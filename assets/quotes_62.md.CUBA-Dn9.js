The organization is named after Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan. The Brennan Center advocates for a number of progressive public policy positions, including raising the minimum wage, opposing voter ID laws, and calling for public funding of elections. The organization opposed the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, which held that the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent political expenditures by nonprofits. The Center's stated mission is to \\"work to hold our political institutions and laws accountable to the twin American ideals of democracy and equal justice for all.\\" The organization's president is Michael Waldman, former director of speechwriting for President Bill Clinton. History and mission The Brennan Center for Justice was founded in 1995 by the family and former law clerks of Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, whom the Washington Post called \\"the progressive voice of the modern court.\\" Justice Brennan's idea of a living constitution figures largely into the center's work.\\"Brennan Center Follows Own Path,\\" Courtside Legal Times, March 25, 1996 The Brennan Center started with an initial grant by the Carnegie Corporation of New York of $25,000 in 1996. The Carnegie Corporation in years since has donated over $3,650,000. During the selection process of what school to center operations from, the Brennan Center selected New York University Law School out of a choice of three schools, with the other two being Harvard University and Georgetown University. The Brennan Center is involved in issues such as opposing voter ID laws that it believes unduly restrict voter registration, and other barriers to registration and voting; and advocating for redistricting reform and campaign finance reform. The organization is part think tank, part public interest law firm, and part advocacy group. Activities The Brennan Center's work is divided into three programs‚ÄîDemocracy, Justice, and Liberty & National Security. Past programs focused on criminal justice, poverty, and economic justice.Schell, Scott (August 27, 2003). \\"The Brennan Center for Justice: Carrying on the Fight.\\" NYC Pro Bono Center News. Retrieved 2011-05-17. The organization has focus on issues both at the national level in the United States, but also at the state and local levels of government. The Brennan Center opposes mass incarceration and produces research on causes of violent crime in the United States. The Brennan Center has represented several detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and also U.S. citizens or legal residents held as unlawful enemy combatants. Attorneys from the Center challenged a U.S. President's authority to declare a prisoner to be an unlawful enemy combatant in the fight against terrorism. The Center has also challenged the U.S. Congress‚Äôs power to deny habeas corpus to such prisoners. The Brennan Center assisted in drafting and enacting the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (\\"BCRA\\"). The law banned soft money contributions to political campaigns. The Center helped Senator Dick Durbin write the Fair Elections Now Act.\\"Durbin, Larson Introduce Fair Elections Now Act, Durbin Announces Hearing on Campaign Finance Reform\\" (April 6, 2011). Press Release, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin. The Brennan Center advocated for the passage in 2010 of New York's law ending prison-based gerrymandering, and was part of a coalition of organizations that sought to defend that law from a court challenge.Lucas, David (May 19, 2011). \\"Civil Rights Organizations File Motion to Defend Law Ending Prison-Based Gerrymandering\\", WAMC Northeast Public Radio. The Brennan Center advocates for the restoration of felon voting rights. The Brennan Center represented plaintiffs Margarita L√≥pez Torres, other unsuccessful judicial candidates, and Common Cause, in a court case that challenged the way New York state trial judge candidates gain access to the ballot. They prevailed in the U.S. District Court and in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. In 2007, attorneys from the Brennan Center argued N.Y. State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres before the United States Supreme Court, but in 2008 the court ruled for the state. In 2015, the Brennan Center submitted an amicus curiae brief with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, urging the state not to overturn its so-called John Doe law, which allows the state to conduct criminal investigations in secret. The Center has been tracking states' legislation on voter ID laws and other barriers to voter registration and voting, to determine whether there is undue burden carried by certain communities. Numerous lawsuits have been brought against states in such cases. By August 1, 2016, rulings in five cases: Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and North Dakota, overturned certain voter ID and other provisions, requiring states to make alternatives acceptable for the November 2016 election cycle.Ariane de Vogue, \\"Voting challenges head toward the Supreme Court: 4 cases to watch\\", CNN, 19 July 2016; accessed 30 July 2016\\"Voter ID Laws Take a Beating in U.S. Courts\\", New York Times, 30 July 2016, p. 1 The Brennan Center research has also indicated that instances of voter fraud by citizens and non-citizens is very rare.

The entire district was located in north-central Seneca County and covered most of Liberty Township, as well as the town of Bettsville itself.http://www.development.ohio.gov/reports/reports_schooldistricts_map_r2.htm When the Midland Athletic League folded in 2014, Bettsville was to become an athletic independent, but its consolidation with Old Fort prevented such an issue. Bettsville's final school year In January 2014, a community forum of 200+ people at the Bettsville school showed that a majority were in favor of letting their district be absorbed into the neighboring school district for Old Fort. This was mainly due to the increasingly large deficit the Bettsville school board was faced with, which was estimated to be around $775,000. The school district was also placed under fiscal emergency on February 6, 2014 by state auditor Dave Yost. Old Fort was decided as the best fit after approaching other neighboring districts because Bettsville and Old Fort already shared administration and staff. Bettsville's school became a much- needed K-6 building for Old Fort while the 7-12 students would attend Old Fort High School. Other less popular options voted on were to keep Bettsville open, but make severe cuts to staff and extracurricular activities while asking for a levy to pass; or to allow the students to open-enroll at other districts and keep the building open solely to be cared for by a maintenance staff. Bettsville's board of education approved the resolution to join under Old Fort, which was then approved by Old Fort's board. For the 2014‚Äì15 school year, Bettsville's district territory transferred to Old Fort's.

Eldredgeops is a genus of trilobites in the order Phacopida, family Phacopidae, known from the late Middle and earliest Upper Devonian of Morocco and the USA.  Description  Like in all sighted Phacopina, the eyes of Eldredgeops are composed of very large (0.5mm in Eldredgeops rana), separately set lenses without a common cornea (so called schizochroal eyes), and like almost all other Phacopina, the articulate mid-length part of the body (or thorax) in Eldredgeops has 11 segments. In contrast to the related Phacops, Eldredgeops generally has a raised ridge along the ventral margin of the cephalon, the glabella is more inflated, the lateral parts of the preoccipital ring are rectangular (and not round), the palpebral area and palpebral lobe are larger than in P. latifrons (the type species of Phacops), and there is no fold right behind the posterior vertical row of lenses nor an isolated raised area just below the lenses.  Distribution  All phacopids died out in North America during the Kaƒç√°k Event at the end of the Eifelian. The phacopids returned to North America during the early Givetian with the emigration of Eldredgeops species from Morocco.  Taxonomy  The species included in Eldredgeops were previously regarded as belonging to Phacops. It was considered however that the post-Eifelian North-American relatives of P. rana differ sufficiently from those found in Africa and Europe to be assigned to a separate genus. The new name is used for the North American species as the type species Phacops latifrons is European. However, old combinations like Phacops rana are widely used among fossil collectors. Pre-Givetian North- American species previously included in Phacops have also been reassigned, such as P. cristatus (now referred to Viaphacops), P. microps and P. raymondi (now Kainops), P. cambelli, P. birdsongensis, P. claviger and P. logani (now Paciphacops).  Species and occurrence  * E. rana (Green, 1832) = Phacops rana rana is present in the Givetian (Middle Cazenovian, Stafford limestone, west New York State; Iowa and adjacent states; Tioughniogan of the Appalachians and New York State) and Frasnian (Chemung sandstones, New York and Maryland). * E. africanus (Burton & Eldredge, 1974) = P. rana africanus, occurs in Morocco * E. crassituberculata (Stumm, 1953) = Phacops rana crassituberculata, appears in the Givetian (Lower Cazenovian) of the USA (Delaware and Dundee Limestone, Ohio; and Soltsville siltstone, east central New York State). * E. milleri (Stewart, 1927) = Phacops rana milleri, has been excavated from the Givetian (Middle and Upper Cazenovian, Tully Formation, New York State; Michigan and Iowa). * E. norwoodensis (Stumm, 1953) = Phacops rana norwoodensis, found in Givetian strata (Traverse Group of Michigan, Milwaukee Formation of Wisconsin, and Cedar Valley Group of Iowa and Illinois). * E. paucituberculata (Eldredge, 1972) = Phacops rana paucituberculata, can be found in the Givetian (Cazenovian) of the USA (Plum Brook shale of north- central Ohio; and Upper Ferron Point shale of northeast Michigan). * E. tindoufensis (Burton & Eldredge, 1974) = P. rana tindoufensis, in found in Morocco.

His writing, which has been described as close to the people's voice, portrays the class struggle and the search for social justice of his countrymen and working class people of the world. His work usually mixes descriptions of the Ibero-American countryside and simple life beauty with naive humour and optimism with proletarian revolution conclusions and tone. This makes his work very popular among the intellectual middle classes and the working classes, specifically the campesinos (countryside people), who identify themselves with Changmar√≠n's personality and language. Changmar√≠n was himself born and raised in the countryside of Panama. Politically persecuted in the past, Changmar√≠n's contributions to Panamanian culture and folklore added to his internationally recognized talent and forced otherwise antagonistic institutions such as the government to recognize his achievements. He has won several national awards (see Awards below). Biography Changmar√≠n was the artistic name used by Carlos Francisco Chang Mar√≠n, which comes from merging both of his surnames (from his paternal surname \\"Chang\\" and maternal surname \\"Marin\\"). It expresses his mixed (Chinese and Creole) heritage. Changmar√≠n was born in Santiago de Veraguas, Panama, being the second son of an out-of-wedlock union between Carlos Chang, a rich, Chinese-Panamanian merchant, and Faustina Marin, a campesina. He grew up among his mother's family, being unable to be acknowledged in public by his father under the conservative values of Panama's countryside of the early 1920s. However, later his father decided to take him from his mother when he was still a child and sent him to live with a paternal aunt. His aunt was brutally abusive, treating him basically as a slave, constantly humiliating his mixed heritage and his mother's social status. The father, although not participating in the abuse, provided no protection from it and even promoted this behavior in some cases. It is not known when Changmar√≠n left his aunt's house, but he went to Panama City, where he did a series of odd jobs. One of these jobs included working at the Panama Canal under the supervision of U.S. managers, where he witnessed the unfair and abusive conditions between the U.S. personnel and the non-U.S. workers. This added to similar experiences he had had while living with his aunt, who belonged to the richer sector of her hometown. He became determined to establish his proletarian struggle visions and political activism. Changmar√≠n returned to formal education at the Juan Demostenes Arosemena Normal School (founded in 1938). He was mentored by intellectuals from South America and Europe, most of whom were victims of European fascism, which helped to consecrate and refine his ideals. He also undertook brief studies in the Panama National Conservatory of Music, which he did not complete. Between 1940 and 1950, Changmar√≠n worked as a teacher in several provinces, where he organized the student movement in strikes to denounce key issues regarding the country's social problems. This resulted in his being fired from his post. During this period, he was incarcerated several times, but this did not stop him from working in several jobs while in prison. He estimates that he spent some four years of his life behind bars. After being in and out of prison under political charges, Changmar√≠n was finally exiled to Chile in 1968. While living there, he studied painting at the Universidad National de Chile and became very active in the Salvador Allende presidential campaign. Once he was allowed to return to Panama, Changmar√≠n established himself in several leadership and organizational roles within the Communist movement. He continuously worked in his artistic endeavours to deliver social and cultural messages. During this period resulted he was nationally recognized as one of the persons responsible for the Panama Canal struggle against the United States. This struggle ended with the United States returning the operational control of the Canal Zone, which used to be forbidden for Panamanians. Until his death from stomach cancer, Changmar√≠n lived in his birth town of Santiago de Veraguas with his companion Eneida Romero. He continued to write, paint and participate in political and ecological commentary and activism. The couple had five children, with four of these still living. In addition, it is well known that Changmar√≠n had a passion for nature in general, with a predilection for orchids.  Writings  As one of the main Panamanian writers, his work in literature is prolific. During his career, Changmar√≠n has touched on different genres and styles.  Poetry  Changmar√≠n started writing poetry by the time he was in high school(Juan Dem√≥stenes Arosemena Normal School), mentored at that early period of his artistic life by South American and European teachers, the latter mainly being expatriated victims of the fascist Spanish Franquism. While still in college, he received an honored mention for his participation in the 1942 Ricardo Mir√≥ National Awards with a submission of a book containing poetry entitled Punto e' llanto. At this stage, his work was considered to be part of the Ibero-American's post-vanguardists Second World War authors according to several scholars. Being under the vanguardist influence, his poetry developed a tone of despair with a very obvious revolutionary intent.\\"Itinerario de la Poes√≠a en Panam√°, Tomo II\\" Rodrigo Mir√≥ Dimas L. Pitty, in his book Letra Viva, describes Changmar√≠n's work as a creation where \\"the art is not the reality, but reality's reflection as an artistic image, marked with the author's subjectivism and ideological views; it is also his fiction\\". As a writer, poetry is basically Changmar√≠n's fundamental tool of expression. Once established as a consecrated poet, he reached an outstanding moment in his creation with the book of poetry entitled Poemas Corporales (Corporeal Poems), which was awarded the Ricardo Mir√≥ National Award in 1955. With this work, Changmar√≠n showed himself as a developed poet who has achieved great control over this literary form. Changmar√≠n leaves out as much as possible, which mirrors the trends of the time. This clarity serves as a method to deliver the social and political messages, as most of his works are fundamental. His mastery of the decasyllable writing imprints Poemas Corporales with a classical accent comparable to the Quevedo Verses.  Short Stories  Changmar√≠n's short story collections are quite numerous and touch upon several themes and scopes. He tries to recreate the countryside storytelling and atmosphere to expose the problems concerning land ownership and exploitation suffered by the countryside people. The latifundia is still very common in Ibero-America. It is endorsed by the government, religious as well as right- wing policy-makers (who generally represent the rich sectors of the society) and transnational corporations.‚ÄúCanal: Tres Relatos Paname√±os‚Äù; Casa de Las Am√©ricas Editorial, Cuba 1974 As are most of his works, the short stories are highly political in nature, describing and portraying historical events, as seen in his compendium Noche Buena Mala. Here, stories are related to the events of the 1989 U.S. Military invasion of Panama in (December 20, 1989). When not being used as a way to deliver and expose political, historical and eco-humanistic paradigms, his short stories have been described to be highly emotional and profoundly radical in form. An example of this is his work Seis Madres, possibly being the most researched and analyzed of his works in this genre. It has been described as written by bursts of raw emotions;Gil Blas Tejeira; Writer and Journalist an anti-story,‚ÄúLos Centroamericanos‚Äù Jos√© Mej√≠a, Ph.D and as the first Panamanian short story that could be used to formulate a theory regarding the creative writing process.‚ÄúSociosem√°ntica del Relato una Idea Microanal√≠tica del Cuento en Panam√°‚Äù; Rodrigo Him  Novels  Changmar√≠n has published three novels. He mainly writes in a historical narrative style which has been praised by critics for its attention to detail in the description of the physical frame (flora, fauna, geography) as well as the cultural frame.Nicol√°s de J. Caballero; Writer Changmar√≠n alluded to Victoriano Lorenzo in almost all his larger works for adults and children in an effort to place him as a founding father of Panama. To Chang Mar√≠n, Lorenzo was the first true Panamanian whose life story and identity parallel that of Panama as a nation. His latest novel, targeted mainly to young readers, Las Gracias y las Desgracias de Chico Perico (2005), had a more autobiographical approach.  Children's literature  Having published several books dedicated to reach the youth, Changmar√≠n tries to deliver his social messages in order to promote human sensibilities and awareness to all ages. Through children's literature, he takes advantage of his pedagology formation by using a profound knowledge of the popular and simple art and language. Using attractive illustrations (hand-drawn by himself) and a short-chapter format to ease the interest of young readers, Changmar√≠n has published in several fields, from poetry to history books. Many scholars consider his children's literature works an expression of his tender side without losing his message and they place many of his works in this area as jewels of Panamanian literature.Hena de Zachrisson Part of his creation in this field is inspired by his own experiences as a child and by the constant interaction with his own grand and great-grandchildren, to whom most of these books have been dedicated. Highly recognized in this area are his poems Las Tonadas y los Cuentos de la Cigarra (1975) and La Mu√±eca de Tusa (2001) and the novels El Cholito Que Lleg√≥ a General (1978) and Las Gracias y las Desgracias de Chico Perico (2005).  Essays  Changmar√≠n's works in the field of essays concentrate on the folkloric, artistic, historical and political areas. Many of his essays have been published in international magazines and newspapers. Most of his political essays deal with the relations between the United States of America's policies toward the Panama Canal and Panama in general, as well as its economic models and the impact these have in the region. As a strong proponent of socialism, Changmar√≠n's conclusions portray a critical view to the current international policies of the United States and other pro- globalization countries and organizations such as World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and World Bank.  Journalism  As a journalist, Changmar√≠n has a long history contributing with commentaries and opinions appearing in several Panamanian and international newspapers, especially the Cuban newspaper Granma. He is highlighted among several others by (Milciades Amores C, Mario Riera Pinilla, Alejandro Chock Vald√©s, Gonzalo Castro, Ren√© Gonz√°lez and Eustolio Dar√≠o Him) as a pioneer of the Prensa Chica (small press) movement in Panama, with his participation in El Cholo newspaper. For several years, he had his own newspaper column, Las Famosas Cartas a Tula (The famous letters to my Aunt Tula), in one of the most widely circulated newspapers, La Critica. His column was popular due to his humorous approach to contemporary problems. Parallel to his contributions to the mainstream media, Changmar√≠n founded and directed the weekly bulletin Unidad, an information bulletin publication for the Panamanian Communist Party.  Music  In the field of music, Changmar√≠n has produced a long list of compositions, both in writing lyrics and creating the musical arrangements. One of his best-known creations comprise the lyrics for Tio Caiman, made famous by the Chilean group Quilapay√∫n. The piece has also been recorded in Colombia, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Panama by several music groups. The piece is sometimes sung by spectators in soccer matches and performed at music concerts across Ibero-America. Changmar√≠n is hardly known as the creator, but this is a credit that he does not pursue. The Panamanian Birthday Song, recorded by the DEXA orchestra directed by Edgardo Quintero, is also one of his creations and is considered to be a unique contribution to the Panamanian culture and identity. Another of his records is Alma Paname√±a, which was produced as part of the cultural development programs of the European Union and PROAPEMEP.  D√©cima  Changmar√≠n is a broadly recognized d√©cima composer in Panama. His interest in this field is related to his folklore research and he has been promoting the recognition of this form of expression of the countryside people for more than half a century. As the main coordinator for the Veraguas delegations in the Mejorana National Festival (since 1950), he has become a one-man cultural institution in this art form. Changmar√≠n is the only Panamanian d√©cima composer who published three books dealing with d√©cima composition as well as d√©cimas compilations. The books Socab√≥n, D√©cimas Populares para Cantar (1959), Los Versos del Pueblo (1973) and Cantadera, 130 D√©cimas para Cantar (1995) have been used as references and inspiration to generations of d√©cimas performers.  Activism = Political  Changmar√≠n's political activism reached an important moment in his life with the foundation of the Panamanian Communist Party (Partido del Pueblo) in 1950. Since communism was outlawed at that time by Panamanian law, this initiative was forced to be conducted secretly. The Panamanian government reacted to the growing dissent and communist organization in the countryside by increasing repression, reaching the extremes of perpetrating political assassinations and disappearances. Changmar√≠n used his writings as his main weapon for resistance. For years, he used politically charged d√©cimas as means to educate the people about identity and the struggle at hand. Que se vayan del Canal (I wish they would just leave from the Canal) and Quiero Sembrar un Ma√≠z (I want to plant corn in the Canal Zone) were the songs of the protests against the constant abuse by the United States. His clear and direct writing form serves as a tool for the constant struggles and protests that were taking place in Ibero-America during the 1970s and 1980s. The d√©cima, having a bard-like effect as an artistic expression and Changmar√≠n having mastered the form, managed to merge it with the social angst-ridden echoes of the dispossessed and the nationalist feelings of the people to \\"incense a protest in each fist and a march in each step\\".Mester de Rebeld√≠a, de la poes√≠a Hispanoamericana; Ramiro Lagos  Ecological  Changmar√≠n was a strong proponent of an environmental-friendly way of life and critic of the consumer-oriented free market and industrialization. Having a strong emotional connection with the countryside environment, he actively participates in radio shows commentaries about the topic. Moreover, he expressed an integrated relationship between culture and nature, rejecting the industrial Western concept of progress, instead promoting the philosophy of simple life. Although he never openly endorsed Anarcho-Primitivism, there are clear correlations between his views and the movement.

Absorption of Bettsville's school district In January 2014, a community forum of 200+ people at the Bettsville school showed that a majority were in favor of letting their district be absorbed into the neighboring school district for Old Fort. This was mainly due to the increasingly large deficit the Bettsville school board was faced with, which was estimated to be around $775,000. The school district was also placed under fiscal emergency on February 6, 2014 by state auditor Dave Yost. Old Fort was decided as the best fit after approaching other neighboring districts because Bettsville and Old Fort already shared administration and staff. Bettsville's school became a much-needed K-6 building for Old Fort while the 7-12 students would attend Old Fort High School. Other less popular options voted on were to keep Bettsville open, but make severe cuts to staff and extracurricular activities while asking for a levy to pass; or to allow the students to open-enroll at other districts and keep the building open solely to be cared for by a maintenance staff. Bettsville's board of education approved the resolution to join under Old Fort, which was then approved by Old Fort's board.

He played college football at West Chester State University from 1960 to 1962 where he was twice named a Little All-America and All-East fullback. He was the leading rusher in NCAA Division II as a sophomore and set career and single-season Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference rushing and scoring records that remained unbroken for two to three decades. He averaged 139.5 yards per game over his three years at West Chester, which ranked second all- time in NCAA Division II history at the time. Early years Iacone was born in 1940. He attended Radnor High School in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania, where he earned high school All-American honors in football, and also participated in track and basketball. In 2003, he was part of the first group of athletes inducted into the Radnor High School Hall of Fame. West Chester University Iacone played college football at West Chester State University from 1960 to 1962. He was twice named as one of 11 small college players selected by the Associated Press for its Little All-America team. He received the honor in 1961 and 1962,(available at newspaperarchive.com) and was also selected to the All-East team in 1960 and 1961. He also became the third player in Pennsylvania State College Football Conference history to be selected as a first-team all-conference player in three consecutive years: 1960, 1961, and 1962.(accessible at newspaperarchive.com) Iacone earned the nickname the \\"Radno Ripper\\" while playing football at West Chester. He was able to play fullback on both offense and defense. However, he played principally on offense. West Chester coach, Jim Bonder, told reporters in 1962: \\"We could use Joe both ways, but you can't expect a boy to run the ball 30 times a game and still play defense.\\"(available at newspaperarchive.com) Iacone was later inducted into the West Chester University Athletic Hall of Fame. 1960 season As a sophomore in 1960, Iacone rushed for a school record 1,438 yards in nine games, an average of 160 yards per game. In November 1960, he rushed for 201 yards and scored three touchdowns against Bloomsburg State.(accessible at newspaperarchive.com) Iacone's season rushing total gave him the 1960 NCAA Division II rushing championship.(accessible at newspaperarchive.com) 1961 season As a junior in 1961, Iacone rushed for 1,059 yards. In November 1961, he rushed for 239 yards and two touchdowns in a 21-0 victory over Slippery Rock to lead West Chester to the Pennsylvania State College Football Conference championship.(available at newspaperarchive.com) In a story about the game, The New York Times focused on Iacone's performance: \\"Iacone, a 185-pound junior, carried the ball thirty-three times as West Chester wore down Slippery Rock in the last three quarters.\\" That same month, Sports Illustrated cited Iacone as a small college player who was \\"good enough to play on any football team.\\" The article stated: \\"West Chester (Pa.) State Fullback Joe Iacone, for instance, the stubby, broad-armed young man shown above. As a sophomore Iacone crushed the bid of Northeast Missouri's Dale Mills to win his third straight national rushing crown. Last fall he gained nearly a mile (1,438 yards, to be exact), finishing the season with a wild, 199-yard day against Lock Haven.\\" 1962 season As a senior, Iacone broke his own West Chester record with 1,486 rushing yards. In November 1962, the Associated Press reported: \\"They have a saying at West Chester State College: 'As Iacone goes so will the football team.'\\" In the December 1962 Cement Bowl, he gained 190 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead West Chester to a 46-12 upset victory over Hofstra University.(\\"Joe Iacone and Sophomore Quarterback Terry Eberly led West Chester State to a 46 to 12 triumph over Hofstra today in the Cement bowl football game.\\") Prior to the Cement Bowl, The New York Times wrote: \\"Coach Howdy Myers of Hofstra was chiefly concerned with his team's ability to contain West Chester's mercurial Joe Iacone. This fleet, shifty 185-pound fullback gained 1,270 yards on 196 rushes and scored 16 touchdowns this season.\\" At the end of his playing career at West Chester, Iacone noted that he regretted that many of the eastern schools refused to play West Chester: \\"That really bothers me. I wished they played us. Possibly they are just afraid of being beaten.\\" Records set Iacone was West Chester's leading rusher for three straight years. His 1960 rushing yardage was good for the NCAA Division II rushing title, and his 1962 total was a single-season West Chester rushing record that stood for 40 years.(record broken by Mansfield Eckmeyer) His 1960 and 1962 totals still rank as the second and fourth highest total in the school's history. His career total of 3,983 yards was the West Chester record until 1990 and still ranks second best in the school's history. Iacone also set the Pennsylvania State College Football Conference, now known as the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC), scoring record with 288 points in three seasons, a record that was not broken until 1993. He also tied the conference's single-game scoring record by scoring five touchdowns for 30 points in his final regular season game for West Chester.(available at newspaperarchive.com) His 1960 and 1962 rushing totals stood as the best two single-season totals in PSAC history for more than 25 years, finally being exceeded in 1989.

Iacone said at the time, \\"I was just too small. And I was very nervous and tight. I was just starting to get over my nervousness and I was on my way home.\\" He added, \\"I think they gave me a fair chance. I just wish I had had more time. ... I'm glad I had the chance because I learned so much more about football.\\" He spent the fall of 1963 playing semi pro football and working in a sporting good store.

The screenplay by Susan Minot and Michael Cunningham is based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Susan Minot. Plot The film alternates between two time periods, the 1950s and the present, in which a dying Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) reflects on her past. Her confusing comments about people she never mentioned before leave her daughters, reserved Constance (Natasha Richardson) and restless Nina (Toni Collette), wondering if their mother is delusional. As a young woman in her early twenties, cabaret singer Ann (Claire Danes) arrives at the spacious Newport, Rhode Island, home of her best friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer), who is soon to marry Karl Ross (Timothy Kiefer). Lila's brother (and Ann's college friend) Buddy (Hugh Dancy) introduces her to Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), a young doctor and the son of a former family servant. Buddy tells Ann his sister has always adored Harris, and expresses his concern that she's marrying another man out of a sense of duty rather than love. Inebriated, Buddy passes out, and as Ann and Harris chat they find themselves bonding. On Lila's wedding day, she confesses to Ann that she confronted Harris with her feelings for him and he rebuffed her, so she goes along with the ceremony as planned and marries Karl. At the reception, at Lila's request, Ann sings a song and is joined on stage by Harris. Afterwards Buddy, drunk again, confronts the two about their growing closeness. Then he unexpectedly kisses Harris. As Lila prepares to depart with her new husband, Ann offers to take the bride away with her, but Lila refuses and leaves for her honeymoon. Buddy admits to Ann he has had a crush on Harris since his childhood, though he also claims not to be \\"that way\\" - he denies that this would be okay as Ann assures him. He then changes the subject, confessing he has loved Ann ever since their college days, offering as proof a note she once sent him he has kept in his pocket ever since. Ann is unconvinced. By the sea the younger guests dance drunkenly and dive into the sea from a clifftop: Buddy joins in but fails to surface, prompting a panicked search. When Buddy reappears at the top of the cliff, Ann expresses her anger at the prank and berates Buddy for repressing his sexual orientation and building her up as his true love. She storms off and she and Harris slip off to his secret hideaway, where they make love. Buddy, in search of the couple, stumbles into the road and is hit by a car. His friends find him, but too late to save his life. The following morning, Ann and Harris, oblivious to what transpired the night before, jokingly consider sailing away, but at the Wittenborn house they hear the tragic news of Buddy's death. In the present day, Lila (Meryl Streep) arrives at Ann's bedside to comfort her and reminisce. Ann recalls a day when she ran into Harris in the street in New York City. By then she had one daughter and was on the verge of moving to Los Angeles, and he was married with a son. He intimated he still loved her before the two exchanged cordial goodbyes. As Lila leaves, she tells Nina about Harris and reassures her that her mother did not make any mistakes in her life. Nina sits with Ann, who encourages her daughter to have a happy life. Nina finally musters the courage to tell her boyfriend Luc she is pregnant with their child. An ecstatic Luc proudly announces the news to Constance and promises he always will be there for Nina. Their joy is interrupted by Ann's nurse, who urges the women to rush to their mother's bedside to bid her farewell.

Doherty as Chloe Production notes Filming began in September 2006. The original screenplay, as was the novel, was set in Maine, but according to the commentary on the DVD release of the film, director Lajos Koltai was so taken with the Newport house found by his location scouts he opted to change the setting. A house in Tiverton was used for interior and exterior scenes. Bristol and Providence, Rhode Island, Greenwich Village, and the Upper West Side of Manhattan also were used for external scenes. Most of the automobiles were provided by the Antique Car Barn from Pawtucket, Rhode Island The song \\"Time After Time\\" Ann sings for Lila at the wedding was written in 1947 by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne. The song \\"I See the Moon\\" she later sings to her daughters is based on a traditional nursery rhyme. The film grossed $12,406,646 in the US and $478,928 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $12,885,574. Critical reception Despite a well-established cast, Evening earned mostly negative reviews from critics and currently holds a 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 127 reviews. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote \\"Stuffed with actors of variable talent, burdened with false, labored dialogue and distinguished by a florid visual style better suited to fairy tales and greeting cards, this miscalculation underlines what can happen when certain literary works meet the bottom line of the movies. It also proves that not every book deserves its own film.\\" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle observed \\"The film arrives at a pessimistic and almost nihilistic view of life as something not very important - and then invites us to take strength and comfort in the notion. It's not what you'd expect, and it's certainly not the typical message. It might be the most interesting thing about the picture.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film itself 2¬Ω out of a possible four stars, but praised the cast, writing, \\"the actors...provide flashes of brilliance. Hugh Dancy scores as the plot's catalyst for tragedy. And Claire Danes is stellar as the young Ann...[Mamie] Gummer proves her talent is her own in a star-is-born performance that signals an exceptional career ahead.\\" In the St. Petersburg Times, Steve Persall graded the film C and added \\"Strong performances and an author's weak backbone make Evening a curious mistake...[it] is memorable only for lovely period designs and for casting mothers and daughters to ensure better continuity.\\" Justin Chang of Variety wrote \\"The more immediate problem with this ambitious, elliptical film is Koltai and editor Allyson C. Johnson's difficulty in establishing a narrative rhythm, as the back-and-forth shifts in time that seemed delicately free-associative on the page are rendered with considerably less grace onscreen. In ways reminiscent of Stephen Daldry's film of The Hours, the telling connections between past and present feel calculated rather than authentically illuminating.\\" In Time, Richard Schickel said the film \\"represents perhaps the greatest diva round-up in modern movie history...Wow, you might think, how bad can that be? To which one responds, after two lugubrious hours in their company, really awful. Rarely have so many gifted women labored so tastefully to bring forth such a wee, lockjawed mouse...This may in part because it was Michael Cunningham, author of the book The Hours, another stupefying exercise in unspoken angst, who was hired to punch up the script Susan Minot was trying to make out of her novel. They share screenplay credit for Evening, but even in the press kit you can sense her loathing for his work. He's sort of Henry James without the cojones and definitely the most constipated sensibility the literary community has lately been in awe of. But I suspect that the director, Lajos Koltai, a Hungarian, has even more to do with the film's inertness.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly rated Evening as the second-worst movie of 2007 (behind I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry).

It first aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 13 May 2002. The episode was written by series creator David Wolstencroft and directed by Bharat Nalluri. \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\\" focuses on MI5's activities in stopping a pro-life movement who have smuggled 20 explosive devices to be used against family planning doctors. The episode title is a reference to the sixth Commandment. The pilot went through 30 rewrites and four separate story changes before the BBC were satisfied with the plot. It would be rewritten again following the September 11 attacks, with the purpose of acknowledging the series premise as battling terrorism. Filming took place mostly in London, England using a long lens camera. The idea of using split screen, regularly used by the series, came from Nalluri after filming wrapped up for the episode, and was not inspired by the American television series 24. Following its broadcast, the pilot was seen by over nine million viewers, easily winning its time slot, having nearly doubled viewership from ITV1 at the same time; the ratings went beyond the producers' expectations. However, critics gave varied responses towards the episode. Plot When a car bomb detonates in the Liverpool suburb of Allerton, killing family planning doctor Karen Lynott (Karen Westwood) and severely injuring her young daughter Sarah, Section D of MI5 is on the case. Danny Hunter (David Oyelowo) learns from one of his assets, \\"Osprey\\" (Kelly Rolfe), that the group responsible have smuggled 20 bombs into the country from Ireland. After following her, the team learn that the terrorist responsible for smuggling the bombs and killing Lynott is Mary Kane (Lisa Eichhorn), an American pro-life extremist; she smuggled herself into the country under an assumed name and has been setting up cells across the UK. Section D also learn that Kane may be setting up the attacks in tribute to her husband, who is on death row in Florida following a series of attacks on abortion clinics. Upon tracking the movements of one cell, the Central Intelligence Agency pressure MI5 to extradite Kane back to the United States; such an action will seriously hinder their efforts to find the cells and a put a stop to them. By the time Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) signs the extradition forms, Kane has evaded MI5. In the meantime, Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) goes undercover to pose as a sympathizer to the cell. She lures a member, Rachel (Rachel Power) to the same hospital Sarah Lynott is being treated; Sarah later dies from the extent of her injuries. Senior case officer and team leader Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) attempts to persuade her to stop Kane, believing she has little regard for any life. Rachel leaves in haste, but unbeknownst to her, MI5 bug her mobile phone and record a phone conversation she makes to the cell regarding their next target, Diane Sullivan, a doctor living in London. Tom's team are able to take Sullivan to safety whilst Zoe poses as the target. The team see Kane deliver a bomb to Zoe's car, and prepares to detonate it via mobile phone. To counter the attack, a Bomb Squad jams the signal long enough for Tom to arrest her. During the interrogation, Tom promises to send her to a state in the US where the death penalty does not apply in exchange for the locations of every cell she runs in the UK. After she cooperates, Tom goes back on the deal and delivers Kane to CIA liaison Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who returns her to Florida to be executed. Over the course of the episode, Tom enters a relationship with civilian Ellie Simm (Esther Hall) following an unrelated operation before the events of the episode, going by the pseudonym of civil servant in IT \\"Matthew Archer\\". Production The script was partly rewritten to acknowledge the September 11 attacks, which took place after the scripting was passed; it was made in order to acknowledge the series' genre of battling terrorism. The script for the episode went through 30 drafts, and four separate stories before the BBC were satisfied and ordered the series. Writing the pilot was completed before the September 11 terrorist attacks; after the attacks took place, the producers decided to add mention of the events into the episode in order to acknowledge the fact that the series is about fighting terrorism. Writer David Wolstencroft decided that Tom Quinn would use IT as his cover story for Ellie Simm, because IT has, according to Wolstencroft, \\"something that has an enormous amount of thought and technical fact behind it that nobody would really understand,\\" and according to series producer Jane Featherstone, has people reluctant to be asking questions about. A scene where a cat escaped during Zoe's operation to bug Kane's cottage, and the ensuing search in the rain mirrored an experience during Wolstencroft's early career. It was also intended that the episode established that although spies plan heavily before operations, things can go wrong. Among the main cast, Peter Firth was attracted to appearing on Spooks after hearing of Howard Brenton's involvement in the series. The cast were advised by ex-MI5 officers in order to help give insight into how the characters operate in the spy world and how their personal lives would be affected by it. The character Maisie Simm (Heather Cave), Ellie's daughter, was created because Featherstone believed that \\"children are the best spies of all\\"; Maisie is often seen \\"spying\\" on Tom throughout the episode and first series. Megan Dodds guest starred as Christine Dale; the producers were sufficiently impressed with her performance that she would later return as Dale in the second series. Principal photography took place in November and December 2001. The majority of filming was done with a long lens, which proved difficult as many filming location were short on space. 40 to 50 cuts were made in the first 10 minutes of the episode to quickly introduce the main characters. Filming took part almost entirely in London; some London locations doubled as Liverpool locations, including the hospital, which was filmed in Covent Garden. The hospital scenes were first in the episode to be shot. The scenes set in a cottage in The Wirral were filmed in Surrey; the cottage was dubbed the \\"cottage from hell\\" according to director Bharat Nalluri because of its small size. The Freemasons' Hall in London served as the filming location for Thames House, the headquarters for MI5. The Hall was chosen as the producers felt that both buildings were similar in architecture. The Grid set was filmed in a Kensington medical school. Borough Market was located to film the scenes where Kane is arrested; filming proved to be difficult as they had to reset the scene several times. The idea for split screening came to Nalluri after visiting a pub one night after filming wrapped up. In the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real- life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just two to three hours putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair. Broadcast and reception The pilot was first broadcast on Monday 13 May 2002, during the 9 to 10 pm time slot. The Spooks producers were hoping the ratings for the pilot would achieve at least six million viewers, with a 30 per cent audience share; at the time this would be considered acceptable ratings by the BBC, as it would allow them to further consider Spooks future. The episode ended up with an overnight rating of 9.2 million viewers, with a 41 per cent audience share, easily winning its time slot, and nearly doubling the numbers of ITV1's Helen West, which was viewed by 4.8 million with 22 per cent share in the same slot. The final numbers posted on the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board website was up slightly to 9.6 million viewers, making the Spooks pilot the seventh most viewed BBC One broadcast, and the tenth most viewed broadcast in total the week it aired. Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian called it \\"one of those shiny and insubtantial series,\\" adding that \\"all that leaping out of bed at dawn on the pretext that you have to go and sell a house tends to wear thin.\\" Banks-Smith also called the story \\"slightly unexpected.\\" She also stated \\"Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, so stupid it has to be true.\\" Thomas Sudcliff of The Independent felt it was a \\"different kind of spy drama\\" with \\"a literal description, derived from the sort of rueful story you could imagine being told at an MI5 staff social,\\" and \\"a lot of bullshit too, naturally. This is one of those dramas where colleagues never make small talk but instead launch straight into an urgent purposive shorthand.\\" Joe Joseph of The Times stated that it \\"bears a closer resemblance [...] 24,\\" which \\"shaded the pleasure of this opening episode,\\" but felt that by the end of the episode, Spooks had \\"established a voice of its own.\\" Gerard O'Donovan of The Telegraph thought that the episode \\"proved thoroughly entertaining,\\" and praised Wolstencroft's writing, which O'Donovan felt was \\"confident enough to be playful with its subject - especially regarding Britain's poor-relation relationship with America.\\" Alison Graham of the Radio Times said that after the episode, the series \\"looks like it's going to be great fun,\\" but \\"it's presumably not meant to be taken too seriously, because surely life in MI5 can't be this exciting?\\" ReferencesExternal links * Series 1, Episode 1 at bbc.co.uk Episode 1 at TV.com 2002 British television episodes 1.01 British television pilots Television episodes about abortion ","title":"Thou Shalt Not Kill (Spooks)"},{"id":"9544506","text":"Along with Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas, Mary the mother of James is known as one of the Three Marys, depicted here by Miko≈Çaj Haberschrack (c. 1470) Mary is identified in the synoptic gospels as one of the women who went to Jesus' tomb after he was buried.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara.  Location  Veliki Mokri Lug is the southernmost neighborhood of the municipality of Zvezdara, located on the right side of the Highway Belgrade‚ÄìNi≈°. Surrounding area is still largely unurbanized, but it makes continuous built up area with several other neighborhoods, mostly along roads: Kaluƒëerica on the west, Mali Mokri Lug on the north, Kumodra≈æ on the south and Padina and Medakoviƒá III, through Cvetanova ƒÜuprija.  Geography  Veiki Mokri Lug is located east of the Kumodra≈æ field, on two hills, Mokrolu≈°ko Brdo (234 meters) on the west and Stra≈æarska Kosa, on the south. The settlement developed in the headwaters area of Mokrolu≈°ki Potok, a right tributary to the Sava river, which flows between slopes of these two hills. The area is generally rich in springs and wells, which is obvious from many of the settlement's toponyms (streets like Petko's well, Milo≈°' well, Mitke's well, Little spring, Buljuba≈°a's waters, Creek street) so as from its own name (veliki mokri lug is Serbian for \\"large wet grove\\" as opposed to Mali Mokri Lug, \\"little wet grove\\").  History and population  During the Roman period, the Romans built an aqueduct to conduct water from the hill on which the modern Veliki Mokri Lug is located. At some point it was joining the aqueduct from the nearby Kumodra≈æ Hill, and the water was further conducted to the castrum of Singidunum, predecessor of modern Belgrade. Natural inclination of two hills was used for the water to flow all the way to the city. Until the 1970s, Veliki Mokri Lug was a separate village and a suburban settlement of Belgrade. With the massive administrative reorganization of the Belgrade City limits after the 1971 population census, entire eastern and southern string of more or less urbanized suburbs (Vi≈°njica, Mirijevo, Mali Mokri Lug, Veliki Mokri Lug, Selo Rakovica, Jajinci, Kijevo, Kne≈æevac, Resnik, ≈Ωeleznik, ≈Ωarkovo) were administratively annexed to the Belgrade City proper (u≈æa teritorija grada), turning from the separate settlements into the \\"local communities\\" (mesna zajednica), sub-municipal administrative unit. Population of Veliki Mokri Lug by the official censuses: * 1921 - 1,563 * 1971 - 6,753 * 2002 - 6,376 (as part of Belgrade)  Characteristics  Unlike majority of former suburbs and now neighborhoods on the outskirts of Belgrade, Veliki Mokri Lug kept mainly rural features, which resulted in population stagnation, while some neighboring settlements expanded significantly (Mali Mokri Lug, Kumodra≈æ, Kaluƒëerica). A motion for building the church in the neighborhood originated in 1988, and the construction began in 1990. It was consecrated in 1998 and dedicated to the Saint Hieromartyr Kyriaki, but remained unfinished. Some works were completed later, like the floor made of ceramic granite, but it remained unpainted and without iconostasis.  Cvetanova ƒÜuprija  Cvetanova ƒÜuprija (Serbian Cyrillic: –¶–≤–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞ —õ—É–ø—Ä–∏—ò–∞) is a 3 kilometers long street which connects Veliki Mokri Lug and Medakoviƒá III and a sub-neighborhood of Veliki Mokri Lug developing around it. It goes through the entire western section of the neighborhood, but the term is mostly applied to the previously empty are along the street between Veliki Mokri Lug and Belgrade, which is becoming more and more urbaznied since the early 2000s.

Appearing as a serial in the manga magazine Nakayoshi from the September 2004 issue to the October 2008 issue, the forty-seven chapters were compiled into ten bound volumes by Kodansha, and published from February 2005 to November 2008. It also includes recipes for each featured dish at the end of each chapter. The series marked the first time that Ando illustrated a manga that was not also written by her. Set in modern-day Japan, Kitchen Princess follows Najika Kazami, a cheerful thirteen-year-old who searches for her \\"flan prince,\\" a boy who rescued her from drowning as a young girl and brought a little happiness to her life after her parents' death. In March 2008, Kodansha published a related light novel, Kitchen Princess: Search for the Angel Cake, written by Kobayashi and illustrated by Ando. In 2006, Del Rey Manga licensed the series for an English-language translation in North America. It published the ten volumes from January 2007 to July 2009. Following Kodansha's decision to publish in North America through an imprint, Kodansha USA released a four-volume omnibus edition from June 2012 to June 2013. The series has been well received by English-language readers, with the appearance of three volumes and one omnibus on various bestseller lists and the series appearing twice on ICv2's annual list of the top twenty-five manga properties. Critical reception ranged from positive to lukewarm, and the series won the 2006 Kodansha Manga Award for children's manga. Plot Set in modern-day Japan, the plot centers on , a cheerful thirteen-year-old with an excellent sense of taste who hopes to become a chef. In her backstory, it is revealed that a mysterious boy rescued her from drowning in Hokkaid≈ç as a young, recently orphaned girl and gave her flan to cheer her up. Before he left, she promised to make him the best- tasting dessert in the world. Now on a journey to find her \\"flan prince,\\" as she calls him, Najika attends Seika Academy in Tokyo, after she learned that the silver spoon her flan prince left her is unique to the school. There she befriends , the substitute director of the academy, and his younger brother . Although teen model initially dislikes her, they eventually become friends after Najika heals her eating disorder by making her her grandmother's recipe. Najika periodically competes in cooking competitions, both formal and informal, while working at the diner run by the skilled, yet lazy chef . Najika falls in love with Sora, after he tells her that he is her flan prince. However, he soon dies after being struck by a truck while on a journey to deliver some ingredients to Najika, and, in his final moments, admits that he lied about being her flan prince, having fallen in love with her. She loses her sense of taste out of sorrow, although she quickly recovers it. After Sora's death, Daichi is unable to bring himself to act on his love for her, though he gives in to his father's demands to protect Najika from being kicked out of the school and becomes the student body president to replace Sora. Wealthy and conceited junior pastry chef also begins to attend the school, where he clashes with Najika, whom he had watched bake as a young girl at the orphanage. Seiya eventually falls in love with her, and tries to romantically pursue her, although he gives up when he realizes that she loves Daichi. After Daichi recovers a repressed memory of his mother's death during a family trip to Hokkaid≈ç‚Äîwhich Sora attempted to protect him from by lying about being Najika's flan prince‚Äîhe remembers that he is actually her flan prince, having given her a flan made by Seiya, and accepts her feelings for him. Joyful, she fulfills her promise to him by making him a cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Development The writer of Kitchen Princess, Miyuki Kobayashi, is a novelist published under Kodansha's X Bunko Teen Heart label. When deciding on a story, she first creates the names, then the plot: Najika's name‚Äîmeaning \\"seven\\", \\"rainbow\\" and \\"fragrance\\"‚Äîwas designed to be \\"ethnically ambiguous\\" and carry a sense of nature, while Daichi and Sora's names, meaning \\"earth\\" and \\"sky\\" respectively, were meant \\"to match hers\\". Akane's name, which means \\"deep red,\\" was intended to evoke the evening sun for the reader. Kitchen Princess marked the first time that manga artist Natsumi Ando illustrated a manga that was not also written by her. Despite this, she did make some changes to the original script; she suggested to Kobayashi that Hagio, the head of the orphanage, be an elderly woman and Fujita, initially an elderly woman, a \\"rugged man\\". Ando made it a personal rule to have each of the splash pages contain an illustration of food. Media=Manga Written by Miyuki Kobayashi and illustrated by Natsumi Ando, the forty-seven chapters appeared as a serial in the sh≈çjo (targeted towards girls) manga magazine Nakayoshi from the September 2004 issue to the October 2008 issue. Kodansha collected the chapters into ten bound volumes, and published them from February 4, 2005, to November 6, 2008. At the 2006 Comic-Con, Del Rey Manga announced that it had licensed Kitchen Princess for an English-language translation in North America. Del Rey published the volumes from January 30, 2007, to July 7, 2009. Following Kodansha's decision to publish its titles in North America through an imprint, including those formerly licensed to Del Rey Manga, Kodansha USA later published a four-volume omnibus edition of Kitchen Princess from June 5, 2012, to June 18, 2013. Digital editions of the series have also been published by Kodansha in the United Kingdom. The series has also been licensed in Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan. Light novel On March 19, 2008, Kodansha published a light novel written by Kobayashi and illustrated by Ando, . Comprising four story arcs named after the seasons, the novel follows Najika's quest to duplicate a white cake recipe for a classmate's grandmother. Del Rey published an English-language translation on November 10, 2009. Reception Kitchen Princess was well received by English-language readers, with three original volumes and one omnibus volume placing on either BookScan's list of the top twenty bestselling graphic novels, or The New York Times manga bestseller list. The sixth volume placed eighteenth on BookScan's list for May 2008. The seventh volume appeared at the fifteenth spot for BookScan's list for August 2008. In 2009, the tenth volume debuted at the seventh place on The New York Times manga bestseller list for the week of July 5 to 11; during the following week, it dropped to the eighth place and remained there for another week. In 2012, the second volume of the omnibus edition appeared at the ninth place for the week of October 14‚Äì20. The series placed nineteenth on ICv2's top twenty-five manga properties for 2008, dropping to the twentieth spot a year later. The series also placed seventh on ICv2's list of the top ten sh≈çjo properties for 2009, and appeared at the eighth spot of the ten bestselling sh≈çjo series for the first quarter of 2010. Kitchen Princess won the Kodansha Manga Award for children's manga in 2006. The series has received a range of reviews, from positive to lukewarm. Publishers Weekly enjoyed that Najika was not given a magical power and had to keep improving her cooking skills. Although the reviewer for School Library Journal described the series as \\"a perfectly ordinary romance manga,\\" he praised Nunzio Defilippis and Christina Weir's adaptation of the manga. Deb Aoki of About.com listed the manga as one of the best sh≈çjo series. Jason Thompson rated the series 3.5 out of 4 stars, describing it as \\"[a] quick, delightful read.\\" Another reviewer for Publishers Weekly, Johanna Draper Carlsen, wrote that she found the manga reminiscent of the romantic comedy film Simply Irresistible (1999) and that the manga contained conventional sh≈çjo aspects. In a later review of the second volume, she described the series as \\"entertaining enough, but it‚Äôs fluffy and forgettable (like so many of the mousse items and drinks Najika makes). The volumes already feel familiar, even as I‚Äôm reading them for the first time.\\" Mania Entertainment's Sakura Eries expressed her lukewarm feelings towards the first volume, writing that the reader's suspension of disbelief was vital to enjoying the manga. She disliked the two-dimensional characterization and Ando's illustrations of the characters, although she felt that the food was well-drawn. Comparing the series to others in the cooking genre, she wrote that it differed in that \\"cooking is Najika's expression of self and her means of creating relationships and drawing others to common ground (like the estranged Kitazawa Brothers).\\" In follow-up reviews of the second and third volumes, she remained lukewarm to the series; she praised Kobayashi's portrayal of Akane's eating disorder, though she disliked how Najika's quest to find her flan prince seemed to become more of a side-plot. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised Najika as a likeable protagonist and the characterizations as believable. He enjoyed the plot and recipes, although he wrote that the character designs lacked creativity, and criticized the plot clich√©s and the antagonists' weak characterization. He had mixed feelings about the fourth volume's emphasis on conventional sh≈çjo romance and plot twists at the cost of its cooking aspect. He found the artwork conventional, though able to convey emotion. He wrote that the fifth volume finally balanced the romance and cooking elements, although he disliked the inclusion of a side story, preferring another chapter instead. In his review of the seventh volume, he concluded: \\"this series takes the hoariest elements of the romance/drama/cooking genres and still manages to come up with something greater than the sum of its parts.\\" Reviews of the light novel varied. Draper Carlsen wrote that the characters and premise lacked the strength to make the novel compelling, though she felt that the response of others may differ. Grading the novel a B, Eries wrote that the novel would appeal to fans of the manga, although she found the story arcs varying in quality and content, from junior-high school romance to philosophy on death.

Bangladesh Standard Time (BST) () is the time zone of Bangladesh. It is offset six hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time, and observed as a national standard throughout the country. Bangladesh briefly observed daylight saving time (DST) in 2009 to cope with the ongoing electricity crisis, but in 2010 the decision was cancelled by the government of Bangladesh. The official time signal is given by the Bangladesh Standard Time is calculated on the basis of the 90.00¬∞ E longitude, which passes over the Harukandi Union of Harirampur Upazila of the Manikganj District in Dhaka Division, Bangladesh. In the IANA time zone database, it is represented by Asia/Dhaka.  History  Between 1890 and 1941, the Bengal region was under British Raj and used Calcutta time (UTC+5:53:20). For a brief period in the 1940s, amidst World War II, there were a series of time zone changes in British India. # On 1 October 1941, the region switched to UTC+06:30. # On 15 May 1942, the following year, the region switched to UTC+05:30. # On 1 September 1942, the same year, the region was returned to UTC+06:30. Following the independence of India in 1947, British India was partitioned into India and Pakistan, of which East Pakistan is now Bangladesh. The time zone of East Pakistan was not immediately affected by the partition. In 1951, the region changed its time from UTC+06:30 to UTC+06:00, the official time zone used today.  Daylight saving time  The power division of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources proposed the DST scheme, discussing it with representatives from 18‚Äì19 different ministries on 5 April 2009, and were asked to return their views by 9 April. Most of the responses from the ministries were positive. June was selected instead of April or May, as the HSC examinations are run from 18 April through 28 May. The time was advanced by exactly 1 hour on the midnight of 19 June, and was planned to be set back two months later on the midnight of 30 September. The proposal primarily sought to reduce energy usage, as the energy crisis was the most severe in that period, with power demands of 4,800‚Äì5,800 MW against a generation capability of 3,800‚Äì4,000 MW. The time zone was advanced from UTC+06:00 to UTC+07:00. Government officials in support of the scheme said that it was easier to save power than to generate more, but ultimately the scheme proved a failure. The change was criticised as early as days after the adoption of the scheme. People had not become accustomed to the change and businesses and shop owners had not followed the government's directives properly. Citizens also complained that the load-shedding situation hadn't improved. Power savings were nulled by increased consumption in the days following the change because of hot weather, as well as any residual savings being consumed by people who previously had less access to electricity. The country went back to its original UTC+06:00 time offset on the midnight of 31 December 2009, months later than the scheduled end and through the winter. Students and teachers were the first to be adversely affected as many had to leave for their institutions before sunrise. In December, the problem became worse, and the cabinet lifted the scheme. DST was due to be observed again from 31 March through to 31 October in 2010. However, on 22 March 2010, the cabinet cancelled the scheme permanently, citing \\"public interest\\" and decided to remain in the former UTC+06:00 offset.

A leading Unconditional Unionist during the American Civil War, he became one of the founders of West Virginia.West Virginia Biographical Dictionary, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=VkkKcEPkp98C&pg;=PA24&lpg; Early and family life Born in Kingwood, Virginia (now West Virginia), on the Northwestern Turnpike to James Brown (1761-1837), a native of Scotland and his wife. W.G. Brown received a private education appropriate to his class as a child, then read law. On July 3, 1828, he married Juliet Ann Roberts Byrne (1810-1851), the daughter of Major Charles Patrick Byrne (1775-1843), who served as the Preston County clerk and circuit court clerk from 1818 until his death.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/31175441 The widower remarried in 1885, in Monongalia County to Margaret P.

Brown lost his bid for re-election to William Carroll but in 1839 defeated Carroll and again served part-time in the House of Delegates from 1840 to 1843 (winning re-election once in the interim). In 1844 Congressman Lewis Steenrod decided not to seek re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 15th congressional district, and Brown was elected to replace him. Likewise a Democrat, Brown won re-election to the United States House of Representatives and served from 1845 to 1849, being defeated in the Democratic primary of 1848 by Alexander Newman, who succeeded him. Preston County voters nonetheless elected Brown as their delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention in 1850. A delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1860 in both Charleston, South Carolina and Baltimore, Maryland, Brown was a presidential elector for losing candidate Stephen A. Douglas. Preston county voters elected him as one of two delegates to represent them at the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, where he spoke and voted against secession. However, after he and fellow Preston County delegate James Clark McGrew were in the minority during the second secession vote, they protested, and ultimately Preston County sent several representatives the following month to the Wheeling Convention, which wanted to remain part of the Union. On June 29, 1861, pro- secession delegates at the Virginia Convention voted to expel Brown and McGrew, although they were not actually present at the Wheeling Convention. On October 24, 1861, five Preston County men in a Confederate Camp in Pocahontas County replaced them with secessionist Preston County lawyers Charles J. P. Cresap and Robert E. Cowen. In 1860 Congressman Sherrard Clemens of Virginia's 10th congressional district announced he would not seek re-election, although he like Brown would be elected as an anti-secessionist to the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 (from Wheeling. Voters again elected Brown to the U.S. House, this time as a Unionist, and he served (and was seated, unlike many Virginia secessionists) from 1861 to 1863. Upon the new state of West Virginia being admitted to the Union, voters re-elected Brown as an Unconditional Unionist, and he served for the last time in Congress representing West Virginia's 2nd congressional district from December 7, 1863 until March 3, 1865. Brown did not seek re-election as the war was ending and resumed his legal practice in Kingwood. Fellow Unionist Capt. George R. Latham succeeded him. By 1870, Brown lived in Rowlesburg, West Virginia, Preston County's second largest town, with a major lumber industry and a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad station, and convenient access to the Cheat River.

He was a member of the Visconti family of Pisa and the first of that dynasty to rule in Sardinia, where they lasted in Gallura for almost another century. His grandfather, Alberto, was a patrician of Pisa, while his father, Eldizio, was patrician and consul (1184‚Äì1185). He and his brother Ubaldo in turn served as patrician and podest√†. Lambert's grandmother was Aligarda and his mother was a daughter of Torchitorio III of Cagliari. In 1207, Elena chose of her own will to marry Lambert, despite the fact that Pope Innocent III, to whom she and her state were pledged, had arranged a marriage with one of his own relatives. In 1209, Comita III of Logudoro invaded Gallura and took Civita and briefly held sway over the hold kingdom, but Lambert and his Pisan allies soon retook it. Between 1210 and 1215, with more Pisan support, Lambert attacked Logudoro and Arborea. In 1215, profiting from the weakness of Benedetta of Cagliari, he assembled a large fleet and landed an army at Cagliari. He captured the adjacent hill, which dominated the city, and fortified it. He gave the job of finishing up the conquest to his brother Ubaldo. Elena died before 1220 and in that year, after the death of Torchitorio IV of Cagliari, Ubaldo arranged the marriage of his widow Benedetta to his brother Lambert. Lambert thus controlled two giudicati comprising most of Sardinia, the one in the right of his now-deceased wife and the other in the right of his stepson William II. Lambert died in 1225 and was succeeded by his son Ubaldo in Gallura. Sources *Ferrabino, Aldo (ed). Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani: I Aaron ‚Äì Albertucci.

It consists of several buildings, with the core of the site formed by buildings around a rectangular courtyard. The Roscheider Hof was first mentioned in a record dating from 1330. During the 1978 renovations a few parts of a building came to light that could be dated to the early 16th century. For instance, there is a small walled window with late Gothic splays. Until the French Revolution in 1794 (when revolutionary troops conquered the Trier region), it was an agricultural estate owned by the St. Matthias Benedictine monastery, which still exists today. As part of the secularisation of these years, the estate was auctioned off in 1805 to the credit of the French state and acquired by Nicholas Valdenaire, who had come to the nearby town of Saarburg as a French soldier in 1801 and married there. Valdenaire extended the estate and enlarged the Roscheider Hof buildings with extensive renovations. He and his son Victor played a prominent role in the 1848 revolution: they were deputies in the provincial parliament, in the state parliament, in the Prussian national assembly in Berlin and in the first German parliament in the Paulskirche in Frankfurt, and were even imprisoned several times for such activities.

It is omnivorous, feeding on vegetables, insects, crabs, snails and other items, but apparently preferring palm fruits and palm kernels. Unlike domestic rats, it has cheek pouches like a hamster. These cheek pouches allow it to gather up several kilograms of nuts per night for storage underground. It has been known to stuff its pouches so full of date palm nuts so as to be hardly able to squeeze through the entrance of its burrow. The burrow consists of a long passage with side alleys and several chambers, one for sleeping and the others for storage. The Gambian pouched rat reaches sexual maturity at 5‚Äì7 months of age. It has up to four litters every nine months, with up to six offspring in each litter. Males are territorial and tend to be aggressive when they encounter one another. Laboratory use The Gambian Pouched rat is currently being used in psychology experiments at Cornell University in the USA to investigate its usefulness in the detection of tuberculosis in human sputum samples.  Invasive species  A Gambian pouched rat killed in the Florida Keys Gambian pouched rats have become an invasive species on Grassy Key in the Florida Keys, after a private breeder allowed the animals to escape. This outsized African rodent is also believed to be responsible for the 2003 outbreak of monkeypox in the United States, after spreading it to prairie dogs which were purchased as pets. In 2003, the United States' CDC and FDA issued an order preventing the importation of the rodents following the first reported outbreak of monkeypox. Around 20 individuals were affected. Ability to detect land mines and tuberculosis by scent A Tanzanian social enterprise founded by two Belgians, APOPO, trains Gambian pouched rats to detect land mines and tuberculosis with their highly developed sense of smell. The trained pouched rats are called HeroRATS. The rats are far cheaper to train than mine-detecting dogs; a rat requires $7,300 for nine months of training, whereas a dog costs about $25,000 for training. In 2020 a Hero Rat received a PDSA Gold Medal, the animal equivalent of the George Cross, becoming the first rat to receive the award since the charity began honouring animals 77 years ago. 'Magawa' has detected 39 landmines and 28 items of unexploded ordnance, clearing over 1,517,712 square feet [141,000 square metres.] of land, preventing many injuries and deaths, in his 4 year career so far. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-54294192 https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/landmine-detection-rat-magma- cambodia-award- charity-b575565.html?utm_content=Echobox&utm;_medium=Social&utm;_source=Facebook&#Echobox=1601017750 See also *APOPO *Giant pouched rat  References  * Novak, R.M. and Paradiso, J.L.; Walkers Mammals of the World, Vol II.

It lived during the final stage of the Devonian, the Famennian, and became extinct at the end of this stage, together with all other trilobites with the exception of some Proetida. It can be found in Australia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Iran, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Poland, the Russian Federation (Urals), Spain, and the United Kingdom (England).  Distribution  Species belonging to the genus Trimerocephalus have been found in Europe, Morocco, Iran and Australia. * T. caecus has been found in the Upper Devonian (Lower Famennian) of Poland (Holy Cross Mountains), Germany (Harz Mountains, Rhineland, Thuringia), the Russian Federation (Ural Mountains), North Africa, and France (Armorican Massif). * T. lentiginosus has been excavated from the Upper Devonian of the Russian Federation (Famennian, South Ural Mountains). * T. cryptophthalmoides is present in the Upper Devonian (Lower Famennian) of Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation (South Ural Mountains). * T. dianopsoides occurs in the Upper Devonian of Poland (Famennian, Holy Cross Mountains). * T. interruptus is deposited in the Upper Devonian of Poland (Famennian, Holy Cross Mountains). * T. lacunosus has been identified in the Upper Devonian of Germany (Famennian, Thuringia). * T. lelievrei was collected in the Upper Devonian of Morocco (Famennian, Tafilalt). * T. mastophthalmus is known from the Upper Devonian of Germany (Lower Famennian, Rhineland, Harz Mountains, Thuringia), Poland (Holy Cross Mountains), England, southwestern Asia, and Kazakhstan. * T. mimbi has been found in the Upper Devonian of West-Australia (Famennian, McWhae Ridge, west side South Lawford Range, Virgin Hills Formation). * T. nigritus is present in the Upper Devonian of France (lower Famennian, Red cephalopod limestones, lower member of \\"griottes\\" limestones formation, Lower Palmatolepis rhomboidea subzone, Old quarry of Concours-le-Haut near Causses- et-Veyran, Montagne Noire). * T. polonicus occurs in the Upper Devonian of Poland (Famennian, Holy Cross Mountains). * T. procurvus has been identified in the Upper Devonian (Famennian) of Spain (Cantabrian Mountains) and Germany. * T. shotoriensis was excavated from the Upper Devonian of Eastern Iran (Famennian, lower Palmatolepis marginifera- to upper Palmatolepis trachytera- zone, Shotori-Range). * T. sponsor has been identified in the Upper Devonian (Famennian) of the Czech Republic (Moravia) and Spain (Cantabrian Mountains). * T. steinachensis is known from the Upper Devonian of Germany (Famennian, Thuringia, Harz Mountains). * T. tardispinosus has been found in the Upper Devonian of Australia (Famennian, Palmatolepis rhomboidea-zone; McWhae Ridge, west side South Lawford Range, Virgin Hills Formation). * T. trifolius occurs in the Upper Devonian of Poland (Famennian, Holy Cross Mountains). * T. vodorezovi is present in the Upper Devonian of Kazakhstan (Famennian).  Taxonomy  the relationships between species assigned to Trimerocephalus'Acuticryphops is probably ancestral to Trimerocephalus, and mainly differs from its descendants in having an eye lobe with a small number of lenses. Cr√¥nier, 2003, erected the subgenus Trimerocephalus (Trifoliops) containing T. trifolius and T. nigritus. In order not to be polyphyletic, T. (Trifoliops) would need to include at least T. steinachensis, and preferably T. dianopsoides as well. These species are in the same clade as T. mastophtalmus however, which is the type of the genus Trimerocephalus, which would by definition be in the nominal subgenus Trimerocephalus (Trimerocephalus). This in turn would prompt the erection of another subgenus with all remaining species shown in the cladogram.  Description  Trimerocephalus is one of several phacopid genera that is eyeless (others being Dianops, Ductina, and Trimerocephaloides). The dorsal facial sutures are not functional, so cranidia and free cheeks (or librigenae) are not found separated. The marginal ridge bordering the cheeks is wide and convex. The part of the margin that is tucked-under (or doublure) and only visible when viewing the cephalon from the belly (or ventral side), is short and flat. The vincular furrow, a groove that fits the margin of the tailpiece or pygidium when the animal was enrolled, is wide and deep. The pygidium is about 3 times wider than long.

It first aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2002, on a Tuesday; the other first series episodes aired on Mondays. The episode was written by Howard Brenton, and directed by Rob Bailey. The episode focuses on MI5 and 6's efforts in taking down a terrorist cell before they can succeed in attacking 43rd President of the United States George W. Bush. The episode guest stars Anthony Head and Hugh Laurie, who play their respective characters Peter Salter and Jools Siviter. After its first broadcast, \\"Traitor's Gate\\" was seen by 6 million viewers, the lowest ratings in the first series. Plot After getting shot during the Turkish consulate raid in the previous episode, Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is on sick leave until he recovers. When Ellie (Esther Hall) notices Tom's wound, he feels compelled to tell her that he is a spy. Over the course of the episode, Ellie threatens to leave Tom unless he also explains his job to her daughter, Maisie (Heather Cave). After he does, Ellie begins to forgive him for having lied to her ever since they met. Danny (David Oyelowo) and Zoe (Keeley Hawes) observe an anti- globalisation rally before Bush's visit, where a riot ensues led by a man in a flaming helmet, who spots the two and flees with a young woman, Andrea Chambers. When they are surrounded by riot police, the man reveals himself as Peter Salter (Anthony Head), a legendary MI5 officer who recruited Tom. They contact Tom after they weren't briefed about the situation. Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) admits that Salter is working with Harry and Jools Siviter (Hugh Laurie) at MI6 in a joint operation to take down a European anarchist terror group led by Istvan Vogel. In order to get into the cell, Salter has been sleeping with Andrea. Upon meeting him, Tom questions Salter's allegiance after learning he is in love with Andrea; Tom reluctantly allows the operation to continue, but displays his concern to Harry. Tom's concerns are revealed to be correct, as Salter and Andrea evade Danny and Zoe. Zoe is sent to meet up with one of Tessa's (Jenny Agutter) contacts, who may have information on where Salter is. However, upon waiting, Tessa arrives; Zoe works out that Tessa is running several phantom agents and pockets their money. In order to keep Zoe quiet, Tessa bribes her ¬£10,000. Salter meets with Vogel in Wales. There, Salter offers his plan to take down the President; they break into a University researching Geographic Topology. There, Salter breaks into the database and manipulates the flightpath of Bush's plane, and the nearby topography to cause the plane to crash. By the time all but Salter leave, Armed Police arrive and arrest Salter, who is brought to Thames House. After reluctantly telling Tom where Vogel's group are hiding, Salter hangs himself before revealing what he did in the campus. Harry learns about Danny hacking his way into improving his credit rating, and destroys his credit cards. As punishment, Danny is to train new staff. There, he learns of Salter's intentions; the plane is diverted to Paris. In the end when Ellie asks Tom about his day, he replies; \\"a man, who believed in a cause, killed himself for love, totally pointless.\\" Production \\"Traitor's Gate\\" was written by Howard Brenton. He was pleased to be chosen to write the episode, as he got to write the pivotal part of the episode when Tom reveals to Ellie that he is a spy. During the writing, Brenton was simply told in a note that \\"he tells her\\", and had to work out how. Brenton chose to adopt the same writing style based on the early episodes of Taggart; Brenton was impressed by the way the episodes seemed to have more to the plot half way through. The location where Tom and Salter meet in the middle of the episode was to be set in the Millennium Dome; this would later change to North Greenwich tube station. The scene had to be rewritten several times to reflect Tom questioning Salter's allegiance. Much of the scene was actually automated dialogue replacement. Later on, Brenton wanted to figure out how Salter would evade Danny and Zoe; when he couldn't figure it out, he asked a source for help, who simply suggested him to have Salter call the Police about Zoe and Danny having sex in their car and there are children about. The introduction of Tessa being corrupt by running phantom agents was allegedly based on real life situations. In the series, the idea was made on the concept that MI5 officers have temptations to make money. The written scenes where Salter confesses to Tom was somewhat inspired by Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The scene was for the two to act as friends rather than interrogator and suspect. The character of Peter Salter was written in a way that for most of the episode, the viewing audience would guess which side Salter was really on. Anthony Head, who was well known for his role as Rupert Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was cast as Peter Salter; during the audition, producer Simon Crawford Collins noted that Head performed it so well, that he would be perfect for the role, and was hired. Hugh Laurie was cast as Jools Siviter; the character was created because of bringing in a lighter element to a generally serious series. The character was also created this way as, according to David Wolstencroft, some people in intelligence and military are generally \\"funny people\\", although they have been through \\"some pretty heinous things\\". It also became the first episode to feature MI6; the service was depicted as more \\"old school\\" compared with MI5, which the series sources confirmed. The episode was filmed before the third episode, \\"One Last Dance\\". The first day of filming involved the scenes between Head and Brownen Davies (Andrea), which was filmed in an art house. Due to timing constraints, part of the sequence had to be cut down. A few of the scenes where Tom reveals to Ellie were filmed with a hand-held camera; this is the first time such a technique was used in Spooks. The anti- globalisation riots in the teaser of the episode were originally going to be staged, but due to budget constraints most of the riot was edited from several pieces of real-life news footage  although part of the riot, particularly involving Salter, was staged. The scene was filmed by two separate units. The building Danny and Zoe used to observe overlooked the filmed riot. The scene where Tessa explains her treachery to Zoe was filmed at the women's public swimming baths of Hampstead Heath. The scene called for the baths to be empty; every time anyone would want a swim, the filming crew would have to halt. But because it was filmed in a cold winter's day, nobody from the public went. The setting for the terror group in the abandoned Ministry of Defence base in Wales was based on one of Brenton's friends, who lived in Mid Wales near a vast training base. The forest was filmed in an army training base in Surrey, south of London. Reception After its original airing on BBC One, \\"Traitor's Gate\\" was seen by 5.99 million viewers in the UK, making Spooks the seventeenth most viewed broadcast on BBC One, and the thirty-second most viewed broadcast in total during the week; the episode became the lowest rated episode in the entire first series. As of April 2010, members of the user- contributed television review sites the Internet Movie Database and TV.com rated the episode at 7.9 and 9.1 (rated \\"Superb\\") out of 10 respectively.

History Requests for a light to mark the point date as far back as 1838, but the original light on this site was erected in 1858 by Ellis and O'Neil, along the same lines as the Windmill Point and Isle La Motte lights, which they constructed in the same period. The light sat on a small point due east of the ruins of Fort St. Frederic, a 1730s - 1750s fort at the tip of the peninsula. The octagonal stone tower and attached keeper's dwelling remained in use, essentially unchanged, into the early 20th century. The tercentenary of Champlain's explorations of the lake provided the occasion for celebrations marking the event, and commissions from New York and Vermont, put in charge of the festivities, decided to erect a monument. A suggestion in a newspaper prompted the notion to convert an existing lighthouse, and after some consideration of other sites, the Crown Point Light was chosen. The stone sheath of the tower was stripped away, leaving the brick spiral staircase sitting on the foundation. A new tower was constructed on and around this, consisting of a short tapered base, a ring of eight Doric columns, an elaborately carved cornice and parapet, and a new lantern atop the whole. On the side facing the lake, a projection from the base supported a monumental bronze designed by Carl Augustus Heber and cast at the Roman Bronze Works consisting of Champlain accompanied by one fellow Frenchman and one Huron native.\\"Crown Point Lighthouse\\" Lighthouse Friends website, http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=672 The French government sent a plaque by Auguste Rodin which was later placed below the other sculpture. A broad staircase led down to a pier projecting into the lake. A fifth order Fresnel lens continued to shine in the lantern giving a fixed white light, and the old keeper's house remained in place, attached to the new tower by a short passageway. The memorial was dedicated on July 5, 1912 at a ceremony presided over by Governors John Abner Mead of Vermont and John Adams Dix of New York. The memorial served as an active lighthouse for only fourteen years. In 1926 its light was extinguished, and a small skeleton tower was erected immediately adjacent to the water. In 1931 construction of the Crown Point Bridge obscured the site, and the steel tower was moved to the grounds of the Windmill Point Light as part of the customs service effort to control liquor smuggling on the lake. The property was transferred to the State of New York, which continues to maintain it as part of the state reservation which forms the tip of the peninsula; the keeper's house was demolished, leaving the monument standing alone at the top of the bluff. The tower is marked on navigational charts, but does not currently serve as an aid to navigation. NotesReferences  Further reading * Oleszewski, Wes.

They issued three studio albums, Along Woodland Rides, Through Tunnels of Evergreen (1995), Oberon (1999) and The Birds Album (2001) before disbanding in 2002.  History  In 1993 bass guitarist, Grant Shanahan (ex-Slaybells, the Honeys, Catherine Wheel), was developing a new group in Sydney. He placed an ad for a lead guitarist, and it was answered by Bek-Jean Stewart, who played acoustic guitar and sang. She performed on a live radio broadcast, which he agreed to listen to and consequently hired her to form Eva Trout, ahead of another guitarist and vocalist. The band released a five-track, self-titled extended play in 1994. In 1995 Steph Miller (ex- Roaring Jack) joined on keyboards ahead of their first studio album, Along Woodland Rides, Through Tunnels of Evergreen, for Phantom Records. During recording sessions their original drummer and guitarist left. Shanahan, Stewart and Miller continued with session musicians, Matt Galvin on lead guitar, and former bandmate, Bert Thomson (ex-the Honeys, Catherine Wheel) on drums. Galvin and Thomson joined the line-up of Eva Trout. The group were signed to United States label, Trauma Records/Interscope Records (home to No Doubt and Bush), in 1996 after Atlanta radio station, WNNX, had added their track, \\"Beautiful South\\", to heavy rotation. The group undertook a US promotional tour including radio appearances. In January 1997 their debut album was re-recorded for US release in the following month as a self-titled album. While the band's exposure in the US seemed to poise it for success, label difficulties (Trauma/Interscope and No Doubt were involved in contractual and legal battles) prevented the band attaining a wider recognition. The band released their second studio album, Oberon in 1999 via Origin Records/Shock Records. They recorded it over ten days in June on a farm, \\"Fernlee\\", near Oberon, New South Wales with Michael Carpenter as producer. The line-up was Galvin on guitars (acoustic, electric), keyboards and vocals; Miller on keyboards, mandolin, banjo, vocals and acoustic guitar; Shanahan on bass guitar and vocals; Stewart on lead vocals, acoustic guitar, harp and percussion; Thomson on drums was replaced by Carpenter for a track, \\"Light Sleeper\\". Thomson left the group and Carpenter joined. Jasper Lee of Oz Music Project reflected on the album, \\"[they] return with a well crafted release full of tight pop/rock sounds interspersed with the occasional country tinge rubbed off from the album's title... [Stewart's] vocals have a dry sweetness to them, add in new backup vocals, the odd pedal steel twang and the album is made.\\" They issued a four-track EP, Ruby's Gone, in the following year ‚Äì its title track was the lead track on their second album. Lee had mused, \\"From the storytelling opener 'Ruby's Gone' to the marvellous light rock of 'Bright Eyed Century', [the group] prove that they were worth all the hype they once got ‚Äì it's just a shame it never materialised into anything great.\\" In 2001 the group's third studio album, The Birds Album, appeared. They disbanded late in 2002.  Afterwards  Bek-Jean Stewart joined Perry Keyes' backing band, Give My Love to Rose, and provided drums and vocals for his albums, Meter (2005) and The Last Ghost Train Home (2007). Stewart's debut solo album, Junior Years, was issued in October 2007 and was declared Album of the Week by Radio National's Fran Kelly on her show, RN Breakfast. Former bandmates Matt Galvin on guitar and Grant Shanahan on bass guitar and as co- producer also appear on her album. Stewart's second album, Winter, Summer Suburban Exile, appeared in November 2010. Tess Morro of Soulshine noticed, \\"[her] voice is natural, soulful and throaty, with a sweeping range of emotional power... [and her] keen eye captures the friends and lovers who populate her songs from the inside as well as out, giving her work its dispassion and its humanity... [it] is a remarkable release from one of Australia‚Äôs most original singer-songwriters.\\" Shanahan also worked on Keyes' album, The Last Ghost Train Home, as co-producer. By June 2014 Shanahan had joined Keyes' backing band on bass guitar alongside Galvin on lead guitar.

It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Bolk√≥w and part of the Neisse-Nysa-Nisa Euroregion. Overview The town lies at the Nysa Szalona River, approximately south-west of Jawor, and west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. it is located within the historic region of Lower Silesia. As at 30 June 2010, it has a population of about 5,301. History Medieval Bolk√≥w Castle In the Middle Ages Bolk√≥w was a small settlement within the fragmented Polish Kingdom, it was first mentioned as Hain and granted town rights in 1276. The oldest known mention of the Bolk√≥w Castle dates back to 1277 and the reign of Polish Duke Boles≈Çaw II Rogatka. It was significantly expanded by his son, Duke Bolko I the Strict. During the reign of Bolko's successors, Bernard of ≈öwidnica and Bolko II the Small, the castle became one of the most powerful strongholds in Silesia and a treasury was also located in it. The town's current name was given by Duke Bernard of ≈öwidnica, under whose rule it developed rapidly, to commemorate his father Duke Bolko I the Strict. In 1345 it was successfully defended by Poles during a Czech siege. It remained part of the Piast-ruled Duchy of ≈öwidnica until its dissolution in 1392, when it was incorporated into the Czech Crown Lands of the multi-ethnic Holy Roman Empire. In 1463 the castle was captured by the Czech King George of Podƒõbrady and afterwards it became the home of local bandits, before being captured by the burghers of Wroc≈Çaw and ≈öwidnica in 1468. Afterwards the town passed to the Kingdom of Hungary, in 1493 it was captured by Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn of the Piast dynasty, and later it was came back under Czech rule. The town and castle, devastated in the Thirty Years' War, became a property of Krzesz√≥w Abbey in 1703. During the Silesian Wars, in the mid-18th century the town was annexed by Prussia and, subsequently, in 1871 became part of Germany. After secularization, from 1810 the castle was abandoned and slowly deteriorated. Restoration efforts of the castle did not begin until 1905. During World War II the Germans established a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp for Jews. A training camp for Jewish volunteers to Hagana was established in 1947 in Bolk√≥w. The camp trained 7000 soldiers who then traveled to Palestine and it existed until the end of 1948. Since 1997 the Bolk√≥w Castle is the site of the annual \\"Castle Party\\" Gothic rock festival. Sights The most notable landmark of the town is the medieval Bolk√≥w Castle, dating back to the 13th century. Other sights include the town hall, Church of Saint Hedwig, the Market Square filled with colourful townhouses, and other historic buildings and structures. 2165viki Zamek Bolk√≥w.

Despite Lobengula's retrospective attempts to disavow it, it proved the foundation for the royal charter granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes's British South Africa Company in October 1889, and thereafter for the Pioneer Column's occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, which marked the beginning of white settlement, administration and development in the country that eventually became Rhodesia, named after Rhodes, in 1895. Rhodes's pursuit of the exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the British Empire as part of his personal ambition for a Cape to Cairo Railway‚Äîwinning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a chartered company, empowered to annex and thereafter govern the Zambezi‚ÄìLimpopo watershed on Britain's behalf. He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and Matabele peoples and then sent Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital Bulawayo against Edward Arthur Maund, a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of izinDuna (tribal leaders). The concession conferred on the grantees the sole rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, as well as the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms;(only Rudd understood most of the terms ) he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful. After Rhodes and the London consortium agreed to pool their interests, Rhodes travelled to London, arriving in March 1889. His amalgamated charter bid gathered great political and popular support over the next few months, prompting the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, to approve the royal charter, which was formally granted in October 1889. The Company occupied and annexed Mashonaland about a year later. Attempting to set up a rival to the Rudd Concession, Lobengula granted similar rights to the German businessman Eduard Lippert in 1891, but Rhodes promptly acquired this concession as well. Company troops conquered Matabeleland during the First Matabele War of , and Lobengula died from smallpox in exile soon after. Background alt=A map. See description During the 1810s, the Zulu Kingdom was established in southern Africa by the warrior king Shaka, who united a number of rival clans into a centralised monarchy. Among the Zulu Kingdom's main leaders and military commanders was Mzilikazi, who enjoyed high royal favour for a time, but ultimately provoked the king's wrath by repeatedly offending him. When Shaka forced Mzilikazi and his followers to leave the country in 1823, they moved north-west to the Transvaal, where they became known as the Ndebele or \\"Matabele\\"‚Äîboth names mean \\"men of the long shields\\". Amid the period of war and chaos locally called mfecane (\\"the crushing\\"), the Matabele quickly became the region's dominant tribe. In 1836, they negotiated a peace treaty with Sir Benjamin d'Urban, Governor of the British Cape Colony, but the same year Boer Voortrekkers moved to the area, during their Great Trek away from British rule in the Cape. These new arrivals soon toppled Mzilikazi's domination of the Transvaal, compelling him to lead another migration north in 1838. Crossing the Limpopo River, the Matabele settled in the Zambezi‚ÄìLimpopo watershed's south-west; this area has since been called Matabeleland. Matabele culture mirrored that of the Zulus in many aspects. The Matabele language, Sindebele, was largely based on Zulu‚Äîand just like Zululand, Matabeleland had a strong martial tradition. Matabele men went through a Spartan upbringing, designed to produce disciplined warriors, and military organisation largely dictated the distribution of administrative responsibilities. The inkosi (king) appointed a number of izinDuna (or indunas), who acted as tribal leaders in both military and civilian matters. Like the Zulus, the Matabele referred to a regiment of warriors as an impi. The Mashona people, who had inhabited the north-east of the region for centuries, greatly outnumbered the Matabele, but were weaker militarily, and so to a large degree entered a state of tributary submission to them. Mzilikazi agreed to two treaties with the Transvaal Boers in 1853, first with Hendrik Potgieter (who died shortly before negotiations ended), then with Andries Pretorius; the first of these, which did not bear Mzilikazi's own mark, purported to make Matabeleland a virtual Transvaal protectorate, while the second, which was more properly enacted, comprised a more equal peace agreement. alt=A black-and-white image depicting a middle-aged African king. Though at first glance a tall, strong-looking man, the subject's condition appears to have deteriorated with age; his belly appears severely bloated. He wears an animal-skin loincloth and a necklace made from what appear to be the teeth of various creatures. He holds a long spear in his right hand, which rests on the ground. After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula replaced him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; according to the South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative‚Äî\\"every inch a king\\". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed by one of the whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation. For unclear reasons, Lobengula's attitude towards foreigners reversed sharply during the late 1870s. He discarded his Western clothes in favour of more traditional animal-skin garments, stopped supporting trading enterprises, and began to restrict the movement of whites into and around his country. However, the whites kept coming, particularly after the discovery in 1886 of gold deposits in the South African Republic (or Transvaal), which prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg. After rumours spread among the Witwatersrand (or Rand) prospectors of even richer tracts, \\"a second Rand\\", north of the Limpopo, the miners began to trek north to seek concessions from Lobengula that would allow them to search for gold in Matabeleland and Mashonaland. These efforts were mostly in vain. Apart from the Tati Concession, which covered a small strip of land on the border with the Bechuanaland Protectorate where miners had operated since 1868, mining operations in the watershed remained few and far between. The foremost business and political figure in southern Africa at this time was Cecil Rhodes, a vicar's son who had arrived from England in 1870, aged 17. Since entering the diamond trade at Kimberley in 1871, Rhodes had gained near- complete domination of the world diamond market with the help of Charles Rudd, Alfred Beit and other business associates, as well as the generous financial backing of Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Rhodes was also a member of the Cape Parliament, having been elected in 1881. Amid the European Scramble for Africa, he envisioned the annexation to the British Empire of territories that would connect the Cape, at Africa's southern tip, with Cairo, the Egyptian city at the northern end of the continent, and allow for the construction of a railway linking the two. This ambition was directly challenged in the south by the presence of the Boer republics and, just to the north of them, Lobengula's domains. The fact that the Zambezi‚ÄìLimpopo region did not fall into any of the \\"spheres of influence\\" defined at the Berlin Conference further complicated matters; the Transvaalers, Germans and Portuguese were all also showing interest in the area, much to the annoyance of both Lobengula and Rhodes. Prelude: the Moffat treaty alt=A man with brown hair and a moustache, sketched in profile Rhodes began advocating the annexation by Britain of Matabeleland and Mashonaland in 1887 by applying pressure to a number of senior colonial officials, most prominently the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Hercules Robinson, and Sidney Shippard, Britain's administrator in the Bechuanaland Crown colony (comprising that country's southern part). Shippard, an old friend of Rhodes, was soon won over to the idea, and in May 1887 the administrator wrote to Robinson strongly endorsing annexation of the territories, particularly Mashonaland, which he described as \\"beyond comparison the most valuable country south of the Zambezi\\". It was the Boers, however, who were first to achieve diplomatic successes with Lobengula. Pieter Grobler secured a treaty of \\"renewal of friendship\\" between Matabeleland and the South African Republic in July 1887. The same month, Robinson organised the appointment of John Smith Moffat, a locally born missionary, as assistant commissioner in Bechuanaland. Moffat, well-known to Lobengula, was given this position in the hope that he might make the king less cordial with the Boers and more pro-British. alt=A balding man with long sideburns, wearing a suit with a buttonhole carnation In September 1887, Robinson wrote to Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant concessions of any kind to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, but that it was a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more. In Pretoria, in early December, another British agent met Paul Kruger, the President of the South African Republic, who reportedly said that his government now regarded Matabeleland as under Transvaal \\"protection and sovereignty\\", and that one of the clauses of the Grobler treaty had been that Lobengula could not \\"grant any concessions or make any contact with anybody whatsoever\\" without Pretoria's approval. Meeting at Grahamstown on Christmas Day, Rhodes, Shippard and Robinson agreed to instruct Moffat to investigate the matter with Lobengula and to secure a copy of the Grobler treaty for further clarification, as well as to arrange a formal Anglo-Matabele treaty, which would have provisions included to prevent Lobengula from making any more agreements with foreign powers other than Britain. Lobengula was alarmed by how some were perceiving his dealings with Grobler, and so was reluctant to sign any more agreements with foreigners. Despite his familiarity with Moffat, the king did not consider him above suspicion, and he was dubious about placing himself firmly in the British camp; as Moffat said of the Matabele leadership in general, \\"they may like us better, but they fear the Boers more\\". Moffat's negotiations with the king and izinDuna were therefore very long and uneasy. The missionary presented the proposed British treaty as an offer to renew that enacted by d'Urban and Mzilikazi in 1836. He told the Matabele that the Boers were misleading them, that Pretoria's interpretation of the Grobler treaty differed greatly from their own, and that the British proposal served Matabele interests better in any case. On 11 February 1888, Lobengula agreed and placed his mark and seal at the foot of the agreement. The document proclaimed that the Matabele and British were now at peace, that Lobengula would not enter any kind of diplomatic correspondence with any country apart from Britain, and that the king would not \\"sell, alienate or cede\\" any part of Matabeleland or Mashonaland to anybody. alt=A dark-haired man with a huge beard, wearing a dark suit and a white shirt The document was unilateral in form, describing only what Lobengula would do to prevent any of these conditions being broken. Shippard was dubious about this and the fact that none of the izinDuna had signed the proclamation, and asked Robinson if it would be advisable to negotiate another treaty. Robinson replied in the negative, reasoning that reopening talks with Lobengula so soon would only make him suspicious. Britain's ministers at Whitehall perceived the unilateral character of the treaty as advantageous for Britain, as it did not commit Her Majesty's Government to any particular course of action. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister, ruled that Moffat's treaty trumped Grobler's, despite being signed at a later date, because the London Convention of 1884 precluded the South African Republic from making treaties with any state apart from the Orange Free State; treaties with \\"native tribes\\" north of the Limpopo were permitted, but the Prime Minister claimed that Matabeleland was too cohesively organised to be regarded as a mere tribe, and should instead be considered a nation. He concluded from this reasoning that the Grobler treaty was ultra vires and legally meaningless. Whitehall soon gave Robinson permission to ratify the Moffat agreement, which was announced to the public in Cape Town on 25 April 1888. For Rhodes, the agreement Moffat had made with Lobengula was crucial as it bought time that allowed him to devote the necessary attention to the final amalgamation of the South African diamond interests. A possible way out of the situation for Lobengula was to lead another Matabele migration across the Zambezi, but Rhodes hoped to keep the king where he was for the moment as a buffer against Boer expansion. In March 1888, Rhodes bought out the company of his last competitor, the circus showman turned diamond millionaire Barney Barnato, to form De Beers Consolidated Mines, a sprawling national monopoly that controlled 90% of world diamond production. Barnato wanted to limit De Beers to mining diamonds, but Rhodes insisted that he was going to use the company to \\"win the north\\": to this end, he ensured that the De Beers trust deed enabled activities far removed from mining, including banking and railway-building, the ability to annex and govern land, and the raising of armed forces. All this gave the immensely wealthy company powers not unlike those of the East India Company, which had governed India on Britain's behalf from 1757 to 1857. Through De Beers and Gold Fields of South Africa, the gold-mining firm he had recently started with Charles Rudd, Rhodes had both the capacity and the financial means to make his dream of an African empire a reality, but to make such ambitions practicable, he would first have to acquire a royal charter empowering him to take personal control of the relevant territories on Britain's behalf. To secure this royal charter, he would need to present Whitehall with a concession, signed by a native ruler, granting to Rhodes the exclusive mining rights in the lands he hoped to annex. Concession=Race to Bulawayo Lord Knutsford, the British Colonial Secretaryalt=A balding man with prominent sideburns, wearing a dark suit and white shirt. Rhodes faced competition for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and Lord Gifford, two London financiers. They appointed as their agent Edward Arthur Maund, who had served with Sir Charles Warren in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885, towards the end of this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with his own eyes. He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to Lord Knutsford, the British Colonial Secretary, seeking his approval for their designs. The urgency of negotiating a concession was made clear to Rhodes during a visit to London in June 1888, when he learned of the London syndicate's letter to Knutsford, and of their appointment of Maund. Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly. \\"Someone has to get the country, and I think we should have the best chance,\\" Rhodes told Rothschild; \\"I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king. He is the only block to central Africa, as, once we have his territory, the rest is easy ... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen ... I have faith in the country, and Africa is on the move. I think it is a second Cinderella.\\" alt=A portrait photograph of a bearded man in a plain hat and jacket Rhodes and Beit put Rudd at the head of their new negotiating team because of his extensive experience negotiating the purchase of Boers' farms for gold prospecting. Because Rudd knew little of indigenous African customs and languages, Rhodes added Francis \\"Matabele\\" Thompson, an employee of his who had for years run the reserves and compounds that housed the black labourers at the diamond fields. Thompson was fluent in Setswana, the language of the Tswana people to Lobengula's south-west, and therefore could communicate directly and articulately with the king, who also knew the language. James Rochfort Maguire, an Irish barrister Rhodes had known at Oxford, was recruited as a third member. Many analysts find the inclusion of the cultured, metropolitan Maguire puzzling‚Äîit is often suggested that he was brought along so he could couch the document in the elaborate legal language of the English bar, and thus make it unchallengeable, but as the historian John Semple Galbraith comments, the kind of agreement that was required was hardly complicated enough to merit the considerable expense and inconvenience of bringing Maguire along. In his biography of Rhodes, Robert I. Rotberg suggests that he may have intended Maguire to lend Rudd's expedition \\"a touch of culture and class\\", in the hope that this might impress Lobengula and rival would-be concessionaires. One of the advantages held by the London syndicate was the societal prestige of Gifford in particular, and Rhodes hoped to counter this through Maguire. Rudd's party ultimately comprised himself, Thompson, Maguire, J G Dreyer (their Dutch wagon driver), a fifth white man, a Cape Coloured, an African American and two black servants. Maund arrived in Cape Town in late June 1888 and attempted to gain Robinson's approval for the Cawston‚ÄìGifford bid. Robinson was reserved in his answers, saying that he supported the development of Matabeleland by a company with this kind of backing, but did not feel he could commit to endorsing Cawston and Gifford exclusively while there remained other potential concessionaires, most prominently Rhodes‚Äîcertainly not without unequivocal instructions from Whitehall. While Rudd's party gathered and prepared in Kimberley, Maund travelled north, and reached the diamond mines at the start of July. On 14 July, in Bulawayo, agents representing a consortium headed by the South African-based entrepreneur Thomas Leask received a mining concession from Lobengula, covering all of his country, and pledging half of the proceeds to the king. When he learned of this latter condition Leask was distraught, saying the concession was \\"commercially valueless\\". Moffat pointed out to Leask that his group did not have the resources to act on the concession anyway, and that both Rhodes and the London syndicate did; at Moffat's suggestion, Leask decided to wait and sell his concession to whichever big business group gained a new agreement from Lobengula. Neither Rhodes's group, the Cawston‚ÄìGifford consortium nor the British colonial officials immediately learned of the Leask concession. In early July 1888, Rhodes returned from London and met with Robinson, proposing the establishment of a chartered company to govern and develop south-central Africa, with himself at its head, and similar powers to the British North Borneo, Imperial British East Africa and Royal Niger Companies. Rhodes said that this company would take control of those parts of Matabeleland and Mashonaland \\"not in use\\" by the local people, demarcate reserved areas for the indigenous population, and thereafter defend both, while developing the lands not reserved for natives. In this way, he concluded, Matabele and Mashona interests would be protected, and south- central Africa would be developed, all without a penny from Her Majesty's Treasury. Robinson wrote to Knutsford on 21 July that he thought Whitehall should back this idea; he surmised that the Boers would receive British expansion into the Zambezi‚ÄìLimpopo watershed better if it came in the form of a chartered company than if it occurred with the creation of a new Crown colony. He furthermore wrote a letter for Rudd's party to carry to Bulawayo, recommending Rudd and his companions to Lobengula. A Matabele kraal, as depicted by alt=A peaceful pre-colonial southern African scene. Beneath a blue sky, a large kraal is seen from afar, with black figures dotted around it. Maund left Kimberley in July, well ahead of the Rudd party. Rudd's negotiating team, armed with Robinson's endorsement, was still far from ready‚Äîthey left Kimberley only on 15 August‚Äîbut Moffat, travelling from Shoshong in Bechuanaland, was ahead of both expeditions. He reached Bulawayo in late August to find the kraal filled with white concession-hunters. The various bidders attempted to woo the king with a series of gifts and favours, but won little to show for it. Between Kimberley and Mafeking, Maund learned from Shippard that Grobler had been killed by a group of Ngwato warriors while returning to the Transvaal, and that the Boers were threatening to attack the British-protected Ngwato chief, Khama III, in response. Maund volunteered to help defend Khama, writing a letter to his employers explaining that doing so might lay the foundations for a concession from Khama covering territory that the Matabele and Ngwato disputed. Cawston tersely wrote back with orders to make for Bulawayo without delay, but over a month had passed in the time this written exchange required, and Maund had squandered his head start on Rudd. After ignoring a notice Lobengula had posted at Tati, barring entry to white big-game hunters and concession-seekers, the Rudd party arrived at the king's kraal on 21 September 1888, three weeks ahead of Maund. Negotiations Rudd, Thompson and Maguire immediately went to present themselves to Lobengula, who came out from his private quarters without hesitation and politely greeted the visitors. Through a Sindebele interpreter, Rudd introduced himself and the others, explained on whose behalf they acted, said they had come for an amiable sojourn, and presented the king with a gift of ¬£100. After the subject of business was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi‚ÄìLimpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue easier for him to manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him not to make a decision until after this was over. Accompanied by Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams and 16 policemen, Shippard arrived in mid-October 1888. The king suspended concession negotiations in favour of meetings with him. The colonial official told the king that the Boers were hungry for more land and intended to overrun his country before too long; he also championed Rudd's cause, telling Lobengula that Rudd's team acted on behalf of a powerful, financially formidable organisation supported by Queen Victoria. Meanwhile, Rhodes sent a number of letters to Rudd, warning him that Maund was his main rival, and that because the London syndicate's goals overlapped so closely with their own, it was essential that Cawston and Gifford be defeated or else brought into the Rhodes camp. Regarding Lobengula, Rhodes advised Rudd to make the king think that the concession would work for him. \\"Offer a steamboat on the Zambezi same as [Henry Morton] Stanley put on the Upper Congo ... Stick to Home Rule and Matabeleland for the Matabele[,] I am sure it is the ticket.\\" As October passed without major headway, Rudd grew anxious to return to the Witswatersrand gold mines, but Rhodes insisted that he could not leave Bulawayo without the concession. \\"You must not leave a vacuum,\\" Rhodes instructed. \\"Leave Thompson and Maguire if necessary or wait until I can join ... if we get anything we must always have someone resident\\". Thus prevented from leaving, Rudd vigorously tried to persuade Lobengula to enter direct negotiations with him over a concession, but was repeatedly rebuffed. The king only agreed to look at the draft document, mostly written by Rudd, just before Shippard was due to leave in late October. At this meeting, Lobengula discussed the terms with Rudd for over an hour. Charles Helm, a missionary based in the vicinity, was summoned by the king to act as an interpreter. According to Helm, Rudd made a number of oral promises to Lobengula that were not in the written document, including \\"that they would not bring more than 10 white men to work in his country, that they would not dig anywhere near towns, etc., and that they and their people would abide by the laws of his country and in fact be his people.\\" After these talks with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna to present the proposed concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It soon became clear that opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, but there was also a case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour. alt=Two breech-loading rifles of late 19th-century vintage For many at the indaba, the most pressing motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged to protect him from incursions by the Boers. Rudd was offering generous terms that few competitors could hope to even come close to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini‚ÄìHenry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of ¬£500), and ¬£100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he had at the time between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless. The final round of negotiations started at the royal kraal on the morning of 30 October. The talks took place at an indaba between the izinDuna and Rudd's party; the king himself did not attend, but was nearby. The izinDuna pressed Rudd and his companions as to where exactly they planned to mine, to which they replied that they wanted rights covering \\"the whole country\\". When the izinDuna demurred, Thompson insisted, \\"No, we must have Mashonaland, and right up to the Zambezi as well‚Äîin fact, the whole country\\". According to Thompson's account, this provoked confusion among the izinDuna, who did not seem to know where these places were. \\"The Zambezi must be there\\", said one, incorrectly pointing south (rather than north). The Matabele representatives then prolonged the talks through \\"procrastination and displays of geographical ignorance\\", in the phrase of the historian Arthur Keppel-Jones, until Rudd and Thompson announced that they were done talking and rose to leave. The izinDuna were somewhat alarmed by this and asked the visitors to please stay and continue, which they did. It was then agreed that inDuna Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day's progress to the king. Agreement After speaking with Lotshe and Thompson, the king was still hesitant to make a decision. Thompson appealed to Lobengula with a rhetorical question: \\"Who gives a man an assegai [spear] if he expects to be attacked by him afterwards?\\" Seeing the allusion to the offered Martini‚ÄìHenry rifles, Lobengula was swayed by this logic, and made up his mind to grant the concession. \\"Bring me the fly-blown paper and I will sign it,\\" he said. Thompson briefly left the room to call Rudd, Maguire, Helm and Dreyer in, and they sat in a semi-circle around the king. Lobengula then put his mark to the concession, which read: As Lobengula inscribed his mark at the foot of the paper, Maguire turned to Thompson and said \\"Thompson, this is the epoch of our lives.\\" Once Rudd, Maguire and Thompson had signed the concession, Helm and Dreyer added their signatures as witnesses, and Helm wrote an endorsement beside the terms: Lobengula refused to allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's interpretation was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so did not think it necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own. Validity dispute=Announcement and reception Within hours, Rudd and Dreyer were hurrying south to present the document to Rhodes, travelling by mule cart, the fastest mode of transport available. Thompson and Maguire stayed in Bulawayo to defend the concession against potential challenges. Rudd reached Kimberley and Rhodes on 19 November 1888, a mere 20 days after the document's signing, and commented with great satisfaction that this marked a record that would surely not be broken until the railway was laid into the interior. Rhodes was elated by Rudd's results, describing the concession as \\"so gigantic it is like giving a man the whole of Australia\\". Both in high spirits, the pair travelled to Cape Town by train, and presented themselves to Robinson on 21 November. Robinson was pleased to learn of Rudd's success. The High Commissioner wanted to gazette the concession immediately, but Rhodes knew that the promise to arm Lobengula with 1,000 Martini‚ÄìHenrys would be received with apprehension elsewhere in South Africa, especially among Boers; he suggested that this aspect of the concession should be kept quiet until the guns were already in Bechuanaland. Rudd therefore prepared a version of the document omitting mention of the Martini‚ÄìHenrys, which was approved by Rhodes and Robinson, and published in the Cape Times and Cape Argus newspapers on 24 November 1888. The altered version described the agreed price for the Zambezi‚ÄìLimpopo mining monopoly as \\"the valuable consideration of a large monthly payment in cash, a gunboat for defensive purposes on the Zambesi, and other services.\\" Two days later, the Cape Times printed a notice from Lobengula: But the king was already beginning to receive reports telling him that he had been hoodwinked into \\"selling his country\\". Word abounded in Bulawayo that with the Rudd Concession (as the document became called), Lobengula had signed away far more impressive rights than he had thought. Some of the Matabele began to question the king's judgement. While the izinDuna looked on anxiously, Moffat questioned whether Lobengula would be able to keep control. Thompson was summoned by the izinDuna and interrogated for over 10 hours before being released; according to Thompson, they were \\"prepared to suspect even the king himself\\". Rumours spread among the kraal's white residents of a freebooter force in the South African Republic that allegedly intended to invade and support Gambo, a prominent inDuna, in overthrowing and killing Lobengula. Horrified by these developments, Lobengula attempted to secure his position by deflecting blame. InDuna Lotshe, who had supported granting the concession, was condemned for having misled his king and executed, along with his extended family and followers‚Äîover 300 men, women and children in all.; Meanwhile, Rhodes and Rudd returned to Kimberley, and Robinson wrote to the Colonial Office at Whitehall on 5 December 1888 to inform them of Rudd's concession. Lobengula's embassy alt=Queen Victoria in characteristic regalia. While reassuring Thompson and Maguire that he was only repudiating the idea that he had given his country away, and not the concession itself (which he told them would be respected), Lobengula asked Maund to accompany two of his izinDuna, Babayane and Mshete, to England, so they could meet Queen Victoria herself, officially to present to her a letter bemoaning Portuguese incursions on eastern Mashonaland, but also unofficially to seek counsel regarding the crisis at Bulawayo. The mission was furthermore motivated by the simple desire of Lobengula and his izinDuna to see if this white queen, whose name the British swore by, really existed. The king's letter concluded with a request for the Queen to send a representative of her own to Bulawayo. Maund, who saw a second chance to secure his own concession, perhaps even at Rudd's expense, said he was more than happy to assist, but Lobengula remained cautious with him: when Maund raised the subject of a new concession covering the Mazoe valley, the king replied \\"Take my men to England for me; and when you return, then I will talk about that.\\" Johannes Colenbrander, a frontiersman from Natal, was recruited to accompany the Matabele emissaries as an interpreter. They left in mid-December 1888. Around this time, a group of Austral Africa Company prospectors, led by Alfred Haggard, approached Lobengula's south-western border, hoping to gain their own Matabeleland mining concession; on learning of this, the king honoured one of the terms of the Rudd Concession by allowing Maguire to go at the head of a Matabele impi to turn Haggard away. While Robinson's letter to Knutsford made its way to England by sea, the Colonial Secretary learned of the Rudd Concession from Cawston and Gifford. Knutsford wired Robinson on 17 December to ask if there was any truth in what the London syndicate had told him about the agreed transfer of 1,000 Martini‚ÄìHenrys: \\"If rifles part of consideration, as reported, do you think there will be danger of complications arising from this?\\" Robinson replied, again in writing; he enclosed a minute from Shippard in which the Bechuanaland official explained how the concession had come about, and expressed the view that the Matabele were less experienced with rifles than with assegais, so their receipt of such weapons did not in itself make them lethally dangerous. He then argued that it would not be diplomatic to give Khama and other chiefs firearms while withholding them from Lobengula, and that a suitably armed Matabeleland might act as a deterrent against Boer interference. Surprised by the news of a Matabele mission to London, Rhodes attempted to publicly downplay the credentials of the izinDuna and to stop them from leaving Africa. When the envoys reached Kimberley Rhodes told his close friend, associate and housemate Dr Leander Starr Jameson‚Äîwho himself held the rank of inDuna, having been so honoured by Lobengula years before as thanks for medical treatment‚Äîto invite Maund to their cottage. Maund was suspicious, but came anyway. At the cottage, Rhodes offered Maund financial and professional incentives to defect from the London syndicate. Maund refused, prompting Rhodes to declare furiously that he would have Robinson stop his progress at Cape Town. The izinDuna reached Cape Town in mid-January 1889 to find that it was as Rhodes had said; to delay their departure, Robinson discredited them, Maund and Colenbrander in cables to the Colonial Office in London, saying that Shippard had described Maund as \\"mendacious\\" and \\"dangerous\\", Colenbrander as \\"hopelessly unreliable\\", and Babayane and Mshete as not actually izinDuna or even headmen. Cawston forlornly telegraphed Maund that it was pointless to try to go on while Robinson continued in this vein. Rhodes and the London syndicate join forces Rhodes then arrived in Cape Town to talk again with Maund. His mood was markedly different: after looking over Lobengula's message to Queen Victoria, he said that he believed the Matabele expedition to England could actually buttress the concession and associated development plans if the London syndicate would agree to merge its interests with his own and form an amalgamated company alongside him. He told Maund to wire this pitch to his employers. Maund presumed that Rhodes's shift in attitude had come about because of his own influence, coupled with the threat to Rhodes's concession posed by the Matabele mission, but in fact the idea for uniting the two rival bids had come from Knutsford, who the previous month had suggested to Cawston and Gifford that they were likelier to gain a royal charter covering south-central Africa if they joined forces with Rhodes. They had wired Rhodes, who had in turn come back to Maund. The unification, which extricated Rhodes and his London rivals from their long-standing stalemate, was happily received by both sides; Cawston and Gifford could now tap Rhodes's considerable financial and political resources, and Rhodes's Rudd Concession had greater value now the London consortium no longer challenged it. There still remained the question of Leask's concession, the existence of which Rudd's negotiating team had learned in Bulawayo towards the end of October. Rhodes resolved that it must be acquired: \\"I quite see that worthless as [Leask's] concession is, it logically destroys yours,\\" he told Rudd. This loose end was tied up in late January 1889, when Rhodes met and settled with Leask and his associates, James Fairbairn and George Phillips, in Johannesburg. Leask was given ¬£2,000 in cash and a 10% interest in the Rudd Concession, and allowed to retain a 10% share in his own agreement with Lobengula. Fairbairn and Phillips were granted an annual allowance of ¬£300 each. In Cape Town, with Rhodes's opposition removed, Robinson altered his stance regarding the Matabele mission, cabling Whitehall that further investigation had shown Babayane and Mshete to be headmen after all, so they should be allowed to board ship for England. Lobengula's enquiry Meanwhile, in Bulawayo, South African newspaper reports of the concession started to arrive in the middle of January 1889. William Tainton, one of the local white residents, translated a press cutting for Lobengula, adding a few embellishments of his own: he told the king that he had sold his country, that the grantees could dig for minerals anywhere they liked, including in and around kraals, and that they could bring an army into Matabeleland to depose Lobengula in favour of a new chief. The king told Helm to read back and translate the copy of the concession that had remained in Bulawayo; Helm did so, and pointed out that none of the allegations Tainton had made were actually reflected in the text. Lobengula then said he wished to dictate an announcement. After Helm refused, Tainton translated and transcribed the king's words: This notice was published in the Bechuanaland News and Malmani Chronicle on 2 February 1889. A grand indaba of the izinDuna and the whites of Bulawayo was soon convened, but because Helm and Thompson were not present, the start of the investigation was delayed until 11 March. As in the negotiations with Rudd and Thompson in October, Lobengula did not himself attend, remaining close by but not interfering. The izinDuna questioned Helm and Thompson at great length, and various white men gave their opinions on the concession. A group of missionaries acted as mediators. Condemnation of the concession was led not by the izinDuna, but by the other whites, particularly Tainton. Tainton and the other white opponents of the concession contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed's minerals, lands, wood and water, and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country. Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of \\"full power to do all things that they may deem necessary to win and procure\\" the mining yield. William Mzisi, a Fengu from the Cape, who had been to the diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: \\"You say you do not want any land, how can you dig for gold without it, is it not in the land?\\" Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country. Helm was painted as a suspicious figure by some of the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was compounded by the fact that Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success. Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire received a number of threats and had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena. Rhodes sent the first shipments of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr Frederick Rutherfoord Harris and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo. Lobengula had so far accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued to do so for years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, and then went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen‚Äîhe said he had never intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document. Babayane and Mshete in England alt=A red castle with battlements and towers lies in the distance of the photograph. A path curves from the bottom of the picture towards it, with various people strolling along it. On either side is flat grass and green woodlands. Following their long delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and travelled by train to London, where they checked into the Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter‚ÄîMaund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject‚Äîbut Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary said that it would be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality. The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, as well as an oral message they had been told to pass on. The izinDuna stayed in London throughout the month of March, attending a number of dinners in their honour, including one hosted by the Aborigines' Protection Society. The Society sent a letter to Lobengula, advising him to be \\"wary and firm in resisting proposals that will not bring good to you and your people\\". The diplomats saw many of the British capital's sights, including London Zoo, the Alhambra Theatre and the Bank of England. Their hosts showed them the spear of the Zulu king Cetshwayo, which now hung on a wall at Windsor Castle, and took them to Aldershot to observe military manoeuvres conducted by Major-General Evelyn Wood, the man who had given this spear to the Queen after routing the Zulus in 1879. Knutsford held two more meetings with the izinDuna, and during the second of these gave them the Queen's reply to Lobengula's letter, which mostly comprised vague assurances of goodwill. Satisfied with this, the emissaries sailed for home. Rhodes wins the royal charter In late March 1889, just as the izinDuna were about to leave London, Rhodes arrived to make the amalgamation with Cawston and Gifford official. To the amalgamators' dismay, the Colonial Office had received protests against the Rudd Concession from a number of London businessmen and humanitarian societies, and had resolved that it could not sanction the concession because of its equivocal nature, as well as the fact that Lobengula had announced its suspension. Rhodes was originally angry with Maund, accusing him of responsibility for this, but eventually accepted that it was not Maund's fault. Rhodes told Maund to go back to Bulawayo, to pose as an impartial adviser, and to try to sway the king back in favour of the concession; as an added contingency, he told Maund to secure as many new subconcessions as he could. In London, as the amalgamation was formalised, Rhodes and Cawston sought public members to sit on the board of their prospective chartered company. They recruited the Duke of Abercorn, an affluent Irish peer and landowner with estates in Donegal and Scotland, to chair the firm, and the Earl of Fife‚Äîsoon to become the Duke of Fife, following his marriage to the daughter of the Prince of Wales‚Äîto act as his deputy. The third and final public member added to the board was the nephew and heir apparent of the erstwhile Cabinet minister Earl Grey, Albert Grey, who was a staunch imperialist, already associated with southern Africa. Attempting to ingratiate himself with Lord Salisbury, Rhodes then gave the position of standing counsel in the proposed company to the Prime Minister's son, Lord Robert Cecil. Horace Farquhar, a prominent London financier and friend of the Prince of Wales, was added to the board at Fife's suggestion later in the year. Rhodes spent the next few months in London, seeking out supporters for his cause in the West End, the City and, occasionally, the rural estates of the landed gentry. These efforts yielded the public backing of the prominent imperialist Harry Johnston, Alexander Livingstone Bruce (who sat on the board of the East Africa Company), and Lord Balfour of Burleigh, among others. Along with Grey's active involvement and Lord Salisbury's continuing favour, the weight of this opinion seemed to be reaping dividends for Rhodes by June 1889. The amalgamation with the London syndicate was complete, and Whitehall appeared to have dropped its reservations regarding the Rudd Concession's validity. Opposition to the charter in parliament and elsewhere had been for the most part silenced, and, with the help of Rhodes's press contacts, prominently William Thomas Stead, editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, opinion in the media was starting to back the idea of a chartered company for south-central Africa. But in June 1889, just as the Colonial Office looked poised to grant the royal charter, Lobengula's letter repudiating the Rudd Concession, written two months previously, arrived in London. Maguire, in London, promptly wrote to the Colonial Office, casting doubt on the letter's character on the grounds that it lacked the witnessing signature of an unbiased missionary. He concurrently wrote to Thompson, who was still in Bulawayo, to ask if there was any sign that the king had been misled during the repudiation letter's drafting. Around the same time, Robinson's strident attacks on parliamentary opponents of the Rudd Concession led to Lord Salisbury replacing him with Sir Henry Brougham Loch. Rhodes claimed not to be worried, telling Shippard in a letter that \\"the policy will not be altered\\". Indeed, by the end of June 1889, despite the removal of Robinson and the sensation caused by Lobengula's letter rejecting the concession, Rhodes had got his way: Lord Salisbury's concerns of Portuguese and German expansionism in Africa, coupled with Rhodes's personal exertions in London, prompted the Prime Minister to approve the granting of a royal charter. Rhodes returned victorious to the Cape in August 1889, while back in London Cawston oversaw the final preparations for the chartered company's establishment. alt=A Union Jack, emblazoned in the centre with an emblem depicting a lion holding an elephant tusk above the letters \\"BSAC\\" \\"My part is done,\\" Rhodes wrote to Maund, soon after reaching Cape Town; \\"the charter is granted supporting Rudd Concession and granting us the interior ... We have the whole thing recognised by the Queen and even if eventually we had any difficulty with king [Lobengula] the Home people would now always recognise us in possession of the minerals[;] they quite understand that savage potentates frequently repudiate.\\" A few weeks later, he wrote to Maund again: with the royal charter in place, \\"whatever [Lobengula] does now will not affect the fact that when there is a white occupation of the country our concession will come into force provided the English and not Boers get the country\\". On 29 October 1889, nearly a year to the day after the signing of the Rudd Concession, Rhodes's chartered company, the British South Africa Company, was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria. The concession's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and, by extension, the British Crown, making it practically unassailable.

Meanwhile, the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo, as Lobengula had requested; much to the king's indignation, it was Moffat. Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt and that he would just have to accept it. Lobengula rued the situation to Helm: \\"Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then another. At last, when well within reach, he darts out his tongue and the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and I am that fly.\\" The charter incorporating the British South Africa Company committed it to remaining \\"British in character and domicile\\", and defined its area of operations extremely vaguely, mentioning only that it was empowered to operate north of Bechuanaland and the Transvaal, and west of Mozambique. Northern and western bounds were not indicated. This was done deliberately to allow Rhodes to acquire as much land as he could without interference. The Company was made responsible for the safeguarding of peace and law in its territory, and licensed to do so \\"in such ways and manners as it shall consider necessary\\". It was vested with the power to raise its own police force, and charged with, among other things, abolishing slavery in all of its territories and restricting the sale of liquor to indigenous Africans. Local traditions were to be respected. The Company's charter was otherwise made extremely equivocal with the intention that this would allow it to operate freely and independently, and to govern and develop its acquired territories while also turning a profit. Rhodes capitalised the Company at ¬£1,000,000, split into ¬£1 shares, and used his other business interests to pump capital into it. Rhodes's diamond concern, De Beers, invested more than ¬£200,000, while his gold firm, Gold Fields, put in nearly ¬£100,000. He himself put in ¬£45,000, along with another ¬£11,000 jointly with Beit. Overall, about half of the Chartered Company's capital was held by its main actors, particularly Rhodes, Beit, Rudd and their confederates. During the Company's early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions over the coming years through what Robert Blake describes as a \\"suppressio veri ... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes's least creditable actions\\". Contrary to what Whitehall and the public had been allowed to think, the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company, but in a short-lived ancillary concern of Rhodes, Rudd and others called the Central Search Association, which was quietly formed in London in 1889. This entity renamed itself the United Concessions Company in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised Knutsford to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken. Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890 on the back of widespread support among Cape Afrikaners. He announced that his first objective as premier was the occupation of the Zambezi‚ÄìLimpopo watershed. His Chartered Company had by this time raised the Pioneer Column, a few hundred volunteers referred to as \\"pioneers\\" whose lot was to both occupy Mashonaland and begin its development. To this end its ranks were filled with men from all corners of southern African society, including, at Rhodes's insistence, several sons of the Cape's leading families. Each pioneer was promised of land and 15 mining claims in return for his service. Lobengula impassively acquiesced to the expedition at the behest of his friend Jameson, much to the fury of many of the izinDuna, who saw the column's march to Mashonaland as an appropriation of Matabele territory. Led by Major Frank Johnson and the famed hunter Frederick Courteney Selous, and escorted by 500 British South Africa Company's Police under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Pennefather, the pioneers skirted their way around Lobengula's heartlands, heading north-east from Bechuanaland and then north, and founded Fort Tuli, Fort Victoria and Fort Charter along the way. They stopped at the site of the future capital, Fort Salisbury (named after the Prime Minister), on 12 September 1890, and ceremonially raised the Union Jack the next morning. The administration of Mashonaland did not immediately prove profitable for the Company or its investors, partly because of the costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers. Lippert concession Edward Renny-Tailyour, representing the Hamburg businessman Eduard Lippert‚Äîan estranged cousin of Beit‚Äîhad been attempting to gain a concession from Lobengula since early 1888. Rhodes saw Lippert's activities as unwelcome meddling and so repeatedly tried (and failed) to settle with him. In April 1891, Renny-Tailyour grandly announced that he and Lobengula had made an agreement: in return for ¬£1,000 up front and ¬£500 annually, the king would bestow on Lippert the exclusive rights to manage lands, establish banks, mint money, and conduct trade in the territory of the Chartered Company. The authenticity of this document was disputed, largely because the only witnesses to have signed it, apart from inDuna Mshete, were Renny-Tailyour's associates, one of whom soon attested that Lobengula had believed himself to be granting a concession to Theophilus Shepstone's son, \\"Offy\\" Shepstone, with Lippert merely acting as an agent. The Lippert concession therefore had a number of potential defects, but Lippert was still confident he could extract a princely fee for it from the Chartered Company; he named his price as ¬£250,000 in cash or shares at par. Rhodes, backed by Loch, initially condemned the Lippert concession as a fraud and branded Lippert's locally based agents enemies of the peace. Loch assured Rhodes that if Lippert tried to gazette his agreement, he would issue a proclamation warning of its infringement on the Rudd Concession and the Company's charter, and threaten Lippert's associates with legal action. The Colonial Office agreed with Loch. Rhodes initially said that he would not pay Lippert's price, which he described as blackmail, but after conferring with Beit decided that refusing to buy out Lippert might lead to drawn-out and similarly expensive court proceedings, which they could not be sure of winning. Rhodes told Beit to start bargaining. Lippert's agreement turned out to be an unexpected blessing for Rhodes in that it included a concession on land rights from Lobengula, which the Chartered Company itself lacked, and needed if it were to be recognised by Whitehall as legally owning the occupied territory in Mashonaland. After two months and a number of breakdowns in talks, Rudd took over the negotiations. He and Lippert agreed on 12 September 1891 that the Company would take over the concession from Lippert on the condition that he returned to Bulawayo and had it more properly formalised by Lobengula; in return the Company would grant the German of his choice in Matabeleland (with full land and mineral rights), 30,000 shares in the Chartered Company and other financial incentives. The success of this plan hinged on Lobengula continuing to believe that Lippert was acting against Rhodes rather than on his behalf. The religious Moffat was deeply troubled by what he called the \\"palpable immorality\\" of this deceit, but agreed not to interfere, deciding that Lobengula was just as untrustworthy as Lippert. With Moffat looking on as a witness, Lippert delivered his side of the deal in November 1891, extracting from the Matabele king the exclusive land rights for a century in the Chartered Company's operative territories, including permission to lay out farms and towns and to levy rents, in place of what had been agreed in April. As arranged, Lippert sold these rights to the Company, whereupon Loch approved the concession, expressing contentment at the solving of the Company's land rights problem; in an internal Whitehall memorandum, the Colonial Office affably remarked how expediently that administrative obstacle had been removed. The Matabele remained unaware of this subterfuge until May 1892. Conquest of Matabeleland: the end of Lobengula At the alt=A southern African colonial battle scene. A small number of white soldiers wearing slouch hats use the crates on their wagons as cover and shoot at an apparently vast number of black warriors. Lobengula's weakened Matabele kingdom uneasily coexisted with Rhodes's Company settlements in Mashonaland and north of the Zambezi for about another year. The king was angered by the lack of respect he perceived Company officials to have towards his authority, their insistence that his kingdom was separated from Company territory by a line between the Shashe and Hunyani Rivers, and their demands that he stop the traditional raids on Mashona villages by Matabele impis. After Matabele warriors began slaughtering Mashonas near Fort Victoria in July 1893, Jameson, who Rhodes had appointed Company administrator in Mashonaland, unsuccessfully tried to stop the violence through an indaba. Lobengula complained that the Chartered Company had \\"come not only to dig the gold but to rob me of my people and country as well\\". Monitoring events from Cape Town, Rhodes gauged Jameson's readiness for war by telegraph: \\"Read Luke 14:31\\". Jameson wired back: \\"All right. Have read Luke 14:31\\". On 13 August 1893, Lobengula refused to accept the stipend due him under the terms of the Rudd Concession, saying \\"it is the price of my blood\\". The next day, Jameson signed a secret agreement with settlers at Fort Victoria, promising each man of farm land, 20 gold claims and a share of Lobengula's cattle in return for service in a war against Matabeleland. Lobengula wrote again to Queen Victoria, and tried to send Mshete to England again at the head of another embassy, but Loch detained the izinDuna at Cape Town for a few days, then sent them home. Following a few minor skirmishes, the First Matabele War started in earnest in October: Company troops moved on Lobengula, using the inexorable firepower of their Maxim machine guns to crush attacks by the far larger Matabele army. On 3 November, with the whites nearing Bulawayo, Lobengula torched the town and fled; the settlers began rebuilding atop the ruins the next day. Jameson sent troops north from Bulawayo to bring the king back, but this column ceased its pursuit in early December after the remnants of Lobengula's army ambushed and annihilated 34 troopers who were sent across the Shangani River ahead of the main force. Lobengula had escaped the Company, but he lived only another two months before dying from smallpox in the north of the country on 22 or 23 January 1894. Matabeleland was conquered. The Matabele izinDuna unanimously accepted peace with the Company at an indaba in late February 1894. Rhodes subsequently funded education for three of Lobengula's sons. The name applied to the Company's domain by many of its early settlers, \\"Rhodesia\\", was made official by the Company in May 1895, and by Britain in 1898. The lands south of the Zambezi were designated \\"Southern Rhodesia\\", while those to the north were divided into North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia, which merged to form Northern Rhodesia in 1911. During three decades under Company rule, railways, telegraph wires and roads were laid across the territories' previously bare landscape with great vigour, and, with the immigration of tens of thousands of white colonists, prominent mining and tobacco farming industries were created, albeit partly at the expense of the black population's traditional ways of life, which were varyingly disrupted by the introduction of Western-style infrastructure, government, religion and economics. Southern Rhodesia, which attracted most of the settlers and investment, was turning a profit by 1912; Northern Rhodesia, by contrast, annually lost the Company millions right up to the 1920s. Following the results of the government referendum of 1922, Southern Rhodesia received responsible government from Britain at the termination of the Company's charter in 1923, and became a self-governing colony. Northern Rhodesia became a directly administered British protectorate the following year.

Early life  He was the son of Henry Rudd (1809-1884), who had a shipbuilding business in London, and his first wife Mary Stanbridge. Rudd studied at Harrow School (1857‚Äì1862) and then entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1863, where he excelled in playing rackets. He left for Cape Colony in 1865 before completing his degree, according to himself under medical advice. There he hunted with the likes of John Dunn and endeavored in various business enterprises. In the early 1870s, he worked for his brother Thomas' (1831‚Äì1902) Port Elizabeth-based trading firm.  Partnership with Cecil Rhodes  In 1872/3 Rudd and Rhodes became friends and partners, working diamond claims in Kimberley, dealing in diamonds and operating pumping and ice-making machinery, amongst many other odds and ends. Between 1873 and 1881, while Rhodes intermittently attended college in England, Rudd managed their interests. By 1880 they had become rich and, with others, formed the De Beers Mining Company. Rudd was one of the directors and also held large interests in the main machinery supplier for the mining fields.  The Rudd Concession  In 1887 Rudd's interests had shifted to gold, the previous year discovered at the Witwatersrand. With Rhodes and him as directors, and his brother Thomas as chairman, they registered Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd in early 1887. The company was structured to enormously favor Rudd and Rhodes, with its London board unaware of most of their activities in southern Africa. On 30 October 1888 Rudd secured an agreement to the mineral rights of Matabeleland and Mashonaland from Lobengula the King of Matabeleland. The agreement became known as the Rudd Concession. Matabeleland and Mashonaland form the bulk of what is now known as Zimbabwe. Rhodes and Rudd had duped the British government and the investing public into believing that the concession was vested in the public company and made millions of pounds when the British South Africa Company bought the concession. Rudd had disagreements with Rhodes, in 1895 proclaiming that he would no longer work with Rhodes, and perhaps was unaware of the Gold Fields' conspiracy which culminated in the disastrous Jameson raid. Still, Rudd remained a friend of Rhodes and a director of Gold Fields until 1902, after which he retired to Scotland, \\"enjoying the life of an Edwardian plutocrat\\". In 1896, he bought the Ardnamurchan estate in Argyll, where he built two \\"houses\\", one of which, Glenborrodale Castle, just for his guests. He died in 1916 after an unsuccessful prostate operation in a nursing home in London.  Family  In the late 1860s in South Africa, Rudd married his first wife, Frances Georgina \\"Fanny\\" Leighton Chiappini (born 1846). Rudd and Fanny had a daughter, Evelyn, and three sons: Henry Percy, known as Percy; Franklyn Martin; and Charles John Lockhart, known as Jack. Percy‚Äôs son, Bevil Rudd was an Olympic champion 400 metre runner.Records of the Rudd Family, page 213: Rudd of Hartley, Westmorland family tree. Frances died in 1896 of influenza or tuberculosis, and in 1898 Rudd married 24-year old Corrie Maria Wallace, the daughter of his partner in the machinery company in Kimberley, with whom he had three more children.

The friction generated by the relative motion of the two surfaces that press against each other is a source of energy dissipation. In general, damping is the dissipation of energy from a vibrating system where the kinetic energy is converted into heat by the friction. Coulomb damping is a common damping mechanism that occurs in machinery. History Coulomb damping was so named because Charles-Augustin de Coulomb carried on research in mechanics. He later published a work on friction in 1781 entitled \\"Theory of Simple Machines\\" for an Academy of Sciences contest. Coulomb then gained much fame for his work with electricity and magnetism. Modes of Coulomb damping Coulomb damping absorbs energy with friction, which converts that kinetic energy into thermal energy or heat. The Coulomb friction law is associated with two aspects. Static and kinetic frictions occur in a vibrating system undergoing Coulomb damping. Static friction occurs when the two objects are stationary or undergoing no relative motion. For static friction, the friction force exerted between the surfaces having no relative motion cannot exceed a value that is proportional to the product of the normal force and the coefficient of static friction : :F_s = \\\\mu_s N. Kinetic friction occurs when the two objects are undergoing relative motion and they are sliding against each other. The friction force exerted between the moving surfaces is equal to a value that is proportional to the product of the normal force and the coefficient of kinetic friction : :F_k = \\\\mu_k N. In both of these cases, the frictional force always opposes the direction of motion of the object. The normal force is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object and equal to the weight of the object sliding. Example For a simple example, a block of mass m slides over a rough horizontal surface under the restraint of a spring with a spring constant k. The spring is attached to the block and mounted to an immobile object on the other end allowing the block to be moved by the force of the spring :F = k x. Because the surface is horizontal, the normal force is constant and equal to the weight of the block, or N = mg. This can be determined by summing the forces in the vertical direction. A position x is then measured horizontally to the right from the location of the block when the spring is unstretched. As stated earlier, the friction force acts in a direction opposite the motion of the block. Once put into motion the block will oscillate back and forth around the equilibrium position. Newton's Second Law states that the equation of motion of the block is m \\\\ddot x \\\\ = -k x - F or m \\\\ddot x \\\\ = -k x + F depending on the direction of motion of the block. In this equation \\\\ddot x \\\\ is the acceleration of the block and x is the position of the block. A real- life example of Coulomb damping occurs in large structures with non-welded joints such as airplane wings. Theory Coulomb damping dissipates energy constantly because of sliding friction. The magnitude of sliding friction is a constant value; independent of surface area, displacement or position, and velocity. The system undergoing Coulomb damping is periodic or oscillating and restrained by the sliding friction. Essentially, the object in the system is vibrating back and forth around an equilibrium point. A system being acted upon by Coulomb damping is nonlinear because the frictional force always opposes the direction of motion of the system as stated earlier. And because there is friction present, the amplitude of the motion decreases or decays with time. Under the influence of Coulomb damping, the amplitude decays linearly with a slope of ¬±((2Œºmgœân)/(œÄk)) where œân is the natural frequency. The natural frequency is the number of times the system oscillates between a fixed time interval in an undamped system. It should also be known that the frequency and the period of vibration do not change when the damping is constant, as in the case of Coulomb damping. The period œÑ is the amount of time between the repetition of phases during vibration. As time progresses, the object sliding slows and the distance it travels during these oscillations becomes smaller until it reaches zero, the equilibrium point. The position where the object stops, or its equilibrium position, could potentially be at a completely different position than when initially at rest because the system is nonlinear. Linear systems have only a single equilibrium point.

The complex consists of the world's two largest oil shale-fired thermal power plants, Eesti Power Plant () and Balti Power Plant (). In 2007, Narva Power Plants generated about 95% of total power production in Estonia. The complex is owned and operated by AS Narva Elektrijaamad, a subsidiary of Eesti Energia.  Balti Power Plant  The Balti Power Plant was built between 1959 and 1965. It is located south- west of Narva. As of the end of 2005, Balti Power Plant had an installed capacity of 765 MW. The installed thermal capacity was 400 MW. The cooling water is supplied from the Narva Reservoir, which is closely connected to the Narva River via two long inlet channels. The Balti Power Plant is the sole supplier of thermal power for the district heating system of Narva. The Balti Power Plant is divided into an old and a new part. The old part initially had eighteen TP-17 boilers and eight 100 MWe turbines. Four boilers and two turbines are currently in operation, while the others have been taken out of service. The new part has eight TP-67 boilers and four 200 MWe turbines. All these boilers use the pulverized combustion (PC) technology. In 2003, the Unit 11 was reconstructed to use the circulated fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology, which is more efficient and environmental-friendly (lower SO2 and CO2 emissions) than PC technology. Balti Power Plant has four flue gas stacks, which are , , and tall.  Eesti Power Plant  The Eesti Power Plant is located roughly 20 km west-south-west of Narva. It was built between 1963 and 1973. As of the end of 2005, Eesti Power Plant had installed capacity of 1,615 MW. The installed thermal capacity was 84 MW. Cooling water is supplied from the Narva River and Mustaj√µgi River via a long open channel. The Eesti Power Plant initially had sixteen TP-101 boilers and eight 200 MWe steam turbines. Fourteen boilers and seven turbines are currently in service. In 2003, the Unit 8 was reconstructed to use the CFBC technology. Eesti Power Plant has two tall flue-gas stacks, which are the tallest in Estonia. In 2014 Eesti Power Plant was named as number 15th among top 30 European Union's most polluting power plants. It also was the only listed power plant from Baltic states and Nordic countries region, emitting 10.67 Mt of CO2 per year into the atmosphere.Estonian power plant among Europe's top polluters  Auvere Power Plant  On 14 January 2011, Narva Elektrijaamad signed a contract with the French power engineering company Alstom for construction of the new Auvere Power Plant next to the existing Eesti Power Plant. The initial ‚Ç¨540 million contract foresaw a construction of a 300 MW oil shale-fired unit which was completed 2015. The unit utilizes a circulating fluidized bed boiler technology. The original contract included an option for the second unit; however, in February 2014 plans for the second unit were cancelled.  Ash disposal  The oil shale burnt at Narva plants produces roughly 46% ash, so the stations produce about 4.5 million tons of ash per year. The ash-disposal system involves washing it away with water, and the dirty water is stored in ash-storage lagoons which appear bright blue on the satellite photos. Balti has two storage areas. The western one is divided into twelve sub-regions by banks about three metres wide, and is already closed. The eastern one is in current use and is divided into three sub-regions. The ash is highly alkaline, since the non-combustible portion of the oil shale is essentially limestone.  Wind farm  In 2012 a 39 MW wind farm was erected on the closed ash field of Balti Power Plant. The wind farm consists of 17 Enercon E82 wind turbines, 2.3 MW each. The hub height is and the rotor diameter is . To fasten the generators' foundations, stakes have been drilled into the field's limestone base. The wind farm cost ‚Ç¨60 million and was completed in 2012.

She moved with her parents three years later to Portland, Oregon, where she graduated from St. Helens Hall (later incorporated in the Oregon Episcopal School) in 1898. Nan was one of five children: her siblings were Berwick Bruce, Elisa, Erskine, and William Maxwell. Her education continued later at the Finch School in New York City, where she began a lifelong friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt. Political life She married David Honeyman in 1907, with whom she raised three children and was active in civic and humanitarian organizations before becoming involved in politics. Honeyman served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933, which ratified the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, repealing prohibition. She was a member of the Oregon House of Representatives from 1935 to 1937 and served as a delegate to the Democratic national conventions in 1936 and 1940. Honeyman was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives, representing Oregon's 3rd congressional district and served from 1937 to 1939, the first congresswoman from Oregon. While in Congress, Honeyman was a strong supporter of the New Deal and the completion of the Bonneville Dam. However, her bids for reelection in 1938 and election in 1940 were unsuccessful. She held the position of senior representative of the Pacific Coast Office of Price Administration from 1941 to 1942.

In 1942, her father and several other relatives sued Honeyman and her husband over her husband's mismanagement of several family trusts. The court determined David Honeyman had misappropriated in excess of $100,000 of trust funds while Nan was left blameless. In 1946, the case was finally resolved after the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling, which came after Honeyman's father died in 1944.

From Goa he traveled to Surat, Ahmedabad, Rajasthan and Delhi, arriving in Agra (the seat of the Jesuit mission in Northern India) on 15 September 1714. From there he returned to Delhi, where he met his superior and travel companion, the Portuguese Jesuit Manoel Freyre. Together they traveled from Delhi to Srinagar in Kashmir (where they were delayed for six months, and Desideri suffered a nearly fatal intestinal illness), and from Kashmir to Leh, capital of Ladakh, arriving there at the end of June, 1715. According to Desideri, they were well received by the king of Ladakh and his court, and he wished to remain there to found a mission, but he was forced to obey his Superior, Freyre, who insisted that they travel to Central Tibet and Lhasa. They thus undertook a perilous seven months winter journey across the Tibetan plateau; ill-prepared and inexperienced, their very survival was likely due to the help they received from Casal, the Mongol governor (and widow of the previous governor of Western Tibet), who was leaving her post and returning to Lhasa. They journeyed with her armed caravan, and finally arrived in Lhasa on 18 March 1716. After a few weeks Freyre returned to India, via Kathmandu and Patna, leaving Desideri in charge of the mission. He was the only European missionary in Tibet, at that time. Settling down in Lhasa Soon after arriving in Lhasa, Desideri was received in audience by the Mongol ruler of Tibet, Lhasang Khan, who gave him permission to rent a house in Lhasa and to practice and teach Christianity. After reading Desideri's first work in Tibetan, on the basics of Catholic doctrine, Lasang Khan advised him to improve his Tibetan and learn the Tibetan Buddhist religious and philosophical literature. After some months of intensive study he entered the Sera monastic university, one of the three great seats of learning of the politically involved Gelukpa. There he studied and debated with Tibetan monks and scholars, and was permitted to have a Christian chapel in his rooms. He learned the language (unknown to Europeans before) and became a voracious student of the culture. At the end of 1717 he was forced to leave Lhasa due to the unrest caused by the invasion of the Dzungar Mongols. He retired to the Capuchin hospice in Dakpo province, in South Central Tibet, although he did return to Lhasa for considerable periods during the period 1719-1720. Between 1718 and 1721 he composed five works in literary Tibetan, in which he taught Christian doctrines and attempted to refute the Buddhist concepts of rebirth (which he referred to as \\"metempsychosis\\") and 'Emptiness' (Wylie: stong pa nyid; Sanskrit: ≈õunyatƒÅ). In these books Desideri utilized the Tibetan Buddhist techniques of scholastic argumentation, and accepted parts of Buddhism that he did not see as contradictory to Catholic teaching, especially Buddhist moral philosophy. Conflict with the Capuchins Italian missionaries of the Capuchin Order had been granted the Tibetan mission in 1703 by the Propaganda Fide, the branch of the Church administration that controlled Catholic missionary activity worldwide. Three Capuchins arrived in Lhasa in October 1716, and promptly presented documents to Desideri that they claimed confirmed their exclusive right to the Tibetan mission by the Propaganda. Desideri contested the charge of disobedience to the Propaganda Fide, and both sides complained to Rome. In the meantime Desideri helped his Capuchin co-religionists in acclimating to Tibet. While the Capuchins had no quarrel with Desideri personally, they feared that other Jesuits would follow and displace them from Tibet and Nepal, and they petitioned for his expulsion from the country. In January 1721, Desideri received the order to leave Tibet and return to India. After a long stay in Kuti, at the Tibetan-Nepali border, he returned to Agra in 1722. Later years At Agra, Desideri was appointed head pastor of the Catholic community in the Mughal capital of Delhi. He organized education and services for the community, and had a new church built to replace the former dilapidated edifice. In 1725 he went to the French Jesuit Malabar mission in Pondicherry, and set to work learning the Tamil language and carrying on the mission there. In 1727 he was sent to Rome to promote the cause of the beatification of John de Britto, a Jesuit who had died a martyr in South- India. He took along his very extensive notes on Tibet, its culture and religion, and began work on his Relation, which in its latest manuscript was called \\"Historical Notices of Tibet\\" (Notizie Istoriche del Tibet) while still homeward bound on a French vessel. He landed in France in August 1727, and after a stay in that country, where he met with important cardinals and aristocrats and had an audience with King Louis XV, he arrived in Rome in January 1728. He took up residence in the Jesuit professed house, and his time was fully occupied in the legal proceedings at the Propaganda Fide between himself, representing the Jesuit order, and Fr. Felice di Montecchio, who fiercely prosecuted the Capuchin case; Desideri wrote three Defenses of the Jesuit position. On 29 November 1732, the Propaganda issued its final terse order on the matter, confirming the exclusive right of the Capuchins to the Tibet mission, and forbidding any further discussion on the subject. Desideri had been working during this time on revising the Relation and was preparing it for publication, which was forbidden by the Propaganda order. Manuscripts of this monumental work, comprising the first accurate account of Tibetan geography, government, agriculture, customs, and Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and belief, were buried in the Jesuit archives and a private collection, and did not come to light until the late 19th century; the Relation finally appeared in a complete edition by Luciano Petech which was published in the 1950s. An abridged English translation was published in 1937, and a complete translation in 2010.

It was primarily sponsored by The Borden Company. Production of the series was overseen by George Burns's company, McCadden Productions. It stars Jackie Cooper as Socrates \\"Sock\\" Miller, who is a former Marine Korean War veteran and a young politician living in fictitious New City, California. Sock has a basset hound named \\"Cleo\\", whose thoughts (voiced by Mary Jane Croft), baleful observations of Sock's dilemmas, are recorded on the soundtrack for the viewers' amusement. The real name of the dog that played Cleo was \\"Bernadette\\". Much of Cleo's dialog consists of wisecracks. The popularity of the basset hound breed increased markedly with the run of the show. Overview In the first season, Sock is an ornithologist and a city council member, who is living in a trailer park with his maiden Aunt \\"Gus\\" Bennett, short for Augusta (Margaret Irving) who had raised Sock after his parent's death when Sock was three years of age.p. 143 Terrace, Vincent Television Series of the 1950s: Essential Facts and Quirky Details Rowman & Littlefield, 16 May 2016 Sock is dating Amanda \\"Mandy\\" Peoples (Patricia Breslin), the daughter of the mayor (Paul Maxey), who does not entirely approve of the relationship, but he gradually warms to Sock. Later, Sock takes courses (though he is not in law school) to pass the California bar exam in order to become an attorney, so that he can then afford to marry Mandy. In the first season finale, Sock suddenly proposes to Mandy and wants to elope. He is afraid the mayor will want to stage a big wedding, and they won't be able to get married for many months. The couple drives to Nevada for a quickie wedding, intending to return in time for Sock to take his bar exam. On the way back, they are arrested for a traffic violation and must spend the night in jail. This causes Sock to miss the bar exam. Sock wants to be independent of his father-in-law; so the couple agrees to keep their marriage a secret from the mayor until Sock gets his law license. Most episodes in the second season are about Sock and Mandy trying to be together (as much as this could be depicted in the 1950s), while keeping the mayor from finding out that they are married. At some point during the season, Aunt Gus and the mayor get married, and she learns that Sock and Mandy are married and agrees to keep their secret from the mayor. By the end of the season, Sock has passed the bar, and their marriage is out in the open. Sock's scheming Marine buddy, Rollo \\"The Hex\\" Hexley (Dick Wesson), moved in with Sock during the second season and appeared in twenty-seven episodes as well as the original 1955 pilot.The People's Choice: Pilot (1955) In the third season, Sock manages a residential real estate development called \\"Barkerville Estates.\\" They still return to New City often enough for Mayor Peoples and Aunt Gus to appear regularly.

Although The People's Choice never made the top 30 programs, its ratings were respectable enough to warrant a place on NBC for three seasons. The show later became quite popular in syndication enjoying continuous daytime repeat broadcasts for more than a decade in several local markets following its original network run. During its first year, The People's Choice aired opposite Stop the Music as that long-running ABC series was concluding its final season. Spin-off From The People's Choice, Cleo the talking dog spawned the idea of a talking baby in the 1960‚Äì1961 NBC sitcom, Happy starring Ronnie Burns and Yvonne Lime Fedderson, who had also guest starred on The People's Choice.

Wych Street was a street in London, roughly where Australia House now stands on Aldwych. It ran west from the church of St Clement Danes on the Strand to a point towards the southern end of Drury Lane. The street was demolished by the London County Council in around 1901, as part of the redevelopment that created the Kingsway and Aldwych. History Wych Street, on a plan of 1888 The area around Drury Lane was not affected by the Great Fire of London, and contained decrepit Elizabethan houses, with projecting wooden jetties. The Angel Inn public house was at the bottom of Wych Street, by the Strand. To the west, about halfway along on the north side, was the New Inn, an Inn of Chancery where Sir Thomas More received his early legal education, and, to the south, Lyon's Inn, another Inn of Chancery where Sir Edward Coke was a reader in 1578, which was replaced by a Globe Theatre and the Opera Comique in c.1863. A 1901 postcard of Wych Street, shortly before its demolition At the western end was Drury House, the house of Sir Robert Drury, from which Drury Lane took its name, later rebuilt as Craven House by Lord Craven, and finally turned into a public house, the \\"Queen of Bohemia\\", named after Lord Craven's unrequited love, Elizabeth of Bohemia, the daughter of James I. This building was later demolished, and replaced by the first Olympic Theatre. Jack Sheppard, the infamous thief, was apprenticed to a carpenter, Mr. Wood, on Wych Street; one of Sheppard's haunts, the White Lion tavern, was also on Wych Street. The music hall performer Arthur Lloyd lived at 39 Wych Street in 1892. Around 1780, the brothers George and John Jacob Astor, who later became America's first multimillionaire, ran an instrument store in 26 Wych Street. In popular culture Where Was Wych Street? is one of the best loved short stories by Stacy Aumonier (1877‚Äì1928). In Patrick O'Brian's novel Post Captain (1972), the character Dr. Stephen Maturin is in London in late September 1804, reporting to the Admiralty in his capacity as a naval intelligence agent. Having left the Admiralty building on Whitehall, he intends to \\"wander[] among the bookstalls of Wych Street,\\" but because of the rain he decides instead to return to his inn. (Ch. 14.)

The show's title is both a play on the long-running PBS anthology program Masterpiece Theatre and a reference to the low-budget, campy science fiction and horror films that were lampooned each week. At the time of Disasterpiece Theatre's run, XETV was an independent station; today it serves as the Tijuana affiliate of Canal 5. The premise of the show was simple: show the worst movies ever made and make fun of them. Among the films shown were Shriek of the Mutilated, Monster on Campus, The Thing That Couldn't Die, The Mummy's Hand, Born to Speed, Big Boy Rides Again, First Spaceship on Venus and Curse of the Undead. Comments would be written as subtitles during the movie; for example, in Track of the Moonbeast a character says, \\"I'm somewhat of an...(laughs) an adventurer,\\" and the word \\"IDIOT\\" appeared on screen during the pause in the middle of the sentence. Sometimes music would be added and, in some cases, redubbing by the writers would occur. On a showing of First Spaceship on Venus, the soundtrack was replaced by the writers' voices arguing about which television show they are going to watch, similar to the overdubbing idea in What's Up, Tiger Lily? Jay Curtis hosted the show as Sal U. Lloyd, a play on the word celluloid. Bruce Mueller played \\"The Other Guy\\" and would often dress up as The Mummy, A Lion Tamer, and the Network Producer. Curtis and Mueller wrote and produced the show. Fred Stern was a constant contributor and served as the show's musical director. Stern chose popular music that was added to scenes for comic punctuation. As an example, during the film Beginning of the End, giant grasshoppers are attacking Chicago, scientists decide to use the grasshopper mating call to lure the creatures into Lake Michigan but instead of the mating call coming from a boat loudspeaker, the audience hears At the Hop by Danny and the Juniors and the monsters hop in and drown. San Diego radio announcer Gary Cocker appeared on the show many times. Guests included Whoopi Goldberg, Richard Simmons, and J. Michael Straczynski. The show was done so cheaply, the producers would tape over the same reels, thus erasing the previous episode. In the show, Curtis and Mueller's microphone cords are easily visible, but it is the poor production quality that makes the show more humorous. Sal U. Lloyd was portrayed as a big loser who hates his job. In one episode, he explains his position: \\"I'm sick of television... I wanna be a rock and roll star. I wanna make some money.\\" He is often seen receiving some kind of brain damage after showing a movie. Several times, Lloyd has a run-in with the network producer, George Mucas (obviously a parody of George Lucas), who hates the show. In reality, Curtis had a strong rivalry with the actual network producer of XETV, who eventually cancelled the show. The show became quite successful, generating a loyal following and beating Saturday Night Live in the ratings several times. However, the show was eventually cancelled due to creative control with the station. Although the show is not widely acclaimed, it is mentionable for inspiring a generation of cult television shows that used the same premise, such as Mystery Science Theater 3000. In 1991, the Beetlejuice episode \\"Moby Richard\\" had Lydia staging a television dramatization of \\"Moby Dick\\" for the Neitherworld program \\"Disasterpiece Theatre.\\" In 1993, Animaniacs had an episode of the same title. In 2009, the creators of Disasterpiece Theatre created a YouTube Page posting archival footage of the show.

He first appeared on-screen in the episode airing on 5 February 1990. He arrives in Erinsborough following his father's relocation to the area. Producers hired Angerson because they were increasing the size of the male cast. Josh is characterised as academically bright and good at chemistry. During his tenure Josh helped to form the show's group of teenage characters consisting of himself, Todd Landers (Kristian Schmid), Melissa Jarrett (Jade Amenta) and Cody Willis (Amelia Frid). Josh departed the series during the episode broadcast on 14 April 1992. Casting When Craig McLachlan quit his role of Henry Ramsay to star in rival soap opera Home and Away, producers decided to introduce two new characters to help Neighbours recuperate. Jeremy Angerson was cast in the role of Josh, while Richard Norton was selected to play Ryan McLachlan. Angerson and Norton moved in together in a flat share to accommodate filming for the show. When Angerson was fifteen, he worked at the Adelaide Grand Prix selling souvenirs and met a casting director who worked for Neighbours. When Angerson auditioned for the role, the same casting director was responsible for hiring him to play Josh. Describing the process, Angerson told Steve Smith from Fast Forward that \\"When I was living in Adelaide a talent scout came up about once a year. I didn't hear much about casting in Melbourne for the programme but I got an audition for it and was lucky enough to get the part. It was a complete surprise!\\" Character development The character is introduced into the series following his father's purchase of a local news agents.Hayward 1991, p. 149. Josh is characterised as friendly, intelligent and \\"bright academically\\" with a keen interest in football and chemistry. He uses the latter to play pranks on people which often leads him into trouble. Writers gave him a best friend in the form of established character Todd Landers (Kristian Schmid) who bonded over mutual interests. Anthony Hayward wrote in his book The who's who of soap operas that \\"enjoying Todd's popularity with girls, Josh has tried to get advice from him on how to get on with the opposite sex, but he has never managed to attain the same degree of success.\\"Hayward 1991, p. 150. Angerson described Josh as \\"a black sheep and a bit naive\\" and thought Todd was the more \\"heroic\\" of the two characters. Josh was part of the show's teenage group of characters which comprised himself, Todd, Melissa Jarrett (Jade Amenta) and Cody Willis (Amelia Frid). Angerson was the oldest of the four actors and the only one not in school. The characters were involved in a storyline dubbed \\"TV's first love quadrangle\\". Josh was in the relationship with Cody, while Todd was with Melissa but producers decided to swap the couple around. When Melissa is banned from seeing Todd, she realises that she is attracted to Josh while Cody hides her feelings for Todd. They all remain unsure of how to tell their respective partners that they have fallen for someone else. Frid told Caron Eastgate from TV Week that \\"it's funny to be swapping partners, but I think it's very cute.\\" Angerson added that he enjoyed playing his character's romance storylines because he had a good time with his fellow actors. When the truth is outed Josh begins a relationship with Melissa and Cody begins dating Todd. Schmid believed that Josh was not a nice guy. Josh was the first male stripper to feature in Neighbours. He wore a Roman soldier costume during his routine. Angerson later recalled a storyline in which Josh performed a strip routine in front of his school principal Dorothy Burke (Maggie Dence), and joked \\"Everything came off except for my Roman helmet!\\" Writers also created a relationship story with Phoebe Bright (Simone Robertson), which ended when Angerson was written out of the series. His departure story featured Josh deciding to leave Erinsborough. In 1991, Angerson told a reporter from TV Hits that he would often swear by accident during filming, but added it was always relevant to the scene. Angerson was also unhappy with a storyline in which his character played a game of strip poker. He was required to strip during filming. He had stripped on-screen previously but believed as an actor his body should be private. Schmid also bemoaned Josh's storyline for being \\"embarrassing\\" and \\"awful\\", with numerous retakes and a \\"monotonous\\" day of filming. Storylines Josh is first seen in the Coffee Shop on Todd's 16th birthday and they quickly become friends after learning that Josh is new to the area and will be starting Year 10 at Erinsborough High with Todd and they share a common interest- soccer. Todd invites Josh back to his home for his birthday dinner, but when Josh reveals that he asked Melissa out on a date, it doesn't sit well with Todd. Josh realises Melissa still likes Todd and backs off. Josh begins dating Cody, who had previously caused Todd and Melissa problems in their relationship and they begin going out for several months. However, Cody is still attracted to Todd and promptly dumps Josh without explanation. Meanwhile, Josh finds himself becoming more and more attracted to Melissa the more time they spend together studying. The teens soon realise they are all dating the wrong people and agree to swap partners. When Todd falls in with local criminal Gary \\"Boof\\" Head (Stephen Hall), Josh tries to make Todd see sense. One evening when Todd is attacked by Boof for informing the police, Josh comes to his friend's aid and subdues Boof with a few kick- boxing moves. Josh agrees to help Melissa in her scheme to expose Lassiter's for using frozen tuna and they sneak into the kitchens and head towards the fridge where they find the tuna but a kitchen hand shuts the door, leaving Josh and Melissa trapped. Josh quickly stops the fan from freezing them but Melissa is in danger due to suffering from epilepsy and not having her medication to hand. The couple are saved but Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) is unimpressed with the damage to the fridge and demands payment for the damages. When Josh begins violin lessons and constantly talks about a woman named Katrina Riley (Jane Conroy), Melissa is quick to accuse him of cheating on her with another girl. Melissa tracks down Katrina and realizes she is much older than Josh and has worried for nothing. After a runaway truck ploughs into the Andersons' newsagents, Josh and his family are left homeless and jobless with the prospect of having to return to Mildura, which Josh does not really want as he has made friends and is settled in Erinsborough. Jim (Alan Dale), Todd's uncle agrees to let Josh stay at Number 26 and share a room with Todd. When Josh is subpoenaed to testify against Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), Jim's mother-in-law, who is suing a hotel after a fall, He is torn between perjuring himself or making Helen look bad on the stand. Under pressure, Josh flees and retreats to his old garage. School principal Dorothy Burke (Maggie Dence) convinces Josh to return to the Robinsons. Shortly after Melissa and her family move to America, Josh finds himself attracted to Lucy, Todd's cousin, who is home from boarding school. Josh is shocked and appalled when he realises that Lucy is attracted to her new-found half-brother, Glen Donnelly (Richard Huggett). Josh later supports Lucy in the ensuing fallout. Josh continues to woo Lucy by buying her expensive gifts, and even going as far as hacking into Erinsborough High's computer system to change her grades. When Josh owns up to Dorothy about the hacking and takes the rap, Lucy admits she changed the grades herself after Josh backed out and left the computer on. One day while working on a surfboard in the garage, Josh accidentally splashes some acetone in his eyes, rendering him temporarily blind. While out with Todd and Brad Willis (Scott Michaelson) one day, Josh wonders into the road and is narrowly missed by a car. Lucy agrees to help Josh until his sight returns. When it does, Josh doesn't hurry to let anyone know and keeps up the pretence of being blind to enjoy Lucy's affections. When Josh finds himself short of money, he takes a job as a stripper using a gladiator's costume to disguise him. When one of the bookings is for Helen's hen party, Josh panics at first but then realises no-one will recognise him. At the end of his act, Josh's helmet is removed by Caroline Alessi (Gillian Blakeney) and his identity exposed, leaving him embarrassed. However, Josh's confidence is restored when his friends tell him not to be ashamed of his body. Josh later asks bookish classmate Phoebe on a date, but she is upset when it is revealed that the only reason Josh has done so is because of a bet he lost with Todd and Brad. Josh does fall for Phoebe for real when they are cast in the Year 11 production of Beauty and the Beast. They begin dating but Phoebe's father, Arthur (Barry Hill) disapproves of Josh and warns him off. After Arthur suffers a heart attack, he lets Josh continue seeing his daughter. After returning home from spending Christmas 1991 in Surfers Paradise with Brad and Lucy, Josh discovers that Todd and Phoebe have fallen in love with each other and he refuses to have anything to do with either of them. Josh dates Phoebe's arch-enemy Trish Longley (Susan Ellis) to prove that he doesn't care that his feelings are hurt. Trish later plants an exam paper in Phoebe's locker as revenge, which Josh gets the blame for causing more friction between them. However, after a talk with Jim they eventually patch up their differences with Josh before he leaves Erinsborough to return to his parents in Mildura. Reception To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Neighbours, the BBC asked readers to nominate their 20 favourite obscure characters. Josh came in second place and the readers said \\"All I can remember is that something happened to cause him to lose his sight and then he tried to pinch Todd's girlfriend\\".

Specific conditions apply to auction races restricted to horses sold at public auctions. National Hunt racing A novice in National Hunt horse racing is a horse which has not won in a particular type of race prior to the start of the current season. A novice hurdler has not won a hurdle race before the start of the current season, while a novice chaser has not won a steeplechase before the start of the current season. A novice remains a novice until the end of the season in which it gains its first win in that particular category, no matter how many wins it achieves. Generally novices race against other novices although there is no restriction preventing novices competing against more experienced rivals. Occasionally a novice wins a major race outside novice company - Captain Christy and Coneygree both won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1974 and 2015 respectively as novices, as did Make A Stand in the 1997 Champion Hurdle.

In addition to Washington Boulevard, the hotel also fronted Bagley Street and Park Avenue. History The hotel was designed for Statler Hotels by George B. Post and Louis Rorimer in the Georgian architectural style, with English Renaissance Revival roots evident. P. 68. It consisted of 18 floors: sixteen above grade and two basement floors. Construction began on the original 800-room portion in 1914 and was completed in 1915.Statler Hotel. Historic Detroit. Retrieved on December 9, 2013. Harry Houdini stayed at the hotel in October 1926, during his last engagement at the nearby Garrick Theater. The Detroit Statler became part of the Hilton Hotels chain in 1954 along with all other former Statler Hotels. Hilton proceeded to remodel and modernize the hotel's interior during the 1960s. In 1974, Hilton ceased their management, and the structure was renamed the Detroit Heritage Hotel until it was abandoned in 1975. After sitting vacant for 30 years, the structure was eventually demolished following approval by the Detroit Historic District Commission. Demolition of the building floor by floor began in August 2005 and was completed in time for the Super Bowl XL; the process took months due to the hotel's strong concrete structure. During the demolition process, a vacant four-story building once occupied by the Automobile Club of Michigan also known as the DAIIE (Detroit Automobile Club Inter-Insurance Exchange) building on a neighboring lot caught fire. The fire destroyed much of the structure's roof and upper floor. The cause of the blaze was determined to be hot metal material that had been dropped from the Statler Hotel onto the Automobile Club building's roof. The building's structure required the onsite treatment of 750,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated water following demolition. Vacant lot where the Detroit Statler Hotel once stood 2014 Apartment Proposal On 26 March 2014, a 200-250 unit apartment building was announced to be built on the former site of the Statler Hotel. At the time of its proposal, this building would have been one of the first entirely newly constructed apartments in downtown Detroit since the early 1990s (excluding apartments built from converted offices). Detroit City Council gave the project a go ahead after approval http://www.freep.com/article/20140326/BUSINESS06/303260148/Michigan- jobs-unemployment The proposal is vastly under scale for its surroundings and in a time when development downtown is occurring at a pace not seen since the 1920s due to an increase in demand for downtown living. The property is owned by the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and some critics have stated that the land should go to a developer that is capable of producing a larger, higher quality building in scale with the value of the property's location.https://www.detroityes.com/mb/showthread.php?22366-Statler-site- construction-to-start-this-summer Facts * A lawsuit by preservationists temporarily delayed the city's plans to demolish the former hotel building. * The hotel had proven so popular that a 200-room addition was added onto the back of the hotel along Washington Boulevard. * According to the original blueprints, one of the penthouse roof levels lies at 226' above the street, and Sanborn Maps list the other at 232' above the street.

It is held in a Roman amphitheater known as the Pula Arena. Pula Film Festival is the oldest Croatian film festival and is usually held in the summer, in July or August. Apart from film screenings open to the public, the annual Croatian film industry awards are also traditionally presented at the festival. The awards presented at the festival (called Golden Arenas) are the main national film awards in the country and they serve as the Croatian equivalent of the American Academy Awards, British BAFTA Awards, Spain's Goya Awards, France's C√©sar Award, etc. The festival was originally started in 1954 and within a few years it became the centrepiece event of the Yugoslav film industry, with first national awards being presented in 1957. This lasted until 1991, when the festival was cancelled due to the breakup of Yugoslavia, only to resume in 1992 as the Croatian film awards festival. It has been held every year since (with the exception of the 1994 edition which was also cancelled). History When it was established, it was known as the Festival of Yugoslav Film, and it quickly became the most important national film festival in SFR Yugoslavia. Over the following decades the festival gained considerable recognition internationally, along with the Yugoslav film industry which continued to thrive since the 1960s. Many film production companies were soon founded across the former Yugoslavia and the industry released about 20 new feature films for nationwide distribution every year. These films competed for a number of awards at the festival, since the award categories and the festival concept were modeled after the Academy Awards. However, the festival often served as a launching pad for new films before being released in cinemas nationwide, so - unlike the Academy Awards - the festival usually marked the beginning of a new season for filmgoers, not its ending. In 1991 the festival was cancelled because of the outbreak of the war and the related breakup of Yugoslavia. In 1992 the festival was restarted, but it was renamed Filmski festival u Puli (eng: Pula Film Festival). The 1992 edition was also the first one that was dedicated solely to Croatian films, since the unified Yugoslav film industry disappeared along with the former country. In 1995 it was renamed again and called Festival hrvatskog filma (eng: Croatian Film Festival) to emphasize its now exclusively Croatian character. However, since the Croatian film industry proved to be insufficiently productive, with only a handful of new titles being released each year, the festival's popularity rapidly plummeted. In order to rectify this, the festival opened for foreign films for the first time in its history in 2001, and was renamed once again to Festival hrvatskog i europskog filma (eng: Croatian and European Film Festival). From then on, apart from screenings of Croatian films, the festival also regularly offers an international program, as well as various one-off theme programs and retrospectives. Golden Arena awards The national film industry awards called Golden Arena are always presented at the festival. All the locally produced feature films made in the preceding 12 months are screened at the festival and everyone involved in making them automatically qualify for the Golden Arena award in their respective category.

A prominent director for Universal Pictures in the 1940s and 1950s, he is perhaps best known today as the man who gave Clint Eastwood his first contract in film. Lubin in 1928 Early life Arthur William Lubovsky was born in Los Angeles in 1898. His father, William Lubovsky, had come to the US from Poland in 1889. Lubovsky changed his name to Lubin in honour of filmmaker Siegmund Lubin and became a salesman. His family moved to Jerome, Arizona when Arthur was five. He was interested in acting at an early age, appearing in local Sunday school productions, with the encouragement of his mother, who died when Lubin was six. His father remarried and the family moved from Jerome to San Diego when Lubin was eight. He managed the music and drama clubs at high school and said a key influence was playing the title role in The Vicar of Wakefield.Davis, p. 174. He joined the San Diego Stock Company at $12 a week; the director was John Griffith Wray and the actors including Harold Lloyd. As a child he had worked as a water boy for touring theatre companies and volunteered for circuses. He briefly served in the navy in World War One and attended Page Military Academy and Carnegie Tech, where he studied drama and made money by shifting scenery and props. On graduation from college in 1922, he decided to become an actor. He worked as a drama coach at Canadian Steel Mills before following one of his college drama teachers, B. Iden Payne, to New York. Actor In New York, Lubin managed to get work on stage in such plays as The Red Poppy, Anything Might Happen and My Aunt from Ypsilanti. None of these plays were particularly successful so he moved to Hollywood, where he succeeded in getting roles in some films such as His People. He also acted in stage, notably at the Potboiler Act Theatre. In 1925, the Los Angeles Times called Lubin \\"one of this year's juvenile screen sensations.\\" He began directing shows for the Hollywood Writers Club. As an actor, he specialized in heavy melodrama, in sharp contrast with his later work as a film director. He later said \\"every part that Joseph Schildkraut did in New York, I did... on the Coast [Los Angeles]\\".Flynn & McCarthy p 364 He appeared in Lillion. In 1925 he and some friends were charged with obscenity by the Los Angeles police for putting on a production of Eugene O'Neill's Desire Under the Elms. He later worked on Broadway, including Jealousy, where he replaced John Halliday opposite Fay Bainter. A 1926 profile described him as a \\"genius\\" actor who was very down to earth: \\"When I met him, it was if I were meeting a young banker or a matter of fact businessman... human and charming... not only good but awfully good looking.\\" His films as an actor included The Woman on the Jury (1924), His People (1925), Bardelys the Magnificent (1926) with John Gilbert for King Vidor, Millionaires (1926), Afraid to Love (1927), The Wedding March (1928), The Bushranger (1928), Eyes of the Underworld (1929) and Times Square (1929), an early talking picture. Over time Lubin's interests increasingly leant towards directing. \\"On the stage I had a personality I never had in pictures,\\" he said. \\"That's one of the reasons I got the hell out of acting.\\"Davis, p. 176. \\"Every director should have acting experience,\\" he later said. \\"You can talk their language. You know the problems. You know how the scene should be acted. Too many directors are former writers. They have the scene in their mind but they don't know what the actor has to do to interpret it.\\" Director and producer=Theatre Lubin returned to New York gaining a job casting and directing with the firm of Crosby Graige and Selwyn. They wanted to try out summer shows in Greenwich and he directed two plays there. He went out to California and briefly returned to acting in Pasadena, then decided to stick with directing. He tried out two plays at the Pasadena Playhouse which he later produced and directed in New York with the financial help of Lee Schubert. He produced When the Bough Breaks with Pauline Frederick, One Man with Paul Muni and another play with Lenore Ulric. He worked for nine months for the Ray-Minor Company, a subsidiary of Paramount. He later sued them for unpaid wages. However working for Ray-Minor which brought him to the attention of that studio's chief, B.P. Schulberg. Paramount In June 1932, Lubin returned to Hollywood to work for William Le Baron at Paramount as an associate producer. His contract included the right to return to New York in the first six months to produce and direct a play. Lubin began directing Little Theatre in his spare time, including productions of Lilliom, and got reputation for doing \\"outstanding work\\". He was fired from Paramount as part of an economy drive.Davis, p. 177. Monogram and Republic Lubin received acclaim for directing a theatre production of The Green Bay Tree. He said \\"a man who knew my family said to me, 'Why don't you come with us and Trem Carr and direct a picture?'\\"Flynn & McCarthy p 364 This was at Monogram, where he directed his first film as directorA Successful Failure (1934). It was followed by Great God Gold (1935) and Honeymoon Limited (1935), all of which were produced by Carr. Carr went to MGM and Lubin moved over to Republic Pictures when they merged with Monogram. In May 1935, he signed a contract with Republic for a year to make six pictures starting with Two Black Sheep which became Two Sinners. He also made an experimental film, Journey by Train, He later made Frisco Waterfront (1935) and The House of a Thousand Candles (1936). These were produced by Nat Levine. In August 1935, Variety wrote about Republic, \\"under such fast production methods and with the limited budget [around $50,000 a film], training here is perfect for a jump into the big league. Arthur Lubin started with Republic last year, has so far turned out three good pictures.\\" He was reportedly directing The Leavenworth Case but is not credited on the film. Universal In 1936, he signed a contract with Universal starting 15 April. His first film for them was Yellowstone (1936). It was followed by Mysterious Crossing (1936), then a series of films with a young John Wayne: California Crossing (1937), I Cover the War (1937), Idol of the Crowds (1937) and Adventure's End (1937). \\"No one thought that Duke would ever amount to anything,\\" recalled Lubin.Davis, p. 179. The films were shot in six days. \\"I had the reputation of doing pictures quickly and bringing them in on schedule,\\" he said.Flynn & McCarthy p 365 In August 1937, he was in a car crash. After Midnight Intruder (1938) with Louis Hayward, Lubin went over to Warner Bros., for The Beloved Brat (1938) then returned to Universal: Prison Break (1938), Secrets of a Nurse (1938), Newsboys' Home (1938), Risky Business (1939), Big Town Czar (1939), Mickey the Kid (1939), Call a Messenger (1939, with The Little Tough Guys), and The Big Guy (1939). Lubin said \\"possibly one of the reasons I was used so much at Universal was my very wonderful early training as a director under Trem Carr.\\"Flynn & McCarthy p364 A higher profile project was Black Friday (1940), with Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. He went back to Republic to make Gangs of Chicago (1940) then returned to Universal: Meet the Wildcat (1940), I'm Nobody's Sweetheart Now (1940), Who Killed Aunt Maggie? (1940), The San Francisco Docks (1941) and Where Did You Get That Girl? (1941). Abbott and Costello Lubin's career received a big break when he was assigned to direct the first Abbott and Costello star vehicle, Buck Privates (1941). The movie was a big hit, earning $4 million ‚Äì Lubin, who was paid $350 a week, was given a $5,000 bonus. \\"It was very little credit to the director,\\" said Lubin later. \\"It consisted mainly of fabulous gags that these two wonderful guys knew from years and years of being in burlesque.\\"Flynn & McCarthy p 366 He directed the double act's next four movies, In the Navy (1941), which earned him another $5,000 bonus, Hold That Ghost (1941), shot before In the Navy but released afterwards, Keep 'Em Flying (1942) and Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942), shot before Keep 'Em Flying but released afterwards.Furmanek, p. 48 All the films were successful ‚Äì the services comedies between them brought in over $6 million and Variety magazine named Lubin the most commercially successful director in Hollywood in 1941. Variety said \\"Lubin, who was considered just another camera flagger, is now the leader of the entire topfligt group of directors with respect to getting coin into the box office.\\" Lubin would use two cameras directing the duo, one on a two shot, the other on Lou. He said the cameras were on a dolly because the team could not be trusted to stay in position.Flynn & McCarthy p 368 However Lubin says after the fifth film he asked if he could work on other movies: > They came on the set late, they didn't know their lines, and I think they > were beginning to get tired of one another. They were bored. and for the > first time they were beginning to complain about the scripts. But it was > five fabulous pictures with the boys. They were very good for me. They gave > me a reputation. I learned everything about timing from them. And I think I > was very good for them, in this respect: not their routines, but in trying > to give them some class. Whenever they got crude or rude, I'd try to soften > it. And I tried in all my set-ups to keep a balance of refinement against > the earthiness of some of their routines.Furmanek, p. 68. Lubin with Mary Pickford in 1943 At Universal and other studios In January 1942, Lubin was assigned to an expensive war film, Eagle Squadron (1942), which was a massive hit. He was now established as one of Universal's leading directors. In 1942, The New York Times published a profile on the director which commented: > On the set, Lubin is personally intense, but an easy boss to his casts. He > is friendly and witty. Players like to work for him. He strives to keep them > relaxed for the cameras. Holding a pow-wow before rehearsing a scene, he > will frequently sit cross legged on the floor with the players seated about > him. But when the camera starts going, so does Lubin. He is a pacer... He > pantomimed all the parts Lubin made White Savage (1943) with Maria Montez, Jon Hall and Sabu, then was given his largest ever budget when he replaced Henry Koster on Phantom of the Opera (1943) with Claude Rains. This was a great success commercially, as was Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (1944) with Montez, Hall and Sabu. Lubin tried to get into the Signal Corps but they said he was more valuable making documentaries.Flynn & McCarthy p 367 Delightfully Dangerous (1945) was made for Hunt Stromberg and his old boss Charles Rogers at United Artists. Back at Universal he made The Spider Woman Strikes Back (1946), which he said he \\"hated\\" and did not want to do but the studio threatened to put him on suspension.Davis, p. 182. This was followed by the expensive box office disappointment Night in Paradise (1946). After the failure of this movie, Universal elected not to review his contract. Independent Producer He made two more for United Artists, New Orleans (1947) and Impact (1949). Lubin continued to direct theatre on the side, doing This Young World at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1948. Francis the Talking Mule He bought the rights to a series of books about Francis the Talking Mule and set up the project as a film at Universal. Francis (1950) was a big hit, leading to a series of films directed by Lubin, in which the director had a percentage of the profits. (Although records show Universal paid Lubin a flat fee of $25,000 to direct - $5,000 more than he had been paid for A Night in Paradise.) Francis Goes to the Races (1952) was the first sequel. Lubin also made Queen for a Day (1951) for United Artists, and Rhubarb (1951) for Paramount. The latter film is about a cat that inherits a baseball team by proxy. Lubin was worried about being typed as an animal director. \\"Everyone seems to forget I once directed John Wayne,\\" he said.Lubin Kicks About Mules; 'Show Boat' Name Under Fire Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 29 July 1951: D7. He made Francis Goes to West Point (1952), It Grows on Trees (1952), which was Irene Dunne's last film, South Sea Woman (1953) with Burt Lancaster at Warner Bros, and Francis Covers the Big Town (1953). He complained during filming the latter that he was becoming typecast as an animal director. He hoped to make The Interruption from a suspense story by W. W. Mason \\"just to remind producers that I can direct people too.\\" After the swashbuckler Star of India (1954) at United Artists, shot in England, there was Francis Joins the WACS (1954) before he succeeded in filming Interruption in England; this was later titled Footsteps in the Fog (1955). Lady Godiva of Coventry (1955) was a period swashbuckler with Maureen O'Hara. It featured a young Clint Eastwood who Lubin had put under personal contract. Eastwood had a larger role in Francis in the Navy (1955), Lubin's last Francis movie; both he and star Donald O'Connor elected not to appear in Francis in the Haunted House (1956). Lubin then was let go by Universal; the directed later blamed this on the failure of Lady Godiva.Davis, p. 184. Later films and television Eastwood was given another support role in two films Lubin made for his own company released through RKO, The First Traveling Saleslady (1956) and Escapade in Japan (1957). In May 1956 Lubin signed an exclusive three-year deal with Lubin. Television In the late 1950s, Lubin got involved in television. He directed episodic TV shows like Bronco (1958), Maverick (1959), Bonanza (1960), and The Addams Family (1965). Mr Ed His best known work was Mister Ed. Lubin had wanted to make a TV series based on Francis but was not able to secure the rights. Instead he optioned a series of short stories about a talking horse, Mr Ed, back in 1957. The pilot was financed by comedian George Burns, but Lubin was unable to sell it to a network. He decided to sell the show into syndication first, got a sponsor and managed to finance 26 episodes until the show was picked up by CBS. The show ran for six seasons and 143 episodes. Star Alan Young recalled the producer-director: > He was a very lovable character, but he was a character. He wanted to rush > through and get things done quickly, and he didn't want to stay around the > studio too long. I'll never forget one line he used. He didn't like people > fooling around on the set, cracking jokes. He really didn't have a great > sense of humor for a man who did so many comedies! I'll never forget when he > said: \\"Stop that! Stop all this laughing! This is comedy, there's no time > for laughter!\\" Well, we just all broke up. He didn't realize what he said, > he didn't care. As a longtime friend of Mae West, Lubin got her to appear on an episode of Mister Ed. He directed the occasional feature, such as The Thief of Baghdad (1961), The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964) (with Don Knotts and Hold On! (1966) (with Herman's Hermits). Peter Noone who appeared in the latter remembers, \\"Arthur Lubin was really talented. He made us better than we actually were, which is what a good director does. I mean, this band was not exactly ready for Stanislavski.\\" Lubin's last feature was Rain for a Dusty Summer (1971). His last work was the 1978 Little Lulu TV special on ABC Weekend Special. Lubin's career ended in the late 1970s. Personal life Lubin was gay and for many years lived with Frank Buford. Death He died at the Autumn Hills nursing home in Glendale, California on May 12, 1995 at age 96. Hospital worker and serial killer Efren Saldivar allegedly told people he killed dozens of sick and elderly patients; there was some fear that Lubin was one of these. Appraisal Lubin said he directed 69 films of which \\"eight have been miserable flops\\".Flynn & McCarthy p 364 These included Mickey the Kid and Yellowstone, Filmography=As director or producer * A Successful Failure (1934) * Great God Gold (1935) * Honeymoon Limited (1935) * Two Sinners (1935) * Frisco Waterfront (1935) * The House of a Thousand Candles (1936) * Yellowstone (1936) * Mysterious Crossing (1936) * California Straight Ahead!

Thetimes.co.uk, Accessed 27 October 2014BFI. Web.archive.org, Accessed 27 October 2014 Overview Born into a Jewish family in London's East End, he joined the British Army at the age of 14 as a band boy, and as a result of his natural ability was sponsored by the Army to study at the Royal College of Music. He is the younger brother of Terry Burns (born Mark Sager) the medical inventor and picture restorer. There is also a half-brother, Edward Tunnicliff (born Edward Sager), who now lives in North Norfolk. Sidney Sager's musical career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he fought with the British Expeditionary Force in France and was evacuated from Dunkirk. Following a brief spell in England he was transferred to North Africa, where he served from 1941 to 1945. He left the army in 1945 and returned to civilian life as a musician, playing brass for some time for the Royal Opera at Covent Garden. During the 1950s he studied composition and conducting in Geneva, and shortly after his return to the UK moved to Bristol, where he conducted the BBC West of England Light Orchestra and founded the Paragon, the City of Bristol's first symphony orchestra, which subsequently reformed as Bristol Sinfonia. He was involved for many years with the BBC Wildlife Unit at Bristol and also wrote the music for many programmes for HTV West.

This work was scored for string quintet modelled after Schubert. He also composed orchestral, band and choral works for festivals, often with children's themes (much like his television scores). In 1960 he wrote the score for Delilah The Sensitive Cow, a story written and narrated by his friend Johnny Morris, the television presenter, which was released as a record by Decca. Children of the Stones For Children of the Stones, Sager's combination of a cappella vocalizations fixated on a single, repeated Icelandic word (\\"Hadave\\"), along with its dissonant wordless counterpoint, made this score unique among children's programming. The vocals were provided by the Ambrosian Singers, featuring Lynda Richardson on the solo soprano line. The vocals were supplemented by electric guitar, bass guitar and percussion. The main theme of Children of the Stones is written on the acoustic scale, ambiguously fluctuating between a tonality of C and D major. A signature two-chord harmonic progression, Em9 to G/C, is heard throughout the seven-part series at key dramatic points. A secondary theme is treated in canon and is diegetic music, representing a hymn sung by the spellbound villagers in the story. This theme is later echoed in the guitar and bass when the main child protagonist, Matt, uses his latent psychometric abilities. The secondary theme also concludes the series in a light jazz arrangement, establishing a lighter tone before the final twist is revealed. The musical texture was the suggestion of producer Peter Graham Scott, who, while driving to Avebury to begin filming, had heard music by Krzysztof Penderecki on the radio.

In 1931 he converted it to a joint stock company, Ba≈•a a.s., still based in Zl√≠n, former Czechoslovakia. Bata's administration began in May 1931. He implemented new growth plans for the Ba≈•a businesses at the height of the Great Depression. His efforts included expansion into new industries, including: shoe production machinery, tires, textiles, chemicals, mines, canals, a railway, film studios, manufacture of airplanes and bicycles, development of retail department stores, import/export. At the time when Bat'a became owner and chief executive officer, the Ba≈•a organization employed 16,560 co-workers that maintained 1,645 shops and 25 enterprises. Most of it was located in Czech lands (15,770 employees, 1,500 shops, 25 enterprises) and Slovakia (2 enterprises, 250 employees). The international businesses of the Ba≈•a company consisted of 790 employees, 132 shops, and 20 international enterprises. During his period, the Moravian and Czech part of the business more than doubled its size to 38,000 co-workers, 2,200 shops, and 70 enterprises. The Slovak enterprises also expanded exponentially in Slovakia from 250 people to 12,340 and 8 enterprises. In 1939 when Czechoslovakia was annexed by Nazi Germany, Bat'a unsuccessfully tried to negotiate with the German authorities in order to prevent the control of his company from being taken over by the German army. With his family he went into exile to the United States. In 1941 he was blacklisted for having entered into negotiations with the Nazis and was exiled again, settling finally in Brazil. There he founded several company industrial towns, including: Bataipor√£, Bataguassu, Batatuba, Anauril√¢ndia and Mari√°polis, communities where more than 100,000 people live today. Up to his death, Bat'a expanded the organization more than sixfold from the date of purchase. From 1931 to 1942, the Bata organization grew to 105,770 employees. The Ba≈•avilles were new cities, new industrial communities, each with a specialized purpose, based on the \\"ideal city\\" model. In 1935 Jan Bat'a proposed a contest for ideal city designs. \\"In 1935, [Jan] Bata invited Le Corbusier to Zlin as a member of the jury of Bata's International Housing Competition and for consultations over the factory city plans.\\" The way Bata introduced the Ideal city concept was based on an architectural design competition.

The strategy may also involve the imposition of obstacles or additional costs to certain courses of action in advance. As theorized by the social scientist Jon Elster, an agent may precommit herself when she predicts that her preferences will change but wishes to ensure that her future actions will align with her current preferences. Precommitment has also been studied as a bargaining strategy in which agents bind themselves to one course of action in order to enhance the credibility of present threats. Some scholars have proposed that collective political agents may also engage in precommitment by adopting constitutions that limit the scope of future legislation.e.g. Stephen Holmes, \\"Precommitment and the paradox of democracy,\\" in Constitutionalism and Democracy, eds. John Elster and Rune Slagstad (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 195-240. The validity of this application of precommitment theory has been called into question, however.  Background  In two unrelated articles, both published in 1956, Thomas Schelling and R.H. Strotz introduced the concept of precommitment to the study of strategic bargaining and consumer behavior, respectively. Schelling later included an expanded version of this essay in his 1960 work The Strategy of Conflict. The economist has explained precommitment as part of his deterrence theory, where the concept is said to influence other parties in a bargaining situation. He detailed that a party can exert power over another or achieve more of his aims by adopting rules that restricts available options. Schelling argued that a negotiator may voluntarily limit the options available to him in the future in order to make his current offer or threat more credible. This can also be achieved by voluntarily raising the cost of a future action for oneself, even if that action is not precluded absolutely. Counterintuitively, a negotiator may strengthen his bargaining position by curtailing his freedom of choice. In a classic example, a general may burn the bridges behind his army to preclude the possibility of retreat, thereby increasing the credibility of his threat to stand and fight. In another context, a negotiator may publicly declare her \\"bottom line\\" to increase the reputational costs of making further concessions. By voluntarily altering her incentive structure, the negotiator enhances the credibility of her intransigent posture. In the context of the Cold War, \\"fail-deadly\\" retaliation systems such as the Soviet Dead Hand ensure an automatic response to a sudden attack, regardless of whether or not anyone is left alive to make a decision. Schelling used the terms \\"self- commitment\\" and \\"self-binding,\\" rather than precommitment. R. H. Strotz appealed to precommitment in his exploration of inconsistency in consumer behavior. A consumer might devise a plan that optimally spreads his consumption over time, only to revise or repudiate that plan at a later time in favor of higher immediate consumption. In cases like this, Strotz writes, the consumer \\"finds that he is in an intertemporal tussle with himself.\\" The rational consumer may thus engage in precommitment to guard against future deviations from his optimal consumption plan. The hiring of a personal financial manager is an example of this kind of strategy. Unlike Schelling, Strotz was not concerned with the uses of precommitment in bargaining situations. Rather, for Strotz, precommitment was a strategy which an agent might use to impose his current intentions upon a myopic future self. In the epigraph to his article on the subject, Strotz connects his theory of precommitment to the story of Ulysses and the Sirens from The Odyssey.  Elster's theory  Jon Elster first developed a theory of precommitment, which he also calls self-binding, in his 1979 work Ulysses and the Sirens. Here, he argues that precommitment is a device that human agents use to overcome the problem of imperfect rationality. Human beings are imperfectly rational because they are capable of rational planning but are prone to deviate from these plans because of weakness of will. Recognizing their vulnerability to imperious passions, human agents precommit themselves to \\"[achieve] rationality by indirect means.\\" Elaborating upon Strotz's reference to The Odyssey, Elster takes the story of Ulysses and the Sirens to be a paradigmatic case of precommitment. Indeed, he refers to precommitment as \\"the Ulysses problem.\\" On the basis of a warning from his erstwhile lover Circes, Ulysses instructs his sailors to bind him to the mast of his ship and block their own ears before sailing past the island of the Sirens, whose enchanting song draws sailors to shipwreck. As he commands, Otto Greiner, Odysseus und die Sirenen. > you must bind me with tight chafing ropes so I cannot move a muscle, bound > to the spot, erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast. And if I > plead, commanding you to set me free, then lash me faster, rope on pressing > rope. Thus, foreseeing his own weakness of will, Ulysses guards against the temptation of the Sirens. A more mundane example that Elster uses is that of a smoker who tells her friends about her intention to quit in order to raise the cost of backsliding. Having broadcast her intention to quit, a return to cigarettes would now damage her reputation or, at least, induce snide remarks from her friends. In Ulysses and the Sirens, Elster also applies his theory of precommitment to the domain of politics. Elster starts with the assertion that a direct democracy will tend to reverse its own decisions and to display inconsistent preferences over time. As he puts it, direct democracies are \\"incontinent, vacillating, and inefficient.\\" On this basis, Elster goes on to argue that certain institutions in modern democracies may be considered precommitment devices. A democratic electorate may bind itself as a way of \\"protecting itself against its own impulsiveness.\\" The establishment of central banks, he argues, can be interpreted as an act of precommitment on the part of an electorate seeking to preempt the impulse to meddle with interest rates. Elster argues that a people may similarly bind itself through a constitution that entrusts certain powers to the judiciary and requires supermajorities to change certain clauses. By doing so, the people guards itself against its own irrationality at a future time. This, Elster says, is \\"the Ulysses strategy\\" in domain of politics. Elster elaborates upon his theory of precommitment in his 2000 work Ulysses Unbound. Here, he develops a typology of individual precommitment strategies, drawing on examples from French literature and from contemporary studies of addiction. In the second part of this work, Elster partially repudiates his earlier application of precommitment to the domain of politics. He argues here that constitutions are often devised with the goal of binding others (e.g. future majorities), not their makers.

It was first published in the magazine Blue BookCover, Blue Book April 1935 as a six-part serial in the issues for November 1934 to April 1935. The first book edition was published by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. in February 1936. Plot introduction Swords of Mars begins as a cloak and dagger thriller and ends as an interplanetary odyssey. In this novel John Carter, transplanted Earthman, returns to his status of protagonist and first-person narrator for the first time since the third Martian novel, The Warlord of Mars. Plot summary Carter relates an adventure commencing with a private war he and his picked followers have been waging against the resurgent Guild of Assassins, led by Ur Jan. Hoping to cut off the threat at the root, he travels undercover to the Assassins' base, the restive city of Zodanga, still smarting from its defeat and sack by the Empire of Helium and the horde of Tharks in A Princess of Mars. There Carter passes himself off in the underworld as Vandor, a freelance bravo, cultivating small- time criminal Rapas the Ulsio and attempting to penetrate the ranks of the Guild. Simultaneously, Carter becomes embroiled in the affairs of two rival scientists, Fal Sivas and Gar Nal, who are competing against each other to create a viable \\"synthetic brain\\"-controlled spacecraft. Complications ensue as the two threads of the plot become entangled, and the Guild, in its own attempt at a preemptive strike against Carter, kidnaps his wife, the princess Dejah Thoris of Helium. For the first time the action of the series goes off- planet, as Ur Jan and Gar Nal flee with Dejah to the Martian moon Thuria (Phobos) in one of the spacecraft, pursued by Carter and his allies Jat Or and Zanda in the other. The passage shrinks the travelers down until to them the tiny moon is the size of a planet. There, all are captured by the sun- worshipping Tarids, white-skinned and blue-haired natives of Thuria (which they call Ladan) whose mental powers render them invisible to the spacefarers. To win freedom from their jeweled prison, the antagonists must join forces with each other, aided by another captive, the one-eyed and two-mouthed chameleon-like \\"cat-man\\" Umka. Amid betrayal and heroic sacrifice, the parties from Mars eventually return to their home planet with Carter and Dejah still separated and the latter believed still captive on Thuria. In a final twist, she is revealed as still in the hands of Gar Nal, whom Ur Jan, honoring his earlier pledge of fealty to Carter, redeems himself by dispatching. Hidden dedication The first letter of the preface and the subsequent twenty-four chapters of the book form an acrostic message from the author to his second wife Florence, whom he was in the process of marrying at the time of publication.

It houses the main office of the executive branch and is located in the capital city of Bogot√°, Colombia. It was dedicated in 1908 after being constructed on the site of the house where Antonio Nari√±o was born. The design was made by architects Gaston Lelarge, a French-born former pupil of Charles Garnier, and Juli√°n Lombana. In 1980, the structure was rededicated after the construction of additions. The building also houses works of art and furnishings from different periods of the history of art. Its garden houses the Observatorio Astron√≥mico de Bogot√°, designed by the Capuchin friar-architect Domingo de Petr√©s and built in 1802-03. Changing the Guard, cambio de guardia in the Plaza de Armas History The grand house, located halfway along the first Carrera Street, was bought by Don Vicente Nari√±o in 1754 for 5,200 ‚Äúpatacones‚Äù. There Vicente Nari√±o and Catalina √Ålvarez lived with their children for approximately 30 years, until Nari√±o died. It was then when his wife and children received it in inheritance according to Nari√±o's will in 1778. Nari√±o's portrait in the presidential office. On April 9, 1765, the third of the eight children of the Nari√±o family was born, Antonio Nari√±o y √Ålvarez, one of the Colombian Independence's national heroes. After the Nari√±o family, the property was acquired by a number of owners, including the daughter of the former administrator of the Colombian Mint, Do√±a Juana In√©s Prieto y Ricaurte. The first presidential palace from where Sim√≥n Bolivar worked after Colombian Independence was the old viceregal palace (Palacio de los Virreyes), located in the west side of Bolivar square of Bogot√° in the current position of the Palacio L√≠evano. On November 16, 1827 one of the most intense earthquakes of the city's history took place, this left the palace partially destroyed. Because of this, Simon Bol√≠var authorized the purchase of the San Carlos Palace from Juan Manuel Arrubla, and the transfer of the presidential office and the official residence to that property. On October 23, 1885, President Rafael N√∫√±ez, purchased the Nari√±o house in order to convert it into a presidential palace in observance of its beauty, significance in history, and its proximity to the National Capitol. The presidents stayed there until 1892, during the periods of Rafael Nu√±ez and Carlos Holguin Mallarino, and under the temporary government of the Generals Eliseo Pay√°n and Jos√© Mar√≠a Campo Serrano. Subsequently, the presidential residence was moved again to the San Carlos Palace, while the Nari√±o house was used as headquarters of the War Ministry, the National Archive, and the National University's faculty of Mathematics. On April 9, 1906, the General Rafael Reyes hired the French architect, Gast√≥n Lelarge, and a local one, Juli√°n Lombana to demolish parts and rebuild the former house. The architects extended the dimensions of the property to Eighth Road and restructured the inner part of the building by creating two levels. They also designed wide halls and improved the fa√ßade with carved stones. The complete ornamentation works were carried out by the Swiss sculptor Luigi Ramelli. On July 20, 1908 the government building was officially returned to the Casa de Nari√±o or Palace of the Carrera (Palacio de la Carrera). During the government of Eduardo Santos the third level and the terrace roof were built, along with a heliport. The government office remained in the Casa de Nari√±o until 1954, when the General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla commanded it to be moved to the chancellery and the presidency came back to the San Carlos Palace. . Remodeling In 1972 an extension and a remodeling of the building were proposed, these changes were made during the presidency of Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen, between 1974 and 1978 . the remodeling works kept the seventh Carrera fa√ßade in its original form, but the remaining parts of the building were redesigned including the gardens, the National Observatory, the Plaza de Armas (Parades Square), the neoclassical style portico and the west wing that left the palace totally isolated from the other buildings. The restoration works were carried out by the architect Fernando Alsina, who was an auditor of the Ministry of public works. In order to make a complete restoration and extension of the palace it was necessary to demolish some nearby buildings such as the house of the Botanical Expedition, the mail administration and the house of Camilo Torres, among others. The total cost of the works was 250 million Colombian pesos. . $ 1000 issued in 1979 showing the image of the Casa de Nari√±o. During this epoch a good number of buildings near to the Casa de Nari√±o were declared as 'National Monuments of Colombia', including the Astronomic Observatory, the National Capitol, The Echeverri Palace, The Church of San Agustin, the Claustro de San Agustin, the Church of Santa Clara, the college of San Bartolom√©, Bol√≠var Square and the historic sector of La Candelaria. To move the presidency back to the Casa de Nari√±o took around ten months between 1979 and 1980 and its re-inauguration was made during the government of Julio C√©sar Turbay. On April 1, 1979, the bank of the Republic launched to the market the first series of 1000 pesos bills portraying the image of the Casa de Nari√±o in the seal. On December 11, 1979 the first broadcast of coloured television in Colombian was made with a speech by the former president Turbay followed by images of the new fa√ßade of the palace. During the inauguration of √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez on 7 August 2002, a homemade rocket crashed into the west fa√ßade's cornice and three soldiers were injured as well as 13 people being killed as a result of terrorist attacks all over the city. The consequences of the impact were not major and were rapidly repaired, but because of that the security had to be increased in the zone . On March 9, 2007 the robbery of the picture of ‚ÄúEl C√≥ndor‚Äù was reported. It was painted in 1971 by the master Alejandro Obreg√≥n and normally decorated the ministry council room in the palace. A few hours later it was discovered that a sergeant belonging to the presidential security body had stolen it and that the picture was stored in a house in the neighborhood, San Victorino, from where it was recovered. Urban context The Casa de Nari√±o is located on Seventh Street (Calle S√©ptima) between Seventh Avenue (Av. Carrera S√©ptima) and Eighth Road (Carrera Octava), in the historical sector of La Candelaria. The south side of the house connects to the church of San Agustin and the Ministry of Finance building as well as the statue of Antonio Jos√© de Sucre. Seventh Street was made following the original riverbed direction of the San Agustin River that used to pass behind the Casa de Nari√±o. The riverbed was altered in 1909 and covered by Calle S√©ptima in 1979. With the expansion of the street the Sucre monument had to be relocated to the Ayacucho Square on the east side of the Casa de Nari√±o. On the eastern side of Seventh Road is the Casa Republicana (Spanish for Republican House), the former Imperial Hotel, Ayacucho Square and The Presidential Administrative Building. On the west side of Eighth Street (Carrera Octava) is the Claustro de San Agustin and the Vice presidency building, both of them were built on the places where Camilo Torres‚Äô house and the Office of the Botanical Expedition used to be. On the north side of the Casa de Nari√±o, and in front of the neoclassical \\"p√≥rtico\\", is the Plaza de Armas (Weapons Square), Antonio Nari√±o's statue and the Patio de Rafael Nu√±ez, which faces the National Capitol directly, and was built between 1847 and 1926. Description Antonio Nari√±o's statue on Palace of Nari√±o On the north side of the palace, is the Plaza de Armas (Parade Square), a place where foreign guests are received with military honors. On the north side of this square are two sculptures: A replica of the pre- Columbian anthropomorphic stone sculpture called ‚ÄúEl dios de la muerte‚Äù (Spanish for the God of Death), whose original can be found in the San Agustin Archaeological Park, and also, a sculpture by √âdgar Negret in 1979 titled ‚ÄúVigilantes‚Äù, it is composed of 10 red bent aluminum plates and is dedicated to love and feelings. On the west side of the square are the fountain and the flagpole. Plaza de Armas of the palace. On the west side of the Plaza de Armas is the National Observatory designed and built by the Capuchin architect brother Domingo de Petr√©s between March 24, 1802 and August 20, 1803, and whose first director was Jos√© Celestino Mutis. The Observatory is the oldest in America and there the leaders of the first conspiracy movements reunited to plan the revolution of July 20, the first step to Colombian independence. Currently, the observatory is part of the National University. On the Plaza de Armas the traditional Cambio de Guardia del Palacio (Changing of the Palace Guard) is carried out every day by the 37th Infantry Battalion, (Presidential Guard Battalion). This military parade is one of the most famous acts performed on the Plaza de Armas, because the whole battalion reunites to do it. In front of the Plaza de Armas and the Patio de Rafael Nu√±ez, is a statue of Antonio Nari√±o by the French sculptor Henri-L√©on Gr√©ber made in 1910 and was relocated on July 19, 1980. First Floor In the main entrance is the Pasillo de las Banderas (Hall of flags), where the flags of the Military Forces of Colombia are located as follows: the flags of the Colombian Air Force, Colombian Navy, Colombian National Police and the flag of the central command in the center. In front of the military flags are the flags of Cartagena, Cundinamarca, Spain, the one created by Francisco de Miranda for the United Provinces of New Granada and the flag of July 20 (currently the flag of Bogot√°). After the hall of flags there is another room called the Bargue√±os Room or the Baules Room (Hall of trunks), that serves as a waiting room for visitors.

Fishing from rocks is usually called rock fishing. Like rock fishing, bank fishing is typically done by casting fishing bait or lures into the water in an attempt to catch fish. Bank fishing is usually performed with a rod and reel but nets, traps, and spears, and fishing lines used without rods can also be used. People who fish from a boat can sometimes access more areas in prime locations with greater ease than bank fishermen. However, many people who don't use boats find fishing from a bank has its own advantages. Many factors contribute to success in bank fishing, such as local knowledge, water depth, bank structure, location, time of day, and the types of bait and lures.  Equipment  Fisherman have different preferences about the equipment they use for bank fishing, but most agree on the basics. Obviously fishing tackle is needed. Most bank fishing is performed with a rod, reel and lures or bait. Often two fishing rods are used. The bait can be changed on one rod while fishing continues with the other. Some fishermen bring a lidded container for the fish they catch which doubles as a seat. Other fishermen bring a stringer to hold the fish they catch. Catch and release fishermen don't need either of these. With advancing technology, some luxury equipment has been developed such as the fish finder that uses sonar or a camera to physically locate fish. This is typically reserved for boat fishing but can also be applied to bank fishing.  Advantages  Some fishermen, and even professional anglers, find advantages in fishing from a bank. According to professional angler Joseph Raines, ‚ÄúI've bass fished from the bank most of my life, and have had tremendous success. I have caught all of my 7lb. plus bass from the bank. I recently caught a twelve pound bass right on the bank.\\"Joseph Raines, Bank fishing Bank fishing requires the fisherman to scout and locate prime fishing locations. Some anglers view this as an advantage because it sharpens their skills by forcing them to pay close attention to important details that boating anglers may miss. Bank fishing can also allow a person to reach areas that a boat can't, such as shallow or densely covered areas that might be tricky for a boat. Bank fishing can also allow the fisherman to avoid the costs involved in owning a boat.  Disadvantages  Compared to bank fishing, boat fishing provides access to prime areas with greater ease and speed. Also, bank fishing doesn't allow access to fishing areas that are too far away from the bank. Boat fishing allows fishing for deep water fish, such as lake trout, that may be impossible for bank fishermen to catch. A boat also allows fishing methods not available to bank fishermen such as trolling, deep water jigging, or down rigger fishing.  Considerations  There are many things to take into consideration during and before bank fishing, and many of them depend on the type of fish you are fishing for. An important point to think about is the structure of the bank. Is it rocky, grassy, woody, or sandy. Different fish prefer different structure types. Also look at the surroundings on the bank. It may be an open area with no cover or it may be densely covered with trees. The surroundings could play a key role in providing shade (or not) which is important because it regulates water temperature and the viewpoint of the fish. Also look around at the surroundings for footprints, debris, broken branches and any other signs that other fishermen have been there. This may be a sign that the area has been over-fished which might reduce your chances of a good catch. One should even consider the minute things that might be easily overlooked. Pack lightly. When fishing from the bank you won't want to carry a large load. Blend into your surroundings. Fish are able to see things through the water that may seem out of the ordinary and might spook them. Remember to be quiet near the water and minimize the amount of noise made with the bank which could also spook the fish. Finally, a rule of thumb is to use no longer than a 6-foot pole when fishing near trees or brush to minimize getting hooked on branches.

S000843 Early and family life Born near Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1810, to Daniel Steenrod of New York and his second wife, the former Nancy Ann Gater, who had married in 1806, Lewis Steenrod had seven siblings, including an older brother Edward Gater Steenrod, and elder sisters Catherine and Emma. His sister Mary married the Wheeling postmaster, General Feeney, and their daughter Ann Elizabeth married Congressman and judge George W. Thompson, with whom this Lewis would later work. His father Daniel Steenrod and Col. Moses Shepherd were responsible for building and repairing bridges on the National Road, which had been authorized in 1806 and was completed through Ohio County in 1817-1818, Daniel Steenrod also operated a tavern on the south side of the road, and after Virginia took over responsibility for toll collecting and upkeep, he was still contracting to repair and maintain the road and bridges. In the mid-1830s he also laid out the village of Fulton, and also platted an area called \\"Steenrod's Island\\" around a paper mill constructed by Alexander Armstrong in 1836.NRIS p. 6 Lewis Steenrod attended private schools as a child, then read law.

In 1860, Lewis Steenrod owned $8000 in real property, and $23,000 in personal property, including slaves (his father owned $150,000 in real estate and $10,000 in personal property and his deaf younger brother George owned $600 in real estate and $5,500 in personal property in nearby Triadelphia, and also had married and had two young sons (Lewis and Daniel) and two daughters (Margaret and Elizabeth)1860 U.S. Federal Census for Ohio county Virginia; the corresponding slave schedule shows Daniel as owning six slaves (a forty year old female and children) and Lewis Steenrod only two female slaves, so they may have rented out others. Career Admitted to the Virginia bar in 1835, Steenrod began his practice in Wheeling, the county seat of Ohio County. In 1838 as the Democratic candidate, Steenrod defeated incumbent Whig Richard W. Barton, and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1839 to 1845.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library) p. xxvii. He served on the Committee on Roads and Canals as well as Committee on Revolutionary Pensions. He introduced a bill to authorized a bridge across the Ohio River, which would supplant a partial bridge and ferry service between two major sections of the National Road. While the Wheeling Suspension Bridge was completed before that particular legislation passed, a similar bill passed in 1854 and allowed the bridge to remain despite the great displeasure of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania interests which twice litigated the matter to the United States Supreme Court) because the new bridge interfered with increasingly high steamboat smokestacks. In part to counteract the initial unfavorable Supreme Court decision, voters elected Steenrod to represent Ohio, Brooke and Hancock Counties in the Virginia Senate from 1853 to 1856, which passed a law favoring the bridge.Leonard pp. 457, 463 Afterwards, Steenrod resumed practicing law. However, his outspoken secessionist views (possibly as the result of opposition to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad which reduced traffic on the National Road), caused the Steenrod brothers to be placed under house arrest during the American Civil War. Death and legacy Lewis Steenrod died of tuberculosis at his home near Wheeling, West Virginia on October 3, 1862, and his father two years later. He was interred in Stone Church Cemetery in Elm Grove, West Virginia.Find a Grave No. 7617800}} His nephew and namesake became Ohio County sheriff. Steenrod Avenue in Wheeling is named to recognize the family's contributions. Steenrod Elementary School completed in 1919 was named for his father, on land he owned at his death (with an estate worth $200,000), but has now been supplanted by Triadelphia Middle School. The former family home near Wheeling, known as Woodridge was transferred to his brother George W. Steenrod and his wife, but sold in 1874 (after the Panic of 1873) to his brother-in-law Judge George W. Thompson and his wife to pay off debts. In 1880, George Steenrod's daughter Maggie and her husband Platoff Zane owned it, and had many foster children (though none of their own).

Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2002. p. 185. was a silent film comedy actress from New York City. She was the mother of actress Yvonne Howell. Biography Early reviews of her movies describe her as \\"the scream of the screen\\". One reviewer likened her to a \\"sort of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and Max Linder.\\" All this was compressed into \\"one more or less diminutive package of femininity\\". Sometimes called \\"the girl Charlie Chaplin\\", she worked for Mack Sennett and later L-KO Kompany. Her early comedies were often produced by Universal Pictures.  Career  At Mack Sennett‚Äôs Keystone Film Company, Howell quickly worked her way up from crowd scenes to featured parts in shorts such as Charlie Chaplin‚Äôs Laughing Gas (1914 film), and starred in at least one, Shot in the Excitement (1914). Hired away by Sennett‚Äôs former second-in-command, Henry Lehrman, when he set up the L-KO Kompany, Howell was cast to support Billie Ritchie and became popular in her own one-reelers. By 1917, she was such an audience favorite that Julius and Abe Stern formed Century Comedies to showcase her talents, making her, along with Mabel Normand and Marie Dressler, the third comedienne to have her own exclusive production unit. After Howell and Century parted ways in 1919, the company continued turning out comedy shorts and was renamed Stern Brothers Comedies in 1926. in 1919, Howell moved to the independent Emerald Company, which became part of the Reelcraft Corporation and released her still extant film, Distilled Love (1920). Howell‚Äôs last starring series was a group of 1924‚Äì25 domestic comedies for Universal Pictures featuring a married couple and their goofy butler. When this series ended, she appeared in one last short, Madame Dynamite (1926), for Fox Film Corporation. Among more than 100 screen credits, Howell made such motion pictures as Caught in a Cabaret (1914), Mabel and Fatty's Married Life (1915), Neptune's Naughty Daughter (1917), Green Trees (1924), and Madame Dynamite (1926). Her Bareback Career (1917) was the first of 12 two-reel comedies for a new corporation which was formed to manufacture and distribute Alice Howell comedies. In this era, such female slapstick stars as Howell, Dorothy Devore, and Billie Rhodes were inhibited by second-rate films and the absence of genuine star buildup. Howell's film career continued into the sound-movie era with a role as a mute servant of the master murderer in the motion picture The Black Ace (1933). Alice Howell died in Los Angeles, California, in 1961, aged 74.

He is most widely known for his role as guitarist and vocalist for the post-metal bands SUMAC and Isis, while also participating in several other bands and projects such as Old Man Gloom, Lotus Eaters and Split Cranium, a collaboration with Jussi Lehtisalo of Finnish band Circle who toured with Isis in 2009. Though raised in New Mexico, Turner moved to the Boston area where he attended school and formed Isis and Hydra Head. In June 2003, Turner moved operations of both the band and label to Los Angeles, California. Turner now resides in Vashon, WA which is also the base of operations for Hydra Head and his various other activities. In partnership with his wife Faith Coloccia, Turner founded another record label, SIGE, in March 2011. It has gone on to release material from his musical collaboration with Coloccia, Mamiffer. SIGE is distributed by The Business.  Personal life  Turner was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on November 5, 1977. At an early age, his family moved to New Mexico, where he was raised. His mother was a teacher \\"who taught a progressive curriculum\\" and his father an author, \\"mainly [of] non-fiction\\". Turner describes his upbringing, surrounded by his parents' writer, artist and photographer friends, as \\"creatively nurturing\\". At age 17, he started a company that sold rare punk rock records via mail-order. He later moved to Boston to attend art school at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, and in 1995 began releasing music. By 1997, the Hydra Head label was becoming a respectable small record label. Turner describes his early industriousness as being motivated in part by boredom: > I grew up in New Mexico, and there wasn't a whole lot as far as youth > culture is concerned. Especially when I started to get interested in > straight edge and wasn't doing drugs anymore, there was really nothing for > me to do. So that was like a big reason for me, I suppose, to become really > productive. Also, I've never been a really social person. So there's not a > lot of time taken up by my social life. And music has always been a very > very big part of my life. I guess just a combination of those factors is why > everything got started so early. Around 1997‚Äì99, Turner was living with future Isis bassist and co-founder Jeff Caxide; until this point, he had been a member of the bands Union Suit and Hollomen. Isis was formed in 1997 out of a dissatisfaction with said bands' musical direction and Turner and Caxide's respective degrees of creative control. In mid-2009, Turner moved from Los Angeles, where both Isis and Hydra Head Records were based at the time, to Seattle with his then-girlfriend, Faith Coloccia; they went on to wed in September of the same year.  Equipment  Touring with Isis in 2007, Turner used two different guitars: a 1976 Fender Telecaster Custom (black), and a 1975 Fender Telecaster Deluxe (brown), played through various effects (his pedalboard layout changed every gig depending on what songs the band decided to play that night), a VHT/Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, and two 4x12 Sunn cabinets. He has also acquired a custom guitar from the Electrical Guitar Company (as did fellow Isis guitarist Michael Gallagher). In the past, Turner has also used a Gibson Les Paul Standard, PRS CE24, and has played through Sunn, Mesa Boogie, and Mackie amplifiers. When playing with Isis, Turner and his fellow guitarists usually tuned their instruments (low to high) B-F#-B-E-G#-B, to achieve a heavier sound. They also used other tunings, though less frequently, such as F# (octave below)-F#-B-E-G#-B. In 2016, Turner described the live rig he used with SUMAC as consisting of two custom-built guitars from the Electrical Guitar Company. Both have lucite bodies and aluminum necks, and custom-wound wide frequency range pickups. The newer of the two‚Äîa prototype for a signature model‚Äîhas a slightly flatter fingerboard radius than the older instrument. On a tour of the Eastern US, Turner was using an Orange Dual Dark 100 amplifier head with a slaved Fryette Two/Ninety/Two power amp. Both heads drove Orange and Marshall cabinets, though Turner claimed to have no strong preferences for particular speaker cabinets. While recording, Turner prefers to use a Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, an amp model he's used consistently since his work in Isis. Turner described using a variety of effects pedals in his live rig. Specifically, he runs a BOSS TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, a Death By Audio Apocalypse fuzz, a MASF fuzz, a Strymon BlueSky reverb (which he described as the one essential pedal in his rig), a TC Electronics Ditto Looper X2, and an EHX Forty-Five Thousand sampler (used to trigger preset samples during performance. Turner prefers a Heil PR20 vocal microphone. When playing with Sumac he uses two distinct tunings being A-F#-B-D-F#-B and A#-F-A#-D-F#-A#.  Musical influences  Turner cites Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Godflesh, Neurosis, and Led Zeppelin as influences on Isis' sound. However, he points to the electronica, krautrock and hip hop genres as shaping the group's rhythmic focus and use of sampling, as well as their occasional digressions into ambient passages. He has also listed Melvins, Jimi Hendrix, Swans, Keiji Haino, Oxbow, Earth, and Coil as among his favorite artists, and has noted that Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer were important to his early interests in the guitar. In addition, he has noted Black Sabbath as an influence during his formative years.  Discography  Performing live in Colchester, UK, in 2004.

His work on album covers, concert posters, and other music-related graphics is distinct from typical work in heavy metal or rock graphic design. In part, this may be because of the way that Turner views his objectives in creating designs, which he has discussed on his blog in response to criticism of the clarity of text on one of his concert posters: > I also generally reject the idea that posters and album sleeves and t shirts > have to be marketing tools with overly obvious type/graphics, as opposed to > more artistically oriented pieces that invoke the true spirit of the music > they are intended to represent. if the bands being represented aren't > writing 3 minute pop songs with inane choruses that beat the listener into > submission, why should the representative graphics serve that purpose? i > like to think the audience that follows these bands isn't the type of > audience that requires overly simplified/commercial imagery and type in > order to draw their attention to the \\"product\\". it is precisely the type of > corporate design mentality as exemplified by the statement above that i have > striven to avoid with what i do in the realm of music related graphics. > we're not trying to sell our music to wal-mart shoppers, so if you expect > our graphic personality to fall in line with what you were taught in design > school about corporate branding and \\"truly effective\\" type and illustration > techniques you shall be continually disappointed. clean type has its time > and place, but this poster which is meant to showcase the personality of our > label and by extension the show itself isn't it. music related design can be > art simply beyond the idea of selling something... In 2008, Turner's artwork was featured in a FIFTY24SF Gallery group show entitled Catalyst. Turner has created album covers and liner note artwork for a variety of artists and bands, many of whom are signed to Hydra Head Records or Tortuga Recordings. * 27 ‚Äì Let the Light In * 5ive ‚Äì 5ive, Telestic Disfracture * Aereogramme ‚Äì Seclusion * Agoraphobic Nosebleed ‚Äì PCP Torpedo, Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope * A Life Once Lost ‚Äì The Fourth Plague: Flies * Beecher ‚Äì Breaking the Fourth Wall * Bloodlet ‚Äì Entheogen * Burst ‚Äì Prey on Life * Cable ‚Äì Northern Failures * Cave In ‚Äì Antenna, Planets of Old, White Silence * Cavity ‚Äì Laid Insignificant * Clouds ‚Äì We Are Above You * Coalesce ‚Äì There is Nothing New Under the Sun * Converge ‚Äì Petitioning the Empty Sky, When Forever Comes Crashing * Craw ‚Äì Bodies for Strontium 90 * The Dillinger Escape Plan ‚Äì The Dillinger Escape Plan * Drowningman ‚Äì Drowningman Still Loves You * The Dukes of Nothing ‚Äì War & Wine * Eugene Robinson ‚Äì Fight * Hematovore ‚Äì Untitled * The Hollomen ‚Äì The Hollomen * The Hope conspiracy ‚Äì demo * Isis ‚Äì Mosquito Control, The Red Sea, Sawblade, Celestial, SGNL>05, Oceanic, Live.01, Panopticon, Live.02, Oceanic Remixes and Reinterpretations, Live.03, Live.04, Clearing the Eye, In the Absence of Truth, Shades of the Swarm, \\"Not in Rivers, but in Drops\\", Wavering Radiant, Isis / Melvins * James Plotkin's Atomsmasher ‚Äì Atomsmasher * Jesu ‚Äì Silver, Lifeline, Conqueror, Jesu, Why Are We Not Perfect? * Jodis ‚Äì Secret House * Johnny Truant ‚Äì The Repercussions of a Badly Planned Suicide * KEN mode ‚Äì Mongrel * Kid Kilowatt ‚Äì Guitar Method * Knut ‚Äì Terraformer, Wonder * Mare ‚Äì Self-Titled EP * Milligram ‚Äì Hello Motherfucker * Mistle Thrush ‚Äì Drunk with You * Neurosis ‚Äì Sovereign, Neurosis & Jarboe (remastered) * Old Man Gloom ‚Äì Meditations in B, Seminar II: The Holy Rites of Primitivism Regressionism, NO * Panic ‚Äì Dying For It * Pelican ‚Äì Australasia, The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw, City of Echoes * Premonitions of War ‚Äì Left in Kowloon * Rosetta ‚Äì The Galilean Satellites * Torche ‚Äì Meanderthal * Tusk ‚Äì Get Ready * Xasthur ‚Äì All Reflections Drained * Zozobra ‚Äì Harmonic Tremors, Bird of Prey  References  ;Footnotes ;Citations 1977 births Living people Isis (band) members American graphic designers American heavy metal guitarists American heavy metal singers American experimental musicians Shoegazing musicians Guitarists from New Mexico People from Santa Fe, New Mexico American male guitarists 21st-century American singers Old Man Gloom members ","title":"Aaron Turner"},{"id":"9545838","text":"Photo from 1901 showing buildings in New Inn Passage, Houghton Street, then called the Clare Market Slum, which was demolished as part of the Kingsway‚ÄìAldwych Improvement scheme in 1905.A shop in Clare Market slum, Westminster - photograph Clare Market is a historic area in central London located within the parish of St Clement Danes to the west of Lincoln's Inn Fields, between the Strand and Drury Lane, with Vere Street adjoining its western side. It was named after the food market which had been established in Clement's Inn Fields, by John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare. Much of the area and its landmarks were immortalised by Charles Dickens in The Old Curiosity Shop, The Pickwick Papers, Barnaby Rudge and Sketches by Boz. The historic district includes large parts of the London School of Economics (LSE) and several academic buildings on the site bear the area's name. The name of the area is also commemorated in the name of the oldest student journal in the UK, the Clare Market Review, which is published by the LSE. The former Director of the London School of Economics, Ralf Dahrendorf, Lord Dahrendorf, chose the official title \\"Baron Dahrendorf, of Clare Market in the City of Westminster\\" when he was made a life peer in 1993.  History  The Old Curiosity Shop in Clare Market claims to be the inspiration for Charles Dickens's description of the eponymous antique shop Clare Market was originally centred on a small market building constructed by Lord Clare in 1657, but the retail area spread through a maze of narrow interconnecting streets lined by butchers' shops and greengrocers. Butchers would slaughter sheep and cattle for sale. An area was set aside for Jews to slaughter kosher meat. The area was not affected by the Great Fire of London, and the decrepit Elizabethan buildings survived until the area, by then a slum, was redeveloped by the London County Council in around 1905 to create the Aldwych and Kingsway. The market mostly sold meat, although fish and vegetables were also sold. An early theatre was in Gibbon's Tennis Court, in the Clare Market area. A club of artists, including William Hogarth, met at the Bull's Head Tavern in the market.  London School of Economics  London School of Economics (New Academic Building) Parts of the London School of Economics now occupy the site, and the name of the area is commemorated in an academic journal published by the university, titled Clare Market Review, which has evolved into an academic journal for the social sciences. One former Director of the LSE, Ralf Dahrendorf, chose the official title \\"Baron Dahrendorf of Clare Market\\" when he was made a life peer in 1993. This tradition of honouring Clare Market has stuck and become popular over time with LSE alumni. One of the main buildings at the centre of the LSE Campus was called the Clare Market Building, reflecting the school's links to the historic district. However the building was demolished in 2015, replaced by the Centre Building which opened in June 2019. The Royal Courts of Justice and King's College London are also located near the London School of Economics.

Both selves exist, but do not exist at the same time. Schelling wrote: \\"What I have in mind is an act or decision that a person takes ...[based upon] preferences [that] differ from what they were earlier...If the person could make the final decision about that action at the earlier time, precluding a later change in mind, he would make a different choice ...\\" Schelling suggested a number of strategies for dealing with this issue in his paper, such as precommitment, use of bright line rules, delay tactics, or creating a pre-arranged deal between selves. On similar lines, contrary to Schelling's definition, author Gaurav Madan defines ‚ÄúEgonomics‚Äù as a composite of two terms ‚Äì ‚ÄúEgo‚Äù and ‚Äúomics‚Äù. In his view, Ego means the self-awareness, a part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing, and also a sense of personal identity. However, the suffix ‚Äìomics derives its meaning from biology that means a study in the totality of an entity, which in this case is self. Thus, he suggests ‚ÄúEgonomics‚Äù as a process of developing holistic awareness of ‚Äúawareness‚Äù itself. He further adds, it should not be confused self-perception, self-identity or similar terms. Similar to the work of Schelling, Gaurav affirms that \\"at the core of Egonomics is the idea that within each individual exists two selves: the past or future self and the present self, constantly at odds, leading to a sort of cognitive dissonance between the two. Both selves exist within us and are equally valid, but aren‚Äôt always active at the same time. It‚Äôs a natural and ongoing conflict between immediate desire and long-term desires, we call longing.\\" Egonomics is the pursuit of awareness of that longing.

Batey had held the seat since the 1922 general election.  Candidates  The Labour party selected as its candidate the 54-year-old James Dixon Murray. The parties in the war-time Coalition Government had agreed not to contest vacancies in seats held by other coalition parties, but other by- elections had been contested by independent candidates or those from minor parties. (The most recent was Maldon in June 1940, where an independent Labour candidate won what had previously been a safe seat for the Conservatives).

One way this is related to behavioral economics is by means of the concept of hyperbolic discounting, in which immediate consequences of a decision are disproportionately weighed compared to the future consequences. A potential cause is lack of access to full information regarding the associated costs and benefits prior to consumption. This contrasts with traditional economic theory, which makes the assumption that individuals are rational decision makers who take all personal costs into account when paying for goods and services. One example of a positive internality is the long run effect of exercising, if these are not taken into account when deciding whether to exercise. Future benefits that an individual may not take into consideration include a diminished risk of heart disease and higher bone density. A common example of a potential negative internality is the effect of smoking cigarettes on those who smoke. For the effect of secondhand smoke, see externality. Statistically, 80% of smokers want to quit, and 54% of people who are serious about quitting fail in a week or less. This implies that they do not act in their long-term best interest due to short-term discomfort, also known as a self-control problem. If the demand for cigarettes has a high price elasticity of demand, which evidence seems to suggest, the government can combat the negative internality by raising taxes. It is important to note that elasticity might change based on location and knowledge about the harmful health effects of smoking. In traditional economic theory, a tax diminishes the welfare of the poor because the tax burden shifts to low-income communities, as fewer can afford the good (cigarettes), and horizontal equity (economics) is distorted. However, behavioral economic theory suggests that the tax is not regressive if low-income communities have higher (healthcare) costs and more price sensitivity than individuals with higher incomes. Taxes imposed to combat internalities are most effective when they target a specific good. A tax on junk food could apply to a large variety of goods that are widely consumed, and the cost of the tax might be perceived as more detrimental than beneficial for society. A major issue with creating effective legislature against negative internalities is that the tax imposed should only reflect the cost that individuals do not factor into their consumption decisions. The difficulty in measuring individual knowledge is an obstacle to developing new policies. Another point of concern is that the group benefitting from the tax, such as smokers who want to quit, must be sizable enough to offset any backlash from tobacco companies and lobbyists. Taxing Internalities 1 Taxing Internalities 2 In the following graphs, D' and S' are the demand and supply curves if producers and consumers take all external costs (EC) into consideration. The tax attempting to prevent the internality should be set equal to the difference between D and D' at the optimal quantity, which is the unmeasured internal cost (IC).

The first workshop was organized by Carlisle Adams, Henk Meijer, Stafford Tavares and Paul van Oorschot. Through 1999, SAC was hosted at either Queen's University or Carleton University, but starting in 2000, locations have ranged across Canada. SAC has featured research presentations on many cryptographic topics, with a traditional focus on the design and analysis of block ciphers. SAC is regarded as a high-quality venue for presenting cryptographic results, and is the only cryptography conference held annually in Canada. Since 2003, SAC has included an invited lecture called the Stafford Tavares Lecture, in honor of one of its original organizers and strongest supporters. Each year, SAC features four topics: # Design and analysis of symmetric key primitives and cryptosystems including block and stream ciphers, hash functions, MAC algorithms, and authenticated encryption schemes. # Efficient implementations of symmetric and public key algorithms. # Mathematical and algorithmic aspects of applied cryptology. # A special topic selected by the current co-chairs that may vary from year to year.

Wellman, and starring Barbara Stanwyck, Ben Lyon, Joan Blondell and Clark Gable. The picture was based on the 1930 novel of the same name written by Grace Perkins, later Mrs. Fulton Oursler (under the pen name Dora Macy). The film was considered risqu√© at the time of its release, particularly the scenes where Stanwyck and Blondell are seen in their lingerie. Plot Lora Hart (Barbara Stanwyck) applies for a job as a trainee nurse in a hospital, but is rejected by the Superintendent of Nurses, Miss Dillon (Vera Lewis), for not having graduated from high school. A chance encounter with the hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Arthur Bell (Charles Winninger), in an uncooperative revolving door, gets that requirement waived. Lora's roommate and fellow nurse, Miss Maloney (Joan Blondell), becomes her best friend. Lora is assigned to night duty in the emergency room. One night, Lora treats bootlegger Mortie (Ben Lyon), for a gunshot wound and earns his gratitude by letting herself be persuaded not to report it to the police as required by law. He also admires the pretty young nurse. After she passes her training, Lora is hired for private duty, looking after two sick children, Desney and Nanny Ritchie. She moves into the Ritchie mansion, where there is always a party going on. The children's socialite mother, Mrs Ritchie (Charlotte Merriam), lives in an alcoholic stupor, infatuated with the brutish chauffeur Nick (Clark Gable). When a drunken guest tries to molest Lora, Nick knocks him out. When Lora refuses his demand that she pump out the stomach of a very drunk Mrs. Ritchie, he knocks her out and takes her to her room. The Ritchie family physician is \\"society doctor\\", and apparent drug addict, Dr. Milton Ranger (Ralf Harolde). Lora becomes alarmed by Dr. Ranger's treatment of the children, because she sees that they are being slowly starved to death, but she is unable to get anybody to take her seriously. She quits and takes her suspicions to Dr. Bell. He is initially reluctant to interfere with another doctor's patients, but eventually advises her to return to her job so she can gather evidence. She persuades Dr. Ranger to take her back. Nanny Ritchie becomes so weak, Lora fears for her life and tries unsuccessfully to get Mrs. Ritchie to show any concern. By chance, Mortie is delivering liquor to the perpetual party at the mansion. Desperate, Lora sends Mortie for milk for a milk bath for Nanny, a folk remedy recommended by the frightened housekeeper, Mrs. Maxwell (Blanche Friderici). Mrs. Maxwell gets drunk and confides her suspicions to Lora. The girls have a trust fund from their late father. Nick ran over and killed their sister with his car, and with Dr. Ranger's connivance, is deliberately starving the little girls to death. The trust fund will pass to the drunken and infatuated Mrs. Ritchie, and murderously vicious Nick will marry her for the money. After being threatened by Mortie, Dr. Bell shows up and examines Nanny. However, when he tries to take Nanny to the hospital, Nick knocks him out. Mortie stops Nick from interfering any further, and Nanny's life is saved by an emergency blood transfusion provided by Lora. The next day, Mortie gives Lora a lift in his car. To allay her worries, he informs her that he told some of his friends that he didn't like Nick. Elsewhere, an ambulance brings a corpse dressed in a chauffeur's uniform to the hospital's morgue.

Reception In July 1931, Time magazine highly praised the film and mentioned that it was well photographed, directed and acted and that the quality of the filmed story surpassed that in the original novel.\\"Cinema: The New Pictures: Jul. 27, 1931\\" Time The New York Times called it exciting \\"at times.\\" According to Variety, \\"Night Nurse is a conglomeration of exaggerations, often bordering on serial dramatics...What legitimate performances crop up in the footage seem to belong to Joan Blondell and Charlie Winninger as the hospital head. Stanwyck plays her dancehall type of a girl on one note throughout and is shy of shading to lend her performance some color.\\" In a 21st-century review, Eric Allen Hatch, writing for the Baltimore City Paper, said \\"watching [Stanwyck, Blondell, and Gable] in very early roles holds much of the appeal here, although the plot still works; a modern viewing of the film yields half high-camp value and half successful drama. Wellman would later strike gold with such films as Beau Geste (1939), but his salacious Night Nurse and hyperviolent Public Enemy were often cited in the creation of Hollywood's self-censoring Production Code. As a result of that code, this film boasts a much higher undressing-nurse-to-running-time ratio.\\" Preservation status * A print is held by the Library of Congress, in the collection since the 1970s.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress, (<-book title) p.127 c.1978 by The American Film Institute The film has been readily available on videotape and DVD.

States with this tax collected the amount allowable as a tax credit to the federal estate tax if paid in state estate taxes. In practice, this additional estate tax was levied directly at the state level but generated a tax credit against the federal tax up to a specified amount. Under a sponge tax regime, the estate will pay no more in total federal and state estate taxes than it would have paid if there were no state estate tax. This meant that estate planning that produced the best federal estate tax result would automatically produce the best state estate tax result. The state estate tax gets its name because the state is \\"sponging\\" off the federal tax. The 2001 Federal Tax Act phased out the federal credit, completely eliminating it in 2005. (The federal estate tax law did replace the credit with a much lower deduction for state estate taxes paid.) The effect of the elimination of the federal credit has generally been the creation of state-level estate taxes to replace the lost revenue.

History Located along the medieval trade routes from Silesia to Hungary, by the Amber Road and the Eastern Neisse river, the town of Lewin first developed in the Middle Ages as a market town, located within the Piast-ruled Kingdom of Poland and as a result of the fragmentation of Poland it became part of the duchies of Opole, Brzeg and Legnica. It is first mentioned in a contract from 1257, when a monastery run by the Knights Hospitaller in ≈Åosi√≥w purchased a mill near the town. Its name is of Old Polish origin and refers to hunting.Heinrich Adamy, Die Schlesischen Ortsnamen ihre entstechung und bedeutung, 1888, s. 11 (in German) As early as the mid-13th century the city had received Magdeburg town rights, which granted the town a certain amount of autonomy. The town was built around a rectangular marketplace, and surrounded by a rampart with a palisade with a ditch below it that could, if necessary, through the opening of a lock could be filled with water from the Eastern Neisse. In addition, there were four city gates. In 1333 the town was granted new rights and privileges, such as the brewing of beer and the holding of Wednesday markets, by Duke Boles≈Çaw III the Generous. Lewin switched between the duchies of Legnica and Brzeg and remained under the rule of the Piast dynasty until 1675, although it fell under the suzerainty of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown in 1329, Hungary in 1469, and again Bohemia in 1490, then ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty until 1526 and the House of Habsburg afterwards. Historical architecture on the Market Square The 16th century brought an economic boom to the city. Since 1592 yearly fairs were organized with the permission of the duke of Brzeg. After the Reformation the town became mainly Protestant, and the Catholic parish was disbanded. During the Thirty Years' War the town was looted, burned, and struck by the Plague. After the dissolution of the Duchy of Legnica in 1675, it was incorporated into the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1742, under the Germanized name L√∂wen, it became part of Prussia, by then a town of almost 700 people. Several town fires burned the city, the most devastating in 1829, which destroyed the wooden buildings completely and ushered in a fundamental reconstruction of the city. The city was rebuilt with stone buildings, such as the neoclassical Town Hall built in 1837 at the Market Square. In 1846 L√∂wen was attached to the Upper Silesian Railway, which brought a revival of industry to the city. In 1866 a metal factory was founded, which produced at first agricultural equipment, then screws, and, much later, finally tape recorders. Other industries included a brick factory, a roof and floor tile factory and a mill. In 1866 the Catholic parish was reestablished, though the St. Mary's Church was not built until the early 20th century. In 1901 the village of Fr√∂beln, which had a sugar factory since 1882 and population of 554 inhabitants in 1885. Administratively, L√∂wen was located in Landkreis Brieg, and the seat of its own local court. The old, dilapidated bridge over the Neisse was replaced in 1913 by a new steel bridge. Pond in Lewin Brzeski During World War II the Germans brought hundreds of forced labourers to the town, mostly Poles, but also Russians, Ukrainians, the French, Jews ans Serbs, both civilians and prisoners of war. In the final stages of World War II, in January 1945, the Germans evacuated most of the population, leaving only the elderly in the town, and recruited many inhabitants into the Volkssturm. On 4 February 1945 the town was overtaken by the Red Army, which plundered it afterwards. After the Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II the town was transferred to Polish control and its historic name Lewin was restored, with the adjective Brzeski added after the nearby city of Brzeg. It was repopulated by Poles, some of thems expell√©es from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, in particular from pre-war southeastern Polish regions Stanis≈Çaw√≥w and Lw√≥w. It was first administered as part of Wroclaw Voivodeship and in 1950 the city was moved to the Opole Voivodeship, where it has remained despite the administrative reforms of 1999. In the years 1950‚Äì1953 a secret anti-communist organization Podziemny Orze≈Ç Wolno≈õci (\\"Underground Eagle of Freedom\\") operated in the town. Its co-founder, Mieczys≈Çaw J√≥zefczyk, was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, one of the highest Polish decorations, in 2017. A monument of Pope John Paul II was unveiled in Lewin Brzeski in 2014. Coat of arms The coat of arms of Lewin was adopted on 18 June 1998 and was based on a seal from the year 1333.

Iron baron Coleman was born in County Donegal, and arrived in Philadelphia from Ireland in 1764. After serving as a clerk and bookkeeper he went on to acquire a lease on Salford Forge near Norristown in 1773 and immediately made a sizeable profit by manufacturing cannonballs and shot at Salford and Elizabeth Furnaces. He then used his profits to purchase a two- thirds share of Elizabeth Furnace, shares of Cornwall and the Upper and Lower Hopewell Forges (not the similarly named Hopewell Furnace), and ownership of Speedwell Forge. Soon Coleman was able to construct Colebrook Furnace, purchase the rest of Elizabeth Furnace and acquired 80% ownership of Cornwall Furnace and the ore mines nearby. His business acquisitions and the profits turned from them enabled him to become the first millionaire in the history of Pennsylvania. Politics Coleman spent more than three decades as a politician in Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Federalist Party. His career in government began when he attended the Pennsylvania State Constitutional Convention in 1776. Additionally, he served in the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1783, attended the Pennsylvania convention to ratify the United States Constitution in 1787, was chosen as a Presidential elector in both 1792 and 1796, and held the position of Associate Judge from 1791 to 1811. In 1795, Coleman achieved his lone military accomplishment when, as Captain of the Lancaster Troop of Light Horse, he led a company of thirty-five cavalrymen to Western Pennsylvania to assist in the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Family Anne Old Coleman Coleman married Anne Old, the daughter of his former employer at Quittapahilla and Speedwell Forges, James Old. Robert and Anne had ten children. His family ultimately settled in Lancaster in 1808. Two of his daughters, Anne Caroline and Sarah, would meet tragic ends while his four sons (William, Edward, Thomas Bird and James) would inherit his estate. Anne Caroline began dating future United States President James Buchanan in 1818. Buchanan was at the time a lawyer in Lancaster County. They soon became engaged, much to Robert Coleman's displeasure. Coleman was apparently unhappy with Buchanan's reputation and checkered history at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Rumors abounded that Buchanan was marrying Anne Caroline for her money, as well as seeing other women. After one incident of him visiting a friend's wife (this may have been an innocent visit), Ann broke off their engagement and died soon afterward, probably from an overdose of laudanum. Some historians theorize this may have been a suicide. James Buchanan was so devastated by the broken engagement and suicide that he vowed never to marry and eventually became the only bachelor President in the history of the United States. Coleman's other daughter Sarah also committed suicide. She loved William Augustus Muhlenberg who was co-rector of St. James Episcopal Church in Lancaster. Robert Coleman again disapproved of his daughter's relationship. Coleman and Muhlenberg had a bitter dispute about evening worship services. Upon Coleman's death in 1825, Sarah had hoped to be able to finally marry the rector. Coleman's will granted his sons Edward and James the right to approve of Sarah's spouse. Edward also dislike Muhlenberg and would not approve the marriage. Sarah then fled to Philadelphia and committed suicide. Coleman died in Lancaster at age 76. He was one of the wealthiest and most respected men in Pennsylvania. His legacy was retained through the surviving companies of the Cornwall Iron Furnace company until the industry was replaced by steel manufacturing late in the 19th Century.

The mountain lies a few kilometres west of the Matterhorn. The Aosta hut (2,781 m) is used for the normal route. Naming The mountain takes its name from the Val d'H√©rens, a valley located further to the north. The original name was probably the Dent Blanche, which is now that of the nearby Dent Blanche which overlooks the Val d'H√©rens. On older maps, in the area where both summits lie, only the name Weisszahnhorn (from German: White Tooth Peak) was given, the French name (Dent Blanche) appearing only in 1820. Because cartographers usually made their observations far away from the remoter areas and also because the Dent d'H√©rens is sometime hidden behind the Dent Blanche, thus being less visible, the latter received the name. The inhabitants of the lower Val d'H√©rens called the Dent d'H√©rens, the Dent Blanche, but those of the upper Val d'H√©rens called it the Dent de Rong or the Dent d'Erins, contributing to the general confusion.

The northern side of the mountain is part of the drainage basin of the Rhone, while the south side is part of the drainage basin of the Po River. The Dent d'H√©rens lies 4 km west of the Matterhorn and north of the village of Cervinia on the Italian (south) side. On the Swiss (north) side, the mountain rises above the Zmutt Glacier in the remote valley of Zmutt, 12 km away from the town of Zermatt. Despite its name suggests, the Dent d'H√©rens does not overlook the Val d'H√©rens, as the Dent Blanche lying a few kilometers to the north do. Climbing history The first ascent of the mountain was by Florence Crauford Grove, William Edward Hall, Reginald Somerled Macdonald, Montagu Woodmass, Melchior Anderegg, Jean-Pierre Cachat and Peter Perren on 12 August 1863. The mountain had been attempted a few days before by Edward Whymper, Jean Antoine Carrel and Luc Meynet but Whymper insisted that they retreat from their planned route up the west ridge because of loose rock. Whymper was annoyed that he had not chosen the line taken up the Grandes Murailles glacier and the south-west flank by Melchior Anderegg on the first ascent and later wrote: :This was the only mountain in the Alps that I have essayed to ascend, that has not, sooner or later, fallen to me. Our failure was mortifying . . .Quoted in Dumler, Helmut and Willi P. Burkhardt, The High Mountains of the Alps, London: Diadem, 1994, p. 157 The first winter ascent was by M. Piacenza, J. J. Carrell and G. B. Pellisier on 16 January 1910. View from the Klein Matterhorn (east side) The 1,300-metre north face was first explored by George Finch, T. G. B. Forster and R. Peto on August 2, 1923 via the North Face Diagonal or 'Finch Route'. A traversing rather than a more directly ascending line, it avoided the main difficulties of the face; these were tackled two years later by the direct line of the 'Welzenbach Route' (Willo Welzenbach and Eugen Allwein) on 10 August 1925, which may be considered the first ascent of the face. On 5 August 1959 Wilfrid Noyce, together with C. J. Mortlock and Jack Sadler, made the first British ascent of the Welzenbach route. This route was the scene of a large rescue operation on its first winter ascent on 14-17 March 1964.According to Collomb, 'a notable incident for the Zermatt rescue services.' Collomb, Robin G., Pennine Alps Central, London: Alpine Club, 1975, p. 277 Having climbed the face and bivouacked on the summit, the combined team of German (Gerhard Dewe√ü and Leo Herncarek), Polish (Jerzy Hajdukiewicz and Krzysztof Berbeka) and Swiss (Eckhart Grassmann, Pierre Monkewitz and Dieter Naef) climbers suffered two falls, one of 200 metres, on the descent down the south-west face. The injured climbers were stuck on the mountain for four days before rescue, with Berbeka later dying in hospital and Dewe√ü and Naef requiring amputations.

Anna students regularly score above state and national standards on standardized tests, and ACT scores are regularly above the national average. Anna Schools are expanding in the use of technology in its schools with students regularly using many different technologies for school work. The elementary school was designed with such technology in mind and has the wiring capability built-in to expand on that technology as new developments occur. Both district buildings are networked, have fiber-optic cables connecting the two buildings, and have access to distance learning. A wide range of extracurricular activities is available to students. Whether a student's interests are athletics, dramatics, music, or clubs; there are many excellent extracurricular choices for them.

Its parent company, First Niagara Financial Group, Inc. was the 44th-largest bank in the United States with assets of over $37.1 billion as of June 30, 2013. History It was founded in 1870 as Farmers and Mechanics' Savings Bank and was then re-branded as Lockport Savings Bank in 1967. In 2000 the bank was rebranded as First Niagara. The bank was based in its former home county, Niagara until the 1990s when it spread to nearby Buffalo, New York and its surrounding Erie County. Part of this growth could be attributed to the collapse of the Buffalo-centric banks Goldome and Empire of America. Most of this growth was from the recruitment of new customers, as opposed to the purchase of other firms' assets. Although, in 1998 the bank did purchase the regional insurance brokerage firm Warren-Hoffman & Associates Inc. as a means of entering the insurance business. First Niagara, in 2000, acquired Albion Bancorp of Albion, NY to bring the total number of bank branches to 22. In 2002, First Niagara acquired Cayuga Bank of Auburn, New York and Cortland Savings Bank in Cortland, New York. In 2003, First Niagara acquired the Bank of Finger Lakes in Geneva, New York. In 2004, First Niagara acquired Troy Savings Bank in Albany, New York.http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2003/08/18/story1.html In 2005, First Niagara acquired Hudson River Bank and Trust in Hudson, New York. LCo Building, Buffalo. In September 2007, it was announced that First Niagara was to purchase Great Lakes Bancorp, parent company of Greater Buffalo Savings Bank. The price to purchase the 16 branch bank was $153 million. With the nearly $900 million of assets of the Great Lakes Bancorp, First Niagara became the fourth largest bank in the Buffalo-Niagara region . In April 2009, First Niagara acquired 57 of the 61 of National City branches in Erie and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They were rebranded on Labor Day weekend in 2009. In conjunction with the expansion into Pittsburgh, First Niagara bought the naming rights for a concert venue, First Niagara Pavilion. In April 2010, First Niagara Financial Group acquired Pennsylvania-based Harleysville National. This created a bank with $19.7 billion in assets, 254 branches and approximately $13.7 billion in deposits. In August 2010, First Niagara announced its acquisition of NewAlliance Bank of Connecticut.http://www.marketwatch.com/story/first-niagara-to-buy-newalliance- in-15-bln-deal-2010-08-19?reflink=MW_news_stmp The stock holders approved the merger in December 2010 and the transaction closed on April 15, 2011. This provided First Niagara with over 340 branches and 500 ATMs. On August 25, 2011, First Niagara bought the naming rights for HSBC Arena in Buffalo, renaming it the First Niagara Center. On October 30, 2015, First Niagara Bank agreed to be acquired by KeyCorp.https://www.key.com/about/articles/keybank- first-niagara-agreement-103015.jsp?ppc=Q4_prFN_tw 18 branches in Erie and Niagara Counties were sold to Northwest Savings Bank for antitrust reasons. 21st century growth=National City On April 7, 2009, First Niagara agreed to buy 57 National City branches in Western Pennsylvania from PNC Financial Serviceshttp://kdka.com/business/PNC.First.Niagara.2.978660.html and officially took over those branches on September 8 after the signs were changed over from National City during Labor Day Weekend. Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania along U.S. Route 19 just off the Pennsylvania Turnpike. This is a former National City branch. PNC, which had acquired National City in late 2008 with money from the $700 billion bailout plan after National City suffered losses in the subprime mortgage crisis, was required by the United States Department of Justice to sell 50 National City branches in the Pittsburgh area and 11 more branches in and around Erie to competitors,http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/branches-divested.pdf since the two banks had significant overlap in Western Pennsylvania‚ÄîPNC and National City were number 1 and 2 in market share, respectively‚Äîand had potential antitrust issues in the area. (Even after the sale was completed, PNC retained a market-leading 46% share in the Pittsburgh market, with Citizens Financial Group in a distant second at 13%.) A dark horse candidate, the sale to First Niagara was considered a surprise, considering that PNC was also in negotiations with much larger banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank, Huntington Bancshares, and FNB Corporation for the branches. Fifth Third, Huntington, & FNB had existing branches in the market, while JPMorgan Chase's retail banking division & Key were in adjacent territories, and Wells Fargo was in the process of expanding its Eastern U.S. operations by way of its acquisition of Wachovia. Before the deal was announced, First Niagara was thought to be interested only in the Erie-area National City branches. First Niagara branch footprint as of March 2013. First Niagara, which had been eyeing an expansion into Pittsburgh for some time, was immediately ranked third in market share at 8%, ahead of the longer- established Dollar Bank and First Commonwealth Bank at six and five percent, respectively. First Niagara retained all National City employees at the acquired branches in the Pittsburgh and Erie areas, and established a regional office in Downtown Pittsburgh's 11 Stanwix Street tower. First Niagara was outbid for the four branches in Crawford County, Pennsylvania that PNC had to divest. Of those four, one branch in Titusville was sold to Emclaire Financial Group while the other three (one in Conneaut Lake, the other two in Meadville, including the branch inside Wal-Mart) were sold to Marquette Savings Bank. On August 4, 2009, First Niagara agreed to take over the automatic teller machines (ATMs) at 95 Sheetz locations throughout Western Pennsylvania, replacing M&T; Bank, which doesn't have any bank branches in the region. The ATMs, which officially become First Niagara ATMs at the same time First Niagara took over the former National City branches, will be surcharge-free from First Niagara itself, though people using the ATMs may still be charged a foreign ATM fee from their primary financial institution if they charge such fees. The ATM's were later replaced by PNC across Sheetz's footprint. Harleysville National On July 27, 2009, First Niagara agreed to acquire the Philadelphia-area-based Harleysville National Corporation financial services company in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately or $5.50 per share, allowing First Niagara its first access to the Philadelphia market. The deal provided First Niagara with $5.6 billion in assets, including $3.6 billion in loans and $4.1 billion in deposits in 83 bank branches in nine Eastern Pennsylvania counties. The parent company of Harleysville National Bank also operates East Penn Bank, Millennium Wealth Management and Cornerstone Companies. First Niagara maintained all Harleysville National and East Penn branches, and the Pennsylvania company's growing commercial banking and wealth-management business. Harleysville had over 1,100 employees. The deal was completed on April 9, 2010. HSBC deal expands presence in northeastern U.S. On July 31, 2011, First Niagara announced it would purchase from UK-based HSBC Holdings plc nearly half of its HSBC Bank USA branch network, including 195 branches for a price of US$1 billion. Of these, six branches in New York City suburbs, and six in Connecticut; most of these branches had been part of Buffalo-based Marine Midland Bank before being re- branded to HSBC Bank USA in the late 1990s. The deal included US$15 billion in deposits, US$2.8 billion in loans, and US$4.3 billion in assets under management. The deal also nearly doubled First Niagara's branch network to about 450 branches, US$38 billion in assets, and US$30 billion in deposits. Pending regulatory approval, the deal will close in early 2012. Investors had complained that HSBC had spread itself too thinly, with roughly 95 million customers and 300,000 employees in 87 markets. As a result of the acquisition, the United States Department of Justice required First Niagara to divest itself of 26 branches. First Niagara ended up spinning off 64 branches; 37 to KeyBank, 19 to Community Bank, and 8 to Five Star Bank. On October 30, 2015, First Niagara Bank agreed to be acquired by KeyCorp.

No explanation for Hills' absence from the masthead during Gordon's tenure is mentioned in those issues; but an editorial by Gordon in the Sept. 1925 issue (page 132), which refers to Hills as the magazine's conductor for nearly 40 years, suggests he was still involved in its operation, even if his name wasn't on the masthead. Hills' obituary in the December 1930 edition (page 315) also seems to indicate he was involved with the magazine continuously from 1887 to 1926. William Dorsey Kennedy served as editor from March 1926 ‚Äì December 1928. From 1929 to 1933, an editorial board was listed, which prominently featured Virginia C. Lincoln and Bertha W. Smith. Other board members changed, but Lincoln and Smith, who were listed as publisher and managing editor, respectively, by the October 1929 issue, remained in those positions until February 1934. From March 1934 ‚Äì January 1936, Sargent Collier and Samuel G. Houghton served as publishers and editors. The longest editorial era began in February 1936, when A.S. Burack took over the editor's chair. He would remain editor until his death in August 1978. Burack's widow, Sylvia, then took over as editor (and later as publisher as well). In 2000, she sold the magazine to Kalmbach Publishing. From November 2000 to October 2007, The Writer was edited by Elfrieda Abbe, who also became publisher with the September 2006 issue. As of the November 2007 issue, she turned the editorial reins over to Jeff Reich (formerly the magazine's managing editor), to focus exclusively on her duties as publisher. She was preceded as publisher by Russell G. Larson and Judith Hill. The Writer's current editorial board consists of James Applewhite, Andre Becker, T. Alan Broughton, Eve Bunting, Mary Higgins Clark, Roy Peter Clark, Barnaby Conrad, Lewis Burke Frumkes, James Cross Giblin, Gail Godwin, Eileen Goudge, Rachel Hadas, Shelby Hearon, John Jakes, John Koethe, Lois Lowry, Peter Meinke, Robert B. Parker, Katherine Patterson, Elizabeth Peters, Arthur Plotnik, and William G. Tapply. The late Phyllis A. Whitney had been a long- time editorial board member until her death in 2008. Over the years, the magazine has gone through a number of physical changes. The first issue had only 18 pages; and for years The Writer had no illustrations. Currently, The Writer has more than 60 pages per issue, and includes color photographs on both the cover and interior. The magazine's slogan has changed as well, since its inception. From at least 1896 to September 1925, the cover read, \\"A monthly magazine for literary workers.\\" This changed to \\"An author's monthly forum\\" in October 1925. The new slogan ran until at least October 1929. From at least October 1930 ‚Äì April 1932, the slogan changed subtly to \\"the author's forum.\\" In March 1934, the slogan changed to \\"The pioneer magazine for literary workers\\", and would remain until October of that year. In November 1934, the slogan changed to \\"The oldest magazine for literary workers. Founded in Boston, 1887\\", and remained until 2000. At that point, the slogan changed to \\"The essential resource for writers since 1887.\\" The slogan changed in December 2008 to \\"Advice and inspiration for today's writer,\\" and again in January 2012 to \\"Imagine ‚Ä¢ Write ‚Ä¢ Publish.\\" In May 1962, during its 75th anniversary, The Writer was honored with a congratulatory letter from President John F. Kennedy. As of 2011, The Writer has won the Folio magazine Editorial Excellence Award nine times.

He served three tours in Vietnam during the First Indochina War. Piroth commanded the artillery during the Battle of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß. He was bold and optimistic before hostilities erupted, exulting \\"I've got more guns than I need.\\" After failures by his artillery batteries to provide adequate support, he committed suicide in his bunker.  Biography = Military career  Piroth served as an artillery officer in the Italian Campaign during World War II. His last regimental command was with the 41st Colonial Artillery Regiment. Piroth served a total of three tours in Indochina, arriving at first with General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque as a major in October 1945. He and his artillerymen were pressed into service as infantry, due to the need for soldiers on the front line and the lack of targets for artillery. Piroth proved a popular and respected commanding officer when serving north of Saigon in an area known as Thu Dau Mot. On 17 December 1946, Piroth was critically wounded during an ambush though he remained in command until he was eventually evacuated to Saigon, where his arm was amputated without anaesthesia. Piroth was sent to recover in France. He returned to Indochina, but a year later, in 1950, newly arrived General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny dismissed him from the general staff.  ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß  In late 1953, Piroth was given command of the artillery force at ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß by its commander Colonel Christian de Castries. The French artillery at ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß comprised only 30 medium and heavy guns, although large stocks of shells were airlifted into the zone before the siege began. Concern was expressed by de Castries and others that the artillery firepower available might prove inadequate in the event of Vi·ªát Minh attack, but the experienced Piroth responded that the Vi·ªát Minh would only be able to move a small number of light artillery pieces through the steep jungle-covered hills that surrounded the valley of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß and that his guns, if well situated, would be capable of dominating the battlefield, adding that \\"no Viet cannon will fire more than three rounds before it is located and destroyed.\\" He reassured his battery officers: \\"Don't worry, boys, they will have to reveal their location when they fire, and five minutes later, no more Viet artillery.\\" During the first four months of the French occupation of the valley, Piroth's optimism appeared justified. However, the Vi·ªát Minh made use of this quiet interlude to concentrate large quantities of artillery on the high ground dominating the French garrison by transporting the weapons along jungle pathways. Piroth's deployment of the outnumbered defending artillery proved inadequate to provide mutually supporting fire for the widely dispersed French strong points. The opening phases of the battle began with three days of heavy bombardment by the Vi·ªát Minh forces led by General V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p. The outmatched defending artillery was unable to adequately assist the besieged French forces on two outlying hills; Gabrielle and Beatrice. Both these fortresses fell quickly to the Vi·ªát Minh. Piroth fell into heavy depression due to the failure of his guns to support the defenders and to nullify the Vi·ªát Minh artillery, as he had promised before the battle began,  Death  On 15 March, having circled the camp to apologise to various fellow officers, Piroth returned to his bunker and removed the pin from a grenade clutched to his chest, blowing himself up. He was buried secretly in his bunker, and his death was covered up for several days until newspapers dropped on the camp notified the men, the news of the death having been leaked to the paper from an unknown source. His replacement, Lieutenant Colonel Guy Vaillant, arrived on 20 March via air ambulance, one of the few to successfully land at ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß during the conflict.

Plot  Abhay Sachdeva and Ritika Khanna are young, modern Indian professionals. They briefly meet at a wedding, and individually make their dislike for arranged marriages known, since they do not understand the concept of marrying a stranger. Unbeknownst to them, their parents meet at the same wedding and compare their horoscopes, which begins the process of arranging a match. Even though they each have strong objections, the couple eventually give in to their parents' wishes and get married. The newlyweds then embark on a honeymoon trip to Ooty. The trip is part of a romantic getaway package where they will be sharing a lodge with other couples. The first people they meet are Mr and Mrs Chaturvedi, an elderly couple celebrating their anniversary. They constantly bicker and argue, but actually love each other deeply. Abhay and Ritika then meet Shoaib and Anaiya, another newlywed couple. Anaiya is Shoaib's sister's best friend and has always had feelings for him, but Shoaib is unable to think of Anaiya as anything but a childhood friend. Strolling in the forest, the pair meet Rishab and Anu, a couple who are head over heels in love with each other and have come to Ooty on their yearly holiday. They have the perfect romance and the other couples envy them and their amazing relationship. Later, Ritika tries to prolong dinner to avoid spending time alone with Abhay. That night she can't bring herself to consummate the marriage, and after Abhay falls asleep she decides to sleep on the sofa. The next day, the group prepares to go on an outing organised by the lodge management. There they meet A.K. and Sarah, who have arrived late due to delayed trains. A.K. is an explorer who has been out of the country for a long time, and Sarah is his long-term, half- Indian girlfriend. A.K. has proposed many times but Sarah does not see the need for marriage. The couples spend the day exploring the lake and surrounding town. Later, at a celebratory dinner organised for Mr and Mrs Chaturvedi's fortieth anniversary, the group gets better acquainted by sharing the stories of how each couple met. That night Abhay separates the beds in their room so Ritika does not feel uncomfortable any longer. He explains to her that they need to work on their relationship for it to grow; she is still reluctant but her attitude begins to soften. The next day the pair spend time alone, visiting tourist attractions and getting to know each other. The romantic, happy mood is broken that night when Abhay tries to be intimate with Ritika and she lashes out at him, causing an argument. Their relationship is strained but she puts on a show for the other couples, who all believe that they are adjusting to their arranged marriage well. A few days later, a frustrated Abhay expresses his conflicted feelings towards love and marriage, and Mr Chaturvedi gives the men some advice. Meanwhile, the women give Sarah a traditional Indian makeover as a surprise for A.K. He proposes and she accepts, and the other couples plan them a celebration. At the party Shoaib is finally able to see Anaiya as his wife, and they decide to have dinner alone together. Sarah notices the tension between Abhay and Ritika and advises Ritika to work things out before the issue escalates. The celebrations are cut short when an employee informs Rishab that his wife has called to speak to him, and the group realizes that Anu and Rishab are having an affair. An emotional Anu decides to leave Rishab and the lodge that night. The next day, the group departs from the lodge as the trip comes to an end. The bus has an accident and hangs off the edge of a cliff. Abhay makes a plan to get all the passengers off the bus, but a scared Mr and Mrs Chaturvedi refuse to leave. Ritika gets on board again to convince them to get off, and the frightening situation brings her closer to Abhay. As everyone else waits for alternative transport, Abhay and Ritika decide to start afresh, and walk towards the direction of the lodge to begin their honeymoon once again.

Its original Latin name is uncertain. Its remains are incorporated into Cardiff Castle in the modern capital city of Wales. Name Cardiff Castle. The stones below the bed bricks are the original Roman fort The fort's name is uncertain. It could have been Tamium as appears in the Ravenna Cosmography, although this may have been a river name and thus refers to the River Taff. Alternatively it may be Bovium (corrected from Bomio) of the Antonine Itinerary. Early forts Prior to the building of the extant fort, there were at least two previous Roman forts on the site. The first was probably a vexillation camp built during attempted conquest of the Silures tribe around AD 55. About twenty years later, after a period of abandonment, a new smaller Roman auxiliary fort was constructed and was possibly occupied, along with a civilian vicus, until the reign of the Emperor Hadrian. From the late 2nd to the mid-3rd century, civilian timber buildings associated with iron working occupied the site. Carausian shore fort Portchester (Portus Adurni) is the best preserved Roman fort north of the Alps. The D-shaped towers are typical of 3rd-century of Roman forts. Around 290, a 9-acre (3.57 hectare) shore fort was built on the site, not unlike the almost complete example at Portchester in Hampshire. Its walls were ten feet thick and it was positioned to control access to the upper reaches of the River Severn. There may have been associated watch towers on the now eroded cliffs to the west. This is believed to have been the Emperor Carausius' response to increased Irish raids. Its military/naval force eventually moved elsewhere about 370. Post-Roman legends The ruinous fort appears as the residence of 'King Ynwyl' in the story of Geraint and Enid, a medieval romance associated with the Mabinogion. Geraint was possibly a 5th- century King of Dumnonia.

He is the most important writer of the Assyrian Church of the East, in which he is known as the 'Harp of the Spirit'. Although many of his works are likely lost, around eighty of his m√™mr√™ (), or verse homilies are extant.  Life Narsai was born at ‚ÄòAin Dulba () in the district of Ma‚Äòalta () in the Sassanid Empire (today in Dahuk Governorate, Iraq). Being orphaned at an early age, he was raised by his uncle, who was head of the monastery of Kfar Mari () near Beth Zabdai (). Narsai spent ten years as a student at the School of Edessa, and later returned there to teach (c. 437), eventually becoming head of the school. Perhaps in 471, Narsai left Edessa after disagreeing with the city's bishop Cyrus (471‚Äì498). With the help of his friend Barsauma, who was bishop of Nisibis (although Narsai and Barsauma's wife do not seem to have seen eye-to-eye), Narsai re-established the School of Nisibis. When his former school was ordered closed by Zeno in 489, it seems that many of his faithful staff and students came to join Narsai in Nisibis. Evidence from the first Statutes of the School of Nisibis, drafted in 496, shows that Narsai was still alive, and he must have been a venerable old teacher in his nineties. Narsai died sometime early in the sixth century and was buried in Nisibis in a church that was later named after him. Joseph Huzaya was one of his pupils. All of Narsai's extant works belong to the distinctive Syriac literary genre of the m√™mr√¢, or homily in verse. He employs two different metres ‚Äî one with couplets of seven syllables per line, the other with twelve. The m√™mr√™ were designed to be recited in church or religious school, and each one being an exposition of a particular religious theme. The later Syriac writer Abdisho bar Berika of Nisibis suggests that Narsai wrote 360 m√™mr√™ in twelve volumes along with prose commentaries on large sections of the Old Testament and a book entitled On the Corruption of Morals. However, only eighty m√™mr√™ remain, and none of his prose works.

Science fiction was one of the major genres published by Panther Books and titles included Ray Bradbury's The Golden Apples of the Sun and Asimov's Foundation Trilogy. In 1954 Gordon Landsborough was employed as editor and started improving the quality of the imprint. Instead of publishing original genre novels in paperback and hardback, Panther Books became a reprint publisher, doing paperback reprints of best-selling hardcover novels from other publishers. The quality of the cover art was improved and the list expanded to include non- fiction titles and fiction titles by internationally known, best-selling writers. By at least April 1966, books published under the Panther name indicate that the business was based at 108 Brompton Road, London, S.W.5. However, records of the tumultuous process of mergers and acquisitions in the publishing industry show that by 1968, Granada Group Ltd had acquired a number of publishers who became subsidiary companies of Granada Publishing Ltd. These included, among others, Panther Books Ltd, and thus Panther Science Fiction became a Granada imprint. In 1983, Granada sold the publishing side of its business to the Scottish publishers William Collins, Sons & Co, based in Glasgow. In 1989, William Collins Sons & Co merged with the American publishers Harper & Row, located in New York, to form HarperCollins, the British side of the company being managed through Harper Collins Publishers Ltd.

He recorded many albums for Cadence Records during the 1950s and 1960s, experimenting with jazz with a classical influence. He wrote organ symphonies, piano concerti, a cello concerto, three string quartets, a one-act opera, works for organ, piano and violin, a symphonic tone poem based on the 1939 novel Finnegans Wake by James Joyce, and a set of \\"Variations\\" on the 1858 opera Orpheus in the Underworld. Born in Pensacola, Florida, Shirley was a promising young student of classical piano. Although he did not achieve recognition in his early career playing traditional classical music, he found success with his blending of various musical traditions. During the 1960s, Shirley went on a number of concert tours, some in Deep South states. For a time, he hired New York nightclub bouncer Tony \\"Lip\\" Vallelonga as his driver and bodyguard. Their story was dramatized in the 2018 film Green Book, in which he was played by Mahershala Ali. Biography= Early life  Donald Walbridge Shirley was born on January 29, 1927, in Pensacola, Florida, to Jamaican immigrants, Stella Gertrude (1903‚Äì1936), a teacher, and Edwin S. Shirley (1885‚Äì1982), an Episcopal priest. Shirley started to learn piano when he was two years old. He briefly enrolled at Virginia State University and Prairie View College, then studied with Conrad Bernier and Thaddeus Jones at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he received his bachelor's degree in music in 1953. Known as \\"Dr. Shirley,\\" he had two honorary doctorates. His birthplace was sometimes incorrectly given as Kingston, Jamaica, because his label advertised him as being Jamaican-born. According to some sources, Shirley traveled to the Soviet Union to study piano and music theory at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music. According to his nephew, Edwin, his record label falsely claimed that he studied music in Europe to \\"make him acceptable in areas where a Black man from a Black school wouldn‚Äôt have got any recognition at all.\\" Career: 1945‚Äì1953 In 1945, at the age of 18, Shirley performed the Tchaikovsky B-flat minor concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. A year later, Shirley performed one of his compositions with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1949, he received an invitation from the Haitian government to play at the Exposition Internationale du Bi- Centenaire de Port-au-Prince, followed by a request from President Estim√© and Archbishop Joseph-Marie Le Gouaze for a repeat performance the next week. Shirley was married to Jean C. Hill in Cook County, Illinois on December 23, 1952, but they later divorced. Discouraged by the lack of opportunities for classical black musicians, Shirley abandoned the piano as a career for a time. He studied psychology at the University of Chicago and began work in Chicago as a psychologist. There he returned to music. He was given a grant to study the relationship between music and juvenile crime, which had broken out in the postwar era of the early 1950s. Playing in a small club, he experimented with sound to determine how the audience responded. The audience was unaware of his experiments and that students had been planted to gauge their reactions. Career: 1954‚Äì2013 At Arthur Fiedler's invitation, Shirley appeared with the Boston Pops in Chicago in June 1954. In 1955, he performed with the NBC Symphony at the premiere of Ellington's Piano Concerto at Carnegie Hall. He also appeared on TV on Arthur Godfrey and His Friends. During the 1950s and 1960s, Shirley recorded many albums for Cadence Records, experimenting with jazz with a classical influence. In 1961, his single \\"Water Boy\\" reached No. 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on the chart for 14 weeks. He performed in New York City at Basin Street East, where Duke Ellington heard him and they started a friendship. The Negro Motorist Green Book listed businesses that served black travelers in the segregated South During the 1960s, Shirley went on a number of concert tours, some in Southern states, believing that he could change some minds with his performances. For his initial tour, in 1962, he hired New York nightclub bouncer Tony \\"Lip\\" Vallelonga as his driver and bodyguard. Their story is dramatized in the 2018 film Green Book, the name of a travel guide for black motorists in the segregated United States. The film controversially depicts Shirley as estranged from his family and alienated from other African Americans. Shirley's surviving family members disputed this, stating that he was involved in the Civil Rights Movement, attended the 1965 Selma to Montgomery march, and knew other African American artists and leaders. He had three brothers, and according to his family kept in contact with them. Author David Hajdu, who met and befriended Shirley in the 1990s through composer Luther Henderson, wrote: \\"the man I knew was considerably different from the character Ali portrayed with meticulous elegance in Green Book.\\" Shirley was cerebral but disarmingly earthy, mercurial, self- protective, and intolerant of imperfections in all things, particularly music, he was as complex and uncategorizable as his sui generis music.\\" In late 1968, Shirley performed the Tchaikovsky concerto with the Detroit Symphony. He also worked with the Chicago Symphony and the National Symphony Orchestra. He wrote symphonies for the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra. He played as soloist with the orchestra at Milan's La Scala opera house in a program dedicated to George Gershwin's music. Russian-born composer Igor Stravinsky, who was a contemporary of Shirley's, said of him, \\"His virtuosity is worthy of Gods.\\"  Death  Shirley died of heart disease on April 6, 2013, at the age of 86.

Locations most often named in policies include Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, and Nigeria, certain other countries in Latin America, as well as some parts of the Russian Federation and Eastern Europe. Central Asia is also seeing increasing numbers of incidents, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Coverage K&R; insurance policies typically cover the perils of kidnap, extortion, wrongful detention, and hijacking. K&R; policies are indemnity policies ‚Äì they reimburse a loss incurred by the insured. The policies do not pay ransoms on the behalf of the insured. Typically, the insured must first pay the ransom, thus incurring the loss, and then seek reimbursement under the policy. Losses typically reimbursed by K&R; insurance include: * Ransom monies - Money paid or lost due to kidnapping * Transit/delivery - Loss due to destruction, disappearance, confiscation, or wrongful appropriation of ransom monies being delivered to a covered kidnapping or extortion * Accidental death or dismemberment - Death or permanent physical disablement occurring during a kidnapping * Judgements and legal liability - Cost resulting from any claim or suit brought by any insured person against the insured * Additional expenses - Medical care, severe disruption of operations, potential damage to company brand, PR counsel, wage and salary replacement, relocation and job retraining, and other expenses related to a kidnapping incident. The policies also typically pay for the fees and expenses of crisis management consultants. These consultants provide advice to the insured on how to best respond to the incident. Even the most basic training for people traveling to dangerous places is not easily provided or is not obtained by small to mid-sized companies.  Intended audience  The policies may be written to cover high-profile families, non-government organizations (NGOs), C-Suite level executives or similar strategic individuals, or individuals who represent a local or multinational organizations. Some policies include kidnap prevention training.  Underwriting considerations  The major factors insurance underwriters weigh when considering a kidnap and ransom policy include the country of residence for the insured, the type of industry of the insured, revenue of the insured, and the travel patterns of any employees who may be covered by the policy.  Problems  One of the known paradoxes of K&R; policies is that those who have them are often not aware, as it can be provided by an employer hoping to protect the company's assets. It is believed that an employee with knowledge of his K&R; policy might begin to act differently, or even collude in his own kidnap for fraudulent purposes. In 2010, criminal gangs were believed to make $500 million a year from kidnap and ransom payments.

The title is a play on \\"house cleaning\\". It was produced in Technicolor and released to theatres on December 11, 1948, by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer and again on February 17, 1956. It was animated by Ray Patterson, Irven Spence, Kenneth Muse and Ed Barge, who were the usual animators for the Tom and Jerry cartoons in the early 1940s up until the late 1950s. It was directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, and produced by Fred Quimby; no writer has yet been credited (though many suppose it was Hanna and Barbera). The music was scored by Scott Bradley and the backgrounds were created by Robert Gentle. This was Stepin Fetchit's only role in animation, as the uncredited voice of Tom. Plot While chasing Jerry in the garden, Tom runs through a mud puddle and then into the house, tracking mud on the kitchen floor right after Mammy Two Shoes has finished cleaning. As punishment, Mammy makes Tom clean the floor and orders him to keep the house clean, while she leaves to go shopping. Once she is gone, Jerry wants to sabotage Tom, so he begins making a mess around the house by, among other things, emptying the ashtray onto the floor, squirting ink from a fountain pen into a pail, juggling food, bringing an old horse and pushing an ink stamp pad onto Tom's paws while he takes a nap, causing the cat to leave a long trail of paw prints in the living room. Tom throws Jerry down the laundry chute into the basement and quickly cleans the room. As he does so, a coal truck arrives at the house to make a delivery, and Jerry uses a rope to pull the truck's delivery chute up to the living room window, causing the house to flood with coal. When Mammy returns from shopping and discovers this, she blames Tom, who flees. As he runs, Mammy throws lumps of coal at him, one of which knocks him out. Reception Boxoffice reviewed the short on December 12, 1948, saying, \\"This is a repeat performance of a common film cartoon gag but amusing nevertheless.\\" In 2007, this short and Casanova Cat were pulled from the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection - Volume 3 DVD compilation by Warner Home Video due to the racial stereotype of Mammy Two Shoes.

Ecology Swampy areas, swamp forests, sago (Metroxylon) swamps, marshes, natural and man-made ponds, mostly in stagnant water bodies or in still pockets along slow flowing rivers, full sun to moderate shade, from sea level to 1300 m, but mostly less than 500 m altitude. Sometimes massed on or around logs or other floating vegetation, once recorded in a fresh-water mangrove (Sonneratia) growing among the finger-like pneumatophores. In some areas Ceratopteris exhibits a degree of seasonality, reaching maturity and shedding spores during the dry season; plants have lost nearly all sterile fronds by this stage. The species has been reported to functionally be an annual, repopulating from spore the next season, but it is clearly of indefinite lifespan in cultivation.

Cultivation It grows best in soil with a pH reading of 5-9 and in very high amounts of light. It usually grows quickly. Ceratopteris thalictroides can benefit (like all aquatic plants) from the addition of CO2. The plant's reproductive technique is similar to other ferns. Small adventitious plantlets are grown on the mother plant and are then released when ready. It can provide useful shade to shyer fish and small fry. The dense roots are said to take nutrients out of the water helping to prevent the growth of algae.

Gameplay The game is a traditional third-person action game, with cut-to sections where the player uses the Wii Remote to execute certain moves. For instance, the Wii Remote's pointer is used to trace out Zorro's iconic slash marks to defeat enemies whenever certain conditions are fulfilled, or control Zorro's whip, where the player points at a potential snaring target or grappling point and presses the A Button to launch the whip, allowing Zorro to swing over gaps or pull down objects. Controller gestures are used in combat, where the Wii Remote is used for basic sword moves and the Nunchuk is used for dodging enemy attacks. Setting and music This game takes place in the coast and desert landscape of Spanish California in the early 19th century, as the player takes the role of the hero Zorro. The game is officially described to have drawn \\"inspiration from the Mexican, Spanish and Native Southwest American cultures prevalent in California in the early 1800s\\", giving the player a number of plots to play through, such as taking on Calavera and his troops or a power-hungry mob boss, thwarting a plot to steal a great treasure, and facing off against a rebel army. The game's soundtrack, composed by Andrew Edlen of Harmonic Engineering, takes its inspiration from classical Spanish culture, consistent with the game's setting. Companion game About roughly a year after Destiny's release, 505 Games later released Zorro: Quest for Justice for the Nintendo DS. It shares the same box art as Destiny, but features a significantly different plot and a different combat system, in which Zorro can only fight one enemy at a time and fighting is done with buttons, as opposed to motion controls.

It has a variety of common names such as the stalked sea squirt, clubbed tunicate, Asian tunicate, leathery sea squirt, or rough sea squirt. As its common names suggest, S. clava is club-shaped with an elongated oval body and a long peduncle for attaching to a substrate. Although native to the northwestern waters of the Pacific Ocean, since the 1900s, S. clava has become an increasingly successful invasive species outside of its native range.  Morphology  S. clava is a solitary tunicate. Including both the club-shaped body and peduncle, larger specimen of S. clava can have a maximum length of around 130 mm (5.1 in) and smaller specimen only reaching 30 mm (1.2 in) in length. Smaller specimen tend to have no distinct peduncle. As described by some of its common names, S. clava has a tough, wrinkled or irregularly grooved skin and comes in two variations of color dependent on size. Larger specimen have a light brown body and a darker brown peduncle while smaller specimen are yellow-brown.  Habitat  S. clava is a marine invertebrate animal. Adults are entirely sessile, growing attached to hard subtidal substrata as deep as 25 meters (82 ft). They can be found on virtually any hard surface such as rocks, buoys, pilings and shells of mussels. S. clava is predominant in the littoral zone, preferring sheltered localities free of strong wave action and floating objects, making artificial surfaces in harbors and marinas exceptional habitat. It is a hardy species that can live in a wide range of temperatures from -2 ‚ÑÉ to 27 ‚ÑÉ and can tolerate high salinity waters (26% - 28% salinity) that would be lethal to other tunicate species.  Reproduction  Like most tunicates, S. clava is hermaphroditic and produces short-lived pelagic lecithotrophic larvae. They reproduce externally via broadcast spawning, and the reproductive period is highly dependent on sea surface temperatures reaching a critical temperature threshold, between 16 ‚ÑÉ and 20‚ÑÉ. The reproductive period can vary from 4 to 10 months depending on location. Along the Californian coast in the United States, the reproduction period occurs for 4 months from June to September, while in Denmark and England, the reproduction period is also 4 months but occurs from July to October.  Native Range  S. clava is native to the northwestern waters of the Pacific, particularly the seas and coasts of Japan and Korea, to Siberia, and as far south as the coasts off Shanghai, China.  Invasions  Outside of its native range, S. clava has proven to be an increasingly successful invasive species due to physiological adaptations and environmental tolerances. S. clava's thick tunic, relative to native tunicates, provides better protection from possible predators and helps prevent desiccation. It can withstand subzero to 23 ‚ÑÉ sea temperatures and high salinity water, giving it strong tolerance to environmental changes in water. The lack of a natural predator already gives S. clava an advantage over native tunicates, but their large size as well allows them to outcompete other filter-feeding species such as oysters or mussels for food and substrate space.  Range  The earliest sighting of S. clava outside of its natural range was on the United States‚Äô west coast in Californian coastal waters in the early-1900s. Since then, the invasive tunicate has spread as far south as Baja, Mexico and as far north as Vancouver Island, Canada. S. clava populations in North America‚Äôs Atlantic waters is believed to have been introduced around the 1970s. In the mid-1900s, the next sighting of S. clava was recorded in European waters in Britain. In the span of 25 years, S. clava populations have expanded their range in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom and to mainland Europe. The current European countries with established S. clava populations are England, Ireland, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, France, Portugal and Spain. Since the mid-1900s, S. clava has been unintentionally introduced globally to temperate coastal waters outside of its native range. It has successfully established stable populations on both coasts of North America, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina.  Vectors  For each region there are multiple pathways by which S. clava could have been introduced. Although not definitive, S. clava's new population distribution is most likely due to anthropogenic vectors. The introduction of S. clava was most likely the result of direct introduction from Japan through shellfish transfers or ship fouling. In Europe, the source of introduction is believed to be from the hulls of military ships returning from the Korean War. As waters are becoming warmer due to climate change, there is concern of habitat expansion into previously unoccupied waters.  Effects  Successful introduction and establishment of populations outside of its natural range can cause dramatic changes in the structure and composition of benthic communities. It is dominating fouling communities, leading to population declines in other filter-feeding species, leading to lower biodiversity. S. clava is a solitary species, but with optimal conditions can reach high densities, up to 500 - 1,000 individuals, fouling man-made substrates resulting in boat and fishing gear difficulties. They also pose a threat to aquaculture, which is being seen in European waters. In Bassin de Thau, France (√âtang de Thau), S. clava is becoming a management problem as they pose a threat to oyster and mussel farming by outcompeting the shellfish for food and substrate space.

Early years George, Lord Seton and his children in 1572, including Margaret, Lady Paisley, Robert Seton, Sir John Seton of Barns and Alexander, Earl of Dunfermline The son of George Seton, 7th Lord Seton, Robert Seton grew up active in the affairs of his father and of the State. He was educated early in France, and accompanied his father during his ambassadorships to France during the reign of Queen Mary. As a youth, he grew up a close childhood friend of the Queen‚Äôs son, the future King James VI. Langside Like his father, he was strongly attached to the Queen and to the Royal House of Stuart, and was part of his father‚Äôs rescue party for Queen Mary from Loch Leven Castle. He was also present at the battle of Langside in 1568. He was later one of the party who rescued King James VI from the hands of the Douglases, and supported his monarch during the Gowrie and other conspiracies of the time. Estates Upon the death of his father, in 1585, Robert succeeded as 6th Lord Seton. Although his father left the estates heavily encumbered by reason of the great expense of several embassies and of his losses suffered by adhering to the Queen‚Äôs party, yet by prudence and ability he was soon able to put his affairs in good condition and provide both sons and daughters with respectable fortunes. He was very hospitable at Seton Palace, where the king and queen, and ambassadors and strangers of quality were nobly entertained.\\"Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1867), p. 659. In August 1594 he was Grand Master of the King's Household at the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle. This state role was usually held by the Earl of Argyll, but he was out of favour.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1593-1595, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 400. When James VI planned to visit the west and the islands of Scotland in August 1598, Lord Seton was made convenor of the Privy Council.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 477. He improved his property, especially by working on the old harbour of Cockenzie, a fishing village of great antiquity on the Firth of Forth, to accommodate vessels of a larger size. In January 1599 the king granted him a charter under the Great Seal of Scotland concerning Cockenzie, which had previously been erected into a free port and burgh of barony. He was a great favorite of James VI, and was created Earl of Winton at Holyroodhouse on 16 November 1600.Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1867), p. 659. Religion A strict Roman Catholic, the Earl and his family suffered indignities from the Presbytery of Haddington, East Lothian, as may be seen by the Records. One entry reads thus: \\"1597. Setoun Kirk. The Presbitery asked Lord Setoun if he will suffer them to sit in the Kirk of Setoun for the space of two or three days, because they are to ‚Äògang about‚Äô all the churches within their bounds; but this his Lordship altogether refused.\\" Protestant worship has never been held in Seton Church, as after the family conformed they attended the Tranent parish church, leaving their own church deserted, as it has remained ever since. Marriage and children In 1582, Lord Seton married Lady Margaret Montgomerie, eldest daughter of Hugh Montgomerie, 3rd Earl of Eglinton, by whom he had five sons and a daughter:Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1867), p. 659. # Robert Seton, 2nd Earl of Winton # George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton # Sir Alexander Seton of Foulstruther, who succeeded as 6th Earl of Eglinton. # Sir Thomas Seton of Olivestob # Sir John Seton of St. Germains # Lady Isabel Seton, who married (1) James Drummond, 1st Earl of Perth, (2) Francis, eldest son of Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell.Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1867), p. 659. Death and burial In his Latter- Will, dated 28 February 1603, the Earl wrote, \\"My body to be buried whole in most humble, quiet, modest, and Christian manner without all extraordinary pomp or unlawful ceremony, within my College Church of Seton among my progenitors of worthy memory.\\" By the words unlawful ceremony, the staunch old Catholic nobleman may have meant that he didn't want any Protestant interference or Kirk rites at his funeral. He was buried on Tuesday 5 April, on the same day that King James VI of Scotland set out from Edinburgh for London to become King James I of England.Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1867), p. 659. The king's company waited at the orchard of Seton Palace until the funeral was over, so that mourners did not leave to follow the king.Maria Hayward, Stuart Style (London, 2020), p. 307. The 19th-century historian Patrick Fraser Tytler imagined the scene: > \\"As the monarch passed the house of Seton, near Musselburgh, he was met by > the funeral of Lord Seton, a nobleman of high rank; which, with its solemn > movement and sable trappings, occupied the road, and contrasted strangely > and gloomily with the brilliant pageantry of the royal cavalcade.

Today, Miacidae is recognized as a paraphyletic array of stem taxa that probably resulted in some \\"miacid\\" genera ending up just outside the order Carnivora, the crown-group within the Carnivoramorpha. Carnivoramorpha consists of both Miacoidea and Carnivora, but excludes the order Creodonta that existed alongside Carnivoramorpha. Miacoids are regarded as basal carnivoramorphs. The miacids are a paraphyletic group containing all miacoids that are not viverravids. The transition from miacids to Carnivora was a gradual trend during the Paleocene to late Eocene, with taxa from both North America and Eurasia involved. The miacids did not appear until the very end of the Paleocene and are characterized by their shorter skull, and loss of contact between the calcaneum and fibula in the ankle. Miacoids were mostly small carnivores superficially reminiscent of martens or civets. They probably fed on invertebrates, lizards, birds and smaller mammals like shrews and opossums, while others may have been insectivores. Some species were arboreal, others lived on the ground.

Scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets and strings and continuo, in four movements: #Allegro #Andante, in F major #Menuetto e Trio #Presto The first movement begins almost like a concerto grosso, but is in fact in a proto-sonata form (with the very brief development carried almost entirely by the violins without accompaniment). The exposition has a repeat, and the development and recapitulation are also marked off by a repeat (which is not always observed). The slow movement is written for strings only, but the continuo is generally understood to continue through; the violas rather than the second violins double the first violins at the octave (Delarte, 2006). The Minuet has no pick-up, the horns and trumpets come to the foreground in the Trio. For the most part, the winds support the strings harmonically. The last movement is a lively rondo with a stronger tendency to F major than to G major.

It is commonly known as the star tunicate, but it also has several other common names, including star ascidian and golden star tunicate. Colonies grow on slow-moving, submerged objects, plants, and animals in nearshore saltwater environments. Description Individual zooids may grow to in size, with colonies reaching long . Tunicate colonies of Didemnum (left) and Botryllus schlosseri (right) overgrowing individuals of the tunicate Styela clava This species can be distinguished from Botrylloides sp. by the pattern of zooid growth. B. schlosseri zooids emanate from a center in the manner of the arms of a star. Also, there usually are fewer zooids per cluster (5‚Äì8 in B. schlosseri and 10 or more in Botrylloides). There are many colors in which this species can be found, ranging from orange, blue and grey. A colony can be easily be separated from the main body to form an independent colony usually referred to as a subclone. Two colonies may also fuse together if they share common alleles for historecognition. Distribution The native range of Botryllus schlosseri is the north eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea. Its range has spread over the last 100 years to a nearly worldwide extent. Ranging in the western Atlantic Ocean from the Bay of Fundy to North Carolina, it is regarded as an invasive species and is \\"the most common colonial tunicate in North America.\\" Biology Botryllus schlosseri is used as a model organism. Clones have been maintained in continuous laboratory culture for several decades, with new adults developing from buds that form from the body wall of existing adults. Under typical culture conditions, asexual reproduction occurs on an approximately two week cycle, during which a new bud will grow and begin to actively feed, while the adult it emerged from regresses and is eventually re-absorbed. When sexually productive, these Botryllus are known to produce,\\"yellowish-white or pale orange tadpole larva\\" exhibiting an oval outline. Colonial tunicates are the only chordates that are able to reproduce both sexually and asexually. B. schlosseri is a sequential (protogynous) hermaphrodite, and in a colony, eggs are ovulated about two days before the peak of sperm emission. Thus self-fertilization is avoided, and cross- fertilization is favored. Although avoided, self-fertilization is still possible in B. schlosseri. Self-fertilized eggs develop with a substantially higher frequency of anomalies during cleavage than cross-fertilized eggs (23.1% vs. 1.6%). Also a significantly lower percentage of larvae derived from self-fertilized eggs metamorphose (51.5% vs 87.2%), and the growth of the colonies derived from their metamorphosis is significantly slower. These observations suggest that self-fertilization leads to inbreeding depression associated with developmental deficits likely arising from expression of deleterious recessive mutations.

He served fourteen years in Parliament but is most known for his contribution to local government where he was Chairman of Merseyside County Council and Deputy Chairman of the Merseyside Development Corporation. Early life Thompson was born in Liverpool and went to Bootle Grammar School. Rather than go to university he became a newspaper reporter for several years, and then went into commerce. During the 1930s he was a lecturer for the pro-free market Economic League. He was also an active member of the Conservative Party and in 1938 was elected to Liverpool City Council. Wartime Due to contracting polio as a child he could not be sent to fight; so during the Second World War Thompson became a civil servant working as a Regional Officer for the Ministry of Information, and remained active in Liverpool. After the end of the war he became a director of several Liverpool companies. Politics At the 1950 general election, Thompson was selected to try to regain the Liverpool Walton constituency for the Conservatives after its loss at the previous election. He won the seat back with a majority of more than 4,000. Thompson retained his seat on Liverpool City Council despite his entrance on the national political stage. He proved a popular Member and was chosen as Secretary of the 1922 Committee after the 1951 election. Thompson's commercial experience was drawn on when he was brought into negotiations on trade with Brazil, which eventually led to a successful reopening of commercial relations. In 1956 he was made Chairman of the Conservative National Advisory Committee on Local Government. Government In 1957 Thompson was brought into the government as Assistant Postmaster General. No longer able to afford the time, he gave up his seat on Liverpool City Council at the next election in 1958. After the 1959 general election he was promoted to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Education. Thompson left the government in Harold Macmillan's \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" reshuffle in July 1962. The next year he received a Baronetcy. Defeat Liverpool as a whole showed a strong swing to the Labour Party at the 1964 general election and Thompson lost his seat to the Labour left-winger Eric Heffer. He wrote a volume of memoirs called \\"Member's Lobby\\" in 1966, followed by \\"Pattern of Conquest\\" the next year. He returned to business but remained involved in politics, and in 1973 was elected to the newly created Merseyside County Council. Merseyside Thompson was chosen to lead the Conservative group in 1974. In the 1977 elections, the Conservatives won majority control and from 1977 to 1981 Thompson served as Chairman of the Council. When the Thatcher government created in 1980 the Merseyside Development Corporation to regenerate the area, Thompson was appointed as Deputy Chairman.

Hooge itself is a small village on the Bellewaerde Ridge, about 4 kilometres east of Ypres in the Flemish province of West- Vlaanderen.

From 1914 the front line of the Salient ran through the Hooge area and there was almost constant fighting in the area over the next three years, during which the village was totally destroyed.Hooge on ww1battlefields.co.uk, accessed 25 April 2015 Hooge was the site of a ch√¢teau which was used by the British Army as the divisional headquarters for the area. Several senior British officers from the 1st and 2nd Divisions were killed when the Ch√¢teau de Hooge was shelled by German units on 31 October 1914. German forces attacked the ch√¢teau from 24 May 1915, and, despite the detonation of a mine by the 175th Tunnelling Company (operating with the 3rd Division) on 19 July 1915, leaving a massive crater, took control of the ch√¢teau and the surrounding area on 30 July. This mine was only the second British offensive underground attack in the Ypres Salient; 173rd Tunnelling Company had blown five mines at Hill 60 on 17 April 1915, but none of these mines were even half as powerful as the Hooge charge.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 148-154, in particular p. 152. Following the detonation of the mine on 19 July 1915, the Ch√¢teau de Hooge and the craters (being strategically important in relatively flat countryside) were taken by the British 6th Division on 9 August. The area was reclaimed by the Germans on 16 June 1916 and retaken by the British on 31 July 1917 when the 8th Division managed to push past it by about a mile. Several large craters from underground mines were blown over the course of the 1917 fighting. The Germans retook Hooge in April 1918 as part of the Spring Offensive but were expelled from the area by the British on 28 September as the Offensive faltered. The Ch√¢teau de Hooge was completely destroyed along with the entire village. Foundation The cemetery was begun in October 1917 by the 7th Division. Originally containing 76 graves, the cemetery was expanded by the concentration of graves from the surrounding battlefields and from nearby smaller cemeteries. The cemetery grounds were assigned to the United Kingdom in perpetuity by the King of the Belgians in recognition of the sacrifices made by the British Empire in the defence and liberation of Belgium during the war. Beneath the cemetery grounds opposite the \\"Hooge Crater Museum\\" are the remains of a deep dugout constructed by 177th Tunnelling Company beneath the Menin Road in the centre of Hooge, occupying the space in between 175th TC's July 1915 mine crater and the stables of the destroyed Ch√¢teau de Hooge.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 150. The current cemetery layout was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and has an unusual feature in the stone-faced circular depression at the entrance that evokes the nearby craters at Hooge, Bellewaerde Ridge and Railway Wood, many of which are now lost. The original Hooge Crater, created nearby on 19 July 1915 by the mine fired by 175th Tunnelling Company, was filled in later in the war as the repository of hundreds of bodies and untenable. The water filled crater visible near the Bellewaarde Hotel today is the result of Baron de Wynck, who landscaped three German mine craters blown in June 1916 as part of their offensive against the Canadians.

Symbiosis Euprymna scolopes lives in a symbiotic relationship with the bioluminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri, which inhabits a special light organ in the squid's mantle. The bacteria are fed a sugar and amino acid solution by the squid and in return hide the squid's silhouette when viewed from below by matching the amount of light hitting the top of the mantle (counter-illumination).Young, R.E. & C.F.

Acquisition The bioluminescent bacterium, A. fischeri, is horizontally transmitted throughout the E. scolopes population. Hatchlings lack these necessary bacteria and must carefully select for them in a marine world saturated with other microorganisms.Effects of colonization, luminescence, and autoinducer on host transcription during development of the squid-vibrio association.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 105(32): 11323-11328. To effectively capture these cells, E. scolopes secretes mucus in response to peptidoglycan (a major cell wall component of bacteria).The evolutionary ecology of a sepiolid squid- Aliivibrio association: from cell to environment. Vie et Milieu 58(2): 175-184. The mucus inundates the ciliated fields in the immediate area around the six pores of the light organ and captures a large variety of bacteria. However, by some unknown mechanism, A. fischeri is able to outcompete other bacteria in the mucus. Adult Euprymna scolopes with scale. As A. fischeri cells aggregate in the mucus, they must use their flagella to migrate through the pores and down into the ciliated ducts of the light organ and endure another barrage of host factors meant to ensure only A. fischeri colonization. Besides the relentless host-derived current that forces motility-challenged bacteria out of the pores, a number of reactive oxygen species makes the environment unbearable. Squid halide peroxidase is the main enzyme responsible for crafting this microbiocidal environment, using hydrogen peroxide as a substrate, but A. fischeri has evolved a brilliant counterattack. A. fischeri possesses a periplasmic catalase that captures hydrogen peroxide before it can be used by the squid halide peroxidase, thus inhibiting the enzyme indirectly. Once through these ciliated ducts, A. fischeri cells swim on towards the antechamber, a large epithelial-lined space, and colonize the narrow epithelial crypts. The bacteria thrive on the host-derived amino acids and sugars in the antechamber and quickly fill the crypt spaces within 10 to 12 hours after hatching.An exclusive contract: Specificity in the Aliivibrio fischeri Euprymna scolopes partnership. Journal of Bacteriology 182(7): 1779-1787. Ongoing relationship Every second, a juvenile squid ventilates about of ambient seawater through its mantle cavity. Only a single A. fischeri cell, one/1-millionth of the total volume, is present with each ventilation. The increased amino acids and sugars feed the metabolically demanding bioluminescence of the A. fischeri, and in 12 hours, the bioluminescence peaks and the juvenile squid is able to counterilluminate less than a day after hatching. Bioluminescence demands a substantial amount of energy from a bacterial cell. It is estimated to demand 20% of a cell‚Äôs metabolic potential. Nonluminescent strains of A. fischeri would have a definite competitive advantage over the luminescent wild-type, however nonluminescent mutants are never found in the light organ of the E. scolopes. In fact, experimental procedures have shown that removing the genes responsible for light production in A. fischeri drastically reduces colonization efficiency. Luminescent cells, with functioning luciferase, may have a higher affinity for oxygen than for peroxidases, thereby negating the toxic effects of the peroxidases.The evolution of bioluminescent oxygen consumption as an ancient oxygen detoxification mechanism.Journal of Molecular Evolution 52(4): 321-332. For this reason, bioluminescence is thought to have evolved as an ancient oxygen detoxification mechanism in bacteria. Venting Despite all the effort that goes into obtaining luminescent A. fischeri, the host squid jettisons most of the cells daily. This process, known as ‚Äúventing‚Äù, is responsible for the disposal of up to 95% of A. fischeri in the light organ every morning at dawn.Breaking the language barrier: experimental evolution of non-native Aliivibrio fischeri in squid tailors luminescence to the host. Symbiosis 51(1): 85-96. The bacteria gain no benefit from this behavior and the upside for the squid itself is not clearly understood. One reasonable explanation points to the large energy expenditure in maintaining a colony of bioluminescent bacteria.Counterillumination in the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes Berry (Mollusca : Cephalopoda). Marine Biology 144(6): 1151-1155. During the day when the squid are inactive and hidden, bioluminescence is unnecessary, and expelling the A. fischeri conserves energy. Another, more evolutionarily important, reason may be that daily venting ensures selection for A. fischeri that have evolved specificity for a particular host, but can survive outside of the light organ.Differentially expressed genes reveal adaptations between free-living and symbiotic niches of Aliivibrio fischeri in a fully established mutualism. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 52(12): 1218-1227. Since A. fischeri is transmitted horizontally in E. scolopes, maintaining a stable population of them in the open ocean is essential in supplying future generations of squid with functioning light organs. Light organ The light organ has an electrical response when stimulated by light, which suggests the organ functions as a photoreceptor that enables the host squid to respond to A. fischeri's luminescence.Tong, D., N.S. Rozas, T.H. Oakley, J. Mitchell, N.J. Colley & M.J. McFall-Ngai 2009. Evidence for light perception in a bioluminescent organ. PNAS 106(24): 9836‚Äì9841. Extraocular vesicles collaborate with the eyes to monitor the down-welling light and light created from counterillumination, so as the squid moves to various depths, it can maintain the proper level of output light. Acting on this information, the squid can then adjust the intensity of the bioluminescence by modifying the ink sac, which functions as a diaphragm around the light organ. Furthermore, the light organ contains a network of unique reflector and lens tissues that help reflect and focus the light ventrally through the mantle. The light organ of embryonic and juvenile squids has a striking anatomical similarity to an eye and expresses several genes similar to those involved in eye development in mammalian embryos (e.g. eya, dac) which indicate that squid eyes and squid light organs may be formed using the same developmental \\"toolkit\\". As the down-welling light increases or decreases, the squid is able to adjust luminescence accordingly, even over multiple cycles of light intensity.

It was associated with the Dolaucothi Gold Mines and its remains lie beneath the adjoining village of Pumsaint in the Welsh county of Carmarthenshire. It lay between similar forts at Llandovery and Bremia near Llanio, and some distance away from the fort at Llandeilo. The Roman road Sarn Helen linked Luentinum with Llanio and Llandovery.  Map of the gold mine Luentinum appears to have been founded as a square 5¬Ω acre (2.25 hectare) Roman auxiliary fort controlling the adjoining gold mines, around AD 75 when Frontinus was governor of Roman Britain and active in subduing the Silures of Roman Wales. The fort had an earthen rampart and double ditch. The date of first construction was determined from a Samian ware inkwell with stamp in the early 1970s where the river bank had cut into the fort. On the east bank of the River Cothi, a few hundred yards south of Pumsaint village was discovered a small double-roomed building with hypocaust and plain tesselated floors. It was probably the military bath-house. The internal buildings of the fort underwent a number of rebuildings until the fort was abandoned around 140. The surrounding civilian vicus then took over the area and, no doubt, also the mines. The fort is situated about halfway between similar forts at Llandovery to the east and Bremia or Llanio to the west, with Llandeilo to the south. The fort was at the meeting point of several Roman roads in mid Wales. These were the Ffordd Fleming which ran from Loventium to Menapia (St David's), the more southerly Via Julia which also came from St David's and met the Sam Helen near Loventium, and the Hen Fford (old road) which came from Maridunum (Carmarthen). The name Luentinum appears only in Ptolemy's Geographia. It appears to be related to the Brythonic word for 'washing', as suggested by George Boon of the National Museum of Wales. It refers to the hydraulic mining methods used on the site for extraction of the gold, and the washing tables used to concentrate the gold dust and nuggets. It is one of the best examples of the application of advanced Roman technology in Britain, and compares with other Roman mines in Europe such as those at Verespatak in Transylvania and Las Medulas in northern Spain. It is a site of international significance and importance. See also * Dolaucothi * Bremia and Llandovery, nearby forts References=CitationsBibliography * .

Seton was known, before his older brother's illness as \\"George Seton of St Germans\\". His Catholic tutor Stephen Ballantyne was criticised by the Presbytery of Tranent and the elders of Haddington forced his removal. Two more Catholic tutors were dismissed after pressure from the Kirk. The Seton brothers, like many other Scottish aristocrats, completed their education in France.David Matthews, Scotland under Charles I (London, 1955), pp. 217-8. His elder brother Robert Seton, 2nd Earl of Winton, had no issue, and resigned the Earldom on 26 June 1606, to George, who continued the developments that his brother and father had begun at Seton Palace, and later, in 1630, at Port Seton, as well as throughout the many estates under his control in both that county and Linlithgowshire. In 1619 he built the mansion house of Winton near Pencaitland, the earlier tower house having been burned in the English invasion of the Earl of Hertford, and restored the park, orchard, and gardens around it. When King James VI of Scotland revisited Scotland in 1617, he spent his second night, after crossing the River Tweed, at Seton Palace, and King Charles I was twice entertained there, with all his retinue, in 1633. War of the Three Kingdoms In 1639, at the commencement of the Scottish rebellion against the Crown, Lord Winton left the country and waited upon King Charles I after the pacification of Berwick to offer his loyal services, for which the rebels did him great injury; and thereafter all through the Civil Wars he was constantly harassed: > \\"Cromwell and his army of cavalry domineered in all parts where they came, > and in especial about Edinburgh, and in East Lothian. The good Earl of > Winton, to whose well-furnished table all the noblemen and gentlemen had > ever been welcome, was pitifully abused by them; his fair house of Seaton > made a common inn; himself threatened to be killed, if they had not > whatsoever they called for; his rich furniture and stuff plundered, and all > the enormities that could be offered by Jews or Turks to Christians, he > suffered daily; and when he complained to those of our nobility who now rule > all, he got no redress, but [was] ordered with patience to give them > whatsoever they called for.\\" When James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose was in command of the Royal forces in 1645, the Earl's eldest son, George, Lord Seton, joined him, and was taken prisoner at the disastrous battle of Philiphaugh and remained long \\"in hazard of his life\\". George, Lord Seton died before his father, in 1648. George, Earl of Winton, entered into the 'Engagement' for the rescue of His Majesty in 1648, giving ¬£1000 sterling to the Duke of Hamilton, the commander-in-chief, in free gift for his equipage. Like his father, the Earl suffered a long series of petty persecutions from the Presbytery of Haddington because of his allegiance to the Roman Catholic faith. For instance, on 4 November 1648, the Presbytery ordained \\"a purge the House of Setoun of 'Popish servants', and to proceed both against them and against the Earl of Wintoun if he protect or resset them after admonition.\\" When King Charles II came to Scotland in June 1650, the Earl of Winton was in continuous attendance on him, and continued with His Majesty until November. He then went home to Seton to prepare for his attendance at the Coronation, but died on 17 December of that year. Family His first wife, Lady Ann Hay Lord Winton was twice married: (1) Lady Ann, eldest daughter of Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll and Elizabeth Douglas, daughter of the Earl of Morton, they had five sons and three daughters, of whom: * George, Lord Seton (d.1648) * Alexander Seton, 1st Viscount of Kingston * Elizabeth (1621‚Äì1650), married in 1637 William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal. By his second wife, Elizabeth, only daughter of John Maxwell, 6th Lord Herries of Terregles, Lord Winton had six sons and six daughters, of whom: * William * Christopher, regarded as a great scholar. These two brothers and a preceptor, while going \\"on their travels abroad, were cast away at sea upon the coasts of Holland in 1648\\". * John * Robert * Ann, married at Winton House in April 1654, to John Stuart, 2nd Earl of Traquair, by whom she had three sons and one daughter, Elizabeth, who died \\"a brave hopeful young lady\\", at twenty years of age.

He was involved in a number of projects supported by Russell, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), the Committee of 100 and an unofficial war crimes tribunal to try American leaders for their conduct in the Vietnam War. Shortly before his death in 1970, Russell publicly broke with Schoenman. Life Ralph Schoenman (centre right) alongside Bertrand Russell and Edith Russell, leading an anti-nuclear march in London, Feb 1961. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Schoenman was educated at Princeton University but then left the U.S. for Britain in 1958. He was involved in various protest activities during his student days and became active in the CND after arriving in Britain. This brought him into contact with Russell, for whom Schoenman began working in 1960. Bernard Levin wrote critically of Schoenman's influence on the aged philosopher, painting Schoenman as partly responsible for Russell's virulent anti-Americanism, in contrast to his earlier pronouncements against communism.Levin, Bernard. \\"Bertrand Russell: Prosecutor, Judge and Jury\\".

In 1963, Schoenman participated as Russell's secretary in attempts to mediate a solution for the Sino-Indian border conflict, after China declared a ceasefire the previous year. For visiting communist China, the U.S. embassy in London put him under a travel restriction, stamping his passport as only valid to return to the U.S.\\"U.S. Curbs Russell's Aide\\".

New York Times, January 13, 1967, p. 2. In addition to the group's own camera crews, Schoenman tried to negotiate network television coverage from NBC and CBS for the tribunal's visit to Hanoi, but was turned down in a dispute over the conditions. The networks charged that they had been asked to pay for the privilege and also felt that the restrictions proposed to them, including submitting footage for censorship, would imperil their objectivity. CBS News president Richard Salant said, \\"They are out to prove a point with investigations and they have an ax to grind\\".Dallos, Robert E. \\"2 Networks Spurn Russell 'Court' Bid\\". New York Times, February 16, 1967, p. 1.

(Note: i.p.h publications no:74, Islamic Publishing House, Calicut, Kerala, India). Shaikh Kutty earned a scholarship to study at the Islamic University of Madinah, Saudi Arabia, from where he obtained his Licentiate in Usul al-Ddeen (first rank passing at the top of his class in 1972). In 1972, he arrived in Canada with a scholarship to pursue his M.A. in Islamic studies from the University of Toronto. He went on to further his doctoral studies at the McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies where he earned scholarships (from 1975 to 1980) to pursue his research under the supervision of Professor Charles Adams and Prof. A. √úner Turgay.\\"Professor A. Uner Turgay\\" The Institute, established in 1952 by Wilfred Cantwell Smith, is the first institute of Islamic studies in North America. During a visit to India in 1976, an arrest warrant was issued for Shaikh Kutty under The Emergency (India) declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi‚Äôs administration mainly (for his translation work with Islamic Publishing House and Probodhanam Weekly, the mouthpiece of Kerala Jamaate). In India, \\"the Emergency\\" refers to a 21-month period in 1975‚Äì77 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi unilaterally had a state of emergency declared across the country. Officially issued by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed under Article 352(1) of the Constitution for \\"internal disturbance\\", the Emergency was in effect from 25 June 1975 until its withdrawal on 21 March 1977. His son Faisal Kutty recounts as one of his earliest childhood memories as running from safe house to safe house, until the family was able to leave India. In 2003, Shaikh Kutty made international headlines when he and Imam Abdul Hamid were detained and held in a Fort Lauderdale jail after disembarking from their flight on 11 September. The two were travelling to Florida to speak at an Islamic conference. He is a well- known scholar, preacher and speaker on Islam and Muslims. He was also one of the first and most vocal imams to condemn the terrorist attacks on the twin towers in the same day in a Friday Sermon at the Islamic Center of Toronto. Furthermore, among the topics to be discussed at the conference in Orlando was the dangers of extremism and fanaticism. After returning to Canada, Shaikh Kutty asked: Career Shaikh Kutty served as an Imam in various mosques and Islamic centers in Montreal during his McGill days. He then held the following positions: * 1973‚Äì1975: Assistant Director: Islamic Center of Toronto * 1979‚Äì1982: Director/Imam: Islamic Center of Toronto * 1984‚Äì1995: Director/Imam Islamic Foundation of Toronto * 1996‚ÄîResident Scholar & Senior Lecturer, Islamic Institute of Toronto He has also been a khatib (preacher) at various centers/mosques in Toronto including the Islamic Center of Canada, Islamic Center of Toronto, Masjid Toronto, Tariq Mosque, etc. Shaikh Kutty has served on the Fiqh Council of North America, the pre-eminent Islamic law body on the continent. He has served as Imam and resident scholar at various institutions in Montreal and Toronto, including Toronto's Jami Mosque and the Islamic Foundation of Toronto. He is currently resident scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto. He is a prolific writer and has written a number of articles, books and journal articles. He was a regular scholar answering Islamic law questions on IslamOnline and OnIslam.net, and presently on AboutIslam.net and AsktheScholar.com. In addition to his participation in lectures, seminars and inter-faith dialogues in North America, Shaikh Kutty is invited as a guest speaker in functions all over the world. His Fatwas have been translated into a number of languages, including French, Bengali and Malayalam. Initially a sympathizer of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and Abul A'la Maududi and a proponent of the Salafi movement, he has become disillusioned by these movements and now calls for return to the spiritual message of Islam √† la Imam Ghazali. He propounds a flexible approach to Islam in contemporary times. His speech to the Students Islamic Organisation of India Kerala annual conference in 2012 focusing on the crisis in the Muslim world is illustrative of his view and approach.\\"ISLAMIC ACADEMIC CONFERENCE SIO KERALA (2012) ‚Äì Shaikh Ahmad Kutty\\" Shaikh Kutty was one of the 120 imams across Canada who signed a statement condemning acts of terrorism.

Through his father's influence, in 1639 he married Lady Henrietta Gordon, daughter of the Marquess of Huntly, with whom he made a great match and by whom he had four sons, of whom George succeeded his grandfather as fourth Earl of Winton, and the others died young or without issue. Seton showed great military abilities and was firmly attached to the Royalist cause. The family estates flourished under his stewardship, his father providing many opportunities to learn and excel at managing the family affairs, during the many troubles of the 17th century. Seton suffered great hardships at the hands of the rebels during the English Civil War, and his father had to sell long-held family estates in Linlithgowshire, that of Niddry Castle and one at Winchburgh, to rescue him from imprisonment. He died at Seton Palace on 4 June 1648, prematurely and unexpectedly of an illness probably caused by his imprisonment, predeceasing his father.

He was the son of George Seton, Master of Winton and Henrietta Gordon, a daughter of George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly. He was in Europe for his studies, a boy of under ten years of age, when he succeeded his grandfather in the family estates in 1650. Notwithstanding his youth, a heavy fine of ¬£2000 was imposed on him by Cromwell's Act Of Grace and Pardon in 1654. His tutor and uncle was Lord Kingston, by whom he was brought up \\"in the true Protestant religion\\", thus severing the long attachment of his family to the Catholic Church. On 19 June 1656, Lord Kingston reported to the Haddington Presbytery by order of the Synod that Lord Winton had hitherto been educated in the Protestant Religion and his education should still be carefully attended to. Lord Winton was accomplished in the knowledge of arms, and gave proof of his skill and gallantry serving with the French army at the siege of Besan√ßon in 1660. Returning to England with a brilliant reputation he was well received by King Charles II, who appointed him a member of the Privy Council of Scotland, and give him command of the East Lothian Regiment of Foot against the Covenanters in 1666, following which he defeated the rebels at Pentland, and also, in 1679 he again commanded the same regiment \\"upon his own charges, with all his vassals, in noble equipage, in his Majestie's army of 14,000 men\\", at Bothwell Bridge, were the rebels were totally defeated.

As a learned individual, Professor Sinclair presented him with a curious and rare work entitles Satan's Invisible world discovered - or A choice collection of relations anent devils, spirits, witches, and apparitions in 1685. The lengthy 'Epistle Dedicatory' is in a vein of exaggerated praise, somewhat relieved by a description of the Earl's coal-mining operations, in which Sinclair introduces the name of Athanasius Kircher, the Jesuit, who founded the Kircherian Museum in the Roman College, at Rome, and was one of the first natural philosophers and scientists of the age. In 1691-93 he was in Holland, at Amsterdam and at Leyden, where he met travellers and learned men in whose company he delighted, as he was much given to mathematics and physical science. This Earl did much to improve his property and to benefit the public. He built a new harbor at Cockenzie, called Port Seton, which still exists by this name, and has recently revived with Edinburgh people as a modest summer resort. Alexander Nisbet says of this nobleman that \\"he imitated the extraordinary loyalty of his ancestors; none of them having ever been guilty of treason or rebellion, nor addicted or avarice, nor found with lands of the Church in their possession\\".

The 1790 New Fairfield census listed two Gideon Hubbell households, one near Parruck Hubbell and one a little farther away; the latter Gideon Hubbell (1726‚Äì1807) was probably Ephraim Hubbell's younger brother.

She was the daughter of Samuel Barnum Sr. (1697‚Äì1764) and Rebeckah Cornell (c. 1697 ‚Äì before 1757), a grand-daughter of Francis Barnum (1671‚Äì1736) and Emm Fairchild (1672‚Äìc.1707),Francis Barnum served as an Ensign in King Philip's War.Eben Lewis Barnum in \\"Genealogical Record of the Barnum Family\\", 1912, p.8, mistakenly shows Deborah Hoyt as Francis Barnum's first wife, implying that she conceived their eldest son Isaac when she was 12 years old. This highly unlikely linkage has been copied over the years and is repeated in a number of websites. We do have a record of them being married by 28 Feb 1712, but not by 1707 when Francis' youngest child, Emm, was born. There appears to be no evidence at present to refute that Francis Barnum's actual first wife, Emm Fairchild, was the mother of all his children. and a great-granddaughterSarah Barnum was also the great-granddaughter of John Cornell Sr. (1634‚Äì1705) who came from Essex, England with his parents in 1635 to Boston. His parents, Thomas Cornell (1593‚Äì1655) and Rebecca Briggs (c. 1600 ‚Äì 1673), then settled the family in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and what is now Westchester, New York where they were driven out by Indians with much bloodshed. After returning to Portsmouth, John Cornell married Mary Russell (1644 ‚Äì c. 1701) in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, where they settled until driven out by Indians in King Philip's War. They were rescued with their children and brought as refugees to Cow Neck (Sands Point), Long Island, New York where they were granted acreage and remained for the rest of their lives. Their son John Cornell Jr. married Mary Starr in Hempstead, New York and the couple moved to Fairfield, Connecticut, where Rebeckah was born, before settling in Danbury.

Also, A History of the County of Westchester, by Robert Bolton, 1848, Google Books, Appendix, p. 554,556.In addition, Sarah Barnum was the great-great-granddaughter of Thomas Fairchild Sr.(1610‚Äì1670) and Emma Seabrook (1621‚Äì1659), who were among the first settlers of Stratford, Connecticut. As an example of a woman's name passing down through the generations, note that Sarah Barnum reportedly had a sister named Emm Barnum (c. 1717 ‚Äì 1764) (wife of Joshua Barnum), an aunt named Emm Barnum (c. 1707 ‚Äì c. 1750) (sister of Samuel Barnum Sr. and wife of Joseph Boughton), a grandmother named Emm Fairchild (1672 ‚Äì c. 1707) (wife of Francis Barnum and daughter of Thomas Fairchild Jr.), and a great-great-aunt named Emm Fairchild (1673‚Äì1732) (sister of Thomas Fairchild Jr, daughter of Emma Seabrook, and wife of Hachaliah Preston).

Sarah Barnum Hubbell apparently died sometime between 1770 and 1780.Her youngest child was born in 1770.As of April 4, 1781, the ‚ÄúJohn Cornell estate owed money to Parruck‚Äù [heir of Sarah Barnum, who was an heir of her mother Rebecca/Rebeckah Cornell, who was the wife of Samuel Barnum Sr. and daughter of John Cornell Jr.]. Notes by Ruth Ryan, in library of Hubbell Center, Des Moines, Iowa, cited LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, FHL microfilm 0004025, Danbury Probate Records 1775‚Äì1790, Vol. 4, p. 197-98. However, the debt also could have been merely for some business transaction with Parruck. Sometime after 1772, Parruck married Lydia Beardsley (c. 1740 ‚Äì c. 1794), who became stepmother to all his children. (Parruck Hubbell and Lydia Beardsley had no known children.)There appears to be no contemporaneous public record of Lydia Beardsley before 1772 when she was mentioned as an unmarried daughter in the will of her father, John Beardsley, Jr. [FHL film 4024, Vol. 3, pages 154:155] and again in 1788, when she was mentioned in Parruck Hubbell's will, and also in 1791 in a codicil to his will. Note that all of Parruck Hubbell's children were born before 1772. Parruck Hubbell's children were first mistakenly assigned to Lydia Beardsley in 1881 by Walter Hubbell in his 'History of the Hubbell Family' entry for \\"Parnach\\" Hubbell, p. 260. But he was unaware of Parruck's first wife, Sarah Barnum, and he provided no sources for his information. Isaac Haight Beardsley listed Lydia Beardsley married to Parruck Hubbel in his 'Genealogical History of the Beardsley/lee Family', 1902, p. 233-234, but listed no children and gave no sources. Nellie Beardsley Holt in her 'Beardsley Genealogy', publ. 1951, p. 32, mistakenly listed Lydia Beardsley married to \\"Parnack\\" Hubbell with the five children, but provided no sources for her information. The 'DAR Patriot Index' of 1966, p. 351, listed Ensign \\"Parrach\\" Hubbell married to Lydia Beardsley, but with no children included, no pension indication, and no source given. H.B. Hubbell's 'Additions & Revisions to History & Genealogy of the Hubbell Family', 1995, p. 32, 73, lists Ezra Hubbell born c. 1756, which definitely would make him the son of Sarah Barnum. The source is given as Ruth Ryan research. Note that the date of Sarah Barnum's death has not yet been discovered (as of February, 2009), but it is now confirmed that Sarah Barnum was the mother of all of Parruck Hubbell's children. She was the daughter of John Beardsley Jr. (1704‚Äì1772) and Martha Odell (1708‚Äì1797).Lydia Beardsley (c. 1740 ‚Äì c. 1794) had five brothers and two sisters; they were Mary Beardsley Comstock (c. 1729 ‚Äì 1772/3), Col. Nehemiah Beardsley (1731‚Äì1811), Serajah Beardsley (1733‚Äì1758), Anne Beardsley Bishop (1741‚Äì1759), Dr. Ebenezer Beardsley (1746‚Äì1791), Dr. Hezekiah Beardsley (1748‚Äì1790), and Dr. Gershom Beardsley (1752‚Äì1826). Hezekiah Beardsley and his wife Elizabeth Davis are subjects of paintings in the Yale University collection. They adopted their niece Sarah Davis, apparently the daughter of Elizabeth's brother Isaac Davis. Hezekiah bequeathed 30 pounds and a woman's saddle to Lydia in 1790 per Walter B. Steiner, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, vol. 6, no. 4, 1934, pp. 367-374. Parruck and Lydia were second cousins; their great-grandfather was Samuel Beardsley (c. 1636 ‚Äì 1706), son of William Beardsley (1605‚Äì1661) of Derbyshire, England who was a founder of Stratford, Connecticut.Nellie Beardsley Holt, Beardsley Genealogy, The Family of William Beardsley, privately published 1951, p. 32. (Digital copy). (Book does not include sources, but appears to reference original documents.) After Lydia‚Äôs death, Parruck remarried again at about age 64; his third wife Abigail was admitted to the New Fairfield Congregational church on January 3, 1796.LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, FHL microfilm 0005351 Both Parruck and Gideon were active in the Congregational church, serving on various committees over the years. Parruck Hubbell died in January, 1819; his widow Abigail Hubbell apparently died two or three years later.Parruck and Abigail Hubbell were listed in the New Fairfield census in 1800 under the name of \\"Paruch Hubbell\\" and in 1810 under the name \\"Park Hubbell\\".Danbury Probate Court appointed Gideon Hubbell to be executor of Parruck's estate on February 11, 1819. Abigail Hubbell was awarded her widow's dower on March 6, 1819, which was then distributed to the other heirs on July 9, 1823, presumably after her death. FSL film 4029, Vol.13, p.332-336,350,460. FSL film 4030, Vol.14, p.404-405 (Danbury Probate Records, 1810‚Äì1828).  Gideon's militia service in the American Revolutionary War  Shortly after his 16th birthday in 1777, Gideon Hubbell served in the Connecticut Militia, on loan for a month to the Horseneck garrison in Greenwich, as a Private in the Company commanded by Captain Turrell in Colonel Canfield's Regiment. From September to November, 1777, Gideon marched with his home Regiment along the Hudson River to oppose General Burgoyne's assault from Canada; this was in Captain Peter Penfield's Company of the 16th Regiment, which was commanded by Colonel Cook. (General Burgoyne surrendered his army at Saratoga, New York, before Gideon's Regiment could reach the scene.) In July, 1778, Gideon marched with the same Company and Regiment under the same command to the huge Fishkill Military Supply Depot in New York, a tour that lasted three weeks. In July, 1779, Gideon served two weeks with his home Regiment (by then under the command of Colonel Nehemiah Beardsley) in the defense of Fairfield and Norwalk, which were under attack by British General Tryon; Gideon was still in Captain Penfield's Company for this. In 1780 or 1781, Gideon served two months again on loan to the Horseneck garrison under the command of Colonel Mead and Captain Dean.Gideon Hubbell Revolutionary War Pension Application #S31763, dated June 30, 1834  Gideon's sister and brothers  Gideon Hubbell had three brothers and a sister, all born in Danbury, Connecticut and moving as a family to New Fairfield in 1771.

Gideon's brother Noah Hubbell (1767‚Äì1824) married Anna Hoyt Barnum (1764‚Äì1847) and they apparently spent their life in Danbury, Connecticut except for a farming period around 1800 at Middlefield, New York.1800 census for Danbury, Connecticut and Middlefield, New York. Gideon's youngest brother Elijah Hubbell (1770‚Äì1847) married Hannah Fields (1764‚Äì1837) in 1792 and moved to Middlefield, New York where they spent the rest of their life farming.Harold B. Hubbell & Roscoe L. Hubble, Additions & Revisions to History & Genealogy of the Hubbell Family, Publ. The Hubbell Family Historical Society, 1995, p.32,74.  Gideon's first and second wife  Gideon Hubbell married during the American Revolutionary War and settled with his wife Anne Bishop (1759‚Äìc.1795) in New Fairfield, where they had three children; Gilead, Billy, and Anna. Anne Bishop was the daughter of Bille Bishop (1735‚Äì1789) and Anna Beardsley (c.1738‚Äì1759), sister of Lydia Beardsley. Gideon Hubbell's first wife was undoubtedly Anne Bishop (February 3, 1759 - c.1795), daughter of Billy Bishop, usually written Bille Bishop, (1735‚Äì1789) of New Fairfield, as evidenced by the use of his first and last names for Gideon's son and grandsons. Billy/Bille Bishop's wife, Anna Beardsley (c. 1738 - 1759), was probably Lydia Beardsley's sister (per the will of their father, John Beardsley, Jr. dated May 13, 1772, where he mentioned his deceased daughter Anna Beardsley as Anna Bishop). She died three days after giving birth to their daughter, according to New Fairfield Congregational Church records. Billy/Bille Bishop was born May 8, 1735, in Woodstock, Connecticut, according to Records of the First Congregational Church there and lived in New Fairfield in 1759. He was buried in Center Cemetery, Norfolk, Connecticut, where his headstone reads \\"Bille Bishop, Died June 17, 1789, Age 54, Revolutionary War\\". Bille's infant daughter Anne (Gideon's future wife) was probably nursed by her aunt Mary Beardsley Comstock (c.1729‚Äìc.1772) who moved with her husband Samuel Comstock (1729‚Äì1764) and children from New Fairfield to Norfolk, Connecticut around 1760. (She returned to New Fairfield in 1765 with the children after Samuel's death.) Bille Bishop, at age 26, and his second wife, Mamre Gaylord (1735‚Äì1817), the 26-year-old widow of John Gillett (1729‚Äì1760), were married on October 15, 1761 at Norfolk, Connecticut, where she may have been living with her parents.Billy/Bille Bishop was a great-grandson of Edward and Sarah Bishop, who were imprisoned as witches in 1692 at Salem, Massachusetts, but escaped to New York and then moved with their entire family to Roger Williams' original settlement, Rehoboth, which is now Rumford, a part of Rhode Island. The 1790 census for Bethlehem, Connecticut lists a Billy Bishop household located among Bishop relatives, but this was most likely William H. (Billy) Bishop, a loyalist who went to Canada in 1793.Notes by Ruth Ryan, in library of Hubbell Center, Des Moines, Iowa, ‚Äú2511 Parrock of New Fairfield ‚Ä¶ February 11, 1819‚Äù, copied from Connecticut State Records (Folio 332 cited): ‚ÄúParruck Hubbell's will dated March 28, 1788 provides to wife Lydia and daughter-in-law Ann, wife of Gideon.‚Äù Codicil dated Feb 2 or 12, 1791, names \\"my wife Lydia\\" and \\"dau-in-law Anne, wife to my son Gideon\\".

Gideon's children and grandchildren  Gilead Hubbell (also spelled Hubbel or Hubble), Gideon‚Äôs oldest child, was born about 1780.It is possible that he was named after another Gilead Hubbel, born before 1760, who served in Captain Benedict's Company of Colonel Bradley's Regiment, was taken prisoner in the defeat at Fort Washington on November 16, 1776 and presumably died a few months later with most of his comrades in a British Prisoner of War Camp in New York.

Copy in library at The Hubbell Center, Des Moines, Iowa. http://www.hubbell.org/hubcent.htmIf Gilead Hubble was working on water mills in Cape Girardeau County in 1822, he almost certainly would have met Ithamar Hubble (1762‚Äì1840), a colorful distant relative who had a mill on Hubble Creek at present-day Gordonville, Missouri. Ithamar was born in Newtown, Connecticut and grew up in Albany County, New York, where he enlisted in 1779 as a private in the Revolutionary War. After the war, by 1787, he had moved to southwest Virginia. He then trekked to Cape Girardeau in 1797 when it was still Spanish territory, where he received a grant of , six years before the Louisiana Purchase. (He and his companions presumably drove a wagon train up the rough but newly widened Wilderness Road to Louisville, Kentucky and then rode on flatboats down the Ohio River to Missouri.) His mill was still operating a hundred years later.Harold B. Hubbell & Roscoe L. Hubble, Additions & Revisions to History & Genealogy of the Hubbell Family, Publ. The Hubbell Family Historical Society, 1995, p.848. He left a widow, five sons and a daughter.Gilead Hubbell‚Äôs children were: Parruck/Park Hubbell (April 30, 1805 ‚Äì January 27, 1883) cabinet maker and carpenter, Daniel Jefferson Hubbell (December 30, 1807 ‚Äì June 21, 1887) carpenter and wagon maker, William Bishop Hubbell (August 4, 1810 ‚Äì October 13, 1896) soldier and farmer, Sarah Hubbell (c.

Gilead‚Äôs daughter Sarah married Henry Gibson (1812‚Äì1893), a stonecutter from Kentucky, and was living next door to her mother in 1840. Park, Daniel, and William were born in North Carolina, Sarah and Napoleon in Tennessee, and James in Missouri. All died in Tennessee except Daniel, who moved around 1870 to Frankfort, Kentucky, where he operated a wagon making establishment.Census 1850, 1860, 1870, 1880.

For some reason, early Hubbells migrating south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line tended to change the spelling of their name to Hubble. Gilead's children did so also, but his sons eventually reverted to the original spelling. Gideon‚Äôs younger son, Billy B(ishop?)

Hubbell had daughters Merilla Hubbell and Lucy Hubbell; he had an infant son named Bishop Hubbell (1821‚Äì1822), but his surviving sons were Bishop Beebe Hubbell (1823‚Äì1905) of Olean, New York and Gideon J. Hubbell, also known as J.G. Hubbell (1826‚Äì1888) of Groton, New York. In addition to father Billy and son Bishop identifying themselves as B.B. Hubbell, there was a third B.B. Hubbell living nearby. This was a distant relative, Burton B. Hubbell (1816‚Äì1906), the postmaster of East River at Cortland, New York, who was probably the grandson of Matthew Hubbell (1745‚Äì1812) and Abigail Burton (1758‚Äì1812) of Easton, Connecticut and son of Andrew Read Hubbell (1771‚Äì1854) of Otsego County, New York. Billy became a farmer at Virgil, New York, in the Finger Lakes region, and lived there for the rest of his life. He was still listed in the Virgil census of 1880 at age 94.The 1880 Virgil, NY census listed Lucy and Billy B. Hubbell living with his grandson J. B. Hutchings and wife Mary [Booth]. John B. Hutchings (1840‚Äì1909) was the son of Andrew Hutchings (1816‚Äì1889) and Merilla Hubbell (1813‚Äì1890). He had been named as a co-executor in Gideon‚Äôs will of 1830, but it is not known whether he was able to return from western New York to Connecticut to participate in the 1838 estate settlement.Joseph T.

Hubbell's wife Sarah as the sister of Joseph T. Bearss, but with no source provided. In this case, the mother of Joseph T. Bearss and Sarah Bearss was Jemima Beebe (1759‚Äì1833), born in New Fairfield. Jemima Beebe was the wife of Sgt. Joseph Bearss 2nd (1756‚Äì1834) and the daughter of deacon Joseph Beebe (1724‚Äì1803); she was also a great-granddaughter of Captain James Beebe (1641‚Äì1728), a co-founder of Danbury, Connecticut. He was probably the son of Sgt. Joseph Bearss 2nd of New Fairfield, who served in the Revolutionary War and who lived next door to the young married couple in 1810.Also living next door to Joseph Bearss 2nd [age 54] in the 1810 census was Joseph Bearss 3rd [age 22], a cousin or possibly a brother of Joseph T. Bearss [age 20]. Also living nearby was Thomas Bearss [age 72], who was the son of Josiah Bearse and the father of Joseph Bearss 2nd. Farther away was Joseph Bearss 1st [age 76], another son of Josiah. (Joseph Bearss 3rd became Joseph Bearss Jr. in the 1820 census and he is listed with his second wife Caroline at Crawford County, Pennsylvania in the 1850 census.) Joseph T. Bearss was listed as \\"Thomas Bearss\\" in the 1820 and 1830 census of New Fairfield. (Note that the ancestry.com digital database for the 1810 census has the town names scrambled for northern Fairfield County, Connecticut; but their original images are correct, of course, with the town names given at the END of each list.) The two Josephs were descendants of Josiah Bearse Sr. who moved from Barnstable, Massachusetts to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1734 and then to New Fairfield in 1738, two years before the town was incorporated.

Josiah was a grandson of Augustine Bearse, who immigrated in 1638 at age 20 from Southampton, England to Plymouth aboard the ‚ÄúConfidence‚Äù and came to Barnstable with the first group in 1639.

Gideon Hubbell‚Äôs will stipulated that the bulk of his estate was to be shared equally by his wife Diantha, son Billy, and daughter Anna, with a small amount reserved for the children of his deceased son Gilead. This led to an inventory of all his real and personal property after his death. As executor, it fell to Joseph T.

Bearss reportedly moved with eight of their children around 1841 to Catawba Island in Ottawa County, Ohio, on the edge of Lake Erie, where they planted extensive orchards. Joseph died there in 1845, but Anna lived on to the age of 90 in 1883. As a final note, their eldest son Gideon Hubbell Bearss (born 1815), who had apprenticed in 1831 as a shoemaker in Putnam County, New York, followed them in 1844 to Catawba Island, where he also became a prosperous land owner.Commemorative Biographical Record of the Counties of Sandusky and Ottawa, Ohio: Containing Biographical Sketches of Prominent and Representative Citizens (Google eBook) J.H.

Bearss family had nothing to do with producing the Bearss Persian lime, the commercial green lime now found in supermarkets everywhere. John T. Bearss (1847 ‚Äì c. 1920), whose relationship (if any) to them is unknown, developed this lime tree in his nursery at Porterville, California, per 'Culture of the Citrus in California', by B. M. Lelong, 1902, page 236. He later worked at the University of California Agricultural Experiment Station at Tulare. He was born near Battle Creek, Michigan and was a horticulturist in Wisconsin before moving to California. His father Daniel Bearss (1804‚Äì1878) was born in Livingston County, New York, per census records and 'History of Northern Wisconsin', 1881, page 648. Note that H.J. Webber in 'The Citrus Industry', 1943, page 624, transposed John's initials from J.T. Bearss to \\"T.J. Bearss\\", an error that has been copied to a number of web sites dealing with limes.‚ÄúDuring the War of 1812 General Harrison had men stationed on Catawba Island to prevent a possible English invasion, and some of these may have settled down as permanent residents. Most of the American settlers, however, came from Connecticut to take up land given them as compensation for houses and barns burned by the English during the Revolution. In 1792 the State of Connecticut granted about 500,000 acres (2,000 km¬≤) of land at the western end of Connecticut Western Reserve to these people, and the area came to be known as the \\"Fire Lands‚Äù. The ‚ÄúFire Lands‚Äù could not be settled immediately: the claimants or their heirs had to be found, the amount of damage they suffered verified, the land had to be surveyed, purchased from the Indians (1805), and was finally granted to individuals in 1807 by means of a complicated lottery.‚Äù http://www.catawbaislandtownship.com/CatI2-Historical.htm accessed February 15, 2009.From \\"Lake Erie Islands\\", editor Michael Gora, Trafford Publ. 2004, page 356: Google Books. \\"Catawba Island -- Additional biographies, 1881: ... -- \\"George W.

The Parsonage  Abel F. Beardsley took residence of The Parsonage as a manufacturer of lightning rods. Most of the town's records burned in a fire at the town clerk's home in 1867, so the exact date of the Beardsley house is unknown. Experts can place it somewhere around 1840 with parts of it being perhaps earlier. The property went through successive owners until Lavenia Jennings sold it to the Congregational Church of New Fairfield in 1903 for $1,000. It was then used as the pastor's home, The Parsonage, until the 1950s - half a century! The Parsonage was also used as a meeting place for educational, charity and social events. According to the Danbury Evening News on September 9, 1908, \\"A number of ladies met at the Parsonage yesterday afternoon for the purpose of organizing a Ladies Aid Society.\\" In the early 1900s, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) met in the parlor of The Parsonage. Years later, a woodworking club for boys was offered there with the pastor serving as instructor and shop steward. Girls in town would attend the Hobby Club. The building also served as an informal teen center in the 1940s and 1950s.

The airport is named after 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche, an Indian statesman and monk, whose Spituk Monastery is in direct vicinity to the airfield. Due to the presence of mountain winds in the afternoon, all flights take off and land in the morning. The approach is challenging as it is unidirectional and has high terrain towards the eastern end of the airport. Airport security is tight with Indian Army patrols. Due to its location in between the Himalayas, the approach to Leh Airport has been named as one of the world's most scenic approaches. In February 2016, it was reported that the Indian Air Force has handed the airport to Airports Authority of India and AAI will expand it for civilian purposes. But those reports of IAF vacating the entire air base were dismissed by Ministry of Defence and Leh Deputy Commissioner. They clarified that the IAF would vacate only a small part of land for construction of a new terminal. Construction of new terminal began in February 2019 with schedule completion in September 2021.

Captured by the English, Seton was tried and sentenced to death, but escaped and lived the rest of his life in exile. Early life Seton was originally brought up to assume his rightful place as head and heir of line of the Seton Family. To this end, his father bestowed upon him the Barony and Lordship of Seton at a very early age, and provided for him well, so that he would be educated at the best schools in Europe. Unfortunately he was not disposed to entertaining, as the many generations of the family had been, nor did he express an interest in the political affairs of his country until later in his life which caused his father great distress and grief and for which created a rift in the family. With this, George left to travel Europe and into a life of somewhat obscurity. For a time, he worked as a blacksmith's apprentice in Flanders, though he maintained contact with the doings of the family through a confidential servant in the Seton household back in Scotland. He was abroad on his travels when his parents died, and \\"no man knew where to find him, till accident led to the discovery.\\" Macky's memoirs say that he \\"was at Rome when his father died.\\": and did not return to Scotland until several years after his succession to the earldom, much to the detriment of his house and estate, which were dilapidated by sundry kinsmen during this protracted absence. He seems, like all his family, to have been given study and researches of some kind, and to travel; and in 1708 Robert Calder, a minister of the Episcopal Church of Scotland, dedicated to him his edition of the Genuine Epistles of the St. Ignatius. 1715 rebellion He was one of the first Scottish noblemen who played an active part in the \\"Rising\\" of 1715, to restore the exiled family to the throne. \\"He took with him three hundred men to the standard of James Stuart; but he appears to have carried with him a fiery and determined temper, the accompaniment, perhaps, of noble qualities, but a dangerous attribute in times of difficulty.\\" The Seton family, as we have seen, had always been noted for their loyalty and their attachment to the old Church, and the last Earl, though he had renounced the Catholic faith, held firmly to the political creed of his ancestors. He was living peaceably in his own mansion at Seton when the rebellion of 1715 broke out. His involvement in the rebellion was hastened by the treatment which he received from a body of the Lothian militia, who forcibly entered and rifled his mansion at Seton, as he alleged on his trial, 'through private pique and revenge.' 'The most sacred places,' he adds, 'did not escape their fury and resentment. They broke into his chapel, defaced the monuments of his ancestors, took up the stones of their sepulchres, thrust irons through their bodies, and treated them in a most barbarous, inhuman, and unchristian like manner.' After this event the Earl took up arms against the Government, assumed the command of a troop of horse mostly composed of gentlemen belonging to East Lothian, and joined the Northumbrian insurgents under Mr. Forster and the Earl of Derwentwater. Their numbers were subsequently augmented by a body of Highlanders under Brigadier Macintosh, who formed a junction with them at Kelso.James Taylor, The Great Historic Families of Scotland, The Setons (1886) The English insurgents insisted on carrying the war into England, where they expected to be reinforced by the Jacobites and Roman Catholics in the northern and western counties. The Scotsmen proposed that they should take possession of Dumfries, Ayr, Glasgow, and other towns in the south and west of Scotland, and attack the Duke of Argyll, who lay at Stirling, in the flank and rear, while the Earl of Mar assailed his army in front. The English portion of the insurgent forces, however, persisted in carrying out their scheme in spite of the strenuous opposition of the Scots, and especially of the Highlanders, who broke out in a mutiny against the English officers. The Earl of Winton disapproved so strongly of this plan that he left the army with a considerable part of his troop, and was marching northward when he was overtaken by a messenger from the insurgent council, who entreated him to return. He replied that 'It shall never be said to after generations that the Earl of Winton deserted King James's interests or his country's good.' Then, laying hold of his own ears, he added, 'You, or any man, shall have liberty to cut these out of my head if we do not all repent it.' But though this young nobleman (he was only twenty-five years of age) again joined the insurgent forces, he ceased henceforward to take any interest in their deliberations or debates. The Rev. Robert Patten, who officiated as chaplain to the insurgents, and afterwards wrote a history of the rebellion, indeed states that the Earl 'was never afterwards called to any council of war, and was slighted in various ways, having often no quarters provided for him, and at other times very bad ones, not fit for a nobleman of his family; yet, being in for it, he resolved to go forward, and diverted himself with any company, telling many pleasant stories of his travels, and his living unknown and obscurely with a blacksmith in France, whom he served some years as a bellows-blower and under-servant, till he was acquainted with the death of his father, and that his tutor had given out that he was dead, upon which he resolved to return home, and when there met with a cold reception.' Capture and trial The Scottish army, having advanced into England against Lord Winton's advice, capitulated at Preston, in Lancashire, after a fierce engagement on Monday, 14 November 1715. The Earl fought with great gallantry at the barricades of Preston, but was at last obliged to surrender along with the other insurgents, and was carried a prisoner to London, and confined in the Tower. He was brought to trial before the House of Lords, 15 March 1716, and defended himself with considerable ingenuity. The High Steward, Lord Cooper, having over-ruled his objections to the indictment with some harshness. Among the seventy-five \\"prisoners of quality\\" who surrendered there were, besides the head of the family, George Seton of Barnes, titular earl of Dunfermline, and Sir George and lodged in the Tower. He was tried apart from the other noblemen, having pleaded \\"not guilty\\" ‚Äì only one to do so, as it would have been unworthy of a Seton to acknowledge himself (even constructively) as a traitor and throw himself on the mercy of the King George. The other Scottish Lords were the Earl of Nithsdale, Earl of Carnwath, Viscount Kenmur, and Baron Nairn. The young Earl of Derwentwater, an English Catholic involved in the same catastrophe, having pleaded \\"guilty\\" at his trial, (which, however, did not avail to save him) was induced by a priest who attended him on the scaffold, and hesitated giving him absolution, to retract the plea. This he did. To plead \\"guilty\\" was looked upon by strict theologians as a repudiation of one's lawful sovereign ‚Äì James III. Lord Winton defended himself with spirit and ability; but, of course, was condemned to death. It was 19 March 1716. His sentence was such a foregone conclusion that he laughed in the face of the Lord High Steward, who presided ‚Äì Sir William, (afterward Earl) Cowper, telling him: \\"I hope you will do me justice, and do not make use of Coupar-law, as we used to say in our country. 'Hang a man first and then try him.'\\" He was punning on the name of Cowper, which was pronounced Cooper the same as Cupar, the Fife town, which was also sometimes written Cowper. To understand this joke, one must know the old cross of MacDuff, in Fife, was a famous sanctuary and that those \\"claiming the privilege of the Law of Clan MacDuff were required to appear afterwards before judges assembled at Cowper in Fife.\\"; but by a sort of anticipatory Lynch Law, the criminal or suspected criminal who had run to the Cross did not always (after leaving the sanctuary) live to reach Cupar and have a fair trial; he was hanged before he got there. Lord Winton's character was very original, and he was calumniated by enemies and misunderstood by friends, as though his plea and defence, so peculiar to himself, were signs of an unbalanced mind. Sir Walter Scott refutes these insinuations: \\"But, if we judge from his conduct in the rebellion, Lord Winton appears to have displayed more sense and prudence than most of those engaged in that unfortunate affair.\\" While lying in the Tower under sentence, a trusty servant managed to furnish him with a file or other small instrument (some say it was only a watch-spring), with which he contrived to cut through the window bars in his cell and escaped. This was on Saturday, 4 August 1716, about 9 o'clock at night. The earl got safe to France, and ultimately made his way to Rome. Exile and death Among the manuscripts preserved in the archives of the Grand Lodge of Scotland are the Minutes of a Lodge of Scottish Freemasons existing in Rome in the years 1735, 1736 and 1737, from which we find that the Earl of Winton was himself admitted a Mason under the name (which he assumed on his attainder) of George Seaton Winton at a meeting held at Joseppe's, in the Corso, Rome, on 16 August 1735.Hughan, The Jacobite Lodge at Rome, 1735-7, The Lodge of Research, Leicester, 1910. He is supposed to have died there, unmarried, on 19 December 1749, when over seventy years of age. One of the last accounts of him was as follows: \\"Walked two hours with Lord Dunbar in the gardens, and afterwards went to the coffeehouse to which Lord Winton resorted and several of his stamp, and there fell a-singing old Scots songs, and were merry.\\" Male cadets of this family, however, came by intermarriage to represent the great historic families of Huntly and Eglinton, besides the ducal house of Gordon, now extinct, and the Earls of Sutherland, whose heiress married the Marquis of Stafford, afterwards created Duke of Sutherland. The earldoms of Winton and Dunfermline, the viscounty of Kingston, and the other Seton titles were forfeited for the adherence of their possessors to the Stewart dynasty, and have never been restored; but the late Earl of Eglinton was, in 1840, served heir-male general of the family, and, in 1859, was created Earl of Winton in the peerage of the United Kingdom. It is not well known where Lord Winton is buried, although several of his name and family have made search. In two oral traditions which converge substantially to the same conclusion it is related that he returned to Scotland in disguise, and died there unknown, except to very few; the other, that he died in the Catholic faith, in obscurity, at Ormiston. Some writers have said empathetically that he died a Protestant. \\"Thus terminated\\", says Sir Robert Douglas, \\"one of the principal houses in Great Britain, after subsisting for upwards of 600 years in east Lothian, and from thence spreading into several flourishing branches in Scotland.\\" References * Attribution Earls of Winton 1678 births 1749 deaths People of the Jacobite rising of 1715 Scottish prisoners sentenced to death Scottish politicians convicted of crimes Scottish Freemasons ","title":"George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton"},{"id":"9547534","text":"Adrian Gabriel Rivera (April 7, 1961 ‚Äì July 16, 2018) was an American college and professional football player who was a nose tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for a single season in 1983.

Despite his weight, Rivera was able to complete a 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds as a noseguard. While at Texas Tech, he earned the nickname \\"Se√±or Sack\\". Rivera finished his four-year career at Texas Tech with 321 tackles, 34 tackles for loss, 14 sacks, 11 pass deflections, and 6 fumble recoveries. His 1982 total of 105 tackles still holds the school record for most tackles by a defensive tackle. Rivera garnered significant national attention following a 10-3 loss against the #1 ranked 1982 Washington Huskies football team, in which he logged 10 tackles, 4 pass deflections, 4 quarterback pressures, and a sack. In 1980, Rivera earned honorable-mention All-American honors as a sophomore. In 1982, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American as a senior defensive tackle. Additionally, Rivera was named the Southwest Conference Defensive Player of the Year, and would later be named to the Southwest Conference All-Decade team. He appeared in the 1982 Bob Hope Christmas Show and was introduced as an All American Defensive Lineman. He was named to the National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame in May 2012. He was named as the fourth member of Texas Tech's Ring of Honor on July 2, 2014 and had his name inscribed on Jones AT&T; Stadium along with fellow College Football Hall of Fame members Donny Anderson, Dave Parks and E. J. Holub. NFL The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Rivera in the first round (21st pick overall) of the 1983 NFL Draft. Rivera's selection was notable because the Steelers decided to pass on hometown hero and University of Pittsburgh quarterback Dan Marino as heir apparent to Terry Bradshaw. Instead, head coach Chuck Noll chose to rebuild from the defensive side as the team had done a decade earlier with \\"Mean Joe\\" Greene. Rivera was considered to be one of the fastest defensive linemen coming out of college. As the 1983 season progressed, Rivera slowly began to come on, getting two sacks in his first six games played. But on October 20, 1983, Rivera was paralyzed in a car wreck. Driving while drunk, he crossed into another lane and collided with another vehicle. The then 22-year-old was treated for head, neck, chest and abdominal injuries, as well as significant memory loss. The crash occurred at 9:00 p.m. in Ross Township, a northern suburb of Pittsburgh. At the time, Rivera was married to Kimberly Covington; they had son Timothy Rivera three weeks later, in November.

In an era in which male singers predominated, she was a pioneer as a woman singer in the genre: she was the first woman in East Africa to record her music in an album. In contrast to previous singers who sang in Arabic, she sang in Swahili. She sang in cities of the coast of Tanganyika and Zanzibar. The peak of her career was from 1928 to her death in 1950, during which she recorded over 150 gramophone records in India. Subsequent to her death, more women singers appeared in formerly all-male singing clubs. History Siti binti Saad was born in the village of Fumba, Zanzibar in 1880. She was given the name of 'Mtumwa' (slave) because she was born during the Arab enslaving period. Her father was Saadi, from the Nyamwezi tribe from Tabora, and her mother was from the Zigua tribe from Tanga; both were born in Zanzibar to very poor families and were engaged in agricultural activities and pottery manufacture that Siti herself learned and mastered well. As the Swahili say \\"being born poor isn't dying poor\\". Sita was blessed with the special gift of singing. In her early life, she used singing to sell her mother's pottery: her singing voice could travel a distance of many miles, signalling that Mtumwa's pottery was being sold that day. Siti was said to have the lungs with great strength like a lion's. Since at that time education for female children wasn't taken seriously, Siti wasn't able go to school nor attend Koranic studies. So she decided to move to the city to better her life. She had the fortune to meet a member of the taarab group Nadi Ikhwani Safa named Ali Muhsin. At that time, Nadi Ikhwani Safa was the only taarab group founded by Sultan Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar, who loved comfort and luxury. It was an all-male group, as it was seen as indecent for women to join musical groups. Lord Muhsin volunteered to teach Siti to sing, accompanying musical instruments and Arabic. He then introduced her to the other members of Nadi Ikhwani Safa who without hesitation began to organize various performances for her in the community. They received many invitations, especially from the Sultan and other rich Arabs, and to perform at various weddings and other celebrations. As time went by, Siti's fame grew. In 1928, Columbia Records and His Master's Voice heard the fame of Siti binti Saad and so they invited her and the group to record, in Swahili, at their studio in Mumbai. The company could not believe how the music was selling since the average player managed to sell 900 recordings during the first two years, but up to 72,000 were sold in 1931. Due to the spread of this album, Siti's popularity brought people from around the world to Zanzibar. Things got even better for Siti once Columbia Records decided to build a music recording studio in Zanzibar. Siti continued her musical activities until old age. Shortly before her death she met the famous writer and poet Shaaban Robert, who interviewed her to write her biography in a book he called Wasifu was Siti binti Saad. This biography is thought to be among Tanzania's greatest literature and is taught in secondary school in Tanzania. On July 8, 1950, Siti binti Saad died leaving a huge gap in the field of taarab. Although a gap that cannot be filled, there are many people who continue to sing in her style. Until her death in 2013, the pre-eminent exponent was Bi Kidude. Siti binti Saad rose from the oppressed classes to make taarabu music her vehicle, calling for social justice in what is now Tanzania. She protested against class oppression and men's abuse of women; her song \\"The Police have Stopped\\" sharply criticized a judge who let a rich wife-murderer go free. She seemed unafraid even of the sultan. Even after her death, her name is still widely used as a model for bravery. The Association of Women Journalists Tanzania (TAMWA) named their party newspaper Voice of the Siti. To this day Siti is used as a measure of teaching taarab.

Career When he arrived at Wichita State, he inherited a program that had been dormant for over seven years. In his first year, despite not playing a home game until their 18th game, his Shockers finished with a winning record. In his third year, they made the first NCAA Tournament appearance in school history, and in his fifth they advanced all the way to the title game. The team, with four first team All-Americans (seven overall), lost to Miami. This was all the more remarkable considering that until 1984, they played at a bare-bones stadium with only a tiny bleacher section for seating. The momentum from their 1982 title game appearance helped spearhead the building of a permanent facility, Eck Stadium, in 1985. Under his leadership, the Shockers made seven College World Series and 26 NCAA tournament appearances, including 14 straight from 1987 to 2000. His teams never had a losing season. His 1982 team went 73‚Äì14, establishing an NCAA record for single-season wins. Stephenson won his first CWS championship in 1989; also in 1989, the Shockers won 24 consecutive games. Stephenson was suspended in 1999 for his part in the Anthony Molina incident. Molina was due to lead off an inning for the University of Evansville. As pitcher Ben Christensen warmed up on the mound, Molina took practice swings 24 feet from home plate. Wichita State's coach, Gene Stephenson, taught his pitchers to \\"brush back\\" on-deck hitters standing too close. Christensen threw a pitch at Molina's head, the unsuspecting victim looked up just as the ball collided with his face. Molina was taken to the hospital and treated for his injuries. The hitter's vision fell from 20/10 to 20/400. Prior to coaching at WSU, he served as an assistant coach at Oklahoma. During that tenure, the Sooners won five league championships, and went to five College World Series. For most of the day on July 10, 2005, Stephenson was the head coach of Oklahoma. Several hours after accepting the job, however, Stephenson decided to remain at Wichita State, reportedly due to scholarship issues at Oklahoma. After 36 years, Stephenson was fired on June 4, 2013.Chronicling 36 years with Gene Stephenson at Wichita State; The Wichita Eagle; June 4, 2013.Sexton says Stephenson‚Äôs 36-year tenure could‚Äôve ended differently; The Wichita Eagle; June 4, 2013.

He had better luck playing baseball, however; as a first baseman under legendary coach Hi Simmons, he was an All-American in 1967. Stephenson served a three-year stint in the United States Army, spending one year in Vietnam. Gene has two children, Jay and Ginny. His younger brother is Phil Stephenson, who played under him from 1980 to 1983. Gene and Phil were inducted into the Guthrie High School Hall of Fame in 1994.

His early interests in baseball derived from the Sunday afternoon games he attended with his father. After graduating from Morris High School in the Bronx, he worked in several jobs while developing a deep interest in baseball history, rules, and statistics. By the 1930s he was spending a lot of his free time in the New York Public Library researching old newspapers about the early accounts of matches. At that time, he developed a friendship with Ernest Lanigan, a baseball historian and Information Director of the International League. Simmons worked for the International League from 1945 until 1966, first in New York then in Montreal. He then worked in the Baseball Commissioner's office until his retirement in 1982. He developed the playing schedules for the Majors and various minor leagues for over 20 years. Known as a historian and writer, he did much original research into 19th Century baseball. He developed and wrote the weekly feature \\"So You Think You Know Baseball,\\" which ran in the Saturday Evening Post from 1949 to 1961. His book of the same name was a best-seller. For many years he wrote the entry for baseball in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In 1951, Simmons testified as an expert witness to the Celler Committee hearings on the history of the reserve clause. At the 1979 baseball winter meeting in Toronto, he was honored as \\"King of Baseball\\". Awards In 1990, his contributions to the game were recognized when he received the SABR Salute. In 2002, he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame,Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, List of Inductees and in 2007, he was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Israel.  Historian, author  During the 1930s, Simmons developed a deep interest in baseball statistics and history. He was the first to compile 19th Century National League won-lost records for pitchers. The guides of that period had not published this information. He carefully checked each box score of each game listed in the newspapers of that era: Sporting Life and The Sporting News. The results were published over several issues of Baseball Magazine. From 1940 to 1942, Simmons selected the top baseball performer of the day for the popular radio show \\"Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians.\\" While in the army he continued his research and while at Camp Pickett, Virginia, was able to work at the Library of Congress in Washington, where he compiled records from 1876, debuts of prominent players, batting records of pitchers, rare fielding gems and items for the Sporting News record book. He contributed original work to the top baseball writers of the day: J. G. Taylor Spink, Leonard Gettlson, Hy Turkin, S. C. Thompson, and Lee Allen. He studied Journalism at Columbia University in New York on the GI bill after leaving the army. In 1951, Simmons was called as an expert witness to testify before a congressional committee on the history of the reserve clause. The Celler House Judiciary committee probed monopoly influences in organized baseball. In 1968 Simmons contributed a 26,710 word essay on the topic of Baseball which was printed in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica for many years.  International League (1946 - 1966)  Simmons joined the International League during the 1946 season. On his first day on the job, Frank Shaughnessy asked him to go to Baltimore to present an award to Sherm Lollar for leading the league in hitting in 1945 with a .364 average. Simmons hopped on a train and in front of 45,000 fans made the presentation that afternoon. He indicated that he was extremely nervous speaking in front of a crowd that size. That year, Jackie Robinson joined the Montreal Royals, and Simmons became quite involved in handling the press in its hunger for stories about the great player. Over the years he gained more responsibility in handling player trades, dealing with the press, scheduling the games, the hiring, firing and movement of the umpires, settling disputes among the clubs, handling the financial side of league operations, and staffing the office. During the late 1950s Shaughnessy became frequently ill, and Simmons was essentially running the league by himself. In 1952, the league office was moved to Shaughnessy's home town of Montreal. Simmons quickly became a popular figure in Montreal baseball circles and gave many speeches to local community groups. He made many close friends among the sports writers and sport figures in both Montreal and Toronto. He moved his family north in 1954 to settle in the suburb of Cartierville, Quebec. The family retained this residence until 1995. When the Montreal Royals folded in 1960, the league office moved back to New York City, but Simmons decided to keep his residence in Montreal. He would regularly spend 3 days a week in Montreal until his retirement from the Commissioners office in 1981.  Commissioner's Office His official duties in the Commissioner's office included supervision of club player contracts, co-ordination of National League and American League retirement plans, player service and pension records. He frequently was called upon for advice from the Commissioner and wrote speeches for the many functions attended by Commissioners William Eckert and Bowie Kuhn. He acted as a general consultant to club owners and general managers who needed advice. As Jim Fanning, former General Manager of the Expos, wrote: \\"During Mr. Simmons time as a baseball executive every Major League owner and executive knew him on a first name basis. He not only was a keen advisor to the commissioners he worked for, but was a counsel and advisor to Major League Executives as well. Mr. Simmons was unheralded - his picture never made the cover of The Sporting News - but I had an office next to his when I started the Major League Scouting Bureau, and I witnessed this man's contribution day after day. His contributions were an equal to any who graced the cover of a sports magazine.\\"  \\"So You Think You Know Baseball\\"  When Simmons started at the International League, he held conferences for the umpires of the league to discuss the rules and review calls which had been made. He soon realized that some of the umpires were of the opinion that they \\"don't have to know the right answer unless the managers do\\". He started to compile some of these odd plays which the umpires would ask him about, and in 1949, he submitted \\"a pack of these nutcrackers\\" to the Saturday Evening Post under the title \\"So You Think You Know Baseball\\". The series became very popular; one of the solutions brought 7,000 letters of protest to the magazine. Nearly all were actually plays, \\"though a few were the results of bad dreams\\". The series ran until 1961, and later was published in Baseball Digest. In 1962, the series was published in book form and sold 500,000 copies in many editions. Scheduling One of Simmons' tasks at the International League was to develop the league schedule. In March 1953, when the Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee, Warren Giles called on Simmons for some quick schedule changes. The next year found him developing both the American and National League schedules. He was the major league schedule maker from that date until 1982, when the required travel started to take its toll. He also completed the schedules for numerous minor leagues, the Canadian Football League, soccer leagues, and international hockey tournaments. Role in organizing the Montreal Expos Since Simmons had many friends in the baseball circles in Montreal, and knew everyone of importance in the game, it was only natural that he was called upon for assistance when Montreal was ready for a major league franchise. He directed Gerry Snyder of the mayor's office on how to go about getting the franchise and recommended the hiring of Jim Fanning and John McHale to run the club.  Other functions and accomplishments  For many years, Simmons served on the Major League Rules Committee, where he suggested changes and wrote new rules. In 1965, he appeared in the CBS Television show To Tell The Truth and managed to receive no votes when asked, \\"Will the real Mr. Simmons please stand up\\". In 1979, Simmons was awarded the \\"King of Baseball\\" title at the annual Baseball winter meeting held in Toronto. This prestigious award is given annually to an individual who has made a major contribution to Major League baseball. It was generally felt that it was appropriately given to Simmons in Canada. In 1990, he was awarded the SABR Salute which is given to a member whose research has contributed significantly to baseball knowledge. He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002, and in 2007, was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Israel. The Harry Simmons Collection at the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame In the more than 50 years that he was involved in baseball, Harry Simmons collected thousands of items related to the development of the game from earliest times. These included his correspondence with people involved in every level of the game; memos, letters, and speeches from the commissioners office from the 1920s to the 1980s; notes and memos from his days as the major league schedule maker, letters from fans of his \\"So You Think You Know Baseball\\" series; articles from the International League; a significant collection of baseball memorabilia, and a major collection of baseball publications and books. The collection was donated in 1998 to the CBHF&M; by his son, David Simmons, who is a resident of Toronto. It has been called one of baseball's most eclectic, exciting and diverse collections. The collection is housed in the Harry Simmons Memorial Library which was opened on April 25, 2019.

Communities along the brook include Edwards, Carlsbad Springs, Bearbrook, Cheney, and Bourget. The BearBrook area was first colonized in 1824. Bearbrook Village's Postal Office (in the General Store) was opened in 1855 with John Walsh being named the first post master. Bearbrook Station was established when the train station was built. Parish of Trinity Anglican was formed in 1863 in a wooden church centrerd in the village of Bearbrook. Trinity Anglican Stone church was built in 1900. st School SSNo.4 Southwest of Bearbrook, also served Navan near the corner of what is currently Russell rd and Forcedrd. In the mid 19th century, during the early days of colonization, the Bear Brook was used by loggers for floating timber to sawmills, a few of which operated in Carlsbad Springs from 1854 to 1905. It was also used by settlers for transportation to their homesteads. However the brook was too small and dry in the summer, and its use for transportation was quickly discontinued upon completion of Russell Road. All the surrounding mature forests have been logged, and consequently the brook drains faster.Gloucester Historical Society See also *List of rivers of Ontario  References  External links  * https://ottawa.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1001796026 * https://ottawa.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1001796026 * http://web.ncf.ca/cv297/cumberland.html * http://www.cths.ca/ * http://www.bytown.net/bearbrook.htm * http://geneofun.on.ca/cems//ONRUS13821 * http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM389935&R;=389935 * http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM2289150&R;=2289150 * http://www.craigmyle.ca/?p=1141 Rivers of Ottawa Tributaries of the Ottawa River ","title":"Bear Brook (Ontario)"},{"id":"9547710","title":"Wang Nuea District"},{"id":"9547722","text":"Solanum xanti, known commonly as chaparral nightshade, purple nightshade, and San Diego nightshade, is a member of the genus Solanum.

V. Vinayak. It stars Nandamuri Balakrishna, Shriya Saran, Tabu in the lead roles and music composed by Mani Sharma. The film opened to mixed reviews and was finally graded as an above average grosser at the box office. Plot Bharat (Balakrishna) is a sincere and dedicated police officer in Mumbai. In a short span of time, he is regarded as a fearless officer who could single- handedly bring the guilty to justice. Preethi (Shreya) is a medico and daughter of Police Commissioner Prasad (Vizag Prasad). She falls head over heels for Bharat, but this does not make any difference to the story line of the present stream of faction backdrop movies. Meanwhile, another super cop, Sivakrishna, working in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, becomes a person in the news as a daring and dashing police officer who never bows his head to politicians. Inevitably, Sivakrishna becomes an irritation to local faction leader, Dhanunjaya Reddy (Anantraj), who runs a parallel government in that region. When Sivakrishna falls victim to the political clout of Dhanunjaya Reddy, he is demoted and transferred to Tihar Jail as a lower rank officer. In between is shown a statue of Chenna Kesava Reddy, who is considered as a man of high respect in the region and has been missing for the past 22 years. Sivakrishna finds Chenna Kesava Reddy in Tihar Jail, having been imprisoned for some false case. Sivakrishna makes every effort to get Chennakesava Reddy released. When Chennakesava Reddy returns to his village after 22 years, he is pompously welcomed by one and all. Chenna Kesava Reddy halts the factionist activities of Dhanunjaya Reddy and his henchmen. After knowing of the return of Chenna Kesava Reddy, his wife and son come to see him. Now the movie turns to the flashback, in which Chennakesava Reddy is shown as a generous and the most revered man in the village, but has a rivalry with Venkata Reddy (Jayaprakash Reddy). In one of the worst incidents between the rivals, Chennakesava Reddy's rivals hack his entire family members to death. When their bid to kill Chennakesava Reddy falls short, they wangle some false case against him and send him to Tihar Jail. However, Chennakesava Reddy's wife Sita (Tabu) and younger son Bharat (Balakrishna) escape the attack by Venkata Reddy and his men with the help of his followers and reach Mumbai. Chenna Kesava Reddy starts taking revenge on his rivals one after the other and there happens to be none to dare Chenna Kesava Reddy in Seema. In order to counter him, Dhanunjaya Reddy gets Bharath posted in Seema. The movie continues with the son chasing the father to arrest the father, moving ahead in his mission of revenge.

His Medal of Honor, awarded in November 1973, was the last presented by President Richard Nixon. Camp Bondsteel, located in Kosovo, is named in his honor. The northbound bridge over the Knik River along the Glenn Highway north of Anchorage, Alaska, where Bondsteel died in a freak traffic collision, is also named in his honor. Biography James Leroy Bondsteel was born in Jackson, Michigan to Betty Jean Daisy and her fiancee, Kenneth Bondsteel. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1965 after graduating from Jonesville High School in Jonesville, Michigan. He was sent to Korea, where he contributed his time to an orphanage. Once he had finished his stint in the Corps he joined the United States Army, serving from 1965 to 1985. From 1966 to 1970 he was assigned to Company A, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. He received the Medal of Honor for his most heroic actions, which occurred on May 24, 1969 near An L·ªôc, South Vietnam during Operation Toan Thang III. From 1970 to 1973 he was stationed in West Germany. After his retirement from the Army as a Master Sergeant, he worked as a veterans' counselor. He lived in Willow, Alaska with his wife Elaine and his daughters, Angel and Rachel. Bondsteel died on the Knik River bridge of the Glenn Highway in 1987 when a trailer full of logs came unhooked from the transport which was pulling it and slammed into the front of his AMC Spirit. A tree was placed at Freedoms Foundation Park at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in his honor. Bondsteel is buried in Alaska at Fort Richardson National Cemetery. There is a monument to him at the Alaska Veterans Memorial at Byers Lake on the Parks Highway in the Denali State Park. Camp Bondsteel, the main U.S. Army base in Kosovo, is named in his honor. Bondsteel, along with three other Medal of Honor recipients who were from the area, is honored on the Medal of Honor Memorial in Jackson County, Michigan, dedicated on November 22, 2011.

He was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1943, and received a BA in English from Harvard College in 1965. In 1968‚Äì1973, while living in Tarzana, California, he designed and built an all-metal, two-seat, single-engine low-wing monoplane. The design was influenced by the T-18 of John Thorp and the PL-2 of Ladislao Pazmany, both California airplane designer/builders.

It was notable for unusually long range and for Mr. Garrison's lack of academic qualifications for designing it. With his companion, television documentary producer Nancy Salter, Mr. Garrison used the aircraft to fly to Europe, Japan and South America.

Peter Garrison test-flying the as-yet unpainted Melmoth in 1973. Yarn tufts on fuselage reveal air flow over wing. The horizontal tail was later moved to the top of the vertical tail. In 1981 he began design work on an enlarged fuselage for Melmoth. In 1982, however, the original airplane was destroyed at Orange County (California) Airport (now John Wayne) when a landing Cessna collided with it. The completely redesigned Melmoth 2 first flew in 2002. It is constructed of glass- and carbon-fiber-reinforced composites and has four seats; the rear seats face aft, an arrangement that reduces the required cabin size and center-of-gravity range. The airplane, which has retractable landing gear, large hydraulically operated Fowler flaps and a 200 hp turbocharged Continental engine salvaged from the first Melmoth, is based at Whiteman Airport in Los Angeles. Like its predecessor, it has a cruising range of more than 3,000 miles. Peter Garrison is a free-lance writer. He contributes two monthly columns, Aftermath and Technicalities, to Flying magazine, for which he has written since 1968. With David Pinella, he co-founded AeroLogic, a company that creates and sells computer software programs to analyze fluid dynamics. Mr. Garrison has 4,000 hours of flight time. He holds a single-/multi-engine commercial pilot license with instrument, Learjet, helicopter, seaplane, glider, gyroplane and hot-air balloon ratings. He is the great-grandson of the Armenian author Muratsan. He and Ms. Salter have a son, Nicholas, born in 1981, and a daughter, Lily, born in 1988.

History of Muslim States The early Muslim conquests began in the lifetime of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. His successors conquered large swaths of the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to part of Southern Europe and the Indian subcontinent. In the decades after his death, the caliphate founded by his earliest successors, called the Rashidun caliphate, was succeeded by the Umayyad caliphate and later the Abbasid caliphate. While the caliphates gradually fractured and fell, other Muslim dynasties rose; some of these dynasties grew into Islamic empires, with some of the most notable being the Safavid dynasty, Ottoman Empire, and Mughal Empire.

He has written eleven books on the subject of Irish history, and co-authored another. Ferriter attended St. Benildus College in Kilmacud in Dublin and University College Dublin. Career Ferriter is Ireland's best known historian and is Professor of Modern Irish History at University College Dublin, a position he was appointed to in 2008 at the age of 35. He was formerly a senior lecturer in history at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin City University. He was the host of What If, the popular Sunday morning radio programme that broadcast weekly on RT√â 1 from 2003-2009, and also presented RTE's History Show from 2011-13.. His 2004 book The Transformation of Ireland 1900‚Äì2000, at 900 pages and containing many new perspectives on modern Irish history, was considered a landmark publication. In 2007, Ferriter wrote the critically acclaimed biography, Judging Dev. This was an insight into one of Ireland's most influential leaders, √âamon de Valera. It won in three categories of the 2008 Irish Book Awards, an achievement that remains unmatched. He was Burns Scholar at Boston College from 2008 to 2009. His 2009 book Occasions of Sin: Sex and Society in modern Ireland is considered the definitive history of Irish sexuality in the twentieth century and was described by the Sunday Times as a \\"rigorous, empirical and layered examination of a topic that befuddled Irish people for most of the last century\\".Amazon reviews. In June 2010, he presented a three- part television series The Limits of Liberty, about how the senior politicians of the Irish Republic and Irish Free State were more concerned about holding on to power than changing policy for the benefit of the people.The limits of liberty page (and see also Families in the Oireachtas). He has collaborated closely with Emmy award-winning producer Nuala O'Connor; their 2018 film Keepers of the Flame deals with the legacy of the Irish revolutionary period of the early twentieth century. Ferriter's book, Ambiguous Republic: Ireland in the 1970s, published in November 2012, considers the widespread social, cultural, economic and political upheavals of the decade, a time when the Northern Irish Troubles profoundly affected the governance of the Republic, when Ireland joined the EEC, when for the first time a majority of the population lived in urban areas, and when economic challenges abounded. The 1970s in Ireland also witnessed an increasingly visible feminist movement, and the political and legal establishments and other powerful institutions including the Church began to be subjected to a new criticism. In 2013, Ferriter played a leading role in the Democracy Matters group that successfully campaigned against the government's proposal to abolish the Irish Senate; the proposal was defeated in a referendum in October 2013. In 2014 he became a weekly columnist with Ireland's leading quality broadsheet newspaper, The Irish Times. In 2015, Ferriter published his account of the revolutionary years of the early twentieth century in A Nation and Not a Rabble: The Irish Revolution 1913-1923. Based on new sources and perspectives, it was acclaimed by the Irish Independent as \\"magisterial\\", and \\"giving voice to history's silent souls\\". Ferriter's book The Irish Border: The Legacy of a Century of Anglo-Irish Politics was published in February 2019 to critical acclaim in both the UK and Ireland and became a bestseller. The Times hailed it as \\"a rare pleasure\\" suggesting that anyone who wanted to understand why Brexit was proving such an intractable difficulty needed to read this book; the Irish Independent described it as a \\"deft history of the problem child nobody wants\\" while it was hailed in The Irish Times as \\"invaluable\\". In March 2019, Ferriter was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy. RIA. Bibliography *A Nation of Extremes; the pioneers in twentieth-century Ireland.

TV career Following her grand approval in 2008 Beijing Olympic Concert Eugenia Manolidou decided to start a TV career. She was originally supposed to participate either as a judge for the 1st season of The X Factor (Greek TV series) or as the hostess of the legendary morning show Œ†œÅœâŒπŒΩœåœÇ ŒöŒ±œÜŒ≠œÇ i.e. \\"Morning Coffee\\". However the broadcasting channel ANT1 thought it would be more intriguing for her to be hostess of the Greek version of The Moment of Truth (U.S. game show) reality show. They turned to be right as Moment of Truth in 2009 made a huge impact on Greek audience and caused a lot of debate on how moral is for such programmes to be televised. As a matter of fact, political rivals of Eugenia's husband, Adonis Georgiades, took advantage of her media inexperience aiming at her and Adonis' ethics. Consequently, the National Radio & Television Broadcasting Council after the end of 1st season, disallowed the show to carry on for a 2nd one. There is a major percentage of civilians criticizing her personality since then. In first semester of 2010 Eugenia came back participating in 2 shows. She was the female judge of Ellada Eheis Talento (season 3) (Greece Got Talent) along with male judges Ilias Psinakis and Vangelis Perris. The host of the show was Hristos Ferentinos. Her different point of view on what is considered to be a talent, resulted in numerous arguments between the judges and heavy criticism from TV critics. In the end, it proved to be the most successful season of the show. At the same time, Eugenia competed in the 1st season of Dancing with the Stars (Greek TV series) with pro-partner Elias Ladas. The intriguing part there was that she had to compete with Matthildi Maggira who replaced in Greece Got Talent. She performed remarkably well, gaining audience's interest. Eugenia and Elias eventually got eliminated in the semi-final (3rd place). There were rumors that she was denied final spot because she had already signed for her next step with rival TV channel Mega Channel. After 5 seasons of Dancing With The Stars in Greece, Eugenia is still considered to be in top-5 overall contestants, with several guest appearances in the show. So, in second semester of 2010, Eugenia Manolidou presented the 1st season of cooking show MasterChef Greece broadcast from Mega Channel, an adaptation of the original MasterChef (UK TV series) BBC show. The 3 judges were chefs Lefteris Lazarou, Giannis Loukakos and Dimitris Skarmoutsos. Although many predicted failure, MasterChef proved to be the most successful cooking show ever in Greek TV. Anticipation for next episode grew larger and larger and the Big Final on December 28, 2010 has been an audience's measurement milestone. \\"\\"Master Chef\\"\\" was declared contestant Akis Petretzikis and he remains unique since 2nd season of MasterChef Greece never ended. Eugenia's spontaneous reaction on winner announcement was never cut on editing and thus an urban slogan emerged: ŒòŒ± Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÅœÅŒµœçœÉœâ i.e. I am about to collapse. She opted not to present either Junior version or 2nd season despite proposals for both. In 2011, Eugenia returned to \\"\\"ANT1\\" for the 4th season of Greece Got Talent, but due to financial reasons, the show was postponed for the next year. Meanwhile, she accepted to present Dancing With the Stars Daily, a programme based upon Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two from BBC that followed action of 2nd season of Dancing with the Stars (Greek TV series). DWTS Daily eventually embedded in morning infotainment programme of ANT1. In 2012, Ellada Eheis Talento (season 4) was finally aired and Eugenia kept her position as the female judge. Unlike her, Ilias Psinakis could not return and Haris Hristopoulos took his place. There were not any arguments except some nasty contestants and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It was the final edition of the show till now as well as Eugenia's most recent job on TV.

The site is at the corner of the Manpad, and Herenweg, on property belonging to the estate 'Huis te Manpad'. Inscription Inscription on monument 'De Naald', Heemstede History De Naald is the name the locals have given the monument. The 'needle' has often been mistaken for the border mark between Heemstede and Bennebroek, but in fact the border is further south. :nl:David Jacob van Lennep (classicus), who lived in the 'Huis te Manpad' behind the monument, was a Dutch poet and professor of classical languages in Amsterdam. His son, Jacob van Lennep, who was 15 at the time of the monument's placement, later wrote a song commemorating 'Witte van Haemstede', one of the heroes mentioned on the monument. Later historians have questioned whether these events did in fact take place, and also whether the location is correct.F.W.N.Hugenholz, Historie en historiografie van de slag aan het Manpad (1304) Historical essay from 1954 published in Jaarboek van de Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde, 1954-1955, now in the DBNL The Manpad was a generic name for the North-South route along the Dune ridge running from the Hague to Alkmaar. In most towns the road took on the name of Hoofdweg, the equivalent of 'Main Street'. This particular stretch of Manpad actually runs East-West, crossing the Leidsevaart from one sand ridge to another. The battles, if they took place, could have taken place anywhere along the Manpad. It is unlikely that Witte van Haemstede would reach Haarlem via the Manpad from Zandvoort, as the legend has it. The most direct route to Haarlem from Zandvoort is via the Visserspad. Location Red X shows site 'De Naald' on old map of Heemstede On this 1687 map, the Manpad is the main east-west route connecting Vogelenzang to Heemstede. This little map is a detail of a larger map showing the entire route of the Leidsevaart from Leiden to Haarlem (this is the black vertical double line in the middle). This piece of the old Manpad is the only piece with that name on the map. To the right of the Herenweg the Manpad continues east through what is now Groenendaal park towards the old center of Heemstede and the Haarlem lake (Haarlemmermeer). This footpath in the park still exists, though the east side of the park has changed quite a bit since the Haarlemmermeer was pumped dry in 1853.

A Hill-Eubanks Production, the show was hosted by co-creator Bob Eubanks and announced first by Charlie O'Donnell, but due to conflicts with his announcing duties on Wheel of Fortune, he was later replaced by Tony McClay. For one week of shows during April 1979, the announcer was Bill Baldwin. Game play Three contestants were told some interesting secrets about a panel of five stars. The secrets were given to the producers beforehand in an interview, and the contestants' job was to match the secret to the celebrity that gave that secret.Television Game Show Hosts: Biographies of 32 Stars By David Baber, page 91 On each secret, a randomizer shuffled money amounts ranging from $120 ‚Äì $300, stopping when a player pressed a button. After the secret was read, one celebrity whom the secret did not pertain to (just for fun) offered his/her opinion on which star had the secret. The contestants then secretly chose which star had the secret, and a correct answer won money according to how many contestants got it right: if two or all three players were correct, they split the money (1/3 for all three, and 1/2 for two), but if only one player got it, he/she got the whole pot. Money values doubled for the third and fourth secrets. In the final round, all three players would attempt to identify one final secret, called the \\"Blind Item\\", which was worth $1,500. In the final round, no stars were able to guess who they thought was the person who had the secret. The player with the most money at the end of the game was the winner and received a bonus prize, while the other two contestants got to keep whatever money they earned, with a guaranteed $100 minimum, and also received parting gifts. A sudden death secret was played if two or three players were tied. In the final segment, and during the end credits, Eubanks would sometimes bring in someone that was related to a secret one of the celebrities had or bring in an item mentioned by a celebrity during the game. Notable celebrities A number of people who rarely made television game show appearances participated in the show, including Wilt Chamberlain and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Pilots The show was originally going to be called Celebrity Secrets, but was changed at the last minute; had its planned 1989 revival made it to air (see below), it would have used said title. A syndicated revival was planned for the 1989-1990 season (as part of a game show block that included Jackpot!, Talk About, and The Last Word), but was scrapped after the show's distributor ran into financial problems. Episode status The episode status is unknown. Eight episodes are known to exist, including the August 1978 pilot episode, as well as a Studio Master, among private collectors. GSN aired the June 5, 1979, episode on Sunday, October 5, 2014, as part of their Time Capsule and aired the same episode on Thursday, October 9, 2014, as part of Throwback Thursday. Foreign adaptations A version of All Star Secrets was produced by LWT for the United Kingdom as part of a one-off Bruce Forsyth's Big Night special that aired in April 1980 on ITV. The celebrity panel consisted of Joan Collins, Reginald Bosanquet, Carol Channing, Jimmy Tarbuck, and Susan George. The series returned to British television as a regular series four years later, in 1985. Hosted by Michael Parkinson, it ran until 1986.

The name dates back to the 1960s, while the princess cut as it exists was created by Betazel Ambar and Israel Itzkowitz in 1980. The cut has a square or rectangular shape when viewed from above, and from the side is similar to that of an inverted pyramid with four beveled sides. Its popularity was at its highest in the 80s and 90s, though its popularity was high in the 2000s as well. It is the second most popular diamond cut, below round and above cushion. Characteristics The face-up shape of the princess cut (technical name 'square modified brilliant' is square or rectangular and the profile or side-on shape is similar to that of an inverted pyramid with four beveled sides. The design is sometimes considered feminine. When looked down on, it bares an X shape. They are slightly less expensive and less cut than round diamonds. The sharp points of the diamond make it more prone to damage. The number of chevrons can affect the overall outlook of a princess cut diamond. This can usually be determined by the wire diagram that is plotted in diamond grading reports. The princess cut had its origins in the early \\"French\\" cut. History The name 'princess cut' was applied in the 1960s to a cut created by Arpad Nagy called the profile cut. Following this, more square cuts were given the name. These include the barion cut and the quadrillion cut, which were precursors to the current princess cut. It is one of the newest diamond shapes. Popularity As of 2015, princess cut diamonds were the second most popular choice for an engagement ring. Approximately 30% of engagement rings use princess cut diamonds, behind round diamonds (50%) and ahead of cushions (8%). It saw its popularity at its peak in the 80s and 90s. The princess cut experienced a rise in popularity from the early 2000s to the mid 2000s. In the 2000s, the most popular engagement ring featured a princess cut diamond surrounded by round brilliant-cut diamonds. Disney in conjunction with Zales created a series of Disney Princess rings, with some of them, such as Aurora's, Fa Mulan's, Snow White's, and Tinker Bell's featuring princess cuts. Princess cut diamonds have been used in different sports awards. The Chicago Cubs' trophy for their 2016 World Series win featured, among others, two princess cut diamonds.

Cooking methods The dish is made with dried giant white beans (fasolia gigandes), tomatoes, onions, olive oil, parsley, and sugar. When fasolia gigandes cannot be obtained, large lima beans are suitable substitutes. Other vegetables such as garlic, carrots, and celery are sometimes used, and some rustic recipes add sausages or cubed smoked pork. The beans are first soaked (often overnight), then boiled until tender and drained, and the rest of ingredients are added. The aromatics are saut√©ed to make a sofrito and mixed with the beans.

It was the first high-density suburb (township), being established in 1907. At that time, it was located near the city cemetery, sewage works, and abattoir. It was originally called Harare (pronounced Ha- rah-reh) Township, a name later on used for the capital city itself. Harare is a corruption of Havarari, meaning 'They never sleep' and this was the name given to the Zezuru Chief of this northeastern part of Zimbabwe, a Chief Harava. History Mbare (formerly Harare) started to expand in about 1907 when the white settlers built a town called Salisbury, and thus created an influx of people coming from Mozambique, Zambia, and Malawi looking for employment. The phenomenon gave rise to urban development, but real growth was accelerated when Mbare moved from where Cold Storage Commission is today to its present location. The first council houses built were popularly known as Kaytor (\\"Old bricks\\"). The colonial term for these kinds of suburbs was the locations, very similar to housing projects in the USA. The area was largely populated by migrant workers while the local workforce preferred to maintain their rural homes (reserved places) and came to the city seasonally. During the 1940s there was a big shortage of workers as described in D. Sean Bott's Labour in colonial Zimbabwe. The council built Matapi flats and hostels to accommodate local male workers. They would work for a few days at a time and then return to their families in the rural areas. Today those flats are occupied by married couples. Significant portions of Mbare were destroyed by police and military forces during Operation Murambatsvina in May 2005. Economy and markets Venders at Mbare Musika Vegetables for sale at Mbare Musika Mbare has Mbare Musika, the largest farm produce market in Zimbabwe. Farmers deliver their fresh crops every morning and some travel from far away places like Mutare, Masvingo and Kariba to sell their produce. This area has fallen into disrepair in recent years. There are other market places in Mbare, including Mupedza Nhamo (a Shona word loosely translated as \\"The finisher of quandaries\\"). This is a market for cheap clothing, with shirts available for as little as $1 U.S, or second-hand shoes for $5 US. This market is frequented by people from Mbare and the surrounding area but has become a popular shopping location for middle class hipsters. Another market is Magaba (loosely translated to mean \\"tins\\"), a market place for metal goods and other craftsmanship. This is a hub for budding entrepreneurs and artists, making products such as cooking pots, cups, bathing basins and carpentry work such as tables, beds, chairs, display cabinets and coffins. These provide a livelihood for a substantial portion of the population of Mbare. Mbare's most famous attraction is the Curio Market, the largest market for traditional artwork, including soapstone sculpture and Mbira instruments. The town also has large food and vegetable markets. Through the central bus station Mbare Musika is linked to all major roads, and is the Hub linking buses to all different destinations in Zimbabwe and neighbouring countries. Trade and transport are the pillars of economy in Mbare. Facilities=Education Mbare has six government primary schools: Chirodzo, Gwinyai, Chitsere, Shingirai and Nharira. There are three faith schools: St Peter's Roman Catholic School, Chiedza, a Salvation Army church school, and Anglican-run St. Michaels Primary School. The four secondary schools in Mbare are Harare High School, George Stark, St Peters High School and Mbare High School. Hospitals Hospitals in the area include Edith Oppermann Maternity Wing and Clinic, Mbare Flats Clinic, Matapi clinic and Beatrice Road Infectious Disease hospital. Other prominent buildings Mbare's features include Rufaro stadium, which hosted the sixth African Games. Dynamos F.C. (also known to its fans as \\"Dembare\\"), one of the country's top soccer teams, has its home ground at Rufaro Stadium, and it is also an international football ground capable of hosting topflight matches. For Independence Day in 1980 Bob Marley was personally invited by Edgar Tekere, and played a concert in Rufaro Stadium. Harare Cemetery is noted for its World War graves. Harare Magistrate Courts is situated in Mbare, a civil and criminal court without powers to prosecute serious cases. Culture In the Old bricks era jazz, tap dancing and concerts were popular in the town, and well-known singers Thomas Mapfumo, Hilton Mambo and Elisha Josam all came from Mbare. With later generations, the music known as zimdancehall became popular, and fans in Mbare developed a sound of shona music requiring instrumental tunes and play clacks as the dance. Prominent artists involved in the Mbare scene include Soul Jah Love, Killer T, Sir Calaz, and Kinner. Mbare has a public swimming pool called George Hartley, where live bands perform during the summer. Other notable cultural locations in Mbare include the Mai Musodzi Hall, one of Harare's oldest theatres, named after Mai Musodzi, pioneer of education for women in Zimbabwe. The Mai Musodzi Hall is next to the Mbare Musika, and young adults go there to watch late 1990s action movies. Stodart Hall, Mbare's biggest community centre, hosted Sir Cliff Richard during his tour in the 1960s, and nowadays the recently- upgraded hall hosts DJ parties and club nights. The hall is also used for film screenings and as a place of last vigil for deceased national heroes. A football field popularly known as Number 7 was extended with new gym facilities in the early 1990s, an open roof netball court and three outside basketball courts. Media Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation formerly Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation had the first black newsreaders, and was the only media that could broadcast in the local vernacular languages chiShona and Ndebele. In 1956, Mrs Mlambo started a children's show called Mbuya Chirambakusakara.

Cap. (; November 5, 1715 ‚Äì May 31, 1787) was a Capuchin friar, and is honored as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. Life He was born Filippo Giacomo Amoroso in Nicosia, Sicily on 5 November 1715,Capuchin Franciscan friars of Australia \\"Capuchin Franciscan Saints\\" about three weeks after the death of his father on October 12. As a young boy Filippo helped in the workshop of a shoemaker near a Capuchin friary. Thus from an early age, he got to know the friars and to admire their way of life.\\"Felix of Nicosia (1715-1787)\\", Vatican News Service At the age of 20 he asked the Guardian of the friary to speak for him to the Minister Provincial in Messina so that he could be admitted to the Order as a lay brother. Being illiterate, he could not be admitted as a cleric. His application was rejected several times; however, seeing his continued perseverance, after eight years he was admitted to the Order and sent to the novitiate in Mistretta. On October 19, 1743 he entered the novitiate, being given the name of Brother Felix (after the first Capuchin saint), and professed his vows a year later. Against the norms, the authorities of the Province then assigned him to the friary in his hometown. This was contrary to the norms, because the fear was that young friars would find themselves distracted by family and friends, thereby stunting their spiritual growth. Yet the level of his detachment was so great that they felt that this fear was largely unwarranted in his case. He was given the job of quaestor, which involved roaming the region in the goal of collecting alms to support the friars and their work.\\"St. Felix of Nicosia, OFM Cap.\\", Capuchin Franciscans Western America Province Every day he would knock on doors, inviting people to share their prosperity. His nature was such that he would always say 'thank you' and even when he was manhandled he would exclaim: Let it be for the love of God. He was devoted to Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. On Fridays he would contemplate the Passion and death of Jesus Christ. On Fridays during Lent, he fasted on bread and water. He had a particular veneration for the Blessed Sacrament, spending hours in front of the tabernacle, even after having endured the harsh trials of every day. He was endowed with the gift of healing both physical and spiritual diseases and he delighted in tending the sick. He could also bilocate in the same way as another Capuchin friar of modern times, Padre Pio. Called to aid the sick when a malignant epidemic was decimating the nearby town of Cerami in March 1777, he responded eagerly. He went about ministering the sick, and his efforts were crowned with great success. For 33 years he lived under a Guardian who considered it his role to sanctify Felix by subjecting him to relentless severity and fantastic humiliations, all of which he heroically endured. Finally, in May 1787 he was overtaken by a sudden, raging fever while working in the garden. Brother Felix told the doctor, who prescribed medicines for him that proved useless, because this was his final illness. He died later that month, on May 31, at two in the morning. So dedicated was he to his vow of obedience that he requested permission to die from the Guardian of the community. Veneration Brother Felix was beatified by Pope Leo XIII on 12 February 1888. In 1891, his relics were translated to the cathedral of the city for greater access by the public who wished to venerate him. He was canonized on 23 October 2005 by Pope Benedict XVI.

The goal of the organization is to provide a standard measurement of what constitutes a sustainable product and use it to assure retailers and consumers that they are pucharsing sustainably grown items. Protected Harvest was founded in 2001 as an independent non-profit organization and merged into SureHarvest in 2008. According to EcoLabeling.org, a non-profit monitoring certification programs, \\"Protected Harvest is an eco-label with the stated mission of helping farmers meet environmental standards that yield high quality products and preserve healthy land for future generations.\\" Pest-management in particular is among the specialties of Protected Harvest, according to Consumer Reports. Activities The Protected Harvest program provides technical support and collaborates with qualified organizations to develop region and crop‚Äìspecific verifiable environmental performance standards, which are peer reviewed before being presented to its Oversight Board for adoption. The public availability of the standards and methodology is part of the Protected Harvest commitment to transparency. Upon certification through on-site verification, growers may use the Protected Harvest eco-label in marketing their certified foods. The first Protected Harvest certified crop to hit the shelves was Healthy Grown potatoes from Wisconsin. Additionally, Protected Harvest certifies winegrapes from the Lodi Rules for Sustainable Winegrowing program of the Lodi Woodbridge Winegrape Commission in Lodi, California, fresh and fresh-cut mushrooms from the Modern Mushroom company, and stonefruit sold under the Zeal and Ripe 'N Ready brands. Board of Directors According to the Protected Harvest web- site: > The Protected Harvest Board of directors is a collaboration of > representatives of prominent environmental organizations, agricultural > specialists, scientists, and marketing experts. The Board‚Äôs responsibility > is to review and approve all standards as grounded in environmental science > and practical for on-farm implementation. Currently the Protected Harvest oversight board, charged with the task of developing the measurements for what constitutes sustainably grown product consists of the following: *Suzy Friedman, Center for Conservation Incentives, Environmental Defense Fund *Will Horwath, PhD (Council President), Professor, Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis *Jonathan Kaplan, Director, Agriculture Project, Natural Resources Defense Council *Deana Knutson, PhD, Biointensive IPM Coordinator, WWF/WPVGA/UW Collaboration *Charles Mellinger, PhD, Technical Director, Glades Crop Care, Inc. *Cliff Ohmart, PhD, Vice President of Professional Services, SureHarvest *Kai Robertson, Independent Sustainability Expert *Ann Sorenson, Assistant Vice President of Research, American Farmland Trust Advantages The certification approach is said by Protected Harvest literature to have great environmental value in that it helps to solve a major intractable problem: nonpoint source pollution caused by agricultural runoff of pesticides and fertilizer components such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Certain pesticides and fertilizers provide cheap insurance to farmers that they will have large yields. Third-party certification is designed to provide assurance to consumers that growers are in fact utilizing practices which reduce these problems. Each Protected Harvest production standard is written to reflect the unique growing requirements and environmental considerations of the crop and the specific bioregion in which it is grown. A ‚Äútypical‚Äù standard is divided into four major sections: whole farm management, soil and water management, and air quality management. Depending on the crop, the region where it is grown, and the exact production system being addressed, the relative importance of the factors will change. When developing a standard for certification purposes, the point system is ultimately determined by a multidisciplinary Crop Advisory Committee that is assembled for the writing of each crop certification standard. A peer review of the standard is then conducted to evaluate the technical competency of the standard, followed by a review by the Protected Harvest Oversight Board.

Early years The Carl Street Studios complex began its life as a single family three story mansion built during the 1880s, and was, during part of these early years, reputedly owned by a mayor of the city of Chicago. During the 1880s through the 1910s, the surrounding neighborhood was a fashionable district for Chicago's upper middle class. The original structure, located on what was then Carl Street, was quite typical of the Victorian mansions that were built during the period, and its style is fairly reflected by many of the brownstone and greystone mansions that still dot the west side of LaSalle Street between Division Street and North Avenue. During the 1910s and 1920s the socio-economic status of the surrounding area changed, with German, Bohemian and eastern European immigrants constituting the primary ethnic makeup of the new resident pool. Many of the Victorian mansions in the area, including those located on Carl Street, were converted into multi-family dwellings and some fell into disrepair. The value of real estate in the neighborhood suffered a corresponding decline. Sol Kogen & Edgar Miller Shortly after World War I, a clique of enterprising and innovative artists enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Two such art students, Sol Kogen and Edgar Miller, met at the school and became friends and leaders of an avant-garde group of art students. Sol Kogen's parents were reasonably prosperous merchants from Chicago. A bon vivant throughout his lifetime, Sol entered the family business shortly after his experience at the Art Institute, and did well enough to \\"retire\\" from the business in the mid-1920s, travel to Europe for a number of years and pursue more independent and artistic endeavors. In about 1927, Sol Kogen, having spent some years in Paris, and in particular the artistic Montmartre neighborhood of that city, conceived of a plan to develop an artist studio in Chicago where independent-leaning Midwestern artists could work. Sol Kogen sought an environment in which modern art could be encouraged and flourish in Chicago. To assist him in this enterprise, Kogen called upon his former fellow student and friend, Edgar Miller, whose earliest work at the School of the Art Institute showed a clear inclination toward modernism, and who won the Institute's prestigious Logan medal for his innovative work on a stained glass panel that is still displayed in the Art Institute's permanent collection. While little known today, Edgar Miller was one of the most well-known Chicago artists of his time and contributed mightily to the Chicago community's modern art movement of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Initially, Miller opened a small art gallery on Pearson Street, quaintly referred to as the \\"House at the End of the Street,\\" where he exhibited his own diverse opus of work, as well as the work of other modern artists, including Lionel Feininger, Rudolph Weisenborn, John Storrs, and John W. Norton. Edgar Miller's artistic venue was as diverse as any artists' in the world. He excelled at oil painting, watercolor, pastels, mural painting, plaster relief, sculpture, iron, steel and copper work, ceramics, textiles, mosaics, printmaking, wood carving, and stained glass. During his most productive period, Edgar was contracted to create extensive murals for the Tavern and Standard Clubs in Chicago, stained glass, sculpture and relief work for many commercial, government, educational and religious buildings throughout the Chicago area, New York and in other cities, and design work for restaurants and individual residences. Purchasing the mansion and renovation A Plaque about Carl Street On the Studio itself In 1927, Kogen purchased the mansion at 155 West Carl Street, which stood on two city lots, and asked Miller to help convert the structure into an aesthetically enticing, modern studio complex for emerging artists. From the outset, the central idea behind Carl Street Studios was to create a series of unique art studio apartments that would open out to closed communal exterior spaces fraught with gardens, fountains, koi fish ponds and, of course, art. A somewhat similar concept had already been established at the Tree Studios, located further south on State Street, earlier in the 20th century. However, unlike the Tree Studios complex, Kogen and Miller conceived of a studio complex whose interior and exterior spaces would themselves be innovative works of art, and not merely functional spaces for the production of art. To help build the complex, Kogen and Miller recruited some of their former colleagues from the Art Institute and other like-minded emerging Chicago artists, including John W. Norton, Edgar Britton, Edward Millman, Stewart Rae and a highly talented and versatile Mexican immigrant, Jesus Torres. In exchange for their respective contributions, these artists would be permitted to reside free-of-charge in the studios as work progressed. Work began in 1927, when the crew of artists gutted the three-story mansion, including the basement. Edgar Miller is credited with creating the interior space plan for all of the studio units in the former mansion, which included using basement spaces as primary living areas, a novel concept at the time, and featuring duplex architectural configurations, which provided for lofted bedroom and art studio spaces above. While functional, kitchens and bathrooms were not a priority. The exterior walls of the mansion were masked with a new face of common brick and featured artistic textural elements and designs. Miller and his fellow artists met the challenge of maximizing light in each studio while maintaining privacy. In some units, soaring windows of stained, painted and/or obscure glass, painstakingly rendered by Miller, were installed. The building also pioneered the extensive use of block and molded, textured glass for primary living space windows. Interior walls (composed mainly of plaster), fireplaces and floors were aesthetically enhanced with painted murals, plaster reliefs, and hand- carved patterned wood elements. One of the most distinctive features of the apartments is the extensive and highly innovative use of a myriad of colored marbles, terrazzo, and Rookwood, Teco, Grueby and Batchelder tiles on all manner of surfaces. Decorative copper, iron and steel work abound, and creative lighting (for the time) added allure and intrigue to the studios. The exterior door of each unit enjoys its own distinctive personality (many with intricate hand carved elements by Edgar Miller and Jesus Torres), and contributes to the asymmetrical flavor of the building. Much of the high-grade materials used in the building were reclaimed by the artists from demolished mansions in the area, demolished buildings from the 1933-34 Century of Progress International Exposition (in which many of the artists contributed), and, later during the depression, the Maxwell Street market vendors. After work on the studios in the mansion was completed, the artists erected additional four-story buildings lining the periphery of the property that essentially created the enveloped east courtyard that you see today. Artistic flourishes, such as interesting brick and tile work, mosaics, plaster and ceramic reliefs and wood carvings, mainly by Edgar Miller and Jesus Torres, enhanced the aesthetic impression of these newer structures, which contained additional artist studios with equally fanciful and dramatic interior spaces. Committed to the artistic gestalt of the complex, Miller and his crew of artists at an early date replaced the sidewalk in front of the building with a dramatic walkway of colorful and diverse tiles and marbles which informs the visitor or casual passerby that Carl Street Studios is a unique phenomenon to Chicago, and also gives a glimpse of what mysteries lie behind the front wall of the complex. The Depression As a result of the stock market crash of 1929, Sol Kogen's financial position was severely impacted. Consequently, during the depression, Kogen relied more and more on Carl Street Studios as a means of revenue. The \\"art for art sake\\" spirit of the complex diminished somewhat, and Kogen apparently began demanding that the studio spaces be made smaller in order to increase the number of paying tenants. A rift thus developed between the art-inspired Miller and the cashed strapped Kogen and by 1936, Miller ceased work on the project altogether. It must also be said that, by this time, Miller's work was in high demand commercially, and it is unlikely that he was contributing much to the complex anyway. With Edgar Miller's departure, most of the ongoing art work in the studio complex was completed by the versatile Jesus Torres, who had been Miller's primary apprentice. During the ensuing decades, generations of artisans and craftsmen (and craftswomen) have worked on the exteriors and interiors of the studio complex. The 1950s In the late 1950s Sol Kogen died, and the apartment complex was run first by Sol's wife and upon her death, Sol's daughter. In 1985, Sol's daughter sold the building to a Chicago entrepreneur, who located Edgar Miller in California and invited the artist back to the complex to continue work. Miller relished the opportunity to leave retirement and complete the project he planned almost sixty years before. From this time until the early 1990s, Edgar Miller lived in the complex and executed stained glass work, murals, and other art pieces for the building. Many of the studios were further enhanced by these later works by Miller, who eventually died in Chicago in 1993 at the age of 94. A view into the courtyard through The Gate Portal Gardens have always been an important and integral element at Carl Street Studios. From the beginning of the art studio project, peripheral flower and tree beds were formed in the east and west courtyards of the structure. Both courtyards also feature ponds where many generations of koi and goldfish have led charmed lives, while delighting residents and visitors alike. In fact, Carl Street Studios and their gardens have always been a place of revelry for residents and their guests. During the early years, the artist residents and folks from the surrounding neighborhood would gather in the east courtyard for goat roasts and annual New Years parties. The midlevel and roof gardens have also existed from an early date and have provided residents with a forum for warm summer evening get-togethers and dinners. Carl Street Studios has traditionally welcomed the public to enjoy its magical spaces, artwork and gardens during the annual Dearborn Garden Walk. From the outset, Carl Street Studios served as the guiding spirit and anchor of the Old Town community as an artistic enclave in Chicago. Shortly after work began on the building, other artistically inclined individuals and groups, often with the assistance of Kogen, Miller and their band of artists, began remodeling other buildings on Carl Street (which was renamed Burton Place during the mid-1930s) to render an amorphous and ad hoc modern character to the street. This led still others to build or remodel buildings in a similar vein on other streets in the neighborhood, including Schiller and Wells streets. In addition to the artists already identified that have resided at Carl Street Studios, others include the world-famous artists Boris Anisfeld and Mark Tobey, and television pioneer entertainer David Garroway. Hollywood starlets, such as Tallulah Bankhead, and more recently Virginia Madsen, were also residents or frequent guests. During the early years, Sol Kogen and Edgar Miller presented public art exhibitions within the complex, displaying the works of some of Chicago's better known modern and avant-garde artists. Since 1930, Carl Street Studios has been the subject of numerous newspaper and magazine articles, scholarly publications and public lectures. Its eclectic design and whimsical spaces have never become stale and they continue to ensure to residents and visitors alike a surprise around every corner.

After that he was elected member of the parliament, and shorty Prime Minister from 16 October 1921 to 5 December 1921. From 1922 to 1924 he was Foreign Minister. During Fan Noli's tenure after the June Revolution he exiled in Romania, returning in 1925 when he was elected Head of the Senate. As a representative of Kor√ßa, he headed the session which proclaimed Albania as a Constitutional Monarchy and Ahmet Zogu as King of Albania. A strong supporter of Zog, he directed three cabinets as Prime Minister from 1930 to 1935. He was replaced by Mehdi Frash√´ri after the critics received for \\"failing to maintain peace and order\\" during the Revolt of Fier, 1935. He served as Parliamentary President until the Italian invasion of 1939. Although he was considered a pro-Italian, and his name appears in the Assembly list of 1943, he did not play any active role during World War II. The communist regime did not persecute him.

It was one of the most influential books in post-war British Labour Party thinking. It was the seminal work of the 'revisionist' school of Labour politics.Crosland sought to revise the Labour Party's constitutional commitment to the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, (Aims, Clause four, party four): \\"If Socialism is defined as the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, we produce solutions which deny almost all the values that socialists have normally read into the word.‚Äù Quoted by Hattersley in Hattersley, Roy, To imagine Labour's future, rewind 50 years, The Times online, September 15, 2006, accessed 27 June 2007 The book defined Labour's perspective on the post-war consensus, by which the major parties largely agreed on issues of the welfare state and economic policy from 1945 to the late 1970s.Dutton, David. British Politics Since 1945: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of Consensus (2nd ed. Blackwell, 1997). excerpt for political history seen from the Post-War Consensus viewpoint. Crosland, an Oxford University academic before entering Parliament, had lost his seat in the 1955 general election, and so was able to finish the book he had been working on for several years, seeking to offer a new argument for social democracy in the context of the new political and economic consensus introduced by the 1945‚Äì1951 Clement Attlee governments. However, The Future of Socialism has continued to be a reference point for intellectual debates within the Labour Party and the centre-left in succeeding generations, including the SDP-Labour split in 1981, the modernisation of Labour under Neil Kinnock and the rise of New Labour. The book's 50th anniversary in 2006 sparked a new debate with leading Labour figures including Gordon Brown, Jack Straw,Jack Straw, Socialism: the new divide, New Statesman, 18 September 2006, accessed 27 June 2007 Ed Miliband,, Google cached page accessed 27 June 2007 Roy HattersleyHattersley, Roy, To imagine Labour's future, rewind 50 years, The Times online, September 15, 2006, accessed 27 June 2007 and others setting out views of its relevance to the next generation of 'post-New Labour' politics. The Fabian Society, which co-published the 2006 edition, set out the argument about 'renewal' of Labour's thinking after a decade in power requires a further generation of 'revisionist' thinking which seeks to emulate Crosland's contribution in the 1950s. Overview A central argument in the book is Crosland's distinction between 'means' and 'ends'. Crosland demonstrates the variety of socialist thought over time, and argues that a definition of socialism founded on nationalisation and public ownership is mistaken, since these are simply one possible means to an end. For Crosland, the defining goal of the left should be more social equality. As a result, Crosland argued: Crosland also argued that an attack on unjustified inequalities would give any left party a political project to make the definition of the end point of 'how much equality' a secondary and more academic question. Crosland also developed his argument about the nature of capitalism (developing the argument in his contribution 'The Transition from Capitalism' in the 1952 New Fabian Essays volume). Asking, \\"is this still capitalism?\\", Crosland argued that post-war capitalism had fundamentally changed, meaning that the Marxist claim that it was not possible to pursue equality in a capitalist economy was no longer true. Crosland wrote as follows: Crosland argued that these features of a reformed managerial capitalism were irreversible. Others, including those within the Labour Party, would later argue that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan brought about its reversal.Eatwell, Roger; Wright, Anthony (1999). Contemporary Political Ideologies (2nd ed.). London: Continuum. p. 93. . A third important argument was Crosland's liberal vision of the 'good society'. Here his target was the dominance in Labour and Fabian thinking of Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb, and a rather grey, top down bureaucratic vision of the socialist project. Following R. H. Tawney, Crosland stressed that equality would not mean uniformity:  Labour revisionism  Labour revisionism turned out to be a powerful ideological tendency within the Party in the 1950s and 1960s, taking intellectual sustenance from the Crosland book, and political leadership from Hugh Gaitskell. Other important intellectuals included Douglas Jay, Roy Jenkins, and the writers who contributed to Socialist Commentary. The goal was to reformulate old socialist principles, and bring the Labour Party policies up to date with the changing British society and economy. Revisionism rejected the old view that socialism ought to be primarily identified with the ownership of the means of production. That meant that continuous nationalization was not a central goal. Second, was a series of political values focused on personal liberty, social welfare, and equality. Themes of destroying or overthrowing the rich and elite were downplayed in favor of policies of high taxation, more widespread educational opportunity, and expanded social services. Revisionists insisted on the necessity of a market- oriented mixed economy with a central role for capitalism and entrepreneurship.Stephen Haseler, The Gaitskellites: Revisionism in the British Labour Party 1951‚Äì64 (Springer, 1969).F.M. Leventhal, Twentieth- century Britain: an encyclopedia (Peter Lang, 2002) pp 435-6.  Reaction and reputation  The book was highly controversial at the time of its publication, given the heated dispute between the Gaitskellite and the Bevanite wings over the future direction of the Labour Party. A review of Crosland's book in the left-wing Tribune newspaper became famous for its headline \\"How dare he call himself a socialist\\".The New Statesman in 1959 compared those who wished to take his view of socialism out of the Labour Party with Christians wanting to drop Christ. It began: \\"The title of my sermon 'Should We Drop Christ?'\\". Cited by Miliband, , Google cached page accessed 27 June 2007 The book was however largely positively received in the media and right-wing circles of the Labour Party. Labour thinkers and academics have continued to debate the relevance of Crosland's thinking to more recent political debates within the party. A significant criticism of Crosland in the 1960s and 1970s made is that he had been too sanguine about the prospects for economic growth and so was concerned more about the distribution of wealth than its creation. He had written in The Future of Socialism as follows. Crosland himself acknowledged in The Conservative Enemy (1962) the validity of the criticism of this view, and in this and his later writings and speeches he addressed the question of growth more centrally.  Crosland, New Labour and after  There are different views on the influence of Crosland on the creation of New Labour. Some see New Labour as arising directly from the revisionist tradition set out in The Future of Socialism, and applying these ideas to the politics of the 1990s. In particular, Tony Blair's decision to rewrite Clause Four of the Labour constitution is seen as achieving a central revisionist goal.\\"he can justly claim to have been the original inspiration for the new Clause Four, which was Tony Blair's seminal achievement in the first few months of his leadership.\\" Jack Straw,Socialism: the new divide, New Statesman, 18 September 2006, accessed 27 June 2007 However, New Labour was not keen to promote this link to the party's intellectual tradition, given the marketing of the party as having broken with the past. In substantive terms, while New Labour can be regarded as broadly revisionist, it was ambivalent and reluctant to explicitly commit itself to 'equality' as a goal of Labour politics, although its policies were redistributionist and aimed to reduce child poverty in particular.Steven Fielding The Labour Party: Continuity and Change in the making of new labour, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, pp. 179-180, p.188 Politicians seen as representing the Crosland tradition, most notably former deputy leader Roy Hattersley, who were regarded as firmly on the right of Labour politics throughout their careers, have now tended to find themselves arguing from the left of New Labour.cf. op cit However, leading New Labour figures have also drawn on Crosland's work. Gordon Brown has demonstrated a particular interest in Crosland and his legacy, giving a 1997 Crosland memorial lecture to the Fabian Society, (which was later published in the 1999 book Crosland and New Labour, edited by Dick Leonard), and writing the foreword for the 2006 50th anniversary edition of the book. Recent Labour Education Secretaries, including Ruth Kelly and Alan Johnson, have also drawn on Crosland's thinking in speeches and articles. Despite its reputation and the frequency with which it is invoked in contemporary Labour debate, the book was out of print for some time. To mark its 50th anniversary, the book was republished by Constable & Robinson in association with the Fabian Society in the autumn of 2006, with a foreword from Brown, an introduction from Leonard and an afterword from Susan Crosland.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 57. The community is in an arid, sparsely populated part of the state by road northeast of Lakeview. The valley surrounding Plush contains many marshes and shallow lakes, most of them intermittent. Frequented by Native Americans for many thousands of years, the valley became a region of sheep grazing and cattle ranching by the late 19th century. Plush's infrastructure includes a store, an elementary school, and a church. Nearby attractions include Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Warner Wetlands, and the Oregon Sunstone Public Collection Area. History People have lived in the Warner Valley for more than 10,000 years. Evidence of Native American occupation includes petroglyphs, hunting blinds, flakes from obsidian tools, and other material artifacts. By historic times, the Kid√ºt√∂kad√∂ band of Northern Paiute frequented the valley and the uplands of Hart Mountain, the fault block ridge to the east. The Euro-American settler community of Plush developed in the late 19th century around sheep grazing and small cattle ranches. Catholics from Ireland found work here as shepherds; their surnames and their churches are part of the regional heritage. The name \\"Plush\\" is said to have derived from a mispronunciation of the word \\"flush\\" during a 19th century poker game played in the community. The Plush post office was established in 1888, and David R. Jones was the first postmaster. Daniel Boone, a relative of the famous Kentucky pathfinder of the same name, became postmaster in 1898 and opened a general store in conjunction with the post office. Geography Plush School in 2015 By highway, Plush is about northeast of Lakeview and north of Adel in the Warner Valley of south-central Oregon.Google Maps Plush‚ÄìAdel Road runs north‚Äìsouth along the valley floor, while Plush Cutoff links Plush to Oregon Route 140 west of Adel. Hogback Road runs north from Plush, while Hart Mountain Road, which terminates in Plush, runs east and northeast to the Warner Wetlands Area of Critical Environmental Concern and the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge. Hart Lake, at the base of Hart Mountain, is about east of the community. Honey Creek flows generally east from near the south end of Abert Rim through Plush and into the lake. Plush is about above sea level, while Abert Rim reaches about and Hart Mountain . Plush is also near a large Oregon sunstone gemfield, which is partly on private land and partly on public land. The Oregon Sunstone Public Collection Area, overseen by the Bureau of Land Management, is about north of Plush. It allows amateur geologists (rockhounds) to remove sunstones‚Äîfeldspar crystals that formed in lava beds over the past 13 to 14 million years. Sunstone is the Oregon state gemstone.

The Vulcan Street Plant was housed in the Appleton Paper and Pulp Company building, which burned to the ground in 1891. A replica of the Vulcan Street Plant was later built on South Oneida Street. Origin The Vulcan Street Plant was conceptualized by H. J. Rogers ‚Äì who was the president of the Appleton Paper and Pulp Co. and of the Appleton Gas Light Co. during this time. According to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, H. J. Rogers first came up with the idea for a hydro-electric central station after talking with a friend of his, H. E. Jacobs, while they were on a fishing trip.NATIONAL HISTORIC ENGINEERING LANDMARK ‚Äì VULCAN STREET PLANT , Retrieved October 19, 2009. The Appleton Edison Electric Light Company H. E. Jacobs, who was working for Western Edison Light Company of Chicago as a licensing agent, informed H. J. Rogers about Thomas Edison‚Äôs plan for a steam-driven electric power plant in New York City called the Pearl Street Plant. Upon learning about Edison‚Äôs advances in electric light technology and electric generators, Rogers worked to bring together a group of investors in an effort to create one of the first hydro-electric central stations in the world. For this reason, the Appleton Edison Electric Light Company was formed and incorporated on May 25, 1882. While Edison‚Äôs Pearl Street Plant was still under construction, the founders of the Appleton Edison Electric Light Company ‚Äì H. E. Jacobs, A. L. Smith, H. D. Smith, and Charles Beveridge ‚Äì began planning the Vulcan Street Plant. In July 1882, an engineer named P. D. Johnston, who worked for Western Edison Light Company of Chicago during this time, visited Appleton to explain the details of Edison‚Äôs lighting system to the founders of the Appleton Edison Electric Light Company. After this meeting, the founders decided to test the viability of hydro-electric lighting by first installing it in their homes and mills. As a result, two Edison \\"K\\" type generators were ordered. The first generator was installed in H. J. Roger‚Äôs paper mill, the Appleton Paper and Pulp Company, and is the generator that began operation on September 30, 1882. The second generator was installed in its own building on Vulcan Street and began operation on November 25, 1882. Problems and successes On September 27, 1882, the first generator began operation, but without success. For this reason, the man who installed the generator, Edward T. Ames, returned to Appleton in an effort to correct the problem. After a few days of trial and error troubleshooting, the generator was fixed and successfully put it into operation on September 30, 1882. This was only 26 days after Thomas Edison began to successfully operate his steam-driven Pearl Street Plant in New York, which began operation on September 4, 1882. The output of the original generator was about 12.5 kilowatts. The first buildings to be lit by the Vulcan Street Plant were H.J. Rogers' home, the Appleton Paper and Pulp Company building, and the Vulcan Paper Mill, which were all connected directly to the generator. Initially, the buildings' direct connection to the generator caused many problems because the generator was directly connected to the waterwheel. The water from the Fox River did not flow at a constant rate, so the lights did not keep a constant brightness and often burnt out. This problem was resolved by moving the generator to a lean-to off the main building, where it was attached to a separate water wheel that allowed for a more even load distribution. During the time of the Vulcan Street Plant, voltage regulators did not yet exist. Operators had to look at the light itself to determine if it was at the proper brightness, and they adjusted the voltage according to their observations. Electricity meters did not exist at this time, so customers were charged a flat monthly fee based on the number of electric lamps installed in their building. For this reason, many people left their lights on all night. The original electric distribution lines in Appleton were made of bare copper. This posed many challenges in the early development of commercial electricity, because just about everything was made out of wood or other flammable materials. The wiring used in buildings was insulated by a thin layer of cotton and was fastened to walls using wood cleats. Likewise, wood was used for fuse boxes, light sockets, and switch handles. Appleton's first electrically lit buildings H. J. Rogers' home in Appleton, Wisconsin, now known as the Hearthstone Historic House Museum, one of the few surviving examples of the wiring and lighting fixtures from the dawn of the electrical age H. J. Rogers' home, which has been converted to be the Hearthstone Historic House Museum, is one of the few surviving examples of wiring and lighting fixtures from the dawn of the electrical age. The Vulcan Street Plant and the Appleton Paper and Pulp Company building burned to the ground in 1891, and the Vulcan Paper Mill was dismantled in 1908. After the Vulcan Street Plant was destroyed by fire, an exact replica was built on South Oneida Street and was opened to the public on September 30, 1932. According to the minutes taken at the Appleton Historic Preservation Committee meeting on October 21, 2008, the replica of the Vulcan Street Plant was, \\"... painstakingly constructed duplicating all of the building's original features.\\" This site was dedicated as an ASME National Historic Engineering Landmark, jointly designated with ASCE and IEEE on September 15, 1977.

Geophysical imaging (also known as geophysical tomography) is a minimally destructive geophysical technique that investigates the subsurface of a terrestrial planet. Geophysical imaging is a noninvasive imaging technique with a high parametrical and spatio-temporal resolution. Geophysical imaging has evolved over the last 30 years due to advances in computing power and speed. It can be used to model a surface or object understudy in 2D or 3D as well as monitor changes. There are many applications of geophysical imaging some of which include imaging the lithosphere and imaging glaciers. Many different techniques exist to perform geophysical imaging including seismic methods, electrical resistivity tomography, ground-penetrating radar, etc. Types of geophysical imaging: *Electrical resistivity tomography *Ground- penetrating radar *Induced polarization *Seismic tomography and Reflection seismology *Magnetotellurics  Applications = Imaging the Lithosphere  Some geophysical imaging techniques for the Earth's lithosphere and upper mantle include teleseismic tomography, surface-wave tomography, gravity modeling, and electromagnetic methods. Geophysical imaging techniques can be combined to create a more accurate image of the lithosphere. The techniques used to image the lithosphere can be used to map out the thermostructure of the Earth. In turn, the thermostructure reveals near surface processes such as seismicity, magma emplacement, and mineralization events. The ability to image the thermostructure could also reveal geophysical observables like gravity and information about tectonic plates like plate velocity and strain partitioning.  Alpine Rock Glaciers  Geophysical imaging techniques have been applied to alpine rock glaciers to better understand mountain permafrost and perform hazard-mitigation measures. The types of geophysical imaging used include: diffusive electromagnetic, geoelectric, seismic tomography, and ground- penetrating radar. In fact, the first use of ground-penetrating radar was to determine a glacier's depth in 1929. Two dimensional geophysical imaging techniques have recently allowed for 2D imaging of mountain permafrost.  Types of geophysical imaging = Seismic Methods  Seismic methods utilize elastic energy created by natural and artificial sources to create an image of the subsurface. Seismic waves are recorded on geophones. Seismic methods are split up into three different methods, reflection, refraction, and surface wave, based on the physical property of the waves being considered. The reflection method looks at reflected energy from sharp boundaries to determine contrasts in density and velocity. Reflections methods are mainly applied in the upper subsurface; however, strong lateral and vertical seismic velocity variations cause reflection methods to be difficult to implement in the upper 50 meters of the subsurface. The refraction method looks at refracted compressional, p-waves, or shear, s-waves, that bend through velocity gradients. Tracking differences in velocity of the p-waves and s-waves can be useful because s-wave's velocity react differently to fluid saturation and fracture geometry. Reflection and refraction seismic methods exploit the waves that can be produced by sledgehammer, explosives, weight drops, and vibrators to image the subsurface. The third seismic method, surface wave methods, look at the surface waves that seem to roll along the surface (ground roll).

He spent eight seasons in the North American Soccer League and was a member of the U.S. soccer team at the 1972 Summer Olympics. He also earned ten caps with the U.S. national team between 1973 and 1975. Ivanow attended the University of San Francisco where he played collegiate soccer under renowned coach Steve Negoesco. In 1968, he was an honorable mention as an All American. In 1967, Ivanow played both Olympic qualifying matches against Bermuda. The U.S. tied Bermuda in Bermuda on May 21. Six days later, it lost in Chicago when Ivanow and his team mates thought the referee had awarded Bermuda an indirect free kick only to discover their mistake as Gladwys Daniels easily scored. Ivanow made it to the Olympics five years later when he was a member of the U.S. team at the 1972 Munich games. He played the first two games, but Shep Messing replaced him in goal for the third game, against host West Germany. In 1973, Ivanow he earned his first cap with the senior national team when he came on for Mike Winter in 4-0 loss to Bermuda. He went on to play another seven games that year and one in 1974. His last cap came in a 7-0 loss to Poland on March 26, 1975.USA - Details of International Matches 1970-1979 In 1974, Ivanow became the San Jose Earthquakes (NASL) starting goalkeeper. In 1975, Ivanow played much of the season injured which dropped his GAA from the 1974 1.53 to 2.15. In 1976, he resumed his outstanding play before falling out of favor with the San Jose front office. He was transferred to the Seattle Sounders after six games. In Seattle, he was the backup goalkeeper to Tony Chursky. In 1977, Ivanow continued to back up Chursky, but came on for Chursky 17 minutes into the Sounders first post-season game, a victory over Vancouver. He started both games in the series with Minnesota, shutting out the Kicks on August 17. However, Chursky was back in the net for the rest of the post-season, including the Sounders‚Äô loss to the New York Cosmos in the 1977 Soccer Bowl. In 1978, Ivanow never made a game day squad, However, in January 1979, the Sounders traded Chursky to the California Surf for Al Trost. That year, Ivanow came alive, playing 28 games and finishing the season ranked fourth in the league. He was also the primary keeper during the Sounders' 1980-1981 indoor season. He played 15 of the team's 18 games and sixth in the goalkeeper standings. By the 1981 outdoor season, Ivanow was fading. His weight was increasing, decreasing his mobility and he found competition from Paul Hammond who was taking over in goal. At the end of the season, Ivanow retired from the Sounders and the NASL. Besides playing soccer, Ivanow has been involved in numerous businesses including co-founding and managing a credit union in San Francisco during his time playing with the Earthquakes. Today he is the sales manager for Jaguar of Bellevue.

His teams qualified for NCAA Regionals for 32 consecutive years, 23 at Miami and nine at Georgia Tech. Morris won national championships in 1999 and 2001, and earned National Coach of the Year honors in both seasons. Early career Morris began his coaching career as an assistant at Appalachian State in 1975. In 1976, he then accepted the challenge of building, from scratch, a baseball program at Atlanta's DeKalb Community College. At DeKalb, Morris started with no players and no field, but he quickly made a name for himself. His Eagles were nationally ranked three times in four years and advanced to the 1977 Junior College World Series. DeKalb finished second in just his second season. Morris added two more winning years at DeKalb before moving on to become an assistant coach at Florida State. Georgia Tech After a two‚Äìyear stint with the Seminoles, Morris would accept the head coaching job at Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets were on the backside of four straight losing seasons and were 4‚Äì23 in their first two seasons in the Atlantic Coast Conference. At Georgia Tech, Morris was the all-time leader in coaching victories, in any of the school's varsity sports, as he had 12 straight winning seasons, nine straight NCAA regional berths, four straight Atlantic Coast Conference titles (1985‚Äì88) and a school‚Äìrecord 51 wins in 1987. Miami In his tenure at the University of Miami, no other program has qualified for the College World Series as often as Morris and his Hurricanes. Miami, which has qualified for the NCAA Tournament a record 44 consecutive years, made it to Omaha in 11 of Morris' first 15 seasons in Coral Gables.

Many of these designs did not come to fruition for various reasons. Some were abandoned due to practical considerations. Others towards the end had to be abandoned, as the yards were overrun by allied forces. *The Type III U-boat was a 1934 project for a purpose-built minelayer based on the Type IA U-boat. The Type III U-Boat would have been similar to the Type IA, but with a hull lengthened by 7.5 m, and a total displacement of 970 tons. The Type III U-Boat was planned to carry an armament of 54 to 75 mines (depending on the type carried), two 105-mm deck guns, and one 20-mm antiaircraft gun. *The Type IIIA U-boat was a planned minelayer similar to the Type IA U-boat. It would have had a larger outer hull than the Type IA, and featured a large, watertight cylindrical hangar on the aft deck, which would have carried two small motor torpedo boats. The boat would have carried 48 mines, and used the smaller boats to help lay and recover mines. The project was dropped as impractical. *The Type IV U-boat was a planned resupply and repair U-boat, intended to meet other U-boats at sea and resupply them with torpedoes, fuel, food/water, and spare parts, and also be capable of performing light repair work. *The Type V U-boat was an experimental midget submarine designed by Hellmuth Walter using his hydrogen peroxide-fuelled turbine. Only one vessel, the V-80, was built. *The Type VI U-boat was a planned conversion of Type IA U-boats to run both submerged and surfaced from steam propulsion. *The Type VIIE U-boat was planned to make use of a lightweight engine, and with the saved weight, increase the thickness of the pressure hull - thus allowing for greater diving depths. The project was cancelled. *Little information is available on the Type VIII U-boat, other than it was planned for production in the event of mobilization in 1935. *The Type XI U-boat was planned as an artillery boat; its main armament would have been four 128-mm guns, in two twin gun turrets. It would have also carried an Arado Ar 231 collapsible floatplane. Four boats (U-112, U-113, U-114, and U-115) were laid down in 1939, but cancelled at the outbreak of World War II. Had the Type XI U-boat been constructed, it would have had a completely new hull design and a submerged displacement of 4,650 tons ‚Äì she would have been by far the largest of the U-boats and the second- largest diesel submarine after the Japanese I-400-class submarine. Its purpose was to engage ships (including escorts) in artillery duels at relatively long range, then dive away if they came within a certain threshold distance. Many anti-submarine escorts of WW2 including the Flower corvettes would have been too small and too poorly equipped with forward guns to cope with this approach. *The Type XII fleet U-boat was a design from 1938. It had eight torpedo tubes, six at the bow and two at the stern, and was to carry 20 torpedoes. The gun armament was to be the same as for the type IX boats. Designed size equal to the later, larger type IX version IXD model, but with even more powerful engines and motors planned, allowing faster speeds both above and below the surface. No contracts were granted for these boats. *The Type XIII was a further development of the type II coastal U-boat, with four torpedo tubes and one 20-mm antiaircraft gun. No contracts were granted for these boats. *The Type XV and XVI U-boats were intended for very large transport and repair boats (5,000-ton and 3,000-ton, respectively) intended to carry torpedoes, food, and oil as cargo. The engine layout was to be the same as for the VIIC. No contracts were granted for these boats. *The Type XVIII U-boat was a project for an attack boat using the Walter propulsion system. Two boats (U-796 and U-797) were laid down in 1943, but construction was cancelled in March 1944. *The Type XIX was a project for an unarmed transport U-boat, based on the Type XB mine layer. *The Type XX was another project for a transport U-boat based on the Type XB; it would have had a shorter hull than the Type XB, but had a greater beam and draft. Thirty Type XX U-boats were laid down in 1943, but construction stopped in 1944. In August 1944, construction on three Type XX U-boats (U-1701, U-1702, and 1703) resumed, but again stopped in early 1945. *The Type XXII U-boat was intended for coastal and Mediterranean use. They used the Walter propulsion system and would have had a crew of two officers and 10 men. They were to have three torpedo tubes, two at the bow (below the CWL) and one aft of the bridge (above the CWL). Initially, 72 contracts were awarded to Howaldtswerke (36 to the yard in Hamburg and 36 in Kiel), but of those, only two had been laid down and had received U-boat numbers (U-1153 and U-1154) before they were all cancelled in late 1943. *The Type XXIV was a 1943 design for an ocean-going U-boat using the Walter system. It was to have 14 torpedo tubes, six at the bow, and four each side aft. *The Type XXV U-boats were intended to be electric propulsion- only boats for coastal use. The design was 160 tons with a crew of about 58 men and would have had two torpedo tubes fitted at the bow. *The Type XXVI was a high-seas U-boat propelled by the Walter system. They would have had a crew of three officers and 30 men, with ten torpedo tubes, four at the bow and six in a so-called Schnee organ, and no deck guns; 100 contracts were initially awarded to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg (U-4501 through U-4600) and sections were under construction for U-4501 through U-4504 when the war ended.

Playing career Fearnley was a long serving member of the NSWRFL's Eastern Suburbs team, playing 144 matches for them at a bleak period in that club's existence in two stints 1954-55 and 1957-64. Injury kept him out of the 1960 grand final, one of the few successful years the Roosters enjoyed in that period. The front rower however was selected to represent his state, New South Wales that season.Alan Whitaker & Glen Hudson. The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. Gary Allen Press, Australia. 1995. () Coaching career Following his retirement from the game as a player, Fearnley enjoyed a successful coaching career, taking the Parramatta Eels to their first ever Grand Final in 1976 and then again in 1977. He had also been successful coach of the New South Wales rugby league team but stood down at the start of the 1978 NSWRFL season to concentrate on club football. Fearnley moved to coach Western Suburbs Magpies in 1982, Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks (1983‚Äì84) and Illawarra Steelers in 1988. Returning to representative coaching in 1985, he was the first successful New South Wales State of Origin coach, and was also selected as Australian coach for the mid-season New Zealand Tour. Selection controversy It was during his 1985 tenure as Australian coach that four players - all Queenslanders in Chris Close, Mark Murray, Greg Dowling and Greg Conescu - were controversially sacked in favour of New South Wales players (Steve Ella, Des Hasler, Peter Tunks and Benny Elias), despite Australia having won the first two Tests of the three match series. Fearnley also had a frosty relationship with Australian (and Queensland) captain Wally Lewis, with Lewis claiming to close friend and fellow Maroon Paul Vautin that Fearnley seemed to be conferring on team selections with vice-captain Wayne Pearce (who was also the new NSW captain following Steve Mortimer's representative retirement) rather than Lewis himself. Lewis claimed he had found the pair privately talking over selection of the Test team in Fearnley's hotel room, though this is disputed by Pearce who claimed he was there for different reasons. Dropping the four Queenslanders backfired on Fearnley as New Zealand defeated Australia 18-0 in the final Test of the series at Carlaw Park in Auckland. It was the first time since the final Test of the 1956 Kangaroo Tour that Australia had been held scoreless in a Test match. Queensland Rugby League Chairman, Senator Ron McAuliffe, publicly condemned the dropping of the four Queensland players from a winning Test side, saying \\"Its a football assassination and beyond all reasoning. And there can be no reasonable excuse for it\\". The NZ tour took place while the 1985 State of Origin series was still in progress. NSW had won the series for the first time, taking the first two games before the Australian team was chosen for the NZ tour. Fearnley would later claim that the Queensland players in the team were unhappy that they'd just lost the Origin series, though he later admitted he didn't handle the situation as well as he could have. In Origin game three that year played at Lang Park, one of the sacked players, Maroons prop Greg Dowling, aimed a tirade of abuse at Fearnley from the sidelines after a Queensland try. The Maroons went on to win the dead rubber game 20-6. NSW captain Steve Mortimer, who announced his representative retirement following the Blues win in game II at the Sydney Cricket Ground, later regretted his decision. After clearly out-playing Maroons half Mark Murray, he was in line for a test recall against the Kiwis and as team vice-captain he felt he could have used his personal friendship with both Fearnley and Lewis to ease tensions on the tour. Because of the controversy surrounding the NZ tour the Australian Rugby League instituted a new rule for national coaching which prevents any current serving State of Origin coach, being the national coach. Following his retirement as a coach, Fearnley wrote an article for Rugby League Week that was highly critical of Wally Lewis' captaincy. This gained him a rebuke from ARL officials. Death Fearnley died from cancer on 4 March 2015.

Justine Cooper Australian artist Justine Cooper created the marketing campaign as a social satire on the tactics used by the drug industry to sell prescription medications. The pseudo advertising campaign also examines our collective desire and expectation, that there is always room for improvement, and our doubts as to whether we are ever good enough, or have enough. Cooper stated she intended the exhibit to be humorous, but subtle. The campaign recreates the entire drug marketing process. It starts from the invention of a new disorder to the branding process of naming the drug, its pill and logo design, and promotional merchandise. The campaign was on display at the Daneyal Mahmood Art Gallery in New York City from February 8 to March 17, 2007 and included TV, print and billboard ads along with merchandise and branding material. Cooper had the initial idea while waiting for a flight at the Los Angeles International Airport. She viewed her first direct-to-consumer (DTC) pharmaceutical advertisements, promoting drugs for allergies, insomnia, depression, and erectile dysfunction, while watching the news on TV. DTC advertising is only allowed in the United States and New Zealand.

It is situated to the west of Hull city centre on the B1230 road. South Cave is approximately to the south-east. The civil parish is formed by the village of North Cave and the hamlet of Everthorpe. The 2011 UK census states that North Cave parish had a population of 1,667, a reduction on the 2001 UK census figure of 1,943. North Cave lies within the Parliamentary constituency of Haltemprice and Howden an area that mainly consists of middle class suburbs, towns and villages. The area is affluent and has one of the highest proportions of owner-occupiers in the country. Baines' History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York, stated that William the Conqueror gave the Lordship of both North and South Cave to Jordayne, who took the surname 'Cave'. This anecdote is not supported by evidence in the Doomsday Book, however. which does not list any landholder named \\"Jordayne\\". The book Identifies several Lords and Tenants-in-Chief for both North and South Cave; Beside King William himself, Robert Malet appears to be the primary landholder in 1086, but William I died in 1087, Leaving William II as successor, and so, some land may have transferred after 1086, but more evidence is required to lend credence to this family origin story. In 1823 North Cave was a civil parish in the Wapentake of Harthill and the Liberty of St Peter's. The Metham family of Metham had at North Cave a house which had been demolished. Existing at the time was a Methodist and a Quaker chapel. Population was 783, with occupations including seven farmers, two butchers, two corn millers, four shoemakers, five shopkeepers, two tailors, two wheelwrights, a blacksmith, two butchers, a paper maker, a bricklayer, two surveyors, one for highways the other for taxes, a schoolmaster, a gardener who was also the parish clerk, and the landlords of The White Horse and Black Swan public houses. Resident were three yeomen, a surgeon, a vicar, a gentleman and two gentlewomen. A carrier operated between the village and Hull twice a week. A Hull to London coach passed through the village twice a day. The Metham family held the old North Cave Manor house and built Hotham Hall as their new residence on the same estate. The grounds of North Cave manor house were landscaped by Sir George Montgomery Metham, owner 1763-1773. The Hotham estate was sold to Robert Burton in 1773, who incorporated the grounds of the manor house into those of Hotham Hall. The Metham family retained North Cave Manor, which later passed through inheritance to the Carver family who still own the site today, part of which operates as the Williams Den adventure playground. The Quaker preacher John Richardson was born in North Cave in 1667. Community North Cave War Memorial The church of All Saints was designated a Grade I listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. North Cave has a public house and a Church of England primary school. Its Sports and Social Club holds an annual Gala Day in June, Bonfire night in November and other events throughout the year. It has an equipped and safe play area for younger children. The village hall has undergone recent improvements and holds events and a play group for toddlers. It is the location for a local amateur dramatic group, the Cave Players, established for over 25 years, with pantomime and May productions. To the north of the village is Hotham Hall that was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The stable block at the hall is also listed as Grade II*. Many village shops have closed over the last twenty years in the face of competition from supermarkets, although a newsagent remains. The village and surrounding area magazine is Village Link, produced by a team of volunteers and distributed free. The web site, although no longer maintained, gives Parish Council and Sports and Social Committee information. North Cave Wetlands is a nature reserve of regional and national significance, containing a wide biodiversity. It attracts visitors from across the region.

Functionally the game is a compilation game mostly composed of the puzzles from Trilobyte's games The 7th Guest, The 11th Hour, and Clandestiny, but featuring little plot. The game has been noted for its low sales figures (27 in the US) and its rarity/obscurity relative to its blockbuster predecessors, The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour. The game is primarily intended as a means of presenting puzzles from the previous titles in the 7th Guest series and consequently it has a rather simplistic plot that has been criticized by reviewers for its thinness in comparison to the previous games.Delgado, Tony. COLUMN: 'Beyond Tetris' - The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour: Fossilization. Game Set Watch. 26 September 2007. The game also includes previews for two then-upcoming Trilobyte games, Tender Loving Care (eventually released by Aftermath Media) and Dog Eat Dog (never released). Plot Henry Stauf, the main antagonist from The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour is a toymaker with a dark and disturbed imagination inclined toward the macabre and the deadly. In Uncle Henry's Playhouse Stauf has created a twisted dollhouse, the 12 rooms of which he has furnished with miniaturized puzzles from his previous mansions. In the attic of the dollhouse Stauf has placed a thirteenth puzzle that can only be accessed once the player has satisfactorily completed the other 12 puzzles.Uncle Henry's Playhouse instruction manual. Trilobyte. 1996. As the player progresses through the game, Stauf observes the proceedings and offers commentary in the form of gleeful taunts for the player's failures and sounds of unhappiness for the player's successes. Gameplay Uncle Henry's Playhouse plays like the other two games in the series employing a simple point-and-click interface for 13 puzzles. The dollhouse that serves as the setting of the game includes 12 main rooms featuring puzzles from The 7th Guest, The 11th Hour, and Clandestiny (an unrelated title not in the 7th Guest series), an attic featuring an all-new 13th puzzle, and the foyer from which the player may access the guest book. Completing each puzzle in Uncle Henry's Playhouse automatically saves the game for the player allowing the player to quit at any time and then to start up again where he or she left off by signing in through the guestbook. Unlike the previous 11th Hour, there is no option to skip puzzles that the player finds too challenging although tips are available from the foyer.Claude, Frederick. Uncle Henry's Playhouse.

Diehard GameFAN's Alex Lucard described the game as one of \\"the biggest flops in PC gaming history.\\" Amongst other problems, the game's plot has been singled out by reviewers as lacking. The few positive critical reviews tended to emphasize the game's connection to its parent series, the fact that new content had been added to further the story of Henry Stauf, and emphasis was placed on the quality of the puzzles in contrast to the game's low price.Uncle Henry's Playhouse review.

Comparing the game to the 1995 puzzle classic, Hodj 'n' Podj, Computer Games Magazine even went so far as to claim that the puzzles in Uncle Henry's Playhouse worked better in a compilation format than they did as show-stoppers in the original games.Uncle Henry's Playhouse.

Commercial performance Having achieved sales topping 1 million units for The 7th Guest and setting CD-ROM industry records with 500 thousand preorders for The 11th Hour by late 1995, Trilobyte made the decision to switch from a development company to a publishing company. Fortunes reversed in 1996 and with millions of dollars tied up in development of the game, Tender Loving Care, Trilobyte found itself running very low on finances by mid-1996. In light of this, the decision was made that a third member of the 7th Guest series should be released to generate much-needed funds.Keighley, Geoff. \\"Haunted Glory: The Rise and Fall of Trilobyte\\".

It is found scattered throughout tropical rainforests and Kerangas forests. It is commonly found on hills and plateaus. The species is facing a high risk of extinction due to its scattered distribution and the decline in quality of its habitat. Description Agathis orbicula is a medium-sized tree of up to . Like all Agathis, Sarawak Kauri is generally possessed of a large, straight trunk. The trunk is usually branchless until close to the top where branches are retained which form a globular crown. The leaves range in shape from ovangular to circular, and are glaucous on their underside. The leaves are roughly two by three centimetres; juvenile leaves are much larger by comparison and are roughly twice the size of adult leaves. It can be inferred that the tree is similar in its appearance to other large trees of the genus, particularly Agathis borneensis. This is because it is likely A. orbicula was mistaken for A. borneensis. Cones The cones that the tree produces are approximately seven by five centimetres and display imbrication whilst the pollen cones are generally twelve by five millimetres, being quite small and having a bumpy texture due to the exposed microsporophylls. The cones are among the smallest in the genus Agathis when compared to the significantly larger pollen cones of other species such as Agathis robusta; its cones are in the millimetre range making them quite small. Bark The bark is described as being a deep brown and flaking off of the tree in irregular pieces and plates; it is also smooth and shiny. The underside of the bark is a reddish-brown colour with a granular texture and accompanied by a yellow resin produced by the sap of the tree. Timber The wood of the Sarawak Kauri is generally particularly straight-grained, and the colour of the timber beneath can range from a straw colour to reddish brown. It produces an attractive timber that is easily worked. However, due to an extreme scarcity and a loss of habitat the tree does not seem to be in use or ever have been used for commercial purposes.

Retrieved 2017-11-05. He was born at Leybourne in Kent in 1813, the son of an innkeeper.Brown RJ William Hillyer, The Cricketer, recorded at CricInfo. Retrieved 2017-11-05. Hillyer first played for Kent in 1834 and was the \\"principal bowler\\" for the county teams until 1853. He took at least 514 wickets for Kent teams in 89 matches - a figure which is not precise as bowling figures were frequently not recorded accurately. At the time, scores were generally low due to the roughness of pitches, which were kept short by sheep and rolled if at all only with a light roller. Playing in an era when round-arm bowling had taken over from underarm but before overarm bowling was legalised, Hillyer bowled a little above medium pace from a \\"shuffling run\\" with a beautifully simple delivery,Pearson, Harry The Trundlers, p.20 and was tremendously difficult to score off of due to his gain of pace off the pitch,Martin-Jenkins, Christopher Cricket, a way of life: the Cricketer illustrated history of cricket, p. 17. ability to make the ball come with his arm (from leg to off) and constant shooters which bowled many batsmen. He recorded at least 149 five-wicket hauls and took 10 wickets in a match at least 54 times, and 13 in at least 14 matches. By the tail end of the 1830s he was already established as one of the leading bowlers in English cricket. During the 1840s he was statistically unmatched. Until the days of James Southerton no bowler ever took so many wickets in a season as Hillyer's 174 in 1845 - his nearest rival, Jemmy Dean, had taken 100. He took most first-class wickets in English cricket in each season from 1842 to 1849. As a batsman Hillyer was more modest and he only reached 40 three times. Nonetheless, in by far his highest innings, Hillyer became the first player to accomplish the still-treasured feat of a \\"match double\\", scoring 26 and 83 and taking 13 wickets for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Oxford University in 1847.Frindall, Bill (editor); The Wisden Book of Cricket Records (Fourth Edition); pp. 317-320. He had first played for the Town Malling club and was employed as a professional by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's between 1838 and 1851, playing regularly in Gentlemen v Players matches during the period. From 1850 onwards, Hillyer began to decline badly, suffering from rheumatism and, beginning in 1852, he began to umpire as was normal practice with professional players of the day. He fell and broke his thumb in 1855 which forced his retirement as a cricketer. He died at Maidstone in Kent in 1861, aged 47.

The market was a large area where carts with goods that were sold at the local bazaar stopped. The place was rather dirty, unpaved area without capital buildings. Until the mid-1860s, the wheel dealers did not pay a market fee. Also, there was no own institution of measures and weights as in the ordinary market of those times . Privoz adjoined the Stary (old) bazaar (also called the Volny (free) market), the first bazaar in Odessa. The market was burned due to the outbreak of the plague and rebuilt in 1902. In 1904, the only architectural monument was built here - the Fruit Passage. Designed by the famous city architect Fedor Pavlovich Nesturkh, the Passage represented covered shopping galleries with arched entrances. In 2007, a meat and fish corps appeared, after which a shopping center called ‚ÄúNew Privoz‚Äù was built. Now the Odessa market is being restored and modified again, but it still does not lose its color and remains a place where they not only sell and buy, but also exchange the latest news. Stories In the 1940s zoo animals were moved from the Odessa zoo to Simferopol. Four-year-old elephant Murza (–ú—É—Ä–∑–∞) escaped. It ran to the fruit section of the Pryvoz Market and ate several apples, pulled out pickled cucumbers from a barrel, and tasted some fresh cabbage and dried fruits. Murza was caught and returned to the zoo. A popular Soviet comedy film, Striped Trip was inspired by this incident. In the 20s of the XX century, Privoz was led by the famous fraudster Jacob Pireman. One say he bought this post for a considerable bribe. Having become the head of the market, Pireman imposed a personal tribute to all merchants, and he also took hundreds of thousands of budget rubles to reconstruct the market and stole them. When Pireman's scam was uncovered, he was tried and shot. But one say that before the arrest, he hid a treasure - gold coins and diamonds on Privoz. People A western journalist explained his visit to the market: Privoz was also mentioned in The Odessa Tales of Isaak Babel.

Built in 1874, it served as the town's public library from then until 2002, when the library was moved to the former Center Methodist Church. The building, a fine local example of Second Empire architecture, now houses the local tourist board. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The former Provincetown Public Library building stands on Commercial Street, Provincetown's principal commercial street, at the northwest corner with Freeman Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a mansard roof providing a full third story. The exterior is finished in wooden clapboards, and the roof features a mansarded turret at the center of the front facade. The front is three bays wide, with a center entrance. Windows are sash, and are framed in a variety of different bracketed moulded hoods, some featuring simple cornices, with others have segmented-arch or triangular pediments. The main cornice is adorned with paired brackets, and a second cornice marks the transition between the differing slopes of the roof. A 1970s addition extends the building to the rear. The former library building was constructed in 1874, and was a gift to the town from Nathaniel Freeman. Originally, only the ground floor housed the library: the second floor housed a YMCA, and the third floor was used as commercial space. In the library's early years, the most colorful of its stewards was Abbie Cook Putnam. In 1977, the library ‚Äî by now the building's sole occupant ‚Äî was extensively renovated. The librarian at the time was Alice O‚ÄôGrady Joseph (d 2010), who was in charge from 1965 to 1982.Dunlap, D. W. (2015).

It is an important traffic junction in south-west Berlin that is served by the RegionalExpress and RegionalBahn trains of the Deutsche Bahn, the Harz-Berlin-Express of Veolia Verkehr and by the Berlin S-Bahn. In summer, Wannsee serves as the Berlin terminal for DB AutoZug car carrying trains to and from southern Europe. History Terminal building On 13 August 1961, with the construction of Berlin Wall, S-Bahn traffic from Stahnsdorf and Potsdam was discontinued. The only occurrence is that there is only Potsdam- Griebnitzsee shuttle until it was discontinued in 1962. Residents commuted only to East Berlin via the longer Berlin outer ring from Potsdam through regional express trains, and the only trains running on the Berlin‚ÄìMagdeburg railway was transit traffic from the West Berlin via the GDR to West Germany and other countries. Later on, after the fall of Berlin Wall, the line was re- connected to Potsdam again. Reconstruction began in April 1991 and was completed on 1 April 1992. Between the fall of Berlin Wall and 1 April 1992, Potsdam was connected through the fastest way via Griebnitzsee to interchange at Wannsee, besides transit traffic. S1 was temporarily extended from Wannsee to Potsdam Stadt from 2003 to 2006. S-Bahn line S1 terminates at Wannsee, and operates to and from central Berlin via the Nord-S√ºd-Tunnel. Line S7 passes through Wannsee on its route to Potsdam Hbf, and operates to and from central Berlin via the Stadtbahn. The two routes to central Berlin diverge by way a flying junction between Wannsee and Nikolassee stations. The station entrance building lies to the north of the station, and is linked to the platforms by a subway. To the south of the entrance are two island platforms used by the S-Bahn services, and then a single longer island platform used by Deutsche Bahn and Veolia trains.

It is 12 km south west of the Harare Central Business District. It shares the same estate with Eaglesvale Preparatory School which is the primary school. There are over 500 pupils in the senior school. Students, alumni and staff of Eaglesvale call their school 'Vale'. Eaglesvale Senior School and Preparatory School are members of the Association of Trust Schools (ATS) and the Headmasters are members of the Conference of Heads of Independent Schools in Zimbabwe (CHISZ). The schools participate in the festivals held by the National Institute of Allied Arts. History Eaglesvale Green Eaglesvale‚Äôs first home was in Bulawayo where it opened as the Bulawayo Orphanage on 30 January 1911, an establishment of the Dutch Reformed Church by Reverends A.J. Botha and J.N. Geldenhuys. In 1914 the Dutch Reformed Church then moved the school (orphanage) to Daisyfield Farm in Somabhula near Gweru with the intention of establishing a farm to produce food for the orphans. The school was renamed Daisyfiled. In 1948, the Dutch Reformed Church as the responsible Authority moved the school to the present site. This was a farm from Salisbury (now Harare). The school was built close to the railway line for easy transport. The school was renamed Bothashof School in honour of H Botha, son of Rev. A.J. Botha, also a Reverend of the Dutch Reformed Church. As the city expanded, most of the farm was sold giving in to industrial development in the early 1970s. In 1978 the school struggled to get students resulting in the Dutch Reformed Church, Central Africa, closing the school and selling the land to National Railways of Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia Railways). Eaglesvale View In 1982, the school reopened with one black student and the rest white. Due to the new Zimbabwean Government‚Äôs policy of education for all, the school enrolment increased to 400 in the Junior School and eight hundred in the Senior School. The principal was Mr Stokes. In 1985, Bothashof School was renamed Eaglesvale. In 1988, the school celebrated 40 years in Willowvale. J Bousfield joined the school in 1989 as the new headmaster. In 2002 Kenneth McKean took over as headmaster. Due to economic and other hardships, the school enrolment dropped to below 600. New subjects such as Design and Technology, Thinking Skills etc. were introduced to the curriculum and the enrolment stabilised. McKean left at the end of August 2008 and Mr Tirivavi took over as headmaster of the school. On 11 June 2010, the Dutch Reformed Church, Central Africa, surrendered the Daisyfield Trust which inter alia had the responsibility of Eaglesvale School to the Reformed Church in Zimbabwe under the leadership of Rev Dr Chomutiri as moderator. The Daisyfield Trust was renamed the RCZ Daisyfield Trust. All legal formalities were completed. On 13 February 2014, the Dutch Reformed Church Central Africa represented by Rev G A Brytenbach publicly handed over Eaglesvale School to the Reformed Church in Zimbabwe represented by the Moderator Rev Dr Rangarirai Rutoro. The event was attended by Local Government minister Ignatius Chombo, Education minister Lazarus Dokora and Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa. In 2015, Naison Tirivavi left the school with Mr. R. Ndawona, then deputy headmaster, assuming the role as acting headmaster of Eaglesvale Senior School. Mr. Dennis Anderson was appointed Headmaster of the Senior School from 1 May 2016. The school badge and motto The school badge consists of a shield divided into two fields horizontally and the motto of the institution underneath. The shield has a bible on a green background in the top division and an ox wagon on a maroon background in the bottom division of the shield. The badge symbolised the history of the people that founded the school who tried to live according to the Word of God. Diens is the school motto which means \\"Service\\" in the Afrikaans language.

Like many other flightless birds on isolated islands, it was a rail. It was declared extinct by Groombridge in 1994; BirdLife International confirmed this in 2000 and 2004. The bird was endemic to Ascension Island. Numerous subfossil bones of the bird have been found in deposits at the base of vertical fumaroles. Peter Mundy, a 17th century merchant and traveler gave an account of the bird and made a sketch of it when he visited Ascension Island in June 1656. It was described by Mundy as: It most likely lived in the near-desert areas of the island and primarily ate sooty tern (Sterna fuscata) eggs. It is probable that it became extinct after rats were introduced to the island in the 18th century, but it may have survived until the introduction of feral cats in 1815. The bird was regarded by Storrs Olson as a relative of Atlantisia rogersi, but recent analysis (Bourne et al., 2003) has shown that the differences between the two are greater than previously appreciated. The new genus Mundia (named after the discoverer Peter Mundy) was created in 2003. References *BirdLife Species Factsheet *del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A., & Sargatal, J., eds.

It is located off the Kamehameha Highway just inland from the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii, south of Kawela Bay. It is not open to the public. History In December 1939, the U.S. military established an Aircraft Warning Service (AWS) using radar to defend American territory. It employed the SCR-270 radar, the first United States long-range search radar created at the Signal Corps laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, circa 1937. The radar's operating frequency was 106 megahertz and it had a maximum range of 150 miles, or greater if the equipment was at an elevated site. Under the command of Col. Wilfred H. Tetley the AWS established six mobile radar detector sites on O'ahu at Kawaiola, Wainaae, Ka'a'awa, Koko Head, Schofield Barracks, and Fort Shafter. On Thanksgiving Day in 1941, the Schofield Barracks radar set was moved to the Opana Radar Site, a location 532 feet above sea level with an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean. The set comprised four trucks carrying the transmitter, modulator, water cooler, receiver, oscilloscope, operator, generator and antenna. Attack on Pearl Harbor On December 7, 1941, the Opana Radar Site was manned by Private Joseph L. Lockard and Private George Elliot, who detected approaching aircraft at 7:02 am (past the end of the site's scheduled operating day). Since the truck to take them to breakfast was late, the pair continued to practice with the radar equipment. The men reported their findings to the temporary information center at Fort Shafter. Pvt Joseph McDonald took the call. Private McDonald found Lt Kermit Tyler when he entered the plotting room when he timed the message. Tyler told him that it was nothing. McDonald called back the Opana Radar site and spoke to Pvt Joseph Lockard. Lockard was excited, he had never seen so many planes. Infected with Lockard's excitement, McDonald returned to Tyler. McDonald suggested to Tyler to call back the plotters and notify Wheeler Field of the sighting. When Tyler again indicated that it was nothing, McDonald insisted that Tyler talk to Lockard directly. The information center staff had gone to breakfast and Lt. Kermit TylerTyler died January 23, 2010, aged 96. See received the report. Tyler reasoned that the activity was a flight of Army B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, and advised the radar crew not to worry. Tyler told investigators that a friend in the Bomber group advised him that whenever the radio station played Hawaiian music all night, a flight from the mainland was arriving, and using that for navigation homing. McDonald was relieved at about 7:40 and returned to his tent waking his tent mate up by saying \\"Shim the Japs are coming\\". Elliot and Lockard continued plotting the incoming planes until 7:40 when contact was lost. Shortly before 8:00 am they headed to Kawailoa for breakfast and only learned about the attack when they arrived. Elliot and Lockard rushed back to Opana and operated the radar until the attack ended. Today Today, a modern Navy telecommunications station occupies the top of the Opana Hill adjacent to the site. The station is a relay for the Department of State's Diplomatic Telecommunications Service. The former site is a National Historic Landmark and IEEE Milestone. Since the 1941 radar was a mobile unit, there is no physical evidence of the historic unit at the site. There is a commemorative plaque on the grounds of the Turtle Bay Resort at the foot of Opana Hill.

History  The airport was constructed in the mid-1960s and became operational in the mid-1970s. Land measuring 224.16 acres was acquired for expansion of the airport in 2009. The work commenced in June 2009 and was completed in May 2010. The new terminal building, built at a cost of Rs. 30 crore, was inaugurated in June 2011. In 2015, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) was allotted land for the further expansion of the airport. In 2017, AAI upgraded infrastructure at Shillong, with the installation of an Instrument landing system (ILS), construction of two refuelling facilities, extension of runway and removal of flight-path obstructions. The airport received its Category 3C license from the Indian DGCA in June 2019, allowing operations of Q400/ ATR 72 aircraft. IndiGo began operations using an ATR-72 from Shillong on 20 July 2019 under the UDAN scheme with a daily flight from Kolkata airport. The present 6,000 ft runway was planned to be extended to about 8,000 feet to facilitate operation of narrow body jet aircraft like Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. However, this would require the cutting of clusters of hillocks that would come in the way of approaching aircraft after the runway was extended. The cost of this obstacle removal was 8,000 Crores. The Meghalaya Chief minister stated that it would be difficult to go ahead with expansion of the airport at that cost.

Bathymetry is contoured at a 200-meter interval. The inset shows the ridge location. The open white circle represents the approximately location of the Magic Mountain vent site. Pillow lavas and breccia overlain with slabby pieces of sulfide formed from hydrothermal venting on the east side of the Southern Explorer Ridge. Bathymetry image showing the crest of Southern Explorer Ridge. Purple and dark blue colors indicate deepest depths. The Explorer Ridge is a mid- ocean ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary located about west of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. It lies at the northern extremity of the Pacific spreading axis. To its east is the Explorer Plate, which together with the Juan de Fuca Plate and the Gorda Plate to its south, is what remains of the once-vast Farallon Plate which has been largely subducted under the North American Plate. The Explorer Ridge consists of one major segment, the Southern Explorer Ridge, and several smaller segments. It runs northward from the Sovanco Fracture Zone to the Queen Charlotte Triple Junction, a point where it meets the Queen Charlotte Fault and the northern Cascadia subduction zone. Geology This divergent boundary first formed about 5-7 million years ago when the northern end of the Juan de Fuca Plate broke off along the Nootka Fault to form the Explorer Plate. This apparently had some important ramifications for regional geologic evolution. When this change was completed, Cascade Arc volcanism from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia returned and the present-day Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains started to form.The Cascade Episode Retrieved on 2008-06-10 The oceanic crust is moving away from the Explorer Ridge to either side. On the eastern side the eastward moving Explorer Plate is being subducted under the North American Plate. The belt of volcanoes along the Pacific Ranges are the direct results of this collision. The western side of the Explorer Ridge is associated with the northwest trending Pacific Plate which has formed the Queen Charlotte Fault, an active transform fault along the coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska. The Explorer Ridge is also seismically active. Most seismicity recorded in this area occurred on or near the Explorer Transform Fault Zone. The relatively shallow depth of the Southern Explorer Ridge (up to 1800 m) in comparison with most other segments of the northeast Pacific spreading centers suggests that there has been considerable volcanic activity along this segment in the past 100,000 years.NOAA Ocean Explorer: Submarine Ring of Fire Retrieved on 2008-06-16 Notable features along the ridge The Explorer Ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the axis of the ridge along nearly its entire length. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates. Before 2002 Explorer Ridge was the least explored of the northeast Pacific spreading centers, even though it was known to have robust hydrothermal activity and is seismically active.Vents Program: Explorer Ridge Retrieved on 2008-06-10 Along the Southern Explorer Ridge lies a large hydrothermal vent area called Magic Mountain. It is an unusual hydrothermal site, with its off- axis location and relatively long-lived activity. The source of the hydrothermal fluid that fuels Magic Mountain probably rises along fault systems associated with a recent episode of rifting that, in turn, followed a massive outpouring of lava. These vents are forming seafloor massive sulfide deposits on the ocean floor. Many strange deep-water creatures have been found here.NOAA Ocean Explorer: Submarine Ring of Fire Retrieved on 2008-06-10 See also *Geology of the Pacific Northwest *Gorda Ridge *Juan de Fuca Ridge *Sovanco Fracture Zone *Volcanism in Canada References Underwater ridges of the Pacific Ocean Plate tectonics Mountain ranges of British Columbia Volcanism of British Columbia Coast of British Columbia Seismic zones of British Columbia ","title":"Explorer Ridge"},{"id":"9549927","text":"Jean Elizabeth Coussins, Baroness Coussins, (born 26 October 1950) is a British parliamentarian and an adviser on corporate responsibility.

It is owned by the Indian Air Force, and the Airports Authority of India operates a civil enclave at the airport. Although designated an international airport in 2005, the Srinagar airport does not receive scheduled international flights as of April 2020, but has seen Hajj flights. It has an integrated terminal and one asphalt runway which is capable of handling large passenger jets like the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. The airport is actually located in Budgam, which is 4 km from Srinagar. History Originally, the Srinagar airport was used only by the Indian Air Force. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the airport received an airlift of Indian troops who prevented Pakistan from capturing the city of Srinagar. Although the airport was small and lacked landing aids, the airlift was still carried out successfully on 27 October. In September 1965, the Srinagar airport was subjected to an air raid amid the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, which left some aircraft damaged. In 1979, the Airports Authority of India established a civil enclave at the airport. The terminal was modified in February 1998 to be able to handle international Hajj flights, which first started operating from Srinagar in January 2002. During the Kargil War in 1999, the airport was taken over completely by the Air Force, and civilian flights were prohibited from landing. In March 2005, the airport was granted international status by the Indian government. In 2006 the airport was renamed Sheikh-ul-Alam International Airport after the Kashmiri patron saint. An expanded terminal, able to serve both domestic and international flights, was inaugurated on 14 February 2009 by politician Sonia Gandhi. It was part of a larger expansion project that also included an increase in the number of parking stands from four to nine. The total cost of the project was , fully provided by the Indian government. On the same day, Air India Express started once weekly flights to Dubai, the first regularly scheduled international flights from Srinagar. However, due to low demand from passengers, the flights were terminated in January 2010. The authorities were planning to create a new airport terminal handling International flights as of 2019. Infrastructure The Srinagar airport has an integrated terminal, handling both domestic and international flights. It covers and can serve 950 passengers at a time: 500 domestic and 450 international passengers. The terminal is designed to look like the Himalayas and has a sloping roof that facilitates snow removal. Amenities include a restaurant, a handicrafts shop, ATMs, currency exchange, chocolates shop, and free WiFi. There are 4 aerobridges linked with the terminal. There is a single asphalt runway, 13/31, with dimensions . It has been equipped to handle instrument landing system approaches since February 2011. Several food joints like KFC and Pizza Hut are also available in the airport since 2018.  Night landing  In December 2017, it was announced that the airport would handle night operations. Later in August 2018, a test flight was conducted by DGCA Team and it was passed. As of June 2020, the airport does not handle any night operations. Airlines and destinationsNotable accidents and incidents Special areas are created for praying in Srinagar Airport. On 7 September 1965, amid the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, four fighter jets of the Pakistan Air Force attacked the Srinagar airport. An Indian Air Force Douglas C-47 Skytrain and an Indian Airlines Douglas DC-3 were destroyed during the air raid. A Chicago Tribune article published the following day reported that one Indian aircraft and a \\"Caribou transport of the United Nations observers headquarters\\" were damaged. Access The airport is located about from the city of Srinagar. There is a car park with 250 spaces. The government provides a paid bus service between the airport and the Tourist Resource Centre near Lal Chowk, while the Airports Authority of India operates a free bus service between the terminal and the airport entrance gate away. The airport is also served by taxis and car rental agencies, which have their booths outside the terminal.

It was built in 1372, and stands 27 metres (88.5 ft) above the ground. It is the tallest religious structure in the city. The pagoda was given the name of Wat Preah Chedey Borapaut. Wat Phnom is the central point of Phnom Penh. History Legend relates that a wealthy widow called Penh (commonly referred to as Daun Penh, Grandmother Penh, in Khmer) found a large koki tree in the river. Inside the tree she found four bronze statues of the Buddha. Penh constructed a small shrine on an artificial hill made by the people living in the village to protect the sacred statues. Eventually this became a sacred site and sanctuary where people would make blessings and pray.

In 2015, the Phnom Penh municipality was planning to renovate the monument. Architecture The sanctuary itself was rebuilt several times in the 19th century and again in 1926. The interior has a central altar complex with a large bronze seated Buddha surrounded by other statues, flowers, candles and items of devotion and worship. The walls are covered with murals, especially of Jataka stories of the Buddha's earlier reincarnations before his enlightenment. There are also murals depicting stories from the Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana. The newer murals in the bottom tiers are somewhat balanced, traditional and modern. The southwest corner of the temple and stupa, is a small shrine dedicated to Lady Penh. The front is often crowded with the faithful bringing their prayers and food offerings to the woman deemed responsible for the founding of the wat.

The film stars Tom Long, Greta Scacchi, Colin Friels, and Anna Torv. It was produced by Al Clark, with original music by Cezary Skubiszewski. Plot Daniel (Tom Long), an Australian classical dancer, is drugged and abducted in an alley by three hooded women. They proceed to hold him in an abandoned warehouse for about two weeks, mutilating him sexually and using him for their own physical and psychological gratification, before dumping him blindfolded from a car near his home. Traumatised, Daniel neither reports his kidnapping and rape to the authorities, nor reveals it to family, friends or colleagues. In the aftermath, he loses his ability to dance and has problems readjusting to normal life. His sceptical live-in lover, a ballerina, suspecting that he was unfaithful to her during his absence, leaves him. Obsessed with finding the culprits, who he has reason to believe are from the vicinity, he dates every woman who bears a resemblance to his abductors, hoping to identify them. This leads him into trouble with the law, and to an eventual breakdown that may or may not prove cathartic. The film concludes on this ambiguous note, with Daniel weeping in the arms of a policeman. Themes and Interpretations Since release of the film there have been a number of interpretations relating to how Kokkinos re-imagined the rape-revenge genre. One interpretation is that the film successfully reimagines the rape-revenge genre through its role reversal of gendered norms: specifically the male rape victim as opposed to a female.

Although religion still held sway, erotica had started ebbing out.Sarkar, Nilhil, \\"Printing and the Spirit of Calcutta\\" in \\"Calcutta, the Living City\\", Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p135, Oxford University Press, . However, his father fell ill and died shortly after establishing the printing press. Vidyabhusan inherited the press and published in Bengali two volumes on the history of Greece and history of Rome, he had written. That was possibly the first time that fat volumes of history written in easy flowing Bengali language was published and it immediately established Vidybhusan as a writer.Majumdar, Swapan, Literature and Literary Life in Old Calcutta in \\"Calcutta, the Living City\\", Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 113, Oxford University Press, . Somprakash Front page of Somprakash, 17 June 1861 Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar proposed the publication of a weekly newspaper Somprakash partly with the objective of providing employment for a deaf scholar. The newspaper hit the stands in 1858 but the deaf scholar never joined it. The entire responsibility of editing and publishing the newspaper vested in Vidyabhusan. At that time, Bengali newspapers such as Sambad Prabhakar and Sambad Bhaskar were 'defiling the moral environment in Bengal'. With its dignified tastes, lucid language and fearless criticism, Somprakash occupied the top position in the field of Bengali newspapers. Initially, Somprakash was published from a lane in Champatala in Kolkata. When the railway was extended to Canning in 1862, he shifted the printing press to his native village Chingripota (renamed as Subhashgram), now in South 24 Parganas. It strongly criticised the powerful indigo planters and landlords. In his evidence before the Indigo Enquiry Committee, Rev. James Long emphatically stated, \\"These periodicals play a significant role as the mouthpiece of the Indian public.\\"Sengupta, Nitish (2001) History of the Bengali-speaking people, p238-239, New Delhi : UBS Publishers' Distributors. . In 1878, when the viceroy, Lord Lytton, introduced the Vernacular Press Act, specially targeting the Bengali press, Vidyabhusan closed down Somprakash, rather than sign an undertaking about it, agreeing to follow the dictates of the authorities. Sir Richard Temple, lieutenant governor, called him to his house and requested him not to close down the newspaper. Later, when the Act was withdrawn, he resumed publication of Somprakash, but it never regained its past form and glory. Later life He established an English school in his native place called Harinavi DVAS High School(Harinavi Dwarkanath Vidyabhusan Anglo Sanskrit High School) and bore the expenses of running the same. A man of high moral standards he stood by the down trodden in society. With advancing age, his health started faltering. He published a monthly magazine Kalpadrum for sometime. Once he went and stayed in Varanasi for sometime and was shocked by the wretched state of affairs of religion and morals. He died at Satna where he had gone to recoup his health. Sivanath Sastri was his sister's son. Works History: History of Greece, History of Rome (both in Bengali). Text books: Nitisar, Pathamrita, Chhatrabodh, Bhusansar Byakaran.

It is known in most non-English languages as RTL (for Radio Television Luxembourg). The English-language service of Radio Luxembourg began in 1933 as one of the earliest commercial radio stations broadcasting to the UK and Ireland. The station provided a way to circumvent British legislation which until 1973 gave the BBC a monopoly of radio broadcasting on UK territory and prohibited all forms of advertising over the domestic radio spectrum. It boasted the most powerful privately owned transmitter in the world (1,300 kW, broadcasting on medium wave). In the late 1930s, and again in the 1950s and 1960s, it had large audiences in Britain and Ireland with its programmes of popular entertainment, and was an important forerunner of pirate radio and modern commercial radio in the United Kingdom. Radio Luxembourg's parent company, RTL Group, continued its involvement in broadcasts to a UK audience with the British TV channel then known as Five until it was sold in July 2010. Background and origins In 1922, the British government awarded a monopoly broadcasting licence to the British Broadcasting Company, whose shares were owned by British and American electrical companies. Although in theory the BBC could have sold sponsored airtime, instead its income came from selling its own brand of licensed radio receivers manufactured by its owners. This arrangement lasted until 1927, when the broadcasting licence of the original BBC was allowed to expire. The assets of the former commercial company were then sold to a new non-commercial British Broadcasting Corporation, which operated under a UK charter from the Crown. With no possibility of commercial broadcasting available from inside the UK, Leonard F. Plugge ‚Äì a former British Royal Air Force captain and entrepreneur (and from 1935 Conservative Party member of parliament) ‚Äì set up his own International Broadcasting Company, which leased time on transmitters in continental Europe and resold it as sponsored English-language programming aimed at audiences in Britain and Ireland. Because Plugge successfully demonstrated that State monopolies such as that of the BBC could be broken, other parties became attracted to the idea of creating a new commercial radio station specifically for this purpose. Formation of Radio Luxembourg In 1924 radio technician Fran√ßois Anen built a 100-watt transmitter in his home, located in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Within two years the government of Luxembourg had reached an agreement to subsidize the station to broadcast military music concerts and plays performed in the local dialect of Luxembourg. With its central location in western Europe, the Grand Duchy was an ideal site for broadcasts to many nations, including the United Kingdom. Anen became inspired by the activities of Captain Plugge, who was using transmitters licensed in other countries to broadcast English-language radio programmes to Britain and Ireland, whose governments had not licensed commercial broadcasting. On 11 May 1929, he brought together a group of mainly French entrepreneurs and formed the Luxembourg Society for Radio Studies (La Soci√©t√© Luxembourgeoise d'√âtudes Radiophoniques) as a pressure group to force the Luxembourg government to issue them a commercial broadcasting licence.Walter B. Emery, National and International Systems of Broadcasting, Michigan State University Press, 1969, pp.158‚Äì159.Mike Leonard, From International Waters Forest Press, Heswall, 1996, p.5. On 19 December 1929, the government of Luxembourg passed a law awarding a monopoly licence to operate a commercial radio broadcasting franchise from the Grand Duchy. On 29 December, this licence was awarded to the Society, which in turn created the Luxembourg Broadcasting Company (Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion) to be identified on the air as Radio Luxembourg. In May 1932, Radio Luxembourg began high powered test transmissions aimed directly at Britain and Ireland (which proved, inadvertently, to be the first radio modification of the ionosphere). The reaction of the British government was hostile, as the long-wave band used for these tests carried a signal far superior to anything previously received from outside the country. The British government accused Radio Luxembourg of \\"pirating\\" the various wavelengths it was testing. The station had planned to commence regular broadcasts on 4 June 1933, but the complaints caused Radio Luxembourg to keep shifting its wavelength. On 1 January 1934, a new international agreement, the Lucerne Convention or European Wavelength Plan (which the Luxembourg government refused to sign), came into effect, and shortly afterwards Radio Luxembourg started a regular schedule of English- language radio transmissions from 8:15 am until midnight on Sundays, and at various times during the rest of the week. Radio Luxembourg began broadcasting in both French and English on a new 200 kW transmitter on 230 kHz (1304 metres) in the long-wave band. The English service was leased to Radio Publicity (London) Ltd in the United Kingdom. In December 1933, they transferred 23-year-old Stephen Williams from directing their English-language programmes transmitted over Radio Paris to become the first manager of the English language service of Radio Luxembourg. From 1932, German journalist and LGBT-activist Eva Siewert worked as editor-in-chief and trilingual head spokeswoman for the station in German, English and French. First commercial era=1933‚Äì1939 In the years from 1933 to 1939 the English language service of Radio Luxembourg gained a large audience in the UK and other European countries, with sponsored programming aired from noon until midnight on Sundays and at various times during the rest of the week. 11% of Britons listened to it during the week, preferring Luxembourg's light music and variety programmes to the BBC. Up to half of Britons did so before 10:15 am on weekdays when the BBC did not broadcast, and at weekends when it followed the \\"Reith Sunday\\" schedule of only serious and religious programmes. The BBC and successive British governments continued to oppose the competition, citing Radio Luxembourg's use of an unauthorized frequency. As the station could not use General Post Office telephone lines to broadcast from London, many English-language programmes were recorded there and flown to Luxembourg. Despite the opposition, by 1938 many British companies advertised on Radio Luxembourg and fellow European broadcaster Radio Normandy. The stations thus exposed millions of Britons and British companies to commercial broadcasting, which contributed to the creation of the commercial ITV during the 1950s.

The date is Wednesday 9 August 1939, three weeks before the declaration of war. =Programmes= These were some of the shows heard in 1935 as listed in the 3 May edition of Radio Pictorial: *Sundays: 12:00 Noon ‚Äì Musical Voyage ‚Äì with Bobbie Comber and Reginald Purdell and sponsored by Halls Wine. **12:15 pm ‚Äì Do-Do Broadcasts ‚Äì sponsored medication programme \\"for asthma suffers\\". **12:30 pm ‚Äì Golden Hour of Music ‚Äì the Irish Concert recorded programme **1:00 pm ‚Äì Zam-Buk Broadcast ‚Äì the latest dance music sponsored by a medication \\"for cuts, burns and bruises.\\" **1:30 pm ‚Äì Littlewoods Broadcast ‚Äì sponsored by a football pools coupon company in Liverpool. **2:00 pm ‚Äì English service ends until 2:30 pm. **2:30 pm ‚Äì Vernon's All-Star Variety Concert ‚Äì gramophone records presented by a football pools company. **5:30 pm ‚Äì League of Ovaltineys ‚Äì presented by the makers of Ovaltine.

Ogden- Smith (Chief Announcer in 1938) World War II=1940‚Äì1945 On 21 September 1939, the Luxembourg government closed the radio station down to protect the neutrality of the country during World War II. The station and its transmitters were taken over by the invading German forces in 1940, and were used for English-language propaganda broadcasts by William Joyce (\\"Lord Haw- Haw\\") and others. When Allied forces took over Luxembourg in September 1944, the station was transferred to US Army control and used for black propaganda purposes for the remainder of the war (see Radio 1212). Second commercial era=1946‚Äì1956 When the Allied armed forces vacated the Radio Luxembourg premises at the close of World War II, the English-language service attempted to restart transmissions to the United Kingdom as a full-time commercial radio station using the European long-wave band, once more under the management of Stephen Williams. During the war, Geoffrey Everitt served his last few months in Luxembourg, and this led to his employment by Stephen Williams on 21 June 1946. Williams soon left the station and Everitt found himself in charge of a small on-air staff of three women and one man. Because of the dearth of advertising available in English, the early morning shows on long wave quickly disappeared and made way for French-language programmes. More contractions followed and this led to cuts in more of the morning, afternoon and evening programming in English. By the start of the 1950s, sponsorship of the English service had begun to grow once more, and while initially some of the English-language programmes continued via Radio Luxembourg I on long wave, a second but less powerful wavelength was opened up as Radio Luxembourg II on medium wave. The English programmes of Radio Luxembourg moved on 2 July 1951, from long wave to the medium wave frequency of 208 metres (1439 kHz). The controversy over the station's broadcasting frequencies had been resolved with the 1948 Copenhagen plan (which this time the Luxembourg government did sign), which allocated the country two high- power frequencies, one on long wave and the other on medium wave. Eventually all English programming moved to medium wave, with long wave being dedicated to French programmes, while German, Dutch and other languages used medium wave during the daytime. In 1955, Hal Lewis who was better known at Hawaiian radio station KPOA as J. Akuhead Pupule (and later became the morning DJ at KGMB in Honolulu, Hawaii during 1965), offered to buy the morning time from 6 am to 9 am for his own show on 208, but his offer was rejected. The 208 signal could be received satisfactorily in the United Kingdom only after dark, when it was able to strike the ionosphere and bounce back to the British Isles. It was this second wavelength that eventually became dedicated to English-language programming after 6 pm under the slogan of \\"208 ‚Äì Your station of the stars\\", referring to the entertainers heard on the station. =Programmes= March 1952 advertising for the Dan Dare Monday to Friday serial as it appeared in 208, the programme listing guide to Radio Luxembourg in English.

Radio Luxembourg also served as a refuge for stars and shows previously heard on the BBC but with whom the BBC had fallen out for one reason or another. Thus, when in 1951 the BBC wanted Vera Lynn, one of its biggest singing stars, to perform more upbeat material than her traditional repertoire, she refused, and signed up to record 42 shows for Luxembourg instead ‚Äì which, she said, also paid better. Likewise, the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, terminated by the BBC after six years, transferred to Radio Luxembourg for a period in 1950‚Äì51 before the BBC relented and revived the show.George Nobbs, The Wireless Stars, Norwich, 1972, SBN 903 61900 8 On 7 April 1956, Billboard magazine reported that \\"WINS Radio made a deal with Harry Alan Towers of the Towers of London, for deejay Alan Freed to do a special taped 1/2 hour rock and roll record show on Saturday nights over Radio Luxembourg, which is beamed to most of the countries of Free Europe.\\" =Presenters= Resident announcers in Luxembourg at different times: *Stephen Williams ‚Äì the English service manager before World War II, resumed his duties when commercial broadcasting began again. *Ursula Brennan ‚Äì Patricia Giles ‚Äì Beatrice Feltes ‚Äì John De Denghy ‚Äì record presenters who all left the station with Stephen Williams around 1948. *Geoffrey Everitt ‚Äì joined Radio Luxembourg on 21 June 1946 after being demobbed from British Army in Luxembourg.

In later years he became the London-based boss of the entire English-language operation. *Teddy Johnson ‚Äì joined in May 1948 and he and Everitt ran the English service in Luxembourg by themselves until 1950 due to the lack of advertising income.

July 1958. Following the merger of the English-language service of Radio Luxembourg I with the new English-language service of Radio Luxembourg II on 208 metres medium wave, the station came to be known as Radio Luxembourg. A British company, Radio Luxembourg (London) Ltd, controlled the programme content and sold the advertising time. The station sign-on time at dusk varied between summer and winter to allow maximum benefit to be gained from a skywave propagation at night that covered the British Isles, although reception was strongest in northern England. By restricting the service to night-time, the sales representatives were able to sell most of the available airtime both for spot commercials and for sponsored programmes. One spot commercial that became burned into the minds of every Radio Luxembourg listener was for Horace Batchelor's \\"Infra-Draw Method\\" of winning money on football pools, turning the previously obscure Somerset town of \\"Keynsham, spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M\\" into a household name throughout the country. Some programmes were live disc-jockey presentations by the team of \\"resident announcers\\" from the studios in Luxembourg City, while others were pre- recorded in the company's British studios at 38 Hertford Street, London W1. This was never made clear to listeners, who were allowed to form the incorrect impression that all the presenters were broadcasting from the Grand Duchy or, alternatively, assume that all the programmes were recorded in London. A conspiracy of silence operated throughout this period between sworn enemies Radio Luxembourg and the BBC, each of which never mentioned the existence of the other, although many famous names appeared on both, often almost simultaneously. =Programmes= During this period, and particularly from about 1960, the station's output came to be more explicitly targeted at the growing teenage market, with increasing emphasis on pop music. Drama productions, comedy, variety and sports programming disappeared altogether. By about 1963, almost all the station's output was based around the playing of music on discs; the mainstream evening audience for middle-aged \\"family entertainment\\" had by this time largely migrated from radio to television. These were some of the shows heard in December 1956, as listed in the 208 programme schedule for that month: *Sundays: 6:00 pm ‚Äì Butlin's Beaver Club ‚Äì with \\"Uncle\\" Eric Winstone. **8:30 pm ‚Äì Take Your Pick ‚Äì with Michael Miles. **9:30 pm ‚Äì This I Believe ‚Äì the Edward R.

He returned to Luxembourg in 1975 and remained on the staff until his death in 1982. *Chris Denning *Colin Hamilton *Ted King *Johnny Moran *Don Moss, 1957‚Äì60 *Don Wardell (became Chief Announcer after Alldis left in 1966) The following disc-jockeys recorded shows in the London studios at 38 Hertford Street: Peter Aldersley, Sam Costa, Alan Dell, Keith Fordyce, Alan Freeman, David Gell, Tony Hall, Jack Jackson, David Jacobs, Brian Matthew, Don Moss, Pete Murray, Ray Orchard, Jimmy Savile, Shaw Taylor, Jimmy Young, and Muriel Young. Many of these programmes were sponsored by record companies, and in order to include as many records as possible, most programmes played little more than half of each record. 1964‚Äì1967 Radio Luxembourg enjoyed a monopoly of English-language commercial radio programming heard in the UK until, in March 1964, Radio Caroline began daytime commercial transmissions to southern England from a ship anchored less than four miles off the Essex coast (the station later acquired a second ship, and moved the first to the Irish Sea). In Caroline's primary reception areas, her ground wave signal was strong and unaffected during daylight hours by fading or interference. Following the success of this first offshore station, others soon followed, mostly broadcasting from off the Essex coast or in the Thames Estuary. These transmissions were later extended around the clock and featured many different broadcasting formats, though pop music on discs predominated. As a result of this competition, Radio Luxembourg gradually abandoned pre- recorded sponsored programmes for a more flexible continuity. Its new format featured mainly spot advertising within record programmes presented live by resident disc jockeys in Luxembourg, some of them recruited from the offshore stations. In August 1967, the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act passed into British law, and forced all but the two Caroline stations off the air by eliminating their means of selling commercial advertising in the UK. As well as closing down offshore \\"pirate radio\\", the British government instructed the BBC to create its own non-commercial replacement, named Radio 1, which began transmissions at the end of September 1967. While Luxembourg again almost had the UK commercial airwaves to itself, it was still restricted to evening and night hours. =Presenters= The presenters included the following:Source: Peter Alex, \\"Who's Who in Pop Radio\\", London, 1966 (British Library: 000047169) *Pete Brady, Radio London Big ‚Äì L 266 *Tony Brandon, Radio London Big ‚Äì L 266 *Paul Burnett, Radio 270 *Dave Cash, Radio London Big ‚Äì L 266 *Simon Dee, Radio Caroline, BBC TV *Noel Edmonds BBC *Kenny Everett, Radio London Big ‚Äì L 266, BBC *Stuart Grundy *Tommy Vance, Radio London Big ‚Äì L 266, Radio Caroline South *Keith Skues, British Forces Network, Radio Caroline 199, Radio London Big ‚Äì L 266 *Johnnie Walker, Swinging Radio England, Radio Caroline South All the ex-Radio London DJs worked later for BBC Radio One. 1968‚Äì1988 By the middle of 1968, even the two Caroline offshore stations had left the air and, while other attempts were made to restart offshore radio commercial broadcasts aimed at the UK in the early 1970s, Luxembourg did not face commercial competition, only a growing increase in audience share by more BBC services. For a time in the late 1960s Luxembourg advertised itself as \\"The O.I.S. ‚Äì the Only Independent Station on the Air\\". But in 1973, the BBC radio monopoly was finally ended by new legislation introducing Independent Local Radio, funded by the sale of advertising time. In 1983, Radio Luxembourg marked its fiftieth anniversary as a station, but the British commercial radio stations kept whittling away the 208 audience and advertising, while a brief replay of competition for audiences began to emerge from off the British coastline with new radio ship transmissions. =Programmes= These were shows heard in 1982 as reported in the Radio Luxembourg Research Report (page 20) of 208 listeners. The Survey was conducted during the last quarter of 1982 by British Market Research Bureau for Radio Luxembourg (London) Ltd. By the time the survey appeared, the programme line-up below had changed in various ways, including the untimely death of Barry Alldis in the middle of the survey: *Sundays: 7:00 pm ‚Äì Haunted Studio ‚Äì with Stuart and Ollie Henry. 9:00 pm ‚Äì Star Chart and Top 30 UK Singles ‚Äì with Tony Prince. 11:00 pm ‚Äì Sunday's Top 20s ‚Äì with Barry Alldis and Rob Jones. 1:00 am ‚Äì Earthlink ‚Äì with Benny Brown. *Mondays: 6:45 pm ‚Äì Radio Outreach with John Knight; Battle of the Giants; Top 30 Airplay; Top 30 Disco ‚Äì with Rob Jones and Benny Brown. 1:00 am ‚Äì Earthlink ‚Äì with Barry Alldis. *Tuesdays: 6:45 pm ‚Äì 208 Editorial with Rodney Collins; Beatle Hour; Daily Mirror Rock and Pop Club; Top 30 UK; Top 30 Albums ‚Äì with Rob Jones and Barry Alldis. 9:00 pm ‚Äì Top 30 UK; Top 30 Albums ‚Äì with Benny Brown. 1:00 am ‚Äì Earthlink ‚Äì with Mike Hollis. *Wednesdays: 7:00 pm ‚Äì Gold and Games ‚Äì with Rob Jones and Benny Brown. 9:00 pm ‚Äì American Top 30 ‚Äì with Bob Stewart. 11:00 pm ‚Äì Top 30 Easy Listening ‚Äì with Benny Brown. 1:00 am ‚Äì Earthlink ‚Äì with Mike Hollis. *Thursdays: 7:00 pm ‚Äì The Number Ones; Top of the Pops ‚Äì with Bob Stewart and Mike Hollis. 9:00 pm ‚Äì Top 30 Futurist ‚Äì with Rob Jones. 11:00 pm ‚Äì Discoth√®que ‚Äì with Benny Brown.

The end eventually came for 208 at 3 am GMT on 30 December 1991 (the station did return to the analogue 208/1440 for one night a year later when the station finally closed its digital service), with the last record played on AM being Van Morrison's \\"In the Days Before Rock and Roll\\" (chosen mainly because of its mention of the radio station), before \\"At the End of the Day\\" (one of their closedown songs) was played heading into the top of the hour (even though DJ Jeff Graham had said that they were going to play the original closedown tune, it was in fact the original song, but a later version the station used as the original was not located, \\"It's Time To Say Goodnight\\"). The station then went satellite and shortwave (15350 kHz) only, with the first songs played being \\"When Will You (Make My Telephone Ring)\\" by Deacon Blue and \\"Always\\" by Atlantic Starr. The satellite and shortwave service continued until midnight on 30 December 1992. The closedown night was relayed on various stations, including the old 208 wavelength. The Van Morrison song was the next-to-last record that night, followed by Marion Montgomery's \\"Maybe the Morning\\". The 208 service from that moment on carried an oldies service in German, identifying itself as \\"RTL Radio ‚Äì Der Oldiesender\\". Presenters in the 1990s: *Chris Moyles (under the professional name Chris Holmes) *Jonathan Miles *Mike Hollis *Bob Stewart, (ex-Radio Caroline North) *Mark Page *Peter Antony *Wendy Lloyd *Tony Adams *Shaun Tilley, (ex-Radio Caroline South) *Jeff Graham *Steve Joy *Sandy Beech *David Bozzato *Jodie Scott (ex Caroline 558 DJ. Canadian, on Caroline as Judy Murphy) *Nik Martin *Jessie Brandon, (ex Laser 558) Legacy from 1992 onwards=Atlantic 252 In 1989, Radio Luxembourg's parent company RTL Group teamed up with Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann to create Atlantic 252, an English-language pop music station on longwave, based in Ireland and with advertising content aimed at a UK audience. Initially this only broadcast until 7 pm and ended with an announcement specifically encouraging listeners to switch to Radio Luxembourg on 1440 kHz medium wave. Atlantic 252 switched to 24-hour broadcasts around the time that Radio Luxembourg shut down its medium wave broadcasts. Atlantic 252 closed down in 2002 and the long wave frequency is now used for RT√â Radio 1. Presenters common to both Atlantic 252 and Radio Luxembourg include Jeff Graham, Cass Jones and Sandy Beech. The voice of Henry Owens was also heard on promotions for both stations in the early 1990s. * Charlie Wolf, ex DJ Laser 558 * Andrew Turner, ex Newsreader BBC & Laser Hot Hits 576 Radio Luxembourg (digital) An English-language classic rock digital station from RTL Group called Radio Luxembourg began in 2005. It was briefly available in the UK using DRM (digital broadcasts over shortwave) but the transmitter power was reduced, and by 2008 was not receivable outside Luxembourg itself (essentially, a test transmission). The digital station continues broadcasting over the Internet. Both the station and its website make numerous references to the old 208 service. Five (television channel) RTL Group, Radio Luxembourg's parent company, was an initial minority shareholder in the UK's Channel Five terrestrial analogue television channel, launched in 1997. RTL became the majority shareholder from 2006, when it had been re-branded as \\"Five\\". It was one of more than fifty television stations that RTL owned throughout Europe. Unlike RTL's television stations in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, most of which are explicitly branded as RTL, Five did not significantly acknowledge its Luxembourg heritage on-air. RTL sold Five to Richard Desmond on 23 July 2010. Background information Radio Luxembourg was also broadcast on RTL's various European TV channels after closedown. Transmitter history The wavelengths and frequencies used by the English service of Radio Luxembourg changed throughout the years, although \\"208\\" was by far the longest-lasting and most famous one. *Marnach transmitter *Junglinster Longwave Transmitter *FM- and TV-mast Hosingen Radio Luxembourg publications *Radio Pictorial ‚Äì radio publication pre-World War II that published programme schedules for all the European continental stations broadcasting in English *Radio Parade ‚Äì radio publication after World War II that published news about Radio Luxembourg in English. *208 ‚Äì radio programme schedules and features after 1951 until 1959 whose name varied as it was merged with other publications and issued by various publishers. *Fab 208 ‚Äì radio programme schedules and features publication during the 1960s and 1970s See also: \\"Radio-Luxembourg, Histoire d'un m√©dia priv√© d'envergure europ√©enne\\", by David DOMINGUEZ MULLER, L'Harmattan, Paris, 2007. Political significance in Eastern Bloc Radio Luxembourg was one of few channels through which people living in the Eastern Bloc could listen to rock and other contemporary popular music. Under good weather conditions, and especially at night, people as far as eastern Czechoslovakia, Poland http://www.radioluxembourg.co.uk/?page_id=30 and Estonia could listen to the station. Eastern Bloc governments did not use jammers to prevent people from listening to Radio Luxembourg, but did do so for Radio Free Europe and, since the stations used harmonic frequencies (1439 kHz for Luxembourg and 719 kHz for Free Europe), the jamming also affected Radio Luxembourg's signal. Even though western popular music was considered undesirable by socialist regimes, legal prosecution was rare, although not unheard of. The music appealed to young people as something forbidden, and listening to it became a social ritual. It also strongly influenced contemporary underground culture and music in Czechoslovakia.

She led the Progressive Labour Party (PLP) in opposition before being appointed Bermuda's first female Attorney-General. She first gained recognition in 1953 as Bermuda's first female barrister. Browne-Evans died of a suspected stroke on 29 May 2007, three days before her 80th birthday. Background Browne-Evans was educated at King's College London and became Bermuda's first female barrister in 1953 after being called to the bar at Middle Temple in June 1953. She was the first black woman to be elected to the House of Assembly of Bermuda, defeating the long-serving incumbent Sir Bayard Dill, becoming the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Devonshire North constituency in 1963. Five years later she became the leader of the PLP, gaining worldwide recognition as the first female Leader of the Opposition in the British Commonwealth. In 1972 she stepped down as leader but took on the role of Jamaica's Honorary Consul in Bermuda, the first Bermudian to serve in that capacity. From 1976 to 1985 she again led the PLP in opposition. In 1998, the PLP achieved its first electoral victory. Browne- Evans was appointed Minister of Legislative Affairs and became the country's first female Attorney-General in 1999. That year, she circumvented a party ban on accepting British honours when she accepted the title of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth II, forcing the PLP to abandon its boycott. She debated at the London and Bermuda Constitutional Conferences and served as delegate to numerous international conferences in Africa, New Zealand, the USA and the Caribbean. Outside politics Browne-Evans was a member of the International Federation of Women Lawyers and a founding member of the Bermuda Business and Professional Women's Club. She was the first female member of the Devonshire Recreation Club and a founding partner of Browne & Wade Chambers in Hamilton. Position on independence Despite her damehood, Lois Browne-Evans said after a keynote address by Premier Alex Scott at a Founder's Day Luncheon in 2004 that Bermuda would achieve independence from the UK within five years. Family Lois Marie Browne was born on Parson's Road, Pembroke, one of four children of James Browne, a contractor and owner of the Clayhouse Inn, and his wife Emmeline (n√©e Charles). Her parents and grandparents emigrated to Bermuda from Nevis and St. Kitts in 1914, part of a large influx of West Indians that had begun in the latter years of the 19th century.J. Randolf Williams, Lois: Bermuda's Grand Dame of Politics, Camden Editions, 2001, pp. 16‚Äì17. She married Trinidadian- born John Evans in 1958, and the couple had three children: Ernestine, Donald, and Nadine. John Evans co-founded, in 1976, the West Indian Association of Bermuda. Legacy Several months after her death, the PLP government under Premier Dr. Ewart Brown decided that a planned new police station/court house would be named after Browne-Evans. In 2008, Brown's government created a National Heroes Day holiday to commemorate Browne-Evans, intended to replace the existing national holiday Bermuda Day (later changed to replace the Queen's Official Birthday).

She was subsequently referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital, where she was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy and given a prognosis that she would not live to reach the age of two years; however, it was her younger sister, Sally, who died from the same disease before that age. As a child she was prone to getting severe chest infections, which occurred two or three times per year, sometimes requiring hospitalisation. Education Campbell went to a segregated school for disabled children where academic achievement was not the top priority. Her best friend, who had a hole in the heart, died at the age of 13 years. She left school at the age of 16 years with no qualifications, and hardly able to read or write, but she nevertheless regarded herself as quite intelligent. In 1975 she enrolled at Hereward College, Tile Hill, Coventry; a special college for disabled students where there was an academic environment, and where she was generally able to enjoy the life-style of an ordinary teenager. While there she gained six O-levels and three A-levels within three years. From Coventry she went to Hatfield Polytechnic, and then became an MA at the University of Sussex with a dissertation on Sylvia Pankhurst. Career In 1996 Campbell co-founded and directed the National Centre for Independent Living (NCIL) where she worked for six years before being appointed by the Minister for Social Care to chair SCIE. She is an active leader in the social care field and a campaigner and adviser for disability reforms. As chair at the British Council of Disabled People, and co-director at NCIL, Campbell saw these organisations through pioneering work in the field of independent living, civil rights, peer counselling and equal opportunities. In 1996 she co-authored a book entitled Disability Politics, and was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the Queen's 2001 Birthday Honours. In 2003, Campbell was awarded an honorary doctorate in law from Bristol University and another in social sciences from Sheffield Hallam University. Currently, she is exploring the notion of a human rights perspective of social care. In February 2007, it was announced by the House of Lords Appointments Commission that she would be made a life peer and would sit as a crossbencher. Her peerage was gazetted as Baroness Campbell of Surbiton, of Surbiton in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames on 30 March 2007. Personal life Campbell met her first husband, Graham Ingleson, at Hereward College; they married when she was 27 years old. He was a haemophiliac, and six weeks before the wedding they discovered that he had contracted HIV from a blood transfusion, from which he later died. She currently lives in the Kingston borough district of Tolworth, with her second husband Roger Symes, a businessman. Because of her physical weakness Campbell requires help to do almost everything, and needs a ventilator to help her breathe at night. She uses an electrically powered wheelchair and has a computer on which she types with one finger. She receives a direct payment from the local authority for her care needs, which enables her to employ five female carers to help her with the routine activities of daily living.

Details of the saint's life vary. Marina probably lived in the 5th century, and the first biographical account was probably written sometime between 525 and 650; it is preserved in several manuscripts, including one from the tenth century.Alice-Mary Talbot, Holy Women of Byzantium: Ten Saints' Lives in English Translation (1996, ), page 2 Legend Marina (in some Western traditions, or MaryStavroula Constantinou, Female Corporeal Performances (2005, ), page 95 or Mariam in other manuscript traditions) was the child of wealthy Christian parents. Her mother died when Marina was very young, so Marina was raised as a devout Christian by her father Eugenius. As Marina approached marriageable age, her father intended to find his child a husband and then retire to the Monastery of Qannoubine in the Kadisha Valley of Lebanon. When Marina learned of his plan, she asked why he intended to save his own soul \\"and destroy mine.\\" When asked by her father, \\"What shall I do with you? You are a woman\\", Marina answered that she would live as a monk with him: she then shaved her head and changed into men's clothes. Eugenius, seeing his child's strong determination, gave all his possessions to the poor and traveled with Marina to the Kadisha Valley to live in monastic community life, where they shared a cell. She took the name Marinos. The other monks attributed his soft voice to long periods of prayer, or else believed their new brother was a male eunuch.G. G. Bolich, Crossdressing in Context, vol. 4: Transgender & Religion (2009, , pp. 86-87Roland Betancourt, Transgender Lives in the Middle Agesthrough Art, Literature, and Medicine After ten years of prayer, fasting and worship together, Eugenius died. Now alone, Marina became only more intently ascetic and continued to conceal her sex. One day, the abbot of the monastery sent her with three other monks to attend to some business for the monastery. As the journey was long, they were forced to spend the night at an inn. Also lodging there was a soldier of the eastern Roman front. Upon seeing the beauty of the inn keeper's daughter, who was working there, the soldier seduced her and defiled her virginity, instructing her to say, \\"it was the monk, Father Marinos, who has done this to me\\" should she conceive a child. After some time, it was discovered that the inn keeper's daughter was pregnant and, as was agreed, she told her father that Marinos (Marina) was to blame. On hearing the story, the man went furiously to the abbot of the monastery. The abbot calmed the man and told him that he would see to the matter. He called for Marina and reprimanded her severely. When Marina realized what was happening she fell to her knees and wept, confessing her sinfulness (without explicitly stating how she had sinned) and asking forgiveness. The fact that there was no attempt to deny the fault made the abbot so furious that he told Marina to leave the monastery. She left at once and remained outside the gates as a beggar for several years. When the inn keeper's daughter gave birth, he took the child and gave him to Marina. So Marina raised the child. She fed the child with sheep's milk, provided by the local shepherds, and remained caring for him outside the monastery for ten years. Finally the monks convinced the abbot to allow Marina to return; he accepted but he also imposed heavy penalties upon Marina, who was to perform hard labour in cooking, cleaning and carrying water in addition to regular monastic duties and caring for the child. At the age of forty, Marina became ill. Three days later she died from the illness. The abbot ordered that Marina's body be cleaned, her clothes changed and that she be transferred to the church for funeral prayers. While fulfilling these tasks, the monks discovered that she was, in fact, born a woman. This made them very distressed. The monks informed the abbot, who came to Marina's side and wept bitterly for the wrongs done. The abbot then called for the inn keeper and informed him that Marina was born a woman. The inn keeper went to where the body lay and also wept for the pain and suffering which he had unjustly brought upon Marina. During the funeral prayers, one of the monks, who was blind in one eye, is said to have received full sight again after he touched the body. It was also believed that God allowed a devil to torment the inn keeper's daughter and the soldier, and that this caused them to travel to where the saint was buried, where they confessed their iniquity in front of everyone and asked for forgiveness. Today, Coptic Orthodox Christians say that Marina's body is kept at Saint Mary Church and has not decomposed. It is displayed to the public on Marina's feast day, on Mesra 15.https://st-takla.org/books/youssef-habib/st-marine/miracles.html http://www.wataninet.com/2014/07/ŸÉŸÜŸäÿ≥ÿ©-ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸäÿØÿ©-ÿßŸÑÿπÿ∞ÿ±ÿßÿ°-ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∫Ÿäÿ´ÿ©-ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßÿ±ÿ©-ÿßŸÑ/161308/ Veneration Marina is venerated in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox ChurchesRobert Elsie, A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture () and the Coptic Orthodox Church.

Relief map showing major rivers of Australia Climate of Australia The Australian environment ranges from virtually pristine Antarctic territory and rainforests to degraded industrial areas of major cities. Forty distinct ecoregions have been identified across the Australian mainland and islands. Central Australia has a very dry climate. The interior has a number of deserts while most of the coastal areas are populated. Northern Australia experiences tropical cyclones while much of the country is prone to periodic drought. Agriculture and mining are the predominant land uses which affect the Australian environment. The management of the impact on the environment from the mining industry, the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, forests and native animals are recurring issues of conservation. Clean Up Australia Day was an initiative developed in 1989 to collaboratively clean up local areas and is held on the first Sunday of autumn (in March).  Issues  Major environmental issues in Australia include whaling, logging of old growth forest, irrigation and its impact on the Murray River, Darling River and Macquarie Marshes, acid sulfate soils, soil salinity, land clearing, soil erosion, uranium mining and nuclear waste, creation of marine reserves, air quality in major cities and around polluting industries and infrastructure, pesticide and herbicide impacts and growing of genetically modified food. Increased coal mining in Australia is contentious because of the effects of global warming on Australia, emissions to air from coal burning power stations, dust, subsidence, impact on rivers like the Hunter River and other water users, failure to adequately restore mined areas, and lack of sustainability. As an example, in 1999 Australia's energy consumption of coal and coal products was 47,364 thousand metric tons oil equivalent, compared to that of the world's energy consumption of coal and coal products which totalled 2,278,524 (also measured in thousand metric tons oil equivalent). Climate change and global warming are of particular concern because of the likely effects of global warming on agriculture, the Great Barrier Reef and tourism industry, human health through mosquito-borne crydiologicyticlogy. Sea level rise could also have a profound impact on under levelled and poorer communities and waterfront suburbs. The range of rises forecast by the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report would be sufficient to have impacts in many areas, and if the Greenland ice cap melts faster than forecast, it could have a disastrous impact. In urban areas, noise and odour are major sources of complaints to environmental protection authorities. Protected areas Protected areas cover 895,288 km2 of Australia's land area, or about 11.5% of the total land area. Of these, two-thirds are considered strictly protected (IUCN categories I to IV), and the rest is mostly managed resources protected area (IUCN category VI). There are also 200 marine protected areas, which cover a further 64.8 million hectares. Indigenous Protected Area have been established since the 1990s, the largest of which covers part of the Tanami Desert in the Northern Territory. The protected natural areas include world heritage listed properties, such as the Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh/Naracoorte), Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves, Fraser Island, Great Barrier Reef, Greater Blue Mountains Area, Heard and McDonald Islands, Lord Howe Island, Macquarie Island, Purnululu National Park, Shark Bay, and the Wet Tropics of Queensland. Protected mixed World Heritage listed areas include Tasmanian Wilderness, Ulu·πüu-Kata Tju·πØa National Park, Willandra Lakes Region and Kakadu National Park. Ningaloo Reef and Cape Range peninsula are submitted and on the Tentative List for World Heritage listing and are Australian National Parks.  Land  Map of Australian vegetation Although most of Australia is semi- arid or desert, it covers a diverse range of habitats, from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests, and is recognised as a megadiverse country. Because of the great age and consequent low levels of fertility of the continent, its extremely variable weather patterns, and its long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique and diverse. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic. Many of Australia's ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and introduced plant and animal species. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is a legal framework for the protection of threatened species. Numerous protected areas have been created under the national Biodiversity Action Plan to protect and preserve unique ecosystems; 65 wetlands are listed under the Ramsar Convention, and 16 World Heritage Sites have been established. Australia was ranked 13th in the world on the 2005 Environmental Sustainability Index. Most Australian woody plant species are evergreen and many are adapted to fire and drought, including many eucalyptus and acacias. Australia has a rich variety of endemic legume species that thrive in nutrient-poor soils because of their symbiosis with Rhizobia bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Well-known Australian fauna include monotremes (the platypus and echidna); a host of marsupials, including the kangaroo, koala, wombat; and birds such as the emu and kookaburra. The dingo was introduced by Austronesian people who traded with Indigenous Australians around 3000 BCE.Savolainen, P. et al. 2004. A detailed picture of the origin of the Australian dingo, obtained from the study of mitochondrial DNA. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 101:12387‚Äì12390 PMID Many plant and animal species became extinct soon after first human settlement, including the Australian megafauna; others have become extinct since European settlement, among them the thylacine.  Water  Australia is the second driest continent (after Antarctica), and frequent droughts have led to the introduction of water restrictions in all parts of Australia. This has led to concern about water security in Australia by environmentalists, irrigators and state and federal governments. Diversion and capture of natural water flows for irrigation in Australia has been responsible for dramatic changes in environmental water flows, particularly in the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin. The major part of Snowy River flows was diverted by the Snowy Mountains Scheme.  Carbon dioxide emissions Energy resources of Australia Australia has the highest per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions among \\"major western nations\\", 10th highest overall, and is the 16th highest total emitter of any country. Tons of CO2 per year per capita (as of 2005, without land-use changes): *Australia: 26.9 *United States: 23.5 *Canada 22.6 *United Kingdom: 10.6  State of the Environment reports = Commonwealth of Australia  The State of the Environment (SoE) section has responsibility for environmental reporting and implements two key interrelated initiatives: the State of the Environment report and the Essential Environmental Measures for Australia program. State of the Environment report The SoE section leads the development and production of the Australia: State of the Environment. The report is a comprehensive national assessment of the state of our environment produced every five years based on the best available evidence. It is tabled in accordance with section 516B of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conversation Act 1999, by the Minister for the Environment and Energy. The SoE report provides a vital resource for policy makers, industry and NGOs, educational institutions, the science community and the general public. Essential Environmental Measures for Australia The section also leads the development of the Essential Environmental Measures (EEM) program to strengthen environmental reporting. The EEM program aims to improve our capacity to track trends in the State of Australia's environment and engages with environmental experts to: * identify measures that are essential for tracking change in the state of the environment and * make measure-related data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Over time, it is anticipated that information provided through the program will become a core component of the evidence used to inform national state of the environment reporting and environmental-economic accounting. Sydney *2003 *2006 *2009  Victoria  South Australia  Western Australia  The southwest coastal area has a Mediterranean climate and was originally heavily forested, including large stands of the karri, one of the tallest trees in the world. This agricultural region of Western Australia is in the top nine terrestrial habitats for terrestrial biodiversity, with a higher proportion of endemic species than most other equivalent regions. Thanks to the offshore Leeuwin Current the area numbers in the top six regions for marine biodiversity, containing the most southerly coral reefs in the world. Average annual rainfall varies from 300 millimetres (12 in) at the edge of the Wheatbelt region to 1,400 millimetres (55 in) in the wettest areas near Northcliffe, but in the months of November to March evaporation exceeds rainfall, and it is generally very dry. Plants must be adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils. A major reduction in winter rainfall has been observed since the mid-1970s, with a greater number of extreme rainfall events in the summer months. The central four-fifths of the state is semiarid or desert and is lightly inhabited with the only significant activity being mining. Annual rainfall averages 200‚Äì250 millimetres (8‚Äì10 in), most of which occurs in sporadic torrential falls related to cyclone events in summer months. An exception to this is the northern tropical regions. The Kimberley has an extremely hot monsoonal climate with average annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 1,500 millimetres (20‚Äì60 in), but there is a very long almost rainless season from April to November. Eighty-five percent of the state's runoff occurs in the Kimberley, but because it occurs in violent floods and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils, the only development has taken place along the Ord River. The black swan is the state bird of Western Australia. The red-and-green kangaroo paw is the floral emblem of Western Australia. Occurrence of snow in the state is rare, and typically only in the Stirling Range near Albany, as it is the only mountain range far enough south and with sufficient elevation. More rarely, snow can fall on the nearby Porongurup Range. Snow outside these areas is a major event; it usually occurs in hilly areas of southwestern Australia. The most widespread low-level snow occurred on 26 June 1956 when snow was reported in the Perth Hills, as far north as Wongan Hills and as far east as Salmon Gums. However, even in the Stirling Range, snowfalls rarely exceed 5 cm (2 in) and rarely settle for more than one day. The highest observed maximum temperature of 50.5 ¬∞C (122.9 ¬∞F) was recorded at Mardie Station on 19 February 1998. The lowest minimum temperature recorded was ‚àí7.2 ¬∞C (19.0 ¬∞F) at Eyre Bird Observatory on 17 August 2008.

History Along with the Sex Pistols and The Damned, the Automatics regularly played the Marquee Club in London and toured clubs around the U.K. and Europe. Their hit song \\"When the Tanks Roll Over Poland Again\\", (released on Island Records in 1978) was number one on the punk/new wave charts. It was one of the first records to be produced by Steve Lillywhite, who was Philp's flatmate at the time, and who went on to produce U2. It is listed at 22 of the top 50 punk songs from that era by Punks Reunited. The Automatics also played gigs with Johnny Thunders and The Heartbreakers and Thunders himself played on the Automatics first album, Walking with the Radio (available through Angel Air, UK). The Automatics toured England with the Vibrators and played the Reading Festival in 1979. In 1980, Dave Philp moved to California, where he remained lead singer and songwriter for the Automatics but with different players in the band. This early history is recounted in No More Heroes: A Complete History of UK Punk from 1976 to 1980 by the English critic Alex Ogg. As punk declined in popularity, Philp went into business for himself in Los Angeles, California, but continued to write, record songs and play small clubs as the Automatics. Yet, even he was surprised in 2000 when a punk rock record promoter in Tokyo contacted him about releasing his first album and going on tour in Japan. Toshio Iijima of Base Records had Philp play sold-out clubs in Tokyo and Kyoto being backed by Japanese punk musicians who had memorized both the music and lyrics of his first record. The success of that tour led Iijima to bring Philp back to Japan in 2002 and 2004. He also released two more albums: 2 in 2002 and Forty Virgins in the Afterlife in 2004. The improbable and belated rediscovery of Philp led National Public Radio's Ira Glass to conduct an interview with Philp on This American Life. Under \\"Return to Childhood\\", Philp is featured in \\"Act II, Punk in a Grey Flannel Suit\\". This radio interview led to his life story being optioned by Hollywood film producers on two occasions. It also prompted one of Philp's earliest supporters, DJ John Peel, to interview him for BBC Radio in London. The Automatics albums released through Base Records in Japan were produced by Jim Wirt (Incubus, Hoobastank, Fiona Apple, No Doubt and Jacks Mannequin). In 2006, bassist Wirt (formerly of Fool's Face), became a regular member of the band and brought on drummer Paul Crowder (formerly of Eric Burdon, Flogging Molly) and lead guitarist Brian Coffman (Fool's Face). Wirt, Crowder and Coffman joined Philp to become the Automatics for the 2006 Britannia album, which is a collection of songs about England and Englishness from an expatriate's point of view released on Dork Records UK/U.S. Veteran DJ Mike Read in London invited Philp to tour England playing some of the songs in the summer of 2006 and the single \\"Old River Thames\\" went to number one on the Big L/Capital Radio charts in London in January 2007. After the release of Britannia in the U.S. in the spring of 2007, other songs found airplay among independent DJs such as Jonathan L at KUPD-Phoenix, leading Philp to perform at the South by Southwest event in Austin, Texas. By September 2007, other singles had found airplay including \\"England Expects\\", \\"Who Died and Made You Brian Jones\\" and \\"British Beat\\", which features guitar work by Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols. Though Philp's style has changed and is more oriented to song-writing and less toward pure punk, Britannia still features many of his friends from the punk rock days including Ian McCallum (Stiff Little Fingers), Mick Rossi (Slaughter and The Dogs), and Michael Des Barres (Power Station). In 2008, Automatics released \\"Jukebox of Human Sorrow\\" which is available for download from iTunes.

It was written by Darryl Quarles. The film revolves around a group of convicts on a mission in Vietnam to rescue the daughter of a rich man. Plot The film shows a scene of a girl being kidnapped from a charity plane by Vietnamese rebels (a U.N. supplies [as in food and medicine] plane) in Vietnam. Then we are taken to the United States to a detention center in Los Angeles where the warden of the center and 6 of the toughest prisoners are hired to rescue the girl, whose name is Gabrielle Presscott, daughter of Jameson Prescott, CEO and billionaire. Warden Toliver and prisoners (by last name only, their first names are never revealed) Butts and Monster (black youths), Lopez and Vasquez (Latino youths, with Vasquez being a girl), and Brophy and Lamb (white youths). The group travels to Vietnam with three days to rescue Gabrielle, spending one day to train and the rest of the days to find her. After winning a battle the group spends the night at a village brothel and has a small celebration, with Brophy sneaking away into the night. The group awakens to find the rebels with Brophy as a hostage and asking the villagers to hand over the rest of the Americans. The group decides to attempt a rescue for Brophy and are successful, however, Lopez and Monster are both killed during the fight. The group runs away into the jungle and is tiredly marching along when Lamb steps on a landmine. While Toliver is trying to disarm the mine, some rebels are slowly getting nearer and nearer to the group. Brophy once again sneaks away but sacrifices himself, bringing another death to the group. Toliver and his men finally arrive at the rebel base camp, with Toliver combing the camp for Gabrielle. After he finds her he returns to the others and hands each of them a set of explosives to be detonated by a timer. After setting all of the charges, the group is found out and a battle ensues. The group kills scores of rebels but there is no apparent end in sight, forcing the group to retreat. The group is driving away in a stolen armored truck when a missile explodes inches away from the truck. The rebel leader has taken a chopper and followed the band of \\"soldiers\\". But Butts had secretly put a charge in the chopper back at the base, and detonates it, killing the rebel leader. The group heads home and the camera shows a chopper flying away into the Vietnamese sunset.

It‚Äôs here where you can see glimpses of a decent movie trying to get out. Once Dudikoff and his ‚ÄúBoyz‚Äù start soldiering, it‚Äôs not much to write home about.\\" Matt Poirier from Direct to Video Connoisseur said about \\"Soldier Boyz\\": \\"It's as bad as the synopsis sounds. I'm not even sure I recommend renting it. It's just so bad. If you see it on TV, and you got nothing else going for a couple of hours like I did, you may want to give it a shot. Otherwise, I'd say this is too silly for even the most seasoned bad movie veteran. Watch a lot of other Dudikoff first, and then come back to this. It should only be seen in the context of Dudikoff as a DTVC Hall of Famer.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film has 2 reviews listed, both are negative.

The road is approximately in length, and runs through the center of the Carolina Forest development (which is projected to have a population of 56,000 residents when completed). A one-mile (1.6 km) segment near Carolina Forest Plaza and US 501 is five lanes and narrows into two lanes near Carolina Forest Elementary School. It ends at Village Center Boulevard, just after intersecting River Oaks Drive; having access to South Carolina Highway 31 and US Highway 17. History Previous to the development of Carolina Forest, the path of Carolina Forest included scattered logging roads in the immense tract of land owned by International Paper. West Perry Road and various other dirt logging roads, as evidenced on earlier maps, make out a rough path of the current roadway. In November 1995, the first part of Carolina Forest Boulevard was completed, which would help provide an loop throughout the tract of land along with River Oaks Drive. The two roads would link the new development of Carolina Forest with the older River Oaks development several miles east. The western of the boulevard were initially five lanes designed to carry heavy traffic to the new Carolina Forest Plaza, the U.S. Post Office, Carolina Forest Elementary School, two golf courses, and several residential neighborhoods. In August 2004, a third lane was added near Carolina Forest Elementary School to accommodate school traffic. In October 2007, eastern parts of Carolina Forest Boulevard were expanded to accommodate the commercial development in the Town Centre area of Carolina Forest. River Oaks Drive, along with International Drive, were both widened to five lanes in the area. In February 2008, it was announced that bids were being taken to widen Carolina Forest Boulevard to five lanes from Carolina Forest Elementary School to Walkers Woods. The widening project commenced in April 2008. The project was completed in mid-August 2008 with a stoplight and pedestrian walkways added at Gateway Road. Postal Way, an additional traffic connector in the area, opened as a separate project in November 2008 which coincided with the finalizations of the Carolina Forest Boulevard road project. Plans Carolina Forest Boulevard was recently extended into the Village Square Shopping Center and currently terminates at Village Center Boulevard. Plans call for the entire road to be widened into a multi-lane, divided highway running through the center of Carolina Forest. As of June 2011, of the road still needs widening, at a cost of $9 to $10 million, with bicycle paths to be included.

Accessed March 28, 2007. Jerusalem has long been embedded into Jewish religious consciousness and Jews have always studied and personalized the struggle by King David to capture Jerusalem and his desire to build the Holy Temple there, as described in the Book of Samuel and the Book of Psalms. Many of King David's yearnings about Jerusalem have been adapted into popular prayers and songs. Jews believe that in the future the rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem will become the center of worship and instruction for all mankind and consequently Jerusalem will become the spiritual center of the world. Early traditions in the Hebrew Bible The earliest tradition regarding Jerusalem states that Adam, the first man, was created from the same place where in future the Altar would stand in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. After he was ejected from the Garden of Eden, he returned to this spot to offer a sacrifice to God. Cain and Abel also brought their offerings on this Altar. It is believed that Adam lived in Jerusalem for all of his life. The Altar in Jerusalem remained as a permanent shrine where all people could worship God until it was destroyed by the Flood. After the Flood, Noah rebuilt it. The Bible records that Noah blessed his son Shem, which indicated that Jerusalem would be included in Shem's inheritance. Shem and his progeny lived in Jerusalem and set up an academy there where the word of God was taught. When the city became large enough to require government, Shem was crowned king and given the title \\"Malchi-Tzedek\\". Tzedek, meaning righteousness, a name used to refer to Jerusalem. In ancient times the city was divided, with the ‚ÄúLower City‚Äù to the east and the ‚ÄúUpper City‚Äù on a higher elevation to the west. The eastern section was referred to as Salem, while the upper section which included the place of the Altar was called the Land of Moriah. 340 years after the Flood, Canaanite tribes began to invade the Holy Land and the Amorites occupied the western Upper City and subsequently destroyed the Altar. Shem and his people retained control of the Lower City and maintained the academy there. Some legends tell that Abraham went to Jerusalem as a young child to study the tradition with Noah and Shem. God later instructed Abraham to leave Mesopotamia and return to the Promised Land. After he was victorious in a war he got caught up in, he was blessed by Shem. Shortly after, eastern Jerusalem ‚Äì Salem ‚Äì began to come under the domination of the Philistines who were occupying the area. In order to make peace with them, Abraham went to negotiate with their king Abimelech who assured him safety of Shem's academy. When Abraham‚Äôs son and heir Isaac was born, Abimelech approached Abraham in order to make a covenant between them. The treaty stipulated that as long as a descendant of Abimelech dwelt in the land, no descendant of Abraham would wage war against them. This covenant was later to be the reason why the Israelites would not capture the eastern part of Jerusalem. When Abraham was told to sacrifice his son, God directed them to Moriah. When the spot where the Altar had stood became apparent to Abraham he rebuilt it and prepared to sacrifice Isaac on it. It was after he passed this last test, he took Shem‚Äôs place as the Priest of the Altar on Mount Moriah. Abraham named the place ‚ÄúYirah‚Äù or Yiru (Jeru), meaning awe. When this was united with the name of the eastern part of the city, the city got its present name JeruSalem, implying ‚Äúcomplete awe of God\\". Straight after this Abraham purchased the Cave of Machpela in Hebron from Ephron the Hittite who made a treaty with Abraham that his descendants would not take the city of Jerusalem away from the Hittites by force. As a result, the western part of the city was eventually purchased from Ephron‚Äôs descendants by the Israelites. In the Hebrew Bible Although Jerusalem () appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times, it is not explicitly mentioned in the Pentateuch. Instead when referring to Jerusalem, the placenames Salem and Moriah , and the term \\"the place that God will choose\\" are used: > You shall seek the place where the Lord your God chooses, out of all your > tribes, to put His name for His dwelling place.Deuteronomy 12:5 Maimonides cites various reasons why this is so, the first being that if the nations of the world had learned that this place was destined to become the centre of the highest religious ideals they would have occupied it to prevent the Jews from ever controlling it. In Hebrew, the first four letters of Jerusalem spell YeRuSha (which means inheritance). In Judaism it is considered the Written Law, the basis for the Oral Law (Mishnah, Talmud and Shulkhan Arukh) studied, practiced and treasured by Jews and Judaism for three millennia (list of Jewish prayers and blessings). The Talmud elaborates in great depth the Jewish connection with the city. For example, the book of Psalms, which has been frequently recited and memorized by Jews for centuries, says: > * \\"By the rivers of Babylon we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion.\\" > (Psalms 137:1) * \\"For there they that carried us away captive required of us > a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of > the songs of Zion. How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land? If I > forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning .

The Sanhedrin, which governed the nation, was located in the Temple precincts. The Temple service was at the heart of the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur proceedings. The Temple was central to the Three pilgrim festivals, namely Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot, when all Jews were incumbent to gather in Jerusalem. Every seven years all Jews were required to assemble at the Temple for the Hakhel reading. The forty-nine-day Counting of the Omer recalls the Omer offering which was offered at the Temple every day between Passover and Shavuot. The eight-day festival of Hanukkah celebrates the rededication of the Second Temple after its desecration by Antiochus IV. A number of fast days including the Ninth of Av, the Tenth of Tevet and the Seventeenth of Tammuz, all recall the destruction of the Temple. Maimonides records a list of bylaws which applied to Jerusalem during the Temple period: A corpse must not be left within the city overnight; human remains must not be brought inside the city; its houses are not to be rented out; residence for a ger toshav was not granted; burial plots are not maintained, other than those of the House of David and Huldah which existed from ancient times; the planting of gardens and orchards is forbidden; sowing and plowing is forbidden due to the possibility of decaying produce; trees are not planted, except for rose gardens which existed in ancient times; garbage heaps are forbidden due to infestation; girders and balconies may not overhang the public domain; pressure ovens are forbidden due to the smoke; it is forbidden to raise chickens. In commemoration At the conclusion of the Yom Kippur service and the Passover Seder outside of Jerusalem the words \\"Next Year in Jerusalem\\" are recited. When consoling a mourner, Jews recite \\"May God comfort you among all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem\\". In Jerusalem itself, the Passover Seder might conclude, \\"Next Year in Jerusalem, the rebuilt,\\" referring likely to the Temple that was destroyed over two millennia ago. In prayer In Judaism, the daily prayers contain numerous references to Jerusalem. The amidah prayer, which is recited three times on regular weekdays, must be said facing towards Jerusalem. The following supplication is contained in it: > \\"And to Jerusalem, Your city, may You return in compassion, and may You rest > within it, as You have spoke. May You rebuild it soon in our days as an > eternal structure, and may You speedily establish the throne of King David > within it. Blessed are You, God, the builder of Jerusalem...May our eyes > behold Your return to Zion in compassion. Blessed are you God, who restores > His presence to Zion\\". In the Grace After Meals which is recited after partaking of a meal eaten with bread, the following is said: > \\"Have mercy Lord, our God...on Jerusalem Your city, on Zion the resting > place of Your glory, on the monarchy of King David Your anointed, and on the > great and holy Temple upon which Your name is called...Rebuild Jerusalem, > the holy city, soon in our days. Blessed are you God who rebuilds Jerusalem > in His mercy, amen\\". After partaking of a light meal, the thanksgiving blessing states: > \\"Have mercy, Lord, our God...on Jerusalem, Your city; and on Zion, the > resting place of Your glory; upon Your altar, and upon Your Temple. Rebuild > Jerusalem, the city of holiness, speedily in our days. Bring us up into it > and gladden us in its rebuilding and let us eat from its fruit and be > satisfied with its goodness and bless You upon it in holiness and purity.‚Äù Customs in remembrance of Jerusalem Some Jewish groups observe several customs in remembrance of Jerusalem. A tiny amount of ash is touched to the forehead of a Jewish groom before he goes to stand beneath the bridal canopy. This symbolically reminds him not to allow his own rejoicing to be \\"greater\\" than the ongoing need to recall Jerusalem's destruction. The well-known custom of the groom breaking a glass with the heel of his shoe after the wedding ceremony is also related to the subject of mourning for Jerusalem. It is a custom for some that the groom recites the sentence from Psalms, \\"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget [her cunning].\\" (Psalms 137:5). Another ancient custom is to leave a patch of interior wall opposite the door to one's home unpainted, as a remembrance of the destruction (zecher lechurban), of the Temples and city of Jerusalem. According to Jewish law, as an expression of mourning for Jerusalem, it is forbidden to listen to any form of music, other than on holidays and at celebrations such as weddings and inaugurations of new Torah scrolls. This prohibition, however, while codified in the Shulchan Aruch, is not followed by the vast majority of Orthodox and even Haredi Jews nowadays. Western Wall in Jerusalem Orthodox Jewish women praying in Jerusalem's Western Wall tunnel at the closest physical point to the Holy of Holies. The Western Wall (kotel hama'aravi), in the heart of the Old City of Jerusalem, is one of the holiest sites in modern Judaism. This is because it is the closest point to the original site of the Holy of Holies which is currently inaccessible to Jews. Until 1967, it was generally considered to be the only surviving remnant of the Second Temple from the era of the Roman conquests; there are said to be esoteric texts in Midrash that mention God's promise to keep this one remnant of the outer temple wall standing as a memorial and reminder of the past. Hence also the name \\"Wailing Wall\\", used by non-Jews because many Jews would traditionally cry when they came before it. However, the capture of Eastern Jerusalem in the Six-Day War revealed that the retaining wall of the Temple Mount in fact survived in all places. Celebration of Bar Mitzvah in the Western Wall tunnel in Jerusalem. Rabbis and Jerusalem The Talmud records that the rabbinical leader Yohanan ben Zakkai (c. 70 C.E.) urged a peaceful surrender, in order to save Jerusalem from destruction, but was not heeded as the city was under the control of the Zealots. An early expression of the Jewish desire to \\"return to Zion\\" is the journey of Yehuda Halevi, who died in about 1140. Jewish legend relates that as he came near Jerusalem, overpowered by the sight of the Holy City, he sang his most beautiful elegy, the celebrated \\"Zionide\\" Tzion ha-lo Tish'ali and that at that instant he was ridden down and killed by an Arab. He was followed by Nahmanides (Ramban) who, in 1267 emigrated to the land of Israel, and came for a short stay to live in Jerusalem. He wrote that he found barely ten Jews, as it had been desolated by the Crusades, nevertheless, together they built a synagogue that is the oldest that still stands to this day, known as the Ramban Synagogue. In the 18th century, both the Vilna Gaon and Baal Shem Tov instructed and sent small successive waves of their disciples to settle in Jerusalem, then under Turkish Ottoman rule. They created a Jewish religious infrastructure that remains the core of the Haredi Jewish community in Jerusalem to this day, currently led by the Edah HaChareidis. Some of the descendants of the Vilna Gaon's students established the extremely anti- Zionist Neturei Karta movement. Creation of the State of Israel The British Mandate of Palestine authorities created the new offices of \\"Chief Rabbi\\" in 1921 for both Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardic Jews with central offices in Jerusalem. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (d. 1935) moved to Jerusalem to set up this office, associated with the \\"Religious Zionist\\" Mafdal group, becoming the first modern Chief Rabbi together with Sephardic Chief Rabbi Yaakov Meir. The official structure housing the Chief Rabbinate was completed in 1958 and is known as Heichal Shlomo. In contrast, the Haredi Jews of Jerusalem formed the anti-Zionist Edah HaChareidis, an umbrella organization for all Haredi Jews, who were not Zionists and fiercely opposed the activities of the (Religious) Zionist movement. The first Chief Rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis was Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld. Several groups formerly aligned with the Edah gradually broke away from it; these include the Hasidic movements Belz and Skver. The Hasidic group Ger was never part of the Edah. Aside from the more famous Ashkenazi Edah, there is also a lesser known Sephardi Edah HaChareidit. Jerusalem is also home to a number of the world's largest yeshivot (Talmudical and Rabbinical schools), and has become the undisputed capital of Jewish scholarly, religious and spiritual life for most of world Jewry. Examples of major yeshivos in Jerusalem are the Mir yeshiva and the Brisk yeshiva. Major Hasidic dynasties headquartered in Jerusalem include Toldos Aharon, Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok, Dushinsky, Ger, Belz, Breslov, Karlin- Stolin, and Rachmastrivka. Most of these groups have a membership ranging from circa one thousand to tens of thousands. There are also several smaller groups, not mentioned here. (See also: :Hasidic dynasties headquartered in Jerusalem.) Jerusalem in modern Israel Jerusalem in the 21st century is perceived by Israeli Jews in different ways, depending on their religious beliefs. In the summer of 2009, riots by Haredi Jews broke out in Jerusalem over the opening of a parking lot near the Old City on Saturdays. However, secular groups counter-protested, claiming that Jerusalem should be a city for all people, religious and non-religious. The call for an \\"open\\" Jerusalem has received support from Rabbi Dr. Donniel Hartman an Orthodox Rabbi and President of the Shalom Hartman Institute, in Jerusalem. He wrote: \\"As a religious Jew who is also a Zionist I believe Jerusalem is not simply important as the city of God, but as the capital of the State of Israel, a state which, as distinct from you, I value as a part of my religious life. As a committed Zionist, I believe the citizens of our country need unifying symbols around which to construct our shared collective life. Jerusalem, one of the few remaining unifying concepts in our deeply divided Jewish world, may serve as precisely such as symbol. The meaning of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is that it is a city which belongs to all citizens of the State of Israel. While you and I may observe Shabbat in similar ways, my fellow citizens of Israel observe it very differently. While you want to preserve the city, I want to preserve our people\\".

The Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of the Divine Saviour have rendered Jerusalem -- which was already glorious -- the most celebrated city in all the world. The enthusiasm with which, after the Day of Pentecost, thousands of Jews declared themselves disciples of Jesus Christ provoked a violent persecution of Christians, in which the deacon Stephen was the first martyr (Acts 6: 8‚Äì15).\\" New Testament According to the New Testament, Jerusalem was the city to which Jesus was brought as a child, to be presented at the Temple () and to attend festivals (). According to the canonical gospels, Jesus preached and healed in Jerusalem, especially in the Temple Courts. The events of Pentecost in the New Testament Book of Acts also took place at this location. There is also an account of Jesus' cleansing of the Temple at the Temple Court, chasing various traders out of the sacred precincts (Mark , see also Mark 11). At the end of each of the gospels, there are accounts of Jesus' Last Supper in an \\"Upper Room\\" in Jerusalem, his arrest in Gethsemane, his trial, his crucifixion at Golgotha, his burial nearby, his resurrection and ascension, and his prophecy to return. The Acts of the Apostles and Pauline epistles show James the Just, the brother of Jesus, as leader of the early Jerusalem church. He and his successors were the focus for Jewish Christians until the destruction of the city by Emperor Hadrian in 135.See: Jonathan Bourgel, \\"'If I forget you, Jerusalem...': The Jewish Christians' Relationship to the Destroyed Temple Following the Great Revolt\\", in: From One Identity to Another: The Mother Church of Jerusalem Between the Two Jewish Revolts Against Rome (66-135/6 EC), Paris: √âditions du Cerf, collection Juda√Øsme ancien et Christianisme primitive, (French), pp. 49-79. The Cenacle on Mount Zion, claimed to be the location of the Last Supper and Pentecost. Bargil PixnerBargil Pixner, The Church of the Apostles found on Mount Zion, Biblical Archaeology Review 16.3 May/June 1990 claims the original Church of the Apostles is located under the current structure. Christian tradition holds that the place of the Last Supper is the Cenacle, on the second floor of a building on Mount Zion where David's Tomb is reportedly on the first floor. Biblical archaeologist Bargil Pixner claims to have found three walls of the original structure still extant today. The place of Jesus' anguished prayer and betrayal, Gethsemane, is probably somewhere near the Church of All Nations on the Mount of Olives. Jesus' trial before Pontius Pilate may have taken place at the Antonia Fortress, to the north of the Temple area. Popularly, the exterior pavement where the trial was conducted is beneath the Convent of the Sisters of Zion. Other Christians believe that Pilate tried Jesus at Herod's Palace on Mount Zion. The Via Dolorosa, or way of suffering, is the traditional route to Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, and is an important pilgrimage. The route ends at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (perhaps the most holy place for Christians). The Holy Sepulchre is traditionally believed to be the location of Golgotha and Jesus' nearby tomb. The original church was built in 336 by Constantine I. The Garden Tomb is a popular pilgrimage site near the Damascus Gate. It was suggested by Charles George Gordon that this site, rather than the Holy Sepulchre, is the true place of Golgotha. Jerusalem historian Dan Mazar reported in a series of articles in the Jerusalem Christian Review on the archaeological discoveries made at this location by his grandfather, Professor Benjamin Mazar, which included the 1st-century stairs of ascent, where Jesus and his disciples preached, as well as the mikvaot used by both Jewish and Christian pilgrims. Much of this area was also uncovered by the excavations conducted by the elder Mazar.  Early Christianity  The Church of All Nations near the Mount of Olives. Main entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The exclusion of Jews from the new city of Aelia Capitolina meant that gentile bishops were appointed under the authority of the Metropolitans of Caesarea and, ultimately, the Patriarchs of Antioch. The general significance of Jerusalem to Christians outside the Holy Land entered a period of decline during the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire but resumed again c.325 when Emperor Constantine I and his mother, Helena, endowed Jerusalem with churches and shrines, making it the foremost centre of Christian pilgrimage, see also Constantine I and Christianity. Helena is remembered as the patron saint of archaeologists and (according to the church historian Socrates of ConstantinopleSocrates' Church History at CCEL.org: Book I, Chapter XVII: The Emperor‚Äôs Mother Helena having come to Jerusalem, searches for and finds the Cross of Christ, and builds a Church.) claimed to have found (with the assistance of Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem) the True Cross, after removing a temple to Venus that had been built over the site. Jerusalem received special recognition in Canon VII of Nicaea in 325, without yet becoming a metropolitan see.Schaff's Seven Ecumenical Councils: First Nicaea: Canon VII: \\"Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed that the Bishop of Aelia [i.e., Jerusalem] should be honoured, let him, saving its due dignity to the Metropolis, have the next place of honour.\\"; \\"It is very hard to determine just what was the \\"precedence\\" granted to the Bishop of Aelia, nor is it clear which is the metropolis referred to in the last clause. Most writers, including Hefele, Balsamon, Aristenus and Beveridge consider it to be C√¶sarea; while Zonaras thinks Jerusalem to be intended, a view recently adopted and defended by Fuchs; others again suppose it is Antioch that is referred to.\\" The traditional founding date for the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre (which guards the Christian holy places in the Holy Land) is 313 which corresponds with the date of the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire. The Council of Chalcedon in 451 raised the Bishop of Jerusalem to the rank of patriarch, together with Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria and Antioch. However, Byzantine politics meant that Jerusalem simply passed from the Syrian jurisdiction of Antioch to the Greek authorities in Constantinople. For centuries, Greek clergy dominated the Jerusalem church. Meanwhile, the Roman church never accepted the Pentarchy and instead claimed primacy, see Papal supremacy and East‚ÄìWest Schism. On the other hand, ancient notion of the primacy of the Church of Jerusalem was preserved in several texts, like the early medieval list known as the \\"Limits of the Five Patriarchates\\" (). Medieval traditions=Muslim conquest of the Levant In 638, Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, handed over the keys of the city to Caliph Umar's Muslim forces. The Muslim authorities in Jerusalem were not kind to their Christian subjects, forcing them to live a life of \\"discrimination, servitude and humiliation\\".Prawer, Joshua. \\"The Settlement of the Latins in Jerusalem,\\" Speculum 27.4 (1952): 491. First Crusade The mistreatment of Christians would only worsen as the armies of the First Crusade approached Jerusalem. Fearing that the Eastern Christians had been conspiring with approaching crusaders, the Muslim authorities of Jerusalem massacred much of the city's Christian population, seeing the fortunate escape the city in terror.Prawer, Joshua. \\"The Settlement of the Latins in Jerusalem,\\" Speculum 27.4 (1952): 492. While the Crusaders hoped to protect Christian pilgrims who had been attacked and killed by the Turks, to protect the Christian holy places which had been destroyed by Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and in fact were coming in response to pleas for help from the Eastern Christian Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, there is no evidence for any conspiracy. On 15 July 1099, the army of the First Crusade captured Jerusalem. Most the city's population was killed, with the exception of Eastern Christians. They were, however, exiled from the city, as their new Latin rulers believed they were conspiring with the Muslims.Prawer, Joshua. \\"The Settlement of the Latins in Jerusalem,\\" Speculum 27.4 (1952): 493. Jerusalem became the capital of a 'Latin Kingdom' with a Latin church and a Latin Patriarch, all under the authority of the Pope. The city's first Latin ruler, Godfrey of Bouillon, was elected in 1099.Riley-Smith, Jonathan. \\"The Motives of the Earliest Crusaders and the Settlement of Latin Palestine.\\" The English Historical Review 98.398 (1983): 724. Out of humility and deference to Jesus, he refused to be called king in a city where he thought only Jesus had the right to be called king; he would only call himself Jerusalem's protector. Throughout his short reign as protector, Godfrey struggled to increase the population of Jerusalem until his death in 1100. In 1100 he was succeeded by his brother Baldwin I who, unlike Godfrey, was willing to take the title of King of Jerusalem. With Jerusalem's population dwindling Baldwin I, as early as 1115, offered the Christians of Transjordan a section of Jerusalem. These Christians were often the target of Muslim aggression and therefore promptly accepted Baldwin's proposal.Prawer, Joshua. \\"The Settlement of the Latins in Jerusalem,\\" Speculum 27.4 (1952): 496. In 1187, when Saladin captured the city, the Holy Sepulchre and many other churches were returned to the care of Eastern Christians. Early modern and modern From the 17th to the 19th century, various Catholic European nations petitioned the Ottoman Empire for Catholic control of the 'holy places'. The Franciscans are the traditional Catholic custodians of the holy places. Control swung back and forth between the western and eastern churches throughout this period. Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I (1839‚Äì1861), perhaps out of despair, published a firman that laid out in detail the exact rights and responsibility of each community at the Holy Sepulchre. This document became known as the Status Quo, and is still the basis for the complex protocol of the shrine. The Status Quo was upheld by the British Mandate and Jordan. After the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and the passing of the Old City into Israeli hands, the Knesset passed a law protecting the holy places. Five Christian communities currently have rights in the Holy Sepulchre: the Greek Patriarchate, Latins (Western Rite Roman Catholics), Armenians, Copts and Syriac Orthodox. Jerusalem as an allegory for the Church In Christianity, Jerusalem is sometimes interpreted as an allegory or type for the Church of Christ. There is a vast apocalyptic tradition that focuses on the heavenly Jerusalem instead of the literal and historical city of Jerusalem. This view is notably advocated in Augustine's City of God, a popular 5th-century Christian book that was written during the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

Originally expected to cost AUD2 billion), the CBD Metro was later estimated to cost $7 billion and caused Campbell to come under pressure from the public over the continued viability of the project. The Sydney Metro was cancelled in February 2010. Campbell was labelled 'Mr Slow' by the NSW opposition and the Daily Telegraph for his handling of transport issues. Resignation On 20 May 2010, Seven News broadcast video surveillance revealing Campbell leaving a gay sex club in Kensington. Shortly before the footage was aired, Campbell resigned as minister for Transport and Roads citing personal reasons and said that he would remain as the Member for Keira. The journalist who broke the story, Adam Walters, defended airing the footage, saying it was in the \\"public interest\\". Walters was supported by former Labor Premier Barrie Unsworth, who described Campbell's actions as \\"deplorable.\\" Mr Unsworth told The Australian newspaper \\"Campbell has been the police minister and he's been on the NSW Crime Commission, and he's frequented places where he's easily recognised. The threat is not from Channel 7 lurking outside but by the people inside. We've got a criminal milieu in this city and he laid himself open to all sorts of threats and blackmail.\\" Another former Labor Premier Bob Carr defended Campbell. \\"My position has always been that the private life of MPs is precisely that,\\" Mr Carr said. Others, including the former High Court justice Michael Kirby, criticised Walters and Seven, with Kirby describing Seven News as \\"serial homophobes\\" for their coverage of the story. On 28 September 2010, Campbell announced that he would not seek Labor Party endorsement, nor re-election, for the seat of Keira at the 2011 general election. It was reported that Campbell claimed he had strong support from the Labor Party and was confident he would have been endorsed for his seat should he have decided to contest the election. Campbell retired after serving 24 years as an elected representative in local and state politics.

He played 13 seasons as a defensive end and defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the Detroit Lions from 1965 to 1977. He was selected as the Lions' most valuable player in 1972 and was also selected as a second-team All-NFL player that year. At the time of his retirement, Hand's 164 games with the Lions ranked fourth in franchise history. A native of Paterson, New Jersey, he played college football for the Appalachian State Mountaineers football team and was selected as a first-team NAIA All-American in 1964. He is one of only four Appalachian State football players to have had his jersey number (71) retired. Early years Hand was born in 1940 in Paterson, New Jersey, grew up in West Milford, New Jersey, and attended Butler High School.Presinzano, Jessica. \\"Celebrities, politicians and athletes who call North Jersey home\\", The Record (Bergen County), October 11, 2017. Accessed November 18, 2017. \\"Larry Hand, formerly of the Detroit Lions was born in Paterson, but grew up in West Milford.\\" When he began high school, he was five feet, six inches tall, and weighed 135 pounds. He did not play varsity football until his senior year and, even then, was not a starter. After graduating from high school, Hand took a job working as a mason in Butler. College football Hand grew to be six feet, four inches tall, and 215 pounds, and enrolled at Appalachian State Teachers College in Boone, North Carolina. He began playing college football for the Appalachian State Mountaineers football team in 1962 at age 22 under head coach Jim Duncan. At the end of his junior year in 1963, he was unanimously selected as a first- team tackle on the All-Carolinas Conference football team. He was also selected as the outstanding lineman in the conference. After his senior year, he was selected as the most valuable player in the Carolinas Conference. He was also named to the NAIA All-America team, and was the only player selected as a first-team player on both the offensive and defensive units of the NAIA District 26 team -- he was picked as a tackle on offense and an interior lineman on defense. His #71 jersey was later retired by Appalachian State, one of only four Appalachian State jerseys to be retired. Professional football In December 1963, the Detroit Lions selected Hand as a \\"future selection\\" in the 10th round of the 1964 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 1965, Hand share responsibility at the right defensive end position with Sam Williams. He appeared in all 14 games at defensive end for the Lions in the 1965, 1966, and 1967 seasons. On October 1, 1967, he scored his first NFL touchdown on an interception against Cardinals' quarterback Jim Hart. He had a total of two interceptions for touchdowns during the 1967 season. In September 1968, Hand sustained torn ligaments to his knee in the season opener, underwent surgery, and missed the remainder of the 1968 season. In 1969, he held out for the first two weeks of training camp, but re-signed with the Lions in late July. Hand returned to his position as the Lions' right defensive end, starting all 14 games during the 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973 seasons. He had a 62-yard interception return for touchdown in 1970 and was selected as the defensive most valuable player for the 1972 Lions. In 1973, Hand again held out during the early weeks of training camp, finally signing a contract in early August. In 1974, Hand appeared in 13 games at defensive end for the Lions, eight as a starter. In 1975, the Lions moved Hand from his regular spot at right defensive end to right defensive tackle. He started all 14 games for the Lions at that position during the 1975 season and 10 more in 1976. In May 1975, he was honored with a ceremony in his hometown of Butler, New Jersey, in which he was presented with the key to the city. On November 14, 1976, in the 10th game of the season, Hand injured his knee against the New Orleans Saints and missed the remainder of the season. In April 1977, Hand tested the waters as a free agent and received an offer from the Houston Oilers. The Lions matched the Oilers' offer, and Hand returned to the Lions. He appeared in all 14 games for the Lions in 1977, but was not a starter. In August 1978, the Lions placed Hand on waivers, ending his NFL career. At the time of his retirement, Hand's 164 games with the Lions ranked fourth in franchise history behind Wayne Walker, Dick LeBeau, and Darris McCord. Later years In the early 1980s, Hand moved to the Winston-Salem area in North Carolina. He worked for many years as a stock broker and lived in the Winston-Salem area with his wife, Darlene.

Her notable works include Empire of Dreams (1988), Yo- Yo Boing! (1998) and United States of Banana (2011). Braschi writes cross- genre literature and political philosophy in Spanish, Spanglish, and English. Her work is a hybrid of poetry, fiction, theatre, memoire, manifesto, and philosophy. Her writings explore the enculturation journey of Hispanic immigrants, and dramatize the three main political options of Puerto Rico: independence, colony, and state.Aldama, Frederick, and Christopher Gonz√°lez. Latinx Studies: The Key Concepts. Routledge, 2018. Early life in Puerto Rico Giannina Braschi was born to an upper-class family in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In her teen years, she was a founding member of the San Juan Children's Choir, a fashion model, and a tennis champion. Her father Euripides (\\"Pilo\\") Braschi was also a tennis champion.  Studying abroad in Spain  In the 1970s, Braschi studied literature and philosophy in Madrid, Rome, Rouen, and London, before she settled in New York City. She credited her start in poetry to the older Spanish poets who mentored her when she lived in Madrid: Claudio Rodr√≠guez, Carlos Bouso√±o, Vicente Alexandre, and Blas de Otero. Academic career With a PhD in Hispanic Literatures from State University of New York, Stony Brook (1980), Braschi was a professor at Rutgers University, City University of New York, and Colgate University. Braschi has received awards and fellowships from institutions including Ford Foundation, Danforth Scholarship, National Endowment for the Arts, New York Foundation for the Arts, Rutgers University, and PEN, among others. She published a book on the poetry of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer and essays on Cervantes, Garcilaso, C√©sar Vallejo, Juan Ramon Jimenez and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Literary career Braschi's work is situated in the Latinx avant-garde, a \\"burgeoning body of work that testifies to Latinx writers‚Äô abiding interest in the avant-garde as a means for engaging ideas of material, social relevance\\". Her writings are also placed within the fields of Postcolonial, Postmodern, and Nuyorican literatures, as well as Latinx political philosophy. Braschi is considered a \\"revolutionary voice\\"in contemporary Latin American literature\\".  Spanish: El Imperio de los sue√±os  In the 1980s, Braschi wrote dramatic poetry in Spanish prose in New York City. Her postmodern poetry titles were published in Barcelona, Spain, including: Asalto al tiempo (Assault on Time, 1980), La Comedia profana (Profane Comedy, 1985), and El Imperio de los sue√±os (Empire of Dreams, 1988). She was part of the Nuyorican movement. New York City is the site and subject of much of her poetry. In a climactic episode of Braschi's Empire of Dreams, \\"Pastoral or the Inquisition of Memories\\", shepherds invade 5th Avenue during the Puerto Rican Day Parade and take over the City of New York; the shepherds ring the bells of St. Patrick's Cathedral, and seize the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Immigrant characters play the role of other characters, swapping names, genders, personal histories, and identities. Alicia Ostriker situates her gender-bending and genre-blending poetry as having a \\"sheer erotic energy that defies definition and dogma.\\"Introduction to Giannina Braschi's Empire of Dreams, Alicia Ostriker, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994  Spanglish: Yo-Yo Boing!  She published the first full-length Spanglish novel Yo-Yo Boing! in 1998. Yo-Yo Boing! explores \\"the lived experiences of urban life for Hispanics, as in the case with New York City, and her principal interest is in representing how individuals move in and out of different cultural coordinates, including one so crucial as language.\\"Spanglish.Lengua Fresca, co-edited by Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum The book was written in an era of renewed calls for English- only laws, ethnic cleansing campaigns, and corporate censorship.Introduction to Giannina Braschi's Yo-Yo Boing!, Doris Sommer, Harvard University, 1998. \\"For decades, Dominican and Puerto Rican authors have carried out a linguistic revolution\\", noted The Boston Globe, \\"and Giannina Braschi, especially in her novel Yo-Yo Boing!, testify to it\\".The Boston Globe, \\"Spanglish is everywhere now, which is no problema for some, but a pain in the cuello for purists\\", by Ilan Stavans, 14 September 2003.

It is a postmodern cross-genre work that opens with the collapse of the World Trade Center on 9/11. The work is a scathing critique of 21st-century capitalism and the global war on terror. Subjects include immigration, mass incarceration, financial terrorism, colonial debt structures, and \\"power imbalances within the Americas.\\" The work is celebratory of foreign influences.Braschi, Giannina, \\"What to Read Now: Mixed- Genre Literature\\", World Literature Today, September‚ÄìOctober 2012 Braschi stated in Evergreen Review that she considered herself \\"more French than Beckett, Picasso and Gertrude Stein\\", and identifies as the \\"granddaughter of Alfred Jarry and Antonin Artaud, bastard child of Samuel Beckett and James Joyce, half-sister to Heiner M√ºller, kissing cousin of Tadeusz Kantor, and lover of Witkiewicz\\".The Evergreen Review's 50th Anniversary Edition, (www.evergreenreview.com), Giannina Braschi, 2007.

Political activism Braschi is an advocate for Puerto Rican independence. She declared the independence of Puerto Rico in United States of Banana and stated in the press that \\"Liberty is not an option ‚Äî it is a human right.\\" In the 1990s, she protested the United States Navy's bombing exercises in Vieques, along with politicians Rub√©n Berr√≠os and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., singers Danny Rivera and Willie Col√≥n, and fellow authors Ana Lydia Vega and Rigoberta Mench√∫. Braschi spoke on a panel on \\"The New Censorship\\" at the PEN 2012 World Voices Festival where she offered \\"a critique of 21st century capitalism in which [she] condemned corporate censorship and control.\\" In July 2019, Braschi led early marches outside La Fortaleza in Old San Juan to demand the resignation of Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello, and joined massive protests, with singers Bad Bunny, Residente, and Ricky Martin, that led to the Governor's resignation.

When they met, Mary worked at the Commerce Department and later was employed as a 4th grade teacher. David and Mary had two children: a daughter Susan, and a son Peter. The Bells and their children traveled extensively in all parts of the world, and lived in several locations, including New York City, Boston, MA, Washington D.C., and Karachi, Pakistan. He continued to travel the world with his wife up until the time of his death. Military service Bell joined the United States Marine Corps in December, 1942. He was trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, Camp Pendleton, California, and Quantico, Virginia, where he was an instructor. He served on land in Pearl Harbor from July 1945 until he was released from active duty on 21 September of the same year, at which point he was a First Lieutenant. He was promoted to the rank of Captain on 19 July 1948 and was honorably discharged on December 16, 1957. Government service In 1942, he became a staff member at the Bureau of the Budget. During World War II (1942 to 1945) he served in the Marine Corps. From 1947 to 1951, Bell alternated between a position on the staff at the Bureau of the Budget, and a position as a special assistant to President Harry S. Truman. In 1951, Bell became Administrative Executive to the President. In these positions Bell worked on the formulation and evaluation of the administration's economic policies and programs. During this time, Bell also worked as a speech writer for President Truman. President Kennedy with a picture of Bell In 1952, Bell left Washington temporarily to join the campaign staff of the Democratic nominee for president, Adlai Stevenson. Bell served Stevenson as a speech writer and as Stevenson's White House liaison. When the Truman administration ended in January 1953, Bell returned to private life. At the end of 1960, President-elect Kennedy asked Bell to become the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. Bell accepted, and was immediately put to work during the Eisenhower/Kennedy transition helping to formulate the new administration's economic policy. Some of Bell's other tasks were to map out legislative proposals and strategy, and to review the proposals made by other government agencies. At the end of 1962, President Kennedy asked Bell to become the new Administrator of the Agency for International Development, created in response to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. In this post Bell worked at developing foreign aid programs and legislation and appealing for funds and fighting budget cutbacks. Ford Foundation work Bell left the government in the summer of 1966, and became Executive Vice President of the Ford Foundation, a private independent institution dedicated to advancing social justice in the US and in developing nations. During his time at the Ford Foundation, Bell was a member of a large number of advisory committees dealing with foreign aid and government reorganization. He left the Ford Foundation in 1980. Death David Bell died of leukemia on September 6, 2000, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the age of 81. He was survived by his two children, seven grandchildren, and four great- grandchildren. Bell was notably tall and thin, and had an avid interest in arts and crafts. His home was filled with items he and his wife collected on their many trips abroad. Both Bell and his wife loved jazz and had friends in the arts. They were socially progressive for their time, strongly opposed segregation and sent their children to integrated schools.

It was built in 1892 for workers working at the Cabot Mill in Brunswick. Description The bridge has two steel A-frame towers, each in height, mounted on concrete abutments. Cables are suspended from the tower, supporting a wooden plank deck suspended from the cable by metal rods, and railings high. The span across the river between the towers is , and the distance between the cable anchor points is . The cable is in diameter, with seven wires each composed of seven strands. History The bridge was constructed by John A. Roebling's Sons Company, the engineering firm that designed and built the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City and other bridges around the world. The bridge's history is closely tied to the French Canadian heritage of Topsham and Brunswick. In the early 1900s, the present steel towers replaced the original timber-framed towers. A flood destroyed the superstructure of the bridge in 1936 and it was rebuilt in 1938 by the Works Progress Administration. The current cables are original to the bridge's construction. The towns of Brunswick and Topsham created a joint committee to repair the bridge in 2000. The bridge renovation was completed in December 2006. Public parks on each side of the bridge were completed in summer 2007. A reopening and dedication ceremony was held on September 8, 2007, with two of John A. Roebling's great-great-great granddaughters in attendance. The Swinging Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in January 2004. It was dedicated as a Maine Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in May 2011 by the Maine Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers. The bridge is set to be a part of the new fully accessible Androscoggin Riverwalk currently being designed.

Surveillance in the Stacks: The FBI's Library Awareness Program. New York: Greenwood Press, 1991. The Library Awareness Program was designed as a counterintelligence effort that would provide information to the FBI including the names and reading habits of users of many different libraries. The FBI was particularly interested in learning this type of information about foreign diplomats or their agents. It is clear that librarians and the public were unaware of this program until its existence was made public in an article published September 18, 1987 in the New York Times.McFadden, Robert D. FBI in New York Asks Librarians' Aid In Reporting on Spies. New York Times, September 18, 1987, sec. A, p. 1. The FBI claimed that one of the major reasons this program was initiated was because hostile intelligence agents had been able to find some information that could be dangerous to the security of the United States. The area of greatest concern was the information at academic libraries that could be accessed through sophisticated databanks used for research. This point was illuminated by the report that a Soviet employee of the United Nations had been able to recruit a college student from Queens to obtain information at the library that was described as sensitive. The Libraries in New York City that had been the subjects of the FBI visits contacted the New York Library Association about what had happened, they in turn contacted the American Library Association. This led to the opposition of the program by the NYLA, a long time New York Congressman, and the ALA and resulted in widespread outrage within the field. In October 1987 the ALA's Intellectual Freedom Committee released a statement that explained the threat of this program, and urged libraries not to violate their ethical obligation to protect patrons' rights by providing information to the FBI. In 1988 congressional hearings were conducted on the subject. The purpose of these hearings may have been to find out what the FBI had been up to in regards to the Library Awareness Program, and if it was lawful. Following these hearings several FOIA requests were submitted to obtain more information on the subject. Eventually the FBI complied with one of the requests and released 37 pages of information about FBI activities related to the program. Through this release it was learned that the actual program name may have been Development of Counterintelligence Among Librarians, or DECAL. After the congressional hearings in 1988, many institutions decided to adopt formal policies about what to do in the event that the FBI contacted the library. Most libraries have policies in case of such an event today. Librarians have tried to make it clear that they were not against helping the FBI in general, but rather that they opposed violating the rights of their patrons. Since that time many librarians have helped the FBI in a variety of projects that did not encroach on the patron's rights. The issue has gathered a renewed concern since \\"9-11\\", and the \\"Patriot Act\\". Some people believe that the Patriot Act grants the government the right to inspect patron records without due cause in much the same way as the Library Awareness Program. Today, many library patrons complain about the difference between passive surveillance of a patron's information and the FBI's active role in censoring online information and the free access to information.https://www.propublica.org/article/library-support-anonymous- internet-browsing-effort-stops-after-dhs-email Selected bibliography * Foerstel, Herbert N.

The down train (northbound) left London at 16:00 and arrived in Edinburgh at 22:00; the up train (southbound) ran half an hour later. The design was based on the very successful streamlined train, The Silver Jubilee, built in 1935, but instead of being painted silver it was given a two-tone blue livery.

Painting in Karnataka has a long and illustrious history, tracing its origins back to the jAjanta times (2nd century B.C. to 7th century A.D.) The distinct school of Mysore painting evolved from the paintings of Vijayanagar times during the reign of the Vijayanagar Kings (1336-1565 AD) The rulers of Vijayanagar and their feudatories encouraged literature, art, architecture, religious and philosophical discussions. With the fall of the Vijayanagar empire after the Battle of Talikota the artists who were till then under royal patronage migrated to various other places like Mysore, Tanjore, Surpur, etc. Absorbing the local artistic traditions and customs, the erstwhile Vijayanagar School of Painting gradually evolved into the many styles of painting in South India, including the Mysore and Tanjore schools of painting. Mysore paintings are known for their elegance, muted colours, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are Hindu gods and goddesses and scenes from Hindu mythology.http://wiki.indianfolklore.org/images/d/d3/Mysore.pdf History Painted ceiling, Virupaksha temple, Hampi, 15th century The fall of the Vijayanagar Empire in 1565 AD and the sack of Hampi in the Battle of Talikota resulted initially in distress for scores of families of painters who had been dependent on the patronage of the empire. As Dr. Charita point out these families of artists called Chitrakaras migrated to various pockets who were feudatories of Vijayanagara Empire. As scholar A.L.Narasimhan traces some of these surviving paintings are witnessed at Shravanabelagola, Sira, Keregoodirangapura, Srirangapattana, Nippani, Sibi, Naragunda, Bettadapura, Hardanahalli, Mudukutore, Mysore, Chitradurga, Kollegala, Raichur, Hiriyur, Benakanakere, Anegundi, Yalladahalli, Lepakshi and many other places located in Karanataka. Raja Wodeyar I (1578‚Äì1617 A.D) provided a vital service to the cause of painting by rehabilitating several families of painters of the Vijayanagara School at Srirangapatna. The successors of Raja Wodeyar continued to patronize the art of painting by commissioning the temples and palaces to be painted with mythological scenes. However none of these paintings have survived due to the ravages of war between the British on the one side and Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan on the other. Hyder and Tippu who bested the Wodeyars took over the reins of Mysore for a brief period. However, the artists (Chitragars) continued to be patronised and flourished under the reign of Tipu and Hyder too. The Narasimha swamy temple in Seebi on the highway between Tumkur and Sira was built by Nallappa who was in the service of both Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan, during Tipu's reign and has several wonderful wall frescoes in the Vijayanagar style which gradually evolved into the Mysore and Tanjore schools of painting. The murals detailing the Battle of Polilur and other painted work at the Daria Daulat Bagh palace of Tipu Sultan in Ganjam, Srirangapatna are also prime examples of the Mysore school of painting. After the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 AD the state was restored back to the Wodeyars of Mysore and its ruler Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1799-1868 AD) who was contemporaneous with Serfoji II of Thanjavur ushered in a new era by reviving the ancient traditions of Mysore and extending patronage to music, sculpture, painting, dancing and literature. Most of the traditional paintings of the Mysore School, which have survived until today, belong to this reign. Further, Krishnaraja Wodeyar provided new fillip to the artists of the Mysore school through his Magnum opus Sritattvanidhi, which would remain the ready reckoner on Mysore style for many years to come. On the walls of Jagan Mohan Palace, Mysore (Karnataka), the fascinating range of paintings which flourished under Krishnaraja Wodeyar can be seen; from portraits of the Mysore rulers, their family members and important personages in Indian history, through self-portraits of the artists themselves which Krishnaraja Wodeyar coaxed them to paint, to murals depicting the Hindu pantheon and Puranic and mythological scenes. Literary and Inscriptional The most famous of the manuscripts detailing the various nuances of the Mysore school and listing out the various Gods and Goddesses, is the Sritattvanidhi, a voluminous work of 1500 pages prepared under the patronage of Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. This pictorial digest is a compendium of illustrations of gods, goddesses and mythological figures with instructions to painters on an incredible range of topics concerning composition placement, colour choice, individual attributes and mood. The ragas, seasons, eco-happenings, animals, and plant world are also effectively depicted in these paintings as co-themes or contexts. Other Sanskrit literary sources such as the Visnudharmottara Purana, Abhilasitarthacintamani and Sivatatvaratnakara also throw light on the objectives and principles of painting, methods of preparing pigments, brushes and the carrier, qualifications of the chitrakar (traditional community of painters) the principles of painting and the technique to be followed. Materials The ancient painters in Mysore prepared their own materials. The colours were from natural sources and were of vegetable, mineral or even organic origin such as leaves, stones and flowers. Brushes were made with squirrel hairs for delicate work but for drawing superfine lines a brush made of pointed blades of a special variety of grass had to be used. Due to the long-lasting quality of the earth and vegetable colours used, the original Mysore paintings still retain their freshness and lustre even today. Technique & Characteristic Mysore Painting depicting Krishna with his eight principal wives. Mysore Paintings are characterized by delicate lines, intricate brush strokes, graceful delineation of figures and the discreet use of bright vegetable colours and lustrous gold leaf. More than mere decorative pieces, the paintings are designed to inspire feelings of devotion and humility in the viewer. The painter‚Äôs individual skill in giving expression to various emotions is therefore of paramount importance to this style of painting. The first stage of Mysore Painting was to prepare the ground; paper, wood, cloth or wall grounds were variously used. The paper board was made of paper pulp or waste paper, which was dried in the sun and then rubbed smooth with a polished quartz pebble. If the ground was cloth it was pasted on a wooden board using a paste composed of dry white lead (safeda) mixed with gum and a small quantity of gruel (ganji). The board was then dried and burnished. Wood surfaces were prepared by applying dry white lead, yellow ochre and gum, and walls were treated with yellow ochre, chalk and gum. After preparation of the ground a rough sketch of the picture was drawn with crayon prepared from the straight twigs of the tamarind tree. The next step was to paint the furthest objects such as sky, hill and river and then gradually animal and human figures were approached in greater detail. After colouring the figures, the artists would turn to elaboration of the faces, dress and ornaments including the gesso work (gold covering), which is an important feature of Mysore painting. Gesso Work Gesso work was the hallmark of all traditional paintings of Karnataka. Gesso refers to the paste mixture of white lead powder, gambose and glue which is used as an embossing material and covered with gold foil. The gesso work in Mysore paintings is low in relief and intricate as compared to the thick gold relief work of the Tanjore School. Gesso was used in Mysore painting for depicting intricate designs of clothes, jewellery and architectural details on pillars and arches that usually framed the deities. The work was taken up in the morning when the base of the gold work on the painting was still moist so as to hold the gold foil firmly. After allowing the painting to dry, glazing was carried out by covering the painting with thin paper and rubbing over it with a soft glazing stone known as kaslupada kallu. When the thin paper was removed the painting shone brightly and looked resplendent with the combination of gold and a variety of colours.

On December 1, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Ochoa Bishop of the Diocese of Fresno, California, succeeding Bishop John Steinbock who had died of lung cancer in December 2010. On March 5, 2019, Pope Francis accepted Ochoa's resignation. Positions Ochoa considers the ordination of woman priests to be a moot point due to papal opposition; he believes that homosexuals should remain celibate in accordance with Church doctrine requiring all unmarried people to remain celibate; he believes that the priest shortage will be solved through faith rather than through allowing a married priesthood; and he fears that teaching children about condoms in a school setting would send a \\"mixed message\\" regarding pre-marital sex. Ochoa is an advocate of diocesan foster care programs and responsible water use.

The north of the square is bounded by Princess Street and the south by Peter Street. To the west of the square is Manchester Central Library, Midland Hotel and Manchester Town Hall Extension. The square is home to the Manchester Cenotaph, the Emmeline Pankhurst statue, and St Peter's Square Metrolink tram stop and incorporates the Peace Garden. In 1819, the area around the square was the site of the Peterloo Massacre. From 2010 to 2017, the square underwent significant redevelopment which entailed the restoration of Central Library and attached Library Walk link, the relocation of the Cenotaph to the rear of Manchester Town Hall, the creation of a new extended tram stop and the construction of two new office blocks to the south of the square; One St Peter's Square and Two St Peter's Square. History A map of St Peter's Field and surrounding area on 16 August 1819 The area around St Peter's Square, then known as St Peter's Field,Revived by recent developers as 'Peter's Fields' for the area to the west. was the site of the 1819 Peterloo Massacre. The name derives from St Peter's Church which was built in 1788-94 where the gardens are today and also gave its name to Peter Street. The church was built in the neoclassical style by the architect James Wyatt, and was once famous for its church music. It was demolished in 1907 and the Cenotaph replaced it in 1924. A stone cross (1908) commemorates the church. The square is the site for the city's Remembrance Day commemoration each year. In the 1930s, the square was redeveloped around the construction of the Central Library and Town Hall Extension (1930‚Äì34). Plans for a rapid transit station in St Peter's Square were made in the 1970s; proposals for the abandoned Picc-Vic tunnel envisaged the construction of an underground station to serve both St Peter's and the neighbouring Albert Square. publicity brochure The early proposals for an on-street light rail system in Manchester revived the idea of a station in the square, and the idea was retained as the project evolved, becoming a reality when the Metrolink system opened in 1992. Redevelopment Night view In 2013, Manchester City Council approved plans for the redevelopment of the square, including the expansion of the Metrolink stop to four platforms. This coincided with the construction of the One and Two St Peter's Square buildings and the refurbishment of Manchester Central Library, both adjacent to the square. Numerous archaeological finds were made when construction work uncovered the former crypt of the long-demolished St. Peter's Church, which had a concrete raft built over it in order to safely construct the new tram lines. The outline of the church is marked in the paving around the square. The scheme involved using ¬£20 million of public money, moving the Cenotaph, moving the Peace Gardens, demolishing an inter-war building to establish a new office quarter and closing Library Walk to the public. The plans were criticised as bland, unrealistic and private sector orientated rather than public orientated. In response to the criticisms Darryl Lee, director of Mosley Street Ventures, said: \\"The developers have had lengthy and detailed discussions about their proposals with English Heritage and Manchester City Council, who have pronounced themselves happy with the scheme\\". An English Heritage spokesperson added: \\"Long before Century House was built, St Peter‚Äôs Square was envisaged as a grand civic space, and English Heritage feels that the Simpson scheme, taken with other developments which are under way, goes some way to realising that ambition. While we think that Century House makes a positive contribution to the conservation area, we feel that its loss is outweighed by the public benefits of the scheme.\\" A statue of Emmeline Pankhurst was unveiled on 14 December 2018 to commemorate 100 years since women were first allowed to vote in United Kingdom general elections.

He worked for Zenith Electronics, retiring as the company's Vice President and Director of Research. His work included developing early sound-based remote controls for televisions, which were the standard for 25 years until replaced by infrared (IR) remotes that could transmit more complex commands. Achievements Adler was born in Vienna in 1913, the son of Jenny (n√©e Herzmark), a doctor, and Max Adler, a social theorist. He earned a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Vienna in 1937. Following Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938, Dr. Adler, who was Jewish, left the country. He traveled first to Belgium, then to England, where he acted on the advice of friends, who recommended that he emigrate to the United States. After emigrating to the United States, he began working at Zenith Electronics in the research division in 1941. In his lifetime, Adler was granted more than 180 US patents. Contributions to the remote control The invention Adler is best known for is the wireless remote control for televisions. While not the first remote control, its underlying technology was a vast improvement over previous remote control systems. The \\"Zenith Flash- Matic\\" remote control, invented by Eugene Polley, another engineer at Zenith, was the first wireless remote control, replacing the signal cable based remote control devices, which never were a success. The Flash-Matic used directional flashlight in the transmitter device, and photo cells in the television set itself. One of the major shortcomings of this technology was that if the television set was exposed to direct sunlight, it could inadvertently trigger one of the remote control functions. The company president sent the engineers back to the drawing board to come up with a better solution. A Zenith Space Commander 600 remote control. A system based on radio waves was briefly considered but rejected because the signals could easily travel through walls and could inadvertently change the channel on a neighbor's television. Furthermore, the marketing people at Zenith desired a remote control which did not require batteries, as it was perceived at the time that if the battery died, the customer might think something was wrong with the television set itself. Adler's solution was to use sound waves to transmit signals to the TV. The first remote control he developed, the \\"Space Commander\\", used aluminum rods, analogous to tuning forks, struck by hammers toggled by the buttons on the device, to produce high-frequency tones that would be interpreted to control functions on the television set. In the 1960s, Adler modified the remote control to use ultrasonic signals, a technology which went on to be used in television sets manufactured for the next 25 years, until replaced by infrared systems which could transmit more complex commands, but require batteries to run. Professional accomplishments By the time of his retirement from Zenith, officially in 1982, Adler was the company's Vice President and Director of Research. He remained a technical advisor to Zenith until 1999. In 1980, Adler was awarded the Edison Medal. In 1997, Adler and Polley were jointly awarded an Emmy Award by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Adler's last patent application was filed on October 6, 2006 for work on touch-screen technology. Death Robert Adler died in a Boise, Idaho, nursing home of heart failure at age 93.

Secretly deranged by years of torture as a POW in the Vietnam War, he had a bitter court martial on his return and a failed marriage. He longs to commit suicide and to take with him as many as possible of the cheerful, carefree U.S. civilians he sees from his blimp each weekend. Lander is desperately in love with Dahlia Iyad, an operative from the Palestinian terrorist group Black September, who controls and manipulates him. They conspire together to launch a suicide attack using a bomb composed of plastique and a quarter-million steel flechettes. They plan to mount the bomb on the underside of the gondola of the Goodyear blimp which traditionally flies over the Super Bowl football game, and detonate it over the Miami Orange Bowl during Super Bowl X, in order to call attention to the plight of the Palestinians and to punish the US for supporting Israel. During a raid on a Black September unit in the Middle East, the Israeli counter-terrorist Mossad agent David Kabakov surprises Iyad while she is bathing. His mission was to kill everyone in the unit; however, seeing her unarmed and naked, he spares her life and turns his attention to clearing the rest of the unit. She escapes. When the raid is complete, Kabakov finds a recorded message which Iyad had planned to publish after the terrorist attack. The recording explains the motive for the terrorism, but does not include any specific information about the attack plan itself. Collaborating with FBI agent Sam Corley, Kabakov tries to learn the details of the plan. Together, they are able to trace the path of a large amount of plastic explosive which Black September has illegally shipped into the USA. During the Super Bowl game, Kabakov figures out that Iyad and Lander have mounted the bomb on the Goodyear blimp. He and Corley commandeer a helicopter and set out in pursuit of the blimp, accompanied by several other police helicopters. Loaded with the bomb, the blimp approaches the stadium. Lander pilots the blimp while Iyad exchanges deadly gunfire with policemen in the pursuing helicopters. From his place in one helicopter, Kabakov sees Iyad's face, and recognizes her as the Black September agent whose life he had previously spared. This time he doesn't hesitate; he shoots and kills her. Lander is mortally wounded, but he lasts long enough to succeed in flying the blimp straight into the Super Bowl, causing mass panic and destruction in the stadium. Just before dying, Lander lights the fuse of the blimp's bomb. With just minutes away from detonation, Kabakov lowers himself from the helicopter to the blimp, and hooks it up with a cable to the helicopter, which hauls it out of the panicked stadium and over the ocean. Kabakov unhooks the cable from the blimp, and clings to the cable as the helicopter moves away to a safe distance. A few seconds later, the bomb detonates, firing the flechettes harmlessly into the water. Goodyear Blimps Columbia and America, seen in 1984: Both blimps were separately used in the film.

Director John Frankenheimer's frequent line producer Robert L. Rosen was credited as executive producer. As it hinged on filming a real Goodyear Blimp at a real Super Bowl, many challenges existed. Luckily, Frankenheimer had a good relationship with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company head Robert Lane, as a result of working with Goodyear on his earlier film Grand Prix.Pomerance and Palmer 2011, p. 106. Lane told Frankenheimer, \\"You're the only person I've ever worked with who has kept his word.\\"Frankenheimer Rides a Blimp To a Big, Fat Comeback 1977/04/10 nytimes.com Frankenheimer told Goodyear that if they declined the use of their blimps, he would rent the only other large blimp in the world from Germany, paint it silver, and people would assume it was theirs anyway. Lane granted Frankenheimer use of Goodyear's blimps on three conditions: the film had to make clear that the villainous pilot did not work directly for Goodyear, but for a contractor; the final explosion could not come out of the word Goodyear on the blimp's side; and the blimp itself could not be part of any violence, for example nobody was to be churned up in its propellers. Evans helped secure the unprecedented cooperation of the National Football League and the production was allowed to film at Super Bowl X on January 18, 1976 and shoot extensive footage with the principal actors for the film's final half hour as the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Dallas Cowboys 21‚Äì17.Pomerance and Palmer 2011, pp. 107‚Äì108. The production returned to the Miami Orange Bowl the week of January 29, 1976, to film the final moments of the pursuit, as the blimp crashes into the stadium. A mockup nose section of the blimp was recreated. The thousands of extras needed for this footage, which obviously could not be shot during the real Super Bowl, were instead provided by the United Way charity, in exchange for Frankenheimer directing a promotional film for them, narrated by Shaw. Members of the Miami Dolphins were hired and outfitted with Cowboys and Steelers uniforms to appear in the footage as well. During filming of the chaotic scenes of panic as the blimp descends into the crowds, Dolphins player Barry Hill fell and injured himself, requiring a splint and a bandage on his right hand.https://www.palmbeachpost.com/entertainmentlife/20190129/why-did- thousands-of-palm-beach-county-residents-appear-in-super-bowl-movie Blimps Goodyear granted the film use of all three of its U.S.-based blimps for Black Sunday.

Reception Black Sunday was among the highest-scoring films ever in the history of Paramount Pictures test screenings, and was widely predicted in the industry as a \\"second Jaws\\". When it was released in March 1977, however, the film performed well below expectations. John Frankenheimer later said the film was hurt by the fact another movie about terrorism at a championship football game, Two- Minute Warning, had come out just beforehand and performed poorly. He also blamed the fact the movie was banned in Germany and Japan. Still, it became regarded by some as one of Frankenheimer's best thrillers. Although receiving generally favorable critical reviews, Black Sunday was appreciated more for its technical virtues and storyline than its character development. Reviewer Vincent Canby from The New York Times tried to rationalize his reaction: \\"I suspect it has to do with the constant awareness that the story is more important than anybody in it ... The characters don't motivate the drama in any real way.\\" In a later review, Christopher Null took exception and identified the one key character who drove the plot: \\"... Black Sunday is distinguished by its unique focus not on the hero but on the villain: Bruce Dern ...\\" Null, Christopher. \\"Black Sunday.\\" Filmcritic.com, October 11, 2003. John Simon said that Black Sunday \\"is one of those films that are perfectly enjoyable to watch but which there is not all that much to say\\". Simon did praise the acting of Robert Shaw, Bruce Dern, Fritz Weaver, Michael V. Gazzo, William Daniels, Steven Keats and Walter Gotell, but said Marthe Keller lacked power and had no charisma. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 69% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 7.36/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"A smart, tense thriller from director John Frankenheimer, Black Sunday succeeds on a technical level, even if it fails to bring its characters to vivid life.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Homage Quentin Tarantino has said in interviews that the sequence in Kill Bill: Volume 1 where Daryl Hannah attempts to kill The Bride in disguise as a nurse is an homage to a similar sequence in Black Sunday. More specifically, he said the fact that the sequence in his film is done with split-screens is actually an homage to the trailer for Black Sunday, which shows shots from the sequence in that manner, unlike in the actual film.Rose, Steve. \\"Found: where Tarantino gets his ideas\\".

He was a prosperous farmer in 1860 when the census was taken. His residence was listed as Rhinebeck, New York.U.S. Census of 1860. He left behind an elderly father and two sisters when he joined the army in the early autumn of 1861 at the age of 34. His diary was begun on October 1 of that year. Civil War Wainwright was commissioned a major in the 1st New York Artillery on October 17, 1861, and served throughout the war as an artillery officer in the Army of the Potomac. Early in his service, he was recorder of a board used to weed out unfit officers. He was present with his guns at the Battle of Antietam and the Battle of Fredericksburg. His batteries supported the attack of the Pennsylvania Reserves on the Confederate right flank at the latter battle. Wainwright was chief of artillery of I Corps at the Battle of Chancellorsville. His actions in that battle were praised by the army's chief of artillery, Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt. He commanded the artillery brigade of the I Corps at the Battle of Gettysburg. During the struggle for control of Cemetery Hill on July 2, 1863, Wainwright commanded all the guns on the eastern part of the hill. His batteries were instrumental in helping repulse the twilight attack of the Louisiana Tigers, and they dueled with Confederate artillery the following day preceding Pickett's Charge. When Maj. Gen. George G. Meade reorganized the Army of the Potomac in 1864, Wainwright became chief of artillery of V Corps, replacing Augustus P. Martin. He served in that role to the end of the war. Among his most successful actions was using guns to break a Confederate attack at the Battle of North Anna. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general on August 1, 1864. He was the author of A Diary of Battle: The Personal Journals of Colonel Charles S. Wainwright, 1861‚Äì1865, published posthumously in 1962. His journals provide insights into the administration of the artillery, as well as its use in battle. Wainwright's observations on the Union commanders with whom he served are pungent. Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, under whom he had served in V Corps, and Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker receive particularly negative reviews.Wainwright, pp. 226, 456. Post-war activities After the war, Wainwright resided in Dutchess County, New York, in Europe and then in Washington, D.C.. He belonged to the Metropolitan Club and the Sons of the American Revolution. Wainwright died in Washington, D.C., on September 13, 1907, at the George Washington University Hospital. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. Wainwright died unmarried, and his brother inherited the manuscripts of the diary he kept during the war.

The regiment was the first United States Army unit to land on Guadalcanal during World War II  History = World War I and interwar years  The 164th Infantry Regiment began its history on 8 December 1906 in the North Dakota Army National Guard as Company E, First Infantry Regiment, Williston, North Dakota. It was activated in federal service on 18 June 1916 for service on the Mexican border. On 14 February 1917, Company E was inactivated at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. Company E was later re-activated on 25 March 1917 and drafted into federal service on 5 August 1917. The company was reorganized and redesignated 4 October 1917 as Company E, 164th Infantry, an element of the 41st Infantry Division. The company was inactivated 28 February 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey. The company was later reorganized and federally recognized 22 January 1921 as Company E, 1st Infantry, Williston, North Dakota. It was reorganized and redesignated 21 October 1921 as Company E, 164th Infantry, an element of the 34th Infantry Division. L. R.

Prairie Public Broadcasting ¬ª Dakota Datebook The 164th Infantry, Company G was based out of Glendive, Montana.  World War II  The 164th Infantry, a unit of the North Dakota National Guard, was activated into Federal service 10 February 1941 at Williston. Before deployment overseas, the 164th was relieved from assignment to the 34th Infantry Division on 8 December 1941. Commanded by Colonel Earle Sarles, the 164th transited the South Pacific ferry route in January 1942 to New Caledonia. There they joined the 182nd Infantry Regiment and the 132nd Infantry Regiment, in addition to artillery, engineer and other support units to form a new division on 24 May 1942, designated the Americal Division. The name Americal was derived from a combination of the words America and New Caledonia. The regiment spent nearly five months in combat training. In September, Colonel Sarles, a National Guard officer, was replaced as commander of the regiment by Colonel Bryant E. Moore, a West Point graduate. Moore would subsequently be promoted to command an infantry division in Europe, and the regiment would serve under other commanders, almost all of whom advanced to general's stars. Arriving at Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 ahead of its brother regiments as emergency reinforcement for the 1st Marine Division, the Regiment was the first U.S. Army unit to engage in offensive action during World War II in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Between 24 and 27 October, elements of the regiment withstood repeated assaults from Japanese battalions and inflicted some two thousand enemy casualties. The First Marine commander, Major General A. A. Vandegrift, was so impressed by the soldiers' stand that he issued a unit commendation to the regiment for having demonstrated \\"an overwhelming superiority over the enemy.\\" In addition, the Marines took the unusual step of awarding Lt. Colonel Robert Hall, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 164th, with the Navy Cross for his role in these battles.Shoptaugh, Terry, They Were Ready: The 164th Infantry in the Pacific War, 164th Infantry Association, 2010. Until the Americal Division commander, Major General Alexander M. Patch, and other units of the division arrived, the 164th fought alongside the Marines in a series of encounters with Japanese units in the Point Cruz area, where they successfully dislodged enemy troops from two hilltop strongpoints. The action earned them the nickname \\"The 164th Marines.\\" Members of the 164th were also known as \\"jungle fighters\\" within the U.S. media because of the terrain on which they fought. Later, the 164th participated in extensive jungle patrols as well as organized offensive sweeps of the island to eliminate remaining Japanese resistance. This experience gained the regiment valuable combat experience in jungle travel and navigation, ambush and counter-ambush, and small-unit tactics using small arms and light support weapons. After the Battle of Guadalcanal, the regiment returned to Fiji with the rest of the Americal Division to refit and replenish losses. At this point, many veteran officers and men of the 164th volunteered to join the 5307th Composite Unit, better known as Merrill's Marauders, for service in Burma.George, John B. (Lt. Col), Shots Fired In Anger, NRA Press (1981), p. 420 With the rest of the Americal, the Regiment later participated in the Bougainville campaign, then fought to secure the islands of Leyte, Cebu, Negros, and Bohol, in the Philippines. The regiment was slated to be part of the invasion of Japan when the war ended in August. Woodrow W. Keeble, the first Sioux Medal of Honor recipient, served with the 164th throughout the war. He was wounded several times and awarded the Purple Heart and multiple awards for valor during World War II. His Medal of Honor, officially recognized in 2008, came for his actions in the Korean War.

As he landed on the beach on Guadalcanal, he was struck by shrapnel from a bomb dropped by a Japanese plane.  Inter war service  The 164th was inactivated 24 November 1945 at Fort Lawton, Washington. On 10 June 1946, the 164th Infantry was relieved from assignment to the Americal Division and assigned to the 47th Infantry Division. On 1 May 1947, the 164th was reorganized and federally recognized 1 May 1947 as Company E of the 164th Infantry at Williston.

He mentions them first as taking up arms in 200 BC, in concert with the Gaulish tribes of the Insubres and Cenomani, to destroy the Roman colonies of Placentia (modern Piacenza) and Cremona. They are again noticed three years later as being still in arms, after the submission of their Transpadane allies; but in the course of that year's campaign (197 BC) they were reduced by the consul Quintus Minucius Rufus, and their name does not again appear in history. (Liv. xxx. 10, xxxi. 29, 30.) From the circumstances here related, it is clear that they dwelt on the north slopes of the Apennines, towards the plains of the Padus (modern Po River), and apparently not very far from Clastidium (modern Casteggio); but we cannot determine with certainty either the position or extent of their territory. Their name, like those of most of the Ligurian tribes mentioned by Livy, had disappeared in the Augustan age, and is not found in any of the ancient geographers.

Its purpose was to show the German soldiers the different types of infantry anti-tank warfare. The duration of the film is 28 minutes. The film consists of three parts. The first part shows a staged combined Soviet tank and infantry attack against entrenched German infantry. The attack is preceded by artillery and air strikes. The tanks, several T-34 model 1941/1942/1943 and a KV-1, are dealt with and destroyed by different means of improvised and dedicated anti-tank weaponry. Right and wrong approaches to destroy a tank single-handedly are displayed. At the end of the attack, Wilhelm Niggemeyer, a holder of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and four tank destruction badges, is shown in action, destroying the KV-1 with a mine. The second part shows how rear-service troops must be prepared for anti-tank warfare, as they too can encounter enemy tanks. The third part presents the Grosse Gewehrpanzergranate, Kampfpistole 42LP, P√ºppchen, Panzerfaust, Panzerschreck, their use and their effect against tanks. The Soviet equipment used in the film, including uniforms and weapons, are authentic captured Soviet stock. The Soviet officer's uniforms were made before the 1943 reforms of the uniform. The only exception are the aircraft used, the AT-6, which were captured in the Battle of France. During the Cold War the film was used for training purposes by several NATO armies.

History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution is a book by Mercy Otis Warren. Warren was a correspondent and adviser to many political leaders of the Revolutionary period, including Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and especially John Adams, who became her literary mentor in the years leading to the Revolution. It was published in three volumes, totalling 1,317 pages. Her magnum opus, the book covers the whole Revolutionary period, from the Stamp Act to the events leading to the writing and ratification of the United States Constitution. The book is written in a personal style but, as is many of Warren's works, it is written in the third person. The book contained still-controversial views about the Revolution, including her idea that the Battle of Yorktown, the final battle of the Revolution, was really not a battle at all. Roughly one third of the book concerns events after Yorktown. Warren wrote drafts of the book during the events as they unfolded and had it published, after four years of additions, in 1805. She credited the delay to health problems, temporary bouts of blindness, and grief at the death of three of her five sons. President Thomas Jefferson ordered copies of the books for himself and his cabinet and wrote that \\"her truthful and insightful account of the last thirty years will furnish a more instructive lesson to mankind than any equal period known in history.\\" An 1851 Christmas Eve fire destroyed almost two thirds of the books that Jefferson had sold to the Library of Congress in 1815. The flames almost claimed the book, as noted by the singeing of the title page. However, John Adams considered it to be a radical simplification and sometimes a falsification of the true history of the Revolution. After its publication, Adams and Warren exchanged a somewhat hysterical series of letters debating the issue ferociously, especially Adams's part in the Revolution.

On his father's death he became the Titular Mexican Emperor and he would be a claimant to his father's empire for forty years until the Second Mexican Empire was established under Maximilian I of Mexico. Bol√≠var's friend Iturbide completed his education at Ampleforth College and received a letter of recommendation saying that he was \\"a good son, a good brother and a good patriot who will use his experiences and riches for God and for good\\". After just a few years, Don Agust√≠n left the UK and travelled to New Granada (present-day Colombia and Panama) where he eventually met and befriended Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the military and political leader of Venezuela. Don Agust√≠n was made an Adjutant General under Bol√≠var. When the Mexican foreign minister complained about the presence of the Prince Imperial in South America, Bol√≠var who wanted only to protect the young and unfortunate prince, replied this: \\"You must calm your mind to his presence, because he would not compete for his father's throne for a thousand reasons\\".

Caracas In 1831 the Mexican Congress declared that the banishment decree on the former imperial family had been lifted and the Prince Imperial subsequently returned to his homeland. Later life and death On his return to the United Mexican States he started working as a Mexican diplomat. He first served at the Mexican embassy in the United States, a post he would retain until 19 March 1833, and would later be transferred to London where he would be stationed until 1835. He was making only 3,500 pesos a year, but he still maintained the large fortune gathered by his deceased father. He also served as a volunteer in the Papal Zouaves, an infantry force created to protect the Papal States. At the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he decided to participate in the defence of his homeland. During the Battle of Padierna on 19 and 20 August 1847, he took command over the Celaya Regiment and tried to rouse his men with his famous patriotic cry: \\"With me boys! My father is the father of our independence\\". The battle of Padierna during the Mexican- American War. When the Mexican monarchy was revived as the Second Mexican Empire under Maximilian I of Mexico, Don Agust√≠n gave up his claim to the throne and voluntarily approved of the new emperor; he also approved Maximilian's request to adopt two of the Prince Imperial's nephews, Agust√≠n de Iturbide y Green and Salvador de Iturbide y de Marz√°n. He remained the head of the former Imperial House of Iturbide. Though Don Agust√≠n de Iturbide y Green was proclaimed the new heir apparent he never received his uncle's title of Prince Imperial; this was due to Don Agust√≠n still being alive. Don Agust√≠n died on 11 December 1866 in New York City. He had been an important figure in both the imperial monarchies; he was largely overlooked when working for the United Mexican States, but did gain some notoriety while serving under Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. The Prince Imperial was buried in Philadelphia next to his mother. Many members of the former Imperial family House of Iturbide would be buried at the same location. Because he died without ever marrying or fathering any legitimate children, his title of Prince Imperial of Mexico was transferred to Maria Josepha Sophia de Iturbide, the daughter of Don Salvador de Iturbide y de Marz√°n. He fathered an illegitimate daughter by Nicolasa Fern√°ndez de Pierola, a woman from Arequipa in Peru.

The station was opened in 1877 is located on the Berlin Northern Railway and the now closed Nauen‚ÄìOranienburg railway and Oranienburg‚ÄìVelten railway. The train services are operated by Deutsche Bahn and Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn. History After the construction of the Wall on August 13, 1961, the S-Bahn line was interrupted to Berlin on the border with West Berlin between Hohen Neuendorf and Berlin-Frohnau, thus travelling alone. Later on, the track of the Berlin outer ring between Hohen Neuendorf and the Karower Kreuz was temporarily provided with a busbar and built an additional connecting curve between outer ring and northern railway at Hohen Neuendorf, so that from 19 November 1961 again a direct S-Bahn traffic to East Berlin was possible. After some restrictions in the early years was possible since the mid-1960s again a continuous 20-minute cycle on the S-Bahn. For decades, the S-Bahn trains from Oranienburg via Birkenwerder, Blankenburg, Ostkreuz to Sch√∂nefeld Airport; in the evening and weekend traffic partly to Spindlersfeld. The rapid-transit railway handled the entire local passenger traffic between Oranienburg and Berlin, other passenger trains stopped because of limited capacities in this relation no more. The passenger trains to the north to various destinations on the northern railway and to the branches in L√∂wenberg (Mark) routes to Templin and Rheinsberg or Neuruppin began in Oranienburg. In addition, there were some trains between Oranienburg and Hennigsdorf on Birkenwerder and until the suspension of passenger traffic on these routes in the 1960s in the direction of Velten and Nauen Kremmen. With the expansion of the ports in Rostock and Stralsund, the growing population in the north of the GDR and the increasing tourism, the importance of the Northern Railway and also the Oranienburg station for the long-distance and freight traffic grew. All express trains between Berlin and Rostock or Stralsund via Neubrandenburg stopped at the station; since November 1976 also a St√§dteexpress train pair. By the outer ring of Berlin, the bypass railway and the 1950/1951 built links to Basdorf and Velten had lost their meaning. The passenger traffic from Oranienburg via Kremmen to Nauen was discontinued in 1967, the one after Velten in 1969. While the latter line was shut down and dismantled a few years later, the lines to Nauen and Basdorf, which had never had scheduled passenger services, remained in service for freight, as diversion and military strategic reserve until the mid-1990s. The conversion of the railway systems between Oranienburg and Lehnitz began in 1977. On this section, both the S-Bahn and the mainline ran only a single track. In several stages until 1990, first the S-Bahn (with the exception of a 400 -meter-long section at the station entrance of Oranienburg), then expanded the long-haul double-track. During conversion, the junction of the Nauen bypass was redesigned. While she used to run over the Nordbahn tracks on an overpass and was only connected to her at the Oranienburg station, she subsequently joined the Nordbahn at the same level. The rails between the intersection and the station were removed. Since 1982, the station was gradually rebuilt. The former platform of the bypass railway became a direction platform for trains to the north. In October 1987, a modern track diagram was inaugurated. On December 15, 1983, the electrical operation between Birkenwerder and L√∂wenberg (Mark) and thus also in Oranienburg station was added. In May 1992, the S-Bahn line reopened between Hohen Neuendorf and Frohnau and provides the direct connection from Oranienburg towards the Berlin city center. Since then S1 operates between Oranienburg and Berlin Wannsee. The route to Basdorf has been out of service since 1995 (with the exception of short-term railcar rides in 1998). Also in the mid-1990s, the bypass between Oranienburg and Nauen was shut down. In 2001, this station was heavily renovated.

In his freshman year of 1999, he played sparingly behind former Crimson Tide running back and future NFL star Shaun Alexander. That year, he won an SEC Championship under head coach Mike Dubose. Galloway rushed for 33 yards on seven carries. Fall 2000 served as his coming out year. His sophomore campaign started on a high note as he scored a pair of touchdowns against UCLA. While not the feature back that season, he still played a significant role in each of the Crimson Tide's games. He shared time with former Alabama running back Santonio Beard; He rushed for 659 yards on 137 carries. Galloway had seven touchdowns to his credit that season. Ahmaad's junior year of 2001, gave Crimson Tide fans glimpses of greatness. He rushed for over 230 yards in his second game against the Vanderbilt Commodores. However, his most notable game was against the Tide's biggest rival Auburn University. He rushed for over 130 yards to lead the Tide to a victory over the Tigers. Galloway carried the ball 174 times for 881 yards and six touchdowns that season. Ahmaad had great expectations coming into his senior year of 2002. However, in an early game against Southern Mississippi, he suffered a season-ending knee injury.

The bridge is a single-span concrete Marsh arch bridge and is the sole surviving bridge of this type on the entire length of the former highway. Two other Marsh arch bridges were also located on US-66 in Kansas, both over the Spring River. It was built in 1923. The bridge has often been covered with graffiti, but was recently re-painted white. The bridge has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places (as the Brush Creek Bridge) on March 10, 1983, due to its connection with US-66 and is also a Kansas state landmark. In 2014, Kansas Rt. 66 Historic Byway nominated a bypassed section of original 1926 highway, which ran south from the Brush Creek to the Willow Creek bridge near Baxter Springs, for an NRHP listing. The bridge is fairly narrow, and due to traffic on the road, a replacement bridge has been built. The road curves toward the new bridge toward Baxter Springs, but a short, one-way road carries traffic to the Rainbow Bridge, which may still be crossed. This was part of a compromise after a disagreement between the county and the Kansas Route 66 Association as federal funds used for construction of the new bridge required demolition of the old. The bridge had been listed with the National Register, which prohibited condemnation of the old bridge.

Early middle ages  The term used by western historians, for burdei-type housing on the Lower Danube and in the Carpathians during the 6th‚Äì7th centuries AD, is Grubenhaus. Poluzemlianki is used by Russian researchers. The Russian term refers to a structure partially dug into the ground, often less than 1 m deep. The Grubenhaus was erected over a rectangular pit, ranging in size from four square meters to twenty-five square meters of floor area. During the 6th and 7th centuries the sunken buildings east and south of the Carpathians, were under 15 square meters in floor surface.Florin Curta The Making of Slavs page 282 The experiments of the Archeological Open-Air Museum in B≈ôezno near Louny have reconstructed the living and temperature conditions in the dug houses.http://www.about- czechia.com/brezno/history.php> > The building experiment consisted of two houses, which were exact replicas > of two sunken buildings excavated on the site, one of the late sixth or > early seventh century, the other of the ninth.

Thus, a Romanian burdei could have multiple rooms, typically a fire-room where the stove was installed, a cellar, and a living room.Castranova Village Museum (in Romanian).  North America  This type of shelter was created by many of the earliest Ukrainian Canadian settlers as their first home in Canada at the end of the 19th century. The first step was to peel back and save the sod, then excavate the earth to a depth of approximately a metre. A poplar roof frame was then created, over which the saved sod would be laid. Then a window, a door, a wood stove, and a bed platform would be installed. A typical burdei measured no more than two by four metres. The burdei was a temporary refuge until a \\"proper\\" home of poplar logs and mud/straw plaster could be built. Mennonites from Imperial Russia settled in the Hillsboro region of Kansas, and also built burdei housings as temporary shelters. This type of shelter was also called a zemlyanka or a saraj (a Low German spelling for a Russian word meaning \\"shed\\").

Weekend programming included talk shows hosted by Dennis Prager, Steve Gill, and Hugh Hewitt, plus Outdoors with Alan Warren and Viewpoint Alabama. The station signs off at sunset each night to protect WLW at Cincinnati, Ohio, and KBYR at Anchorage, Alaska, from skywave interference. History=Launch In response to an application filed in September 1986 by Holy Ground Broadcasting, Inc., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a construction permit for a new radio station on 700 kHz with 5,000 watts of power on February 21, 1990. The station would be allowed to operate only during daylight hours to protect the clear channel signal of WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio. The new station was assigned call sign WGZS on March 14, 1990. After a renewal, an extension, and a reinstatement, the construction permit and the unfinished station were sold to Genesis Radio Company, Inc., in July 1994. The FCC approved the deal on September 30, 1994, and the transaction was consummated on October 21, 1994. In April 1995, the FCC authorized the still-under construction station to move its transmitter location and reduce its power output to 1,600 watts. Finally, six years after the original construction permit was granted and more than a decade after the initial application was filed, WGZS received its broadcast license on October 31, 1996. WGZS era In July 1996, Genesis Radio Company reached a deal to sell WGZS to Willis Broadcasting through their Dothan Christian Radio, Inc., subsidiary for a reported $65,000. The deal gained FCC approval on October 31, 1996, but the transaction was never consummated. Genesis Radio Company tried a second time to sell the now-operational WGZS, this time to Celebration Communications Company, Inc., in April 1998. The FCC approved the deal on June 30, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on July 22, 1998. Celebration Communications Company in turn reached an agreement to sell WGZS to Satellite Radio Network president Michael B. Glinter in October 2001. The FCC approved the deal on April 16, 2002, and the transaction was consummated on July 1, 2002. The station's format shifted to Contemporary Christian music. Glinter agreed to sell WGZS to James T. Lee in July 2002 and the deal gained FCC approval on September 13, 2002. However, the station fell silent on October 14, 2002, for \\"technical\\" reasons and the transaction was never consummated. In August 2003, with the station still off the air, Glinter made a deal to sell the station to Good Samaritan Communications of Pioche, Inc. (Michael Augustus, president), for $165,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on October 7, 2003, with a \\"silent condition\\" and the transaction was consummated on October 24, 2003. In December 2004, Good Samaritan Communications of Pioche signed a contract to sell WGZS to Tropicana Media, LLC, for $135,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on March 24, 2005, and the transaction was consummated on April 6, 2005. At the time of the sale, the station broadcast a soft rock music format. This ownership would prove short-lived as in December 2005, Tropicana Media made a deal to sell the station and transfer the broadcast license to Victory Broadcasting Company, LLC, for a total of $151,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on February 24, 2006, and the transaction was successfully consummated on March 29, 2006. WEEL era Logo used until mid-2007. WGZS, which had been dark since October 3, 2006, was purchased in late 2006 from Victory Broadcasting Company by broadcasters Jack and Lois \\"Lovey\\" Gale, doing business as Jalo Broadcasting Corporation, for $225,000. WGZS switched their calls to WEEL on February 20, 2007, a couple of days earlier than planned. Gale launched an oldies music format known by the branding \\"Oldies 700, The Big Wheel\\" on that frequency on March 1, 2007, at 5:45 a.m. Gale hosted the station's morning show from 6a.m. to 9a.m. Afterward, Kevin Larkin hosted from 9a.m. to 2p.m., followed by Chris Morgan from 2p.m. to 7p.m. The trio used the collective name \\"The Good Guys\\" on-air. On August 3, 2007, WEEL's broadcast signal and webstream fell silent. The reason listed on the FCC \\"Remain Silent Authority\\" application was \\"financial\\". On January 30, 2008, the station applied for an extension to the remain silent authority, still citing financial problems, with a statement that they expect to resume operations in 60 days, but no specifics were mentioned as to how the station was going to solve its financial problems.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1230365&Service;=AM&Form;_id=910&Facility;_id=23614 The station returned to the air on May 5, 2008, but this would last just 10 days. On and off Following another period of silence beginning on May 15, WEEL returned to the air on August 1, 2008. The station resumed its format of oldies music. In addition, Jalo Broadcasting acquired an FM translator on 100.1 megahertz (W261AT) allowing WEEL to provide 24/7 service to its city of license. Logo used during \\"The Wheel\\" branding. In April 2008, Jalo Broadcasting Corp. reached an agreement to sell WEEL to Dothan Broadcasting, Inc., for just under $250,000. The deal was approved on June 9, 2008, and the prospective owners were operating the station under a local marketing agreement but the transaction was ultimately not consummated and the station license and assets stayed with Jalo Broadcasting Corp. On July 25, 2008, Jalo Broadcasting signed an option to sell WEEL and its translator to veteran broadcaster Bob Mathers. Mathers resigned his position as anchor and editor for KOMO (1000 AM, \\"Newsradio\\") in Seattle to take over WEEL operations on September 2, 2008. Mathers also handled morning drive and Dothan radio veteran Tom O'Brien was operations manager. The station promoted itself as \\"Oldies Radio, The Wheel\\". The station fell silent again on August 3, 2009, again citing \\"financial\\" reasons. The FCC granted the station temporary authority to remain silent on January 7, 2010. WEEL, formerly simulcasting in Dothan on its translator frequency 100.1 FM 24 hours a day, sold its translator (W261AT) to WOOF in late January 2010. In November 2009, Jalo Broadcasting Corp. filed an application with the FCC to transfer the WEEL broadcast license back to Victory Broadcasting Company, LLC, in exchange for forgiveness of certain debts and other considerations. The FCC approved the deal on January 11, 2010, and the transaction was consummated on February 18, 2010. WCNF era Gem AM branding Under the resumed ownership by Victory Broadcasting Company, the station changed call signs once again on March 2, 2010, this time to WCNF. The station, silent since August 2009, returned to the air on July 6, 2010, with a Christian radio format as \\"Praise 700\\". The station fell silent again on October 6, 2010, citing \\"financial concerns\\". The FCC granted the station temporary authority to remain silent on December 7, 2010, with a scheduled expiration date of June 7, 2011. In January 2011, WCNF was listed with CMS Station Brokerage as \\"for sale\\" and \\"priced to sell quickly\\". The station, while dark, changed its branding to \\"Gem AM\\". In late May 2011, Victory Broadcasting Corporation, LLC, contracted to sell WCNF to James Ricky Carter's Alarado Media, LLC. The FCC approved the sale on July 12, 2011, and the transaction was formally consummated on July 14, 2011. The station resumed regular broadcast operations on September 11, 2011. In November 2011, the station began airing a mix of sports talk, news, conservative talk, and agricultural information branded as \\"700 The Farm\\".

While they are there, the cousins challenge an ancient law by sleeping in a fairy mound. That night the King of Faeries, Finvara, comes to take them away. Since he is King of Dreams, he comes to them in their sleep and asks them to come with him. Findabhair says yes, but Gwen refuses. Therefore, since he is bound by an ancient law, the King only takes Findabhair, leaving Gwen to wake up wondering about her cousin's safety. Gwen decides to rescue her cousin from her fate, only to find she is happy. Gwen does not want her to stay with the faeries because they are immortal, partying teenagers. As Gwen tries continuously to find the Faeries, which is hard for her since the King is hindering her, she meets many good friends, including a middle-aged businessman, a farm girl, a king (who becomes her boyfriend) of an island, called Island Island, and even befriends the second in command of the Faeries, Midir. When she finally catches up with the faeries fast pace, she learns that either her cousin or her must be the sacrifice to an evil ancient creature known as Crom Cruac, the Great Worm, supposedly the serpent from the Garden of Eden. Her cousin voluntarily chooses to be the sacrifice, upsetting Gwen and the King of Faeries, who has fallen in love with her. In the end, with the help of many friends, Findabhair decides not to be sacrificed, but to be the first person ever to fight the serpent. With their friends by their sides, Findabhair and Gwen attack the serpent after being equipped for battle by the Land of Light, but after a while Findabhair gets blasted with poison from the serpent and falls unconscious with her life on the edge. The King of Faeries, in a desperate act of love, gives himself up as the sacrifice. He is greatly mourned, and Midir becomes king. The friends decide to meet again in a year. After a year, they meet again at Island Island and reminisce. Then they suddenly hear music. As they search for the source of the music, they find the king, alive. The worm had only taken his immortality instead of killing him, and now the faerie was mortal and without memory. They understand that it's going to be hard for the king, because of his loss. But overjoyed as they are, they promise to explain everything to him.  Cultural references  \\"The Hunter's Moon\\" contains numerous literary and culture references.

In 1843 when he was a child, his family moved north to Oberlin, Ohio, where he later attended Oberlin College. He became involved in abolitionist and antislavery activities, and participated in the successful Oberlin-Wellington Rescue. Copeland joined John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, was captured, convicted of murder and conspiracy to incite slaves to rebellion, and hanged on December 16, 1859. There were 1,600 spectators. Life Copeland's parents were John Anthony Copeland, who was born into slavery in 1808, near Raleigh, North Carolina, and Delilah Evans, born a free black in 1809. Copeland Sr. was emancipated as a boy about 1815. As a young man, he married Evans and they lived near Hillsborough, North Carolina, until 1843, when the family fled racial persecution, first to Cincinnati, Ohio, and then to Oberlin. Some of his wife's brothers and their families also settled there. The Copelands lived on the southeast corner of Professor and Morgan Streets. The son became a carpenter and briefly attended Oberlin College. His high quality of literacy and self-expression was demonstrated by later letters to his family (see below). As a young man, he became involved in the Oberlin Anti-Slavery Society. Together with his maternal uncles, Henry and Wilson Bruce Evans, in September, 1858, Copeland was one of the thirty-seven men involved in the incident known as the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue, to free John Price, a runaway slave who had been captured and held by authorities under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. The men freed the slave and helped him escape to Canada. In a negotiated deal between state and federal officials, only two men were tried for their part. They received light sentences, in part due to Charles Henry Langston's eloquence. In September 1859 Copeland was recruited to John Brown's armed group by his uncle and fellow raider, Lewis Sheridan Leary. Brown led twenty-one followers, sixteen white and five black men, and captured the armory guards of Harpers Ferry, then part of Virginia, where they took control of the Federal arsenal. The raiders were soon pinned down by Virginia militiamen until U.S. marines led by Robert E. Lee arrived to apprehend them. Copeland's role in the Harpers Ferry assault was to seize control of Hall's Rifle Works, along with John Henry Kagi, a white raider. Kagi and several others were killed while trying to escape from the Rifle Works by swimming across the Shenandoah River. Copeland was captured alive, taken in the middle of the river. Copeland, Brown, and five others were held for trial by the state of Virginia. At the trial, Copeland was found guilty of murder and conspiracy to incite slaves to rebellion and sentenced to death by hanging.Steven Lubet, The \\"Colored Hero\\" of Harper's Ferry: John Anthony Copeland and the War Against Slavery (Cambridge University Press, 2015) p.181. Copeland wrote to his family to make meaning from his sacrifice. Six days before his execution, he wrote to his brother, referring to the American Revolution: > And now, brother, for having lent my aid to a general no less brave [than > George Washington], and engaged in a cause no less honorable and glorious, I > am to suffer death. Washington entered the field to fight for the freedom of > the American people - not for the white man alone, but for both black and > white. Nor were they white men alone who fought for the freedom of this > country. The blood of black men flowed as freely as the blood of white men. > Yes, the very first blood that was spilt was that of a negro...But this you > know as well as I do,...the claims which we, as colored men, have on the > American people.Copeland was referring to Crispus Attucks, an African > American in Boston and the first person killed in the American Revolution. Another letter reflected the religious influence of his Oberlin upbringing. In a December 16 letter, Copeland wrote to console his family: The letters were circulated beyond the family to the abolitionist public. Speaking of Copeland, the trial's prosecuting attorney said: Death 125px Copeland was executed at Charles Town, West Virginia, (then part of Virginia) on December 16, 1859. On his way to the gallows he reportedly said, \\"If I am dying for freedom, I could not die for a better cause. I had rather die than be a slave.\\"Smith, Robert C. (2003). Encyclopedia of African-American Politics, p. 50. Facts on File, Inc. Copeland's parents appealed to Gov. Henry Wise of Virginia to claim their son's body, but he refused. After the execution, medical students dug up the bodies of Copeland and his fellow raider Shields Green and took them to a Winchester Medical College anatomy laboratory for training dissections. This was according to laws at the time that allocated bodies of criminals to medical schools. Professor James Monroe of Oberlin College, a friend of the Copelands, went to Virginia on behalf of the family to try to reclaim Copeland's remains. He found Green's instead and left it there.Franny Nudelman, John Brown's Body: Slavery, Violence, & the Culture of War, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004, pp. 40-45 and 66-69, accessed 17 January 2011\\"John Copeland: A Hero of Harpers Ferry\\" , WCPN Radio, Aired February 21, 2001 (text and audio versions) accessed May 20, 2007. \\"We visited the dissecting rooms.

Political career  McBride won Australian Labor Party preselection for The Entrance in the 1991 state election, losing to Liberal incumbent Bob Graham by 116 votes. However, due to the late completion of the 1991 redistribution, hundreds of voters received absentee ballots for Gosford. As a result, the Court of Disputed Returns ordered a by-election for 1992, which was won by McBride. In 2003, McBride was appointed Minister for Gaming and Racing and, in 2005, appointed Minister for the Central Coast. As Minister for Gaming and Racing, in 2005, he proposed a ban on Dutch beer Shag, claiming its name was offensive to Australians.

McBride held both Ministerial positions until a controversy arose during 2006, when he was accused of wasting $50,000 on an overseas trip in November 2005. It was alleged that McBride was accompanied by former Gosford City Councillor, Daniel Cook and his former chief of staff (and son of former Police Minister Paul Whelan) John Whelan.

It lasted between 30 January and 15 February 1658, ending with a decisive victory for Swedish King Charles X Gustav during his first Danish war. Denmark declared war on Sweden on 5 June 1657, while the latter at the time was under heavy pressure in the wars against Poland and Russia. Although Charles X Gustav was deeply involved in the conflict with Poland, he chose to move the bulk of his army to Jutland and invade Denmark. The king's rapid marches surprised the Danish troops and the main part was forced to retreat to the fortress of Frederiksodde, which was attacked and conquered by the Swedes on 27 October. With Jutland secured, Charles X Gustav sought to continue his campaign towards Copenhagen on Zealand, but he was obstructed by both the Danish straits and the Danish navy. Since the 17th century was the coldest century during the Little Ice Age, with the winters in Scandinavia being exceptionally cold, the king planned to take advantage of the weather by staying in Jutland until a sufficiently amount of ice could support the weight of his troops, to then carry out a risky march across the ice. After investigating the ice conditions, the king began his march on 30 January 1658 from Jutland across the icy strait of Little Belt to Funen. Swedish troops defeated the Danes at Tybrind Vig and Iversn√¶s, and the Swedes occupied Funen after a few days. To avert the risk that the Swedish troops would be isolated on Funen, Charles X Gustav investigated the possibilities of crossing the ice across the Great Belt to Zealand. When the ice condition at southern Funen was deemed sufficiently thick, the king decided on 5 February to cross the ice to Langeland. He then continued through Lolland and Falster and reached Zealand on 11 February. When Swedish troops stood 22 kilometers outside of Copenhagen on 15 February, King Fredrik III of Denmark chose to make an unconditional peace with Sweden, ending the Swedish campaign. Charles X Gustav's gamble ended with a catastrophic defeat for Denmark, leading to a highly favorable peace treaty for Sweden at Roskilde on 26 February 1658. The result of the peace agreement was that Denmark ceded Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bohusl√§n, Bornholm and Tr√∏ndelag to Sweden; the latter two were returned to Denmark in 1660 after Charles X Gustav's failed attempt to defeat Denmark completely in a second war. In its historiography, several historians have highlighted the campaign and the resulting peace treaty as the events that gave Sweden its current \\"natural\\" borders. Likewise, the events gave rise to a lengthy discussion regarding the role of quartermaster general Erik Dahlbergh in the king's decision to march across the Great Belt. Background In 1655, King Charles X Gustav started a campaign against Poland to force King John II Casimir Vasa to renounce all claims to the Swedish crown, as well as to conquer the Polish provinces of Courland and Prussia. The Swedish empire would be expanded, while the control of the lucrative Baltic Sea trade would be strengthened. But the war against Poland was slow. Despite several tactical victories on the battlefield, including the conquest of Warsaw, Charles X Gustav was unable to bring the war to an end. The Poles resisted the Swedish troops, who were constantly ambushed by Polish guerrilla units. In addition, Poland's neighbors threatened to get involved in the war. Both Austria and the Netherlands sent military aid to Poland, and Sweden's former ally, Brandenburg, chose to change sides during the conflict. In 1656, Russian troops had crossed the border into Swedish Livonia and besieged Riga. In 1657, Denmark was ready to attack Sweden, seeing an opportunity to tear up the Treaty of Br√∂msebro signed on 1645, when they were forced to cede the provinces of Gotland, Saaremaa, J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen, including Halland for a 30-year long period, to Sweden. But the Danish command, led by King Frederick III, realized that they were not strong enough to confront Sweden on their own. Denmark tried to gather allies from Poland, Austria, and the Netherlands, and thus the situation developed during the summer of 1657 seemed very advantageous from a Danish point of view. On 5 June 1657, the Danish food marshal Christian Wiborg handed over the formal Danish declaration of war to governor Erik Stenbock in Halmstad, later reaching Charles X Gustav's field camp in Thorn on 20 June. The Swedish army was deeply involved in the wars against both Poland and Russia, and the Danes were able to use this to put further pressure on Sweden. During the increasingly precarious situation emerging around them, Charles X Gustav and his advisers sought a suitable solution to the Polish conflict. A war with Denmark opened such an opportunity, as a quick victory would strengthen Sweden's position, and hopefully to dissuade other powers, mainly Austria, from deeper involvement in the Polish conflict. Campaign in Jutland and the assault on Frederiksodde Contemporary chalcography of the assault on Frederiksodde on 24 October 1657. Charles X Gustav sought to avoid ending up in a second stalemate, in a protracted war without a decisive opportunity in sight. Indeed, this idea was intensely pertinent to the king during the time he led his army through rapid marches from Poland, through Pomerania and towards Jutland. The king's army numbered about 17,000 men, of which only 4,000 were Swedes while the majority were foreign mercenaries. The move to Jutland went quickly; already on 25 august, the Swedish army stood outside the fortified Danish fortress of Frederiksodde on the east coast of southern jutland. By then, smaller Danish forces had been defeated along the way, but no military decision had been reached, and the Danish leadership felt secure in their belief that Frederiksodde would protect the Danish islands. The war also took place on other fronts. Swedish troops under Per Brahe and Gustaf Otto Stenbock fought the Danish troops garrisoned in Scania and Halland, as well as in Bohusl√§n and J√§mtland during the so-called Krabbefejden (\\"The Krabbe feud\\" named after Danish military officer Iver Krabbe). After the inconclusive battle at M√∏n during the autumn of 1657, the Swedish navy returned to their base in Stockholm for winter break. The Danish navy also prepared to disarm before the winter. Both parties seemed to agree that the stalemate would persist during the cold months. But Charles X Gustav knew that the Swedish army found itself in a vulnerable situation in Jutland, deeming it important to make quick actions and regain the initiative of the war. On 24 October 1657, Frederiksodde was unexpectedly assaulted by a determined Swedish force led by field marshal Carl Gustaf Wrangel. The fortress fell and the entire Danish garrison surrendered, involving several of the Danish army's best regiments, and marshal of the Realm Anders Bille was captured and died a few weeks later. As the Swedes now controlled all of Jutland, the fall of Frederiksodde was deemed disastrous for Denmark, who now lost the lock to the Danish islands. During the period after the assault on Frederiksodde, the Swedish command felt insecure, fearing an attack from Brandenburg against Swedish Pomerania and then against the army stationed in Jutland. It was urgent to force Denmark on its knees to prevent the war from turning against them as well, hence the Swedes set an assault on Copenhagen as their main objective. But to get there, they needed to find a way across to the island of Funen. The Danish troops on the island understood that an invasion attempt was imminent. Ice investigations along the Little Belt Map of the Danish Islands between Jutland and Scania. The task of preparing a detailed plan for the crossing was delegated to Carl Gustaf Wrangel, who would also prepare for possible Danish landing attempts on Jutland. On 9 January 1658, Charles X Gustav held a military conference in Kiel with his senior officers and civilian officials, including Wrangel, count palatine Philip Florinus of Sulzbach and margrave Charles Magnus of Baden-Durlach. The main alternative for disembarking on Funen was with the ship major T√∂nnes Specht's small squadron of five warships from Wismar, which in mid-December 1657 assembled in S√∏nderborg, seizing several transport ships from Vendsyssel and Sams√∏ carrying grain to L√ºbeck. But the ice cover came closer and closer, though it was uncertain whether the entire cavalry could be transferred across the strait. The ice spread quickly and the cold persisted; within a few days the ice had spread as far as one could see. Getting across to Funen with transport ships was now unthinkable if the transportation would take place that year. Now there was only one possible alternative left: an ice march across the Little Belt, the strait between Jutland and Funen. During the conference, several participants reported ice formations along Jutland's east coast, at Assens' ferry, at Haderslev, and at Flensburg. Between 22 and 23 January, Charles X Gustav sent orders to several military commanders to investigate the ice around Funen and find a way across to √Ür√∏ and on to Funen and Langeland. On 24 January, Wrangel reported that he went on horseback along the coast from Kolding to Frederiksodde and that the water was completely open. The army command deliberated about a good vantage point from a good distance south of Frederiksodde and cross the ice towards the √Ür√∏ strait at Assens on Funen. Swedish scouts rode out on the ice east of √òsby and spotted Assens, but they made the assessment that the ice was still too weak to cross. Another reconnaissance patrol was dispatched from Als towards √Ür√∏, but they established that the strait was open and was filled with ice floes. On the morning of 26 January, a Swedish patrol of five men crossed the ice to Brands√∏, 2 kilometers from Jutland at the height of Middelfart. On the island, they were surprised by 15 Danish horsemen; four of the Swedes were captured and one managed to escape and report the incident to Wrangel. He immediately sent adjutant general Friedrich von Arensdorff with 50 horsemen and 150 infantry units to the island. On the evening of 27 January, Arensdorff returned and reported that the Danish horsemen abandoned Brands√∏ and fled back to Funen across the ice. The distance between Frederiksodde and Funen was at its narrowest point just over 4 kilometers, while its widest at 17 kilometers. Charles X Gustav ordered the occupation of Brands√∏ with 100 men, later reinforced with additional 300 men. On 28 January, Wrangel marched with the cavalry out of Frederiksodde to Hejls close to Hejlsminde Bay, where the rest of the cavalry arrived on 29 January. Then they would start the ice march from a place between the villages of Anslet and Knudsh√∂fft, six kilometers south of Hejls. On 28 January, Charles X Gustav reached Haderslev and received reports from Wrangel about his route map. The king approved his plan, giving Wrangel permission to begin the march, despite the king not arriving there with his troops, though provided that the ice was deemed efficiently thick. On 29 January, the king arrived at Hejls, where Wrangel had not begun his march as of yet. Later that day, a detachment of between 500 and 600 troops were sent to the ice to scout the road to Funen. The force reached the foreland of Iversn√¶s on the other side of the strait, which was occupied by Danish troops. These had constructed two redoubts and additional fortifications and ordered Danish farmers to create a moat by tearing up the ice close to the shore. At the same time, a strong current was discovered at the shore, creating a broken ice channel along with the current. The Danes bombarded the Swedish force with their cannons, who they spotted on the ice for a couple of hours before returning to Jutland. On the evening of 29 January, quartermaster general Erik Dahlbergh was dispatched to test the ice on the narrowest strait at Middelfart. During a nighttime observation, Dahlbergh found the ice sufficiently thick for an entire army to cross, and raced back to the king with his report. But Charles X Gustav already decided that the army would cross the ice towards Iversn√¶s, ordering his troops to prepare for march the following morning. During the night, he dispatched troops to build bridges with boards and straw across weaker ice sections and gaps beyond Brands√∏. Reconnaissance patrols were sent both north and south of Iversn√¶s to take measurements of the strong current. The Swedes would cross the ice in a relatively scattered formation, to minimize the risk of the ice breaking under them, creating a dilemma as the Danes on Funen could quickly locate and strike the approaching Swedish isolated units. Order of battle=Swedish army On the Saturday morning of 30 January, Charles X Gustav moved out with his army to Brands√∏. Then the army was lined up on the ice. According to some sources his troops numbered between 6,000 and 7,000 men, according to others up to 12,000 men. The cavalry was grouped into two wings. Carl Gustaf Wrangel together with lieutenant general Clas Tott led the right wing with 1,500 men, while the left wing with 2,300 men was under the king's command. But as the king moved back and forth between the units, major general Fabian Berendes held the direct command of the left wing. The infantry under the command of lieutenant general Jakob Kasimir De la Gardie advanced behind the cavalry and would take a different and longer route across the ice, while carrying both the artillery and baggage train, so they were unable to take part in the battle against the Danes. All units would converge at Tybrind Vig north of Iversn√¶s, approximately 5 kilometers from Brands√∏. More than 40 Swedish regiments would advance towards Funen. Due to battle casualties and disease, some had merged into groups of a few dozen men, while others amounted to 500 men or more. The Drabant Corps, the king's elite guards marched at the head of the cavalry. The cavalry consisted of the Sm√•land, Uppland, V√§sterg√∂tland and √ñsterg√∂tland cavalry regiments. From Finland came Fabian Berende's dragoons from √Öboland, Henrik Horn's cavalry from Tavastia, and cavalry from Turku and Pori Province under the command of colonel Gustaf Kurck. The infantry consisted of the H√§lsinge, Kalmar, Kronoberg, N√§rke-V√§rmland, Skaraborg, S√∂dermanland and Uppland regiments. They were spearheaded by the Life Guards, where Swedish guardsmen were mixed with several hundred enlisted German soldiers, who filled the ranks of the regiment since it was severely decimated during a plague when they were garrisoned in the Polish city of Thorn. Danish army Ulrik Christian Gyldenl√∏ve. At the time, disorder and shortcomings arose among the Danish troops. Their commander was Ulrik Christian Gyldenl√∏ve, half-brother of King Frederick III with little experience as a military commander. The Danes lacked experienced Danish military officers, and the cohesive command link was broken as several officers came from the Netherlands, France, Scotland, and the German states. The Danes had a severe shortage of clothes, food and grain, since large stores previously sent to Frederiksodde ended up in Swedish hands. The Danish units were forced to be garrisoned in towns and villages around Funen, quickly consuming all the surplus provisions stored there. Sailors were put ashore from the Danish warships, but these were poorly dressed and had their feet frozen. The lack of fodder in Funen meant that several horses on the island died of starvation, which forced a cavalry regiment from Zealand to leave their horses during their transportation to Funen. Gyldenl√∏ve had roughly 5,000 men scattered throughout the island. Of these, 3,000 were cavalry units, while the rest were infantry units and conscripted peasants. Given the problems spreading across the island, the actual strength was largely on paper. Furthermore, Gyldenl√∏ve became ill and unable to ride a horse, which resulted in him being forced to transfer command to major general Jens von L√∏wenklau. About 4,500 men were stationed at Iversn√¶s, of whom 1,500 were conscripted peasants. L√∏wenklau established his headquarters in Wedellsborg seat farm near Iversn√¶s. March across the Little Belt=The battles at Tybrind Vig and Iversn√¶s On the morning of 30 January, the Danes located the Swedish vanguard, consisting of 400 cavalry units under colonel Casper Borneman, who rode out against Tybrind Vig. Borneman was accompanied by 200 detached dragoons who on sleds carried beams, boards, ladders, barrels, and straw to build bridges across gaps and weaker ice sections. After their discovery, the Danes dispatched some of their units from Iversn√¶s to Tybrind Vig, where they clashed with Swedish reconnoiters. The church bells rang across Funen, warning that the Swedes were on their way. The Swedish soldiers put straws on their hats as a sign of identification, and handed out the password: \\"Help, Jesus!\\". March across the Little Belt and the battle of Ivesnaes 1658. Painting (1693) by Johann Philip Lemke. Wrangel's wing began their march across the ice. Charles X Gustav halted his wing as a tactical reserve in case the Danes would conduct a counterattack across the ice against the Swedish baggage train on Brands√∏. Such an attack never came, and later the left wing under the king and Berendes moved out to the ice. Of nine Danish cavalry companies guarding Funen's coastline from Middelfart to Langeland, three to four were ordered to immediately move northward towards Iversn√¶s. These, however, failed to arrive on time. Borneman's vanguard rode to Tybrind Vig, encircled the beach, and tore up Hannibal Sehested's Danish cavalry regiment. Danish reinforcements arrived quickly from Iversn√¶s, observed by the king out on the ice. He decided to unite his cavalry wing with Wrangel's units, giving each other equal support during their landing on Funen. The Danish cavalry lined up in battle formation on both sides of the small infantry force and the artillery at their disposal. Charles X Gustav tried to make a two-side attack from the ice and on land. Wrangel was ordered to make a straight attack with parts of his wing on the beach towards the Danish front. The other half of his wing was transferred to a northward path towards the king's wing. They rode ashore on Ruds cape north of Tybrind Vig, and under the cover of a forest, they encircled and striked the Danes from the north and east. While Wrangel's wing rode towards the shore, the ice broke up in patches behind them, and two cavalry squadrons from Waldeck's and K√∂nigsmarck's German regiments disappeared into the water. The ice cracked under the king's hunting sled, and the whole crew, his personal bodyguard and three draft horses fell into the water and drowned. The king, however, already left his sled and mounted on a horse to lead the attack on the shore. Battle of Iversn√¶s. Chalcography (1658) by Erik Dahlbergh. During the battle, Danish major general von Ahlefeldt spotted Charles X Gustav and aimed his cannons towards him. Several cannonballs hit the ice in front of the king's horse, and a cannonball threw up debris that lightly damaged the king's left eye. Dahlbergh rode by his side and survived unscathed. When the king shortly afterwards rode up to a small hill to monitor the Swedish cavalry attacks, he was surrounded by a few Danes, but Dahlbergh quickly gathered support to drove them off. Wrangel was under heavy pressure by the Danes, which Charles X Gustav detected and sent Tott with Uppland Cavalry Regiment to reinforce him. The Swedish attack on the beach and around the Danish line of defense became successful, and the Danish line of defense collapsed. von L√∏wenklau realized that his troops would be crushed between the two Swedish wings. He rode up to Wrangel, whom he knew from before, and demanded quarters, which was granted to him and his soldiers. The battle was over by ten o'clock in the morning. Of five Danish cavalry regiments lined up along the shore, only two remained intact after the short battle. An unknown number of Danish soldiers were killed, but the majority surrendered and were captured. The Swedish losses during the battle were relatively small, apart from Waldeck's and K√∂nigsmarck's squadrons who fell through the ice. The king's gamble succeeded through an operation that took only a few hours to accomplish. Charles X Gustav now established his bridgehead on Funen and unit after unit arrived on solid ground, including the artillery and the baggage train. A large part of the cavalry moved inland to pursue the scattered Danish troops fleeing the battle. The peasant assembly at Iversn√¶s broke down as Swedish units under Tott attacked them from Tybrind Vig. Several peasants were cut down before most of them surrendered to the superior Swedish forces. Occupation of Funen Little and Great Belts. When news of the successful Swedish landing spread across the island, the Danish resistance was broken. Smaller Danish units in various places around Funen surrendered, or the soldiers simply returned to their homes. A few Danish cavalrymen crossed the ice to Zealand, after stealing property from farmers or looting the Danish crown's stashes of collected tax funds. On Saturday evening, major Sylcke and 150 Swedish cavalrymen from Wittenberg's cavalry regiment rode into Odense. The city was unfortified and guarded by a small Danish cavalry force under the command of colonel Steen Bille, who could be disarmed after a short battle. Gyldenl√∏ve was also in Odense, who was captured along with Danish officials Iver Vind, J√∂rgen Brahe, Gunde Rosenkrantz and Henrik Rantzau. On 31 January, Swedish troops captured Nyborg without a fight and captured official Otte Krag and several senior Danish officers. Large parts of the Danish government thus fell into Swedish captivity. The officers were sent to prison camps in Frederiksodde, while some higher-ranking Danes were allowed to keep their swords and move freely around Funen. After reaching Funen, another Swedish unit under colonel Rutger von Ascheberg moved north and entered Middelfart. At Hindsgavl's Castle, 2 kilometers north of Middelfart, 450 German mercenaries in Danish service under major general Hindricksson surrendered. The mercenaries chose to transfer into Swedish service, while the Swedes captured 60 cannons and a significant amount of ammunition and provisions. Further south, Assens was captured and plundered by a Swedish infantry unit. Dahlbergh was dispatched south with a company of √ñsterg√∂tland Cavalry Regiment under rittmeister Claes Niethoff. They spent the night in F√•borg, and reached Svendborg on 31 January, which had been taken by Berendes and his two Finnish regiments. Berendes had previously surprised four Danish cavalry companies arriving from Langeland to Funen's defense. The Danes retreated after a short battle. On the evening of 31 January, Wrangel's cavalry unit reached Nyborg, after completing a fifty-mile long rapid march across Funen. Despite Nyborg being strongly fortified, the Danish garrison surrendered without offering any resistance. Only four frozen Danish ships with its crews under the command of vice admiral Peter Bredal remained untouched. Wrangel sent major Christer Lillieberg to Bredal to persuade him to surrender, but Bredal chose to fight. Swedish troops lined their cannons along the shore, and the Swedes and the Danish ships bombarded each other for a couple of days. On 2 February, the Danish sailors managed to saw up a gap in the ice, and they were then able to pull the ships out of range of the Swedish cannons and sail back to Copenhagen. Hence ending the hostilities on Funen. Aftermath and peace offer Following the landing at Tybrind Vig, Charles X Gustav went to the village of Esk√∏r, becoming a gathering point for the Swedish units. The king refused to wait for the infantry and artillery, who were still marching out on the ice, but ordered their commanders to march south after their landing and secure Assens. The king himself broke camp from Esk√∏r with the cavalry. He arrived at K√∏ng, where Dahlbergh established the Swedish units' night quarters and the royal company was accommodated in a vicarage belonging to vicar Henning Clausen Bang. There, Charles X Gustav held a council of war with Wrangel, the margrave of Baden-Durlach, the Danish defector Corfitz Ulfeldt and some other senior officers. The deliberations were mainly about a possible march towards Zealand. On 31 January, the king arrived in Odense, where he was received by bishop Laurids Jacobsen Hindsholm, mayor Thomas Brodersen Risbrich and several priests and civil servants. The king accommodated and spent the night in mayor Risbrich's manor on Overgade no. 11 in Odense, but on 1 February the king moved to the monastery pf Dalum. The vicar in Dalum, Niels Bang, had his vicarage plundered by Swedish horsemen, who let themselves be accommodated there. From the monastery, Charles X Gustav sent letters with the news of the successful conquest of Funen to Duke Frederick III of Holstein-Gottorp, Philip Florinus of Sulzbach, and Mathias Bi√∂renclou, the Swedish minister in Frankfurt am Main. These recipients spread the message to England's ambassadors in The Hague and Paris. The French ambassador Hugues Terlon participated in the campaign, writing a 13-page long report in Dalum which he sent to cardinal Jules Mazarin in Paris. News of the march across the Little Belt and the collapse of the Danish defense spread across Europe. On 1 February, Copenhagen was reached by the news of the loss of Funen, which according to its English ambassador Philip Meadows sent shock waves through the capital's inner circles. On 3 February, King Frederick III wrote a proposal for a ceasefire and promising English mediation for a peace between Sweden and Denmark. During the following weeks, Meadow worked diligently to create peace between the countries, as the war affected the trade in the Baltic Sea, including Skagerrak and Kattegat, and a further escalation could result in a major war involving Austria, Brandenburg, England and France. The peace offer was sent on 4 February by one of Meadow's envoys to Nyborg, where the envoy was received by Wrangel, who forwarded him to the king's quarters in Odense, where he arrived during the evening the same day. Ice investigations along the Great Belt Corfitz Ulfeldt (1653) by S√©bastien Bourdon. The conquest of Funen opened interesting opportunities for the Swedish army, as did the conquest of the fortified city of Nyborg, which was the lock to the Great Belt, the strait between Funen and Zealand. There they also seized hundreds of Danish cavalry horses that were abandoned on the ice by the shoreline. The cavalrymen from three Danish squadrons had left their horses and then continued on foot across the Great Belt, probably to Sprog√∏. Other Danish cavalrymen fled southeast across the ice to Langeland, and therefore, information circulated that the ice carried all the way to Lolland. The king immediately ordered extensive investigations into the bearing capacity of the ice at various locations on the Great Belt. As his troops advanced across Funen, the Swedish units were concentrated in Nyborg and Svendborg, both of which were the starting points for a probable continued march across to Zealand and Lolland, respectively. Outside Nyborg, adjutant general Arensdorff and lieutenant colonel Georg Henrik Lybecker investigated the ice condition to Kors√∏r on the Zealand side. Erik Dahlbergh led the investigations along the Svendborg route through Langeland and across to Lolland. Through their superiors Wrangel and Berendes, the king received continuous reports about the ice condition. On 1 February, Wrangel reported to the king about a rumor that the ice could carry them all the way out to T√•singe between Funen and Langeland. The king was eager to cross the ice to Langeland, but he began to despair after receiving reports that the current between Langeland and Lolland obstructed the ice formation. The frost had now taken hold of the Danish islands, and on 2 February Lubecker was able to report that the ice between Nyborg and Sprog√∏ was sufficiently strong, but on the other side of Sprog√∏, the ice was too thin to carry an entire army. On 3 February, Charles X Gustav moved from Dalum back to the mayor's manor in Odense. Since 1 February, the king was impatiently waiting for a report from Berendes and Dahlbergh about the ice condition across to Langeland. Erik Dahlbergh led the ice investigations along the Great Belt. He depicted these events in his diary and letters, where he greatly magnified his own efforts. Painting by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl. From the Danish side, Dahlbergh carried out careful investigations of the ice. On 2 February, fleeing Danish cavalrymen arrived from Funen to the fortified town of Nakskov on Lolland, reporting that they spotted a Swedish patrol on Langeland. The next day, Nakskov's commander received news that Swedish troops were inspecting the ice condition from Langeland to Lolland. Dahlbergh received his order from Charles X Gustav on 31 January, and escorted by 200 Finnish cavalrymen under colonel Claes Uggla, Dahlbergh crossed two ice-covered straits and reached Longelse church on Langeland on 2 February, 80 kilometers from his starting point on Funen. There, Uggla regrouped with the main part of the cavalry, while Dahlbergh and 40 cavalrymen under Niethoff crossed the 13-kilometer-wide Great Belt and arrived ashore at Grimstedt's mansion. A Danish coastguard of a dozen horsemen was posted there, who withdrew while one of them was captured, in addition to two farmers who were intercepted, and Dahlbergh transported the prisoners across the Great Belt as living proof of their crossing. On the way back, Dahlbergh took several drilling samples of the ice at Rudk√∏bing on Langeland and inspected a Swedish unit on √Ür√∏. On the evening of 4 February, while the king received the proposal for a ceasefire from the English envoy, Dahlbergh returned to Odense and reported that the ice condition in Lolland was good. The king decided to immediately go to Nyborg to consult with Wrangel and Corfitz Ulfeldt. The king arrived in Nyborg at two o'clock on the night of 5 February. It was stated in the morning that the ice condition became more uncertain in this section. Several Swedish patrols testing the ice at Kors√∏r fell through but managed to save themselves from drowning. Sudden changes in the weather obstructed the ice formation, including storms and thaw. The king then contemplated to withdraw the bulk of his army to Jutland and leave a couple of infantry regiments as an occupying force on Funen, concentrating around Odense. On the same day, he considered starting negotiations with King Fredrik III and appointed Ulfeldt and council member Sten Nilsson Bielke as his delegates to deliberate with the Danish counterpart, steward of the Realm Joachim Gersdorff and council member Christen Skeel. He suggested that the Swedish and Danish delegations should meet in Rudk√∏bing on 13 February, alternatively on Sprog√∏. At the same time, Swedish patrols were dispatched to investigate the ice towards Falser, Langeland, and Lolland, who reported that the change of weather had not affected the ice condition in the southern part of the Great Belt. Towards the end of the afternoon on 5 February, Charles X Gustav finally decided that the army would march through Langeland towards Lolland. Accompanied by Ulfeldt, the king left Nyborg at the head of all available cavalry regiments. Wrangel was left with the infantry and remained in Nyborg. The king moved quickly to Svendborg, where earlier on eleven o'clock in the evening, a Swedish patrol of 60 men returned from Grimstedt on Lolland. The patrol looted the mansion and rode back in a closed formation at full trot and gallop, bringing a few Danish prisoners. Despite the weather began to change drastically, causing the snow to begin to melt, the ice was found to be sufficiently sustainable all the way to Lolland. With this information, the king decided to proceed according to plan. He ordered Wrangel to re-examine the ice between Nyborg and Kors√∏r. If the ice were still too thin in this section, Wrangel would immediately lead his troops south to Svendborg and cross the ice in the king's footsteps. March across the Great Belt T√•get √∂fver B√§lt (1851) by Carl Andreas Dahlstr√∂m. On the night of 6 February, the Swedish cavalry of between 2,000 and 3,000 men marched out on the ice outside of Svendborg, leading their horses by foot. Kalmar infantry regiment joined the march with 370 men. Charles X Gustav accompanied the rearguard out on the ice, ordering the margrave of Baden-Durlach to cross the ice with the bulk of the cavalry to T√•singe and continue to Rudk√∏bing. Reconnaissance patrols trotted in advance to confirm the ice condition. Several squadrons, however, disappeared on forays against the Danish farms, forcing the king to dispatch his provosts to try and gather them. When the remaining troops went out on the ice, the snow on the ice melted in such a manner that two feet of water was over the ice. Despite the water in some places reached the top of the horses' legs, the ice held for the most part. Only marginal losses occurred when miscellaneous units got lost during the dark night and disappeared through the ice. March across the Great Belt 1658. Painting by Johann Philip Lemke. On the morning of 6 February, Charles X Gustav reached Rudk√∏bing on Langeland and quickly went across the island to the ferry at Longelse Church. At noon the same day, he reached Tyear's ferry on Lolland. In the evening, Nakskov was surrounded by a Swedish cavalry regiment under colonel Overbeck. A Swedish trumpeter was sent to Nakskov and called on the Danish garrison (equipped with 40 guns) of 150 men, including 75 men from Svend Poulsen's dragoon squadron, and 1,500 conscripted peasants, to surrender. Although the commander, colonel Franciscus Edmond, refused to surrender, the morale in the garrison waned and the local bourgeoisie took matters into their own hands. The burghers assaulted the conscripted peasants on the wall and disabled the cannons. On the night of 7 February, the bourgeoisie opened the city gates and sent a delegation handing over the keys of Nakskov to Ulfeldt. He was the king's representative, since the latter passed Nakskov and advanced quickly with the bulk of his army. On the morning, a Swedish troop entered the city, captured the garrison, and disarmed the conscripted peasanty and ordered them home to their farms. Svante Ban√©r was appointed commander and received 600 men to form a garrison. On the same day, 600 Danish soldiers were on their way to Nakskov to strengthen the Danish garrison, but they stumbled upon a Swedish cavalry unit who captured them. The king spent the night at Oreby Farm and on 8 February he marched across Saksk√∏bing and Guldborgsund to Falster. Concluding that he was unable to cross the ice from Nyborg, Wrangel marched to the king's starting point in Svendborg, bringing 3,000 men, of which 1,700 infantry, 1,000 cavalry and 200 artillerymen with 16 guns. On the morning of 7 February, Wrangel broke camp from Nyborg and after a ten-hour rapid march, he arrived at Tranek√¶r Castle on Langeland. On February 8, Wrangel crossed the Great Belt, on a more northerly route than the king, and later arrived at Halsted Priory on Lolland, where he struck camp for the night. On 9 February, Wrangel continued to Saksk√∏bing, where he received the king's permission to let his exhausted troops rest until 10 February. On the afternoon of 11 February, Wrangel's troops were reunited with Charles X Gustav's at V√•lse. Following the forced and risky march across the ice, Charles X Gustav rested his troops for two days. The units were brought together, and in his camp at V√•lse he commanded 5,000 cavalry, 2,500 infantry and about 20 field guns. On 11 February, the king broke camp with his reconnoiters and moved across Gr√∏nsund and the islands of Bog√∏ and Far√∏ to Zealand, capturing Vordingborg and continued on. The king rode northward of Zealand with a vanguard of 600 horsemen and stumbled upon ambassador Meadows and the Danish negotiators Gersdorf and Skeel. The king returned to Vordingsborg and began the peace talks later that day, but he seeked to continue his march to put further pressure on the Danes. On 12 February, the entire Swedish army broke camp from V√•lse and reached Pr√¶st√∏ the same day. On 13 February, Swedish units moved into K√∏ge, which had been abandoned by the Danish troops. A one-day stalemate took place to scout their surroundings. On 15 February, Swedish units passed K√∏ge tavern and reached Torslunda Magle, only 22 kilometers from Copenhagen, while the Danish troops withdrew. Since 5 February, the garrison of Copenhagen consisted of 4,000 cavalry, 1,200 infantry and 2,000 sailors, including 3,000 armed citizens. Despite their numerical superiority, the morale in the capital waned as well, and on the evening of 15 February, Charles X Gustav received a message from ambassador Meadows that Frederick III was increasingly pressured and was ready to negotiate on everything and had no limited conditions. Charles X Gustav ordered his army to halt and focused more on the peace talks. Treaty of Roskilde Celebration in Frederiksborg Castle to the Treaty of Roskilde. Painting (1658) by Erik Dahlbergh. The final negotiations took place in Roskilde, and on 26 February, the final peace treaty was signed in Roskilde Cathedral. The Swedish military advantage was massive and Swedish troops occupied almost all of Denmark. But at the same time, Charles X Gustav was in a hurry to sign for peace before other states would intervene to aid Denmark. Therefore, the Swedish conditions were reduced step by step. The result was still a disaster for Denmark, who was forced to cede the provinces of Blekinge, Bornholm, Bohusl√§n, Scania and Tr√∏ndelag, as well as her claims to Halland, to Sweden. Further conditions included heavy war reparations to the Swedish state, Danish renunciation of all anti-Swedish alliances, and Danish provision of troops and warships to serve Charles X Gustav in his broader wars. On 1 March, a Swedish expeditionary force of 2,000 men under Clas Tott left Zealand and sailed to the Scanian coast. The troops seized the Scanian fortresses and the Danish garrisons were sent to the ports of √ñresund to be transported back to Zealand. Drafted Scanian soldiers were disarmed and sent home to their farms. On 5 March, after staying in Frederiksborg Castle as Frederick III's personal guest, Charles X Gustav went to Helsing√∏r and with Frederick III's royal ship sailed across to Helsingborg, where he was received by archbishop Peder Winstrup and the Scanian clergy. On 9 March, Charles X Gustav held his entrance in Malm√∂, where he received an oath of allegiance by the Scanian nobles, priests, burghers, and peasants. On 13 March, field marshal Axel Lillie marched from Kalmar with 500 men into Blekinge and captured Kristianopel on 15 March. On 18 March, Erik Stenbock and major general Harald Stake entered Bohusl√§n from V√§sterg√∂tland and captured Bohus Fortress. At the end of April, governor-general Johan Printzensk√∂ld landed on Bornholm with 100 men and four cannons, and on 10 May, the city of Trondheim was transferred to the governor of Falun, Lorentz Creutz, and the future Swedish governor, Claes Stiernsk√∂ld. Second Dano-Swedish war In the months following the Treaty of Roskilde, tension around Charles X Gustav accumulated on other fronts. Sweden was still at war with Poland, Russia, Austria and Brandenburg, and the king feared an allied attack aimed at tearing up the Roskilde treaty. He decided to prevent such an attack by declaring war on Denmark as early as 5 August 1658, with the aim of vanquishing Denmark as a sovereign state, divide the country into four governments, and seize the revenues of the Sound Dues. Following the signing of the Roskilde treaty, Swedish troops were still occupying the Danish islands, except on Zealand, which Charles X Gustav took advantage by landing in Kors√∏r on 6 August 1658 with 5,200 men. On 6 September of the same year, Kronborg was captured and earlier on 11 August, Charles X Gustav began a siege of Copenhagen, with the aim of starving the city's inhabitants into submission. This plan failed when the Netherlands joined the war to aid Denmark, and the united Danish and Dutch fleets defeated the Swedish fleet in the battle of the Sound on 29 October, after which the Dutch were able to deliver supplies to the Copenhagen citizens. The Swedish siege continued, however, and culminated in a decisive Swedish assault during the night between 10 and 11 February 1659, ending in a Danish victory. An army of troops from Brandenburg, Poland and Austria then attacked the Swedish troops in Jutland. The Swedes withdrew to Funen and after the battle of Nyborg on 14 November 1659, the Swedes were forced to surrender. At the beginning of 1660, Charles X Gustav became seriously ill, and died on 13 February in Gothenburg as a result of pneumonia. The great political scene changed with his death. Sweden signed the Treaty of Oliva on 23 April 1660 with Poland, Austria, and Brandenburg. In the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May the same year, Bornholm and Tr√∏ndelag were ceded back to Denmark, while Sweden kept all territories east of the Sound. Analysis In his book 1658: t√•get √∂ver b√§lt, Swedish historian Lars Ericson Wolke explained that there were several factors as to why Charles X Gustav emerged victorious from his first war with Denmark. On paper, the armies of Denmark and Sweden were relatively equal, though with a certain predominance within the Danish army and navy. But compared to the Danes, the Swedish army was more combat-experienced, and its command was significantly more determined and ruthless. From a purely strategic and operational point of view, Charles X Gustav's decision to launch a campaign against Denmark was an unreasonable one, since he had not finished his ongoing campaign in Poland. But for the king and the Swedish command, Denmark was a higher priority than Poland, and the march towards Jutland gave Sweden an opportunity to withdraw from what they called the \\"Polish swamp\\" with their honor intact. From the moment the Swedish army marched up to Jutland, they gained the initiative in the war. Now the Swedes acted, while the Danes reacted. The Swedes constantly pushed the Danes through new and surprising moves, never giving the Danish command time and peace to plan and execute their own moves. When the ice condition in the Belts twice helped the Swedes out of difficult situations, the pressure against Denmark increased even further. In addition, the Danish intelligence service suffered from serious shortcomings, even though the fighting took place in the heart of their own kingdom. The Danes was repeatedly having a very vague view of the Swedish army, both in terms of its size and its exact location, causing escalating uncertainty within the Danish command. Furthermore, Frederick III and his advisers constantly hoped that the Netherlands, perhaps even Austria and Brandenburg, would come to their aid at the last minute. Also in this regard, the Danish command harbored a fruitless hope. The end result was that the constant Swedish pressure, paired with a failed Danish intelligence service, led to panic in the Danish defense first on Funen, later on Lolland and Zealand, which in a very logical way led to the \\"panic peace\\" treaty of Roskilde. Once back, and before deciding to march across the Belts, Charles X Gustav and his army faced a looming catastrophe, as the army was isolated and could face an imminent encirclement should an Austrian-Polish army attack its back. If the ice on the Great Belt had not settled, the king's army would have been captured in the middle of the Danish kingdom without the opportunity to escape on their own. The king's decision succeeded in averting the impending catastrophe, much thanks to a combination of luck and boldness. The same can be pointed out about the ice marches themselves, when two cavalry squadrons fell through the ice on the Little Belt and drowned. If the bulk of the army would have perished, the posterity would probably have condemned Charles X Gustav and his advisers for the decision to cross the ice, a decision which in that instance would have had devastating consequences for Sweden as a great power in Europe. This did not occur, however, and a potential catastrophe turned into a huge military success which in turn resulted in the most profitable peace treaty Sweden has ever signed. For Denmark, the peace treaty became a disaster that severely mutilated the kingdom. Aftermath The march across the Belts, including the resulting Roskilde Treaty, has long been conpared a success story in Swedish history, as well as an admirable achievement since Charles X Gustav and the Swedish army carried out the campaign with relatively few losses as a result. During the age of romantic nationalism in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Charles X Gustav was highlighted as the king who gave Sweden its current and \\"natural\\" borders. The campaign has triggered a prolonged discussion among historians, partly about the issue whether Charles X Gustav's war policy was to the benefit or detriment of Sweden as a whole, and partly about Erik Dahlbergh's role in the decision-making process regarding the Swedish army's march across the ice. The decision itself, however, has rarely been discussed or questioned, despite its crucial importance for the future of both the Swedish empire and its army. Equestrian statue by John B√∂rjeson of Charles X Gustav on Stortorget in Malm√∂. The first historian to portray the campaign and Charles X Gustav's actions was the historical writer Samuel von Pufendorf in his work De rebus a Carolo Gustavo gestis (The feats of Charles X Gustav), which was commissioned by Charles X Gustav and completed for print in 1696. Pufendorf used various sources to describe the course of events, including reports from Hugu Terlon and Philip Meadow and notes written by Swedish secretary Edvard Ehrenst√©en. According to these, it was Charles X Gustav who was the driving force and who made the final decision in the campaign, sometimes contrary to the warnings of his advisers. According to Pufendorf, Charles X Gustav was the lone hero and the Treaty of Roskilde was the king's sole merit. The depiction of the circumstances surrounding the decision-making process both in Frederiksodde and on Funen became complicated as Erik Dahlbergh's autobiography and excerpts from his diary were printed in 1757 and 1785, respectively. In both of these works, Dahlbergh highlighted his own role in the king's decision to cross the Great Belt; it was his ice investigations, including the fact that he personally presented the report on the ice conditions to the king, that ignited the king's decision-process, and thus became the driving force behind the king's decisive decision. In the resulting deliberations in Nyborg, it was Dahlbergh who persuaded the king to venture out on the ice, while Wrangel and Corfitz Ulfeldt rejected this. In 1786, Carl Gustaf Nordin wrote a biography of Erik Dahlbergh, stating that \\"in Dahlbergh's words, the march across the Belts took place; and without it, Sweden would have been a few provinces smaller, and the world would have one less heroic act to admire\\". In his book series Ber√§ttelser ur Svenska historien (Stories from Swedish history), Anders Fryxell criticized the heroic image of Charles X Gustav, viewing the king's war policy morally unjust. Fryxell was rebuked by Wilhelm Erik Svedelius, who in 1844 believed one could not place moral values on the actions of a statesmen, conparing that the good of the state was synonymous with the morally good. Fryxell gave his response in 1855, comparing Charles X Gustav's attack on Denmark in 1658 with Russia's attack on Sweden in 1808, with the latter leading to the loss of Finland. Equestrian statue by Theodor Lundberg on Kungstorget in Uddevalla depicting Charles X Gustav with Erik Dahlbergh by his side. Erik Gustaf Geijer stated that Erik Dahlbergh was \\"the foremost instigator\\" behind the king's decision to cross the Belts. Following Geijer, several Danish and Swedish historians made the same assessment of Dahlbergh's role, including Ernst Ericsson, but some, as emphasized by Curt Weibull, highlighted Ulfeldt's role in the campaign. This approach was mainly expressed by Julius Albert Fridericia and Fredrik Ferdinand Carlson, the latter in 1855 emphasized how Wrangel and Ulfeldt argued against a march across the ice and almost convinced Charles X Gustav to call of his campaign until Dahlbergh, in a single deliberation, persuaded the king to change his mind. Carlson regarded Charles X Gustav as the man who gave Sweden its natural borders, and as an early proponent of Scandinavism whose war policy strived for the unity of and prosperity for the entire Nordic region. Though he rejected calling Charles X Gustav a proponent of a united Scandinavia, Fredericia was of the same opinion as Carlson that \\"it was Erik Dahlbergh whose council came to decide the fate of the Nordic nations\\". The decision-making process behind the march across the Belts was critically examined by Gustaf Bj√∂rlin in 1921. Bj√∂rlin highlighted the source- critical weaknesses in Dahlbergh's diary and memoirs, which were released long after the course of the depicted events, when the author got his facts straight and had an apparent need to promote his own career, emphasizing his previous exploits in the service of the dead king. Later in Dahlbergh's life, he became one of Sweden's most powerful servants and military commanders, which, according to Bj√∂rlin, stimulated his need to polish his early career. Bj√∂rlin stated that Dahlberg \\"created his story without any witnesses\\", since it was not possible to prove the validity of Dahlbergh's reports based on other sources. Bj√∂rlin's examination of Dahlbergh's writings were ignored by later researchers' and authors' depictions of the campaign. It was not until 1948 that Curt Weibull acknowledged Bj√∂rlin's argument when he, during his lecture before a Nordic history seminar in Lillehammer, rejected Dahlbergh's writings, labeling them sentient stories without any factual historical value. Furthermore, Weibull emphasized that it was Ulfeldt who played an important role in the king's decision to cross the Belt. Weibull was opposed by several researchers and the debate continued when he returned to the subject in an essay in 1954. Weibull was supported by Hans Villius, who critically examined Dahlbergh's depictions regarding the Danish wars in his reports. Furthermore, in his book N√§r Sk√•ne blev svenskt (When Scania became Swedish) from 1958, author Alf √Öberg considered Dahlbergh's stories very unreliable as sources and that he had, in all probability, exaggerated his own role in the campaign. Weibull's and Bj√∂rlin's views of the events had a strong impression on other researchers since the 1950s, when the so-called \\"Weibull School\\" in the 1940s and 1950s dominated Swedish historiography. Arne Stade, however, was not convinced by Weibull; in 1957, Stade conpered that in Dahlbergh's presentations one could still find \\"the real and psychic reality\\" that hides behind the dramatized depiction of how the decision on the ice march was made. Stade's view was expressed in a large research project on Charles X Gustav, conducted by the historical department of the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College between 1965 and 1979. In addition, some researchers once again wanted to attribute a certain source value of Dahlbergh's writings, despite their source-critical weaknesses. In the book Den o√∂vervinnerlige (The Invinsible) from 2000 by Peter Englund, Dahlbergh is portrayed as having a certain influence on the decision-making process that took place on Funen. In the popular science genre, the march was depicted in Carl Grimberg's book Svenska folkets underbara √∂den (The Wonderful Fates of the Swedish people), which from the 1910s and many years later dominated many Swedes' view on history, and where Charles X Gustav is praised for his bold action. In Grimberg's and Hugo Uddgren's book Svenska krigarbragder (Feats of Swedish warriors), depicting the campaign in the chapter titled \\"En bragd utan like i v√§rldshistorien\\" (A feat without equal in world history), Carlson's view was emphasized that the Roskilde treaty \\"along with the Br√∂msebro treaty, was the most valuable peace treaty our country has ever fought for, because both of them together gave Sweden, still to this day, its preserved natural borders\\". Memorials and cultural references Medal struck by Pieter van Abeele commemorating the campaign. Already after the campaign ended, both the war and the campaign were depicted by the poet Georg Stiernhielm in his work Discursus Astropoeticus, which, however, was not a traditional heroic tribute to the campaign. It was not until the 18th century when attempts were made by Swedish lyricists to create a classic epic poem. Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht wrote the poem T√•get √∂fver B√§lt in 1754, in which she depicted the events of Charles X Gustav's reign as a result of a play by supernatural forces. She competed with her poem in the Royal Academy of Letters' first prized competition, though she did not win an award. The academy's secretary Olof von Dalin was accused of deliberately withholding the poem from Queen Lovisa Ulrika and the members of the academy. In 1785, Gustaf Fredrik Gyllenborg published the poem T√•get √∂fver B√§lt. Nor Nordenflycht's and Gyllenborg's work was successful with the general public. Arnold Munthe wrote the play T√•get √∂fver B√§lt, which was staged on 12 February 1920 at the Royal Dramatic Theatre with Tor Hedberg as director. Concurrently with the Nordic industrial and handicraft exhibition in Malm√∂ in 1896, an equestrian statue depicting Karl X Gustav was erected on Stortorget in the city. The statue was created by John B√∂rjeson and the driving force behind its construction was politician Carl Herslow along with historian Martin Weibull, who gave the ceremonial speech on 28 June 1896. Weibull highlighted Charles X Gustav's long-term attempt to unite the Nordic peoples already in the 1650s. In 1908, the 250th anniversary of the Roskilde Treaty was celebrated in Malm√∂. In 1915, Theodor Lundberg's statue depicting Charles X Gustav accompanied by Erik Dahlbergh was inaugurated on Kungstorget in Uddevalla. A statue of the king created by Gustaf Malmquist was also planned in Stockholm, and after a lengthy process mainly due to the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian union, an equestrian statue was inaugurated in front of the Nordic Museum building on 6 June 1917. Malmquist's statue received aesthetic criticism from August Brunius in Svenska Dagbladet, with novelist Hjalmar S√∂derberg suggesting that the statue should have been melted down into emergency coins. Recently, B√∂rjeson's statue in Malm√∂ has been a subject of discussion among the city's residents and municipal politicians. The campaign has been depicted both in paintings and in chalcography. War artist Johann Philip Lemke and Carl Andreas Dahlstr√∂m portrayed Charles X Gustav and his army on the ice in dense, square formations, when in reality, they were spread several meters apart and led their horses by foot. Lemke made these paintings using Erik Dahlbergh's drawings or engravings and under his supervision. Lemke's paintings are displayed in the gallery of Charles X Gustav in Drottningholm Palace. Gustaf Cederstr√∂m made a painting unveiled in 1912 in the stairwell of the House of Nobility, depicting Charles X Gustav on horseback with Dahlbergh showing the way across the ice-covered Great Belt on foot. After the Treaty of Roskilde, Charles X Gustav struck a medal, created by Johan Georg Breuer, with the inscription in Latin: \\"Natura hoc debuit uni\\" (\\"This aid nature was obliged to give to a single man\\"). Other medals commemorating the campaign have been struck by Pieter van Abeele and Arvid Karlsteen. The campaign attributed to the street name B√§ltgatan (The Belt Street) in the Stockholm district √ñstermalm, as well as in Gothenburg, Kungs√∂r, and R√•√•.

Early life and background Salvado was born at Tui, Galicia, Spain. At the age of 15 he entered the Benedictine Abbey of San Martin at Compostela. He was clothed in the habit in 1829 and took his final vows in 1832. In 1835, he was forced to flee to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, after the anti-Catholic government of Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal decreed the closing of all monasteries and the secularisation of monks as a result of the First Carlist War. He was received into the Abbey of Trinit√† della Cava, near Naples, where he was ordained to the priesthood in February 1839. Mission Strongly desiring to labour in the foreign missions, his wish was granted after John Brady was consecrated as first bishop of the Diocese of Perth. With his longtime friend Father Joseph Serra OSB, Salvado sailed from London with the bishop's party and landed in Fremantle in January 1846. At Brady's instruction, Salvado and Serra, alongside a small party of their fellow Benedictines, journeyed deep into the Victoria Plains via ox drawn cart. On 1 March 1846, they founded \\"The Central Mission\\" in the midst of the bush, intending to convert the Indigenous Australians to Catholicism. This was later renamed \\"New Norcia\\" after the birthplace of St. Benedict. The priests soon established relations with the Nyungar people, but conditions at the mission proved so harsh that soon only Salvado and Serra remained. Salvado was an accomplished musician and in the first year of the mission he travelled back to Perth and on 21 May 1846 gave a well-received piano recital in tattered robes in the hall of the courthouse. The recital raised much needed funds for provisioning the new mission.The Salvado Memoirs, Benedictine Community of New Norcia Inc, 1977 Then, in 1848, Serra was appointed Bishop of Port Essington in the Northern Territory and later to coadjutor of the Diocese of Perth. In 1849, Salvado sailed for Europe to raise funds for the mission accompanied by two young Nyungar boys, Joseph Conaci and Francis Dirimera. Salvado was consecrated Bishop of Port Essington in August that year, much against his will, as he strongly desired to return to New Norcia. After Port Essington was abandoned, however, he was left as a bishop without an episcopal see. While waiting permission to return to Australia, he wrote and published Memorie Storiche dell' Australia in March 1851. This book, which chronicled the beginnings of the mission and his relations with the Nyungar people, went through multiple printings in Italian, Spanish and French. It was published in English in 1977. Later life He returned to Australia in 1853, accompanied by a large number of priests and monks bound for the Australian missions and especially for New Norcia. For four years he administered the Diocese of Perth during Bishop Serra's absence in Europe. He returned to New Norcia in 1857. In the following years he shifted the focus of the mission to serving the White settlers who were pouring into the area. In 1866 he was nominated as Bishop of Perth, but convinced Vatican authorities that his true vocation lay with Aborigines. In 1867, he was appointed \\"Lord Abbot\\" and the mission was upgraded to an independent abbey by Papal decree. He died in 1900 at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, while on a visit to Rome. His body was returned to New Norcia three years later and buried in a tomb of Carrara marble behind the high altar of the abbey church.

It is located in the Brickell district of Downtown Miami. It was originally approved by the City of Miami and the Federal Aviation Administration in 2006 but was put on hold due to the Great Recession. The project was revived in 2012 when owner Tibor Hollo hired Moshe Cosicher, AIA Architect, to redesign the project. In 2013, the project was revised; the tower is stated to include residential, hotel, retail, and office space. It is the tallest building in Miami, and the tallest building in Florida, but may soon thereafter be overtaken by various other towers, including two of their own projects (The Towers by Foster + Partners and One Bayfront Plaza). It took over the Four Seasons Hotel Miami as tallest when it topped out in late 2017. The project is the first development in the City of Miami to be funded in part by EB-5 visas. While the entire site was technically addressed 1101 Brickell Avenue, the building is actually located on the back of the lot, behind two existing office buildings, at 1100 Brickell Bay Drive. It is about two blocks from the Tenth Street Metromover station. History Kobi Karp provided design plans for a tower at 1101 Brickell Avenue by developer Leviev Boymelgreen. It was approved by the City of Miami in 2006 and cleared by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for a maximum height of above mean sea level (AMSL) in 2005. The 849 foot (259 meter) (AMSL) building was to contain of office space, of retail as well as 650 residences. However, the project was put on hold due to the crash of the United States housing bubble. The site of the project was purchased by veteran Miami developer Tibor Hollo of Florida East Coast Realty in 2009; the US$33-million purchase price included the three acre site and existing office buildings, built in 1964 and 1985. The office buildings had very low occupancy at this time, around 30% in 2010. The building was renovated and by the end of 2012 occupancy was up to 85%. In 2011, Florida International University opened a downtown campus in the building known as FIU Downtown on Brickell; they also got the signage rights to the building. In addition to the renovation, a small glass and steel addition adjacent to Brickell Avenue was completed in 2014. Known as \\"The Cube\\", the space uses variable-tint glass and houses a TD Bank. Design In 2012, Hollo began developing plans for the project, and the name \\"Panorama Tower\\" was introduced. The height remained the same at , but the number of units was quoted at 724. Hollo revised the plans in 2013. The FAA required the height of the structure to be lowered to . In 2013 and 2014, respectively, the developers were working to ensure the building height would not be greatly reduced under the FAA's \\"emergency airspace\\" or \\"one-engine inoperative\\" policies which were proposed at that time. At this point, the building was designed to include 821 residential units and 250 hotel units, as well as approximately of retail and approximately of office space in the 13 story pedestal which would also include about 1500 parking spaces. Moshe Cosicher is the architect of record for the project and Fons Inc. was retained to work alongside for the production and construction administration of the project. In 2014, the parking pedestal, now shown as 19 stories and quoted to have 2,000 parking spaces, was reported to include of medical office space and about of retail space. The number of hotel rooms decreased to 208, and the flag was revealed to be Hyatt full service brand Hyatt Centric. The hotel would be located within 17 floors lining the east face of the pedestal. The building would be the largest building in Miami, with gross floor area quoted between and , the latter number including the existing office building. In 2016, a slight height increase to the current was sought by the developers and approved by the FAA. Interior design concept was provided by Zyscovich Architecture. Construction Site preparation began in late 2013 with the clearing of the site and demolition of an existing parking garage, with foundation work by HJ Foundation, part of the Keller Group beginning in June 2014, when California-based Tutor Perini was awarded the US$255 million contract as the main contractor. As of January 2015 the construction was said to be ahead of schedule. The continuous concrete pour for the approximately 14,000 cubic yard () raft slab required hundreds of cement trucks operating for over 24 hours from numerous factories. The approximately pour took place over a weekend in late March 2015 and was one of the largest continuous pours in Florida history. The project received a US$340 million construction loan from Wells Fargo in 2015, with construction well underway. By October 2015, construction was up to the top of the 19-story pedestal. In January 2016, the building received a temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) for the lower 11 floors of the parking garage. Users of the existing buildings had been using off-site parking in the interim. Over of the project was structurally completed, and the building was still on schedule for completion in late 2017. During the first half of 2016 a height increase to was approved; this may affect the floor count, which was at least 81 actual floors at the level. Other than the Renaissance Center in Detroit and Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel in Atlanta, both hotels, it would be the only building over to stick to a total floor-to-floor height of no more than . Hotels, parking garages, and condos generally have much less floor-to-floor height than high-rise office towers. However, very few towers of any kind over 50 floors keep to an overall height under per floor, due to increased ceiling heights or the need for mechanical floor levels, rooftop HVAC, housing for the tops of elevator shafts, spire details, or other infrastructure. It is unclear whether the floor count will remain at 82, or increase to 85 due to the height increase. DeSimone Consulting Engineers is serving as structural engineer on the project. The firm has designed numerous supertall towers and skyscrapers worldwide, and frequently works with top architects and developers on marquee projects globally. On March 24, 2017, the same week the building officially surpassed the height of the Four Seasons Hotel Miami, a small fire broke out on the 68th floor just before 7 pm. It was extinguished within hours, with no injuries or delay to the project's timeline. The cause was not immediately known. No work was underway when the fire broke out. With a topping out in April, the 208-room Hyatt Centric hotel in the pedestal is expected to open in the third quarter of 2017, with the building to open by the end of the year.

Financing In 2014, the building became the first development in the city of Miami to be accepted into the EB-5 visa program. When the application was submitted in late 2012, it was stated that this immigrant investment system could fund about 15% to 20% of the project. However, later estimates were placed lower despite high demand that was exceeding the limit of 10,000 visas per year (throughout the country). With a very high Walk Score, Panorama Tower is in the class of apartment buildings that have seen the most increase in value over time even into a market slowdown in 2017.

Biography He was born in Burlington, North Carolina on February 6, 1924. In 1942, Wiggins enrolled in Campbell College, which was 70 miles from his home. In 1943, he was pressed to serve as a Marine in the Pacific during World War II. After returning to Campbell in 1947, he went on to receive his Associate of Arts degree. He also met the love of his life, Mildred Harmon, and married her on April 14, 1948. By 1950, he had earned a Bachelor of Arts (magna cum laude) from Wake Forest College. In 1952, he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (cum laude) from Wake Forest College School of Law. In his lifetime, he did achieve Master of Law and Doctor of the Science of Law from Columbia Law School. On June 6, 1967, Wiggins became president of what was then known as Campbell College. He would remain in the position until 2003, when he retired at 79 and was honored with the title of chancellor. During his tenure, his passionate leadership inspired the establishment of five professional schools, which led to Campbell College's transformation to a university in 1979. Campbell now enrolls roughly 10,000 students, making it one of the largest Baptist universities in the country. Wiggins died in a Winston-Salem hospital of complications from lymphoma. He had taken a short leave as university president in 2001 after being diagnosed with that form of cancer. He was survived by Millie Wiggins, his wife of more than 50 years.

They were usually the first to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Although not much is known about them today, it is believed that they were the backbone of the Persian army who formed a shield wall and used their two- metre-long spears to protect more vulnerable troops such as archers from the enemy. The term is also used to refer to the combination of these shield- bearers and the archers that were protected by them. The Persian variant of sparabara: nine rows of archers protected by one row of shield-bearers equipped with spear. The earlier Assyrian army used a tactical formation of one row of archers protected by one row of soldiers equipped with shields. The Persian formation was a modification of this arrangement; nine rows of archers would be protected by one row of shield-bearers. The Persian shield-bearers were further equipped with short spears to increase their effectiveness. The Sparabara were taken from the full members of Persian society, they were trained from childhood to be soldiers and when not called out to fight on campaigns in distant lands they practised hunting on the vast plains of Persia. However, when all was quiet and the Pax Persica held true, the Sparabara returned to normal life farming the land and grazing their herds. Because of this they lacked true professional quality on the battlefield, yet they were well trained and courageous to the point of holding the line in most situations long enough for a counterattack. They were armoured with quilted linen and carried large rectangular wicker shields as a form of light manoeuvrable defense. This, however, may have left them at a disadvantage against often heavier armoured opponents such as the hoplite, and his two- metre-long spear was not able to give the Sparabara ample range to engage a trained phalanx with their longer 6-9 feet dory. The wicker shields may have also been not as effective as thicker wooden shields in prolonged melee combat. However, the Sparabara could deal with most other infantry, including trained units from the territories around the Persian empire. The sparabara were supposed to be used in conjunction with Persian heavy cavalry and chariots, which would attack from the rear. An example in which the cavalry failed to be engaged is the Battle of Marathon, which had catastrophic results.

Depending on the jurisdiction, the insurance premium can be either mandated by the government or determined by the insurance company in accordance to a framework of regulations set by the government. Often, the insurer will have more freedom to set the price on physical damage coverages than on mandatory liability coverages. When the premium is not mandated by the government, it is usually derived from the calculations of an actuary based on statistical data. The premium can vary depending on many factors that are believed to affect the expected cost of future claims. Those factors can include the car characteristics, the coverage selected (deductible, limit, covered perils), the profile of the driver (age, gender, driving history) and the usage of the car (commute to work or not, predicted annual distance driven).IVS 1 - Market Value Basis of Valuation, Seventh Edition History Conventional methods Bauer, Alan Rex; Burns, Kurtis Tavis; Esposito, Michael Vincent; Huber, David Charles JR.; O'Malley, Patrick Lawrence; \\"Monitoring system for determining and communicating a cost of insurance\\", January 2004 for determining costs of motor vehicle insurance involve gathering relevant historical data from a personal interview with, or a written application completed by, the applicant for the insurance and by referencing the applicant's public motor vehicle driving record that is maintained by a governmental agency, such as a Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Such data results in a classification of the applicant to a broad actuarial class for which insurance rates are assigned based upon the empirical experience of the insurer. Many factors are deemed relevant to such classification in a particular actuarial class or risk level, such as age, sex, marital status, location of residence and driving record. The current system of insurance creates groupings of vehicles and drivers (actuarial classes) based on the following types of classifications. *Vehicle: Age; manufacturer, model; and value. *Driver: Age; sex; marital status; driving record (based on government reports), violations (citations); at fault accidents; and place of residence. *Coverage: Types of losses covered, liability, uninsured or underinsured motorist, comprehensive, and collision; liability limits; and deductibles. The classifications, such as age, are further broken into actuarial classes, such as 21- to 24-year-olds, to develop a unique vehicle insurance cost based on the specific combination of attributes for a particular risk. For example, the following information would produce a unique vehicle insurance cost: *Vehicle: Age - 7 years old; manufacturer, model - Ford, Explorer XLT; value $18,000 *Driver: Age - 38 years old; gender - male; marital status - single; driving record (based on government reports) violations - 1 point (speeding); at fault accidents - 3 points (one at fault accident); place of residence 33619 (zip code) *Coverage: Types of losses covered; liability - yes; uninsured or underinsured - no; motorist comprehensive - yes; collision - yes; liability limits - $100,000/$300,000/$50,000; deductibles - $500/$500. A change to any of this information might result in a different premium being charged if the change resulted in a different actuarial class or risk level for that variable. For instance, a change in the drivers' age from 38 to 39 may not result in a different actuarial class because 38- and 39-year-old people may be in the same actuarial class. However, a change in driver age from 38 to 45 may result in a different premium because the records of the insurer indicate a difference in risk associated with those ages and, therefore, the age difference results in a change in actuarial class or assigned risk level. Current insurance rating systems also provide discounts and surcharges for some types of use of the vehicle, equipment on the vehicle and type of driver. Common surcharges and discounts include: *Surcharges: Business use. *Discounts: Safety equipment on the vehicle airbags, and antilock brakes; theft control devices passive systems (e.g. The Club), and alarm system; and driver type - good student, and safe driver (accident free); group - senior drivers fleet drivers . Usage-based insurance Conventional rating systems are primarily based on past realized losses and the past record of other drivers with similar characteristics. More recently, electronic systems have been introduced whereby the actual driving performance of a given driver is monitored and communicated directly to the insurance company. The insurance company then assigns the driver to a risk class based on the monitored driving behavior. An individual, therefore, can be put into different risk classes from month to month depending upon how they drive. For example, a driver who drives long distance at high speed in one month might be placed into a high risk class for that month and pay a large premium. If the same driver drives for short distances at low speed the next month, however, then he or she might be placed into a lower risk class and charged a lower premium.

The of trails in the Preserve cross rolling foothill terrain covered with grassland, California oak woodland, California mixed evergreen forest, and chaparral. History=Mount Diablo Coalfield Historic marker for Mt. Diablo coal field In 1859 William C. Israel discovered a coal deposit while clearing out a spring on his land at Horse Haven Valley, six miles south of Antioch. His initial attempt to mine the coal was not financially successful but soon other coal deposits were discovered nearby and mining operations grew rapidly. The area became known as the Mount Diablo Coalfield, the largest in California, producing more than 400 million short tons (357 million long tons) of coal during this time. The area includes the remains of twelve coal mines and the sites of several long-gone coal mining towns. The Preserve contains over of mine workings. The largest and oldest town, Nortonville, had a peak population of about 1,000. Somersville, Stewartville, West Hartley and Judsonville were located in valleys to the east. The sites of Stewartville and West Hartley are located on private property outside the eastern boundary of the Preserve. The mines were the Empire, Central, Star, Corcoran, Pittsburg, Manhattan, Eureka, Independent, Union, Black Diamond, Mt. Hope, and Cumberland. The coal produced was of a low grade (sub-bituminous or lignite), but for a time in the 19th century, was the only readily accessible and economic source in California. Therefore, it was a very valuable resource and powering the railroads, ships and heavy industry of California. The mineral was often called 'black diamond.\\" Erickson, Ger. \\"Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve.\\" 2017. Accessed February 22, 2017. The coal was carried to the San Joaquin River by three railroads: the Empire, Pittsburg, and Black Diamond, for shipment by barge to markets in San Francisco, Sacramento, Stockton and other communities. Coal mining activity ended as better-quality imported coal became affordable and as petroleum emerged as an energy source. After the coal mines closed, the towns were abandoned and the area was used mainly for cattle grazing. In 1974 the Southport Land and Commercial Company (former Black Diamond Coal Mining Company) donated 160 acres of its land holdings to help It become Black Diamond Mines Regional Park. The coal mines are closed due to hazards posed by the age of the mines, the gases they produce (carbon dioxide and methane), and their rock quality (the shale and coal in the mines is unstable). In 1980 four young boys from the local area were killed by the methane gas from one of the open mines However, a number of mine openings have been turned into public- access openings which allow visitors to look into the mines and, for some, to walk a short distance underground. The deepest public-access opening is known as Prospect Tunnel. Visitors can enter of this excavation made by miners searching for coal. Rose Hill Cemetery Rose Hill Cemetery Rose Hill Cemetery, officially designated as a Protestant cemetery, the final resting place for over 200 residents of the coalfield, is located on a hillside between the Somersville and Nortonville townsites. After the mines closed and the nearby towns were abandoned, the cemetery fell into disuse. Many of the gravestones were stolen or destroyed by vandals. In 1960, Ansel Adams photographed two Italian Cypress trees in the cemetery, and called the image,\\"Poplars, Cemetery near Mount Diablo\\".Pohl, Michael. \\"Rose Hill Cemetery #007.\\" Michael Pohl Photography. May 21, 2017. Accessed September 2, 2018. The photo was taken with a Polaroid camera, though it's possible that it was not a typical consumer camera model. The land the cemetery occupies was originally owned by the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company and was given to Contra Costa County by Emma Rose, the daughter of Black Diamond Mining Company president Alvinza Hayward. The original records for the cemetery were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. Few people buried in the cemetery are identified. Many of the individual plots were never marked. More had only a wooden marker - nearly all of which were destroyed over the years by either wildfires that swept through the area or by insects, weather, or other natural cause. Vandals are said to have carried off some of the more permanent stone markers. A few whose earthly remains were laid to rest here include: * William Gething, age 36, who was killed with 9 other men in an 1876 explosion; 7 other men who died at the same time are buried nearby. * Sarah Norton, age 68, wife of Noah Norton (namesake of Nortonville), who also worked as a midwife and was killed instantly when she was thrown from her buggy to deliver yet another baby; she reportedly delivered over 600 babies for miners' wives. * The earliest stone marker belongs to Elizabeth Richmond, who died in February, 1865. * The youngest known person was the one-day old, unnamed daughter of Thomas H. and Elizabeth Jenkins, who died on April 15, 1880. * The oldest known person was Ruth French, age 81, died on September 11, 1874. * The most recent known burial was William T. Davis, died in 1954. Sandstone mine Inside the Hazel-Atlas Mine at Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve In the 1920s, a mine producing high-quality silica sandstone was started by owner Marvin Greathouse on a hillside above the Somersville townsite. He sold the product to the Hazel-Atlas Glass Company which operated a plant in Oakland manufacturing glass containers. Hazel-Atlas eventually purchased the mine and operated it until about 1945. Another sandstone mine in the Nortonville area produced sand used by the Columbia Steel mill in Pittsburg, California for steel casting. The two companies recovered more than of sand between from the 1920s to the 1940s. The Hazel-Atlas mine is being restored and maintained by park staff and can be visited on guided tours which cover the area's mining history and geology. Greathouse Portal, Black Diamond Mine Regional Preserve in 2012 Inside the Greathouse portal, a -long section of the entrance corridor has been made into a museum. The first section is a series of self-guided exhibits, while the larger second section (which has a separate entrance from the outside), houses a reconstruction of the Hazel-Atlas works as it would have appeared around 1940.\\"Sand Mine Underground Visitor Center.\\" RoadsideAmerica.com Accessed February 22, 2017. EBRPD originally repurposed the Hazel-Atlas mine as a museum in the 1970s, but storm damage in 2007 forced closure of this attraction for extensive repairs. It did not reopen for five years.

Recreation The trails offer views of Mount Diablo, the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, and on clear days, the Sierra Nevada. The Preserve usually has an impressive variety of wildflowers in spring including the rare Mount Diablo fairy lantern (Calochortus pulchellus), Mount Diablo sunflower (Helianthella castanea), and Brewer's dwarf flax (Hesperolinon breweri). It is home to a variety of wildlife including deer, mountain lions, coyotes, foxes, bobcats, golden eagles, and a variety of hawks. The endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) and threatened California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii), California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and Alameda whipsnake (Masticophis lateralis) are present as well. The park is open year- round for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding from 8 am to dusk. A backpack camp and a group camp can be reserved for overnight stays. There have been many reports of a ghost in the park. 2016 land donation EBRPD accepted the donation of by Antioch Holdings LLC on December 20, 2016. The property had been deeded to the holding company by Gordon Grevelle, president of Suncrest Homes, who had originally planned to build a gated residential community there when he had bought the tract in 1987. After going through an extensive permitting process and a decline in the California housing market, Grevelle decided that the project he had envisioned would be unlikely to meet his financial goals. Since the tract was already surrounded by park land, he chose to make the land available to EBRPD, which announced its intention to add the land to the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. Grevelle estimated the market value of his donation at $3.5 million in 2016.Coetsee, Rowena. \\"Black Diamond Mines park 50 acres larger.\\" Brentwood News. December 30, 2016.

Dubbed in 1965 as \\"Ohio's Singing Ambassadors of Goodwill\\" by Governor James A. Rhodes, the group is composed of singers from many of Ohio's 88 counties. A portion of the group also engages in a tour of Ohio during the summer.  History The All-Ohio Youth Choir was founded in 1963 by Glenville D. Thomas. He created the group after directing the Greater Zanesville Youth Choir from 1959‚Äì1962 and using that group as a basis for the first All-Ohio Youth Choir, which performed for the first time at the 1963 Ohio State Fair. This gave high school vocalists the opportunity to share a musical experience that rivals that of the All-Ohio State Fair Band. In 1965, 122 members of the Choir embarked on the group's first European tour, following a day of performances at the New York World's Fair. In 1969 The choir appeared on the then locally broadcast \\"The Phil Donahue Show\\", which was filmed live during the State Fair. Once during the year, the Hollywood comedian/actor, Bob Hope, acted as a guest conductor for the singing of The Battle Hymn of the Republic. In 1971 the choir performed in the Rose Garden, for then President Richard Nixon and appeared on The Phil Donahue Show with Maria von Trapp to sing selections from The Sound of Music. In 1974 and 1975 the Choir was invited to perform in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. They used a custom-made portable amplification systems for each singer, known as \\"Voice-Paks\\", allowing the choir to become the first known marching choir. In 1975, the choir went to Hollywood with the first trips to the Tournament of Roses Parade; they returned in 1978, and for the final time in 1988. In 1982, the choir participated in the Fiesta Bowl Parade. In 1982, the choir was the recipient of the Governor's Award at the Ohio Newspaper Association banquet. In 1992, Charles R. Snyder became the second director of the choir. He had been director of music for the Highland Local Schools in Morrow County, and then for Coshocton Middle School, and was on the staff of The Presbyterian Church, Coshocton, Ohio as minister of music and education. In 2014, Dr. Jon Peterson was appointed as the third director in the Choir's 52nd year of continuous performance. In the late early 1980s two of the Choir's European tours included concerts at West Bromwich Town Hall, (England), organised by the Sandwell Cancer Research Campaign (Chairman John Shorthouse) - the local fund-raising committee of The UK Cancer Research Campaign. In the mid 1980s The Choir performed two similar concerts at West Bromwich Town Hall, in aid of Sandwell Hospital Radio, and compered by actor, comedian & author Alton Douglas. These concerts were sponsored by Centro and Barclays Bank respectively, organized by Station Manager Ian Shorthouse, and broadcast live to hospitals in the borough of Sandwell.  Alumni Association  The Alumni Association serves as a booster club for the current choir and as an organization to keep the alumni involved and informed about the choir.

Nesbit. The film was directed by Lionel Jeffries and stars Dinah Sheridan, Jenny Agutter (who had earlier featured in the successful BBC's 1968 dramatisation of the novel), Sally Thomsett and Bernard Cribbins in leading roles. The film was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom on 21 December 1970. The film rights were bought by Jeffries. It was his directorial debut and he was also responsible for writing the screenplay for the film. The Railway Children turned out to be a critical success, both at the time of its release and in later years. Plot The Waterburys are an affluent family who live in a luxurious Edwardian villa in the suburbs of London. Charles Waterbury, the patriarch, works at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He is arrested on suspicion of being a spy. This is hidden from the rest of the family by his wife. The family become impoverished and are forced to move to a house called 'Three Chimneys' in Yorkshire, which is near Oakworth railway station. When they arrive, they find the house in a mess and rat-infested. The three children, Roberta (known by her nickname Bobbie), Phyllis, and Peter find amusement in watching the trains on the nearby railway line and waving to the passengers. They become friends with Albert Perks, the station porter, and with an elderly gentleman who regularly takes the 9:15 train. To make ends meet, their mother works as a writer and also home schools the children. Mrs Waterbury falls ill with the flu. Bobbie writes to the gentleman, who delivers food and medicine to the house to help their mother get better. They are admonished by their mother for telling others of their plight and asking for assistance. The following day, a man is found at the railway station. He speaks a language that no-one can understand. The children figure out that he can speak French, which their mother is fluent in. Mrs Waterbury discovers that the man is an exiled Russian writer who has arrived in England to find his family who had fled there. He stays with them at their house. Bobbie writes another letter to the gentleman asking him to help in finding the exile's family, who are soon found. One day, while watching the railway tracks, they notice that there has been a landslide which has partially obstructed the tracks. The children fashion their red petticoats into flags which they use to warn the driver of the impending danger. The train stops due to their warning. The railway company and villagers hold a party for the children and thank them for their actions. The children are given personalised engraved watches and are dubbed \\"The Railway Children\\". The children find out that Mr Perks, the station porter, doesn't celebrate his birthday. They secretly ask for gifts from the villagers that he has helped in the past and deliver the gifts to his house. Mr Perks initially refuses the gifts as he doesn't accept charity. However, after the children explain that the gifts are from people that he has helped over the years, he thanks them for their kindness. In return the following day, he delivers old newspapers and magazines for them to read. Bobbie reads one of the newspapers and notices a story about their father being imprisoned. She discusses this with her mother who finally discloses that their father is in prison after having been falsely convicted of being a spy and selling state secrets. She speculates that a jealous colleague of his may be behind it. Bobbie again contacts the gentleman and asks him to help her father. A group of youths are playing a game of paper chase which the children observe. One of the boys injures his leg in a railway tunnel and is helped by the children. He is taken to their house where he recuperates from his injuries. The gentleman visits their house and reveals that the boy is his grandson, Jim, and thanks the family for looking after him. Jim and Bobbie grow close during his recuperation and promise to write to each other when he departs to his home. Bobbie arrives at the railway station. She runs to greet her father who has just alighted onto the platform after being exonerated and released from prison. They return to 'Three Chimneys' and the family are reunited.

He had lost his own books and borrowed The Railway Children from his 13-year-old daughter Martha (he had two other children). He loved it, although he admitted \\"my personality is so different from the quiet romance of the story.\\" However, he said \\"I found the climate of the... story just right for me, a way in which to start entertaining people and help not destroy our industry. There are hardly any films being made for children and for middle aged and older age groups. I thought this could be one.\\" He bought a six-month option on the film rights for ¬£300 and wrote a screenplay. \\"I've kept to the story,\\" said Jeffries. \\"It would be an imposition not to ‚Äì after all, E. Nesbit's survived 50 years.\\" Jeffries succeeded in attracting financing from Bryan Forbes at EMI Films, who was interested in making family films. Forbes suggested Jeffries direct.LIONEL JEFFRIES Hayward, Anthony. The Independent 20 February 2010: 44. \\"I knew there were slight bets among the technical staff as to how long I'd last,\\" said Jeffries later. The film was part of Forbes' initial (and, it turned out, only) slate for films at EMI.In the Picture Sight and Sound; London Vol. 38, Iss. 4, (Fall 1969): 181. Jeffries later said \\"I knew we were taking a big, calculated risk in swimming against the permissive mainstream with such a story. All I could do was make it as honestly as possible: a Victorian documentary.\\" Casting Sally Thomsett was cast as the 11-year-old Phyllis, despite being 20 years old at the time. Her contract forbade her to reveal her true age during the making of the film and she was also not allowed to be seen smoking or drinking during the shoot. 17-year-old Jenny Agutter played her older sister, Roberta, and Gary Warren played their brother, Peter. Agutter had previously played the same role in the 1968 BBC Television adaptation of the story. Dinah Sheridan was cast as Mother and Bernard Cribbins as Perks the porter. Jeffries admitted he was tempted to play the role of Perks himself, but eventually decided to cast Cribbins \\"because of his lovely calm comedy.\\" Filming locations Lionel Jeffries used the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, and its station at Oakworth, as the backdrop for the film, referring to it as the \\"Great Northern and Southern Railway\\". At the time of filming, there were still very few heritage railways in Britain and only the KWVR could provide a tunnel, which is important in a number of scenes. The tunnel is a lot shorter in reality than it appears in the film, for which a temporary extension to the tunnel was made using canvas covers. A number of working locomotives were used in the making of the film, including MSC67, 5775 (L89), 52044 (preserved as L&Y; 957) and 4744 (69523/1744), all of which survive. They were painted in fictional liveries for the filming: 5775 in brown, reminiscent of the Stroudley livery of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway; 957 in apple green, similar to liveries used by the North Eastern Railway; Great Northern Railway; and London and North Eastern Railway, and 4744 and MSC67 in plain black, as used by most railway companies in Britain at one time or another. 67 is now at the Middleton Railway in Leeds and 4744 is now with the North Norfolk Railway at Sheringham. 5775 and 957 are still on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway. As of 2020, none of the locomotives are operational. Green Dragon 957 is undergoing overhaul at Haworth, which is approaching completion (and includes a repaint into the apple green livery used in the film), and 5775 is on static display at the Oxenhope Exhibition on Keighley and Worth Valley Railway having been repainted into the GN&SR; livery. 4744 is undergoing a ten-yearly overhaul in Norfolk and 67 remains at Middleton but on display, having last operated in 2012. A wide variety of vintage rolling stock was used in the film, including examples from the Metropolitan and London and North Eastern railways. Although different carriages appeared in different liveries, the dominant one is white and maroon, which is reminiscent of the livery of the Caledonian Railway. The most important carriage in the film, the Old Gentleman's Saloon, was a North Eastern Railway Director's Saloon, that has been used since in the stage production of the book. It and all the other carriages seen in the film are still at the KWVR, but tend to be used at special events only, due to their age. A number of different locations were employed for various scenes. The house called \\"Three Chimneys\\" is in Oxenhope, just north of the Oxenhope railway station. The Bronte Parsonage in Haworth was used as the location for Doctor Forrest's surgery. The scenes of the children sitting on a bridge were filmed at Wycoller, near Colne. Mytholmes Tunnel, near Haworth, and the railway line running through it, were used extensively in the film, including being the location for the paper chase scene, as well as the famous landslide scene, in which the children wave the girls' petticoats in the air to warn the train about said blockage. The landslide sequence itself was filmed in a cutting on the Oakworth side of Mytholmes Tunnel and the fields of long grass, where the children waved to the trains, are situated on the Haworth side of the tunnel. A leaflet, \\"The Railway Children Walks\\", is available from KWVR railway stations or the Haworth Tourist Information Centre. The scenes in the Waterburys' London house, before their move to Yorkshire, were filmed at 4 Gainsborough Gardens in Hampstead, north-west London.

It was one of the few financial successes of Bryan Forbes' regime at EMI Films.Walker, Alexander, Hollywood England, Harrap and Stein, 1974 p 426-432 By June 1972 it had earned EMI a profit of ¬£52,000. Critical reception Since its release, the film has received universally positive reviews and holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on nine reviews. Home media A 40th anniversary Blu-ray and DVD was released on 5 May 2010 with a new digitally remastered print. It includes new interviews with Sally Thomsett, Jenny Agutter and Bernard Cribbins. The planned commentary by director Lionel Jeffries was not completed due to his death in February 2010. Awards and nominations The Railway Children received three nominations for awards at the 24th British Academy Film Awards ceremony. Bernard Cribbins was nominated in the category of Best Supporting Actor. However, in a category also featuring John Mills, Colin Welland and Gig Young, the award went to Welland for his role in the film Kes. Sally Thomsett received a nomination for Best Newcomer in a Leading Role but again lost out to an actor from Kes, in this case David Bradley. Johnny Douglas was also nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music but the award was won by American Burt Bacharach for his film score for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Merchandise Hornby Railways produced a 00 gauge train set of the train from the film. It had a London, Midland and Scottish Railway 0‚Äì6‚Äì0 tank shunting locomotive in GN&SR; livery with Synchrosmoke, two period coaches, an oval of track and a station. Bachmann Branchline currently produces a 00 gauge train pack from the film, albeit a more accurate set. It includes a GWR 5700 Class locomotive in GN&SR;'s brown livery, two LMS Period I carriages in GN&SR;'s maroon and white livery, and a model of the Oakworth station building. In 2010, to coincide with the 40th anniversary, a book was brought out called The Making of the Railway Children by Jim Shipley ‚Äì a former volunteer station master of Oakworth Station. It detailed events that took place during filming and interviews from local people associated with it. In November 2012, a second updated version was printed with added information, in particular about Gary Warren, who disappeared in the mid-1970s after retiring from acting. He had been tracked down by a member of the official Catweazle fanclub and the author had permission to write a more updated version of what had happened to him. BBFC complaint In 2013, the British Board of Film Classification released a statement saying that they had received and evaluated a complaint about the film in that it encouraged children to trespass on the railway tracks. The BBFC noted that the children did trespass on the line, but only to warn an approaching train of the danger of a landslide on the track ahead. They had, however, in an earlier scene walked along the track simply to get to the station. The BBFC also pointed out that the film was set in Edwardian times when access to railway lines was not under the same restrictions as modern times. Legacy The film has left a lasting impression on the British film industry and audiences. In 1999, the British Film Institute (BFI) put The Railway Children in 66th place in its list of the Top 100 British films of all time. Five years later, the film magazine Total Film named it the 46th greatest British film of the 20th century. In 2005, the British Film Institute included it in their list of 'The 50 films you should see by the age of 14'. In 2008, the film made it onto Channel 4's list of the 100 Greatest Family Films at number 30, just ahead of Monsters, Inc. and just behind Men in Black and Ghostbusters. On 28 March 2010, the Bradford International Film Festival concluded with a new restoration of The Railway Children film with the 40th anniversary digital premiere. Jenny Agutter also starred in a new TV adaptation of The Railway Children in 2000 in the role of Mother. Much of the publicity for the 2000 film focused on Agutter's involvement in both films which were made a generation apart.

Born in Lincoln to middle-class English parents, he relocated to Netherfield, Nottinghamshire where his father was convinced to move the family to a ranch in Orion, Alberta. Suffering from boredom in his teenage years, Eggleston advanced his basic English education through a fast-track course at Regina College, which qualified his entrance to Queen's University in 1926. Graduating in 1928, he found journalistic work at the Lethbridge Herald before occupying his role as Ottawa correspondent for the Toronto Star by the following year, becoming parliamentary correspondent before his resignation in 1936. Joining the civil service through his productive membership of the secretariat in the Rowell-Sirois Commission of 1937, the Canadian government entrusted him with the position of Chief Censor of the nation in 1942 to combat negative coverage of Canada's role in the Second World War at home and overseas. Resigning in 1944, much to the regret of the authorities, Eggleston found work as an academic at Carleton University in 1947, establishing the Carleton School of Journalism upon accepting his lectureship; he directed the faculty until 1966. Eggleston died in Ottawa on 13 June 1986 at the age of 85. Early life Wilfrid Eggleston was born on 25 March 1901 in Lincoln to English parents who had moved from Spalding two years earlier, where his older sister Margaret had been born. His father was a former tax collector, his mother, a shop assistant and dressmaking apprentice; they had married in Grantham come 1897 after meeting as choristers in the town's Methodist chapel. Eggleston's father, one of nine children from a Nottinghamshire farm, relocated the family regularly through his successful work at an insurance firm. His mother, similarly privileged, is said to have received an education from a \\"Victorian private school for young ladies\\". The family purchased a grocer's shop in Netherfield, Nottinghamshire, briefly resettling there until 1909. During this short period, Wilfrid was educated at the newly established Chandos Street School, which amalgamated in 1973 to form Carlton le Willows School. Following this, Wilfrid moved to a ranch in the emerging settlement of Orion, Alberta with his family on the advice of a neighbor; the farming of wheat was a predominant activity. However, following a major crop failure in 1917, he became the town's bank clerk after employment in a convenience store, but later left for Kronau, Saskatchewan due to a combination of poor business and boredom; the family ranch was later abandoned in 1923. After skipping several years of high school education through a fast- track course at Regina College, Eggleston enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts program at Queen's University in 1926. Career The Rowell‚ÄìSirois Commission of 1937, Eggleston is pictured second from the left on the back row After graduating from Queen's in 1928, Wilfrid Eggleston began writing for the locally printed Lethbridge Herald. He wrote under Canadian Senator William Ashbury Buchanan, whom had acquired ownership of the newspaper in 1905. Eggleston held Buchanan and his politics in high regard during his short stay at the publication. After just one year writing in Lethbridge, he became Ottawa correspondent for the Toronto Star in 1929, and witnessed significant political events in this position, including the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932. He also began writing through the media agency Reuters in the late 1920s by means of a syndicated weekly newspaper column, with a selection of his political pieces featuring in Time Magazine and a plethora of other noted publications. By the time Eggleston had resigned from the Toronto Star in 1936, he had risen to become the newspaper's parliamentary correspondent; he'd finished reporting through Reuters within the same year. Whilst maintaining his journalistic status as a freelance reporter, he began governmental service in 1937. He was a member of the secretariat in the Rowell‚ÄìSirois Commission, which sought to ease the encumbrance of the Great Depression by analyzing perceived flaws in the Canadian constitution. The outcome of the commission, supported by Eggleston, allowed for greater involvement in regard to unemployment insurance and pensions from the federal government. During this time he liaised with notable figures including Newton Rowell, James McGregor Stewart and Henry Angus (all of whom were also members of the venture). After gaining the trust of the Canadian government, he became Chief Censor for war-time Canada from 1942 until 1944; Eggleston's predecessor, Major James Haig-Smith, was ordered to ban some 600 published works due to leftist sympathies. Among the high- profile censorship requests that Eggleston didn't oblige to include the Battle of the St. Lawrence, after he discovered that it was merely an attempt to, as he put it, \\"give the Minister of Naval Affairs a scoop when he announced it to the House\\", and the Conscription Crisis of 1944, to which he was personally objected, despite pressure from then Prime Minister, Mackenzie King. Upon being discharged from the post, General L√©o Richer Lafl√®che commented in the Ottawa Citizen that he was \\"largely responsible for the efficient functioning of censorship in Canada\\". He was succeeded in the role by fellow journalist Fulgence Charpentier. Later in life, Wilfrid was involved in more academic pursuits. He had received a basic teacher-training education from the Calgary Normal School (latterly a part of the University of Alberta), and taught for some years in the Golden Prairie School District before lecturing at Carleton University in 1947. In the same year, he became founder and director of the Carleton School of Journalism, a post he held until 1966. The Canadian Encyclopedia claims that Eggleston \\"was considered the father of journalism education in Canada, emphasizing its roots in the liberal arts and social sciences\\". Honours, recognition and death He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1943 by George VI in the Birthday Honours of that year, shortly after resigning his censor post. Approaching the conclusion of the Second World War, Eggleston made several public appearances in his native United Kingdom on behalf of the Ministry of Information, including at the White Rock Pavilion on 20 April 1945, where he expressed Canadian support for the British war effort, with particular admiration for the Battle of Britain. Becoming a prominent author on Canadian history and politics upon retirement from the civil service, Eggleston earned the recognition of the Writers' Guild of Alberta, which established the 'Wilfrid Eggleston Award for Nonfiction' in 1982. Dying in Ottawa on 13 June 1986 at 85 years of age, Eggleston's extensive book collection of some 3,000 works was donated to the University of Lethbridge in 2006, despite interest from Carleton and Queen's universities, his academic institution and alma mater respectively. Published works A ramshackle store in Orion, Alberta; Eggleston wrote at length about the hardships of ranching in the hamlet in two of his memoirs Eggleston published a total of 17 books throughout his life; these included seven on Canadian history, five on its politics and three personal memoirs. He further published poetry anthologies in 1927, and again in 1978 with his wife Magdalena Ra≈°keviƒçiutƒó, herself a noted Lithuanian-Canadian author, to commemorate their fiftieth wedding anniversary. Their daughter, classical pianist and composer Anne Eggleston (1934 ‚Äì 1994), became a distinguished contemporary of Robert Fleming, John Weinzweig, Oskar Morawetz and Godfrey Ridout, through her association with The Royal Conservatory of Music.

These were relatively primitive designs with open backs, armed with a Pom-pom gun and a machine gun, and were delivered to the British army in 1915. They were used also by the Tsarist Russian Army as self-propelled anti-aircraft guns. After the war, a new design was needed to replace armoured cars that had been worn out. As a result, the Peerless Armoured Car design was developed in 1919. It was based on the chassis of the Peerless three ton lorry, with an armoured body built by the Austin Motor Company. The Peerless lorry was a relatively slow and heavy vehicle but was reckoned to be tough, with solid rubber tyres and rear-wheel chain drive. The armour for the vehicle produced by the Austin company was based on an earlier design created for the Russian Army, which had been used in very limited numbers at the end of the war in France. The original Austin design, however, was shorter than the Peerless and the resulting combination was awkward and difficult to steer in confined spaces. In order to reduce the problem, a duplicate set of driving controls was installed at the rear of the vehicle. The most common variant was a twin-turret design fitted with two machine guns. However, a number of other variants were developed, including a vehicle armed with a 3-inch gun and an anti-aircraft variant armed with a 13-pounder AA gun. A Peerless armoured car in action in an urban setting in County Cork during the Irish Civil War, 1922 Poor off-road performance hampered the vehicle but it still saw considerable service, notably in Ireland. A few were still in service with the British at the start of the Second World War. Seven were in service with the Irish National Army during the Irish Civil War and used by the Irish Defence Forces up until 1932. The type was not popular in Irish service. One was taken to Cork City on board the SS Arvonian as part of the sea-borne landing force but took a long time to unload. The car was reliable, but slow, heavy, unstable, and unsuitable for poor roads - effectively meaning that its deployment by the Irish military was almost exclusively restricted to urban areas. (See Rolls Royce Armoured Car.) In 1935, four Irish Peerless armoured hulls were mounted on modified Leyland Terrier 6x4 chassis. A year later their twin turrets were replaced by a single Landsverk L60 tank turret. This new vehicle was known as the Leyland Armoured Car and remained in Irish service until the early 1980s. The 14 old Irish Peerless turrets with their Hotchkiss machine guns were fitted in 1940 to 14 Irish-built vehicles and designated the Ford Mk V Armoured Car.Karl Martin, Irish Army Vehicles, Transport & Armour Since 1922, Karl Martin 2002.

When finished, it will span up to five blocks to the west of Brickell Avenue and to the south of the Miami River, in the Brickell district of Greater Downtown. It will be anchored by a 107,000 square-foot Saks Fifth Avenue, Cinemex, and Italian food hall. The project is located between 7th and 8th Streets on both sides of South Miami Avenue and east of South Miami Ave on the north side of 7th Street. Additionally, it may expand to develop two more blocks that Swire already owns at 700 Brickell Avenue and SE 6 Street. The large project was first proposed during the real estate bubble of the 2000s, but then cancelled during the economic downturn. It was revived in 2012 with enough acreage to qualify for Special Area Plan (SAP) zoning with construction beginning by year's end. The hotel and residential towers, as well as some office space, opened in 2016. Phased retail openings started in November 2016. A second phase began construction in 2017. Contrary to the name, the development is not in the traditional downtown Miami city centre, but in the more recently redeveloped Brickell financial district. Overview The semi- enclosed retail concourse of the Brickell City Centre. The project is being developed by Swire Properties Inc (the US subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Swire Properties), and spans slightly over 9 acres. Amenities include a soon to open department store Saks Fifth Avenue, luxury shops, restaurants, hotel, office towers and condominiums. The hotel flag was awarded to EAST, a Swire Hotels brand, which will be their first venture in North America. Currently there are EAST hotels in Hong Kong and Beijing, China. In February 2013, Swire Properties and the owners of Bal Harbour Shops announced that they had come to an agreement to co-develop the retail portion of the development. Later, in 2015, mall developer Simon Property Group also became a retail partner. Limited portions of the project opened at the end of 2015, while the residential towers began occupancy in mid-2016. The retail section opened at the beginning of November 2016 with a formal ribbon cutting and concert by Miami based rapper Pitbull. The Eighth Street Metromover station reopened in late 2015, though the third floor connection to the retail component remained locked until December 2016. The project has been a catalyst for development in the trendy Brickell neighborhood. In the direct vicinity of the project, many luxury hi-rise buildings are under construction as of 2017. Arquitectonica, the architecture firm that designed the project was also chosen to create the Brickell Heights towers which are located between Brickell City Centre and the shops at Mary Brickell Village. In 2017, the company reported 70 percent of condo sales were to Latin American buyers. By 2018, ‚Äú80 percent of sales are going to local and domestic buyers.‚Äù History 169x169px 150x150pxThe development was originally proposed as a complex of four skyscrapers was approved by both the City of Miami and the Federal Aviation Administration, but the entire complex was cancelled in 2008 due to poor market conditions.159x159px In June 2011 the project was revived by Swire Properties, and the complex is now planned to consist of four stories of retail and entertainment space, topped by six smaller towers; two residential, two office, a wellness tower and a hotel. Arquitectonica remains as the architect and ArquitectonicaGEO as the landscape architect. Two additional lots were purchased by Swire in 2011, the Brickell Tennis Club and the Eastern National Bank building making the entire development site over . This permitted the project to receive Special Area Plan (SAP) zoning which according to Miami law allows developers to work more closely with the city on \\"integration of public improvements and infrastructure\\" Under the Special Area Plan, Swire was able to renovate and integrate the Eighth Street Metromover Station into the development. The project also contains two levels of underground parking, covered sidewalks, and interconnectivity between all the buildings. Underground parking in South Florida is a rarity due to the low elevation above sea level. The 2,600 sub-grade car park for Brickell City Centre covers , and required installation of watertight slurry walls from the site elevation of NGVD to around -. The City Commission gave the project its final approval in July 2011.206x206pxOn July 15, 2013, it was announced that Swire Properties had purchased an adjacent site at 700 Brickell Avenue in Miami, formerly the regional headquarters of Northern Trust Bank. The lot totals 1.55 acres and was purchased for just over $64 million. In September 2013, Swire announced the plans for the site, which include the previously purchased Eastern National Bank building. The proposal is for a future phase of the project which includes an 80-story tower, called One Brickell City Centre, which will include retail, Class-A offices, condominiums and hotel space. The building was originally proposed at , but was later reduced to , at which height it was approved by the FAA. The project is LEED for Neighborhood Development certified. Among other things, sidewalks are set back from city streets and shielded from traffic by lush plantings. Numerous green features are also incorporated into buildings such as the climate ribbon. Towers The phase one towers are tall and slender with glass walls and standard balconies. Towering over the five-story mall that covers the majority of three city blocks are three high rises, known as \\"EAST\\", \\"Reach\\", and \\"Rise\\". Each is just over with about 45 floors. There is also a proposed tower known as One Brickell City Centre. Its height has been approved by the FAA and it would be the tallest building in Miami. The residential towers were \\"topped-out\\" in 2015 and began occupancy in 2016. While no official start date was given for One Brickell City Centre, Swire reported that it would be after the completion of phase one. There is also a plan for a more modest second phase tower known as \\"North Squared\\" that would be at SE 6 Street. Similarly to the first three towers, it would be a little over with just under 50 floors, as well as over 700 additional parking spaces than the several as part of the current underground garage. One Brickell City Centre would be the tallest building in Miami by a large margin, beating the under construction Panorama Tower by over , though other supertall (1,000 ft+) buildings have been proposed in Miami.

Shard of Spring tells the story of a group of adventurers hired to retrieve the titular magical item stolen by a power- hungry evil witch. The game was generally well received upon its release and was followed by a sequel titled Demon's Winter in 1988. Gameplay The player's party in Shard of Spring can be made up of at least two human, dwarf, elf, troll or gnome adventurers, each of whom can be either a warrior or a wizard (both classes have very different set of traits to assign points to). The game's game world system is displayed in the top-down view, and the combat system for the fights (mostly random encounters) is similar to turn-based tactical war games. Its spell system is based on five elements: fire, metal, wind, ice and spirit. Plot For two centuries a small island of Ymros enjoyed eternal springtime thanks to the enchanted Shard of Spring, a piece of the long-lost legendary Life Stone. However, three years ago the land's peace was shattered when a mysterious Siriadne arrived to Ymros and stole the Shard. With the threat of the Shard's destruction, the selfish sorceress and her minions now extort a ruinous and ever-increasing tribute from the people of Ymros. Anyone who might put an end to her tyranny will be a hero for all time to come. The aim of the game is to gain access to Siriadne's castle (which is encircled by a magical force field) and defeat her. The player needs to kill Siriadne's chief followers Devon the Destroyer, Ralith (in Ralith's Tower) and Edrin (in Edrin's Dungeon) so the party can storm Siriadne's Fortress. Siriadne herself transforms into a dragon for the final battle. After the player's victory, the game ends in a cryptic way.\\"(...) As you turn to go back into the room, you see a black bird out of the corner of your eye, moving swiftly upward. As you re-enter the room, an old man who you recognize is standing near the dead body of Siriadne. His face shows a mixture of serenity and contentment. He speaks: 'The true springtime shall now return to Ymros because of what you have done today. Your names shall be remembered as long as men exist to sing of you.' He makes some mysterious motions and everything begins to swirl about you. His voice speaks to you out of the dizziness: 'Evil is personified in the form of dragons, but borne in the hearts of men...'\\" Reception SSI sold 11,942 copies of Shard of Spring in North America. The game was generally well received upon its release. According to QuestBusters, \\"anyone completely burned out on the 'seek and slay' scenario should look elsewhere,\\" but \\"Phantasie fans who found Wizard's Crown too complex will appreciate this one, which combines the best elements of each - easily making it SSI's best game since the original Phantasie.\\" Scorpia of Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review in 1986, noting it as a good hack and slash type. The graphics were considered well-done, even in monochrome, but the reviewer felt leveling in the later part of the game went far too slowly. In 1993 she called Shard of Spring \\"a typical hack-and-slash romp\\" but \\"not bad for its type, and better than some\\". On the other hand, Philippa Irving in Zzap!64 criticized the game's \\"lacklustre\\" presentation (55%) and \\"dull\\" graphics 65%, but nevertheless gave Shard of Spring a high overall rating of 88%, calling it \\"just short of brilliant\\" due to its \\"absorbing, tantalizing, and satisfying\\" playability. Rick Teverbaugh of RUN also gave it a positive review, even as he opined it was not \\"exactly a frontrunner in the Game of the Year voting.\\" The game, however, did not became a classic title. Tim Bailey reviewed Shard of Spring in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer commented that \\"if you have the money to spare, and Ultima IV is not available, and you can't wait, Shard of Spring is a good, but inferior imitation.\\" In 1987, Mark Patters of Commodore User gave Shard of Spring a rating of 6/10. Reviewers often compared this game to Ultima III: Exodus. According to a critical retrospective review by John Gorenfeld in Allgame, \\"unlike Wizard's Crown, SSI's RPG Shard of Spring has none of the company's characteristic war game detail. In fact, it feels like a low-rent version of Ultima III, with the latter's simple tactical combat, but less atmosphere.\\" It was reported that the game had a balance problem in which the players would receive too few experience points for their victories; this problem was fixed in the sequel. Legacy A follow-up to Shard of Spring was created by the same team and published by SSI in 1988. The sequel has Ymros once again threatened by evil as the players must search for spells to defeat the demon-god Malifon who has cast the world into a deep freeze. It expanded on the first game in some ways such as offering more character classes.

Here, FC_k is known as the friction cone, and for the Coulomb model of friction, is actually a cone with apex at the origin, extending to infinity in the normal direction of the contact. Let f_1,\\\\ldots,f_N be the (unspecified) forces at the contact points. To balance the object in static equilibrium, the following Newton-Euler equations must be met on f_1,\\\\ldots,f_N: * \\\\sum_{k=1}^N f_k + G = 0 * \\\\sum_{k=1}^N f_k \\\\times C_k + G \\\\times CM = 0 * f_k \\\\in FC_k for all k where G is the force of gravity on the object, and CM is its center of mass. The first two equations are the Newton-Euler equations, and the third requires all forces to be valid. If there is no set of forces f_1,\\\\ldots,f_N that meet all these conditions, the object will not be in equilibrium. The second equation has no dependence on the vertical component of the center of mass, and thus if a solution exists for one CM, the same solution works for all CM+\\\\alpha G. Therefore, the set of all CM that have solutions to the above conditions is a set that extends infinitely in the up and down directions. The support polygon is simply the projection of this set on the horizontal plane. These results can easily be extended to different friction models and an infinite number of contact points (i.e. a region of contact). Properties Even though the word \\"polygon\\" is used to describe this region, in general it can be any convex shape with curved edges. The support polygon is invariant under translations and rotations about the gravity vector (that is, if the contact points and friction cones were translated and rotated about the gravity vector, the support polygon is simply translated and rotated). If the friction cones are convex cones (as they typically are), the support polygon is always a convex region. It is also invariant to the mass of the object (provided it is nonzero). If all contacts lie on a (not necessarily horizontal) plane, and the friction cones at all contacts contain the negative gravity vector -G, then the support polygon is the convex hull of the contact points projected onto the horizontal plane.

She was portrayed by Terri Conn from August 29, 1998 to September 17, 2010. She was also portrayed by Cori Anne Hansen as a child, from 1989 to 1994. Conn, known as Terri Colombino during the majority of her years on the show, is considered to be one of the most popular young heroines to appear on ATWT in its final decade. Casting and characterization Terri Conn joined the cast of the CBS daytime drama ATWT in 1998 but was not the first to appear on the show in the role as Cori Anne Hansen played the part from 1989 to 1994. Conn previously appeared as a model on another CBS soap opera, The Young and the Restless in 1995. The actress' popularity as the young heroine is considered to be one of the last in the final decade of the show. The actress and character's critical acclaim allowed the show to capitalize on the attention with the release of the novel Oakdale Confidential: A Novel, which spanned a series of other books inspired by other CBS and ABC daytime dramas. At the conclusion of the show in 2010, Conn commented on her favorite storyline which saw her character manage life without her husband, who recently died. > \\"I definitely felt like the day when Brad died was one [her favorite story] > because it was so beautifully written. And that is another thing, too. You > have to have the writing and there has to be a great story.

Katie said of her relationship with him that \\"When it came to Simon, I now had calluses upon calluses on my heart to protect me from his powers of persuasion.\\"Oakdale Confidential: A Novel. Adams, Alina. Pocket Books (2006) Katie (Terri Conn) and Simon (Paul Leyden) were a successful couple on ATWT. Their marriage and subsequent on- again, off-again relationship came about in between Katie's breakups and divorces with Henry Coleman and Mike Kasnoff and the death of her other great love Brad Snyder, who she shares a son with, Jacob Snyder. Although Henry and Katie's friendship remained strong, Henry's portrayer Trent Dawson said that \\"Katie loved Henry, but she wasn't in love with him.\\" Katie was also married to Brad's brother Jack Snyder in 2007. The marriage was rushed due to Katie's insecurities and her dislike for his ex-wife Carly Snyder, as well as Jack's own issues. Katie eventually became engaged to former love Chris Hughes by the end of the series.http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2010/09/as_the_world_turns_final_episode.php Among Katie's other relationships were her best friends Henry and his ex- fiancee Vienna Hyatt, both of whom became surrogate family to her.

In mathematics, ' is the infinite series whose terms are the successive powers of two. As a geometric series, it is characterized by its first term, 1, and its common ratio, 2. As a series of real numbers it diverges to infinity, so in the usual sense it has no sum. In a much broader sense, the series is associated with another value besides ‚àû, namely ‚àí1, which is the limit of the series using the 2-adic metric. Summation The partial sums of are since these diverge to infinity, so does the series. :2^0+2^1+\\\\cdots+2^k = 2^{k+1}-1 Therefore, any totally regular summation method gives a sum of infinity, including the Ces√†ro sum and Abel sum.Hardy p. 10 On the other hand, there is at least one generally useful method that sums to the finite value of ‚àí1. The associated power series :f(x) = 1+2x+4x^2+8x^3+\\\\cdots+2^n{}x^n+\\\\cdots = \\\\frac{1}{1-2x} has a radius of convergence around 0 of only , so it does not converge at . Nonetheless, the so-defined function f has a unique analytic continuation to the complex plane with the point deleted, and it is given by the same rule . Since , the original series is said to be summable (E) to ‚àí1, and ‚àí1 is the (E) sum of the series. (The notation is due to G. H. Hardy in reference to Leonhard Euler's approach to divergent series).Hardy pp.8, 10 An almost identical approach (the one taken by Euler himself) is to consider the power series whose coefficients are all 1, i.e. :1+y+y^2+y^3+\\\\cdots = \\\\frac{1}{1-y} and plugging in y = 2\\\\. These two series are related by the substitution y = 2x. The fact that (E) summation assigns a finite value to shows that the general method is not totally regular. On the other hand, it possesses some other desirable qualities for a summation method, including stability and linearity. These latter two axioms actually force the sum to be ‚àí1, since they make the following manipulation valid: :\\\\begin{array}{rcl} s & = &\\\\displaystyle 1+2+4+8+16+\\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = &\\\\displaystyle 1+2(1+2+4+8+\\\\cdots) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = &\\\\displaystyle 1+2s \\\\end{array} In a useful sense, s = ‚àû is a root of the equation (For example, ‚àû is one of the two fixed points of the M√∂bius transformation on the Riemann sphere). If some summation method is known to return an ordinary number for s, i.e. not ‚àû, then it is easily determined. In this case s may be subtracted from both sides of the equation, yielding , so .The two roots of are briefly touched on by Hardy p. 19. The above manipulation might be called on to produce ‚àí1 outside the context of a sufficiently powerful summation procedure. For the most well-known and straightforward sum concepts, including the fundamental convergent one, it is absurd that a series of positive terms could have a negative value. A similar phenomenon occurs with the divergent geometric series 1 ‚àí 1 + 1 ‚àí 1 + ‚ãØ, where a series of integers appears to have the non-integer sum . These examples illustrate the potential danger in applying similar arguments to the series implied by such recurring decimals as 0.111‚Ä¶ and most notably 0.999‚Ä¶. The arguments are ultimately justified for these convergent series, implying that and , but the underlying proofs demand careful thinking about the interpretation of endless sums.Gardiner pp. 93‚Äì99; the argument on p. 95 for is slightly different but has the same spirit. It is also possible to view this series as convergent in a number system different from the real numbers, namely, the 2-adic numbers. As a series of 2-adic numbers this series converges to the same sum, ‚àí1, as was derived above by analytic continuation.

Ipswich Road used to be part of the Cunningham Highway. Logan Road, Pacific Motorway, and Beaudesert Road (Mount Lindesay Highway) are the other major roads in the south of Brisbane. The road was an important transport route in 19th century Brisbane. Woolloongabba Ipswich Road begins at the Woolloongabba Five Ways intersection. From there Ipswich Road heads south bound for Ipswich City, Main Street heads north (to the tip of Kangaroo Point), Stanley Street goes east and west and Logan Road heads south-east towards Logan City. The heritage-listed Norman Hotel is positioned on 102 Ipswich Road at Woolloongabba. The establishment was built in 1889, opened in 1890 and quickly became a local landmark. The Clem Jones Tunnel (Clem7) has an entry and exit point on Ipswich Road at Woolloongabba, the same place that the Pacific Motorway crosses over the road. Also in this vicinity the Eastern Busway crosses Ipswich Road. Buranda The Princess Alexandra Hospital is located on Ipswich Road at Buranda, as is the Buranda Shopping Centre (formerly the Ipswich Road tram depot). Annerley Ipswich Road near the junction of Annerley Road in Annerley, Queensland, 2009 At Annerley, Ipswich Road intersects with Annerley Road (formerly Boggo Road) at the Annerley Junction. There are a number of heritage-listed sites on Ipswich Road in Annerley. In the Annerley Junction area are: * 413 Ipswich Road: Tram substation (part of the infrastructure of Brisbane's former tramways, now used as a hotel restaurant) * 413 Ipswich Road: Fig tree (the sole survivor of an avenue of fig trees planted on Ipswich Road in Annerley between 1911 and 1955) * 444 Ipswich Road: Police Station (built in 1925 and still in use as a police station) * 448 Ipswich Road: Annerley Library & Community Centre (designed in 1956 by architect James Birrell) Further along in the Chardon's Corner area (the intersection with Cracknell Road where the Chardons Hotel stands), there are more heritage-listed sites: * 616 Ipswich Road: Mary Immaculate Catholic Church (a notable city landmark due to its prominent position its imposing interwar Gothic architecture) * 770 Ipswich Road: Shops Yeronga In Yeronga the road passes the heritage-listed Yeronga Memorial Park and the heritage-listed Yeronga Fire Station. The Ipswich Road is the boundary between Annerley and Yeronga in the vicinity of the Yeronga Memorial Park (Annerley being on the east, Yeronga on the west). Moorooka At Moorooka the major arterial road called Beaudesert Road branches to the south east through the industrial suburbs of Salisbury, Acacia Ridge continuing on to the northern outskirts of Logan City. It is when Beaudesert Road crosses the Logan Motorway that Beaudesert Road becomes the Mount Lindesay Highway, which continues through to Logan, Jimboomba, Beaudesert and Mount Lindesay and beyond to the Queensland-New South Wales border. South from this intersection the road is lined with numerous car sale yards and is known as the Moorooka Magic Mile of Motors. Rocklea At Rocklea the road becomes the upgraded Ipswich Motorway after crossing over the Beenleigh railway line. Road traffic At morning peak times the road can be congested anywhere from Annerley towards the city. According to the Brisbane City Council compared to 2007 rates, by 2016 the road is expected to carry an extra 12,000 cars each day. The road carried an average of 52,299 vehicles per day between July and December 2014.
