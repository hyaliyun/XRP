Pac√≠fico Licutan was a Muslim slave and Islamic community and religious leader in colonial Brazil in the 1800s, and was involved in the 1835 Mal√™ Revolt in a leadership capacity. He was not killed in the revolt but did die shortly afterwards, after February 11, 1835. He was also known as \\"Bilal\\", a connection to the Islamic figure Bilal ibn Rabah and a regional word for prayer caller, following and in his trial related to the 1835 Mal√™ revolt. His birth-date is unknown.  Life  Litucan was a Yoruba‚Äîalso referred to as the ethnic group Nag√¥, as opposed to the Hausa ethnicity‚Äî, the largest group of Muslims in Salvador or Bahia at the time. Litucan was a tobacco roller living in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. He was owned by a doctor, Antonio Pinto de mesquite Varalle. Litucan was active in the Islamic community and was considered a mestre, or teacher in Portuguese, or alufa to the Yoruba, in his community. Attempts to buy Litucan and free him by his Islamic fellows and followers were ineffective, as they were refused twice. When his owner died he was seized and imprisoned in November of 1834, to be sold away in order to service debts of his deceased master. As a Nag√¥, he came from an area now known as Southern Nigeria. Despite only making up 4.5% of Brazilian slaves, Nag√¥ people were influential in the Afro-Brazilian community in general and in Bahia particularly, and were also often Muslim, contributing to the closely knit community in Salvador.  Bahian Mal√™ Revolt  Over the month of Ramadan he was held and the Muslim community plotted the eventual revolt, but had accidentally leaked the plan. Leading up to the night of Layla al-Quadr, or the night of Power and destiny, the government prepared for the revolt. Before the night of January 25th, 1835, troops moved on the soon to be rebels and attacked at breakfast, and the Bahian Slave revolt began. The slaves were, with relative ease, crushed, attacking the prison and barracks but breaking before sustained fire and cavalry charges. The majority of the group were male African Slaves, and many were Yoruba(Nag√¥) from the Bight of Benin despite its low share to the total slave imports. 61% of tried slaves after the revolt were Nag√¥, and Nag√¥ leaders show up most in period documentation of the revolt and the individuals held responsible for the distuption and loss of life. After the revolt ended, the Brazilian authorities failed, despite torturing him, to acquire names of other Muslims or students of the old Alufa. In records pertaining to the uprising written shortly after it happened, Licutan is recorded as either the most or the second most beloved figure in the Muslim community at the time, and a recognized authority in a religious tradition for which all scriptural forms had to have been brought over by memory. State of Bahia in Brazil, Capital, Salvador = Impact on Latin American Islam = This event is one of the few Muslim related topics with even moderate engagement in the historical community, and as a result proper comparison to particularly other Muslim revolts but even other religious groups is limited compared to other regions. Historiographically the jury is not out on exactly what role Islam did play in the inciting of the large revolt, and what conclusions to draw from data regarding previous smaller revolts.

Academics ;Academics Virtually all maintained schools and academies follow the National Curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted on how well they succeed in delivering a 'broad and balanced curriculum'. Schools endeavour to get all students to achieve the English Baccalaureate (EBACC) qualification- this must include core subjects a modern foreign language, and either History or Geography. Students explore as many subjects as possible at Key Stage 3 before specialising at Key Stages 4 and 5. To achieve this, students study French or Spanish and humanities subjects such as Art, Drama, Photography or Criminology in Key Stage 3. Students are guided in their year 9 option choice of GCSEs and A-level allowing for Russell Group university ambitions, another universities or for entering into employment or training.

Name The ethnonym Ngaatjatjarra, in line with a general practice in their area, combines the interrogative pronoun used by each tribe for \\"who\\", \\"what\\". In their case this yields up a combination of ≈ãa:da and the possessive suffix -t(d)jara, is attached. The sense therefore is, \\"(people) using the form ≈ãa:da for the idea of 'who/what'\\". Language Ngaatjatjarra is mutually intelligible with Ngaanyatjarra, and both are treated as dialects of the one language. Country Norman Tindale assigned them traditional lands he estimated as covering roughly . The centre of their traditional life was in the Warburton Ranges and in particular at a site, Warupuju Spring, where water was always available. Their eastern frontiers lay around Fort Welcome, the Blackstone Ranges, Murray Range and Mount Hinckley. In the southeast, their furthest boundary was at the Ero:tjo watering hole, south of Wangalina. To the northeast, they roamed as far as Kudjuntari in the Schwerin Mural Crescent Range and around Julia (Giles) in the Rawlinson Ranges. Their northern range extended to Hopkins Lake and Carnegie Range and beyond the Christopher Lake. Their western limits were around Tekateka and Jalara and the Alfred Marie Ranges. Tindale's map places the neighbouring tribes of the Ngaatjatjarra as, running clockwise, the Keiadjara and the Wenamba to their north, the Pitjantjatjara on their eastern frontier, the Nakako and Mandjindja to their south and the Ngaanyatjarra on their western borders. The AIATSIS map calls then Ngatatjara and absorbs the Keiadjara and the Wenamba in to the Martu and Pintupi respectively. A native map of their water mythology explaining how the overarching rainbow, Tjurtira≈ão, produces the various water resources, was made for Tindale in the 1939s and is reproduced in his 1974 book.  Ngaanyatjara lands  The \\"Ngaanyatjara lands\\" are those administered by the Ngaanyatjarra Council (Aboriginal Corporation), which includes the communities ofhttps://www.ngaanyatjarra.org.au/map Map of communities with links to extra details Irrunytju (Wingelinna), Kiwirrkurra, Mantamaru (Jameson), Papulankutja (Blackstone), Patjarr (Karilywara), Kanpa (Pira Kata), Tjirrkarli, Tjukurla, Warakurna, Wanarn, Warburton (Mirlirrtjarra). Social organization The practiced patrilocal residence, and their marriage arrangements were based on for class system. Father's father, father, son, son's son and their brothers inherited a totem (tjukur/tuma) which bore associations with specific topographical features of the landscape that evoked the movements of the creative being in their dreaming. They practiced both circumcision and subincision, in two distinct phrases, on youths undergoing initiation into full manhood, employing biface pressure-flaked stone knives ('tjimbila), which they obtained through trade with neighbouring tribes to their north, who in turn ultimately received them from their production centre in northwestern Australia. Food The Ngaatjatjarra harvested grass seeds (wakati) and worked them with rolling stones to obtain a paste for nutriment. They also gathered nicotiniana excelsior, a tobacco leaf which they dried over fire and which they chew after mixing them with ashes from burnt acacia and phyllodes. History of contact The first white contact with the Ngaatjatjarra came relatively late. Tindale describes in detail one nuclear family of the tribe encountered in August 1935 during the Expedition of the Board for Anthropological Research of the University of Adelaide.

She received her B.A. with honors at the University of Tasmania (1981). She went on to receive her M.A. (1983) and her Ph.D. (1985) from the University of British Columbia in Clinical Psychology, where she worked alongside Jack Rachman. Craske completed a postdoctoral fellowship in SUNY Albany under the guidance of David Barlow. In 1990, Craske joined the faculty of UCLA where she has remained throughout her career. Her research on treatments for anxiety disorders and depression has been supported through grants from the National Institute of Mental Health.  Research  Craske's research views fear and anxiety as separable constructs and explores how anxiety can stem from fear and be treated through fear extinction. One of her main goals has been to find effective treatments for anxiety, including methods of reducing panic attacks. Craske has develop a series of a computer- assisted therapy programs for treating anxiety disorders that are designed to help therapists and their clients. Craske's and her colleagues have focused on emotion regulation in clients, using focused breathing to promote mindfulness. They found that participants who practiced focused breathing responded less negatively to aversive stimuli whereas participants who practiced unfocused breathing reported more distress. This result suggests that focused breathing may be used in therapeutic contexts to help clients respond less strongly to negative stimuli. One of her most cited studies involved a two-year follow-up of patients who received behavioral treatment for panic disorder. Treatment included progressive muscle relaxation, interoceptive exposure therapy with cognitive restructuring, or a combination of both. The results showed that 81% of the patients remained panic free after the 2 year assessment.  Representative Publications  * Arch, J. J., & Craske, M. G. (2006).

It was first described by Philog√®ne Auguste Joseph Duponchel in 1836. Description A single egg is laid on the buds of the food plant in May and June. The newly hatched larva enters the twig near the apex of the bud. At first the frass is ejected but as the larva penetrates the twig the frass packs the tunnel. The gall is a spindle-shaped swelling, which can be difficult to find, on a one- or two-year-old willow shoot. Inside, the 3 cm tunnel-like chamber contains a larva or pupa. The larva overwinters fully fed in a cocoon, preparing an exit hole before it pupates in April or May. The exit hole is just above a bud and is covered by silk mixed with reddish frass. When the moth emerges the pupal exuviae is left in the exit hole making the gall easier to find. The gall has been recorded on eared willow (Salix aurita), goat willow (S. caprea), grey willow (S. cinerea) and creeping willow S. repens.

At its peak in 1868, the Aurora Colony had about 600 people and of land. The colony, along with Keil's previously established Bethel colony, was formally dissolved in 1883. In 1974, about and 12 buildings of the former colony were inscribed on the National Register of Historic Places as parts of the Aurora Colony Historic District..\\"Department of the Interior, Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service: National Register of Historic Places; Annual Listing of Historic Properties\\", 44 FR 7416 (February 6, 1979), at p. 7570. Background William Keil was a Prussian-born tailor who moved to the United States with his wife in the 1830s. He opened open a tailor shop in New York City, and studied pharmacology. He then moved to Pennsylvania and set up a drugstore and sold medicines. Around this time, he began calling himself \\"Dr. Keil.\\" In 1839, Keil became a preacher after attending a Methodist revival meeting. In Pennsylvania, he began to amass followers, including members of George Rapp's Economy Colony. In 1844 he and his followers established the Bethel community in Missouri, which at its peak had 650 members. Founding Though Keil's community in Missouri was successful and nearly self-sufficient, he decided to expand his colony to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. In 1853, he sent a scout party to find a location for \\"A Second Eden.\\" In May 1855, Keil and several members of his Bethel colony in Missouri began the wagon journey to Washington Territory. Four days before they set out, Keil's son Willy died of malaria. Not wanting to leave his son behind, Keil put the body in a wooden, lead-lined coffin and covered it with Whiskey from the Bethel Distillery to preserve it. The group first settled in Willapa Bay, Washington. After spending the Winter there, Keil decided the land was not suitable for a self-sufficient agricultural community and began searching for a new location. In 1856 he purchased land and a functioning mill south of Oregon City. He named the Colony Aurora Mills after his daughter, Aurora. The original colony contained 250 members who had left the Bethel Colony with Keil. Colonial life The Aurora Colony built homes, schools, business, mills, and a hotel. The colony also created a fruit orchard and produced hand- made goods. The Oregon & California Railway line expanded to pass through Aurora in 1870, which brought additional business to the colony. The train stopped four times a day for meals in its hotel. The Aurora Colony Band became well known on the West Coast, and traveled throughout the region to perform music. The charismatic Keil was the sole leader of the group. As the spiritual leader, he installed his own form of Christianity in the community. Keil preached a simple ideal about brotherhood and love and taught a \\"No title but Christian\\" and \\"No rules but the Bible\\" form of Christianity, maintaining that all existing religions were human creations. As in many other utopian communities, its founder held special privileges. He instated confession in order to maintain the member's humility, yet was immune from taking part in confession himself. He was also exempt from taking part in manual labor. Keil lived in a large house in the colony, called \\"Gross Haus\\" (German for Big House). As part of keeping order and maintaining his place in the community, Keil utilized mortification functions, calling out deviants for their transgressions during public meetings. =Smallpox outbreak= In 1862, a member of the colony took care of an individual outside the colony who had smallpox and brought it back to the Aurora Colony. As a result, many in Aurora contracted the disease and many died. Four of Keil's children died in the outbreak, including his daughter Aurora, the colony's namesake. Dissolution of the colony Keil had held all the communal property in his name. In 1872, after the death of his only remaining daughter, Keil began to transfer ownership of colony land to individual families in the community and intended to transfer more later. However, by the time he died suddenly on December 30, 1877, he had not made any additional transfers. It was decided to dissolve the two colonies, and the dissolution was formally declared on January 22, 1883. The land was later incorporated and became the modern-day city of Aurora, Oregon. Legacy In 1966 the Old Aurora Colony Museum was established, dedicated to maintaining the history of the colony. In 1974, twenty sites in Aurora were added to the National Register of Historical Places. =In media= Author Jane Kirkpatrick wrote a trilogy of novels about the experience of Emma Wagner Giesy, the only female member of Keil's scout party to find a location for a new colony in the Pacific Northwest that eventually became the Aurora Colony. The three novels in Kirkpatrick's series are \\"A Clearing in the Wild\\" (2006), \\"A Tendering In the Storm\\" (2007), and \\"Mending at the Edge\\" (2008).

Cramer was the 2014 recipient of the Bruno Klopfer Award from the Society for Personality Assessment for lifetime achievement in Personality Psychology. Cramer is the author of several books including Protecting the Self: Defense Mechanisms in Action (2006), Story Telling, Narrative and the Thematic Apperception Test (1996), The Development of Defense Mechanisms: Theory, Research, and Assessment (1991), and Word Association (1968).  Biography  Cramer received her B.A from the University of California, Berkeley in 1957. She attended graduate school at New York University where she obtained her Ph.D in Psychology in 1962. Cramer was employed as a clinical psychologist at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn from 1962-1963. She was an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Barnard College from 1963-1965, and a visiting Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley from 1965-1970. In 1970 she joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at Williams College where she remained for her career. She is the mother of two daughters, Mara and Julia.  Research  Cramer is known for her work on personality and longitudinal studies of the development of personal identity from adolescence to adulthood. Some of her most influential work on defense mechanisms utilized the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). In one study, three defense mechanisms (denial, projection and identification) were examined in four different age groups (preschool, elementary school, early adolescents, and late adolescents) using the TAT. Preschool children were more likely to engage in denial than the other age groups and only minimally used the identification defense mechanism. Elementary school children and early adolescents often used the projection mechanism. In other work, Cramer studied the elements of narcissism in relation to the three ego defense mechanisms in late adolescents entering college. She identified links between usage of the three defense mechanisms and adolescent experiences of identity crisis, but failed to find links between the use of defense mechanisms and narcissism.

It was founded by French winemaker Yves Pouzet and his wife Valentina Grez in 1996. After scouting Chile for more than 10 years to locate areas where they could build their house and plant some vines, Pouzet identified this farm at the foothills of the Andes Mountains as the perfect place. In a small property of 6 hectares, they planted Carm√©n√®re, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Lacryma Christi and Viognier. Today, with a very limited production of 7,000 bottles, they produce only three wines: Tipaume, Grez and Sous La Terre.  History  Carm√©n√®re Vineyards at Vi√±a Tipaume. Yves Pouzet was born in Burgundy, France. He studied Agronomie in the Institut Agronomique de Paris and then specialised in oenologie in the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure agronomique de Montpellier. During his career, he travelled the world and worked in very different places, such as in Peru, Napa (Clos du Val), Brasil (Moet & Chandon), India (Champagne India) and Chile (Vi√±a Los Vascos, Chateau Los Boldos and Torre√≥n de Paredes). It was during his time in Chateau Los Boldos that Yves fell in love with Cachapoal and, in 1996, decided to purchase a piece of land in Lo de Lobos, between Rosario and Rengo. He planted 6 hectares of vines, and started his lifetime project. Since the beginning, he decided to avoid any kind of chemical in the vineyards, and also to practice dry farming. Under his belief and experience, he believed that with these practices he could achieve better quality grapes and for instance better wines. For this reason, he decided to apply for the Organic and Biodynamic certifications. For several years he sold the grapes to other wineries, until 2005, when he decided to build the winery and make his first wine.

He is one of the founders of the New Party (NOVO), which he presided from September 2015 to July 2017, and was its candidate in the Brazilian presidential election of 2018. Personal life Jo√£o Amo√™do is son of radiologist doctor Armando Rocha Amo√™do and business owner Maria Elisa Filgueira Barreto. In 1987, Amo√™do married Rosa Helena Nasser and together they have three daughters. Always dedicated to sports, he completed 6 Ironman and more than 10 marathons. In 2010, after recovering from a lymphoma, Amo√™do went back to his usual routine, including the sports. He remains active to this day. Founding the New Party In 2009, during a talk with friends, Amo√™do showed himself frustrated with the amount of taxes paid and the disproportionate level of public services provided in return by the government. He started to question the possibility of involving examples of private initiative to improve public services with great management, meritocracy, and transparency. After talks with politicians, he concluded that the only way to improve the lives of people is to bring new leadership to public life, creating a new institution - a political party different from the existing ones. The goal was to build a tool that would enable people that were never involved in politics but had an interest in it, and truly wanted to make a change, to participate. The only certainty, according to Amo√™do, was that the current politicians were not doing a good job, and the people had to get involved in order for true change to come about. Along with 181 citizens, those of 35 different professions and native from 10 different states from the Federation, found NOVO in 12 February 2011. In 15 September 2015, Novo had its definitive register approved and Amo√™do became the president of the party, withdrawn from office since July 2017. Political views He is in favor of defense of individual liberties for understanding that the free market is the business environment that works better for everyone, that the individual is the main wealth generator and that he is an agent of changes. Founder of New Party, Amo√™do states that everyone elected by the party will follow the liberal ideal, with State reduction, greater autonomy of the individual and the reduction of taxes. About Bolsa Fam√≠lia, Amo√™do says in a column in Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.

By the 10th-century, Java had one of the most complex economies in Southeast Asia. Despite the importance of rice farming which acts as the chief tax income for the Javanese courts, the influx of sea trade in Asia between the 10th and 13th centuries forced a more convenient currency to the Javanese economy. During the late 8th-century, ingots made of gold and silver were introduced. These are the early Nusantara coins. Early development in Central Java In Java, rice farming was still the main occupation of most households in the village. This continued to provide most of the tax income of the Javanese courts. Later in the period, the northern coasts of Java and Bali became the main center of an affluent export trade in local agricultural products and manufacture, as well as spices e.g. sandalwood from eastern Indonesia. These trade brought goods to distant markets e.g. China and India. The increasing intensity of trade called for a convenient currency in the Javanese society. During the late 8th-century money took the form of ingots made of gold and silver. These are the earliest recorded coins in Indonesia. The currency in Indonesia is based on weight; the most common units were the kati of , tahil of , masa and kupang . These units were legal tender for tax payments. The kati, tahil, masa and kupang units remained in use up until the Dutch period. Several trade jargons were introduced in this period, e.g. the Javanese wli, which became the modern Indonesian beli (\\"buy\\"), and the Sanskrit wyaya, modern Indonesian term biaya (\\"expenses\\") appears in two inscriptions both dated 878 AD. The Javanese coins have no parallels with the style of Indian coins. Most of the Javanese coins were found within the Javanese kingdom of Shailendra. =Gold coins= A gold coin of probably the highest denomination of ka. Most gold coins of 9th and early 10th century Java are stamped with the character ta in nagari script on one side, an abbreviation of tahil. The same character remained on coins until the Kediri period in the 12th-century. Gold coins were usually made in the shape of cubes, carefully crafted and very uniform in size and gold content. =Silver coins= Sandalwood decoration or quatrefoil appeared in the silver ingot on the picture below. Central Javanese silver coins have very different shapes compared with the gold coins. Most silver coins are round and known as \\"sandalwood flower\\" coins referring to the four-petaled flower (quatrefoil) found on the reverse. The silver coins lasted from the early 9th until the 14th century. The same flower appears on one side of older silver ingots from central Java; the other side is stamped with a flowing vase design, which is never found on coins. The observe of the sandalwood flower coins are stamped with the nagari character ma (abbreviation of masa). Unlike the gold coins, the silver coins changed rapidly. In only one century, the character ma degenerated very quickly, perhaps because it is different with the Javanese Kawi letter for ma. The shape also changed; in the early 10th-century, the shape of one masa changed from a thick and flat coin to a thin and cup-shaped coin. The silver coins were presumably served as small change. The silver coins were probably created by smiths in the market for use in market transactions. In Java, beginning at the end of the 10th-century and onwards, more and more Chinese copper coins were imported in greater quantities, as well as Chinese cash and local copies, known as pisis. These coins began to displace the silver alloy coins as small denomination currency. By the mid-14th century, there were so many pisis in circulation, that the Javanese court recognized them as official currency for tax purposes. Sumatran coins In Sumatra, coins were first minted in the 11th-century. Similar sandalwood flower coins like those in Java were discovered in Sumatra, but more of these were made of gold, electrum, and silver alloys. Several 11th- century sites in Sumatra including Barus, Bengkulu, and Muara Jambi were abundant in gold coins, while silver is rare. Similar coins were also found in South Thailand. The Sumatran silver alloy examples are very well made compared with the Javanese silver coins. Curiously, no coins have been found at Palembang, said to be the center of the Sriwijayan economy. This suggests that coins may have had a limited role in the early Sriwijayan economy. International trades might have been conducted either through the mechanism known as tributary trade or in other form known as administered trade. In administered trade system, equivalencies were established between commodities through diplomatic negotiations rather than bargaining. Legacy The gold piloncitos of the Philippines are a late offshoot of the Indonesian gold coinage, while the bean-like silver \\"namo\\" series of the Malay peninsula was presumably an offshoot of the silver and may have evolved into the bullet (Pod-Duang) coinage of Sukhothai in Thailand.

The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) was the most prominent militant suffrage organisation in the United Kingdom until the start of World War I. However, on the outbreak of war, the WSPU leader Christabel Pankhurst decided to suspend suffrage campaigning, and instead focus on support for the war. Many members of the organisation disagreed with the decision, with some forming the breakaway Suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union in 1915. A further breakaway took place in March 1916, led by Charlotte Marsh, a former organiser for the WSPU. She founded the \\"Independent Women's Social and Political Union\\", and launched a journal, the Independent Suffragette. Other leading members included Edith Rigby, who founded a branch in Preston, Lancashire, and Dorothy Evans, who served as its provincial organiser. The group was very hostile to Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst, but while it did not share the WSPU's patriotism, it did not oppose the war.

Early life Born Nancy Mary Schilling in 1930 in the lake resort town of Minocqua, Wisconsin, Jane Schilling was the eldest of five children of Lyle Franklin Schilling, a dentist, and wife, Rosalie Julia Wolk Schilling, a homemaker. Early on, Nancy excelled in athletics and scholarship. Finding that her high school did not offer the courses she needed to take in order to become a dentist like her father, she moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin to live with two aunts to attend St. Joseph's Academy for junior and senior high school. During this period, she found that she had a vocation to follow in the footsteps of her teachers and become a Sister of St. Joseph of Carondolet.Tribute to Sr. Jane Schilling. 2015 Martin University Founders Day Luncheon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBVrj1JPH8gFern (Snooks) Winger, telephone interview, October 31, 2014, digital tape and typescript, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.Jane Jelinski, written responses to interview questions, November 9, 2014, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society. During her formation with the Sisters of St. Joseph, she received the name Sister Jane Edward, a combination of her younger sister's and brother's names. An avid scholar, she received her bachelor's degree in European and American History at Fontbonne University in Saint Louis and her Master's of Ancient History at Loyola University in Chicago. Following her first assignment as a teacher in St. Rita's School in St. Louis, she was next assigned to St. Matthew's School in the inner city. Here, she developed a passion for civil rights and social justice. She assisted with curriculum development for students at the Saint Louis hospital for black residents, Homer G. Phillips, and assisted in ministering to ex-convicts at nearby Dismas House, established by Father Charles \\"Dismas\\" Clark and Morris Shenker. Holy Angels In 1964, Schilling's was assigned to teach at Holy Angels Catholic School in Indianapolis, Indiana, a school that had transitioned to a majority black student population. She embraced this role with high energy, establishing a drum and bugle corps to increase school pride and visibility within the community. After she was named principal, she engaged in implementing educational reforms of the time, such as open classrooms, right/left brain teaching, and psychomotor approaches for teaching reading.Ferdye Bryant, Margaret Graves, and Doris Parker, ‚ÄúA New Journey of Hope: Holy Angels Catholic Church, 1903-2003‚Äù (Indianapolis: Holy Angels Catholic Church, 2003), 36.Sr. Pat Quinn, CSJ, telephone interview, April 29, 2015, digital tape and typescript, Father Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society.\\"Sister Jane Edward Schilling,\\" biography, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis Province, http://www.csjsl.org/news/sister- jane-edward-schilling-1930-2017.php Shortly after her arrival at Holy Angels, Schilling's life was radically changed when a new Associate Pastor at Holy Angels Parish, Boniface Hardin, arrived on the scene. The two shared a commitment to education and social change, a bond that created a partnership that would last for the remainder of their lives. Working together, Schilling and Hardin became activists in church and community reform. They fought police brutality and targeting of black citizens, de facto school segregation, lack of representation of black clergy and traditions within the Catholic Church, poverty, and unfair housing practices. A key focus became the fight to prevent a major highway, Interstate 65, from bifurcating the predominately black northwest neighborhood surrounding Holy Angels Parish.‚ÄúCORE Threatens Protest in Planned Highway Controversy,‚Äù Indianapolis Recorder, February 10, 1968.‚ÄúSeek Lawsuit to Halt Construction of Highway thru Negro Community,‚Äù Indianapolis Recorder, February 3, 1968. When police pressure on the Archbishop of Indianapolis, Paul Schulte, triggered a decision to remove Hardin from Holy Angels Parish in 1969, parishioners rose up and staged a nationally publicized demonstration in Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral where the Archbishop was presiding at Easter services.\\"150 Walk Out in a Protest at Indianapolis Cathedral,‚Äù The New York Times, April 7, 1969.\\"Demonstrators Protest Treatment of Priest,‚Äù Indianapolis Recorder, April 12, 1969. Although the Archbishop rescinded his order, Hardin left Holy Angels to found Martin Center, an educational and social justice center, at the close of 1969. Within a year, Schilling received permission from her religious community to work full-time at Martin Center as Education Coordinator. The Martin Center Martin Center was named for Martin Luther King Jr. and St. Martin de Porres, patron saint, within the Catholic Church, of poor and mixed race people. Its mission evolved from an initial goal of educating clergy and white people about discriminatory attitudes and practices to include celebrating black cultural heritage and engaging black community members in activism and self- identity. While Hardin traveled as a speaker and consultant to raise funds for the Center, Schilling became the day-to-day administrator. Drawing on her background as a history scholar, Schilling did the research and production of designs and materials for workshops, speeches, and activities of Martin Center. Soon, the mission of the Center expanded to include the Martin Sickle Cell Center, which received major national funding to educate the community and screen for this disease, and the Afro-American Institute, which focused on African and African-American culture and achievements.\\"Martin Center‚Äôs success is vehicle by Father Boniface,‚Äù Indianapolis Recorder, March 11, 1972 Schilling served as Director of Community Education at the Sickle Cell Center from 1970 to 1977 and received its award for 25 Years of Dedication to Sickle Cell and Visionary Leadership.Father Kenneth Taylor, ‚ÄúSister Jane Schilling: A Model of Faith,‚Äù Indianapolis Recorder, September 28, 2017. http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/religion/article_bb7767ce-a454-11e7-8ce7-13f0c08e208e.html Through the Afro-American Institute, Martin Center housed a library of materials and artifacts, created and acquired by Schilling and Hardin. They also produced a regular scholarly periodical, the Afro-American Journal (1973‚Äì78);Collections of the Afro-American Journal are in the Indiana University libraries, the Indiana State Library, the Indianapolis Public Library, and the Boniface Hardin Collection, Indiana Historical Society. two full-length TV documentaries‚ÄîThe Kingdom Builders and For Love of FreedomBoth films are available in their original Betamax format and DVD.

Schilling co-hosted these programs and was the major researcher behind the productions. As Martin Center expanded its educational offerings to the community, it collaborated with Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis to create courses for college credit. This venture led Schilling and Hardin to found Indiana's only minority serving institution, Martin University. Martin University From the start, Schilling's role in the creation and growth of Martin University was chief academic officer, strategist, and educational developer. As Founding Vice President for Academic Affairs, she was a key voice in articulating the philosophy behind the institution, inspired by the concept of ‚Äúandragogy‚Äù advanced by Malcolm Knowles. The approach emphasized drawing on the strengths and past experience of adult learners, the major population of the university. Through her hiring decisions and curriculum and faculty development efforts, Schilling collaborated with Hardin to become the guiding force behind the school's educational direction. Schilling presided over Academic Affairs at Martin University from its early beginnings with a handful of students in 1977 as Martin Center College, through 1979 as Martin College became a separate entity from Martin Center, and finally through 1990, when the addition of graduate programs enabled the change to Martin University, a school with nearly 1000 students. She was the key architect of successful accreditation and expansion proposals to the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (changed in 2014 to the Higher Learning Commission). She became known at Martin for her sense of humor and the compassion she showed students through acts such as serving soup to those who came directly from work to classes. While Vice President of Martin University, Schilling participated in numerous initiatives within the Indianapolis community, including serving on the Crispus Attucks Museum Committee and acting as consultant and workshop facilitator for the Indianapolis Public Schools. She continued to guide the Martin Center, serving as its Executive Director from 1984 to 1988. Schilling received a number of Martin University Awards. These included the Mary McLeod Bethune Award and the Martin University Board of Trustees Wind Under Our Wings Award. In 2005, she received the Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Martin University. After 30 years of service, Schilling retired from Martin University in 2007. She died on September 13, 2017 at Nazareth Living House, Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet, St. Louis.

Her death came eighteen days before she was due to appear as chief witness in the trial of Tony Murphy; the case against him subsequently collapsed. The police gave her cause of death as \\"barbiturate intoxication\\", and the State Coroner declined to investigate further, as police advised there were \\"no suspicious circumstances\\". Brifman's family believed she had been murdered, and her husband ensured that her body was buried rather than cremated in case an exhumation was required. Allegations of murder were raised at the Fitzgerald Inquiry in the late 1980s, but no action was taken. However, Brifman's daughter Mary Anne continued to lobby the Queensland government for a further investigation, and in January 2017 the Attorney-General, Yvette D'Ath, announced that the State Coroner would \\"make further inquiries\\" into her death and \\"determine whether an inquest should be held\\".Shirley Brifman: Coroner to investigate whether inquest should be done into 1972 death of Brisbane brothel madam, ABC News, 19 January 2017.

In a functional bioactive terrarium, the waste products will be broken down by these detritivores, reducing or eliminating the need for cage cleaning. Bioactive vivariums are used by zoos and hobbyists to house reptiles and amphibians in an aesthetically pleasing and enriched environment. Enclosure Any terrarium can be made bioactive by addition of the appropriate substrate, plants, and detritivores. Bioactive enclosures are often maintained as display terraria constructed of PVC, wood, glass and/or acrylic. Bioactive enclosures in laboratory \\"rack\\" style caging are uncommon. Cleanup crew 249x249pxWaste products of the primary species are consumed by a variety of detritivores, referred to as the \\"cleanup crew\\" by hobbyists. These can include woodlice, springtails, earthworms, millipedes, and various beetles, with different species being preferred in different habitats - the cleanup crew for a tropical rainforest bioactive terrarium may rely primarily on springtails, isopods, and earthworms, while a desert habitat might use beetles. If the primary species is insectivorous, they may consume the cleanup crew, and thus the cleanup crew must have sufficient retreats to avoid being completely depopulated. Additionally, bioactive terraria typically have a flourishing population of bacteria and other microorganisms which break down the wastes of the cleanup crew and primary species. Fungi may occur as part of the terrarium cycle and will be consumed by the cleanup crew. Substrate Golden Pothos (241x241px Bioactive enclosures require some form of substrate to grow plants and to provide habitat for the cleanup crew. The choice of substrate is typically determined by the habitat of the primary species (e.g. jungle vs desert), and created by mixing a variety of components such as organic topsoil (free of pesticides and non-biological fertilizers), peat, coco fiber, sand, long-fiber sphagnum moss, cypress mulch, and orchid bark in varying proportions. In wet habitats, there is typically a drainage layer beneath the substrate to allow water to pool without saturating the substrate. The drainage layer may be constructed via coarse gravel, stones, expanded clay aggregate, or may be wholly synthetic; the drainage layer is typically separated from the overlying substrate with a fine plastic mesh. Additionally, some bioactive terraria include leaf-litter, which can serve as food and microhabitat for the cleanup crew. Plants The use of live plants in a bioactive terrarium provides cover for animals inhabiting the enclosure, is aesthetically pleasing in a display enclosure, and can help to absorb nitrogenous wastes that could otherwise build up in a system. Providing a variety of plants that will grow in and be clipped back during maintenance provides hiding spots for terrarium inhabitants that change over time. This is a form of enrichment recommended for keeping reptiles.

Her home was a meeting place where information could be exchanged and the issues of the day discussed. In 1823 she was one of the founders of the famous philanthropic society Sociedad de Beneficencia de Buenos Aires and served as its first president. Family Mar√≠a Josefa de las Mercedes Lasala Fern√°ndez Larrazabal was born in Buenos Aires on 23 September 1764 and baptised two days later. She was from an old patrician family. Her father was Jean Baptiste de La Salle Bachaulet (8 February 1729 ‚Äì c. 1780), originally from Monein, Bearn, France. Her mother was Juana Agustina Fernandez de la Cruz Larrazabal, born on 5 May 1741 in Buenos Aires. Mercedes was the second oldest of a family of at least 10 children. Her youngest sister was Maria Eusebia Rafaela Jossefa (1774‚Äì1854). On 13 April 1782 Mercedes de Lasala married Miguel Ferm√≠n Mariano Riglos San Mart√≠n (12 October 1754 ‚Äì 16 May 1808) in Buenos Aires. He was a captain of dragoons in the Fixed Regiment. Their children were Miguel Francisco Xavier Juli√°n Buenaventura (17 February 1783), Josefa Rosa Mercedes Dionisia (2 March 1784 ‚Äì 5 Jan 1873), Miguel Jos√© Sabelio (9 January 1790 ‚Äì 20 Nov 1863), Jos√© Ram√≥n Francisco (1 April 1791), Mart√≠n Marcos Jos√© (12 November 1793), Ram√≥n Doroteo Ignacio (6 February 1795), Jos√© Mart√≠n Ram√≥n Buenaventura (30 January 1797 ‚Äì 22 February 1839) and Francisca Javiera (died 28 July 1862). Her husband died in 1809. Support for independence movement Mercedes was known among the ladies of Buenos Aires for her determined patriotism. She belonged to the Patricias Argentinas, a group of female financiers who contributed in financing the Argentine War of Independence in 1812. Her sister, Eusebia de Lasala, was part of the commission that interviewed Cornelio Saavedra and convinced him to participate in the freedom movement. In 1810 Mercedes contributed three ounces of gold to support the First Upper Peru campaign. Eusebia contributed one ounce of gold. Tertulias Mercedes de Riglos was among the well-to-do women of Buenos Aires who held weekly social gatherings that were open to anyone introduced by a friend. Similar tertulias were being held during this period in Lima, Peru, by women such as Manuela R√°bago de Avellafuertes de Riglos and Narcisa Arias de Saavaedra. It was at meetings at her house and those of other society women such as Mariquita S√°nchez de Thompson and Flora Azcu√©naga that the discussions were held which led up to the May Revolution, the first stage in the struggle for Argentine independence from Spain. William Parish Robertson, an English merchant, visited Buenos Aires around the end of 1817. He wrote much later, \\"Madame Riglos\\" could be seen as the chief lady of the conservative faction in Buenos Aires. She was sparkling and familiar, although highly aristocratic. Her house was the meeting place of government figures. She was popular with English naval officers because of her patience in correcting their linguistic errors and her willingness to defend them against criticism for their sad figure in the local dances. Do√±a Melchora de Sarratea, queen of fashion and of the Buenos Aires salons, was so well aware of public and private affairs that she was held to be an enthusiastic supporter of Whig (liberal) principles. Mariquita S√°nchez de Thompson's forte was foreign relations. She had great wealth and collected outstanding personalities and also exquisite and curious products of European art and industry such as porcelains, engravings and clocks. Charity Mercedes Lasala was one of the founders of the Sociedad de Beneficencia (Charity Society) created by Bernardino Rivadavia in 1823. She was the first president of the society, holding office until January 1827. The society ran public institutions to help women and children, and played an important role in female education. She worked to promote the society until her death. Mercedes de Lasala de Riglos died in Buenos Aires on 1 January 1837. Balc√≥n de Riglos Mercedes Lasala de Riglos's son, Miguel de Riglos y Lasala, was educated in London and returned to Buenos Aires in February 1813 at the age of 21. Don Miguel de Riglos y Lasala was known as the \\"English Lord\\". On 11 February 1825 Colonel Manuel de Escalada sold a house on the Plaza de la Victoria to Miguel de Riglos y Lasala as agent of his brother-in- law Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, who was absent in Europe. The house had been given to San Mart√≠n by the state on 16 August 1819, and was sold for $20,000 cash. It was a few meters from the Buenos Aires Cabildo. It came to be known as the \\"Balc√≥n de Riglos\\". Others called it called \\"Los Altos\\". Miguel and his wife Do√±a Dolores Villanueva furnished the house with all the luxury and comfort of the time. For more than 30 years the long and narrow balcony of the house was the place from which the best society viewed every parade or procession.

Structure  The adult female parasite consists of a body that can be differentiated into two distinct regions: a sac-like structure containing the reproductive organs (the externa), and a trophic, root like system situated inside the hosts body (the interna). It forms an elongated, sac-like growth on the abdomen of several shrimp species, measuring up to 1.2 centimeters in diameter. S. hippolytes castrates infected female shrimp by absorbing the reproductive energy of the host. Many other Rhizocephalan have the same castrating characteristic. The presence of the parasite will eventually come to pass after it dies, and the castrating mechanism is reversed for the host.  Life cycle  Sylon hippolytes typically lives up to a maximum of one year.  Reproduction  Sylon hippolytes are r-strategists. An externa can only produce offspring once during its lifetime. Therefore, the parasite utilizes an enormous amount of energy towards producing as many eggs as possible for reproduction. The size of the parasitic sac has proportional relationship with the size of its host. When S. hippolytes infect smaller hosts, the number of eggs produced can range from 1400 to 22000. As expected, when the parasite infects larger hosts, the range of eggs is larger, ranging from 19000 to one million eggs. This process requires a male cypris larva to penetrate the integument of the externa and deposit spermatogonia cells into the receptacles of the female externa.

Known for her watercolor paintings of landscapes and villages in Nova Scotia, Zwicker exhibited her work at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, the Montreal Art Association, and the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. Together with her husband, Leroy Zwicker, she owned and operated Zwicker's Gallery; for most of the 20th century, Zwicker's Gallery was the only Halifax gallery that routinely held art exhibits open to the public. It still operates.  Biography  Marguerite Porter was born in 1904 in Pleasant Valley, Yarmouth. She studied painting at the Nova Scotia College of Art, and also traveled to the United States to study privately with German-American abstract expressionist painter Hans Hofmann. In 1928, as a senior student at the Nova Scotia College of Art, Porter had one of her etchings accepted by the Society of Canadian Painters, Etchers and Engravers. That same year, she began teaching classes at the College, earning an annual salary of $600 for the next two years. In 1937, she married a fellow art student named Leroy Zwicker. Zwicker taught painting at Acadia University in Wolfville and eventually led \\"painting and cultural tours\\" in countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. She became known for her watercolor paintings of Nova Scotia landscapes and villages, and she exhibited her work at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and the Montreal Art Association. Zwicker was a member of the Nova Scotia Society of Artists. In 1957, Zwicker and her husband became owners of Zwicker's Gallery, the longest-running art store and commercial gallery in Halifax. Zwicker's Gallery had been established in 1886 by a member of Leroy's family, and up until the 1970s it was the only gallery in Halifax that routinely held art exhibits open to the public; the gallery was a valuable outlet for local artists. The Zwickers continued to operate the gallery themselves until 1968, after which it passed into new ownership. In 1959, Zwicker published a book entitled On My Own, in which she reflected on her European travels. Both Zwicker and her husband were patrons of the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (AGNS) after its establishment. During the 1980s, as AGNS fought to obtain funding to conserve and exhibit the house of Canadian folk artist Maude Lewis, the Zwickers offered a private donation of $4 million in support of the project. In 1991, Zwicker held a solo exhibit of her work at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. Zwicker died in 1993 in Halifax.  Education  Throughout the 19th century respectable women often enrolled themselves in finishing school instruction. Here, women practiced 'polite', ladylike activities such as music, embroidery, and watercolour painting. The Victoria School of Art and Design (VSAD), located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was an exemplary institution of proper female art education. Today the VSAD is known as the Nova Scotia College of Art. Marguerite Zwicker graduated from the Nova Scotia College of Art in 1928. After graduating she was hired at the college and taught there for two years as a junior teacher. Zwicker taught under Principal Elizabeth S. Nutt, a well-known art supporter of the time. Between the years 1931 and 1933, Zwicker taught at Acadia University in exchange for room and board. While teaching at Acadia, she took a one-month art workshop with Stanly Royle in 1932. Zwicker learned colour values and the importance of dramatic contrast from Royle. This workshop gave Zwicker new artistic inspiration as she was enlightened by Royle's views on art. Throughout Royle's month-long workshop, Zwicker began to develop her own style of painting. When Zwicker finished teaching at Acadia University, she took a break from her painting education. It wasn't until 1961 that she resumed her studies at summer painting schools in both Cape Cod and Florida. Classes were instructed by Mr. Elliot O'Hara, a famous American watercolourist. Zwicker learned the importance of painting on site from O'Hara. Zwicker's travels were purposeful to further both her artistic studies as well as her cultural experiences.  Career  Zwicker traveled to Europe on sketching trips with fellow Nova Scotian artists. During her own time, she also traveled extensively in Europe, the West Indies, the United States, and across Canada. Zwicker used her travels as an opportunity to study and practice her craft. In 1959 Zwicker ventured to Europe where she recorded her experiences in a journal. To accompany her writing, Zwicker drew ink illustrations in her text. Upon returning home, Zwicker printed one hundred copies of her book and distributed it among her friends. The final product of her book was titled On My Own. During the European trip that inspired her book, Zwicker fell in love with Italy. She later returned to the country with sixty students, leading them on a cultural tour of painting, studying, and sightseeing between the years of 1962 and 1965. Zwicker typically painted three watercolours a week. Only a handful of Nova Scotian artists were able to support themselves on painting alone, and Zwicker became one of these such artists. Few Nova Scotian artists have been as popular as Zwicker became during her career. Zwicker believed in the idea of \\"art for the sake of art\\". Between 1933 and 1937, Zwicker used her studio shop in Yarmouth as a place to make and sell her art, but also as a space for art appreciation. One of Zwicker's most notable accomplishments was the work she completed for Canada's first art magazine, Maritime Art. Between 1880 and 1950, several art schools were founded including: the Victoria School of Art and Design, the Nova Scotia Museum of Fine Arts, the Nova Scotia Society of Artists (NSSA) and the Maritime Art Association (MAA). The increasing number of art institutions created more opportunities for artists to show their works publicly. Zwicker was a member and regularly exhibited her paintings with the NSSA, the MAA, and the Halifax Department of Education. In the United States, Zwicker showed works with the California Watercolour Society. On a national scale, she exhibited works with the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, as well as the Montreal Art Association. Additionally, Zwicker conducted several solo exhibitions of her own works. As a personal rule, Zwicker did not keep track of the work she sold to customers. This lack of documentation has made it difficult for Zwicker's work to be researched on a scholarly level.  Medium  Marguerite Zwicker's artwork is almost exclusively watercolour. Technique, composition, and design are all emphasized as important structural components of Zwicker's watercolours. Her compositions primarily display the houses of Nova Scotia or landscape scenes of her home province. Zwicker's watercolour images commonly contrast transpaecny with an intense purity of colour. It was Zwicker's opinion that \\"watercolour should never be resevered for quick preliminary sketches, nor necessarily should it be viewed as a more limited medium in range than oil.\\" Her paintings are often viewed as an example of the medium at its most developed point of artistry. Watercolour was typically noted as a \\"woman's medium\\" for its lighter, more expressive appearance. However, laying down pigment suspended in water required a confidence not all artists were able to successfully possess. Zwicker herself was quoted saying, \\"Anyone can paint in watercolour, but very few can paint watercolours well.\\"  Marriage  Marguerite Porter married Leroy Zwicker (1906‚Äì1987) in 1937. Marguerite continued to pursue cultural activities while married to Leroy. From early on in their marriage, Marguerite and Leroy agreed that creating art was the most important value within their relationship. It was a hobby and career they both enjoyed, which led them to organize their lives around their production of art. Leroy was also a successful painter, and his artwork was featured in many of the same exhibitions as Marguerite's. The pair would travel on weekend sketching trips together. Zwicker and her husband ran Granville Gallery in Halifax between 1942 and 1969. Later in life, Marguerite and Leroy owned the only art venue in Halifax that regularly featured public art exhibitions. It became known as \\"Zwicker's Gallery\\" and was a major accomplishment for them both. From 1974 onward, Leroy became increasingly ill and he died in 1987. Marguerite continued painting up until her own death in 1993.  Exhibitions  Although the majority of Zwicker's paintings were exhibited within Nova Scotia, she also showed her works in travelling exhibitions across Canada, the United States, and Europe. Landscape motifs were known to dominate Nova Scotian art exhibitions in the 1920s and 1930s. Ten Nova Scotian Women In the Fall of 1983, the Killiam Lecture Committee at Dalhousie University approached a Nova Scotian art gallery with the idea for an exhibition. The exhibition would show artwork painted by ten Nova Scotian women artists, highlighting their careers. Each artist featured in this show, including Marguerite Zwicker, had made significant contributions to the heritage of art creation within the province of Nova Scotia. As this exhibition primarily showcased little known or uncatalogued female artists, the greatest challenge was locating and collecting their art works. The goal of Ten Nova Scotian Women was to bring local female artists into the spotlight and encourage the rediscovery of their paintings. The exhibition focused on art created by the ten women between 1880 and 1955. Works by Marguerite Zwicker exhibited in Ten Nova Scotian Women include: * Portrait, watercolour, 30.5 x 38.0, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia * Untitled (Old Sackville Church), watercolour, 24.1 x 23.1, Fine Art Collection, Public Archives of Nova Scotia * Tranquility, watercolour, 44.6 x 58.5, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia * Gorsebrook, 1949, watercolour, 38.1 x 55.9, Fine Art Collection, Public Archives of Nova Scotia Nova Scotian Pictures This exhibition was put on in 1946 by the Halifax Department of Education. This annual exhibition traveled province-wide to approximately one hundred towns and villages. When the exhibition closed it had been seen by 35,000 Nova Scotians. Marguerite Zwicker was asked to feature some of her new paintings in this exhibition. Tony Saulnier Exhibition Tony Saulnier was a dedicated patron of the arts and devoted a great deal of his time and energy to building his own collection of art. He was especially interested in the art of female Atlantic Canadian artists. Saulnier created an exhibition that gave the public a chance to see a selection of works hand-picked from his own collection. He specifically called upon Zwicker, asking her for new works that he could include in his exhibit. Throughout the coming year Saulnier would continue to request artwork from Zwicker. His favourites were her large floral watercolours, several of which lined the hallways in his home for many years. Three of Zwicker's works featured in Saulnier's Exhibition were: * At the Arm, 1936, oil on board, 39.5 x 50.0 * Delphiniums, c. 1985, watercolour on paper, 70.3 x 52.8 * Calla Lilies, 1940, watercolour on paper, 30.5 x 40.5 Spring Exhibition The Spring Exhibition was put on annually by the Art Association of Montreal. Landscapes were a favoured subject matter in this exhibition. Zwicker showed her watercolours in this exhibition almost every year. In some years, both Marguerite and Leroy exhibited their works. Art Gallery of Nova Scotia In 1991, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia developed an exhibition solely around the works of Marguerite Zwicker. The show was meant to pay tribute to Zwicker, acknowledging her long career. Bernard Riordon was the AGNS director and a personal friend of Zwicker's. When Zwicker passed away in 1993, Riordon commented, \\"Marguerite Zwicker was a role model ... the enthusiasm, energy, and public spirtiedness she exhibited in all her endeavors will be missed.\\"  References   External links  * https://www.zwickersgallery.ca/Artists/20thCenturyArt/ArtistsSZ/MargueriteZwicker.aspx * https://www.mutualart.com/Artist/Mary-Marguerite-Porter- Zwicker/1B583D02C0889F54 1904 births 1993 deaths Artists from Nova Scotia Canadian watercolourists Women watercolorists Canadian art dealers Canadian patrons of the arts NSCAD University alumni 20th-century Canadian women artists 20th-century philanthropists ","title":"Marguerite Porter Zwicker"},{"id":"55932126","text":"Jungle Creations is a British digital media company that operates themed channels including VT, Twisted, Lovimals, Level Fitness, Craft Factory and Four Nine.

Currently, there is very little conclusive research available regarding cat cognition as standardized tests for evaluating cognitive ability are less established and less reliable than cognitive testing apparatus used in other mammalian species, like dogs. Much of what is known about feline cognition has been inferred from a combination of owner-reported behaviour, brain necropsies, and comparative cognitive neurology of related animal models. Cognition claims appear primarily on kitten diets which include elevated levels of nutrients associated with optimal brain development, although there are now diets available for senior cats that include nutrients to help slow the progression of age-related changes and prevent cognitive decline. Cognition diets for cats contain a greater portion of omega-3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and usually feature a variety of antioxidants and other supporting nutrients thought to have positive effects on cognition. Omega-3 fatty acids The omega-3 fatty acids are a key nutrient in cognition for felines. They are essential for felines as they cannot be synthesized naturally and must be obtained from the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids that support brain development and function are alpha- linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Fish oils, fish and other marine sources provide a very rich source of DHA and EPA. Alpha-linolenic acid can be acquired from oils and seeds. In kittens and juvenile felines, omega-3 fatty acids are very important for the development of the brain, components of the nervous system and retinal accretion. It was found in a study by Pawlosky et al. (1997), when pregnant domestic felines were fed a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids that their offspring showed high levels of DHA in brain and retinal tissues. In the group that fed low concentrations of omega-3 fatty acid and omega-6 fatty acid, their kittens had extremely low amounts of DHA in these tissues which shows that young felines, have poor biosynthetic ability to produce these fatty acids. This study also showed hindered brain waves in kittens whose mother were fed low omega-3 and omega-6 diets which is a significant indicator, that these fatty acids aid in the development of the feline brain at a juvenile stage. Though young felines are not efficient at producing omega-3 fatty acids naturally, it is critical for cognitive function and brain development in regard to brain waves and glucose uptake. Felines, like other obligate carnivores, possess a small concentration of delta 6 desaturase which is an enzyme that converts omega-3 fatty acids such as alpha linolenic acid into DHA. This is what causes the poor bioavailability of essential fatty acids in felines, and why it is crucial in their diet. Omega-3 fatty acid also aids in uptake of glucose in the brain which is needed for energy for cognitive health. Though no studies in cats have been completed, it was found that rats with low levels of omega-3 fatty acids resulted in a decrease of glucose uptake in the brain. Recommended DHA and EPA concentrations have not been yet determined for cats in present day.AAFCO (2014) AAFCO Dog and Cat Food Nutrient Profiles. Pet Food Report: Proposed Revisions Edited per Comments 2014 Official Publication. Retrieved November 24th 2017 from: http://www.aafco.org/Portals/0/SiteContent/Regulatory/Committees/Pet- Food/Reports/Pet_Food_Report_2013_Midyear Proposed_Revisions_to_AAFCO_Nutrient_Profiles.pdf According to AAFCO Dog and Cat Food Nutrient Profiles (2014), DHA and EPA the minimum amount for the growth and reproduction in cat food is 0.0012% on a dry matter basis or 0.03g per 1000 kcal ME per day. Alpha-linolenic acid, was recommended at 0.02% on a dry matter basis and 0.05g per 1000 kcal ME per day. Omega-6 fatty acids Omega-6 fatty acids are also needed in feline cognition diets. The important omega-6 fatty acid that plays a role in brain support and cognition is arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid or AA is found in animal sources such as meat and eggs. AA is required in cat diets, as felines convert insignificant amounts of it from linoleic acid due to the limited delta-6 desaturase. Like DHA, arachidonic acid is often found in the brain tissues of cats and seems to have a supporting role in brain function. In a 2000 study completed by Contreras et al., it was found that DHA and AA made up 20% of the fatty acids in the mammalian brain. Arachidonic acid makes up high amounts in the membrane of most cells and has many pro-inflammatory actions. Recommended arachidonic acid concentrations have not been yet determined for cats in present-day but minimum requirements have been established. According to AAFCO Dog and Cat Food Nutrient Profiles (2014), the minimum amount of AA for the growth and reproduction in cat food is 0.02% on a dry matter basis or 0.05g per 1000 kcal ME per day. The minimum of adult maintenance in cats is 0.02% on a dry matter basis or 0.05g per 1000 kcal ME per day. Taurine Taurine is an amino acid, which is essential in cat diets due to their low capacity to synthesize it. Because of taurine has the ability to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier in the brain, it has been found to have a role in many neurological functions, especially in the visual development. Without taurine, felines can have an abnormal morphology in the cerebellum and visual cortex. When cats were fed a diet deficient in taurine, this leads to a decrease in the concentration of taurine in the retina of the eye. This results in deterioration of the photoreceptors, followed by complete blindness. Based on AAFCO Dog and Cat Food Nutrient Profiles (2014), the minimum amount of taurine for the growth and reproduction in cat food is 0.10% (extruded) and 0.20% (canned) on a dry matter basis and 0.25g (extruded) and 0.50g (canned) per 1000 kcal ME per day. For minimum adult maintenance, taurine is recommended at 0.10% (extruded) and 0.20% (canned) on a dry matter basis and 0.25g (extruded) and 0.50g (canned) per 1000 kcal ME per day. Vitamins = Vitamin B = There are 8 water soluble B vitamins: thiamine (B1), h riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folate (B9) and cobolamin (B12), all of which play a direct or indirect role in energy metabolism and cellular functions.Kennedy, D.O. (2016) B Vitamins and the Brain: Mechanisms, Dose and Efficacy ‚Äì A Review. Nutrients. 8(2), 68-97. The role of each vitamin in mammalian cognitive processes has been well researched, and due to similar deficiency symptoms across species, it is generally accepted that the B vitamins have similar functions in analogous mammalian brains. It has been found that cats fed supporting nutrients, including B vitamins, saw significantly greater cognitive benefits than cats fed only to meet the minimum requirement.  Thiamine (B1)  Thiamine serves several indispensable roles in the brain that affect cognitive function either directly or indirectly. It is a functional component of neuronal and microglial cell membranes, and serves as a modulator of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter system. Thiamine indirectly drives cognitive processes as a necessary cofactor in the pathways needed to synthesise fatty acids, steroid hormones, nucleic acids and precursory molecules for various compounds involved in brain function. It has been shown that cats suffer irreversible brain damage when deprived of thiamine that hinders memory and learning even after thiamine has been reintroduced to the diet.  Riboflavin (B2)  Riboflavin molecules are required to produce flavoprotein coenzymes, which are the rate limiting component of several important biological processes required for optimal cognitive function. Flavoproteins drive reactions for the synthesis of proteins involved with electron transport, oxygen transport, vasodilation and the other b vitamins niacin, folate and cobalamin. Riboflavin also exhibits powerful antioxidant effects through its role in the glutathione redox cycle, particularly with regard to protection against lipid peroxidation, which is associated with brain aging and cognitive disorders.Ashoori, M. and Saedisomeolia, A. (2014) Riboflavin (vitamin B2) and oxidative stress: a review. Br J Nutr. 111, 1985-1991.  Pantothenic acid (B5)  Pantothenic acid is precursory to biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), which is not only required for cellular respiration, but also serves a role in the synthesis of structural and functional brain cell components such as cholesterol, amino acids, fatty acids and phospholipids. Vitamin B5 also plays a more direct role in cognitive function by participating in the synthesis of steroid hormones and neurotransmitters.  Pyridoxine (B6)  Pyridoxine is an indispensable cofactor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, melatonin, dopamine, gama-aminobutyric acid, adrenaline and noradrenaline, and even slight deficiencies can lead to cognitive impairments in humans. Pyridoxine deficiencies have been linked to abnormal sleep and behaviour patterns through downregulation of neurotransmitters and secretion of regulatory hormones in the hypothalamus and pituitary. =Vitamin A= Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that occurs in three forms; retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid. It is most well known for retinol‚Äôs imperative role in ensuring normal vision in mammals however retinoic acid is important in altering the expression of genes through nuclear receptors. The precursors for vitamin A are beta-carotenes which get converted to vitamin A, predominantly in the liver. Cats rely on preformed vitamin A in the diet as they are unable to carry out the conversion of beta-carotenes to vitamin A. Vitamin A recommendations are 6668 IU/kg for a feline in a growing or reproductive state and 3332 IU/kg for adult maintenance. A maximum vitamin A intake of 333,300 IU/kg has been implemented to ensure toxicity doesn't occur. Chronic vitamin A toxicity in felines is distinguished by the prevalence of new bone formation on already formed bone, specifically on the cervical vertebrae. This can cause stiffening of the joints, deformities as well as crippling within cats. =Vitamin E= Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin that plays an important role in the formation of cell membranes, cell respiration, and metabolism of fats. It is an antioxidant meaning it protects cells from oxidation. Natural sources of Vitamin E are primarily plant based and therefore cat diets with high amounts of raw protein, such as fish, need to be supplemented with Vitamin E. Vitamin E deficiencies have been well documented in both cats and dogs. Deficiencies of Vitamin E will result in cell damage and death in skeletal muscle, heart, testes, liver, and nerves. Inadequate Vitamin E can affect cells in the eye, making it one of the causes of retinal degeneration. It is essential to ensure the cat has a good quality of life to keep the cells of these organs alive and functioning. Steatitis or \\"yellow fat disease\\" has been noted when sources of highly unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., tuna fish oil, cod liver oil, and unrefined herring oil) have been provided in feline diets without the proper amounts of supplemental Vitamin E. There is no known vitamin E toxicity level in cats. Supplementation of vitamin E gives evidence for an improvement in an aging cat's functional lifespan. This refers to improvements in aspects of both physiology and brain health. As the brain ages, a natural decline in the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms result in the increased the vulnerability of the brain to the deleterious effects of oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The recommended minimum amount for both growth and reproduction diets and maintenance diets is 40 IU/kg. Choline and L-carnitine  Choline is a water-soluble nutrient that prevents and improves epilepsy and cognitive disorders. Supplementation is part of therapy for cats with seizures and kitty Alzheimer‚Äôs, despite this treatment being mostly based on anecdotal evidence and research done on dogs. It is the precursor to nerve chemicals like dopamine and acetylcholine, making it important for proper functioning of the nervous system. It also assists in the absorption of L-carnitine from the GI tract in rats, guinea pigs, and humans, although this has not been studied in cats specifically. L-carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound that transports long-chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm into the matrix of mitochondria to be oxidized for energy production, including mitochondria in the brain. Tanaka et al. (2004) studied rats since they are frequently used as models for mammalian physiology, and found that L-carnitine in the cerebral cortex of rats decreases with age. This indicates that supplementation of choline in seniors is particularly important to improve the uptake of L-carnitine, but further research using cats specifically has not been done. Choline is often supplemented in cat diets in the form of choline chloride, but is also found in eggs, liver, chicken, and soya as phosphatidylcholine. Free choline is in vegetables like cauliflower and dark leafy greens, and the choline metabolite betaine is found in beets and lecithin. The recommended minimum amount for both growth and reproduction diets and maintenance diets is 2400 mg/kg. = Folate (B9) and Cobolamin (B12) = Folate (aka Folic Acid) and Cobolamin are often grouped together, as vitamin B12 is made essential due to its role in cleaving methyltetrahydrofolate molecules to release active folate, without which a functional folate deficiency occurs [5]. Folate is required for the folate cycle, so deficiency prompts the down-regulation of nucleic acid production, consequently limiting DNA synthesis, and impairs DNA methylation reactions, leaving brain tissues vulnerable to damage [5]. Folate and cobolamin are also involved in the methionine cycle, which is responsible for methylation of the potentially neurotoxic amino acid homocysteine, converting it back into methionine [9]. In the face of a true or functional folate deficiency, homocysteine molecules circulate the blood, which are thought to accelerate brain aging and increase risk of cognitive disorders [5].  Supporting antioxidants  Zinc and copper are co-factors for superoxide dismutase to form Cu-Zn-SOD, an antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of superoxide radical into normal oxygen molecules or hydrogen peroxide by adding or removing an electron. A study by Webb et al. (2008) showed that increased SOD reduced oxidative stress and improved immunity in felines with FIV. The recommended minimum amount of zinc for growth and reproduction diets is 75 mg/kg, and is the same for maintenance diets. 15 mg/kg of copper is recommended as a minimum for extruded growth and reproduction diets, and is 8.4 mg/kg for canned diets. 5 mg/kg is recommended for maintenance diets regardless of food format. Manganese functions as a co-factor for another form of superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) that is only found within mitochondria, including those in the brain. For growth and reproduction diets and maintenance diets, a minimum of 7.6 mg/kg of manganese is recommended. Selenium is a major component of glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione peroxidases make up an enzyme family who reduce lipid hydroperoxides to their respective alcohols, and reduce free hydrogen peroxide to water to remove reactive oxygen species. They rely on the presence of selenium to fulfill their oxidative function. A minimum of 0.3 mg/kg of selenium is recommended for growth and reproduction diets and maintenance diets.  Cognitive nutritional deficiencies  = Central retinal degeneration = Central retinal deficiency is a cognitive dysfunction in cats that primarily caused by a nutritional deficiency but can be hereditary as well. However, because of improved nutritional health in recent years, the incidence of hereditary cases of this disease are seen less frequently. The retina, a thin layer of tissue in the back of the eye, is the structure affected by this disorder. This structure receives the light gathered and focused from the lens. It essentially take light and converts it into electrical nerve signals that the brain interprets as vision. The retina contains rods and cones which are photo-receptors that help the animal see (rods) and see certain colours (cones). Retinal degeneration can be caused by a taurine deficiency, which is why many cat foods are supplemented with taurine. Central retinal deficiency is irreversible but its effects can be significantly hindered by a diet supplemented with adequate amounts of taurine. Vitamin deficiencies in A and E can also lead to retinal degeneration in cats. Since photo-receptors develop early in life, it is critical that kittens are provided a diet which are supplemented with an appropriate amount of taurine and vitamins to promote proper development. = Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome = Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS), seen in both cats and dogs, is a progressive decline of cognitive abilities and subsequent behavioral changes associated with age-related pathologies more severe than would be expected in a healthy aging brain. CDS in cats is characterized by any combination of common, owner- reported behavioural changes associated with cognitive decline, such as increased attention seeking or aggression, disorientation and/or house- soiling, excessive meowing (often at night), altered sleep patterns, increased or decreased appetite, and increased or decreased activity. CDS diagnoses, however, are only made after all other potential causes for behavioural changes have been ruled out; only after death can an autopsy be performed to confirm the extent to which structural deterioration is responsible for the observed behaviours. Cognitive dysfunction syndrome in companion animals is commonly paralleled to Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease in humans due to several brain pathologies observed in both senior humans and senior pets. Necropsies and histological studies performed on the brains of humans with Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease and those performed on the brains of cats exhibiting signs of CDS both report hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, Œ≤-Amyloid aggregates deposited on the cerebral cortex, ‚Äòknotted‚Äô nerve fibers known as neurofibrillary tangles, and neuron loss in several different zones of the brain. The challenges of evaluating and tracking cognitive function in cats has led to very few trials investigating the effect of nutritional intervention on feline cognition, so as a result, many of the nutrients recommended to support cat cognition have been interpreted from human and canine cognitive support supplements. Reactive oxygen species, free radicals, are a primary cause of neurological damage in aged brains, due to the high rate of metabolic activity, high lipid content and limited regenerative capacity of the brain. It is recommended that for cognitive support as they age, senior cats receive a diet supplemented with anti-oxidants to prevent lipid peroxidation, omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA to support lipid membranes of brain cells and reduce inflammation, L-carnitine to aid mitochondrial efficiency, choline to support neurotransmission where neuron atrophy has occurred, and B vitamins, especially vitamin B12 and folic acid due to their role in the methionine cycle.

The over-eyelashes are continuous, as in the Bilzingsleben skull fragments of Homo erectus bilzingslebensis. The mastoid of the temporal bone is short as in Homo steinheimensis from the gravel pit at Steinheim an der Murr. The large, triangular bony tap on the temporal bone near the auditory canal is also present in skull no. 5 from the site Sima de los Huesos in Spain, the best preserved Homo heidelbergensis skull in the world. The Aroeira 3 skull, however, differs from this and the Homo steinheimensis by the absence of essential features that also occur in the early Neanderthals.Roberto S√°ez: Aroeira 3: The westernmost Middle Pleistocene cranium of Europe. Nutcracker Man, outreaching the human evolution research, 13. March 2017, retrieved on March 15, 2017 (English) Location The skull was found in a cave above the source of the Rio Almonda, a tributary of the Tagus, which lies in the karst landscape of the central limestone massif of the Portuguese Estremadura. The river forms an approximately 40-kilometer-long cut in the limestone massif with steep banks up to 70 meters in height. On these steep banks, there are various entrances to caves and cave systems that are partially collapsed or filled. Some caves have been excavated and explored. They are associated with human evolution during the Pleistocene and the cultural history during the Paleolithic. There are some cave systems used in the Upper Palaeolithic such as Entrada Superior, Entrada do Vale da Serra and Gruta da Aroeira. The Middle Palaeolithic is represented in the Gruta da Oliveira. Late Palaeolithic developments of the Solutrean and Magdalenian cultures can be found in the Galeria da Cisterna and the Lapa dos Coelhos.Jo√£o Zilh√£o, Diego E.

Proceedings of the European Society for the study of Human Evolution, 5, 2016, S. 253, Since 1978, the caves have been systematically explored, the first phase of the excavation work in the Cave of Aroeira lasted from 1998 until 2002. In addition to two early human teeth from the Acheulian industry (a canine and a molar, known as Aroeira 1 and Aroeira 2) were also found. The second phase of excavation, from 2013 to 2015, included the well-preserved skull Aroeira 3, but the hardness of the sediment in which it was embedded lead to damage during recovery and had it to be partially reconstructed. Age The age was assessed by uranium‚Äìthorium dating, whereby the age of the outer layer of the adjacent stalagmite was found to be 406,000 years within a range of 30,000 years. This is the upper limit because the stalagmite was later buried by boulders and mud masses and stopped growing. Calcite crusts on the skull itself were dated to 390,000 years (¬± 14,000 years).

In the 1920s he was an employee of the Munich magazine Der Gitarrenfreund.  Life and Work  Peter Harlan came from an artistic family. He was the son of writer Walter Harlan and brother of film director Veit Harlan (Jud S√º√ü). Recorder with German fingering. Note that the fourth finger-hole is larger than the fifth. After graduating from high school, Harlan took up an apprenticeship as a string instrument maker with Ernst Wilhelm Kunze and later founded his own workshop for the construction of medieval instruments in the musical instrument region of Markneukirchen, Vogtlandkreis, Germany. In the 1920s, Harlan was introduced to recorders by Wilibald Gurlitt at Freiburg im Breisgau. Harlan stated later that he had built his first recorder in 1921. In 1925, he visited the German music researcher Max Seiffert and the leading expert for old chamber music Arnold Dolmetsch in England. In 1926, he had a recorder built by other wind instrument makers. The result of these attempts was the still familiar German fingering recorder, which became an easy and fast-to-learn instrument. Both well-known songs as well as classical repertoire could be played. This \\"B√§renreiter-Blockf√∂te\\" from the \\"Harlan workshops\\" spread rapidly due to its low price of just four Reichsmark. Inspired by Gurlitt, Harlan developed not only recorders but also fiddles, viols and clavichords based on historical models. His most significant work was the development of the construction of the Fidel. His special concern was to make this six-stringed string instrument, which he constructed from a viola da gamba's basic frame, into a layman's instrument for the future. The Fidel and the recorder gained popularity among those new to playing music because of their easy-to-learn style of playing. In 1930, he founded the Harlan Trio with musicologist and violist and composer . The Trio were pioneers in the field of historical performance, playing music from the Middle Ages to the Baroque. In The Second World War, he served as a Luftwaffe Officer. in December 1944, he was in command of in the Lippe district. In the last days of the war in 1945, he refused the order to destroy the castle by means of a few barrels of gasoline and waited for the invasion of the Allied troops in Lemgo, so that the castle fell into their hands without a fight. In 1947, Harlan leased Sternberg Castle, resumed building instruments there and built the castle into an important training centre for German music. For this purpose, a varied learning and presentation program has been established, which consisted of courses in playing the Fidel, courses for the DIY of musical instruments, but also small concerts, puppetry and castle tours. Until his death, he assisted countless children to take their first steps in the field of music by playing, building their own or buying simple musical instruments. After Harlan's death, his sons Till and Klaus Harlan continued their father's work at Sternberg Castle.

Women interviewed by Janelle Asselin were comic book writers, artists, letterers, colorists, cartoonists, and many more careers in the industry. = Teen Titans #1 cover review = In 2014 Asselin published an editorial piece on comic book and pop culture website CBR, criticizing the cover artwork of the first issue of DC's The New 52 Teen Titans relaunch, specifically highlighting the artwork for Wonder Girl. Asselin criticized the work for what she saw as an unrealistic portrayal of a teenage female body and that Wonder Girl's was drawn inappropriately and disproportionally. After the piece was published, Asselin received multiple threats of rape and other bodily harm as well as derogatory sexual remarks questioning her professionalism and experience in the comic book industry. In response to these threats as well as content that site founder Jonah Weiland described as \\"a negativity and nastiness that has existed on the CBR forums for too long\\", the site's forums were closed in favor of a new forum that he hoped would be \\"inclusive, diverse, accepting and compassionate\\". =Rosy Press and Fresh Romance= Asselin launched Rosy Press with the hope that she would be able to revive the genre of romance comics. The company and its flagship anthology series, Fresh Romance, was funded via a successful Kickstarter campaign. Asselin recruited several of her colleagues to work on the series, including Kate Leth, Arielle Jovellanos, and Sarah Winifred Searle. The first volume of Fresh Romance was released in May 2015 as digital content and was followed up with a print release by Oni Press in 2016. Prior to her announcement in 2016 that she was shuttering Rosy Press due to personal health issues and financial reasons, the Fresh Romance anthology series received nominations for a Dwayne McDuffie Diversity Award and a Harvey Award for Best Anthology. In November 2016 the Fresh Romance series was picked up by Emet Comics, which also purchased Rosy Press.

Tucker's father worked as a mason. She left school at the age of 13, a year after her mother's death, in order to assist with the housework. At the age of 18, Tucker found work in Hamilton as an assistant at a school run by Jairus Swan. In 1892, she began attending the Collegiate Institute, a teachers' college run by the African Methodist Episcopal Church. She subsequently served as principal of the Edmonson School in Warwick from 1896 to 1901, and then in 1902 took over the Paget Glebe School in Hamilton. She never married, but she and her sisters raised two children that had been orphaned by one of their cousins.Adele Evelina Johnson Tucker, Bermuda Bios. Retrieved 30 November 2017.

Early life Roger Rosal was the third of six children born to Pablo Rosal and Crispina Crusat, both of whom were sugar plantation workers. His brother and sisters were Nicetas, Bernardo, Felicidad, Emilia and Remedios. He was an honors student in Ibaan Elementary School and St. James Academy in high school, and did odd jobs, sold mosquito nets and worked as a jueteng collector for his livelihood. He began attending college at Golden Gate Colleges in Batangas City in 1971 at the age of 24 but dropped out in his second year and had become a member of the Communist Party of the Philippines before Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972. He was also a trade union organizer and student activist, being a member of Kabataang Makabayan. In 1973, he was captured by government security forces and incarcerated at Camp Vicente Lim in Laguna, but managed to escape five months later. Rosal joined the New People's Army shortly thereafter. Career in the Left Rosal was assigned the task of establishing NPA forces in the Southern Tagalog and Bicol provinces during the 1970s and the 1980s. Rosal became the Communist Party of the Philippines' national spokesperson in 1994, bringing the CPP's statements into Filipino households via television and radio interviews. He welcomed visiting journalists into the NPA's encampments, often arranging these himself. He was implicated by former CPP Central Committee chairman Rodolfo Salas as one of the leaders of a deadly purge of suspected spies within the rebel movement in Southern Tagalog in 1988 called \\"Operation Missing Link\\". However, the CPP issued a statement in 2003 clearing him of major culpability. Some sources state that he was \\"severely criticized and disciplined\\" for failing to stop the purge; however his punishment was \\"unspecified\\". Death Rosal had suffered strokes at least three times; the first was in 1997, the second in 2000 and the last in 2006. He recovered from the first two episodes and returned to his duties in the communist movement. His third attack was more serious; it led to a gradual deterioration of his health until he could no longer discharge his duties. For the last five years of his life, he was cared for by cadre who provided for his security and medical requirements. He died on 22 June 2011 in an undisclosed location in Luzon from the effects of a heart attack. The CPP issued a statement announcing his death four months later. Rosal's cremated remains and that of his wife were re-buried in Ibaan, his hometown in Batangas in 2016, five years after his death. Personal life Roger Rosal was married to Rosario; her maiden name is either Lodronio, or Dumanais; they have two daughters, one of which ‚Äì Andrea, is the alleged secretary of the NPA sub-regional military area in the Southern Tagalog region. Rosario Lodronio was also a member of the communist revolutionary movement who died in a firefight in 2011; the NPA's Rosario Lodronio Rosal Command operating in Infanta, Quezon is named in her honor. Rosal was said to have liked playing softball and that he was religious. He also enjoyed playing musical instruments such as the guitar and harmonica, and singing as well.

It is not naturally found in organisms. Properties Perhaps due to its low bond energy with carbon (200 kJ/mol compared to 234 kJ/mol for selenium, or 272 kJ/mol for sulfur), tellurocysteine is not present in any known natural organisms and is hence relatively understudied in comparison to selenocysteine. Despite so, certain organisms such as fungi Aspergillus fumigatus is capable of incorporating tellurocysteine and telluromethionine into amino acids and proteins when exposed to a sulfur-free environment. It has been observed that when incorporated into glutathione transferase, tellurocysteine efficiently inhibited aminoacylation and increased the efficiency of glutathione peroxidase. Synthesis L-Tellurocysteine has been prepared from elemental tellurium by first reacting it with methyl (2R)-2-[(tert- butoxycarbonyl)amino]-3-iodopropionate in a tetrahydrofuran solvent with presence of lithium triethylborohydride, yielding a red oil which is acidified and treated with alkali before a treatment with citric acid to set its pH to 4.0, resulting in an orange solid after filtering and drying.

This architecture influenced her desire to have a house with similar properties, which she carried out in her Octagon, located in the caves of Punta Ballena, where she moved the workshop she had in Carrasco. It is a mud construction, with a roof of and a glass dome. It measures 100 m3, 3 m high walls, completely handmade with the collaboration of friends, artists, sculptors, painters and potters.

There are many murals in the Uruguayan and Argentine schools, such as the one made in School No. 3 of San Gregorio de Polanco and the one painted in the resort of Las Grutas, Argentina, together with that of her father. In 1983 she worked on several murals in the city of Maldonado, in 1991 she donated five murals for the children of the Red Cross of Montevideo. In 1994 she made 140 m2 of murals at the Sanguinetti school and different child aid centers. =Other techniques= P√°ez has also made several watercolors with Professor Dante Piccarelli.

She also designed the sculpture that is located in the Rambla de Atl√°ntida, in December 2014, as a tribute to her father, named Un sol para Atl√°ntida. The original idea was that of P√°ez Vilar√≥ himself, who proposed incorporating his landscaping into the Rambla de Atl√°ntida, and after his death, the Canary Islands decided to pay homage to him with a public space in his memory and an evocative sculpture. The sculpture was made with the financial support of the company Gerdau Laisa SA. It consists of iron reinforcement for the foundations and bases, and weighs 20 tons. The Ministry of Tourism and Sports allocated money for the paving, lighting, and urban equipment of the public space. The Municipality of Canelones carried out the project and execution of the public space that houses the sol. She has been a jury member of plastic arts competitions such as those organized by COFAC.

Often, a piece of music will have more than one owner. This is caused by Publishing contracts, co-writing, band contracts, label deals, and similar music contracts. Music ownership databases are created from the idea that with more transparency about the owners of musical compositions, the lower the costs become to create and use music. For example, a derivative license is needed when a portion of a piece of music is used in a different piece, which is a common practice in hip hop music, among other genres. In American copyright laws, a derivative work must have permission from every owner of the original work. If it is not known who the original owner of the work was and artists use it anyway, then they can be sued for copyright infringement. A music ownership database, major industry players speculate, would eliminate this problem. This is apparent through the amount of time and money spent in attempting to create this database.  Earlier attempts  =International Music Joint Venture= The International Music Joint Venture (IMJV) started in 1998. It was the first joint partnership to create a database between multiple different collective management organizations (CMOs). BUMA/STEMRA (Netherland), PRS (UK) and ASCAP (USA) were the founders. The database was supposed to be created using the metadata stored on Utrecht and London computers. IMJV invited many CMOs like SGAE (Spain), BMI (USA) and Harry Fox Agency, but for one reason or another many organizations did not join. Problems started to rise because IMJV was a way for STEMRA to move around employees they could not fire because of the laws in Holland at the time. When IMJV invited GEMA (Germany), they refused because they would have to fire their staff because the deal required STEMRA staff to take their place. Smaller CMOs started to believe that they would become redundant if IMJV launched. The larger CMOs who had already joined became reluctant to reduce their status and profitability by releasing the information for their repertoire. In late 2001, the initiative dissolved without a single operating office. At its peak, IMJV represented 21% of the world‚Äôs music. =International Music Registry= In 2011, the International Music Registry (IMR) launched. This was a database headed by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). IMR was a database not only for composition but also for recordings. Google agreed to fund WIPO early on, but WIPO broke their partnership after they thought the alliance would give Google too much power. Instead, WIPO tried to fund the project themselves. In- fighting among the different powerhouses like record labels and publishing houses caused the IMR to collapse. =Global Repertoire Database= The Global Repertoire Database was started by the PRS on September 2008. This database had representatives from publishing houses, record labels, Google, iTunes, Monifone, and had a total of 13 CMO‚Äôs: APRA (Australasia), ASCAP, BMI, BUMA, GEMA, PRS, STIM (Sweden), SACEM (France), SOCAN (Canada), SABAM (Belgium), SGAE, SIAE (Italy) and UBC (Brazil). More than 80 organizations participated in the initiative. This database was never meant to be for public use, but as a Global Database for music industry major players. Due to some CMOs pulling their support from the initiative, GRD went from having guaranteed financial support to having 8 million euros of investment scrapped.  Current American attempts  =Transparency of Music License Ownership Act= The Transparency of Music License Ownership Act bill was introduced to the United States House of Representatives on July 20, 2017 by Jim Sensenbrenner and Suzan DelBene. It creates a database with the ability to enforce participation by law. Like most legislation today, there are people who support this bill and people who oppose against this bill. The people who are in support after the Transparency of Music License Ownership Act say that it will help the music industry grow by cutting costs caused by misinformation and intermediaries. The opposition against this bill believes that the legislation would limit the ability for copyright owners to sue for infringement. =ASCAP and BMI Database= On July 26, 2017, ASCAP and BMI announced a joint database between both organizations, a project that has been in the works for the past year. The first phase, a searchable database, will roll out the first quarter of 2018. 90% of music in the USA is represented by these two organizations. Groups of people in that industry are excited for this much information to be on one database. At the same time, many have mentioned that the database is incomplete because it does not include music from the CMO SESAC (USA). House Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, among others in the industry, have suggested ASCAP and BMI cannot be trusted because of their past withdrawing from the GRD causing it to collapse. =RIAA and NMPA Database= Soon after ASCAP and BMI announced their database, RIAA and NMPA came forward with the information that they have also been working on the database between their two organizations. RIAA and NMPA said they purposely excluded ASCAP and BMI because they believed inviting them would cause a hindrance to the overall goal. At the same time, publishers in the music industry have expressed doubt about the ability of RIAA and NMPA to create a database without any CMOs.  Current Tech Solutions  = Blokur = Blokur, founded in 2017, has created a music copyright database to help music publishers get paid accurately through better rights data and music users to identify and clear rights. According to Blokur 70% of the music publishing sector uses Blokur to manage their rights and to benefit from automatic conflict reconciliation.

She was reported missing by her adoptive father Wesley Mathews on October 7, 2017. Her body was found under a road in a culvert near her home and her adoptive father admitted to disposing of the body.  Early life  Sherin Mathews was born as Saraswati Kumari in Nalanda, Bihar, India. Soon after her birth, her biological parents abandoned her. Sherin was found by a charity worker and taken to Nalanda Mother Teresa Anaath Seva Ashram, an adoption center run by Babita Kumari. Kumari recalled that Sherin used to call her Mumma. Wesley Mathews and his wife Sini Mathews, residents of Richardson, Texas, adopted Sherin on July 18, 2016. Sherin lived with her adopted parents in Richardson, Texas until she was reported missing in October 2017. Sherin's death has led to the Indian government revising its adoption process to prevent similar incidents in the future.  Disappearance  The Richardson Police were notified about Sherin's disappearance on October 7, 2017 at around 8 a.m. Wesley Mathews told police that Sherin was very undernourished when adopted from India and that, in order for her to gain weight, she should eat and drink whenever she was up. Wesley Mathews' initial report indicated that one of these feedings was attempted that morning at 3 a.m. However, Sherin did not want to drink her milk, and as punishment, he made her stand outside in a nearby alley. When Mathews went back outside to check on Sherin 15 minutes later, she was missing. Rather than reporting the disappearance immediately, Wesley Mathews said he did a load of laundry while figuring out what to do. Investigation Questions were raised as to why Sherin's parents had waited five hours to report her disappearance. On October 7, Wesley Mathews was arrested for child endangerment, for which he was later released on bail. Investigators began to further doubt his version of events after discovering that the family SUV had departed the Mathews household at approximately 4 a.m. the morning Sherin went missing. The SUV returned to the home before 5 a.m. on October 7, about three hours before Sherin's disappearance was reported to law enforcement. Discovery of body On October 22, 2017, the body of a small girl, later positively identified as Sherin Mathews, was found in a culvert near the Mathews' home. The same day, Wesley Mathews reported to the police station and changed his statement. According to the new testimony, when Sherin refused to drink the milk, he \\"physically assisted\\" her in drinking it; Sherin began to choke and subsequently died. He then disposed of Sherin's body in the culvert. According to Sherin's pediatrician, Dr. Suzanne Dakil, Sherin had injuries in various stages of healing and multiple broken bones. In response to this finding, which she identified as signs of abuse, Dr. Dakil alerted Child Protective Services. Sherin had also been hospitalized multiple times for skin and joint infections. One of Sini Mathews' explanations for the broken bones was that Sherin's older sister pushed her off a couch; upon another hospitalization, Sini Mathews stated that Sherin fell off some playground equipment. Sini Mathews told Dr. Dakil that Sherin had brittle bones as a result of the poor diet she'd had in India. However, the doctor determined that the injuries had occurred after Sherin left India. On January 3, 2018, Sherin's cause of death was reported as \\"homicidal violence\\" by the Dallas County Medical Examiner's office.  Arrests  Wesley Mathews was initially arrested for child endangerment and was released on bail. After the child's body was discovered and Wesley changed his statement, he was re- arrested on a charge of felony injury to a child. Wesley remains in jail on a bond of $1 million. On August 1, 2018, his bail was dropped to $500 thousand. On November 16, 2017, Sini Mathews turned herself in to the police, and was jailed on a bond of $250,000. She was charged with child abandonment after police alleged she left Sherin home alone on the night of October 6. Wesley Mathews was sentenced to life in prison. Charges were later dropped against Sini on March 1, 2019, though a detailed explanation was not given; this action was criticized by the Richardson Police Department. Wesley Mathews motioned for a new trial following his sentencing, claiming the photographs of the child's dead body, or the photos showing her injuries before her death, should never have been shown. On September 5, 2019, he was denied a new trial.https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Wesley-Mathews-Serving-Life-for-Death- of-Daughter-Seeks-New-Trial-559451201.html See also *List of people who disappeared.

Mackay was born in Colombo, Ceylon, to Emma (n√©e Foord) and Robert Mackay. Her father was a merchant, and the family lived for periods in New Zealand and New South Wales before eventually settling in Melbourne. After leaving school, Mackay found work as a typist and stenographer for the Motor Registration Branch. She later joined the Victoria Police in the same capacity, working in the office of the commissioner of police. In 1930, Mackay joined the police force itself, as one of eight women officers at the time. She was initially assigned to the plainclothes branch, but later joined the Criminal Investigation Bureau. She was promoted to senior constable in 1943, and made officer-in-charge of the women's section operating out of Russell Street; by that time the number of policewomen had grown to 15. Mackay was mainly assigned to cases involving women, but received several commendations for her work. She passed the required examinations for promotion to sergeant in 1953, but was not promoted as her superiors were unwilling to give her authority over male colleagues (unlike in other states, where there were a number of women in leadership positions). She appealed that decision to the Police Classification Board, which dismissed her complaint; the case received extensive media coverage. However, following a reorganisation in 1956 a separate seniority list for women was created, and Mackay was promoted to sergeant. She served as Officer-in-Charge of the new Women Police Branch from its creation until her retirement in 1961. Mackay, Katherine Ada (1901‚Äì1975), Australian Dictionary of Biography, 2000.

Description and history Bridge No. 63-016-150 is located in rural western Turner County, carrying 283rd Street over an unnamed stream, between 441st and 442nd Avenues. It is a two-arch stone structure, with a total length of about . Its two arches are segmental, with a span of , and rise about above the stream bed. The bridge has stone wing walls, and a cutwater on the south side of the central pier. The bridge is fashioned out of locally quarried quartzite fieldstone, most of which is roughly cut and randomly laid. The finished surfaces have been trimmed and squared. This bridge is one of 180 stone arch bridges built in Turner County as part of a New Deal-era federal jobs program, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). The county administration was able to build stone bridges at a lower cost than then- conventional steel beam bridges because of the availability of experienced stone workers, and the federal subsidy to the wages they were paid. The county was responsible for supervising the work crews and providing the building materials. This bridge was built in 1935 by a county crew to a standardized state design. It is one of only two bridges in the county built with FERA funding; others were built with later Works Progress Administration funds.

Gameplay   Reception  According to Metacritic, De Mambo received an average score of 69/100 based on 9 critics indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Writing for Nintendo Life, Ryan Craddock gave the game an 8/10, praising the stage variety which he noted brought a \\"wonderful freshness\\" to the game as he began to unlock more. Craddock also had positive things to say about how the game was \\"put together\\" noting how well the music and artstyle worked and lauded the menus and dialogue which he found to be \\"oozing with comedy\\". More negative comments were directed at the game's single player mode, which Craddock felt was lacking compared to its \\"hugely-loved\\" multi-player mode. A more negative review came from NintendoWorldReport's Casey Gibson, who, while complimenting the controls as \\"easy to grasp\\", found character movement in solo mode to be \\"frustrating\\". Praise was directed at the number of stages, with Gibson singling out the ones with hazards as being the \\"most fun\\" but Gibson ultimately felt that while there were \\"a ton\\" of stages the player would \\"burn out\\" before unlocking them all and that the action felt too \\"spread out\\" and surmised that the addition of some \\"outside factors\\" such as items would've been a welcome addition. Addressing the presentation of the game, Gibson noted that the found the visuals \\"appealing\\" and felt that the team did a \\"good job\\" with the music but found the \\"loud squeals\\" of the enemies in single player mode to be \\"annoying\\". Ultimately, Gibson found De Mambo to be a game with some \\"clever ideas\\", but felt that it was held back by its \\"limited features\\" lack of online play and \\"bland levels\\" and \\"not enough of a hook\\" to keep him \\"coming back for more\\".

It rises in the district of Harborne (formerly in Worcestershire), giving its name to the area known as Chad Valley (and thus indirectly to Chad Valley toys), and runs through the suburb of Edgbaston. Its course follows a roughly south-easterly direction, passing through the grounds of Lordswood Boys' School and then Harborne Nature Reserve and the Grade II listed Westbourne Road Town Gardens, underneath the former Harborne Railway (now a walkway), crosses the campus of the University of Birmingham and the grounds of Edgbaston Hall where it feeds Edgbaston Pool, and is in a culvert under the site of the BBC's former Pebble Mill Studios, leading to its confluence with the Bourne Brook. From there, water flows into the Rivers Rea, Tame and Trent, then the Humber, and eventually the North Sea. At one time, The Chad formed the boundary between the counties of Worcestershire and Staffordshire. A water mill, called 'Over Mill' operated on the brook from the 16th to 19th centuries. The remains of some of its buildings are extant.  Etymology  The origins of the name are not recorded.

Early career Yakov Davidovich Drabkin was born on January 1, 1874, in Sapozhok, Ryazan Governorate, in the Russian Empire. He became involved in the revolutionary movement as a schoolboy in Rostov-on-Don, where his family moved in 1887. In 1896, as a student at the St Petersburg Institute of Technology, using the alias S.I.Gusev, he joined the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, whose leading figure was Vladimir Lenin. In 1899, the police expelled him from St Petersburg, and ordered him to return to Rostov. Working full-time as a revolutionary organiser, he recreated the Rostov branch of the RSDLP, which had been destroyed after a wave of arersted in 1899, organised a political demonstration in February 1902, to mark the anniversary of the abolition of Serfdom in Russia, and pulled together scattered groups of student revolutionaries, who met in August 1902 to form the 'South Russian Student Group'. In July, Gusev was a delegate to the Second Congress of the RSDLP in Brussels, where he entertained fellow delegates by singing arias from operas in a \\"magnificent baritone\\". The Belgian ordered him out of the country, but he rejoined the Congress after it shifted o London. When the party split into its Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, he joined the Bolsheviks. In 1904, Gusev was secretary of the St Petersburg Bolshevik committee. In 1905, he was secretary of the Odessa Bolshevik committee. In 1906, he represented the Moscow Bolsheviks at the RSDLP Congress in Stockholm. Returning to Moscow, he was arrested and deported to Siberia for three years. Returning to St Petersburg in 1909, he fled to Terijoki when he feared that he was about to be arrested, and had a nervous breakdown, after which he withdrew from party activity for eight years. Soviet official Gusev rejoined the Bolsheviks in 1917, after the February Revolution, and was one of the founders of the Red Army. Early in 1919, he was a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee directing operations on the Eastern Front during the Russian Civil War. In July 1919, after the Red Army had had a spectacular success in driving the White army across the Urals into Siberia, Gusev was appointed to the six- member Military Revolutionary Committee, chaired by Leon Trotsky, who mistrusted Gusev, and later described him as a \\"genuine agent\\" of Josif Stalin, Trotsky's rival. Gusev was, with Mikhail Frunze, the leading theorist of the so-called 'Military Opposition', of which Stalin's crony Kliment Voroshilov was a supporter, who claimed that there was a specifically proletarian way of training an army and waging war, which Trotsky disputed. In 1921, despite Trotsky's opposition, Gusev was appointed head of the political administration (PUR) of the Red Army, but was removed in 1922 and replaced by one of Trotsky's supporters, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko. Gusev was a candidate member of the Central Committee in 1920‚Äì24. In 1923, he was appointed Secretary of the Central Control Commission (CCC) In January 1924, after the sacking of Antonov-Ovseyenko, Gusev was appointed head of a special commission incvestigating the Red Army. He backed Stalin in the disputes that split the communist party after the death of Lenin. In December 1924, he published an article in Pravda that was one of the first attacks on Trotsky's record as the head of the Red Army during the civil war. In 1925, he was appointed head of the press bureau of the Central Committee. Addressing the 14th Congress of the CPSU in December 1925, he said that every party member had a duty to report anyone to the CCC anyone who was involved in organised opposition to Stalin's leadership. USA visit Max Bedacht, co-founder of the CPUSA, answered questions about Gusev during a 1939 Dies Committee hearing In June 1925 he was sent the United States as a representative of the Comintern to the Workers Party of America.Draper, Theodore, 1912-2006. American communism and Soviet Russia : the formative period New York, Viking Press, 1960. pp.140-1 He stayed in the US, using the pseudonym, P. Green, until the end of the year. His main task was to mediate a dispute between rival factions led, respectively, by William Z. Foster and Charles Ruthenberg. Foster's group dominated the Fourth Congress of Workers Party, in Chicago in August 1925, and proposed to remove Ruthenberg from his post as party secretary, until Gusev hit them with an instruction from Moscow declaring that the Ruthenberg was 'more loyal' to the Comintern line. On October 16, 1939, J.B. Matthews, chief investigator for the Dies Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, inquired into activities of Gusev (transliterated as \\"Gussev\\" in the transcript) in the U.S. during the 1920s with Max Bedacht, a co-founder of the Communist Party of the USA and long-time general secretary of the International Workers Order (IWO): > Mr. Matthews: Do you know a man by the name Gussev? > Mr. Bedacht: Gussev‚ÄìI met Gussev in the Communist International. > Mr. Matthews: Did you ever meet him in the United States? > Mr. Bedacht: I did not. > Mr. Matthews. You never met Gussev in the United States? > Mr. Bedacht: No. > Mr. Matthews: Did Gussev ever write for The Communist during your > editorship? > Mr. Bedacht. That may be so. I know I solicited articles when I was in > Moscow; I tried to solicit articles for the Communist from people I met. > Mr. Matthews: Did you know Gussev as a Comintern representative in the > United States? > Mr. Bedacht: I don't know him as such. > Mr. Matthews: Did you ever know him by the name of \\"Green\\" or some other > alias? > Mr. Bedacht: No.  Comintern  Gusev's involvement in Comintern affairs began in March 1925, when, as representative of the CCC, he led the condemnation of Trotsky's ally Karl Radek, and Radek's German allies, Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer, who were banned from participation in the affairs of Comintern. In 1928, he was appointed head of the Central European secretariat of Comintern. Late that year, he put pressure on communist trade union leaders in Germany to break from the old labour federation, Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, which was dominated by social democrats, and form a separate federation.  Personality  Trotsky wrote: \\"Among the party workers ...was a man named Gusev. He called himself an 'Old Bolshevik'...His special vocation is that of falsifying the history of the civil war, for which his main qualification is his apathetic cynicism.\\" The French communist, Victor Serge, watched Gusev addressing a party meeting as the communist party was splitting in the late 1920s: Nadezhda Mandelstam, who met Gusev in 1930, said that she and her husband Osip Mandelstam joked afterwards about his 'Stony face' - \\"Only Soviet officials could make their faces turn to stone like this.\\" Personal life and death Gusev's wife Feodosia, was a party member from 1902, who played an active part in the 1905 revolution, and worked for the Foreign Literature publishing house after the revolution. Their daughter, Elizaveta Drabkina (1901-1974), was born in Brussels, where she lived to the age of five. At the age of 16, she was secretary to Yakov Sverdlov, one of the most powerful men in Soviet Russia. In 1926, in contrast to her father, she joined the Trotskyite opposition, and was expelled from the CPSU in 1928. She recanted in 1929, and was readmitted to the party, but was expelled again in August 1936, arrested in December, and sentenced to five years in the Gulag. After her release, she worked as an economist, but was rearrested in 1949. Rehabilitated in the mid-1950s, she published several novels based on her life. Gusev died on June 10, 1933, in Moscow.

As of August 2020, it is considered to be one of the hardest routes ever climbed, and one of only two routes in the world to have a proposed rating of . It was bolted in 2012 or 2013 by Adam Ondra, who first ascended it on September 3, 2017. Ondra described it as \\"much harder than anything else\\" he had previously done, and cautiously suggested the 9c rating. The route was originally named Project Hard by Ondra because it appeared harder than any other route previously climbed. A few days after completion, Ondra renamed it Silence, stating that when climbing, he felt a sense of inner quiet, and also that on completion he felt unable to scream in exhilaration, which was his more usual reaction on completing a climb.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/04/czech- climber-sets-new-benchmark-with-ascent-of-worlds-hardest- cliffhttps://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/adam-ondra-worlds-hardest-climb- norway/index.htmlhttps://gripped.com/news/adam-ondra-calls-worlds-hardest- route-silence/ Climbing Silence took Ondra more than 4 years of practice and training visits,https://www.climbing.com/news/interview-adam-ondra-on-what-it- took-to-climb-the-worlds-first-5-15d and long-term dedicated preparation, including extensive mental and physical training for the specific difficulties posed by the route.https://www.climbing.com/skills/interview-how-adam-ondra- used-next-gen-visualization-to-send-silence-5-15dHanshelleren Cave, in Flatanger, is known worldwide for the climbing routes Change (9b+) and Silence (9c), climbed by Adam Ondra in 2012 and 2017, respectively. Route description Silence is about 45 m long, curving up the cave wall and along part of the underside of its roof. The first 20 m are about along the beginning of the established routes Nordic Flower and Change, before branching off into a 5 move . It then transitions into a hard sequence of three distinct boulder problems (also called \\"cruxes\\" by Ondra): an extremely hard , a \\"burly 4-move\\" and a with slippery feet. The first one was described by Ondra as the hardest he ever climbed. It consists of 10 incredibly hard and unusual moves, including single-finger locks, climbing upside down and a variation of a figure four move ending with an extremely bad kneebar rest. After the third boulder, a huge jug leads to the anchor, through a relatively easy boulder consisting of five moves. In a 2017 interview, Ondra was asked about specific difficulties in climbing Silence. He stated that: : \\"The strangest moves are on the V15 crux 1, which is very physical, but the most precision-demanding climbing I have ever seen in my life. It is very hard to turn upside down, ‚Äústab‚Äù my left foot super high into the crack, doing it 100-percent precisely, finish the sequence with this foot jam, doing the last move while doing the most extreme drop-knee I have ever done, which feel like it would tear my knee and back apart.\\" First ascent Working the route required Ondra to take seven trips to Flatanger, four in 2016 and three in 2017. Just linking the 10 moves in the first boulder problem required four weeks of trials. After completing the first boulder problem he practiced linking it through to the chains, then practiced starting the climb from progressively lower. He linked the whole thing together on his second attempt from the ground. Ondra trained specifically for the route. For instance, he completed multiple hard bouldering moves with very short rests between them, and visualised the most difficult moves while doing specific exercises with his physiotherapist. He also trained his calf muscles to be able to hold as long as necessary on the extremely bad kneebar rests which he used during the ascent. On completion, Ondra commented: : \\"At the end of the route when I knew I did it, I had one of the strangest emotions ever.\\" : \\"I clipped the anchor and I could not even scream. All I could do was just hang in the rope, feeling tears in my eyes. It was too much joy, relief and excitement all mixed together.\\"  Gallery  Image:Adam Ondra climbing Silence 9c by PAVEL BLAZEK 2.jpgAdam Ondra toe- hooking at the beginning of the first crux, in July 2017.

It is located adjacent to the Church and Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Igreja e Convento de Nossa Senhora do Carmo). The Church of the Third Order of Mount Carmel was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938 and is part of the Historic Center of Salvador UNESCO World Heritage Site. History The Third Order of Mount Carmel was founded in Portugal in 1629, following the establishment of the Carmelites in Portugal in 1251. The Third Order of Mount Carmel in Salvador was established in 1636 in Bahia by Pedro Alves Botelho, a wholesale trader; Pedro da Silva, the governor of Bahia and Count of S√£o Louren√ßo, was its first prior. Construction of the first church structure began in 1644 with permission from the Convent of Our Lady of Mount Carmel; the land was donated by residents of Salvador. The brotherhood was recognized by a papal bull on December 12, 1695 under the name of \\"Vener√°vel Ordem Terceira da M√£e Sant√≠ssima e Soberana Senhora do Monte do Carmo\\", or the Venerable Third Order of the Holy Mother and Sovereign Lady of Monte do Carmo. The master woodcarver Louren√ßo Rodrigues Lan√ßarote completed extensive work on the church between 1733 and 1734; he later carved the ornate side altars of the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, Salvador. The church was destroyed by fire on the night of March 21, 1788. The building was completely destroyed, but numerous images and other artwork were saved or salvaged from the building. The Order began reconstruction of the church in 1788, the same year of the fire, but was delayed by a lack of funds. Work began on the current structure in 1803; its facade in lioz from Portugal was completed in 1855. The interior of the church was richly decorated. It was completed later in the century. Structure View of nave and chancel Catacombs of the Third Order of Mount Carmel The Church of the Third Order of Mount Carmel sits at the top of Ladeira do Carmo, a street leading north from the main squares of the Pelourinho. It is in close proximity to the Church of the Blessed Sacrament at Rua do Passo. The structure, of brick and stone masonry, is slightly set back from street level and is approached via a large staircase in stone. The structure is built around two courtyards. Its plan is vast in scale and consists of the church and sacristy, an ossuary, a consistory room (casa da mesa), and a house of saints (casa dos santos). The galleries are glazed. =Exterior= The exterior of the church features a staircase, two towers with a frontispiece and pilasters, doorways of lioz stone. The style of the facade is eclectic; it has both Neoclassical elements of the period and Roccoco elements common to other churches in the Pelourinho. The facade is crowned by a cross and a relief of the coat of arms of the Carmelites. The decorative elements of the towers were considered old-fashioned at the time. =Interior= The floor plan of Church of the Third Order of Mount Carmel is typical of eighteenth-century Bahian religious architecture. It has a single nave, side altars, side aisles with tribunes, a chancel, and a sacristy. The sacristy provides access to the ossuary in the lower level. The interior of the church is in the Neoclassical style, common to both church architecture in Salvador and across Brazil in the 18th century. The nave has an organ imported from France. The principal work of the church is cedar carving of Christ inlaid with rubies; the rubies represent 2,000 drops of blood. It is the work of Francisco Xavier Chagas and dates to 1730. The ceiling of the nave features figurative paintings by Jos√© Te√≥filo de Jesus and were executed between 1815 and 1817. The statue of Our Lady of Mount Carmel on the altar is said to be a likeness of Isabel II, daughter of Garcia d'√Åvila.

Career Born in 1834 in Albemarle County, Virginia to a plantation owning family, Orianna Andrews (nee Moon) decided to study medicine from an early age. She attended the Troy Female Seminary (now the Emma Willard School) for a year which provided the required courses in sciences and mathematics to allow her to go onto the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania (now the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania). This was in the College's fourth induction of students, and Andrews was the first woman from Virginia to attend and only the third woman from the Southern United States. Her thesis was submitted in 1856, with graduation taking place the following year. At the time, she was one of 38 women who had received medical degrees in the United States. She spent two years travelling in the Middle East and Europe, before returning to North America in 1861 towards the start of the American Civil War. She wrote to the military commanders of Virginia, offering her skills to the war effort of the Confederate States of America. She was employed as the superintendent of a team of nurses in a makeshift hospital at the University of Virginia. She wrote to Brigadier General Philip St. George Cocke asking to be moved to the front, and her sister Lottie Moon wrote to him in support as well. She was not moved but instead left the service when she married Dr. John Summerfield Andrews in November 1861. They moved to Richmond, Virginia and worked in a Confederate Army hospital.

Near the end of his long reign, Emperor Wu made her young son Liu Fuling his heir apparent, but ordered the death of Lady Gouyi to prevent her from usurping power from the boy emperor. After Fuling acceded to the throne, he posthumously named her as empress dowager and built for her the Yunling mausoleum, which is now a Major Historical and Cultural Site of China. Life Lady Gouyi was a native of Hejian Commandery, born into the Zhao family. Her given name is unknown. Her father was castrated after committing an offence and served as a minor eunuch in Chang'an (now Xi'an), the capital of the Han empire. It was said that Lady Gouyi's fists were always clenched. When Emperor Wu of Han was having a hunting expedition in Hejian, Zhao was summoned to his presence. When the emperor touched her hands, her fists miraculously opened up, revealing a jade hook in one of them. Emperor Wu was pleased and took her as a consort, naming her Lady Quan (\\"fist\\") and Lady Gouyi (\\"hook\\"). Awarded the consort rank of (jieyu, meaning \\"handsome fairness\\"), she was also known as Zhao Jieyu. Zhao Jieyu lived in the Gouyi Palace, within the imperial Ganquan Palace outside of Chang'an. It was said that following a 14-month pregnancy‚Äîthe same length as the mythical Emperor Yao, she gave birth to a son, named Liu Fuling, in 94 BC. Emperor Wu was pleased with the child's connection with the sage emperor, and named a gate in the palace the \\"Gate of Yao's Mother\\". The favour shown to Lady Gouyi and her son led to speculations that Emperor Wu wanted to demote Crown Prince Liu Ju, the son of Empress Wei Zifu, and make Fuling the heir apparent. The court was thrown into chaos when there were accusations of witchcraft and necromancy (Â∑´Ë†±‰πãÁ¶ç) implicating Prince Ju and the empress. Hundreds of people were executed and Empress Wei and Prince Ju were both forced to commit suicide in 91 BC. Death After much hesitation, Emperor Wu made Fuling the heir apparent. Because Fuling was a child, the emperor feared that Lady Gouyi would seize power after his death, as Empress L√º had done after the death of Emperor Gao about a century earlier. Emperor Wu appointed the trusted official Huo Guang as the future regent, and summoned Lady Gouyi. He berated her for no apparent reason and ordered her imprisonment. When she kowtowed and looked at him in bewilderment, he said \\"Out, quickly! You cannot be saved!\\" She was taken to prison and died soon afterward in 88 BC. According to the Book of Han, she died of \\"anxiety\\", whereas Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian explicitly states that she was \\"ordered to die\\". Modern scholars generally agree that she was killed. After her death, Emperor Wu explained to his attendants that a child emperor with a young mother would lead to unrest, and the empress dowager would wield unchecked power as Empress L√º did, although he acknowledged that his action might be misunderstood by \\"children and fools\\". Mausoleum Emperor Wu died in 87 BC, and the young Prince Fuling acceded to the throne as Emperor Zhao of Han. He conferred the title empress dowager to his mother posthumously, and mobilized 20,000 troops to construct a mausoleum for Lady Gouyi, called the Yunling. He established the Yunling County and moved 3,000 households there to look after the tomb. The Yunling, located in modern Chunhua County, Shaanxi Province, was declared a Major National Historical and Cultural Site (designation 7-0667) in 2013. The mausoleum was robbed in July 2016. In November 2017, the Shaanxi Police arrested 91 suspected tomb robbers and smugglers and recovered more than 1,100 artifacts. Legends Over the centuries, many legends grew out of the death of Lady Gouyi. It was said that her body did not become cold in death and emitted a fragrance, and that when her coffin was later opened, there was nothing inside but a silk slipper. She became revered as a Taoist immortal. Another legend, recorded in the Yunyang ji, says that Emperor Wu built a rostrum in the Ganquan Palace to communicate with Lady Gouyi's spirit. A blue bird often perched on the rostrum, but disappeared after Emperor Xuan acceded to the throne in 73 BC.

During World War II she worked for the Ministry of Information in the Postal Censorship department. Blair also painted scenes of bomb damage in Belfast and portraits of some of the British and American troops stationed there. Furthermore, she submitted a proposal to the War Artists' Advisory Committee to record the activities of women who had entered the industrial workforce for the war effort. The WAAC Committee didn't act on that proposal but later in the conflict did purchase a number of watercolours from Blair depicting women officers. After the war, Blair had a solo exhibition of her work in 1948 at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery. Leaving Belfast she studied in New York under the architect Wallace Harrison and then in Paris with Fernand L√©ger and Andr√© Lhote. By 1975, Blair was living in Belgium and, working in a largely abstract style, she had a solo show in Brussels.

The Baptistery of San Giovanni is a Paleochristian baptistery attached to the Santa Restituta church in Naples, Italy. It is the oldest surviving baptistery from medieval Europe.  History  The baptistery was likely built in the fourth century. There are conflicting accounts of who commissioned the construction of the baptistery and when. Severus, the twelfth bishop of Naples, is often credited with its construction in the late fourth century. The construction of the baptistery by Severus is chronicled in John the Deacon‚Äôs Gesta episcoporum Neapolitanorum. However, the thirteenth-fourteenth century work Chronicle of Saint Mary of the Principle, credits Constantine the Great with the building of the baptistery at the same time as the S. Restituta during the early fourth century. The architecture and mosaic style lead researchers to believe that the baptistery was more likely to have been constructed in the later fourth century. The baptistery was remodeled under the nineteenth Bishop of Naples, Soter (465-486).  Description  The piscina, a shallow pool where baptisms were performed. The baptistery is approximately 7 √ó 7 meters. The interior is octagonal with a domed roof. The piscina, 2 meters across and 45 cm deep, is made of earthenware. The piscina was not deep enough for the baptized to be fully submerged. Instead of full immersion, the baptized stood in the piscina and the water was poured over their head three times. This is evidenced by baptism iconography located in the Roman Catacombs. The baptistery was once a freestanding building. The original entrance consisted of two openings in the western wall. This establishes the original orientation of the building as east to west, not the north to south that we see today. This is also supported by the orientation of the mosaics. Today, one enters the baptistery through a chapel behind the main apse in S. Restituta. Additionally, the baptistery can be entered through a porch on the northern side of the building. This porch connects the baptistery to the archiepiscopal palace. Samaritan Woman at the Well in the Baptistery of San Giovanni  Mosaics  = Dome = In the center of the dome roof is the Chi Rho symbol. The golden Chi Rho mosaic sits on a deep blue background and is surrounded by gold, blue, and white stars. The Chi Rho is flanked by the letters alpha and omega, in reference to Revelation 1:11. Above the Chi Rho is the hands of the Eternal Father (Dextera dei) clutching a jeweled laurel wreath wrapped in a golden ribbon. = Traditio Legis = Miraculous Draught of Fishes or the Walking on Water. In this scene, Jesus stands atop a blue orb and hands Saint Peter the scroll of law. Written on the scroll is Dominus Legem Dat, Latin for \\"the Lord gives the law\\". While the left side is badly damaged, it can be assumed that the figure to Jesus's left is Paul the Apostle based on early Christian iconography. = Biblical scenes = There are several mosaics of biblical scenes lining the walls beneath the dome. To the right of the Traditio Legis is a mosaic depicting the Miraculous Draught of Fishes or perhaps Jesus Walking on Water. The scene is incomplete but shows Peter in a boat and Jesus on the shore with his hand outstretched towards fish. This could be the Draught of Fishes, the Walking on Water scene, or a mixture of the two, but without the complete mosaic, this remains unclear. The Samaritan Woman at the Well scene is attached to the Marriage at Cana scene. While the second figure by the well is destroyed, it may be Jesus based on the Biblical story, an important baptism allegory. In this scene, Jesus offers the Samaritan Woman the water of eternal life. The Marriage at Cana depicts Jesus turning water into wine. Like the Samaritan Woman scene, this miracle displays the divine transformation of water.

Kanap√©, (born 1941 in Betsiamites [now Pessamit] in the C√¥te-Nord region of Quebec) is considered one of the great specialists in education among First Nations in Canada, distinguishing herself since the 1950s. She was the first Innu teacher in Quebec, the first Aboriginal person to serve on the Conseil sup√©rieur de l'√©ducation, and the first female Innu chief. Biography Marcelline Picard-Kanap√© is from the Innu community and First Nations reserve of Betsiamites (now Pessamit), near Rimouski, Quebec. She was the eldest of twelve children. She was schooled first by the Sisters of Charity and then studied at the √âcole Normale du Bon- Conseil in Chicoutimi. In 1959, at age 18, she obtained a diploma in preschool and elementary school education and became the first Innu teacher in Quebec. She earned a bachelor's degree in education from the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Chicoutimi (UQAC) in 1988. Picard-Kanap√© taught primary education in Pessamit for two decades and struggled with the curriculum and system that shamed and divided generations of her people. Her dedication to the community saw her elected as an advisor to the Betsiamites Band Council at age 21. She was principal of the Betsiamites Elementary and Secondary School from 1977 to 1984. When control of the school system passed from the Department of Indian Affairs to the Band Council in 1980, she was ready to effect changes including the introduction of Innu language courses. In the process, she helped standardize the Innu language and develop the first Innu‚ÄìFrench dictionary. Picard-Kanap√© was Director of Education at Pessamit then at Uashat-Maliotenam while sitting on the Conseil sup√©rieur de l'√âducation du Qu√©bec (1989‚Äì1992), the first aboriginal person to do so. She was then elected Chief of the Betsiamites Band Council, the first woman to hold such a position. During two successive terms in office (1992‚Äì1996) she saw women represented in the community's political bodies. Picard-Kanap√© has also worked to facilitate cooperation between native and non-native peoples, taking part in many conferences and forums and in the creation of books on the subject. She sat on the board of directors of the Montagnais Cultural and Edutational Institute and evaluated the teacher training program at UQAC. She co-founded the Khani- Khant Choir and Native Dance troupes. The Universit√© du Qu√©bec's National Institute of Scientific Research awarded Picard-Kanap√© an honorary doctorate in 2004.

Having started his career in typography, he became a leading web designer in the mid-nineties, then worked as a business consultant, and currently leads a nonprofit foundation and a start-up in London cryptocurrency. Siegel is also the author of four books exploring the intersection of management and technology. Education David Siegel received an undergraduate degree in mathematics from the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1985, he earned a master's degree in digital typography from Stanford University. Career Siegel's first job was with Pixar, whose mission at the time was to build and sell image computers. After one year, he left and started two companies in the next ten years. During this period he designed several retail typefaces. Among the first wave of designers to turn their attention to the web, Siegel began designing web sites in 1994, and in 1995 he started Studio Verso, a web design agency in San Francisco. He became noted for his web award site named High Five, where he wrote a column reviewing websites for their design excellence. On his personal site he also ran a how-to section called Web Wonk, which offered instruction in web design, including the basics of color, typography, layout, and images. Siegel's first book, Creating Killer Web Sites, was published in 1996 (revised second edition 1997) and became an international bestseller. Siegel's approach to 'Third-generation Site Design', as promoted on his sites and in his book, involved bending the structural properties of the HTML markup language for presentational ends. This approach consolidated a school of web design that favoured visually oriented aesthetics over ideals of usability as championed by Jakob Nielsen. In the absence of browser support for the still gestating Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) presentation language (which he influenced and encouraged), he recommended the use of invisible single-pixel GIFs as spacers for visual control, and table-based layouts. Siegel reconsidered these recommendations in 1997, denouncing the single-pixel GIF and table-based layouts as ‚Äòhacks‚Äô and expressing optimism that advances in CSS support were going to bridge the divide between structure and presentation. Having acquired a reputation as the \\"father of web design,\\" Siegel shifted his business activities from web design to web strategy consulting, focusing his second book, Secrets of Successful Web Sites on web project management. His third book, Futurize your Enterprise, appeared in 1999 and advises businesses to restructure their companies and websites around their internet-empowered customers. In 2010 Siegel's fourth book came out, Pull, which discusses the impact of the Semantic Web, defined in unusually broad terms, on business. In recent years, Siegel has been pursuing the project of an open-source platform named Pillar, which would enable users to retain control of their personal information using the blockchain. Having failed to raise venture capital for his company 2030, he resolved to raise the money from prospective users of the platform, offering 560 million tokens via an initial coin offering in 2017. The Pillar project raised over $21 million in Ether and currently operates in London. He is also the Founder of 2030.

In 1974 she studied acting at HB Studio and briefly acted in films, playing a Turkish princess in the film Fellini's Casanova, for which she learned belly dance. At New York University she studied under Dario Fo. She studied voice with Michael Warren and Walter Blazer. While back in Italy, she decided that film was not to be her career. Federico Fellini advised her: > Io ho notato che tu sei molto seria... sei un'artista. Tu non sei come > quelle che stanno qua. Sai che te dico: che tu devi torna' a New York. Non > resta' qua perch√© se io avessi potuto fare quello che faccio qua in America, > se sapessi meglio l'inglese, l'avrei fatto. > (I notice that you are very serious... you're an artist. You are not like > the other girls here... You know what I say? You've got to return to New > York. Don't stay here because if I had been able to do in America what I do > here, if I knew English better, I would have done it.) In 1980 she co-founded, with John La Barbera, the music, folk dance, and theater group I Giullari di Piazza ('the town square players'), which has performed in the United States and Europe, and is in residency at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. She studied traditional tambourine technique with the Sicilian percussionist Alfio Antico, renowned for his ability to create \\"magical and primordial\\" atmospheres. She has also worked with percussionist Glen Velez, the leading figure in the revival of frame drumming in America, whom she met in 1982 through her work in Bread and Puppet Theater. Velez gave her a book, La Terra del Rimorso (The Land of Remorse) by Ernesto De Martino, which inspired her to study Apulian tarantism. Beginning in 1984, Belloni has taken part in the feast of San Rocco of Torrepaduli in Salento, Apulia, a traditional summer event for tambourines and pizziche. Her former husband's name was Dario Bollini. Work The traditional dance she teaches is presented as an ancient healing ritual for women suffering from repressed sexuality, abuse, powerlessness, and the feeling of being caught in a web that binds them. Belloni emphasizes that tarantella music and dance, as popularly known today around the world, is different from its origins in Apulian folk culture, going back to the ancient Greeks. The \\"spider bite\\" or tarantismo, being psychosexual injury, formerly called hysteria, affects women with depression and loneliness, and can be healed by drumming and dancing the ancient pizzica tarantata. Belloni teaches that a woman suffering from such \\"bite\\" is called a tarantata, and the music and dance for healing it is called pizzica, referring to the spider's bite. By dancing oneself into ecstatic trance with the support of the community, a sufferer seeks to expel the \\"venom\\" and be restored to health. Belloni has integrated her work studying women's therapeutic dance and drumming with traditions of the Black Madonna in several countries, including the Madonna of Montevergine in Campania. Like many before her, she connects devotion to the Black Madonna with pre-Christian Goddess worship dating back to the ancient Greeks, who colonized Apulia as part of Magna Graecia long before the rise of Rome. Belloni has brought into her art influences from song and drumming of Brazil, invoking Yemanj√° and Oshun. For example, in \\"Canto di Sant'Irene\\" she sings \\"In Calabria √® Maria / Yemanj√° √® a Bahia\\" ('In Calabria she is Mary; she is Yemanj√° in Bahia'). In connection with Yemanj√°, Belloni plays the Remo ocean drum, which produces ocean wave-like sounds. In addition to revivifying traditional music, she has composed an oeuvre of original songs inspired by Black Madonnas and others on Brazilian themes, as well as love songs after the Italian tradition. She has also worked to integrate her music with African drumming, saying: \\"It appeals to me, because I do believe that this form of music therapy and this healing drumming originated in Southern Italy, but in the history most of it comes from Africa, because Africa is closer to us than Northern Europe. All of this connected in the ancient times, and it makes a lot of sense to do it now in America, because it really is like continuing the normal evolution of this music.\\" Belloni conducts dance therapy workshops, titled \\"Rhythm is the Cure,\\" in New York, Italy, and other places in the United States and Europe. Participants dress in white with red sashes. Since 2009, she has led a New York City troupe of women drummers named the Daughters of Cybele. Reproduced at AlessandraBelloni.com press/reviews Belloni's stage shows Rhythm Is the Cure and Tarantella Spider Dance are productions combining music, tammuriata dance and drumming, drama, fire dance, and aerial dance. Spider Dance starts with the birth of Spider Woman and traces the development of pizzica tarantata tradition from ancient Greek rituals of Cybele and Dionysus to Italian folk tradition. The Remo drum company produces a signature line of Alessandra Belloni tambourines depicting the Black Madonna of Montserrat.

It is notable for its complete set of 28 medieval stained-glass windows, one of the best-preserved in England. Part of the tower dates from the early 15th century. The church was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century by John Tame (c.1430‚Äì1500), a wealthy local wool merchant. It is a Grade I listed building in the Perpendicular style. Fairford Church, built by John Tame, consecrated in 1497. Viewed from south-east \\"Great West Window\\", Fairford Church, depicting the Last Judgement and related scenes. One of the 28 magnificent Fairford stained glass windows installed in his church by John Tame Interior Tame rebuilt the church purposely to install his stained glass, and thus the design is \\"necessarily somewhat cramped\\". The church was consecrated in 1497 by the Bishop of Worcester, within whose diocese lay most of Gloucestershire at that time. It consists of a chancel, nave, a tower between them, and two aisles, which extend without any external break to about half the length of the chancel. According to Neale \\"This arrangement, necessary to secure the required number of windows, somewhat injures the effect of the exterior, and makes the distinction between chancel and nave less marked than might have been wished\\". The entire length is 125 feet, and the breadth is 55 feet. The fittings of the church are of the most beautiful and costly character. The chancel is furnished with fourteen elaborate misereres, and a rood-screen, and lateral parcloses of exquisite design and in remarkable preservation. The whole floor is paved in chequers of blue and white marble; and the roof of every part is excellently carved wood, with good corbels both for the principal and secondary rafters.Neale, p.121 The north aisle is the manorial chapel of the Tames and of their successors as lords of the manor of Fairford.Neale, p.122 Exterior The tower is the principal feature on the exterior: its plan is square, the edges however being taken off and adorned with niches. There is a pierced embattled parapet, with four angular pinnacles. There are four heraldic shields on the greater string course, in bold relief. That on the western side is charged with the arms of Tame; that on the north bears: Quarterly, first and fourth, a bend; second and third, a fret (Despencer, Earl of Gloucester). On the south is Chequy, a chevron (Newburgh, arms borne by Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick and later quartered by Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick); and on the east Three chevronels for de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who all at some time owned the manor of Fairford. There is an elaborate south-western porch, with a parvise over it. This has been since thrown open to the church, and is furnished with a projecting gallery, which serves as a pew. Stained-glass windows The pre-Reformation medieval stained glass panes are of national historical and architectural importance as they constitute what is \\"probably the most complete set of medieval stained glass in Britain\\", consisting of 28 windows displaying biblical scenes. They were added after the church was rebuilt in the 1490s by John Tame, under the instructions of his son Edward Tame. The glass was made between 1500 and 1517 and the panes now attributed to the Flemish glazier Barnard Flower (d.1517), glazier to King Henry VII. According to some sources, John Thornton of Coventry and Galyon Hone were also associated with the Netherlandish Renaissance painted glass at this church. The glass survived the destruction that was common during the Reformation and the English Civil War in a more complete state than at any other parish church in England. During the Second World War, the stained glass windows were removed and stored in a cellar for safekeeping from 1939 to 1945. A conservation and restoration programme began in 1988 and finished in 2010.Clear glass now protects the old glass. Monument to John Tame Chest tomb, \\"Founder's Tomb\\", of John Tame (d.1500), St. Mary's Church, Fairford. Viewed from within the Tame Chapel 1846 drawing of ledger stone of John Tame Photograph of ledger stone of John Tame The monument to John Tame consists of a chest tomb on the north side of the chancel (the most usual burial-place for a founder), under the arch which opens into the north aisle or Tame Chapel. Over the chest tomb is an elaborately carved wooden parclose screen in the form of a Tudor arch, spanning the length of the monument, and supported by corbels in the form of angels bearing open books. The length of the Purbeck Marble slab on top is six feet nine inches; the breadth, three feet seven inches; and the height, three feet six inches. The north and south, the longer, sides have each three heraldic shields, in circular panels; on both, from east to west, the shields display the following arms: (1) Twynihoe, (2) Tame, (3) Tame impaling Twynihoe. The west displays the arms of Tame. On the ledger stone on top of the chest tomb are various monumental brasses, set into the slab, the main ones showing John Tame and his wife standing facing each other. Above John Tame are sculpted in relief into the marble the arms of Tame: Argent, a dragon vert, a lion azure crowned gules, combatant.Neale, p.132; given by Edmondson as Or, a dragon vert, a lion rampant azure crowned or, combatant, quoted in Neale, p.132 The shields were originally enamelled in colours, but few traces remain: the dragon, however, is clearly vert, and his tongue gules. Above the figure of his wife Alice Twynyho are sculpted the arms of Twynyho: Argent, a chevron between three lapwings sable. The two arms are impaled in the two similarly sculpted shields, one at the feet of each brass figure. It is remarkable that the wife should be represented with so old a face, since her death preceded her husband's by nearly thirty years. Her dress is peculiarly simple and elegant, with the exception of the wired head-dress, which is \\"of an early and unpleasing form\\".Neale, p.132 The ledger line is inscribed in Latin and English, unusually with lettering designed to be read from the outside instead of in the usual way, as follows: :Orate pro animabus Joh(an)is Tame Armigeri et Aliciae uxoris eius quidem Joh(an)es obiit octavo die mensis Maii anno D(o)m(ini) millensimo quingentensimo et anno regum regis Henrici Sept(im)i sextodecimo et predicta Alicia obiit vicesimo die mensis Decembris anno Domini mill(ens)imo CCCC septuagesimo primo quorum a(n)i(m)abus propicietur Deus.

She was educated in Alfred University (B.A. 1872, A.M. 1875); and the American School Household Economics (1909). In 1875, Kellogg visited the Battle Creek Sanitarium, became interested in the subjects of sanitation and hygiene, and a year later enrolled in the Sanitarium School of Hygiene. Later on, she joined the editorial staff of Good Health magazine, and in 1879, married Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Kellogg was prominently identified with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), in 1882 being appointed national superintendent of the Department of Hygiene. Three years later, she was appointed associate superintendent of the Social Purity department of the WCTU. Out of her experiences in the Social Purity work in the WCTU, grew a pamphlet, in 1890, entitled \\"Talks to Girls\\" which enjoyed an extended circulation. Other books written by Kellogg included Studies in Character Building (1905), and Science in the Kitchen (1892). Kellogg charter member of the Michigan Woman's Press Association.  Early life and education  Ella Ervilla Eaton was born in 1853, in Alfred, New York. She was of Puritan ancestry. Her father, Joseph Clarke Eaton, traced his direct descent from John Eaton, an English pioneer, who, with Abigail, his wife, came to the United States from England in 1635 and settled in Dedham, Massachusetts. Her mother was Hannah Sophia (Coon) Eaton. Kellogg attended the local schools before going to Alfred University, being continually in school, with the exception of one term of teaching, until her graduation at the age of 19, when she received the degree of A. L. (Laureate of Arts.). During her school life, she was an active member of the Alfredian Lyceum, one of the four literary societies of the university, taking many prominent places upon the programme of its public sessions. She was also for some time one of the editors of the Alfred Student, a college paper, and probably in the congenial atmosphere of these youthful experiences received her first inclination toward literary work. Being a quick and ready pupil, she was always in advance of those of her own age, and at her graduation was the youngest pupil who had ever won equal honors at that university. Career Ella Eaton Kellogg at work The year following graduation was spent in teaching at a community school in Harmony, New Jersey, and then post-graduate work in the study of languages, particularly Latin, German, as well as music and drawing, and at the university commencement of 1875 she was given another degree, that of A. M. The young woman was, up to this time, planning to devote herself to teaching as a profession, but a visit to the Battle Creek Sanitarium in the summer of 1877 seems to have given an unconscious viewpoint to all her subsequent life. After teaching in the school for three years, she left the school in order to help her aunt, who was ill, receiving help from the Battle Creek Sanitarium. During an epidemic of typhoid fever that occurred in the neighborhood during the early autumn, the number of patients being so great that trained nurses could not be obtained for them, she volunteered her services and carried safely through the disease several of the most critical cases. This experience led her to become interested in sanitary and hygienic subjects, and in the following year, she entered the Sanitarium School of Hygiene, in which she obtained a knowledge of anatomy, physiology, hygiene, and the practical care of the sick. The principal of the School of Hygiene, who was also the editor of Good Health, soon discovered her capabilities, and engaged her services as an editorial assistant. On February 22, 1879, she married John Harvey Kellogg, M.D., the president and superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. At the national convention of the WCTU in Detroit in 1882, Kellogg was elected national superintendent of the department of hygiene, a position involving, among other duties, that of preparing and publishing a syllabus of lessons, together with the holding, from time to time, of numerous \\"health institutes\\" in different portions of the country. In 1884, was instituted the Sanitarium Experimental Kitchen, a work demanding her constant personal supervision, undertaken in the interest of dietetic reform and the cuisine of the Sanitarium, to prepare a thoroughly hygienic, yet ever-varying, attractive and appetizing menu for its guests, but which soon outgrew its bounds. From it evolved a distinct School of Domestic Economy, and an altogether new system of household cookery, besides a continued succession of cooking classes whose enthusiastic members became teachers to propagate the principles learned, and to teach a better way in diet. Ella Eaton Kellogg, age 60 The following year, in 1885, Kellogg became the associate superintendent of the social purity department of the National WCTU, in connection with Frances E. Willard. Her special charge was the department of Mothers' Meetings, and to her fell the task of arranging the plans of work and the preparing of topics for study. She founded the School of Home Economics (later Battle Creek College). Working with the School of Domestic Economy founded by her and her husband, and other organizations, Kellogg wrote several books, including Science in the Kitchen. Science in the Kitchen, an illustrated cookbook of nearly 600 pages, was the outcome of the scientific and experimental investigation of Kellogg in the realm of dietetics, carried forward during a period of years. \\"Talks to Girls,\\" a social purity pamphlet having a wide sale, was written in 1890. The Kelloggs had no children of own, but they adopted 12 children and raised several not adopted. She was one of the founders and for years manager of the Haskell Home for Orphan Children. Kellogg, during the year, 1892, was named chairman of the World's Fair committee on food supplies for Michigan. She was a charter member, and president of the Michigan Women's Press Association; and a charter member of the American Dietetic Association. She was a member of the household economics department of the Federation of Women's Clubs. She was a member of the WCTU, Y.W.C.A., National Congress of Mothers, American Home Economic Association, and Woman's League, thumb Personal life Kellogg favored woman suffrage. In religion, she was a lifelong Seventh-Day Baptist. The Battle Creek Seventh Day Baptist Church building in Battle Creek, Michigan was dedicated in her honor after it was built in 1929 as seen by a plaque hanging on the outside of their church. Her portrait hangs inside right by the sanctuary. She traveled in Europe, made two trips to Mexico, and visited Cuba, Puerto Rico, California, Colorado, and Florida.

In France, it is the variety with the largest production. This beautiful rustic nut of Ard√®che origin has a bright, streaky chestnut colour. Its fine, sweet and fragrant flesh justifies the excellent taste reputation. The Comballe takes its name from the Combeaux, farmhouse of the canton of Saint- Pierreville, in the mountains of the Ard√®che and Vivarais. It originated in the beginning of the eighteenth century and spread through the region. Its very bright chestnut color features honey reflections with very characteristic dark and regular streaks. Its shape is elliptical elongated. Its tuft is long and fine and its attachment scar (hilum) is large, clear and rectangular. The Comballe is a characteristic variety produced in the Ard√®che, the largest chestnut production region in France. It is so appreciated that it makes up one third of the total production in this region. The tree is particularly suitable for its original region, the Boutieres and the Ard√®che centre. It thrives at 400 m to 650 m elevation in the Cevennes in Ard√®che but also in Loz√®re. Given its superior qualities it has supplanted many local varieties. The flesh of the nut - white, fine, sweet and fragrant - is recognized as one of the best. These taste qualities make the nut good for all uses and preparations including chestnut cream. The Comballe nut peels easily but can have multiple embryos. The late developing pericarp, makes the nut vulnerable to codling and rot in hot and humid autumns. The preservation of the nuts is complicated. Because of its fragile bark, the tree is particularly exposed to chestnut blight. Comballe trees produce high nut yields of sizable caliber: between 30 and 70 nuts per kilogram. A clone of the Comballe named \\"Marron Comballe\\" (CA106) has the advantage of having a nut a little more rarely compartmentalized.

Tourism is a large sources of revenue for Mexico Ecotourism has received mixed responses, but organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) stressed its importance in the long-term economic health of Mexico.  Policy  Ecotourism received support from policymakers as reflected by recent legislation. For example, the General Tourism Law of 2009 prioritizes sustainability in tourism through planning, determining methods for improving tourism resources, and preserving culture and ecological balance. Mexico introduced policies and programs such as the Programme for Sustainable Regional Tourism Development, Pueblos M√°gico, General Tourism Planning of the Territory Programme, and Mexico's Special Climate Change Programme. However, Mexico stated that barriers to adequate infrastructure contribute to environmental challenges in ecotourism. Economy According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, Travel and Tourism contributed MXN 3,100.3 billion (US$165.9 billion) to the Mexican economy in 2016, about 16.0 percent, and was expected to rise by 3.7 percent in 2017. Ecotourism in Mexico faces controversy as tourism displaces other local activities, disadvantaging those not in the industry. Environment Mexico's tourism is not ecologically sustainable. In his analysis of tourism in community ecotourism in Ventanilla, Oaxaca, scientist V. S. Avila Foucat of the University of York recommended developing a code of ethics for tourists and establishing incentives for sustainable community projects. Mexico is home to 42 of UNESCO's Latin America and Caribbean Biosphere Reserves. These sites are popular and important to ecotourism. In Mexico's INDC, as part of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, one of their strategic infrastructure goals is for tourist areas to implement adaptation measures in the case of an extreme event. From 2020-2030, more emphasis was to go to the impact the environment has on tourism. =Monarch Butterfly Reserve of Mexico= The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in west-central Mexico is an example of ecotourism that has existed since the 1980s. It was initially proposed that this would be help alleviate poverty and advance conservation efforts. However, David Barkin provided evidence that this conservation effort has been ineffective on improving poverty in this area, especially for indigenous peoples.NACEC (North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation): 1999, Proceedings of the North American Conference on the Monarch butterfly, Montreal, NACEC. A Monarch Butterfly. Barkin found that despite attracting over 250,000 visitors yearly the Reserve has not generated any local economic development. During the expansion of the Reserve in 2000, the area where forestry activities were completely prohibited expanded. As a result, surrounding local communities lost their main source of income. Although local communities later became involved in the management process, their decisions/proposals are not legally recognized. The National Commission of Protected Areas is the only organization to legally make final decisions. = Xcaret = Xcaret Park is an \\"eco-archeological\\" theme park in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Xcaret features indigenous Mexican culture, combining it with around 50 theme park attractions.

Specifically, Xcaret implements almost all aspects of the UN's Millennium Development Goals into various parts of their business. Moufakkir and Burns are critical of the way Xcaret has developed and used identities of various actors in Mexico and believes that this is a commodification of indigenous cultures for tourism.

Painted by Louisa Sharpe and engraved by J.C. Edwards. From the University of Victoria Libraries Special Collections, call number AY13 K4 1831. Transformation is a short story written by Mary Shelley and first published in 1831 for The Keepsake. Guido, the narrator, tells the story of his encounter with a strange, misshapen creature when he was a young man living in Genoa, Italy, around the turn of the fifteenth century. He makes a deal with the creature to exchange bodies, but the creature does not reappear at the appointed time to take his own body back. Guido discovers that the creature is pretending to be him, kills it and therefore 'himself', and eventually awakens in his own body.  Summary  Guido il Cortese describes how he is sometimes compelled to tell the story of a strange encounter he had with a mysterious creature many years before, when Guido was a young man living in Genoa, Italy. In those days, Guido says, he was reckless and profligate, determined to live a life of pleasure, especially after his father's death left him the master of his family fortune. He became engaged to his childhood playmate Juliet, the beautiful and virtuous daughter of his father's lifelong friend Torella. But before they married, Guido journeyed to Paris, where he squandered his family fortune. Paris was a place of dissipation at this time, during the reign of Charles VI, but the political turmoil that followed the murder of the Duke of Orleans changed this. Guido returned to Genoa, to Torella's house and to Juliet, but Torella told him that by squandering his family fortune, Guido had voided the contract of marriage. Torella, who viewed Guido as a son, offered to settle a fortune on him on the condition that he adhere to certain restrictions. Guido refused to be controlled in this way and left Torella's villa. He attempted to abduct Juliet twice, once with her father, but was unsuccessful. After the second attempt, Guido was banished from Genoa and refused Torella's offers of help. Guido was penniless and alone, and wandered along the seashore in despair. He imagined his revenge on Torella and the people of Genoa, but knew he was completely powerless without fortune. Suddenly, a storm appeared over the water, and Guido watched in horror as a ship was wrecked on the nearby rocks. He could hear the sailors' agony but was powerless to help them. But he saw a strange figure floating to shore, and discovered it to be a misshapen creature--possibly human--riding on a chest. The creature reached the shore and frightened Guido with his blasphemy and horrible appearance. Guido told him a little of his story, and the creature encouraged him to take revenge. When Guido lamented that his lack of wealth prevented this, the creature offered a deal: he would have Guido's body for three days in exchange for the chest he was riding, which was full of treasure. Guido would inhabit the creature's body in the meantime, and would be supplied with food and water while he waited for the creature to return. Guido was horrified, but tempted by the promise of wealth, and agreed. The creature performed the necessary ritual, which included the exchange of blood, and Guido lost consciousness. When he awoke, he was in the body of the creature. He immediately regretted his avarice, but decided to wait the three days for the creature to return. The three days passed, but the creature did not return, and after waiting three more days in despair, Guido in desperation decided to pursue him back to Genoa. He did this with great difficulty in the strange body, travelling at night to avoid being seen. He eventually arrived at Torella's villa, only to discover that the impostor had assumed Guido's rightful place in Torella's family and would shortly be married to Juliet. Enraged, and fearing for Juliet if the marriage were to take place, Guido attacked the creature. They were both severely wounded in the fight, the creature fatally. Guido awakened in his own body once again, and once he recovered, he and Juliet were married. They lived a long, happy life together, but Guido never fully recovers from his injuries, and is haunted by his memory of the encounter with the strange creature.  Publication History  \\"Transformation\\" was first published in The Keepsake for 1831, a British literary annual. It was accompanied by an engraving called Juliet, from a painting by Louisa Sharpe (attributed to \\"Miss Sharpe\\"), engraved by J. C. Edwards. It has been collected in several anthologies since.  Themes and Influences  \\"Transformation\\" is one of several Gothic tales that Mary Shelley published in The Keepsake. Others include \\"Ferdinando Eboli\\" (1829), \\"The Evil Eye\\" (1830), \\"The Invisible Girl\\" (1832), \\"The Dream\\" (1833), and \\"The Mortal Immortal\\" (1834). Like \\"Ferdinando Eboli\\" and Shelley's novel Frankenstein, \\"Transformation\\" explores the Gothic motif of the double, or doppelg√§nger. This motif is common in nineteenth-century Gothic fiction, including, for example, James Hogg's The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1824), Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). \\"Transformation\\" may have been influenced by Lord Byron's unfinished drama The Deformed Transformed (1824), which Mary Shelley transcribed between 1822 and 1823. In terms of form, \\"Transformation\\" is a variation on the Gothic fragment, exemplified by Anna Letitia Aiken's \\"Sir Bertrand: A Fragment\\" (1773). Although it is often categorized as a short story, that form was not named until the 1880s in Britain. It is more accurately classified as a Gothic tale, a story about an experience of the strange or supernatural, often narrated in the first or third person.

Early life  Born on the 24th of June , 1990 into a family of four, Ini Dima-Okojie is the baby of the house. From a background of professionals , Ini was raised by her Medical Doctor father and her mom who was a Banker. They were devoted Catholics. Growing up, Ini was particularly attached to her mother and really wanted to be like her. She admired her beauty, and as a young girl, loved watching her get ready for work; the meticulous manner in which she applied her makeup and her mode of dressing did it for young Ini. Consequently, she developed a personal taste for fashion and though naturally shy, Ini became bold and audacious when it came to her style. In an attempt to be like her mom, she would sneak to her make-up table and experiment with whatever her hands could find. To keep her away from messing up her stuff, her mum would set up a makeshift ‚Äò scarecrow‚Äô - she would put feathers or wigs on her table, knowing those were Ini‚Äôs kryptonite‚Ä¶ she was terrified of them Her older sister, on the other hand, was a child star who starred in ‚ÄúMr. Jack‚Äôs Dog‚Äù, a popular show in the early 1990‚Äôs. The show gave her an opportunity to travel around the world early in life. At a time she traveled to Istanbul, Turkey to film a Turkish dance for the show. The Producers once invited Ini to take a part ut she couldn‚Äôt get herself to doing it because of her inherent shyness. For the longest time , Ini lived in her mind. She would watch Awards shows and dream of being there . After ‚Äôher extraordinary performances before an imaginary audience, she would be nominated for an Award, attend the ceremonies, and of course, win. She would hear the thunderous applause from her adoring spectators. Ini savoured the smiles, accolades, ambience, and fame this charade brought to her young colourful mind. She was a star before the first spotlight ever shone. Early in Junior Secondary school, she was finally persuaded to act in a play. Reluctantly, she accepted. It was quite an emotional play, and many people cried. A major high point was when one of the girls walked up to her and expressed such raw emotions about how she was affected by the performance. This young dreamer could not believe that somewhere inside her, she had what it took to touch people in such a personal way through acting.  Education  Ini attended Air Force Comprehensive Secondary School in Ibadan Nigeria, after which she proceeded to Covenant University also in Nigeria. Her love for fashion remained and in a familiar sort of way, it became the bedrock of her confidence. After graduation and her service year with the Department of Petroleum Resources she applied to and got hired in an investment Bank.  Professional Acting Career  The Passion Ignites She had worked as a banker for nearly two years when a friend sent her the Trailer of a series called ‚ÄúTHE ISLAND‚Äù. The script was fascinating and so different from anything she was familiar with at the time in Nollywood productions. Reading the biographies of the actors, she realized that most of them had gone to Film schools. From that moment, the passion for acting films settled over her like a heavy cloud that would not go away. Her friend Mimi (who had sent the script), added fuel to the fire already burning in her. She started nursing the idea of leaving her job for good and pursuing her passion in acting. Quitting Her Job The desire became so strong that she thought of nothing else. She showed up at work without actually being there. According to Ini, ‚Äò It took me a while to fully accept the facts of what was going on in my life at that time. I made up in my mind to quit my job‚Äô. Unsure of how her mother would react, she describes that she picked the phone and dropped it, picked up the phone again and dropped yet again‚Ä¶over and over ‚ÄòFinally, with a lump in my throat, I picked the phone one day and called my mother‚Äô. Much to her surprise, her mum was very happy and supportive of her decision, she always knew Ini had a knack for it. Her father on the other hand was skeptical, but with her mother on her side, he eventually accepted and they pledged their support. Off to Film School! Ini and her friend Mimi applied to attend the Film Academy in Dubai because it was easier to get a student visa there than New York, which would have been their first choice. They completed the process, made the required payments, and obtained visas, but there was a dramatic turn of events: the Organizers did not have enough applicants for the Academy in Dubai that year so gave three options: make a refund or be transferred to either New York or Los Angeles. New York it was! The experience in the New York Academy forever changed her life. She describes the people, the ambience, the activities as electrifying. They completed the program and returned to Nigeria. Back Home ‚Äì A Star is born Back in Nigeria, the real challenges began. Her very first work was as a Production Assistant with a Production called ‚ÄúBEFORE THIRTY‚Äù, which was being produced by a cousin. She attended as many open auditions as she heard of . At this critical stage, her mother played a major role in my career. She would tell anybody who had an ear, whether they wanted to listen or not, she would tell them about her daughter‚Äôs ‚Äòexcellent acting abilities‚Äô. Having attended several of them , she auditioned for the film, ‚ÄúTASTE OF LOVE‚Äù and landed the role as one of the Lead Actors in the series. This set the ball rolling and her career picked up and has grown both organically exponentially following that. Ini Dima-Okojie is still on the journey and has absolutely no regrets.

It is known by two common names: bog-fern and Massachusetts fern. It is often confused with the silvery spleenwort, New York fern, and the marsh fern due to similarities in shape and size.  Description  Coryphopteris simulata is bright green in color. The frond has some variation in shape, but it is around 61 cm (24 in) long, and its stalk is long and slender at 20.3 cm (8 in). The stalks are thin and slightly scaly, or hairy. The upwards portion is yellow-green in color, and the base is a light brown color. The leaves are monomorphic and pinnately compounded; they can be between 10‚Äì40 cm (3.9-15.7 in) long and 7.6-15.3 cm (3‚Äì6 in) wide. The branching pattern appears to be opposite, but upon close observation it is clearly a slight alternate pattern. The leaf veins are for the most part unbranched, although some branching can be seen towards the lower part of the blade. center Coryphopteris simulata produces both fertile and sterile leaflets. The leaflets are twice-compounded and divided mid-vein into between fifteen to eighteen lobes. They are oblong in shape and become narrower near the axis, noticeably more so near the base. The majority of the leaflets are erect, but the bottom pair point downward. They are around 25‚Äì80 cm (9.8-31.5 in) long. The fertile and sterile leaflets are similar in shape in size, but the fertile leaflets tend to be slightly longer than the sterile leaflets. Sori (singular sorus), are found on the underside of the leaflets, and they are round in shape. The indusium is a pale tan color and is shaped like a kidney. The rhizome is slender and black with some scales. It spreads out far and has a lot of branching. Older roots are short, black, thin, and wiry. There are many young, hairlike rootlets. = Growth = Coryphopteris simulata is a forb/herb perennial. The shoot system sprouts up from a rhizome, which is typically an underground root, but is sometimes found at the ground level. The leaves die and fall off during the wintertime. Spores are produced in the summertime. Taxonomy The species was first described by George Edward Davenport in 1894 as Aspidium simulatum (in the same publication he also suggested that \\"those persons who reject Aspidium\\" could use the synonym Nephrodium simulatum). Genus boundaries in the family Thelypteridaceae have been subject to regular changes; the species has also been placed in Thelypteris (1910), Parathelypteris (1976) and more recently Coryphopteris (2018). , Plants of the World Online accepted the placement in Thelypteris, while the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the placement in Coryphopteris. One distinguishing feature is the sweet-smelling fragrance it emits. Since it has similarities to the marsh fern, New York fern, and silvery spleenwort, people often fail to notice its existence, and have difficulty distinguishing it from the other similar ferns. There is still some confusion today, as this species is relatively uncommon and its shape can be variable.  Distribution  Coryphopteris simulata is a terrestrial plant native to Eastern Canada (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Qu√©bec), the North-Central United States (Wisconsin), the Northeastern United States (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia) and the Southeastern United States (Alabama, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia). The isolated patch discovered in southwestern Wisconsin was far outside its expected distribution. Generally speaking, this plant is uncommon.  Ecology  Coryphopteris simulata grows in shaded, marshy wetlands and bog areas such as cedar, spruce, larch, and sphagnum swamps. It likes to grow among bryophytes, which protect the plant from the sun and provide it with a shady area. It prefers and is most often found in moist, acidic soil that is soft and spongy.

It was adapted as a feature film by EBS, released in 2014.  Plot  One rainy day, 'good luck' comes to the rickshaw man old Kim, who has not seen money for ten days because of bad luck. He was able to get two customers and earn 80 jeon, just in the morning. While going back home, glad that he could buy the Seolleongtang that his ill wife, who had been ill since a few days ago, wanted so much, he met a student who paid 1 won and 50 jeon for a ride. However, even as he is pulling the rickshaw joyfully because of his amazing luck, the words of his wife, \\"Please do not go out today,\\" leaves a heavy feeling on his chest. Nevertheless, after making another round of negotiations with his guests and earning money, he visits the roadside bar to retain the joy of this miraculous moneymaking. As he get drunk in the lively atmosphere of a warm bar, old Kim tries to throw out his ominous thoughts about his wife, throwing away the 'resentful money' and crying and laughing like crazy. At last, when old Kim, who was drunk heavily, comes to the house after buying the Seolleongtang, his wife was already dead and only his baby who was sucking the empty nipple of his wife was waiting for him. Old Kim's oddly fortunate day ends with him crying out alone because of the death of his wife.  Characters  = Old Kim = Old man Kim (Kim Cheomji) is a poor rickshaw man who has a family of a wife and one son. He is violent, cursing and hitting his wife. But he also loves his wife a lot, buying seolleongtang for his wife, and mourning at his wife's death. He represents the miserable life of the poor in . = Kim's wife = She is a wife of a poor rickshaw man, and is ill. She couldn't eat anything for a long time, and her last wish before death was eating selleongtang. However, she couldn't fulfill her wish.  Setting  ‚ÄúOne Lucky Day‚Äù is a novel published in 1924, which is set in Seoul during the Japanese forced occupation of Korea. The lives of people who were living in Seoul at that time, and the appearance of Seoul is written inside the novel. = Modern day Seoul = Seoul during the 1920s was starting to turn into a modern city. Modern factories, schools, and hospitals were starting to form around Seoul. This is noticeable in ‚ÄúOne lucky day‚Äù, as the rickshaw that Kim is driving was a popular form of transportation, because the citizens of Seoul during the 1920s needed an easy-to-use transportation due to their busy everyday life. The fact that there were already train rails and stations, and the fact that there were modern schools and hospitals is also written inside the novel.Í∞ïÏó∞Ï§Ä (2013), Íµ≠Ïñ¥ÏÑ†ÏÉùÎãòÎèÑ Í∂ÅÍ∏àÌïú 101Í∞ÄÏßÄ Î¨∏ÌïôÏßàÎ¨∏ÏÇ¨Ï†Ñ, Î∂ÅÎ©òÌÜ†, p.380, = Life of the lower class citizens = However, while the settings of ‚ÄúOne Lucky Day‚Äù was Seoul, a modern city, Hyun Jin-geon focuses on the daily life of lower class citizens in the story, and how harsh it was. In the story, Kim conflicts between earning money to sustain life, and looking after his dying wife. This shows the pitiful life of lower class citizens during the Japanese forced occupation, who couldn't do much and had to go out and earn money, even when their wife was dying. The setting of ‚ÄúOne Lucky Day‚Äù, Seoul, was already starting to become a modern city during the 1920s. However, there were still a lot of people working hard to survive day by day. There were a lot of ‚ÄúKim‚Äùs out there, living difficultly. Seoul was full of lower class citizens who were tormented by poverty, and this poverty is the problem that Hyun Jin-geon, along with other realism authors at that time, tried to point out with the settings of their stories.  Literacy significance and criticism  This novel is a work that is very precisely structured toward a single focus, in which its tragic effects are revealed by irony. Also, the background of the rain is set very methodically. The image of the uncontrollable winter rain that is constantly reminded is not only a functional background to illustrate the death of his wife, but also symbolizes the gloomy environment in which Kim is located. It represents the poor life of the lower classes in the colonial city. This shows that the author is not idealizing reality, but is rather grasping its true form. In the end, Kim is not a special individual, but a representative of the suffering colonial people. The creation of a personality typology such as Kim was also in the context of the rise of the sympathetic literature (New Trends Literature), which mainly dealt with the lives of the people in the mid-1920s. Also, paying attention to the literary transformation of the author, this work was the starting point of clearing out his early autobiographical novels centered on the intellectuals, facing the reality of the colonialism and pursuing the destiny of the populace, the greatest victim of colonialism. Above all, this work has the most appropriate combination of social consciousness and ironic short - form style out of all the novels written by Hyun_Jin-geon.

The novel begins in Shanghai, depicted as modern and well-off, in 1950. The main character, after awakening, learns that Dr. Su Hanmin, the inventor of a spiritual medicine, used it to pull Chinese away from opium-laden dependence on Westerners as they become willing to help others, allowing them to become prosperous. (translated into English by Ken Liu) The foreign concessions were dissolved. By 1950 China has a surplus in funds, as well as established universities and a thriving industrial sector. It has incorporated Tibet as one of its provinces, and in China male and female citizens possess the same rights. Xin Zhongguo depicted a universal exposition in Shanghai. The novel reveals that the protagonist was merely dreaming about this new China, and that it had not yet happened.

The sole example was modified into a more powerful two-seater which served aeroclubs until World War II. Design and development After the Medwecki HL 2 was badly damaged in a forced landing during the First National Lightplane Contest held in Poland in October 1927, Jozef Medwecki chose not to rebuild it for the following year's contest but to submit a new design. His collaboration with Zygmunt Nowakowski produced the single engine, four seat, braced parasol wing M.N.3. They received funding from L.O.P.P and assistance from Samolot, Medwecki's employer. The M.N.3's wing was built in two parts around pairs of wooden spars and was plywood covered. It was essentially rectangular in plan, though with rounded tips and a small central cut-out in the trailing edge to improve the pilot's field of view. The half-wings joined over the fuselage, supported on a low cabane, but parallel steel tubes, enclosed in wooden streamlined fairings and stiffened with lighter N-struts between the lower fuselage and the spars, provided the primary bracing. The four seat M.N.3 had been designed to be powered by a engine but initially all that was available was a loaned and reconditioned Anzani 6 six cylinder radial which produced . It was mounted, uncowled in the nose. The fuselage had a rectangular section apart from the rounded upper decking and held two tandem cockpits, each wide enough to seat two side by side. The forward seats were under the wing and the other, seating the pilot, below the trailing edge. As on the Medwecki HL 2 the forward seats were entered via a car-type door with a special lock that maintained the integrity of the upper longeron; the cockpit, without the obstacle of the wing, could be entered over its side. The M.N.3's empennage was conventional, with a triangular fin mounting an essentially rectangular rudder. Its tailplane was mounted near the top of the fuselage and was rigidly braced, though its angle of incidence was ground-adjustable. The elevators were divided to allow rudder movement. The fixed landing gear was also conventional, with mainwheels on a single axle supported on V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons below the wing strut joints. Rubber cords in the apexes of the V-struts acted as shock absorbers. The first flight was made in late September 1928. Despite the lack of power it was able to carry three passengers and handled well. Without the passengers it could perform simple aerobatics. On the flight to the Second National Lightplane Contest in late October it suffered engine problems and had to make an emergency landing. Though it was not seriously damaged in the landing, its designers decided to convert the M.N.3 into a two-seater, designated the M.N.4. Partly because they were busy working on their final joint design, the Medwecki and Nowakowski M.N.5, and partly because of the closure of Samolot, the conversion was not completed until 1932. The main improvement was replacement of the Anzani engine by a Cirrus III upright four- cylinder, air-cooled inline. In addition, the front cockpit and the wing strut fairings were removed. These changes increased the empty weight by 34%. Its maximum speed was , it could climb to in 4 min 20 s and had a service ceiling of . Operational history After obtaining its certificate of airworthiness the sole N.M.4 was used by the P.W.S. flying club for about a year, then moved to the Gda≈Ñsk club where it flew into the late 30s, participating in many meetings and regional and national competitions. In 1933 it competed in the Fifth National Lightplane Contest. Flown by Stefan Krynski, it came eleventh out of twenty-six.

It is an adaptation of the 1943 novel of the same name by American author Ayn Rand. The story focuses on Howard Roark, an individualistic architect who designs modernist buildings and refuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation. The production, running more than four hours, uses video projections to show close-ups of the actors and Roark's drawings, as well as backgrounds of the New York skyline. Since its debut at the Holland Festival in June 2014, the play has received mostly positive reviews from European critics for productions in the Netherlands, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. American critics gave mostly negative reviews to a production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival in 2017. Plot Howard Roark, a modernist architect who refuses to follow traditional styles, struggles to develop a successful career. He competes with rival architects Peter Keating and Guy Francon, who copy past buildings to achieve public acceptance. Roark has an affair with Francon's daughter Dominique, who later marries newspaper magnate Gail Wynand. Roark agrees to help Keating with the design of a housing project. When the terms of their agreement are broken, Roark demolishes the building and is prosecuted. Roark is acquitted, and Dominique leaves Wynand to be with Roark.

Author Ayn Rand's bestselling novel The Fountainhead, a 700-page epic, was published in 1943. Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, the artistic director for the Dutch theater company Toneelgroep Amsterdam, was given a copy of the novel as a gift in 2007. After reading it, he was immediately interested in adapting it for the stage, but he was not able to secure the adaptation rights until 2012. The four-hour-plus production debuted at the Holland Festival on 15 June 2014. Ramsey Nasr starred as Howard Roark, with Halina Reijn as Dominique Francon. After its debut the play went on tour, appearing in Barcelona, Spain, in early July 2014 and at the Festival d'Avignon in France later that month. The play appeared at the Od√©on-Th√©√¢tre de l'Europe in Paris in November 2016. The company traveled to the Republic of Korea in 2017, presenting the play at the LG Arts Center in Seoul from 31 March to 2 April. Later in 2017, the play had its first American production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival, where it ran from 28 November to 2 December. The play debuted in the United Kingdom at the Manchester International Festival in July 2019. Reception The European productions of the play received mostly positive reviews. The Festival d'Avignon production received positive from the French newspapers La Croix, Les √âchos, and Le Monde, as well as from the English newspaper The Guardian, whose reviewer described it as \\"electrifying theatre\\". The French magazine T√©l√©rama gave the Avignon production a negative review, calling the source material inferior and complaining about the use of video screens on the set, while another French magazine, La Terrasse, complimented the staging and acting of the Od√©on production. American critics gave mostly negative reviews of the Next Wave Festival production. Helen Shaw's review for The Village Voice said the adaptation was unwatchable because it portrayed Rand's characters and views seriously without undercutting them. The reviewer for the Financial Times said the play was too long and that van Hove had approached Rand's \\"noxious\\" book with too much reverence. In a mixed review for The New York Times, critic Ben Brantley complimented van Hove for capturing Rand's \\"sheer pulp appeal\\", but described the material as \\"hokum with a whole lot of ponderous speeches\\". A review for The Huffington Post complimented van Hove's ability to portray Rand's message, but said the play was an hour too long. When the play appeared at the Manchester International Festival, the reviewer for The Times said it was engaging for the first three hours, but dragged in the final hour. In The Guardian, Michael Billington criticized the choice of source material, but said the production was inventively staged and showed van Hove's \\"characteristic virtuosity\\".

The cold spell consisted of very low temperatures and significant snowfall. Freezing temperatures worsened due to the significant overcast and cloud covered skies. Extensive snowfall occurred on 11 and 12March in the South East, North and West of England and Wales. Most parts of England, north Wales and the Isle of Man also suffered heavy persistent snowfall on 22 and 23March 2013. Overview During the cold spell, the low temperatures were not extreme, yet they were notable because of the extended duration of below average temperatures. Official weather reports show that temperatures stayed below 0¬∞C (32¬∞F) for nine consecutive days.http://trevorharley.com/weather_web_pages/british_weather_in_march.htm March 2013 was reported to be tied for the country's fourth-coldest March since 1910. Mean temperatures were 2.5 to 3¬∞C (4 to 5¬∞F) below-average from February to early April, and there was a continuous, strong, cold easterly wind. 31March was confirmed by the Met Office as the coldest Easter Day on record, with the lowest temperature reaching in Braemar.

Areas of Northwest England, North Wales, Southwest Scotland and Northern Ireland were affected the most. Up to of snow was reported to have fallen with up to snow drifts. There was a continuous covering of snow throughout the country from 11March to 1April. Moreover, from the 22 of March the Isle of Man recorded its heaviest snowfall since 1963. Strong winds and very heavy snowfall resulted in horrendous conditions with drifts up to 4 foot deep particularly across eastern half of the island. Consequently, roads on the island were extremely hazardous with blockages, hundreds of homes left without power and a significant loss of livestock. =Impact= The cold weather caused several problems with electricity, agriculture and road networks. Some migratory birds such as the chiffchaff, sand martin, willow warbler, blackcap, and the little-ringed plover arrived late in 2013 as a result of the abnormally harsh weather. The spring germination and growth of plants was delayed, affecting nurserymen and market gardeners, and causing the daffodil flower crop to bloom too late for Mothering Sunday and Easter. There were also significant issues with livestock, especially mass deaths of sheep and newborn lambs.. As an example of the delay to nature, bluebells were observed in full bloom as late as June 2nd in woodland near to Maiden Bradley, Wiltshire, in normally-mild central southern England and around a month later than the typical season.

She became interested in dance through the agency of her grandmother, and later worked as an actress in the experimental theater in Samarkand. She fused traditional Uzbek dance and western classical dance in her performances, presenting versions of each alongside one another. The choreography which she produced for many traditional dances, such as the tanovar dances, remain the standard by which other performances are judged. In 1939 she was involved in the establishment of Muqimi, the first musical theater in Uzbekistan, having previously choreographed the ballet Pakhta (Cotton) there in 1933; she also worked on Shakhida, about the battle against the basmachi, in 1938. She founded the Bahor Ensemble in 1957; still a highly regarded performing group in contemporary Uzbekistan, it credits her as the choreographer of many of its repertory pieces. For her work she was named a People's Artist of Uzbekistan. A museum dedicated to Turgunbaeva and her work exists in Tashkent.

The chaekgeori tradition flourished from the second half of the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and was enjoyed by all members of the population, from the king to the commoners, revealing the infatuation with books and learning in Korean culture. Names Chaekgeori that features bookshelves is called chaekgado (). Chaekgeori is also known as munbangdo (). History During the 18th century, Joseon experienced a golden age following the turbulence of the 17th century; the arts flourished, and new artistic themes and genres emerged. Developed in the 18th century, chaekgeori was personally propagated by King Jeongjo, a bibliophile who promoted studious learning, and embraced by the aristocratic yangban class of Joseon society. Early chaekgeori paintings were prized for their illusionistic realism. In the 19th century, chaekgeori spread to the minhwa folk art of the common class, which resulted in more expressionist and abstract depictions, and the diminished prominence of bookshelves as a primary motif. Court chaekgeori were used in both ritual ceremonies and as decoration, but minhwa chaekgeori were displayed solely as a decoration in homes. Influences King Jeongjo promoted cultural exchange with the Qing dynasty, leading to increased exposure and importation of Chinese and European cultural items. Some of the depicted items in chaekgeori are of foreign origin from China, Japan, and the West. Chaekgado incorporated Western linear perspective and shading techniques, and the depicted bookshelves reveal influence of the duobaoge treasure cabinets of the Qing dynasty, though more symmetrical and systematic. The duobaoge itself was influenced by the European cabinet of curiosities brought into China by Jesuit missionaries.

One of the temples inscriptions contains the earliest known inscription of the circular symbol \\"O\\", to represent zero, in India, though the Bakhshali manuscript is regarded as the earliest existent use of zero.https://www.livemint.com/Science/MSxVoPsCyzUQcvUMh10hDN/1800yearold- black-dot-in-Bakhshali-manuscript-is-first-z.html The inscription states, among other things, that the community planted a garden of 187 hastas by 270 hastas (1 hasta = 1.5 feet), that the garden yielded 50 garlands for the temple everyday. The last digits of 270 and 50 are \\"O\\" shaped. While Indian and non-Indian texts mention zero much earlier, this temple has the earliest known epigraphical evidence inscribed in stone that already knows and uses the concept of zero. It is a relative small temple with a square plan of side. The temple has a portico at its entrance supported by four carved pillars. The pillars show reliefs of individuals meditating in yoga asana position, as well as amorous couples. To the right of the portico is covered pillared mandapa, like a choultry. The doorway into the rock is flanked by goddess Ganga and Yamuna. The ceiling of the temple is a low square pyramid, similar to the Dhamnar temple. The tower (Shikhara) of the temple is North Indian Nagara style, that slowly curves with a square plan, all carved out of the monolithic rock. It has an inscription that opens with a praise for Vishnu (Vaishnavism), then Shiva (Shaivism) and nine Durgas (Shaktism), as well states that it was excavated in 876 CE (Samvat 933). Inside there is a wall relief of Varaha (Vishnu's man-boar avatar) and another of four armed Vishnu. It also a carving of goddess Lakshmi with four arms.

Set in 1962, the film is inspired by the true story of a tour of the Deep South by African American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank \\"Tony Lip\\" Vallelonga who served as Shirley's driver and bodyguard. The film was written by Farrelly, Brian Hayes Currie and Vallelonga's son, Nick Vallelonga, based on interviews with his father and Shirley, as well as letters his father wrote to his mother. The film is named after The Negro Motorist Green Book, a mid-20th century guidebook for African-American travelers written by Victor Hugo Green. Green Book had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2018, where it won the People's Choice Award. It was then theatrically released in the United States on November 16, 2018, by Universal Pictures, and grossed $328 million worldwide. The film received largely positive reviews, with praise for Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali's performances, although it also drew some criticism of its depiction of both race and Shirley. Green Book received numerous accolades and nominations, and at the 91st Academy Awards, it won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Ali. The film also won the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture, the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy, the National Board of Review award for the best film of 2018, and was chosen as one of the top 10 films of the year by the American Film Institute. Ali also won the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA awards for Best Supporting Actor. Plot In 1962 New York City, bouncer Tony Lip searches for new employment after the nightclub he works at, Copacabana, is closed for renovations. He is invited to an interview with Dr. Don Shirley, a black pianist in need of a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South. Don hires Tony on the strength of his references. They embark with plans to return to New York City on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of the Green Book, a guide for African-American travelers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve them. They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading farther south. Tony and Don initially clash as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act with more refinement, while Don is disgusted by Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and is increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment which Don receives from his hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. A group of white men beat Don and threaten his life in a bar and Tony rescues him. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour. Throughout the journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, which deeply move her. Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that he has become isolated by his professional life and achievements. In the south, Don is found in a gay encounter with a white man at a pool, and Tony bribes the officers to prevent the musician's arrest. Later, the two are arrested after a police officer pulls them over late at night in a sundown town; Tony punches the officer after being insulted. While they are incarcerated, Don asks to call his lawyer and uses the opportunity to reach Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who pressures the governor to release them. On the night of the final performance on tour in Birmingham, Alabama, Don is refused entry into the whites-only dining room of the country club where he has been hired to perform. Tony threatens the owner, and Don refuses to play since they refuse to serve him in the room with his audience. Tony and Don have dinner at a predominantly black blues club where Don joins the band on the piano, after playing Chopin's √âtude in A minor. Tony and Don head back north to try to make it home by Christmas Eve. Tony invites Don to have dinner with his family, but he declines and returns to his own home. Sitting alone in his home, Don decides to go back to Tony's home, where he is warmly greeted. The end title cards show real life photos of the characters and state that Don continued to tour, compose and record songs, while Tony went back to his work at Copacabana. It also states that Tony and Don remained friends until they died, within months of each other, in 2013. Cast In addition, Tony and Dolores Vallelonga's son, Frank Jr., appears as his own uncle, Rudy (Rodolfo) Vallelonga (who says, \\"I'm just saying, we're an arty family\\"), while their younger son (and the film's co-producer and co-screenwriter), Nick, appears as Augie, the Mafioso who offers Tony a job doing \\"things\\" while the Copacabana is under renovation.

Production Viggo Mortensen began negotiations to star in the film in May 2017 and was required to gain 40‚Äì50 pounds (18‚Äì23 kg) for the role. Peter Farrelly was set to direct from a screenplay written by Nick Vallelonga (Tony Lip's son), Brian Currie, and himself. On November 30, 2017, the lead cast was set with Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardellini and Iqbal Theba confirmed to star. Production began that week in New Orleans. Sebastian Maniscalco was announced as part of the cast in January 2018. Score composer Kris Bowers also taught Ali basic piano skills and was the stand-in when closeups of hands playing were required. =Writing= The Negro Motorist Green-Book listed businesses that served black travelers in the segregated South. The script was written by Vallelonga's son Nick Vallelonga, as well as Brian Hayes Currie and Peter Farrelly, in consultation with the Shirley family and estate. = Music = For the film's soundtrack, Farrelly incorporated an original score by composer Kris Bowers and one of Shirley's own recordings. The soundtrack also includes rarities from 1950s and 1960s American music recommended to him by singer Robert Plant, who was dating a friend of Farrelly's wife at the time he had finished the film's script. During dinner on a double date, his wife and her friend stepped outside to smoke and the director asked Plant for advice on picking songs for the film that would be relatively unknown to contemporary audiences. This prompted Plant to play Farrelly songs via YouTube, including Sonny Boy Williamson II's \\"Pretty 'Lil Thing\\" and Robert Mosley's \\"Goodbye, My Lover, Goodbye.\\" In an interview with Forbes, the director explained that the soundtrack ended up not only avoiding rote nostalgia, \\"but also those songs were really inexpensive and I did not have a huge budget so I was able to come up with some sensational pop songs from the time that were long forgotten.\\" The music played at the black blues club toward the end of the film featured the piano performance of √âtude Op. 25, No. 11 (Chopin), known as the Winter Wind etude by Chopin, was not included in the soundtrack release. A soundtrack album was released on November 30, 2018, by Milan Records, featuring Bowers' score, songs from the plot's era, and a piano recording by Shirley. According to the label, it was streamed approximately 10,000 times per day during January 2019. This rate doubled the next month as the album surpassed one million streams worldwide and became the highest-streamed jazz soundtrack in Milan's history. Release Green Book began a limited release in the United States, in 20 cities, on November 16, 2018, and expanded wide on November 21, 2018. The film was previously scheduled to begin its release on the 21st. The studio spent an estimated $37.5 million on prints and advertisements for the film. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2018. It also opened the 29th New Orleans Film Festival on October 17, 2018, screened at AFI Fest on November 9, 2018 and was programmed as the surprise film at the BFI London Film Festival. On November 7, 2018, during a promotional panel discussion, Mortensen said the word \\"nigger\\".

Mortensen apologized the next day, saying that \\"my intention was to speak strongly against racism\\" and that he was \\"very sorry that I did use the full word last night, and will not utter it again\\". =Home media= Green Book was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 12, 2019. The film was made available for purchase on streaming video in digital HD from Amazon Video and iTunes on February 19, 2019.DVD Release Dates for Green Book. March 12, 2019 Reception =Box office= Green Book grossed $85.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $244.6 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $329.7 million, against a production budget of $23 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $106 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues. The film made $312,000 from 25 theaters in its opening weekend, an average of $12,480 per venue, which Deadline Hollywood called \\"not good at all\\", although TheWrap said it was a \\"successful start,\\" and noted strong word-of-mouth would likely help it going into its wide release. The film had its wide expansion alongside the openings of Ralph Breaks the Internet, Robin Hood and Creed II, and was projected to gross around $7‚Äì9 million over the five-day weekend, November 21 to 25. It made $908,000 on its first day of wide release and $1 million on its second. It grossed $5.4 million over the three-day weekend (and $7.4 million over the five), finishing ninth. Deadline wrote that the opening was \\"far from where [it needed] to be to be considered a success,\\" and that strong audience word of mouth and impending award nominations would be needed in order to help the film develop box office legs. Rival studios argued that Universal went too wide too fast: from 25 theaters to 1,063 in less than a week. In its second weekend the film made $3.9 million, falling just 29% and leading some industry insiders to think achieve $50 million during awards season. In its third weekend of wide release, following its Golden Globe nominations, it dropped 0% and again made $3.9 million, then made $2.8 million the following weekend. In its eighth weekend, the film made $1.8 million (continuing to hold well, dropping just 3% from the previous week). It then made $2.1 million in its ninth weekend (up 18%) and $2.1 million in its 10th. In the film's 11th week of release, following the announcement of its five Oscar nominations, it was added to 1,518 theaters (for a total of 2,430) and made $5.4 million, an increase of 150% from the previous weekend and finishing sixth at the box office. The weekend following its Best Picture win, the film was added to 1,388 theaters (for a total of 2,641) and made $4.7 million, finishing fifth at the box office. It marked a 121% increase from the previous week, as well as one of the best post-Best Picture win bumps ever, and largest since The King's Speech in 2011. Green Book was a surprise success overseas, especially in China where it debuted to a much higher-than-expected $17.3 million, immediately becoming the second highest-grossing Best Picture winner in the country behind Titanic (1997). As of March 7, 2019, the largest international markets for the film were China ($26.7 million), France ($10.7 million), the United Kingdom ($10 million), Australia ($7.8 million) and Italy ($8.6 million). By March 13, China's total had grown to $44.5 million. On March 31 the film passed $300 million at the global box office, including $219 million from overseas territories. Its largest markets to-date were China ($70.7 million), Japan ($14.6 million), France ($14 million) Germany ($13.5 million) and the UK ($12.9 million). =Critical response= Mahershala Ali, who portrayed Don Shirley, won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Green Book takes audiences on a surprisingly smooth ride through potentially bumpy subject matter, fueled by Peter Farrelly's deft touch and a pair of well-matched leads.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \\"A+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 91% positive score, with 80% saying they would definitely recommend it. Writing for The San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle praised Ali and Mortensen and said: \\"...there's something so deeply right about this movie, so true to the time depicted and so welcome in this moment; so light in its touch, so properly respectful of its characters, and so big in its spirit, that the movie acquires a glow. It achieves that glow slowly, but by the middle and certainly by the end, it's there, the sense of something magical happening, on screen and within the audience.\\" Steve Pond of TheWrap wrote, \\"The movie gets darker as the journey goes further South, and as the myriad indignities and humiliations mount. But our investment in the characters rarely flags, thanks to Mortensen and Ali and a director who is interested in cleanly and efficiently delivering a story worth hearing.\\" Jazz artist Quincy Jones said to a crowd after a screening: \\"I had the pleasure of being acquainted with Don Shirley while I was working as an arranger in New York in the '50s, and he was without question one of America's greatest pianists ... as skilled a musician as Leonard Bernstein or Van Cliburn ... So it is wonderful that his story is finally being told and celebrated. Mahershala, you did an absolutely fantastic job playing him, and I think yours and Viggo's performances will go down as one of the great friendships captured on film.\\" =Accolades= Green Book has received numerous award nominations. In addition to winning the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2018,\\"TIFF 2018 Awards: ‚ÄòGreen Book‚Äô Wins the People‚Äôs Choice Award, Upsetting ‚ÄòA Star Is Born‚Äô\\". IndieWire, September 16, 2018. Green Book was nominated for five awards at the 91st Academy Awards, winning three awards for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Mahershala Ali. Green Book was the fifth film to win Best Picture without a Best Director nomination. Green Book had five nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, with the film winning Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy. The National Board of Review awarded it Best Film, and it was also recognized as one of the Top 10 films of the year by the American Film Institute. Controversies =Shirley family reaction= Shirley's relatives condemned the film, stating that they were not contacted by studio representatives until after development, and that it misrepresented Shirley's relationship with his family. Don's brother Maurice Shirley said, \\"My brother never considered Tony to be his 'friend'; he was an employee, his chauffeur (who resented wearing a uniform and cap). This is why context and nuance are so important. The fact that a successful, well-to-do black artist would employ domestics that did NOT look like him, should not be lost in translation.\\" Some of Maurice Shirley's statements contradict an audio recording from \\"Lost Bohemia\\", which featured interviews with Don Shirley and Vallelonga. In one of them, Shirley said that \\"I trusted him implicitly. You see, Tony got to be, not only was he my driver. We never had an employer/employee relationship\\". The interviews also support other events depicted in the film. Mahershala Ali responded with an apology to Shirley's nephew Edwin Shirley III, saying that \\"I did the best I could with the material I had\\" and that he was not aware that there were \\"close relatives with whom I could have consulted to add some nuance to the character\\". Writer-director Peter Farrelly said that he was under the impression that there \\"weren't a lot of family members\\" still alive, that they did not take major liberties with the story, and that relatives of whom he was aware had been invited to a private screening for friends and family. Nick Vallelonga, the film's co-writer and Tony Vallelonga's son, acknowledged that members of the Shirley family were hurt that he did not speak to them and that he was sorry they were offended. He told Variety that \\"Don Shirley himself told me not to speak to anyone\\" and that Shirley \\"approved what I put in and didn't put in.\\" =Concerns about depiction of race= The film has been criticized for advancing a white savior narrative in film that perpetuates stereotypes. Salon said the film combines \\"the white savior trope with the story of a bigot's redemption\\". Peter Farrelly told Entertainment Weekly that he was aware of the white savior trope before filming and sought to avoid it. He said he had long discussions with the actors and producers on the point, and believes that it was not advanced by the film, saying it is \\"about two guys who were complete opposites and found a common ground, and it's not one guy saving the other. It's both saving each other and pulling each other into some place where they could bond and form a lifetime friendship.\\" New York Times writer Wesley Morris characterized Green Book as being a \\"racial reconciliation fantasy\\". Morris argues that the film represents a specific style of racial storytelling \\"in which the wheels of interracial friendship are greased by employment, in which prolonged exposure to the black half of the duo enhances the humanity of his white, frequently racist counterpart\\". Writing a positive appreciation in The Hollywood Reporter, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar noted that \\"filmmakers are history‚Äôs interpreters, not its chroniclers.\\" See also * Jim Crow laws * List of black films of the 2010s References  Further reading  * An interview with director Peter Farrelly and composer Kris Bowers about the film's soundtrack.

It has a single, smooth, tube-shaped leaf with a reddish-purple base and up to ten greenish flowers. It is a rare species found only in a few locations in South Australia and in far western Victoria. Description Prasophyllum occultans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single smooth, tube-shaped leaf which is long and in diameter near its reddish-purple base. The flowering stem emerges about half-way along the leaf. Between four and ten greenish and dull brown flowers are arranged on the flowering stem which is long. The ovary is long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is green with a brownish tip, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are greenish with brown marks, lance-shaped, long, wide and free from each other. The petals are green with a dull brown stripe, linear to oblong, long and wide. The labellum is greenish-white, egg-shaped to lance- shaped, long, about wide and turns upward at 90¬∞ about half-way along. The upturned part is triangular with a wavy edge and there is a greenish-brown callus in its centre. Flowering occurs in September and early October and the flowers are \\"apparently apomictic\\". Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum occultans was first formally described in 1989 by Robert Bates and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden from a specimen collected in the Lincoln Conservation Park. The specific epithet (occultans) is a Latin word meaning \\"hidden\\" or \\"concealed\\", referring to the difficulty of finding this orchid, due to its size and coloration. Distribution and habitat The hidden leek orchid mostly in mallee-broombush and is found on the Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, upper South-Eastern botanical region of South Australia and possibly Kangaroo Island. There is a single record from far western Victoria.

In: L'Antiquit√© Classique Vol. 40, 1971, pp. 1‚Äì4 (with portrait picture) Education and career Adolphe Rome studied at the Atheneum in Mechelen, where his father Eug√®ne Rome was a teacher of ancient languages. After graduating from the Atheneum, he entered the Catholic seminary in Mechelen and in 1912 was ordained a priest. He then studied classical philology at the University of Louvain and received there, after an interruption of his studies by WWI, his doctorate in 1919. He then worked as a teacher in Schaerbeek and Nivelles and in 1922 received a scholarship at the Institut historique belge de Rome in Rome. From 1924 to 1927 in Paris he studied ancient and medieval calligraphy. From 1927 he taught Greek philology at the University of Louvain, where he was appointed professor in 1929 and taught until 1958. In 1935 he became honorary canon of the cathedral of Mechelen. During his doctoral studies, Adolphe Rome, who was very interested in mathematics since his school days, settled upon his life-long field of research, the ancient history of science. He received his doctorate with the thesis Les fonctions trigonom√©triques dans H√©ron d'Alexandrie. Starting in the 1920s he began writing a critical edition (published from 1931 to 1943) of the commentaries on the Almagest of Ptolemy and the works of Theon of Alexandria , later continued by his student and successor Joseph Mogenet (1913‚Äì1980) and his student Anne Tihon (born 1944). Another of Rome's close associates was Albert Lejeune (1916‚Äì1988). In addition to his research on the ancient history of science, Rome published essays on many topics of classical philology, such as the works of Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides and Theocritus. In 1932 he was one of the co-founders of the magazine L'Antiquit√© classique. In the 1950s, he became editor-in-chief of the science-historical journal Isis . Adolphe Rome was elected a corresponding member in 1948 and in 1950 a regular member of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium. In 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) on The calculation of an eclipse of the sun according to Theon of Alexandria.

Mary Ethel Leach (1850 or 1851 - April 1936) was a British politician. Life Leach grew up in Great Yarmouth and married an ironmonger, the couple sharing a commitment to radical politics. In 1881, she was elected to the Great Yarmouth School Board as an independent. School provision in the area was then poor, and she championed kindergarten methods of teaching younger children. Within six months, she persuaded the rest of the board to adopt this measure. Leach discovered that a pupil at the local industrial school had been hit with a trowel and organised a public enquiry into the matter. The enquiry found no evidence of similar incidents, so decided to take no action. Leach arranged to be appointed as the school's matron, reducing the use of corporal punishment. However, eighteen months later, the school board believed that the school regime was too soft, and replaced her with a male superintendent. With more free time, Leach began teaching cookery in schools. She also campaigned against after-hours teaching, which she believed put unnecessary pressure on pupils. Concerned by malnourishment among pupils, she introduced 1d dinners, later complementing these with 1d lunches. She long tried to persuade the board to remit the fees of poor pupils, and finally succeeded in 1886. In 1889, Leach convinced the board to set up a pupil teacher training scheme to improve the quality of teaching in schools, and the following year, she got the school leaving age raised. Leach was Helen Taylor's agent Leach's many achievements attracted widespread attention; she was elected to the committee of the National Educational Association, and lectured for the Land and Labour League. She was active in the women's suffrage movement from the early 1880s. In 1885, she was election agent to Helen Taylor's campaign in Camberwell North at the 1885 UK general election, although the returning officer refused to accept Taylor's papers, as women were not permitted to stand. Leach gradually increased her vote in school board elections, and by 1890 was able to take second place. By this time, she stood as a Liberal Party representative, but this had little impact on her activity, and she refused to campaign jointly with other Liberal candidates in the elections. In 1895, she was elected as vice-chair of the school board, and by this time she was also able to win election to the Board of Guardians. There, she campaigned for reforms to nursing and childcare in the town. However, the clerk of the board, a Mr Palmer, opposed her activities, refusing her access to his office to view minutes of meetings. When he requested a ¬£30 pay rise, she argued that a ¬£3 raise should suffice. Around this time, Palmer circulated a cartoon at a meeting which implied an affair between a medical officer and a nurse. Leach took the opportunity to call a public enquiry into his conduct; Palmer was only reprimanded, but his mental health suffered and he was remanded to an asylum. He was dismissed, and Leach was thereafter able to participate fully as a member of the board. In 1908, Leach stood for the Gorleston ward on Yarmouth Town Council. Her campaign attracted national interest, and she appeared on the front page of the Daily Mirror, but she was not elected. She did become a councillor after World War I, later serving as an alderman and the first woman mayor of the town. She was also first woman to become a magistrate in the town. Leach was still serving on the council in 1932, when she opened Alderman Leach Secondary Modern School. This later became East Norfolk Sixth Form College, which houses a picture of Leach.

Formation Since the 1960s, the Labour Party has relied for vital votes on Britain's large African, Caribbean and Asian (\\"politically Black\\") communities, its demographically most loyal supporters, in urban areas. Over time, Black people stood in local council elections, and even as candidates for the Westminster Parliament. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, these candidates were often put by Labour in seats where they stood no chance of winning. The Labour Party Black Sections debate emerged in the context of African, Caribbean and Asian voting patterns gaining prominence from 1974. The call for Black Sections among Black Labour Party activists came from their realisation of the significance of Black votes, particularly in areas with a high concentration of African Caribbean and Asian people. Black members active in the Labour Party argued for greater representation in return for the electoral support of their communities. The English youth riots/uprisings that occurred at the start of the 1980s, in St Pauls, Bristol (1980) and in 1981, Brixton, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, and elsewhere, acted as a warning to a British society that was indifferent or hostile to the demands of disenfranchised and disadvantaged Black people. These urban disturbances, that some commentators called \\"uprisings\\", provided Black Labour activists (several of them middle-class professionals, observed Black radical Darcus Howe, who wrote a Race Today pamphlet about Black Sections) with greater political leverage in their arguments. While the rise of the Labour municipal left-wing, of prominent figures, including Ken Livingstone, in local government, particularly in London, created the opportunity to place the issue of Black representation firmly on the political agenda. Parallel organisations within the trade unions, such as the Nalgo Black Workers group in town halls, of Judy Bashir and Azim Hajee, the Black Trade Union Solidarity Movement and Black Media Workers' Association, the latter two funded by the Livingstone-led Greater London Council, were set up prior to Labour Party Black Sections. There were two main approaches to the formation of Labour Party Black Sections. For supporters of the organisation, the rationale for its existence was the fact that although for decades more than 80 per cent of Black people had voted Labour, this was not reflected in the party's policies, priorities, hierarchy or among its political representatives. Supporters argued Black Sections would act as a transmission belt to get more African, Caribbean and Asian people into Labour membership and actively involved in decision-making and representative roles in the party. Black Sections challenged the party's historical record of neglect of Black community concerns, including its passing in government of racist immigration laws. The Black Section's argument was, if its demands were agreed by Labour, the organisation would provide the party with the electoral support it needed in key inner city seats. By organising as a section (caucus) within the party, African Caribbean and Asian Labour Party members hoped to create a critical mass of Black people required to change the party so that it could take account of their aims of greater political representation and the adoption of their Black Agenda, brought out by the Black Sections in 1988. Responding to the growing weight of Black demands, and the creation of new opportunities to voice them, white progressive Labour Party members backed their Black fellow members to help them establish unofficial Black Sections. These were modelled on the party's already existing Women's Section and Young Socialists, and dozens of supportive Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs) sent motions backing Black Sections to the party's conference year after year, until the compromise Labour Party Black Socialist Society was agreed in 1990. Labour Party Black Sections were first mooted in 1981, after Britain's inner city uprisings, to further African Caribbean and Asian representation within the Labour Party. Among its founding members were Diane Abbott, then a councillor in Westminster, Paul Boateng, a left-wing lawyer and the only African Caribbean member of the Greater London Council, its first chair Russell Profitt, a Lewisham, south London, councillor, Billy Poh, a Vietnamese activist in Abbott's Westminster North, Paddington, west London, Constituency Labour Party (CLP), the office in which the Black Sections had its first base, and Marc Wadsworth, who became chair in 1985. Initially the party leader Neil Kinnock was said to have welcomed the idea, and in 1983, a composite motion (several CLPs had submitted Black Sections-supporting resolutions) setting out a framework for implementation by the National Executive Committee (NEC) was debated at party conference and then sent to the NEC for further consideration. After this, the NEC set up a \\"Positive Discrimination\\" working party to investigate the demand for Black Sections, which, recommended that they be made official, following its wide-ranging consultation among Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs), trade unions and socialist societies throughout the country, which favoured Black Sections, by a four to one majority. Positive discrimination were the preferred words of the influential left-wing Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, which had helped draft early Black Sections resolutions and circulated them among its extensive network of CLPs. Labour deputy leader Roy Hattersley, who was MP for the Birmingham Sparkbrook, UK, constituency with a large Asian party membership he feared would replace him if they were allowed to get organised, was bitterly against Black Sections. When Hattersley's left-wing CLP secretary Kevin Scally and Birmingham city councillor Amir Khan set up Sparkbrook Black Section, Hattersley had them expelled from Labour. But a vigorous national Black Sections campaign, fronted by Clare Short and supported by their Transport and General Workers Union, then Britain's largest trade union, got them reinstated by party conference, against the wishes of Kinnock and Hattersley. Despite powerful opposition from the Labour and trade union leaderships and a hostile news media, within a few years Black Sections had 35 branches, several of them in London, most sending \\"unofficial\\" delegates to their CLP party management and executive committees. On the back of the success of Black Sections, more than 200 African Caribbean and Asian Labour candidates were elected across the country in the 1986 council elections - a three-fold increase on their previous numbers. But, frustrated by the lack of a single Black MP in parliament, supporters around the country established an increasing number of Black Sections in CLPs and demanded change. This put pressure on the Labour leadership to tackle poor African Caribbean and Asian representation in the party and to focus its attention on policies that Black communities wanted. The Black Sections also called for \\"all-Black shortlists\\"- powered quotas to ensure Black MPs were selected as prospective candidates and then elected to parliament, the same as all-women shortlists, which the Black Sections was the first to advocate, were used to redress the gender representational imbalance. Campaigners lobbied for the party's constitution to be amended to ensure Black Sections had representation in the party's decision-making bodies at every level, including on the party's ruling National Executive Committee, as was already the case for the trade unions, women, youth and socialist societies, which included the Fabians and the Co-op Party. History In July 1984, the first national Black Sections conference was purposely held at Digbeth Hall, in Hattersley's Birmingham constituency. The MP was invited but refused the invitation. More than 300 mainly African Caribbean delegates attended. At the 1984 Labour Party autumn annual conference, 23 resolutions supporting Black Sections were tabled. At every national party conference between 1983 and 1989, Black Sections activists managed to get resolutions from CLPs all over Britain to amend Labour's constitution and advocate formally recognising Black Sections. But after it was agreed the first ones in 1983 should be remitted to the NEC without a vote, they were subsequently heavily defeated,after passionate debates, despite growing support from some large and medium-sized trade unions with their block votes in 1985, including, the National Union of Public Employees, the largest health workers' union and National Union of Miners. By 1986, more and more trade unions, under pressure from their Black members, agreed Black Sections had a positive effect in building up Black union membership. Indeed, some of them even set up their own Black structures. Many inner city CLPs had Black Sections, despite Labour's refusal to make them official: the Black Sections 1986 Annual Conference reported that more than 30 CLPs had unofficial Black Sections. In the face of fiece Labour opposition, Black Sections members operated as if their group was legitimate, often with the support of their CLPs and branches (wards). Consequently, the relationship between the Black Sections and the Labour leadership was marked by public conflict and constant tension that generated bad publicity for the party. Regardless, Black Sections achieved successes including, four of its Black supporters becoming London council leaders, Merle Amory (Brent), Linda Bellos (Lambeth), a Black Sections vice-chair, Bernie Grant (Haringey) and Dorman Long (Brent, after Amory), four Black MPs, and Bill Morris, as the first Black trade union general secretary. On top of that, Black self-organised groups were formed in trade unions and by probation officers, teachers and students and even by police officers, who formed the National Black Police Association (UK). The Trades Union Congress (TUC) created places on its general council and executive for Black representatives. Paul Boateng, Diane Abbott, Bernie Grant, Russell Profitt and Keith Vaz stopped acting as Black Sections activists when they were selected for safe or winnable seats in the 1980s. The 1987 general election bore the fruit of Black Sections' work in the form of the historic breakthrough of the four Black Labour MPs being elected (Boateng, Abbott, Grant and Keith Vaz) from 12 prospective Parliamentary candidates. Though Black Sections chair Sharon Atkin, a Lambeth, south London, councillor, was deselected as the Nottingham East prospective Labour parliamentary candidate the same year, at the insistence of Kinnock. Responding to an anti- Labour Black nationalist heckler, Bini Brown, Atkin had said, at a Black Sections public meeting in Birmingham, she would not want to represent \\"a Kinnock racist Labour party\\". Four Birmingham Labour MPs, led by Hattersley (the others were Robin Corbett, Terry Davis and Denis Howell), signed a letter, which they issued to the media, saying the meeting should not take place. It resulted in Bernie Grant not attending. The Black Sections issued a statement condemning the letter, stating there should be no apartheid-style Pass Laws, preventing the free movement of Black people, in the UK. Until 1988, the dominant position within the Black Sections was one of demanding no less than Labour constitutional recognition as an official section of the party, to achieve parity with the existing Women and Youth Sections. This shifted after the 1987 general election to one of the Black Sections being prepared to consider proposals from the Labour leadership if they met Black Sections' general Black self-organisation criteria. In 1988, Black Sections published the influential Black Agenda document after being urged by Race Today, Race and Class, of A. Sivanandan, and other radicals in African Caribbean and Asian communities, to state their policies. Although Black Sections were established in CLPs around the country, they were not endorsed by the Labour leadership. The legitimate calls for fair representation made by Black communities - whose electoral support was given overwhelmingly to Labour - were resisted by the party leadership of Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley, who wanted to defeat a rising left-wing rank and file the right-wing Conservative Party-supporting tabloid national newspapers denounced as the loony left . By 1987, Black Sections' founding principle of autonomous organisation within Labour was in doubt. In the face of the party's NEC backing a right-wing MP Gwyneth Dunwoody resolution, which threatened disciplinary action against future \\"separatist\\" activity, after the Black Sections arguably most successful conference, held in Nottingham, where its vice-chair Hassan Ahmed ran the largest Black Section outside London, the organisation was forced to go on the defensive. Six Black prospective parliamentary candidates, who were Black Sections members, agreed with Labour not to subscribe to \\"statements of Black Sections policy\\" (the Black Agenda), which were different from the general party programme. Clare Short, the left- wing Birmingham Ladywood MP, was one of the few white politicians to stand by Black Sections throughout its almost decade-long campaign. Despite the support for Black Sections, which, by then existed all over the labour movement, Labour still refused to recognise the organisation or and give it an official place in developing the party's race policies. In 1989, Martha Osamor, deputy leader of Haringey council in north London, and a Black Sections leader, was chosen as the prospective parliamentary candidate by the Vauxhall CLP in south London. Again, Kinnock stepped in to block the selection of a Black woman he considered to be too left-wing to represent the party in parliament. Kate Hoey was imposed as the candidate by the national party instead. Osamor's daughter Kate Osamor went on to become an MP years later, for Edmonton, north London, and Martha Osamor was made a House of Lords peer by her ally Jeremy Corbyn. In October 1990, at the Black Sections Annual General Meeting, Bernie Grant pointed out that the general political mood was one of retreat, the left was weak, and his view was the Black Sections' corresponding weakness meant it was time to be \\"pragmatic\\" and assess what would be achievable in such a climate. This stance, by one of its most prominent advocates, indicated that Black Sections was about to lower its horizons on the very existence of the organisation and the official recognition it would pursue. Some Black Sections activists suspected that Grant and his fellow prospective parliamentary candidates were now less keen to rock the Labour boat now they had got what they wanted and were about to become MPs. Despite this scepticism, the official demand for Black Sections was replaced by the organisation's leadership accepting the compromise of a hybrid Black Socialist Society because they believed their original demand was no longer feasible. In 1990, the view which gained ascendancy was that Black Sections should continue to operate as a pressure group under its current constitution, actively develop a Black Socialist Society within the Labour Party and seek to win political leadership of it. To end its longest-running internal dispute of the 1980s, Labour finally agreed to change the party's constitution to embrace the Black Socialist Society. During the 1990 conference a compromise was reached. Composite 8, as it was called, stated that the National Executive Committee would (a) recognise formally and support Black members' right to organise together for effective participation and representation; b) make provisions for the representation of Black members at all levels of the party; and c) adopt the working party's proposal on Black members' organisation within the party that were presented to the National Executive Committee on 16 July 1989, namely, the setting up of a single affiliated organisation for members of African, Caribbean, and Asian descent, with local and regional groups and direct representation on the National Executive Committee. The outcome of this resolution was the creation of the Black Socialist Society. In 1991, at the Black Sections' Annual General Meeting, it was acknowledged by national chair Mike Wongsam, summing up on behalf of the National Executive Committee, that enabling the Black Socialist Society would mean developing an organisation that would replace Labour Party Black Sections' influence within the Labour Party. Black Sections were disbanded and the Black Socialist Society was formed as a compromise between the party leadership and the organisation. This led to a split among Black Sections activists, with a minority rejecting a Black Socialist Society that they claimed would be half inside and half outside of the party, like the Labour head office-controlled National Organisation of Labour Students. The dissidents unsuccessfully urged the organisation stick to its demand for Black Sections, which would be inside the party, like the women and youth sections. Legacy Many of the Black Sections leaders remained Labour Party members. In 1991, they formed the grassroots Anti-Racist Alliance, which helped set up the groundbreaking Stephen Lawrence campaign for justice. In 1993, the Black Socialist Society was founded. Black Sections members joined to help set up local branches. The Black Socialist Society was supported by trade unions and Labour's Walworth Road headquarters, which ran its annual conferences. Key members of the first Black Socialist Society national committee were Black Sections members: Kingsley Abrams, Palma Black, Marc Wadsworth and Jatin Haria. An outcome of the Black Sections redefinition of autonomous organisation was to move Black politics from the periphery and into the heart of municipal and parliamentary politics. After the Black Socialist Society was defunct for more than a decade, because of the connivance with the antagonistic Labour headquarters of its trade union chair Gloria Mills, rewarded with a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) by the Queen of England, and treasurer Bob Purkiss, rewarded with an Member of the British Empire (MBE), the organisation was reconstituted into BAME Labour in 2007, after meetings Keith Vaz and Chuka Umunna MP had with the Labour leadership. This kept Vaz on Labour's NEC as its representative for more than a decade before he stepped down as an MP after being involved in a scandal. The enfeebled version of the already compromised Black Socialist Society quickly became moribund. Jeremy Corbyn's revitalised socialist Labour Party promised to return it to the Black Sections heyday but, consumed by much bigger challenges, never did. Grassroots Black Left was set up in Nottingham in 2017, by Black Sections veterans Hassan Ahmed and Marc Wadsworth, and had a parliamentary launch the following year attended by Labour MPs, including Clive Lewis, Naz Shah, Mohammad Yasin and Chris Williamson.

History After black socialist societies were defunct for over a decade, the Black Socialist Society was reconstituted into BAME Labour in 2007. The name was changed with Chuka Umunna, BAME Labour Executive Member at the time, writing that the rationale was that \\"‚Äúblack‚Äù is no longer used as a political term as widely as it once was\\" and that \\"different people have different understandings of the nature and meaning of ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù: some associate the word with notions of wholesale nationalization, a centrally controlled economy etc.; others more loosely associate the word with general notions of social justice and generally ‚Äúwhat a Labour government does‚Äù.\\". Since March 2007, Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East, has represented BAME Labour. Vaz is its directly elected representative on the Labour Party's ruling and governing National Executive Committee (NEC). Premise The mission statement of BAME Labour states that it \\"seeks to empower ethnic minority members within the Labour Party and campaigns for greater representation of ethnic minority communities in public life\\". Through encouraging increased participation in the political process BAME Labour empowers its members. It is a democratically constituted membership organisation which is affiliated to the Labour Party but is politically and organisationally independent. The organisation evolved, from Labour Party Black Sections to the Black Socialist Society to BAME Labour. Similar to Socialist Societies, it has an autonomous status, a separate constitution, joining fee, processes and admits people who are not Labour Party members. Whereas, like a Section, it is granted a fully independent NEC representative ‚Äì regardless of how low its membership drops ‚Äì and it is entirely administered by Labour Party staff. A ¬£5 fee provides members with a two-year membership. BAME Labour's elected officers including the Chair, Secretary and Treasurer are not allowed access to the membership data, finances or the running of the organisation's elections. This lies solely in the power of Labour Party staff. It holds a guaranteed place on Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) and three places on the party's National Policy Forum (NPF), matching and mirroring the NEC place and NPF representation shared by the other 15 socialist societies. Elections The Labour Party Rule Book states that: \\"The NEC shall comprise one member elected by the BAME Labour. This member to be elected once the individual membership of the socialist society has reached 2,500.\\" Candidates are required 20 supporting nominations from individual members, which must be collected in the form of paper-based signatures. Photocopied or scanned signatures are not allowed. Candidates who receive the support of a socialist society or trade union need fewer signatures, however, the same rules about how they are collected apply. In October 2010, BAME Labour had 3,363 members (the third largest affiliate, behind Fabian Society and Labour Students) and issued that many ballot papers in that year's leadership election. At the time, Labour Party membership was 177,559. The then-general secretary of the Fabian Society Sunder Katwala noted the low turnout in the BAME Labour election. The turnout amongst BAME Labour's membership was 11.7%. Out of 3363 ballots distributed, just 392 votes were cast, and of these 137 were spoilt ballots. Just 255 votes for leadership candidates were registered with David Miliband receiving 78% of the vote. In October 2012, the society was taken to the High Court over the question of whether Keith Vaz was eligible since it was alleged that court documents indicate that Vaz had not paid his annual subscription of ¬£1 to BAME Labour when he stood for re-election to the NEC in 2009. Vaz won the case despite a court case between Elcena Jeffers, the former secretary of BAME Labour, Labour officials successfully argued that Jeffers's failure to pay her annual subscription disqualified her from seeking re-election. In August 2017, despite the Labour Party membership being 570,000 with an estimated 72,000 black, Asian and minority ethnic members, membership of BAME Labour has fallen to 731 members of which 520 voted in the BAME Labour elections. This was in contravention of the 2,500 needed as per the stipulations of the Labour Party Rule Book. In August 2017, Vaz retained his place on the NEC on behalf of BAME Labour from challenger, Asghar Khan, a Leeds councillor, postal worker and trade union representative, who had the backing of several of the largest trade unions, including Unite the Union, GMB, Transport Salaried Staffs' Association and Communication Workers Union, and several videos in support of Khan's candidacy were made by Momentum. It was reported by the New Statesman that BAME Labour members \\"felt shut out by an archaic election process, which they say favoured an establishment within the society.\\" Labour Party Democracy Review In January 2018, for the first track of the Labour Party Democracy Review, Momentum proposed submissions to update the way the NEC's BAME representative is chosen, with a one member, one vote election replacing the current system where a small party group decides the post. Under the Momentum's proposals, all black or minority ethnic members of the party would automatically become part of BAME Labour and have one member, one voting rights in electing their NEC representative. BAME Labour would also have an independent organisation, with its committee having direct access to its own membership list and centrally-funded finances, and the ability to organise its own campaigns and events independently. In July 2018, for the third track of the Labour Party Democracy Review, proposals were submitted for reforming BAME Labour. The proposed changes would result in all Labour Party members who self-identify as ethnic minorities automatically becoming BAME Labour members, a national BAME committee being elected using one member, one vote and a higher percentage of reserved BAME seats in areas with high ethnic minority populations. Endorsements In October 2018, BAME Labour endorsed Vaughan Gething for the Welsh Labour Party leadership election.

Biography Fine's parents were both musicians; her mother played the flute and her father was a violist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She began taking violin lessons when she was 7 and switched to the flute at 14. After graduating high school, she moved from her hometown of Boston to New York to study at the Juilliard School. Fine graduated with a bachelor's of music in 1980 and moved to Graz, Austria to play with an orchestra. For a time she gave music lessons in the small town of Schladming but left when asked to play for the funerals of Nazi war veterans, which she could not reconcile with her Jewish heritage. She ended up in Vienna, playing music on the street for money. In 1981 a friend invited her to try out for an orchestra in Hong Kong but she failed her audition while taken ill and found a job as a school's substitute music teacher. Returning to Boston, Fine met Michael Leddy whom she married in 1984. One year later, they relocated to Charleston, Illinois, where he had been hired as an English professor at Eastern Illinois University. Fine found there was a vibrant artistic community in the small collegiate town. She worked at the university's radio station, WEIU, from 1987 to 2000 as the classical music director. She played music on the late morning shift and also engaged in fundraising and instructed student operators. Fine made a career in music performance and instruction, and volunteered for benefit concerts and free public concerts to ensure music was accessible to the community. For two years she served as president of the Coles County Arts Council which she helped attain nonprofit status, and in 2004 founded the Summer Strings program which created opportunities for unaffiliated musicians to play together in an orchestra setting. Finding that there were more opportunities for string instruments in orchestras, Fine switched to the viola and violin and performed with the LeVeck String Quartet from 1994 to 2005. After Thomas Leveck left the group in 2005, she stayed with the remaining members, performing as the Downstate Strings. During this time Fine began composing music, using her experience with string and wind instruments. She has made her works available in the public domain to help other musicians. Fine has written over 70 pieces of chamber music, 3 operas, and arranges music for the International Music Company in New York. She has also written columns, reviews and biographies for magazines American Record Guide and Maud Powell Signature. Fine received awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) each year from 2003 to 2008. In 2014 Fine received a Jefferson Award in recognition of her service to the community.

Appearances =Season 8= In the episode \\"The Damned\\", while in a battle, Alden is one of the Saviors attempting to flee the Satellite Outpost, but is forced to surrender to the Militia remarking that \\"living sounds good\\" after being surrounded. He encourages his fellow Saviors to surrender as well. He is chained with several other Saviors in the episode \\"Monsters\\" and being transported to the Hilltop Colony. On their way a walker attack occurred. His fellow Saviors who are chained together with him attempt to flee in the panic, but he refuses and reminds them that the Militia has guns handy they don't. After successfully being brought to the Hilltop in the episode \\"The King, the Widow, and Rick\\", he asks Jesus what the colonists of the Hilltop are building inside. He is then imprisoned with the other Saviors and Gregory. He then stops Jared, a Savior who has tried to flee several times before, from escaping because he doesn't want any trouble. In the mid-season finale, \\"How It's Gotta Be\\", he begs to Maggie that she would spare Dean, a fellow inmate. Shortly after, Alden, in horror, witnesses Maggie execute Dean in cold blood. In the episode \\"Dead or Alive Or\\", he suggests an agreement to Maggie that the prisoners be allowed to alternately go out supervised for a short period of time. At first she refuses, but eventually agrees. In the episode \\"Do Not Send Us Astray\\", Maggie threatens to kill all of the prisoners if Simon, the de facto leader of the Saviors, doesn't stop an attack on Hilltop. However Simon starts the attack without thinking about the welfare of the prisoners. Alden asks if he can help, but Maggie sends him back to the others inside. After the battle Alden buries the corpses of the fallen Saviors, stating that he doesn't think about them as his people anymore. On the following night, Henry arrives at the prison and threatens to kill all of the prisoners if the murderer of his brother doesn't show himself. Alden tries to talk Henry down and reveals that he also had a brother who has been killed, explaining through his own experiences that revenge won't help him. While they're talking, a wounded prisoner reanimates and kills two others, making Henry open the gate. In the panic, Jared is able to overpower Henry and escapes with some of the prisoners. Alden and several other prisoners however stay and try to close the main gate against a walker herd drawn by the gunfire. Alden then saves Siddiq from a walker, killing it with a shovel. Maggie and others arrive and hold Alden at gunpoint, asking him what happened. Alden explains that he and the other remaining prisoners don't know where the escapees went, but that they will stay and help despite the fact that they no longer have any strategic value to the Militia. Maggie appears to accept Alden's explanation. Following the attack, Alden and the other former Savior prisoners are set free though they are not fully trusted and are not allowed to join the Militia. In \\"Still Gotta Mean Something,\\" Rick approaches Alden for anything he knows about where the escaped prisoners may have gone. Alden suggests an old dive bar located between the Hilltop and the Sanctuary that Alden once scouted out for the Saviors as a potential outpost. Alden asks Rick to only kill who he needs to kill and to give the other Saviors, who Alden believes are just scared, a chance to join up with them as Alden's group did. When Rick returns with Morgan, Alden is sitting by the fire with Dianne and realizes that Rick killed all of the Saviors despite Alden's request. In \\"Wrath,\\" Alden and the other defected Savior prisoners volunteer for a mission to lead the walker herd that was drawn by the battle in \\"Do Not Send Us Astray\\" away from the Hilltop, an offer that is accepted. After they return, Alden is briefly accosted by Morgan Jones who was unaware of his mission. During the evacuation of the Hilltop, Alden chooses to stay behind with Tara to face the attacking Saviors with Tara alongside the other defectors, making it clear that even if Tara isn't with them, they are with her. Tara agrees to arm the defectors, but Aaron shows up with the women of Oceanside to firebomb the Savior attackers before a battle can break out. After the war is over, Alden approaches Maggie to ask her to remain at the Hilltop despite the other Savior defectors returning to the Sanctuary. Having read Georgie's book A Key to the Future, Alden suggests that he can put his talents to better use making the book a reality and he has never truly felt at home in the Sanctuary. After a brief contemplation, Maggie agrees to allow Alden to join the Hilltop Colony. =Season 9= In \\"A New Beginning,\\" Alden travels with the group to the Museum to gather supplies; and talks with Ken and Marco on the way back. After Ken's sudden death, Alden sings at his funeral. When Maggie decides to hang Gregory, Alden watches in discomfort along with the others. In \\"The Bridge\\", Alden comes to Rick to warn him that the Saviors are going to turn against him if he keeps going on the way he is, even comparing Rick's actions to that of Negan's. In \\"Warning Signs\\" Alden is present when The Saviors are causing an uproar and directly confronts Jed when trying to calm the situation. \\"In \\"The Obliged,\\" Jed reveals that he ambushed Alden and stole his gun, leaving Alden's ultimate fate unknown. Though he does not appear, Alden is mentioned in \\"Stradivarius\\" where he is revealed to be alive and one of the Hilltop's construction foremen six years after Rick Grimes' apparent death. Alden reappears in \\"Evolution\\" where he is shown working as a blacksmith alongside Earl Sutton and to be in a relationship with Carl's old girlfriend Enid. In \\"Adaptation\\", Alden and Luke go looking for Daryl and company because they take a long time to return, along the way they both talk about what they like, they stop talking when they see an arrow in a tree. Luke gets off his horse and pulls the arrow out of the tree but a walker attacks him, luckily Alden saves Luke from certain death, killing the walker. A while later they both walk through the forest and are surrounded by walkers (who are actually whisperers, people who dress up as walkers), the Alpha leader shoots an arrow at the ground and then points a shotgun at them and says \\"Here the trail ends, \\"ending the episode. In \\"Bounty\\" Alpha arrives at Hilltop and offers them an exchange, Alden and Luke for their daughter. Alpha orders to leave a baby at the mercy of the walkers, because it attracts the walkers, Alden tells him that he cannot do that and Alpha tells him that to live with the dead you have to be quiet like them. Henry takes Lydia but fortunately Lydia returns voluntarily because otherwise Alpha will kill them. The exchange is successful and Alden hugs Enid, she tells him that \\"he will never let her out again\\" and he replies \\"That won't happen\\", at night Alden and Enid sleep together in their room. Alden is mentioned in \\"Chokepoint\\" by Tara, who says she has to clear the roads for Alden's convoy to pass safely. In \\"The Calm Before\\", Alden goes to the community fair and participates in fair events. Alden is walking with Enid and Luke and the latter tells him to sing with him on stage.

In \\"Silence the Whisperers\\", Alden is alerted when he hears a tree fall on Hilltop causing 9 injuries and the destruction of part of the Hilltop wall. The group debates whether they believe the whisperers are responsible, Alden believes that they are, since previously the whisperers crossed the border of the communities to hunt. Then help the wounded trapped in the rubble. The following night because part of the wall is destroyed, the walkers enter the community, Alden and the other residents kill the incoming walkers with the help of the last minute Alexandria convoy.

The average height of a mature plant is 50‚Äì70 cm, but it sometimes ranges up to 100 cm. The small flowers begin white but quickly turn to brown. The leaves, which are attached directly to the stem, are approximately 2.5‚Äì4 cm x 0.3-0.5 cm, linear, and taper to a blunt apex. Small, highly branched hairs cover the leaves and flowering portions of the plant, leading to its sticky texture. The peduncles are approximately 5‚Äì10 cm, unbranched, and covered in similar highly branched hairs. Also covered in these hairs are the bracts, which are fertile and greenish-white with a rounded apex and a narrow base. The calyx is approximately 0.8‚Äì1 cm long with four triangular lobes. The corolla is tubular with a wider superior portion, and it is usually about 1.5 times the size of the calyx. The pollen of L. viridis is orange.  Ecology  Lavandula viridis is often found growing in dry conditions and nutrient poor soils, needing very little water to grow. Thriving in warm climates, it is able to grow well in parts of Australia, New Zealand, and southern United States of America. It can also be found in coastal regions of the Mediterranean at fairly low altitudes. The white color of the flowers are used to attract night-flying insect pollinators such as moths, while the plant's strong, lemon-like scent helps attract bees during the day.  Uses  Lavandula viridis has been utilized for medicinal purposes due to the high concentration of essential oils present in its tissue. One study identified fifty-one essential oil compounds in this species, and they were most commonly found in the actively growing shoots. The oils have a large proportion of oxygen-containing monoterpenes, followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons. Among the fifty-one compounds, 1,8-cineole, camphor, alpha-pinene, and linalool had the highest percentages, respectively. Upon experimentation, these oils were found to exhibit antifungal activity against yeasts and filamentous fungi, specifically strains of Candida, Aspergillus, Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Cryptococcus. Of these strains, L. viridis was most active against Cryptococcus, then Candida, and was least effective against Aspergillus strains.  Taxonomy  Lavandula viridis falls under the Order Lamiales because it is included in the category of flowers that have a superior ovary, two fused carpals, four fused petals, and four or less fertile stamens, while showing bilateral symmetry. L. viridis is a member of the Family Lamiaceae due to its aromatic tissue, square stems, and tubular flowers. Like the rest of the plants in the Genus Lavandula, they also are characterized by entire leaves, a unique aroma, herbal uses, and the appearance of flowers.

The only known specimen of Cruralispennia was discovered in the Early Cretaceous Huajiying Formation of China and formally described in 2017. The type species of Cruralispennia is Cruralispennia multidonta. The generic name is Latin for \\"shin feather\\", while the specific name means \\"many-toothed\\".The holotype of Cruralispennia is IVPP 21711, a semi-articulated partial skeleton surrounded by the remains of carbonized feathers. Cruralispennia lived alongside several other species of enantiornitheans, such as Protopteryx, in the Sichakou Basin of the Huajiying Formation, approximately 130.7 million years ago. Despite being one of the earliest known ornithothoraces, this genus possessed several features of derived enantiornitheans as well as some unusual traits convergent with ornithuromorphs, a group containing modern birds. Cruralispennia are also notable for having crural feathers originally described as possessing a unique form unknown in any other feathered animal. However, it has also been hypothesized that the holotype specimen had recently molted, and that the unusual feathers were simply new feathers which had yet to lose the thick sheath around the rachis.  Description  Life reconstruction of Cruralispennia = Skull and vertebrae = Although most of the skull is poorly preserved, several elements are identifiable. The premaxilla is short and tall, while the rear part of the frontal is domed. The left dentary preserves fourteen teeth, a characteristically high number compared to other enantiornitheans. Although none of the teeth preserve complete crowns, there is a visible trend of the teeth becoming more buccolingually (side-to-side) flattened towards the back of the jaw. The spine is incomplete, but several articulated thoracic vertebrae preserve a lateral groove, characteristic of enantiornitheans. The fused pygostyle of IVPP 21711 is characteristically short and broad, tapering distally into an upturned tip. This is entirely unlike the long rod- or spear-like pygostyles known in other enantiornitheans, as well confuciusornithids and sapeornithids. Instead, its pygostyle is most similar to the plow-shaped pygostyles of ornithuromorphs. In modern birds, this form of pygostyle attaches to tail muscles which control the advanced pennaceous rectrices of their fan-shaped tails. However, its presence in IVPP 21711, which has simple, hair-like tail feathers, throws doubt on the hypothesis that a plow-shaped pygostyle always correlates to an advanced, fan- shaped tail. = Forelimbs = Each coracoid of IVPP 21711 is slender, similar to those of advanced enantiornitheans. The thinnest part of the coracoid is the third which is furthest away from the sternum, while the widest is the half nearest the sternum. However, the edges of the coracoid are almost parallel near the sternum, unlike the coracoids of other enantiornitheans, which drastically splay outwards near the sternum, forming concave outer margins. The front of sternum has a pointed rostral spine, which is known in a few other enantiornitheans. The rear edge of the sternum has two pairs of thin rod-like structures. Although these structures are known in all but the most basal enantiornitheans, only IVPP 21711 has the inner pair extend the same distance as the outer pair. On the other hand, the V-shaped xiphoid region is similar to basal enantiornitheans such as Protopteryx and pengornithids. The forelimb is rather short, with a robust humerus possessing enantiornithean features. The hand is shorter than the humerus and the alular digit is reduced, both features characteristic of advanced enantiornitheans. = Hind limbs = The postacetabular process of the ilium is characteristically short and tapering, and extends further downward than the ischiadic peduncle. The ischium is shorter than the pubis and has an upward pointing process midway down the shaft, similar to that of basal ornithuromorphs. There is no pubic foot, as in enantiornitheans. The tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus are long and slender, but the fibula is short and tapering (as in advanced enantiornitheans and ornithuromorphs). The toe claws are sharp and curved. = Feathers = Well-preserved feathers surround every part of the skeleton except the snout and feet. The body and tail feathers are short, hair-like, and do not have rachises. The feathers on the upper side of the neck are longer than those on the lower side. Asymmetrical pennaceous feathers are preserved attached to the wings, although they are shorter than in other enantiornitheans, being only twice the length of the hand. The most characteristic features of IVPP 21711, which the genus Cruralispennia was named after, are its crural (leg) feathers. These feathers are present on the tibiotarsus and possibly the femur, although overlap from body feathers makes the femur's integument uncertain. They are long and wire-like, consisting of a rachis-like structure seemingly formed from the fusion of a bundle of parallel barbs. This rachis-like structure forms 90% of the length of the feather. In the distal 10% of the feather's length, the individual parallel barbs become distinguishable, forming a brush- like tip. This form of feather morphology, dubbed \\"proximally wire-like part with a short filamentous distal tip (PWFDT)\\" , is also present in feathers projecting along the front edge of the left wing. PWFDT feathers are currently only known in Cruralispennia, although they are similar to the ribbon-like tail feathers of the oviraptorosaur Similicaudipteryx. It is probable that PWFDT feathers are a result of a genetic overexpression of the BMP4 gene (which promotes barb fusion and rachis formation) or a suppression of the Sonic hedgehog gene (which promotes the formation of individual barbs). Another possibility is that the PWFDT feathers are not a novel type of feather unique to Cruralispennia, but instead are immature pennaceous feathers formed after a recent molt. There are several lines of reasoning supporting this hypothesis. With a long, thick rachis and minimal barbs at the tip, the PWFDT feathers resemble moderately developed pin feathers, which are known from modern birds as well as newly described juvenile enantiornitheans. In addition, they are interspersed with mature feathers, while truly unique feather types are expected to be separated from typical feathers. Many of the specimen's feathers are loosely attached or separated from the rest of the specimen, adding further evidence to the hypothesis that it was molting when it died. = Color = Structures believed to be fossilized melanosomes were found in five feather samples from the specimen using scanning electron microscopy. Due to their rod-like shape, they were identified as eumelanosomes, which correspond to dark shades. Although specific colors were not stated in the analysis, other studies have shown that coloration in extant birds correlates to the length and aspect ratio (length to width ratio) of their eumelanosomes. A sample taken from the crural feathers had eumelanosomes with the shortest aspect ratio, which may have corresponded to dark brown coloration. The highest aspect ratio eumelanosomes were found in a sample from the head feathers. High aspect ratios have been known to correlate with glossy or iridescent colors, although without knowing the structure of a feather's keratin layer (which does not fossilize well), no hue can be assigned for certain. The wing and tail samples also had high aspect ratios, while the tail's eumelanosomes were the largest sampled.  Classification  Cruralispennia was referred to Enantiornithes in the taxon's description due to various features of the humerus, a lack of procoracoid processes, and a long acromion process of the scapula. A phylogenetic analysis recovered Cruralispennia as a moderately advanced enantiornithean, more derived than basal members of the clade such as Protopteryx and pengornithids. Some of the derived features present within Cruralispennia include a reduced fibula and a short hand. However, the presence of a short, plow-shaped pygostyle in IVPP 21711 shows that Cruralispennia had some derived features which were very different from other enantiornitheans. Cruralispennia seemingly belongs to a previously undiscovered ancient lineage of enantiornitheans which had convergently evolved many ornithuromorph-like features. In addition, the presence of such a derived genus so early in the Cretaceous is evidence that the family tree of ornithothoraces is older than currently known fossils suggest.  Paleobiology  A histological study of IVPP 21711's humerus found no lines of arrested growth present within the bone. This is evidence that IVPP 21711 died within one season. However, due to the bone having both an inner and outer layer, IVPP 21711 was believed to have died near adulthood. These factors are support for the idea that individuals of Cruralispennia grew quickly, reaching adult size in less than a year. This is in contrast with other enantiornitheans, which are believed to have grown slowly, taking several years to reach adulthood. Cruralispennia's growth strategies were more similar to those of Confusciusornis and ornithuromorphs, although slightly slower. It is difficult to determine the function of the crural PWFDT feathers (if they are unique in the first place), but several possibilities have been put forth. Some of these possible functions include insulation, heat shielding, or social signalling. Although PWFDT feathers were probably too simple to provide any aerodynamic advantage, their narrowness means that they were unlikely to have been an inhibiting factor either.

Games as a service are ways to monetize video games either after their initial sale, or to support a free-to-play model. Games released under the GaaS model typically receive a long or indefinite stream of monetized new content over time to encourage players to continue paying to support the game. This often leads to games that work under a GaaS model to be called \\"living games\\" or \\"live games\\", since they continually change with these updates.  History and forms  The idea of games as a service began with the introduction of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) like World of Warcraft, where the game's subscription model approach assured continued revenues to the developer and publisher to create new content. Over time, new forms of offering continued GaaS revenues have come about. A significant impact on the use of GaaS was the expansion of mobile gaming which often include a social element, such as playing or competing with friends, and with players wanting to buy into GaaS to continue to play with friends. Chinese publisher Tencent was one of the first companies to jump onto this around 2007 and 2008, establishing several different ways to monetize their products as a service to Chinese players, and since has become the world's largest video game publisher in terms of revenue. Another influential game establishing games as a service was Team Fortress 2. To fight against a shrinking player- base, Valve released the first of several free updates in 2008, the \\"Gold Rush Update\\" which featured new weapons and cosmetic skins that could be unlocked through in-game achievements. Further updates added similar weapons which starting include monetization options, such as buying virtual keys to open in- game loot boxes. Valve began earning enough from these revenues to transition Team Fortress 2 to a free-to-play title. Valve carried this principle over to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and to Dota 2, the latter which was in competition with League of Legends by Riot Games. League of Legends which had already had a microtransaction model in place, established a constant push of new content on a more frequent basis (in this case, the release of a new hero each week for several years straight) to compete, creating the concept of lifestyle games such as Destiny and Tom Clancy's The Division. Some examples include: ;Game subscriptions :Many massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) use monthly subscription models. Revenue from these subscriptions pay for the computer servers used to run the game, the people that manage and oversee the game on a daily basis, and the introduction of new content into the game. Several MMOs offer an initial trial period that allow players to try the game for a limited amount of time, or until their character reaches an experience level cap, after which they are required to pay to continue to play. ;Game subscription services :Subscription services like EA Access and Xbox Game Pass grant subscribers complete access to a large library of games offered digitally with no limitations. User need to download these games to their local computer or console to play. However, users must remain subscribed to play these games; the games are protected by digital rights management that requires an active account to play. New games are typically added to the service, and in some cases, games may leave the service, after which subscribers will be unable to play that title. Such services may offer the ability to purchase these titles to own and allow them to play outside of the subscription service. ;Cloud gaming / gaming on demand :Services like PlayStation Now, Stadia or GameFly allow players to play games that are run on remote servers on local devices, eliminating the need for specialized console hardware or powerful personal computers, outside of the necessary bandwidth for Internet connectivity. These otherwise operate similar to game services, in that the library of available titles may be added to or removed from over time, depending on the service. ;Microtransactions :Microtransactions represent low-cost purchases, compared to the cost of a full game or a large expansion pack, that provide some form of additional content to the purchaser. The type of content can vary from additional downloadable content; new maps and levels for multiplayer games; new items, weapons, vehicles, clothing, or other gear for the player's character; power-ups and temporary buffs; in-game currency, and elements like loot boxes that provide a random assortment of items and rewards. Players do not necessarily need to purchase these items with real-world funds to acquire them. However, a game's design and financial approach that aims to provide ongoing service is aimed to assure that a small fraction of players will purchase this content immediately rather than grinding through the game for a long time to obtain it. These select \\"whales\\" providing sufficient revenue to support further development of new content. This approach is generally how free-to-play games like Puzzle & Dragons, Candy Crush Saga, and League of Legends support their ongoing development, as well as used atop full-priced games like Grand Theft Auto Online. ;Season passes :Games with season passes provide one or more large content updates over the course of about a year, or a \\"season\\" in these terms. Players must buy into a season pass to access this new content; the game remains playable if players do not purchase the season pass and do gain benefit of core improvements to the game, but they are unable to access new maps, weapons, quests, game modes, or other gameplay elements without this content. Games like Destiny and its sequel and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege use this season pass approach. A related concept is the battle pass which provides new customization options that a player can earn by completing challenges in a game, but only if they have bought into the battle pass. Battle passes can be seen in games such as Dota 2, Rocket League, and Fortnite Battle Royale. Games may combine one or more of these forms. A common example are lifestyle games, which provide rotating daily content, which frequently reward the player with in-game currency to buy new equipment (otherwise purchasable with real-world funds), and extended by updates to the overall game. Examples of such lifestyle games include Destiny and many MMORPG like World of Warcraft. Rationale The principal reason that many developers and publishers have adopted GaaS is financial, giving them the ability to capture more revenue from the market than with a single release title (otherwise known as \\"games as a product\\"). While not all players will be willing to spend additional money to gain new content, there can be enough demand from a smaller population of players to support the service model. GaaS further represents a means by which games can improve their reputation to critics and players by continued improvements over time, using revenues earned from GaaS monetization to support the continued development and to draw in new sales for the product. Titles like Diablo III and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege are examples of games offering GaaS which initially launched with lukewarm reception but have been improved with continued service improvements. While the games as a service model is aimed to extend revenues, the model also aimed to eliminate legal issues related to software licenses, specifically the concept of software ownership versus license. Case law for video games remains unclear whether retail and physical game products qualify as goods or services. If treated as goods, the purchaser gains several rights, in particular those related to the first-sale doctrine which allows them to resell or trade these games, which can subsequently affect sales revenue to publishers. The industry has generally considered that physical games are a service, enforced through End-user license agreements (EULA)s to try to limit post-sale activities, but these have generally not been enforceable since they affect consumers' rights, leading to confusion in the area. Instead, by transitioning to games as a service, where there is a clear service being offered, publishers and developers can clearly establish their works as services rather than goods. This further gives publishers more control over the use of the software and what actions users can do through an enforceable EULA, such as preventing class action lawsuits. GaaS can reduce unauthorized copying. Also, certain games can be hosted in a cloud server, eliminating the need for installation in players' computers and consoles. Impact Industry analysis firm Digital River estimated that by 2016, 25% of the revenue of games on personal computers results from one form or another of GaaS. The firm argued that this reflects on consumers that want more out of games that are otherwise offered at full price ( at the time of the report) or will look for discounts, thus making the market ripe for post-release monetization. Several major publishers, including Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Electronic Arts have identified GaaS as a significant focus of their product lines in 2017, while others like Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive recognize the importance of post-release support of a game to their financial bottom lines. GaaS is also seen as a developing avenue for indie video games, which frequently have a wider potential install base (across computer, consoles, and mobile devices) that they can draw service revenues from. A study by DFC Intelligence in 2018 found Electronic Arts' value rose from to $33 billion since 2012, while Activision Blizzard saw its value rise from $20 billion to $60 billion in the same period, with both increases attributed in part to the use of the GaaS model in their games catalog. Electronic Arts had earned $2 billion from GaaS transactions in 2018.

She is the author of Ordinary Girls, which received a Whiting Award in Nonfiction, a Florida Book Awards Gold Medal, was a Lambda Literary Award Finalist, and a Barnes & Noble Discover Prize Finalist. Her work has appeared in The Best American Essays, Tin House, The Sun, The Fader, Rolling Stone, The Guardian, Longreads, and other places. She is an editor at the Kenyon Review and a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. As of 2019, she lives and works in Miami Beach, Florida with her partner, writer Lars Horn. Early life Jaquira D√≠az was born in Puerto Rico into a family that lived in the Puerto Rican housing projects, colloquially referred to as el caser√≠o. The neighborhood was made up of government housing, and had something of a dangerous reputation. D√≠az, in an interview she gave to Origins, tells stories of being menaced by a machete-armed man, and of raids by the local Police force, referred to as los camarones. When she was older, her family moved to Miami. Growing up in Miami Beach during what she describes as the city's \\"urban blight,\\" she had a difficult life, marked by drug use, attempts at suicide, and encounters with the law. D√≠az contributes some of her identity issues to being what she describes as \\"a closeted queer girl\\" in a neighborhood where gay people were harassed and attacked. Another issue was the family's financial situation. Her father, who had studied at the University of Puerto Rico and whom she describes as a lover of poetry and literature, became a drug dealer in order to support the family. As she grew older, writing continued to be an important outlet for her, and her writing developed a semi-autobiographical character, often dealing with suicide, drug use, and identity. Career D√≠az's fiction and essays, which are predominantly set in Puerto Rico and Miami, have been described as \\"lyrical\\" and \\"urgent\\" and are often focused on the intensely personal tragedies and triumphs of young women maturing in a dangerous world. In addition to her literary writing, D√≠az writes about crime, politics, sexuality, race, music, and culture, and has been described as an elegant prose stylist. In 2017, Los Angeles Times critic Walton Muyumba listed D√≠az as \\"part of a necessary cipher of extremely gifted freestylers\\" that includes writers Ta-Nehisi Coates, Isabel Wilkerson, Carol Anderson, Claudia Rankine, Terrance Hayes, Kiese Laymon, Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, Junot D√≠az, and Jelani Cobb, and she was listed among Remezcla's \\"15 Latinx Music Journalists You Should be Reading\\" and was included in NPR's Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs of 2017, as one of \\"the cream of the crop of Latinx music writers.\\" In 2018, Electric Literature's Ivelisse Rodriguez named her among the writers who \\"are changing the topography of Puerto Rican literature,\\" describing D√≠az's essays as being \\"about the awakening of sexual desire and the sexual threat all women experience.\\" D√≠az holds a B.A. from the University of Central Florida and an M.F.A. from the University of South Florida, and has been the recipient of fellowships from The Kenyon Review, the Wisconsin Institute for Creative Writing at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, the Ragdale Foundation, the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, The MacDowell Colony, the Tin House Summer Writers' Workshop, the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, and the Sewanee Writers' Conference, as well as an NEA Distinguished Fellowship from the Hambidge Center for the Creative Arts and Sciences. In May 2018, D√≠az announced that she had signed a two-book deal with Algonquin Books; the first book, Ordinary Girls, a memoir, will be published by Algonquin on October 29, 2019, and will explore themes of girlhood in a dangerous world, and coming of age in the projects of Puerto Rico and the streets of Miami.

Eventually she became CORE's Southern regional director. Hamilton v. Alabama (1964) After being arrested in Lebanon, Tennessee, a mayor who visited her addressed her as Mary, without the honorific \\"Miss\\" or \\"Mrs.\\", which were then frequently denied to African-Americans, but she corrected him: \\"if you don't know how to speak to a lady...then get out of my cell.\\" Things came to a head when she was one of many civil rights protesters arrested in 1963 in Gadsden, Alabama, and during cross examination at a habeas corpus hearing by the prosecutor in the Etowah County courthouse she refused to answer unless he stopped addressing her as \\"Mary\\", demanding she be called \\"Miss Hamilton\\". Supported by her lawyer and enduring what she later reported were lewd comments directed at her by Judge Cunningham, she was fined $50 for contempt of court and, when she refused to pay, spent five days in jail. An appeal was filed on grounds that she was denied her constitutional rights since she did not receive the same treatment as white witnesses. It was denied by the Alabama Supreme Court and ended up before the United States Supreme Court, which in April 1964 unanimously overruled the lower court without hearing oral arguments. The case made national headlines and landed Hamilton on the cover of Jet magazine, but left her tired and in ill health. Later life and death In 1964 Hamilton left CORE to marry Walter Young, a dentist, and returned to her hometown in Denver, Colorado. That marriage ended in divorce, as did her subsequent marriage to Harold Wesley. She subsequently worked as a union organizer for 1199, the Drug & Hospital Workers, and an educator in New York, earning an MAT from Manhattanville College in 1971 and going on to teach English at Sleepy Hollow High School until she retired in 1990. Mary Hamilton died on November 13, 2002 after a seven-year battle against 4th-stage ovarian cancer.

Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) football with the McMaster Marauders from 2012 to 2015. He is a Grey Cup champion with the Argonauts and a Yates Cup champion with the Marauders.  Professional career  Cross was drafted in the fourth round, 27th overall, by the Toronto Argonauts in the 2016 CFL Draft and signed with the team on May 19, 2016. He made the active roster after the conclusion of training camp and dressed for all 18 games of the 2016 Toronto Argonauts season. He made his first career reception in the Labour Day Classic against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on September 5, 2016. Following the hiring of Marc Trestman as head coach for the 2017 season, Cross gained a more prominent role in the offense. He scored his first career touchdown on July 24, 2017 on a three-yard pass from Ricky Ray in a game against the Ottawa Redblacks. For the regular season, he recorded 36 catches for 366 yards and five touchdowns. He won his first Grey Cup championship in the 105th Grey Cup game where he had five catches for 36 yards and a pair of two-point conversion scores. During the following off-season, on December 21, 2017, he signed a contract extension with the Argonauts through to the 2020 CFL season. Cross played in all 18 games for a third consecutive season, and produced three rushes for 10 yards, and 30 catches for 242 yards and two touchdowns. For 2019, Cross missed six games with injury, and as a receiver, was largely ignored in the scheme implemented by new offensive coordinator Jacques Chapdelaine; he had only nine catches during his 12 games, after logging at least 30 the previous two years. Cross did continue to excel as a blocker, and on only two carries set a new career high for rushing yards, with 11. Furthermore, as a fourth year player, he developed into a locker room leader for the embattled team, which finished with a 4-14 record for the second consecutive year. During the following off- season, on March 4, 2020, Cross signed a contract extension through to the 2023 season.

The Queensland Department of Justice and Attorney-General's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) conducted a 13-month probe that resulted in a $20 thousand settlement to pay back 29 customers, while Queensland's Office of Industrial Relations (OIR) levied another fine and reached a separate agreement to pay back the remaining customers. History The Global Work & Travel Co. was founded in 2008 by father and son duo Pierre and J√ºrgen Himmelmann. They and J√ºrgen's mother Caryl Himmelmann own the company. Based in Surfers Paradise, Queensland, it has offices in three cities: Surfers Paradise, Queensland, Vancouver, and London. The Global Work & Travel Co. offers working holiday, au pair, internship, volunteer and teaching abroad packages for people between the ages of 18 and 35. It helps travellers with flights, travel visas, and travel insurance. It provides services primarily in five countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Trips can last up to 24 months, depending on arrival countries visa specifications. In 2015, it had 100 employees and served over 20,000 travellers, by 2018 it had served over 40,000. Criticism and controversy In November 2014, the company was investigated jointly by CBC News and Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which found several dozen accusations from consumers who travelled internationally and were unable to find employment. The travellers described The Global Work & Travel Co.'s high-pressure sales techniques, misleading job pledges, and massive markups. The Global Work & Travel Co. settled with OFT after a 13-month probe. The company agreed to refund over $20,000 to 29 customers. In February 2015, the Federal Circuit Court of Australia fined The Global Work & Travel Co. and its owners $138,000 for not refunding a prior agreed upon sum to six workers they had misclassified as independent contractors. The Global Work & Travel Co. also was investigated by the Queensland's Office of Industrial Relations (OIR). OIR levied a fine on the company in February 2016 for violations of the Private Employment Agents Act of 2005. The company settled with OIR in March 2016 to have all charges resolved after repayment of all fines.

Mexican bromeliad weevil, Metamasius callizona. Featured Creatures EENY-161. Females lay elongated eggs that are roughly 2 mm long and 1 mm wide, which change colour from white, to yellow, to light brown with time after being laid. = Life cycle = M. callizona are multivoltine, holometabolous insects with 5 larval instars, on average taking roughly 58 days to progress from egg to adult.Salas, J., Frank, J.H. (2001). Development of Metamasius callizona (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on pineapple stems. Florida Entomologist 84: 123-126 All life stages of M. callizona can be found on an individual host plant, where adult females chew slices in leaves near optimal feeding sites and proceed to lay individual eggs within the fresh slices. = Feeding = Adult M. callizona beetles eat the leaves of host bromeliads, which is usually not fatal to the host plant; however, larval life stages mine the tissue of the plant stems and often lead to plant death. Weevils are limited in their ability to survive on a host by its size. Any given bromeliad must be large enough to support at least one individual or it will likely go un-infected. In their native range, M. callizona specialize on bromeliads in the genus Tillandsia.  Invaded Area  As an invasive species, M. callizona has decimated the populations of several bromeliad species in Florida, where it has established an invaded range in southern and central Florida, to a straight-line boundary in the north between the Western Hillsborough County, and the Eastern Volusia County. The first specimen arrived in Florida on the decorative Tillandsia ionantha bromeliad from Mexico, on which adults feed but do not lay eggs. They have since expanded feeding sources to include several different genera. Spread of the weevil was facilitated by the transport and propagation of infected bromeliads between Florida counties, primarily in the gardening industry. 12 of 16 Florida bromeliad species are susceptible to M. callizona attack, and the other 4 are generally safe because of their small size. M. callizona is a significant concern for T. utriculata which are directly killed, even by adult beetles.  Management and Control  = Prevention = As it goes with most invasive species, prevention of spread is the most effective way to minimize the effects that invaders have on native species. Chemical dips on imported bromeliads have been suggested to kill off any stow-away insects, as well as restricting imports to allow only seeds by banning host species from being brought into Florida. Unfortunately, prevention is no longer an option for many Florida counties that already have established M. callizona populations. Areas that are already invaded must choose from a variety of other control options. = Chemical Control = Insecticides that target adult and larval life stages have been proposed and implemented in bromeliad nurseries and other gardening practices, however, chemical controls are not a practical management plan for larger natural areas. = Biological Control = Populations of M. callizona in their native range are much smaller than Florida populations because they are likely regulated a specialist parasitoid that is not present in the invaded Florida range. The use of parasitoid Lixadmontia franki, which preys on a closely related weevil species in Honduran cloud forests, has been suggested.Suazo, A., Arismendi, N., Frank, J.H., Cave, R.D. (2006). Method for continuously rearing Lixadmontia franki (Diptera: Tachinidae), a potential biological control agent of Metamasius callizona (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae). Florida Entomologist 89: 348-353 Adult L. franki females lay their eggs on bromeliad plants in areas displaying fresh M. callizona activity; the fly larvae then mobilize and target weevil larvae which they kill before the host has a chance to pupate. L. franki have been documented as natural parasitoids of M. callizona. L. franki were captive-raised and studied for several years, after an adequate amount of research and the preparation of proper permits they were released in 2007 in an attempt to control weevil populations. Bromeliad seeds of several species, particularly those rendered endangered by M. callizona, were collected for release if the biological control proved to be effective.

Historical revolutionary governments =Philippine Revolution= The First Philippine Republic was under a revolutionary government. A first revolutionary government was initially established by the Katipunan during the Philippine Revolution in 1892, and was reestablished under a new constitution in 1894. The Tejeros Convention of 1897 was held to reconcile the arguments of the two factions of the Katipunan: Magdalo and Magdiwang, and it was decided that the Katipunan must be dissolved to have an election of officers for a revolutionary government. The independence of the Philippines from Spain was declared by Katipunan leader, Emilio Aguinaldo, who is recognized as the first President of the country, on June 12, 1898. Six days later a revolutionary government over the Philippines was officially declared. =Republic of Negros= The Republic of Negros (Hiligaynon: Republika sang Negros; Cebuano: Republika sa Negros; Spanish: Rep√∫blica de Negros) was initially established during the Spanish-American War as a short-lived cantonal revolutionary republic seated in Bacolod, Negros island. On November 5, 1898, Spanish officials surrendered themselves to local Visayan leaders and a provisional government was established. The Federal Republic of Negros was established on January 1, 1899 and a notice of this was sent to Emilio Aguinaldo in Luzon. Negros Island came under U.S. protection on April 30, 1899 as a separate state from the rest of the Philippine Islands.Two-article series: A constitution which proposed two governors, a U.S. military governor and a civil governor elected by the voters of Negros, was framed by a committee sitting in Bacolod and sent to General Otis in Manila and was proclaimed to take effect on October 2, 1899. This reconstituted Republic operated smoothly until the province of Occidental Negros was established on April 20, 1901, and annexed to the Philippine Islands by the United States as The Republic of Negros. =Tagalog Republic= Tagalog Republic (Filipino: Republika ng Katagalugan or Republikang Tagalog) is a term used to refer to two revolutionary governments involved in the Philippine Revolution against Spain and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. One in 1896-1897 by Andr√©s Bonifacio and the other in 1902-1907 by Macario Sakay, who viewed it as a continuation of the former. Both were connected to the Katipunan revolutionary movement.'' = Republic of Zamboanga = The Republic of Zamboanga was a short-lived sovereign republic, founded on February 28, 1899 by General Vicente Alvarez with his Zamboangue√±o Revolutionary Forces after the Spanish government in Zamboanga officially surrendered and turned over Real Fuerza de Nuestra Se√±ora La Virgen del Pilar de Zaragoza to Gen. Vicente √Ålvarez in May 1899. Gen. Vicente √Ålvarez proclaimed independence and became the first and last genuinely elected president of the republic. Alverez's cohort, Datu Mandi, flew the white flag over Fort Pilar on November 16, 1899 to signal American forces occupying the Philippines to enter the fort which led to the overthrow of √Ålvarez's government. Thereafter, the nascent republic became a U.S. protectorate or puppet government and Midel as puppet leader of U.S. was allowed to continue as president of the republic for about sixteen months. =Bangsamoro Republik= The Bangsamoro Republik, officially the United Federated States of Bangsamoro Republik, was a short-lived, self-proclaimed, unrecognized breakaway state in the Philippines. Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front, issued the Proclamation of Bangsamoro Independence on July 27, 2013 in Talipao, Sulu and declared the capital of Bangsamoro to be Davao City. =Aquino administration= President Corazon Aquino declared a revolutionary government following the People Power Revolution. Following the fall of the authoritarian administration of President Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippines was praised worldwide in 1986, when the so-called bloodless revolution erupted, called EDSA People Power‚Äôs Revolution. Due to the People Power Revolution of February 1986, Marcos' successor, President Corazon Aquino established a revolutionary government with the signing of the \\"Freedom Constitution\\" by the virtue of Proclamation No. 3, which established human rights as the core of Philippine democracy.

With his statement in his speech,‚ÄúI have enough problems with criminality, drugs, rebellion and all, but if you push me to the extreme, I will declare the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and I will arrest all of you,\\" his threat drew concerns to democracy and human rights advocates. \\"If he declares a revolutionary government does this mean that he is abandoning his oath?\\", Vice President Leni Robredo's statement after hearing the threat of the President. Declaring a revolutionary government is against the constitution and as an elected leader, he promised to protect the 1987 Constitutiion, she further added. The President was also criticized when he cited the revolutionary government of Corazon Aquino, experts disagree with his citing of Aquino's People Power Revolution as the 1986 revolution was initiated by the people of the Philippines, and not by an incumbent president. Wendell Philips, an American abolitionist, advocate for Native Americans, orator, and attorney, as early as 19th century, already wrote:\\"revolutions are not made, they come\\". It is not something that can be easily declared or proclaimed. In order for the President to proclaim it, there must be a revolution.The opposition criticized Duterte's statements, stating that his revolutionary government will be another martial law age in the Philippines. He has threatened communist rebels of arrest and a full-scale war against the CPP‚ÄìNPA‚ÄìNDF once a revolutionary government that would last until the end of his term was declared. Though by November 2017, Duterte has dropped the idea saying that he doesn't need to declare a revolutionary government in order to arrest communist rebels.  Possible Effects of Declaring a Revolutionary Government  The Social Weather Survey of December 2017 reported that 39% of Filipinos disagree with the prospective of declaring a Revolutionary Government. A Manila Times article reporting survey results observed that revolutions dismantle the state, inflict physical and structural violence on institutions and people, and overthrow the Constitution. The article observed that a coup initiated against a sitting government can lead to the rule of a junta-like body named as a revolutionary government..

History In 1934, after the creation of Italian Libya, Mussolini adopted a policy for encouraging comparisons with Islam, calling the local population \\"Italian Muslims of the fourth shore of Italy\\", building or restoring mosques and Quranic schools, preparing service facilities for the pilgrims going to Mecca and even making a High School of Islamic Culture in Tripoli. Behind the apparent humanitarian intent, the Fascists and some sectors of the Islamic world were recognizing that Mussolini's policy targeted the common enemies of Fascist Italy and Islam, France and the United Kingdom. These common interests were generated from the aversion to the agreements of the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, dominated by the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, which had neither fully satisfied the requests brought forth by Italy, nor the requests from this part of the Islamic world. Mussolini on horseback with the Sword of Islam In order to earn the favor of the Arabs and to seal himself the alliance, Mussolini, although a signatory of the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See, decided to have bestowed on him the title of Protector of Islam. According to the interpretation of Mussolini, with the Italian government taking over the place of the Ottomans in Libya, such a title was up to him concerning law since, in some manner, he was heir of the authority of the caliph. On March 20, 1937, in the outskirts of Tripoli, Mussolini received the Sword of Islam from Iusuf Kerisc, a leading Berber supporter of the Italian occupation against the Libyan resistance, during a lavish ceremony. After entering Tripoli among salutes of cannons and at the head of a rank of 2,600 cavalrymen, Mussolini reaffirmed his closeness to the Muslim population, guaranteeing \\"peace, justice, wellness and respect for the laws of the Prophet.\\" In spite of the approval from the media of the regime, the ceremony provoked hilarity among the Italian people because of its absurd and paradoxical connotations. One of the photographs of the event, depicting Mussolini on the saddle of a horse held by the halter by a groom, in his official version was retouched and published deleting the groom, in order to make it appear that Mussolini was able to ride his own mount without anyone's help. The detail is often cited as one of the more typical examples of the art of falsification established in the totalitarian regime. The following year, a horse monument was inaugurated in the main square of the Libyan capital in honor of Mussolini. Its base read: \\"To Benito Mussolini, peacemaker of the people, redeemer of the land of Libya, the mindful population and exhibitions where the Sword of Islam flashed consecrate in the sign of the Lictor a loyalty that challenges the destiny.\\" The sword, decorated in arabesque, equipped with a double-edged straight blade and with a hilt and solid gold friezes, had been achieved from the art firm Picchiani e Barlacchi di Firenze on the order of Mussolini himself. After 1937, it was no longer used and was guarded in a small glass reliquary at Rocca delle Caminate, summer residence of Mussolini. There were no more signs of the precious object after July 25, 1943, when Rocca delle Caminate was ravaged and plundered by the Italian resistance.

Castro is a Defense lawyer who studied Law and Criminal science at the University of Costa Rica and has a Doctorate degree in Mediation from Universidad La Salle. Castro was Minister of Public Safety between 1994 and 1997 during the presidency of Jos√© Mar√≠a Figueres (PLN). He became the first cabinet member to receive a Motion of no confidence by the Legislative Assembly when he summoned police forces to fence off Parliament as a means to press for the reform of the Penal Code. Subsequently, Castro resigned as Minister of Safety and was named Minister of Justice. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency as the nominee of the conservative-leaning National Integration Party in the 2018 Costa Rican general election. Castro has been compared unfavorably to US President Donald Trump and other right-wing antiestablishment and right-wing populist figures. Costa Rican general election, 2018 Castro launched his unexpected presidential campaign presenting himself as a political outsider and with a strong anti- establishment and anti-corruption speech. Promising to \\"rule by decree\\" and with a very loud \\"hard hand\\" rhetoric (uncommon in Costa Rican politics as the country is famous for its political centrism), Castro has been compared with figures like Donald Trump, Marine LePen and Rodrigo Duterte, and accused of right-wing populism and far-right positions, albeit he rejects the comparisons. Despite his unexpected lead in the polls throughout most of the campaign, his support plummeted in the final days. Castro came in fifth place, garnering only 9.56% of the votes in the February 4th Presidential Election. His poor performance did not qualify him for the runoff election scheduled for April 1, 2018. Controversies =Antisemitism= In the July 30, 2019 editorial of the newspaper La Naci√≥n, Castro was accused of anti-Semitism for comments made in one of his official videos against the owner of the media CRHoy Leonel Baruch who is Jewish, making allusions and jokes about the Holocaust and also calling him an \\"evil banker.\\" Castro's words were condemned by the Costa Rican Jewish community with an official statement from the Zionist Israelite Center. Castro's statements were also condemned by Israel's ambassador to Costa Rica Amir Ofek, who described them as \\"miserable expressions\\". The heads of most of the benches in the Legislative Assembly, including National Liberation, Citizen Action, Social Christian Unity, Broad Front and Castro's former party National Integration repudiated the expressions, the two Evangelical Christian parties' benches New Republic and National Restoration refused to comment, whilst the independent deputy Erick Rodr√≠guez Steller, who is close to Castro, defended him arguing that his comments were taken out of context. = Homophobic statement= Castro described the government of President of Costa Rica Carlos Alvarado (who is a known supporter of LGBT rights) as maric√≥n, a derogative Spanish word for gay people, after Alvarado's participation on that years' Gay Parade. =Conflict with reporters and the media= On November 24, journalist Arlene Ravent√≥s, who works in the Repretel network, showed that Castro's accusations against her that she was behind an alleged campaign to discredit him, were false. \\"It is unfortunate to have to go out to clarify false information without real content, published in the heat of a political campaign, which should be devoted to raising ideas about the real solution to the country's problems; but when it comes to muddying a name under and without foundation, the need to clarify with the truth prevails and that is what I request\\".https://www.crhoy.com/nacionales/periodista-desmiente-a-candidato- presidencial-juan-diego-castro/ On December 1, 2017, journalist David Delgado, who worked at La Naci√≥n and the Ministry of Justice and Peace, publicly denounced him for \\"persecution, mockery and harassment\\" in relation to coverage of a drug trafficking case. On December 11, 2017, he announced that he would sue the University of Costa Rica because a Facebook program of several young students reported the assault on his mother, his past as a politician and criticized what qualified his \\"right-wing populist\\" tendencies. Panama Papers Castro was mentioned as part of the Panama Papers case by the news reports Amelia Rueda and Semanario Universidad for being lawyer for a Mossack Fonseca law firm related company, which led him to attack Rueda and her son Antonio Jim√©nez, as well as the media Semanario.

She attended University College London and later taught there. She was the author of two monographs, over thirty articles and was a regular reviewer for Antiquaries Journal, Antiquity and Journal of Roman Studies.Women in Old World Archaeology bio at Brown University Brogan initially learned excavation techniques under Mortimer Wheeler at Verulamium and Caerleon, while her MA thesis analysed the Roman frontier in Germany and the relationship of Germanic peoples with the Roman Empire. She was one of the leading excavators at Gergovia in 1930 which expanded knowledge of Gallic oppida, however this work was interrupted by the Second World War. Following the war, Brogan started work at Sabratha in Northern Libya, where she was the chief supervisor under the directorship of Kathleen Kenyon from 1948-1951. While working at Sabratha she supervised an area of domestic housing behind the forum which became known as ‚ÄúCasa Brogan‚Äù and showed a method of excavation which produced excellent stratigraphy and recording. This went against the traditional colonial excavations in North Africa where houses were cleared more than excavated. Brogan's excavated in Libya nearly every year from the 1950s to 1974, particularly in Tripolitania at sites Lepcis Magna with John Ward-Perkins, but she also worked in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, allowing her to compare the different sites and regions. Brogan‚Äôs largest work in Tripolitania was the interior settlement and monumental cemetery at Ghirza, consequently one of the best published site of the Libyan interior. Brogan excavated the site alongside Emilio Vergera-Cafarelli and David Smith over four seasons. This work showed structures which fit into the tradition in Roman Africa of fusing Hellenistic, Punic and Roman traditions with African ritual needs and ideologies. In the 1970s, Brogan also produced a publication of a previously unknown 6 km long Roman linear barrier made of stone wall and bank and ditch. This was significant as it marked the continuation of frontier earthworks already known in Tunisia. Between 1969-74, Brogan was appointed as the first Honorary Secretary for the Society for Libyan Studies. In 1984 the Society organised a conference in her honour, resulting in the publication of 'Town and Country in Roman Tripolitania: Papers in honour of Olwen Hackett'.  Published Works  * Brogan.

It is a spin-off installment of the Scooby Doo live-action film series. The film is a prequel/spin-off featuring the title characters Daphne Blake and Velma Dinkley. The film is produced by Ashley and Jennifer Tisdale's Blondie Girl Productions along with Blue Ribbon Content. It premiered at the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo (C2E2) on April 7, 2018, and was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Digital HD on May 22, 2018, by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Plot Daphne Blake is a high school student who has a semi- popular web show discussing the possibility of aliens and supernatural occurrences. Velma Dinkley is Daphne's supportive yet critical online friend, who believes there is a logical explanation for everything. After Velma web chats Daphne following her latest episode, she reveals to Velma that her parents will be moving to Ridge Valley, where Velma currently goes to high school. After having a perfect morning at home, Daphne embarks on her first day at Ridge Valley High. She quickly meets Carol, her senior advisor, who shows her the school's expansive collection of advanced technology from Bloom Innovative, a famous technology company headed by Tobias Bloom. While on her tour, Daphne runs into Velma, who does not speak to her. Later that afternoon, Daphne sees a student named Spencer walk into an open locker as if he were in a trance. At home, Daphne's father reveals that he has sheltered Daphne all her life, going to extreme lengths to follow her around everywhere in an attempt to make Daphne's life \\"perfect\\". Shocked and frustrated at her father, Daphne vows to do everything on her own without her father's assistance. The next day, Daphne gets into a heated argument with Velma over their science project, which Velma intentionally sabotaged. The argument results in the girls getting sent to the principal's office, who puts them on \\"the best couch for conflict resolution\\". The couch helps the girls put aside their differences, and Velma reveals she was protecting Daphne because she knew of the strange happenings at the school. Daphne and Velma vow to solve the mystery of the disappearing students. The girls notice Spencer acting unnaturally robotic, and suspect another student named Griffin Griffiths. Griffin's family have a legacy receiving an internship from Bloom Innovative, which Spencer was currently slated to be offered. Daphne and Velma follow Griffin around, but he also goes into the same locker as Spencer and disappears, ruling him out as the suspect. The girls realize the only way to figure out who is behind the disappearances is for Velma to be in the running to receive the Bloom internship, by placing herself on top the Bloom Bracket, a competitive ranking system designed to grade students on academics and extracurriculars. Mikayla, a mutual friend of Daphne and Velma's, is currently on top of the Bloom Bracket. Daphne attempts to help Velma win the internship, though in the process, they have to sabotage other students to protect them. The plan works, and Velma rises up to second place. However, they are unable to push Mikayla out of the top spot due to her extensive extracurricular involvement and passion for art. As a back-up plan, the girls cut the power to Mikayla's art exhibit, but the plan backfires when they see a cloaked ghost. Daphne and Velma discover a secret room while trying to escape from the ghost. With the ghost still chasing them, the girls devise a plan to trip the ghost. They find out that the ghost is actually Daphne's father in a bathrobe, who is still following Daphne around. After Daphne responds coldly, her father realizes that Daphne is capable of handling herself, and he was simply frightened for her and wanted to shelter her from the world. Daphne web chats her mother, who is captured by Tobias Bloom. The girls realize Bloom is behind the disappearances, and go to his company headquarters with the help of Daphne's father. The girls confront Tobias Bloom after sneaking into the headquarters, but discover he is simply a hologram. Daphne and Velma find Carol, who reveals that she created Bloom Innovative and posed as a student at Ridge Valley High. She attempted to use the cover of the company to kidnap students and steal their inventive ideas to get rich and famous. Carol is quickly apprehended by police. The girls return to the newly reformed school, and reunite with Mikayla and Spencer. Daphne and Velma return home from school to see that their computer screen is hacked by a possibly real phantom, who threatens the girls to stay away. Not frightened by the apparition, the girls vow to check the mystery out.

The film was announced to be a prequel spin-off of the classic Scooby-Doo franchise, which would focus only on the two female lead characters. Sarah Gilman and Sarah Jeffery were cast as Velma and Daphne, respectively. On March 27, 2018, a release date of May 22, 2018 was set for the film to be released on DVD, Blu- Ray and digital platforms. In an interview with Icon Vs. Icon that took place five days before the release of the film, Sarah Gilman revealed that the movie was filmed in 17 or 18 days. Gilman additionally mentioned that the film was intended to be empowering for women and young girls, stating that \\"This is a really good film in that it shows two young, strong females who aren‚Äôt constantly talking about boys or are damsels in distress who are waiting for someone to rescue them. They are proactive and fast-thinking. They are very real characters who are scared at times but find their strength and inner courage to keep moving forward and kind of control their own destiny. I think that‚Äôs a really important message in the media right now for young females because, historically, we haven‚Äôt seen much of it. I‚Äôm hoping that is the message that anyone can take away from this film!\\"  Reception  Danielle Solzman of Solzy At The Movies positively reviewed the film, praising it for its acting and message of female empowerment. Solzman states \\"The film could not come at a better time for women. Even though new stories are being told, the script stays true to the history...Sarah Gilman is absolutely astonishing in her approach to Velma Dinkley. The actress takes what we love about the character and makes it her own. It ought to be a performance that fans will come to enjoy as the franchise goes in this new direction\\". Andrews Shearer of the Augusta Chronicle additionally praised the strong female characters in the film. \\"By not including the other members of Mystery Incorporated, Daphne & Velma breaks out of the decades-old template viewers are used to (not a single reference to the male characters in the franchise is made) and forges its own refreshing path, owing more to indie flicks like Ghost World than the source material. Unlike the previous two theatrical Scooby-Doo films that aimed to be as faithful to the classic cartoons as possible, Daphne & Velma puts the focus on empowered female relationships and images of women in technology, effectively dismantling nearly every trope of high school movies along the way\\". Renee Schonfeld of Common Sense Media saw things very differently, panning the film by giving it just two stars out of five. Schonfeld derides the spin-off, stating despite the fact that, \\"The Two Sarahs (Jeffery and Gilman) as Daphne and Velma give it their all... a routine story, cheesy effects, and subpar writing let them down\\".

Radiohead and other recording artists offered tributes and condolences. In June 2013, Live Nation Canada Inc, two other organisations and an engineer were charged with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws. The hearing began in June 2015, but a mistrial was declared after the judge was appointed to Ontario Superior Court and lost jurisdiction. The case was dropped in September 2017 under the Jordan ruling, which puts time limits on cases. Radiohead condemned the decision. In 2019, a Canadian inquest found that the roof had not been strong enough to support the stage equipment and returned a verdict of accidental death. A second inquest, held in the UK later in the year, found that inadequate technical advice and construction techniques were responsible for Johnson's death.  Collapse  Radiohead performing in Taiwan, 2012 On 16 June 2012, the English rock band Radiohead were due to perform the final concert of their 2012 North American tour in support of their eighth album, The King of Limbs, in Downsview Park, Toronto. The tour had extensive visual components and required 11 trucks to transport its equipment. Radiohead were due to be on stage for the soundcheck, but construction of the temporary stage was behind schedule. The band members were sequestered nearby while their road crew prepared equipment. The weather was calm, with light winds forecast. At 2pm, Radiohead‚Äôs business manager Ade Bullock noticed that scaffolding on the stage appeared to be drooping, and took a photograph. He did not challenge it as he was not knowledgeable about engineering. At 4pm, an hour before gates were due to open to concertgoers, the stage roof collapsed. Drummer Philip Selway recalled a sound \\"like an enormous cabinet of glasses falling over\\". Drum technician Scott Johnson was killed instantly by a falling video monitor weighing . Three other members of Radiohead's crew were injured, one seriously. The band's light show and much of their musical equipment was also destroyed. The concert was cancelled and Radiohead's tour dates in Europe were postponed. Radiohead considered abandoning touring after the collapse. Selway said: \\"When we came away, it was, 'God, do we want to do this ever again?' If it causes this, can we do it?\\" They decided to continue as a way of \\"working through the trauma\\". Three weeks later, at a vigil before their next performance, Radiohead offered their crew the chance to leave; all chose to stay. In 2013, singer Thom Yorke wrote that completing the tour was his biggest achievement: \\"I was terrified about it, then it got dark, but in the end we were all very proud of managing to pull it off.\\"  Tributes  Drum technician Scott Johnson, 33, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, had worked with acts including Robyn, the Killers, Keane and White Lies. Shortly after the collapse, Selway wrote on Radiohead's website: \\"We have all been shattered by the loss of Scott Johnson, our friend and colleague. He was a lovely man, always positive, supportive and funny; a highly skilled and valued member of our great road crew. We will miss him very much. Our thoughts and love are with Scott's family and all those close to him.\\" Other tributes came from artists including Keane, White Lies, and Caribou, the Canadian band set to open for Radiohead. Elton John called Johnson's family to offer his condolences. All of Radiohead and their road crew attended Johnson's funeral. In July, Radiohead paid tribute to Johnson at their first concert after the collapse, in N√Æmes, France, performing their single \\"Reckoner\\" as an encore while screens showed images of Johnson. Selway's second solo album, Weatherhouse (2014), and Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool (2016), are dedicated to Johnson. Johnson's parents used royalties from Keane's charity EP Upstairs At United ‚Äì Vol. 5, along with almost ¬£3500 raised by Radiohead fans and ¬£1200 of church and family donations, to create the Scott Johnson Bursary Fund. The fund distributes drum kits to schools and teachers with help from Yamaha and the music shop where Johnson once worked. In 2015, Selway, Stephen Morris of New Order and Guy Garvey of Elbow presented a drum kit in Johnson's honour to the Manchester Central Library.  Case  Pitchfork described the collapse as part of a \\"sad streak of stage-related accidents\\", such as the 2011 Indiana State Fair stage collapse, that had prompted \\"industry soul-searching\\". In June 2013, after a year-long investigation, the Ontario Ministry of Labour charged Live Nation Canada Inc, Live Nation Ontario Concerts GP Inc, Optex Staging & Services Inc and the engineer who designed the stage, Domenic Cugliari, with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws. Prosecutor Dave McCaskill sought to prove that Cugliari miscalculated the weight of the stage roof and its attachments by approximately . Live Nation issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and vowing to \\"vigorously defend\\" itself. The hearing was set to begin in June 2015, but was postponed to November as Optex had no lawyer; Optex president Dale Martin eventually represented himself. All defendants pleaded not guilty. After 15 days of hearings, during which Radiohead's managers and crew gave evidence, the court ordered another 15 days throughout 2016. Shortly before June, following the defence's request for more time to present its case, the court scheduled further dates in December and January. In June 2016, the defence persuaded the judge, Shaun Nakatsuru, to drop two charges against Live Nation and one charge against Optex for lack of evidence. Radiohead drummer Philip Selway In June 2017, Nakatsuru declared a mistrial as he had been appointed to the Ontario Superior Court and had lost jurisdiction. As a new trial would not have begun until May 2018, the new judge, Ann Nelson, ruled in favour of the defendants' application to have the case dropped under the Jordan ruling, which rules that defendants have the right to be tried within a \\"reasonable\\" timeframe. Nakatsuru had declined a previous application from the defence. Radiohead released a statement saying: \\"We are appalled by the decision ‚Ä¶ This is an insult to the memory of Scott Johnson, his parents and our crew. It offers no consolation, closure or assurance that this kind of accident will not happen again.\\" Radiohead's management and Johnson's parents met British members of parliament, who wrote to the Canadian High Commission demanding the case be reopened. On 19 July 2018, Radiohead performed at Toronto's Scotiabank Arena, their first performance in Toronto since the collapse. On stage, Yorke condemned the lack of progress in the case. Radiohead held a minute of silence before performing their final song, the 1997 single \\"Karma Police\\". Vice journalist Jill Krajewski observed new meaning in the lyrics \\"karma police / arrest this man\\". Yorke said in September 2019:  2019 inquests  In November 2017, it was announced that the chief coroner of Ontario, Dirk Huyer, would hold an inquest into Johnson's death. In a statement, Radiohead welcomed the inquest but said it would provide no justice for the Johnsons, and urged the Canadian authorities to reopen the case. The inquest began on 25 March 2019 and ran until April 10, with testimonies from 25 witnesses, including Selway, Optex employees, and Johnson's father. Optex owner Dale Martin testified that the stage design had called for a truss component that Optex did not have. He said that Optex staff had known about the problem for years, and that he had alerted engineer Cugliari many times. Cugliari admitted his design contained errors, but said that he believed Optex had used the required truss. No building permits or inspections were obtained for the stage because the concert venue, Downsview Park, is on land owned by the federal government. Ontario's building code does not apply to federal land, and no third-party oversight is required for temporary structures. The inquest heard that the roof grid was not strong enough to bear the load of lights, screens and speakers, which weighed roughly , crushing the pickup trusses. The roof design had been used since the late 80s or early 90s, and had been approved by engineer George Snowden. Snowden had been disciplined by the Professional Engineers of Ontario for his role in the fatal collapse of a scaffold on the Ambassador Bridge. Only Martin admitted culpability, saying: \\"The system failed. Not just the truss. My people. Me. I'm responsible.\\" The five-person jury proposed 28 non-binding recommendations, including the creation of a group to develop and maintain standards and procedures for the live performance industry. A verdict of accidental death was returned. Radiohead released a statement praising the inquest as \\"constructive, thorough and fair-minded\\". In October 2019, a second inquest was held in Doncaster, Johnson's hometown. Coroner Nicola Mundy found that \\"inadequate technical advice\\" and \\"wholly inadequate construction techniques\\" were responsible for Johnson's death. Radiohead released a statement asking for \\"those others responsible to finally and publicly admit their part in this terrible incident\\".

The exact origin of the statue remains unknown, though it is believed to be somewhere on the Peloponnese.Mertens 1985, p. 37 It was found on the island of Cyprus. The statue is currently displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  History  This piece is dated sometime between the years 480 and 460 BCE. This period of time saw many cultural and artistic changes for the Greek mainland. The creation of this statue would have coincided with the final events of the Persian Wars, a series of major conflicts of the Greek city states and the Persian empire. The Greeks emerged victorious after the Battle of Plataea, and with the victory a new unity emerged within Greece. For the first time in its history, Greece proved itself to be a force to be reckoned with in the ancient world. This attitude permeated all facets of Greek culture, including the arts. With each passing year, more and more archaic traits in the artwork were taken away until Classicism was fully embraced by the people.  Diskos throwing  This event was a very popular sport in the Greek community. The goal was to throw a diskos as far as possible. The diskos, usually made out of metal, was rather heavy and required precise form to throw properly. Most were flat, although it was possible that some had a slight bulge at the center. The first landing of the diskos to the thrower would be the distance measured. A demanding activity, this sport required the athlete to be in peak ability to perform competitively. Based on the many depictions of the throw, it is also evident that the action needed a high degree of coordination. Technique varied depending on the athlete. However, unlike the more horizontal arc of modern- day diskos throwers, the arc of the throw from this era was far more vertical. There are at least three known commonly used methods of throwing. The method that the unknown athlete in the statue uses begins with the diskos being held by the left hand. Before it is thrown, it is rested upon the shoulder. The right foot is firmly planted into the ground for stability and balance against the heavily bent left arm. From this point, the diskos is swung, and also rapidly handed off to the right hand before being released. The second method began with the arms in close proximity with the body. The diskos itself would be held with both hands, and the core engaged to keep the motion controlled. With the left leg in proper position, the thrower would then bring the arms up at a quick rate. If performed correctly, the hands would end up about level with the head. The third method bears a strong resemblance to another artwork, the Standing Discobolos. Similar to the bronze diskos thrower, the right foot is forward and grounded. The left hand holds the diskos with the full length of the arm until it was swung up and passed off to the right arm, after which it was released.  Style  Although the timeline of this piece suggests that it would be Classical, this statue is not entirely within a single style of Greek art. There are multiple facets of the piece that can be attributed to either the Classical style, archaic style, or transitional work that can not be fully categorized. The idealized, young athletic body is indicative of Classical style work. However, there are many features of the statue that exhibit features from other styles. The bowl-shaped ears are heavily reminiscent of archaic style work. Proportionally, they are incorrect due to their positioning. They are far too high in relation to the eyes. The eyes themselves feature very heavy eyelids. That, and their strong definition, suggest that they draw their influence from earlier periods of time. The chin also appears unnatural. In comparison to the rest of the face, it is unusually long. The hair is not as simple to categorize. It almost appears as if it were meant to be a helmet, further accentuated with the lack of any incising, though it is possible that the original incising has faded away over time.  Description  The statue depicts a young nude athlete ready to throw a diskos. The statue is almost intact save for the left foot and the entire right arm. Though the right arm is missing, images from vase paintings suggest that the right arm would be relaxed with an open hand. The arm would be slightly bent at the elbow. Still, enough remains that it is not impossible to decipher the action. Standing at only around 9 inches, the statue is rather small. The body is muscular, and there are clear details for the chest, shoulders, abdomen, and iliac furrow. The bronze has oxidized and dulled, though there are a few small sections of the piece that retain their original metallic luster. The expression suggests that this is not someone who is carrying out a simple task. Rather, it is meant to portray an athlete that has fully accustomed himself to the sport.

Based on Ti√´sto, this compilation was created mainly for festival and stadium play, in front of large audiences. \\"The stuff on this album is what I want to play, and the crowd I see over there in China inspires me and us to make this style of music,\\" says Ti√´sto. He first met John Christian in 2013 through his remake of Ti√´sto's Flight 643, and was attracted by his music production. \\"He has a very special production quality that is a lot higher than most producers in the world. He then introduced me to SWACQ (Sounds With A Certain Quality), and we decided to create this whole movement together,\\" explained Ti√´sto. They then decided to collaborate to create an album with the SWACQ sound collective, whose tracks would represent the feeling of DJs who are performing live. \\"I wanted to really bring back the feeling I get when I‚Äôm onstage, back into the music. I really tried to create an album that represents the feeling literally when you‚Äôre DJing live,\\" says Ti√´sto. Besides John Christian, this album also features collaborations with other music producers and singers, such as KSHMR, Diplo, Talay Riley, Vassy, Aloe Blacc, and ex South Korean-Chinese boy group Exo member Huang Zitao. During an interview conducted with Highsnobiety, Ti√´sto stated that the inspiration to create the album came from him noticing the apparent lack of energetic tracks in the EDM scene. \\"Since a lot of DJs have gone into pop lately, I decided to do the opposite and make an album full of big room, energetic bangers. This album was designed to be played at a festival or in a club. I made it for myself because I couldn‚Äôt find enough energetic, up-tempo music,\\" voiced Ti√´sto. He also mentioned that the fast-growing music scene in China has fascinated and impressed him, as there‚Äôs \\"such excitement everywhere you go and with every crowd you play for\\". Critical reception Karlie Powell from Your EDM commented that with \\"banger after banger\\", the collection of \\"pounding festival anthems\\" manages to go \\"hard\\", which succeeds in channelling the \\"feeling of a massive show\\" through one's speakers and reaching the high bar set by previously released single \\"Scream\\".

He studied composition and conducting at Lviv Conservatory and musicology at John Casimir University in Lviv under Adolf Chybi≈Ñski. From 1949 he taught in the School (later became an Institute) of Musicology of Warsaw University. From 1951 to 1968, he also worked at the State Institute of Art which became the Institute of Art of the Polish Academy of Sciences in since 1959. He trained several generations of Polish musicologists. From 1956 to 1971 he was editor-in-chief of the quarterly Muzyka. His impressive scholarly output covers works on music history from the Middle Ages to contemporary times. Among his publications (partly with his wife, Krystyna Wilkowska-Chomi≈Ñska) are the monumental Musical forms (Formy muzyczne) in 5 volumes published in Krak√≥w between 1954 and 84, History of harmony and counterpoint (Historia harmonii i kontrapunktu) in 3 volumes (1958-1990) and History of music (Historia muzyki powszechnej) in 2 volumes (1989‚Äì90). He also authored several books on music theory and the history of Polish music, and is known for the development of the theory of sonology. Chomi≈Ñski's Chopinological works are characterised by an holistic treatment of the musical work, typical of this scholar, involving such aspects as the analysis of texture and colouring, often overlooked in earlier musicological research, and the examination of interdependencies between the various elements in a work. In his first published book on Chopin's music, employing his own creatively modified version of the Erpf-Riemann method, he carried out an analysis of the Preludes, demonstrating the cyclical character of Op. 28 and drawing attention to such aspects as the common motivic material integrating the work. In his monograph of the Chopin sonatas, he defended the C minor Sonata, pointing out its logical construction and unity of expression, characteristic of Chopin's sonatas, and also the Cello Sonata, which he regarded as an important stage in the later development of this form. Taking issue with Hugo Leichtentritt, among others, he also saw the Funeral March as a key to the interpretation of the B flat minor Sonata. In other studies, he dealt with texture and harmony in Chopin (showing their mutual influence) and the problem of the periodisation of his oeuvre. He made use of these studies in his book on Chopin, which represents a more popular and synthesising approach to the composer's life and work. References Further reading * Go≈ÇƒÖb, Maciej (2008).
