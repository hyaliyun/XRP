Background and formation On 6 April 1854, soon after the declaration of war by Britain and France on Russia, the British steam frigate , under the command of Captain William Loring, sailed to Odessa and sent a boat into the port under a flag of truce to collect the British Consul there. When leaving the port the boat was fired upon by the Russians. The British naval commander Vice-Admiral James Dundas demanded an explanation from Lieutenant-General Dmitri Osten-Sacken, the military governor of Odessa, for this breach of the laws of war. His reply was considered unacceptable, so a squadron was quickly selected to mount a punitive expedition. An article by Karl Marx, printed in the New York Daily Tribune of 16 May 1854, reported that the Russians had claimed that the Furious was actually carrying out a covert reconnaissance of the port, as the Retribution had done some time earlier, entering the port of Sevastopol under the pretext of delivering dispatches, but also making a survey of the defences, as had been admitted by the British press. Marx also pointed out the \\"ridiculousness\\" of the Allies requiring such justifications for launching an attack on an enemy naval base in a time of war. The squadron consisted of eight steam paddle-wheel frigates; the French Descartes, Mogador and Vauban, and the British , , , and , supported by the British screw frigate , fourth-rate sailing frigate , and steam ship , and the French screw corvette Caton. There were also six ship's boats armed with 24-pounder rockets; two from , and one each from , , Sans Pareil and Highflyer. The bombardment On 22 April the Anglo-French fleet arrived off Odessa, and lay offshore. At 5 a.m. the first division (Descartes, Sampson, Tiger and Vauban) sailed in, and opened fire on the Russian positions from a range of about , though with little effect. Vauban was hit by a red-hot shot that started a fire aboard and was obliged to temporarily withdraw. She soon returned, bringing the screw corvette Caton with her. The second division (Furious, Terrible, Retribution and Mogador) then joined the attack, while Arethusa, Highflyer and Sans Pareil remained further offshore as a reserve. The attacking ships now anchored closer in, and it was not long before a shot from Terrible hit a magazine on the Imperial Mole, which exploded causing great damage. About 24 Russian ships in the military port were set on fire, and several British and French merchant ships detained there took advantage of the confusion to escape. Meanwhile, the rocket-boats set fire to the dockyard storehouses. Late in the action the Arethusa, under the command of Captain William Robert Mends, engaged batteries on the south side of the Quarantine Mole, until recalled. As numerous fires were now threatening the town, the attack was ended at 5.30 p.m., and the squadron withdrew. Casualties were very light; two killed and one wounded in Vauban, three wounded in Retribution, six wounded in Sampson, and one killed and four wounded in Terrible. Effects As a result of this \\"affair of honour\\", Odessa was essentially neutralised as a naval base, and remained so for the rest of the war, allowing the Allies to operate in the Black Sea with impunity and to thus maintain their supply lines following the subsequent invasion of the Crimean Peninsula in September.

In addition to a number of significant inventions improving wireless radio (RF) communication and voltage/power regulation devices, he is also the longest serving Chief Executive Officer of a Silicon Valley company (Micrel Corporation, acquired in 2015 by Microchip Technology).  Early life  Born on September 24, 1937, to Milton and Pauline Zinn, Ray Zinn grew up on a cattle ranch in the farming community of El Centro, CA. The eldest of 11 children, including six sisters and four brothers, Zinn was raised a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and a strong work ethic was instilled at an early age by his parents. When he was four, his mother sent him to the store to lug home heavy bottles of milk. He had a driver's license at 13 to chauffeur his siblings in a Ford pickup and work with water management officials in the dead of night to assure the family ranch received their allocation. \\"Work becomes instilled in you from an early age. So if somebody asks me how 'success' is spelled, I tell them it's spelled W-O-R-K.\\" Ray Zinn, high school, gymnastics poseThroughout his high school and college years, Zinn was an accomplished gymnast, hurdler and member of the track and field team. During his junior year in college, he told his father he was quitting school and his father locked him naked, wrapped in a paper towel diaper, in the ranch office restroom for six hours. Zinn's father was giving his son a lesson about what it meant to cut short his education. \\"He was saying, 'Well, if you're going to quit school, you're going out in the world the way you came in.' He wanted me to think about living with decisions,\\" Zinn said. Ray Zinn changed his mind and finished college. He graduated from Brigham Young University in 1960 with a BS in Industrial Management, and an MS in Business Administration from San Jose State University in 1968.  Early career  Before College, Zinn started at a janitorial business, working through sewage and waste on his spare time. He started out with a few years of experience, and quickly learned the way of maintaining hygiene. Although he started out with these humble beginnings, he wanted to be less like his father. His father and family had a long line of doing sanitation https://www.howardzinn.org/about/biography/ services throughout the bay area. After college, Zinn moved to the San Francisco Bay area, where high-tech companies were gaining traction. His interest in the space program and the desire to become an astronaut landed him a position at rocket motor manufacturing, United Technologies. Later, Zinn became interested in semiconductors through his father-in-law, who worked at Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation and joined the company as an engineer in 1963. He left Fairchild in 1968 and subsequently held various executive management positions at several semiconductor-related companies, including Teledyne Inc. (1966–69), Nortek Inc. (1971-73) and Electromask TRE (1973–76). During this period, and later through Micrel, Zinn worked nearly every aspect of semiconductor management; sales, marketing, finance, accounting, wafer fab operations, assembly, packaging, test, quality assurance, and design. While working as a sales representative at Electromask, Zinn conceptualized the Wafer Stepper and sold it, before it had been designed or engineered, to Texas Instruments. According to Zinn, this unauthorized selling of equipment that had not yet been designed caused his boss at Electromask to tell him \\"You really shouldn’t work for anybody else.\\" Due to Electromask's partnership with IBM and that company's commitment to e-beam technology, Electromask never sought or acquired the patents for the Wafer Stepper.  Micrel  Physical Layer Transceiver Along with his friend Warren Muller, Zinn founded semiconductor company Micrel in 1978. The pair used $300,000 in savings and bank loans to found the company, eschewing the financial support of venture capitalists. \\"I wanted control of my destiny and to do it my way.\\" Zinn's desire to remain independent led him at one time to personally guarantee $4 million in bank loans to keep Micrel afloat. Under Zinn's leadership, Micrel was profitable in its first year, and for 36 of its 37 years. Zinn credits this success to the company's disciplined focus on profitability. Micrel was also credited with having the lowest employee turn-over in the semiconductor industry and, though it is an unofficial measure, the highest \\"boomerang\\" employee rate, the rate at which employees who leave the company return. During an investor \\"roadshow\\" promoting Micrel's initial public offering in London, England, Zinn suffered a retinal vein occlusion which reduced his vision to 20/400, making Zinn legally blind. Zinn resisted turning control of Micrel over to another CEO. Instead, Zinn took advantage of every technology he could to compensate for his limited eyesight. Zinn continued to lead Micrel for another 20 years. Zinn established a unique corporate culture at Micrel, which included unusual guidelines such as his \\"no swearing\\" policy. Swearing or using condescending language at the company was banned. Workers were also urged to be honest, show integrity and respect others at the company. \\"We believe that work should be an extension of the home.\\" Micrel's humanistic corporate culture has been referred \\"an almost spiritual approach to doing business.\\" Micrel was sold to Microchip Technology in 2015. Zinn was profiled in Sand Hill's leadership series because of the leadership ability demonstrated throughout his tenure as founder and CEO of Micrel.

Inventions and patents One of Zinn's most significant inventions includes a method allowing radio devices to operate without the need to synchronize a receiver with a Transmitter. Using Frequency hopping and sweep modes, this method is primarily applied in low data rate wireless applications such as utility metering, machine and equipment monitoring and metering, and remote control. In 2006 Zinn received for his \\"Wireless device and method using frequency hopping and sweep modes.\\" Zinn also invented a method to quickly encode and/or decode RF signals. This technology forms the core of a number of devices, including (but not limited to) garage door openers and accompanying remote access; security or alarm systems and a remote access to activate and deactivate the security system; and low power, two-way radio communication devices. Other inventions * A transmitter power level optimization and error correction technique for battery-operated RF transceivers which adjust the transmit power in transceivers to an optimal level to conserve battery life. * Voltage regulators (including voltage regulators having pulse width modulation or PWM and a low drop out or LDO modes) as well as a hybrid voltage regulator containing a switching regulator and a linear regulator for converting an unregulated voltage, such as a battery voltage, to a regulated DC voltage of a desired value. Zinn is also accredited with the development of the analog control of a digital decision process, an achievement he shares with Peter Chambers and Scott Brown; a pulse frequency modulated voltage regulator with linear regulator control (in collaboration with Charles L. Vinn), as well as: * An apparatus for converting voltage with regulator * A circuit having trim pads formed in scribe channel, and * A voltage regulation system Authorship In 2015, Zinn wrote Tough Things First (Published by McGraw Hill Education), in which he distilled his knowledge of leadership and management. Tough Things First is an autobiographical treatise on the interaction of people, management, and leadership, Self-discipline and organization discipline, and the mechanics of enterprises. In 2018, Zinn wrote Zen of Zinn, in which he discusses the interrelationships of people, society, entrepreneurship, business, leadership and life Critical response to works T.J. Rodgers, President & CEO, Cypress Semiconductor Corp \\"Tough Things First is not a typical business book about a market success or effective business methods. It is about the success of one Silicon Valley startup company, Micrel, which has been run profitably by the same CEO/founder for 36 years. It is about how a founder's dedication to basic principles is required to make any startup successful. The precise recipe for success may change—for example, my 32-year-old company, Cypress Semiconductor, used venture funding, while Zinn preached and achieved financial independence—but Zinn shows how startups must have and truly practice their core values to succeed.\\" Greg McKeown, Author of the New York Times bestseller Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less. \\"The disciplined pursuit of what is essential is ten times harder than the undisciplined pursuit of the nonessential but it is a hundred times more valuable. This is brilliantly illustrated in Tough Things First.\\" Reed Wilcox, President of Southern Virginia University said of Tough Things First \\"Many business self-help books are by experts who study and talk to the people who actually do it, but have not lived it themselves. It's not in their blood. This is very different. I have not seen a better, more practical, more realistic, more helpful, or more engaging invitation to entrepreneurship.\\" China Zinn has been a vocal advocate of disengaging the technology industry from China. He coined the phrase \\"Chinexit\\" to describe the act of moving business operations out of China.https://twitter.com/Ray_Zinn_/status/1148639198695419904 Zinn has stated that \\"Unimpeded, China will control major parts of the entire electronics supply chain and, in effect, control much of the world.\\" Zinn's company, Micrel, was notable in the semiconductor industry for not having fabrication facilities in China.

She became the first trans woman sub-inspector in Tamil Nadu, India.  Early life  Prithika Yashini was born and brought up as Pradeep Kumar (a male name), the son of a driver-tailor couple in Salem, Tamil Nadu. She had a difficult childhood where her parents took her to temples, doctors, astrologers to 'set things right'. When she was in grade ninth, she felt different and didn't feel like a boy. She completed her undergraduation in computer applications. In 2011, she ran away to Chennai, where she found acceptance and support in the transgender community of the city.  Career  She began her career in Chennai working as a warden in a women's hostel. Yashini applied for recruitment as a sub-inspector of police to the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) to fill vacancies for 1087 posts. However, her application was rejected as being a trans woman she did not belong to any of the two specified categories, namely, male or female. Subsequently, she challenged the decision of the TNUSRB in different courts including the High Court of Madras. Accordingly, the High Court of Madras ordered to conduct a written test for her. The test for the recruitment comprises written test, physical endurance test and a viva-voce. With legal recourse in a competent court, she was able to lower the minimum cut-off marks for written test for such a recruitment from 28.5 to 25.00. She cleared all physical endurance tests except missing 100 meter dash by one second. However, she was testified successful in the physical endurance test. In terms of judgement of the Madras High Court, which was delivered on 6 November 2015, directions were given to the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) to appoint K Prithika Yashini as a sub-inspector of police as she is \\"entitled to get the job\\".

He was the head of the Central Soil and Water Conservation Research and Training Institute (CSWCRTI) at its Chandigarh centre. He was a recipient of the fourth highest Indian civilian honour of the Padma Shri.  Contributions  A decade after the Sukhna Lake, conceptualised by Le Corbusier was built, it was detected that sedimentation through the Kansal choe, a seasonal stream, was causing reduction in the depth and size of the lake. In order to find a solution to the problem, CSWCRTI deputed a team in 1975, with Mishra as the project director to Sukhomajri, an arid village at the foothills of Shivalik Hills, in Panchkula district of the Indian state of Haryana. He worked for three years with the local villagers, educating them about the seriousness of the situation and urging them to abandon goat farming which was causing denuding of the forests and shift to cattle farming. He built two check dams across the seasonal stream for rain water harvesting, made water available to villagers for agriculture and was successful in implementing social fencing programme, where the villagers erected fences protecting the forests from cattle grazing. With assistance from the Forest Department of Haryana and the Ford Foundation, he is reported to have transformed the village into a prosperous one. It is reported that the bare slopes of Shivalik Hills were covered with vegetation, the milk production increased nine-fold, the rate of sedimentation was reduced to 1/15th of earlier levels, crop yield increased manifold, and a corpus fund was put in place, under the care of a society, for development activities in the village. A 1992 study by S. K. Dhar, the then Chief Conservator of Forests, confirmed that the tree density also increased from 13 per hectare to 1272 per hectare. Mishra introduced a new concept of cyclical investment, Chakriya Vikas Pranali, where a part of the returns from a scheme becomes the capital of the next project, which is noted to have assisted in increasing rural employment and making the village self-reliant. The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) acknowledged the success of the Sukhomajri project by publishing a case study report, by P. R. Mishra and M. Sarin under the title Social Security Through Social Fencing. The article was included in the 1988 book, The Greening of aid: sustainable livelihoods in practice, published by IIED. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian award of the Padma Shri in 2000, for his services in the fields of ecology and environment.

Extending along Main Street between Whetstone Brook and a junction with Pultney Road and Linden and Walnut Streets, this area includes many of the town's prominent civic and institutional buildings. The area's development took place primarily in the 19th century, with surviving buildings from both the 18th and early 20th centuries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and was enlarged in 2004 to include Plaza Park and the Holstein Building on the south side of Whetstone Brook. Description and history The town of Brattleboro, now the major commercial center of southeastern Vermont, was chartered in 1753 and settled in the 1760s. Its present town center grew around mills that were built on Whetstone Brook. A bridge spanned the adjacent Connecticut River in 1804, making overland travel to points eastward more feasible. In 1811 the first paper mill was built on Whetstone Brook, inaugurating related industries that would come to dominate the town's economy. The railroad arrived in 1849, bringing increased development and commerce. Following a major flood in 1869 and fires in 1869 and 1877, there was a flurry of new development in the downtown area, lasting until about 1910, which gave the area much of its present character. The district is bounded at its northern end by the fourway junction of Main, Linden and Walnut Streets, and Pultney Road. Near this point the 1890 Wells Fountain stands as sentinel marking the upper end of the business district. The district extends from this point southward along Main Street, with a few properties included on side streets that extend westward, to the intersection of Bridge, Canal and Vernon Streets, just south of Whetstone Brook. This intersection is highlighted by Plaza Park, laid out in 1923, which includes as a central feature a casting of Daniel Chester French's Spirit of Life statue. The only buildings included in the district south of the brook are the former railroad station, now the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center, and the Holstein Association Building, its oldest section dating to 1917. Prominent buildings lining Main Street in between include the former Brooks House Hotel, a Second Empire work of Vermont native Elbridge Boyden.

It was the first home venue for the Kent State Golden Flashes football and the first permanent home for the KSU baseball program. The field, sometimes referred to as \\"Normal Field\\", also hosted football games for the Kent State University School. Rockwell Field served as the home field for Kent State football from the team's inception in 1920 through the 1940 season, the baseball team from circa 1920 through the 1941 season, and the men's track team from their foundation in 1922 through the 1940 season. It was replaced by a new athletic complex that included a field for football with a track and an adjacent baseball field. The new football field and track, later to become Memorial Stadium by 1950, were ready for the 1941 football and 1942 track seasons, while the baseball field opened in 1942. After the removal of intercollegiate athletics, Rockwell Field continued to be used for intramural sports and general recreation, becoming known as the Rockwell Commons and eventually as simply \\"the Commons\\". Growth and developments at Kent State during the 1940s led to additional changes to the site, such as adjacent buildings, roads, and sidewalks, as the campus expanded, making the field centrally located after originally having been on the edge of campus. In 1970, the Commons became associated with the Kent State shootings as the site of several student protests in the late 1960s and on the day of the shooting. It was included in the historic district added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 and made a National Historic Landmark in 2017. Although no physical reminders of the field's usage for intercollegiate athletics remain, it continues to be used as a gathering place and for general recreation. History Baseball game or practice at Rockwell in the 1930s. Merrill Hall, the original heating plant, and Lowry Hall can be seen in the background A dedicated athletic field was not part of the original plans for the Kent State Normal School, established in 1910. The first classes were held at the Kent campus in 1913 and intramural and informal athletic teams were formed that year and in early 1914. The school's first president, John McGilvrey, believed in the importance of physical education, but in the form of intramural athletics as opposed to intercollegiate athletics. As a result, athletic facilities were not included in the original plans for the school and attempts to acquire funds from the state to construct them were initially unsuccessful. The men's basketball team was established in 1913 and played their first collegiate game in January 1915. The baseball team was founded in 1914 and played a limited schedule, with a summer team forming during the summer terms. Baseball games were held on an informal field in the area of campus now largely occupied by Rockwell Hall. Early yearbooks expressed hope for better facilities and the reality that the lack of them hampered the development of intercollegiate athletics. Rockwell Field was the first permanent athletic facility at Kent State, followed by Wills Gymnasium in 1925. It was named for David Ladd Rockwell, a member of the Board of Trustees at the time and one of the key members of the delegation that secured the school for Kent in 1910. Rockwell also served as mayor of the city of Kent from 1900 to 1908. Rockwell Hall, opened in 1929 as the school's first library building, is also named after him. The area where Rockwell Field was built had previously been a hilly and wooded area on the southern edge of the campus. It was located behind Merrill and Lowry Halls and adjacent to the school's heating plant, which opened in 1916. In the 1938, a new women's dormitory, Engleman Hall, was built just north of the field. Merrill Hall can be seen in the background The first football team to play at Kent State was that of the university's high school program, which began play in 1917. Early games were held across town at DePeyster Field, the new home of crosstown rival Kent High School. The university, then still a normal school, first attempted to establish a football team in 1914, but only two practice games were held before the athletic board and faculty voted to discontinue the season. The first collegiate football game at Rockwell Field was held November 6, 1920, a 7–0 loss to Bowling Green. The final intercollegiate football game at Rockwell Field was played October 12, 1940, a 26–0 homecoming win over Mount Union, attended by a reported crowd of approximately 5,000. Both the baseball and track and field teams remained at Rockwell Field for their respective 1941 seasons, beginning play at their new facilities in 1942. Facilities View of the field in 1925 prior to bleachers being installed The playing surface ran southwest to northeast and was encircled by a primitive running track. The field was plagued by poor sod and drainage issues and was often described as being rocky or sandy. Seating for spectators consisted of a few rows of wooden bleachers along each sideline. The football team found it difficult to schedule home games as opposing teams did not want to play on the surface. The student newspaper, the Kentonian, called the field an embarrassment. The Flashes enjoyed three consecutive undefeated seasons at Rockwell Field, from 1929 through the 1931 season. During the 1920s, there were no seating areas for fans, so many would park their cars around the perimeter of the field and watch, or they would stand and follow the team as it progressed down the field. During the 1930s, limited bleacher seating was built and additional bleacher seating was added for almost 1,000 fans in time for the 1933 season, increasing seating capacity to approximately 3,000. In 1941, new athletic fields were completed in the area of campus just south of Rockwell Field along Summit Street that had previously been known as the College Farm. Although the baseball field was completed in time for the 1941 season, the grass had not taken root, so the baseball team continued to use Rockwell Field for an additional season. The new athletic fields included separate football and baseball fields with a cinder track around the football field. Memorial Stadium was built around the football field nine years later in 1950, replacing the original wooden stands. Site Site of Rockwell Field in 2014, now known as the Commons After the opening of the new athletic fields in 1941 and 1942, Rockwell Field became known as the Rockwell Commons and the university's first student union was built adjacent to the field in 1949. Parking was already a growing problem in the 1940s, so a debate over the use of Rockwell Field took place with some calling for it to be used for parking, while others favored using it for intramural sports. As the university continued to develop, the western ends of Rockwell Field were used for parking and buildings, though most of it remained an open field known simply as \\"the Commons\\". Prefabricated structures were built on the western end of the area after World War II, including the building that later housed the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). Roads and parking built for the adjacent heating plant and the Art Building occupy the southwestern part of the field area. The Commons has since become associated with the Kent State shootings and forms a large part of the May 4, 1970, Kent State Shootings Site, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 and made a National Historic Landmark in 2017. On the southern edge of the Commons is the Victory Bell, which was placed there in 1950 after being donated by a local railroad. While it was originally rung following KSU football victories, it became associated first with the antiwar movement of the 1960s and ultimately with the events surrounding the Kent State shootings as it was rung to announce the start of demonstrations. It is still rung every May 4 at 12:24pm, the moment of the shootings, to honor those who were killed or injured. The Commons was the site of several protests in the 1960s and into 1970, including those just prior to the shootings on May 4, with the ROTC building burned down by arsonists on May 2, 1970. The Commons continues to be used for general recreation, and is also the site or the annual commemoration of the Kent State shootings.

Biography As his nisba indicates, he was a military slave of the Sajid ruler of Adharbayjan, Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj. After Yusuf died in 928, he was succeeded briefly as ruler by his nephew, and then by Wasif al-Shirvani in 929 as governor of Adharbayjan for the Abbasid Caliphate. He in turn was followed, likely in the same year, by Muflih. Muflih is first mentioned by Ibn al-Athir in office in 931, and held the post at least until 935, when the last coins struck in his name appear. After him the province was taken over by the Khariji Daysam ibn Ibrahim, likewise a former officer of Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, in 937/8. In 929, Muflih defeated the Byzantine Domestic of the Schools, John Kourkouas, in battle. The victorious Muflih then pursued the Byzantines into their own territory. In 931, the Byzantines were engaged in southern Armenia, aiding the ruler of Vaspurakan, Gagik I, who had rallied the local Armenian princes and allied himself with the Byzantines against the local Muslim emirates; the Christian forces raided the Kaysite emirate and razed Khliat and Berkri to the ground, before marching into Upper Mesopotamia and capturing Samosata. Learning of this, Muflih assembled a \\"large army\\" and himself invaded Armenia, defeating Gagik and his Byzantine allies in a battle that according to Ibn al-Athir cost 100,000 Armenians their lives. When Daysam took power in Adharbayjan, Muflih fled to Shirvan and sought refuge with the local autonomous ruler, Abu Tahir Yazid, but the latter handed him over to Daysam to avoid trouble.

Crocker was born on the 31st of December in 1829, daughter of county sheriff and businessman Henry, and Lydia E. Crocker (née Ferris) in Barnstable, Massachusetts. Crocker had ancestors that had settled in the old Commonwealth. Throughout her adolescence she attended Boston public schools. Her family moved to Shawmut Avenue in Boston, were she attended the Normal School for Girls. The school system was established in Lexington, Mass in 1839. She then went on to graduate from the Massachusetts State Normal School in West Newton in 1850. Crocker graduating in 1850 indicates that she likely began her schooling at Massachusetts State Normal School in 1847 or 1848. She attended lectures by J. L. R. Agassiz at Harvard, although at the time women could only attend Harvard as guests. Crocker was progressive in her views on education as she promoted science and valued it as useful knowledge. Career She taught at the State Normal School from 1850 to 1854 when she fell ill and resigned. After leaving Massachusetts she continued her teaching career in Ohio where she started a job as an educator, from 1857 to 1859 she was professor of mathematics and astronomy at Antioch College. The State Normal school in West Newton moved to Framingham M.A. in 1853. It is presently known as Framingham State College, and includes Crocker Hall, a building name in Lucretia Crocker's memory. The construction of this addition began in 1886, the year she died. In 1859 she returned to Boston to care for her parents, and become involved in educational activities there at the Newbury Street School. From 1865 for some years she assisted in selecting the American Unitarian Association's Sunday School books. From 1866 to 1875 she was a member of the New England Freedman's Aid Society's Committee on Teaching. In 1869 she toured the freedmen's schools. She was also teaching botany and mathematics in a private school at around this time. Crocker was elected to the Boston School Committee in 1873. From 1873 to about 1876 she was head of the science department of the Society to Encourage Studies at Home, serving on the board of school supervisors from 1876 to 1886. Crocker died on the 9th of October 1886 in Boston. Her home is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.  Accomplishments  Throughout her life, Lucretia Crocker achieved various accomplishments as one of the first well known female educators in the United States. She was also the first woman elected into the Boston School Committee, and was the first female supervisor in the Boston Public Schools District. Additionally, she was an associate member of the Boston Society of Natural History. She was most well known for her teachings of mathematics and natural science. Around this time her and Mary L Hall co-authored her first book Our World (1864). ,Crocker founded the Women's Education Association in 1872. From 1873-1876 she served as the Head of the Science Department of The Society to Encourage Studies at Home. This was also known as The Silent University. In addition she was also appointed as a member of the committee on Teacher's for the New England. In 1880 Crocker was elected to the America Association of Science. Crocker served the disabled as a member of the executive committee for the Boston School for Deaf Mutes. Later in life (1883), she wrote another book, Methods of Teaching Geography.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Italy and (part of the former country of Yugoslavia) Slovenia. It has yellowish-green, glaucous, lanceolate or ensiform leaves, tall stem, green flushed with purple spathes, 2 short branches, 2–3 scented flowers, in shades of violet, blue-violet, deep purple, blue-purple, deep blue-purple, pale purple, deep blue, to mid-blue. It has a yellow or orange tipped beard. It was originally published as Iris cengialti but then re-classified as a subspecies of Iris pallida, and known as Iris pallida subsp. cengialti, but it is often still called Iris cengialti. It is cultivated as an ornamental garden plant in temperate regions. Description It has a long, stout,Richard Lynch fleshy, light-coloured (underground) rhizome. That is 1–3 cm wide (in diameter), and has long secondary roots. It forms creeping plants. It has yellowish-green, lanceolate, or ensiform (sword-shaped), leaves, that are glaucous. The basal leaves, can grow up to between long, and about 1.3 cm wide. The herbaceous leaves (die in the winter), sheath the stem. It has a round (in section) stem, or peduncle, that can grow up to between , or tall. The stems are taller than the leaves, and at higher levels on the mountains, the plants are shorter. It is also shorter than Iris pallida. The stem has glaucous green and ensiform spathes (leaves of the flower bud). They are slightly flushed with purple, and before flowering, they become pale brown, (scarious) membranous, and papery, They are 2.5 cm long, and between wide. It has 2 short branches (or pedicels). The stems (and the branches) hold between 2 and 3 flowers, It can have up to 6 flowers, but normally has 3 flowers, in spring, between April to June, or May, to July. The small, scented flowers, are in diameter, come in shades of blue, from violet, blue-violet, deep purple, blue-purple, deep blue-purple, pale purple, deep blue, to mid-blue. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate or cuneate shaped, they are long and wide. In the centre of the falls, is a short, (16–30 mm,) thick row of small hairs (the beard), which is yellowish-white, bright yellow, or white with orange tips. The standards are a similar size to the falls. It has 2.5 cm long style branch, that is paler than the falls and standards, and has deltoid crests. It also has a six grooved, ellipsoid ovary, and a 0.6–0.8 cm long perianth tube. After the iris has flowered, it produces an ovoid seed capsule, that is long and 1 cm wide, with 3 sections, which contain 15–20 oval grey or yellowish seeds. Biochemistry In 1956, a karyotype analysis was carried out on 40 species of Iris, belonging to the subgenera Eupogoniris and Pogoniris. It found that 24-chromosome tall bearded species could e divided into 3 karyotypes of Iris pallida. Iris kashmiriana has 2 pairs of median-constricted marker chromosomes, Iris illyrica, Iris cengialti, and Iris imbricata, lastly Iris variegata, Iris reginae (later classified as a synonym of Iris variegata), and Iris perrieri all have no median-constricted chromosomes. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=24. Taxonomy It is commonly known as 'Iris del Cengio', 'Monte Cengio iris'. In Italy, it is known as 'Giaggiolo del Cengio Alto'. In Slovenia, it is known as 'Bohinj Iris', or 'Bòcje of lof'. In German, it is known as 'Rovereto Schwertlilie'. It is sometimes misspelt as Iris cengualti. The Latin specific epithet cengialti refers to a mountain or large hill 'Mount Cengialto' (also known as Monte 'Cengio Alto',), close to the town of Rovereto, in northern Italy. Confusingly, another mountain near Arsiero in the province of Vicenza (Veneto), is also known as Monte Cengio Alto. It was found by Francesco Ambrosi in 1854, on Monte Cengialto, It was then published as Iris cengialti by Ambrosi in Flora del Tirolo Meridionale Vol.1 (Fl. Tirolo Mer.) on page 643 in 1854, then fully published and described by A. Kerner in Österreichische Botanische Zeitschrift (Oesterr. Bot. Z.) Vol. 21, No.9, on pages 225–231 in September 1871. A. Kerner was then assigned the author of the name Iris cengialti, previously ascribed to Ambrosi. Iris pallida, Iris cengialti and Iris illyrica are all considered closely related but often given different taxonomic rank (by various authors Kerner, 1871; Ambrosi, 1854; Foster, 1886; Tommasini, 1875; Pampanini, 1909; Lausi, 1964; Mathew, 1981; Colasante, 1995: Terpin et al., 1996). In May 1886, Sir Michael Foster noted in Gardeners' Chronicle on pages554 and 555, that it had similarities with Iris pallida. William Rickatson Dykes in his book in 'Handbook of Garden Irises' in 1914, suggested that Iris cengialti and Iris pallida were connected and should be merged under Iris pallida. In 1939, Brian Mathew considered it to be a subspecies of Iris pallida. Then in Giorn. Bot. Ital. Vol.130 on page575 in 1996, Iris cengialti was classified as a synonym of Iris pallida subsp. cengialti. It is normally classified as Iris pallida subsp. cengialti,Elaine Nowick and thought to be a naturally occurring hybrid. In Slovenia, a form of the plant is called Iris cengialti vochinensis, or Iris pallida subsp. cengialti f. vochinensis. probably of Asia Minor origin, It was verified as Iris pallida subsp. cengialti by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 27 February 2002, and then updated on 1 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and listed on the Catalogue of Life as Iris pallida subsp. cengialti. Distribution and habitat Iris pallida ssp. cengialti, seen in Slovenia It is native to Europe. Range It endemic in the alpine region, on the Dolomites (mountain range).Erika Pignatti and Sandro Pignatti It is found in north east Italy, (within the region of Trentino, and Veneto) and (part of the former Yugoslavia), in Slovenia, (within the regions of Bohinj. and Istria). In Trentino, it has found on Monte Zugna (south of Rovereto), and Mount Brione. In Veneto, it can be found on Mount Summano, in the province of Belluno. Habitat It grows on the rocky mountain sides, on scree, in meadows, and dry grasslands. Usually on karst, or limestone soils. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. They can found in the Dolomites, with other plants including; alyssum ovirense, androsace villosa, centaurea haynaldii, crepis froelichiana subsp. dinarica, eritrichium nanum, euphorbia kerneri, geranium argenteum, leontodon berinii, lilium carniolicum, potentilla incana and thlaspi minimum. They also grow in the Belluno forests of Acer pseudoplatanus (Mount Maple) and Tilia platyphyllos (Lime tree) with other geophytes and Leontodon tenuiflorus (Dandelion insubrico), Knautia persicina, Globularia nudicaulis and Paeonia officinalis (Wild Peony). In Slovenia, in Bohinj, it grows in meadows with another rare plant, Linnaea borealis (twinflower). Conservation It is a rare plant, although locally it is abundant on the mountains, growing in masses, hanging onto relatively steep slopes. In Italy, it is listed as a protected species of regional interest (Annex B, LR 9/2007, Art. 96), and would be classed as 'vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List. Cultivation Seen at the Botanischer Garten München-Nymphenburg in Munich, Germany It is hardy to 0 °C. It prefers could grown in rich (in fertile loan,), well drained soil in full sun. It can be grown the rock garden. It is generally not attacked by pests and diseases. A herbarium specimen can be found at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division. They should be lifted every three or four years, after the flowers are over. The tuber can be divided, with the dead roots trimmed and removed. The remains can then be replanted in enriched soil (with added compost). The leaves should be cut back to half their length, to prevent wind rock. Hybrids and cultivars It has been used in hybridizing (or breeding programmes), and the hybrids that have Iris cengialti as a parent, can have multiple flowers, on average between 5 and 8. The branches are generally short on slender stems.Benjamin Yoe Morrison Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske ReferencesSources * Mathew, B. 1981. The Iris. 24.

Clements and Edith Schwartz Clements, was an American botanist and pioneer of botanical ecology who was the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Nebraska. She was married to botanist Frederic Clements, with whom she collaborated throughout her professional life. Together they founded the Alpine Laboratory, a research station at Pikes Peak, Colorado. Clements was also a botanical artist who illustrated her own books as well as joint publications with Frederic. Both Clementses were involved with the study of phytogeography, especially those factors determining the ecology of vegetation in particular regions, and they would be praised as \\"the most illustrious husband-wife team since the Curies.\\" It is impossible to entirely disentangle the work of each Clementses as they worked together during their noteworthy years. Early life and education Edith Gertrude Schwartz was born in 1874 in Albany, New York, to George and Emma (Young) Schwartz. Her father was a pork packer from Omaha, Nebraska. She was educated at the University of Nebraska (UNL), being elected to Phi Beta Kappa and gaining her A.B. in German in 1898. She was also a member of Kappa Alpha Theta.Kappa Alpha Theta, Vol. 22(2), January 1909, p. 164, Report of the Minneapolis, MN Alumnae Association: \\"It was our privilege in October to give a tea at the home of Mrs Birch in welcome to Edith Schwartz Clements of Rho chapter (University of Nebraska) whose brilliant husband has come to head the department of botany at the university. The guests included the wives of members of the faculty and also representatives from the alumnae chapters of the other women's fraternities.\\" She wrote her dissertation on \\"The Relation of Leaf Structure to Physical Factors\\" in 1904. Schwartz began her career as a teaching fellow in German at UNL (1898–1900). During this period, she met her future husband, Frederic Clements, a UNL botany professor who influenced the direction of her graduate studies. At the time, the Universities of Nebraska and Minnesota (where she would later teach) were centers for the study of phytogeography—the geographic distribution of plant species—and she chose to make this her area of specialization. She earned her doctoral degree in botany in 1904 (with a minor in Germanic philology and geology), becoming the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D. by UNL. Edith and Frederic married in 1899. Career A Clements illustration for her book Rocky Mountain Flowers (Plate 42). A Clements illustration for her book Rocky Mountain Flowers (Plate 28). After gaining her Ph.D., Clements got a job as an assistant in botany at the University of Nevada (1904–07), where Frederic was teaching. To raise money, they spent several summers collecting plant specimens and assembled the Herbaria Formationum Coloradensium, a valuable collection of some 530 specimens of Colorado mountain plants carefully annotated and supplemented by 100 photographs. It was issued in 1903 in 24 sets that were sold to scientific institutions. A few years later, they assembled another collection featuring some 615 specimens of cryptogams; this set was later (1972) issued in print form by the New York Botanical Garden. In 1909, Clements was hired as an instructor in botany by the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, where Frederic had been hired two years before to head up the botany department. In 1917, Frederic gave up teaching and began doing research funded by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. For many years thereafter, Carnegie Institution funding supported their joint research endeavors, and Clements was named a field assistant by the Carnegie Institution. Beginning in 1917, the Clementses spent the winters doing research at two Carnegie-funded research institutions: first at the Tucson Institute in Arizona, and then (starting in 1925) at the Coastal Laboratory in Santa Barbara, California. Throughout this period, their summers were spent at a botanical station they developed as a test site for plant acclimatization, Alpine Laboratory at Pikes Peak, Colorado. Clements served as instructor in botany for the Alpine Laboratory, and Frederic as director. They trained many botanists and ecologists at this lab during its four decades of activity, before it closed in 1940. They published jointly and individually, and Clements used her language skills to translate some of their books and articles into foreign languages. During the Dust Bowl years, Clements and Frederic drove around the Great Plains and Southwest, helping to encourage conservation measures to counter the destructive loss of farm and range land. Clements was a botanical artist and illustrated a number of their joint publications, such as Rocky Mountain Flowers (1914) and Flowers of Coast and Sierra (1928), as well as solo publications by Frederic, including Plant Succession (1916, which she also helped to compile), Adaptation and Origin in the Plant World: The Role of Environment in Evolution (1939), and Dynamics of Vegetation (1949). In 1916, the color plates from Rocky Mountain Flowers were issued as a stand-alone guidebook to 175 of the most striking flowers of the area under the title Flowers of Mountain and Plain. The novelist Willa Cather, an acute observer of nature and a friend of the Clementses, was a great admirer of their work. In a 1921 interview, Cather observed: \\"There is one book that I would rather have produced than all my novels. That is the Clements botany dealing with the wildflowers of the west\\" (by which she probably means Rocky Mountain Flowers). In 1960, at the age of eighty-six, Clements published a lively memoir, Adventures in Ecology: Half a Million Miles: From Mud to Macadam, in which she told the story of \\"two plant ecologists who lived and worked together.\\" It is extremely revealing in showing how many jobs Clements undertook in support of the couple's joint expeditions, ranging from chauffeur, mechanic, cook, and stenographer to photographer, artist, and botanist. Indeed, Frederic himself was of the opinion that Clements would have been ranked among the world's top ecologists had she spent less time assisting his career. Clements's wry style is evident in this account of the departure of one expedition: > Friendly neighbors stood around, offering advice, warnings and gloomy > prophecies as well as bets on the impossibility of finding space in one car > for the appalling number of things that seemed to be absolutely > indispensable for the venture. I won the bets for I had a diagram that > showed a 'place for everything' and finally I had 'everything in its place.' > That is, everything except a pile of sugared and buttered pancakes, left > from breakfast. Ginger had planned to have them for lunch, but there was > absolutely not a vacant spot for them, and when he wasn't looking I put them > on a shelf in the garage. Frederic retired in 1941 and died in 1945. Edith continued to work on their joint manuscripts and write articles until her death in La Jolla in 1971. Legacy and honors Clements was nominated for the Nebraska Hall of Fame in 2012. An archive at the University of Wyoming, the Edith S. and Frederic E. Clements Papers, comprises photographs from the period 1893–1944, field notes, scientific correspondence, manuscripts and scientific papers, and Edith's diaries for the period 1907–1966. In addition, the University of Nebraska has digitized a small collection of letters written by Clements to her family about a 1911 trip she and Frederic took to Europe to participate in an international meeting of botanists and ecologists. Now available online, they are written with Clements's signature eye for vivid detail and knack for storytelling.

A medieval singlewoman (also unmarried, unwed, spinster, husbandless, maiden) is a woman born between the 5th and 15th century (c. 400 AD – 1500) who did not marry. This category of singlewomen does not include widows or divorcees, which are terms used to describe women who were married at one point in their lives. During the Middle Ages, lifelong spinsters came from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds, though elite women were less likely to be single than peasants or townswomen.  Definition  One of the most influential women of her time, St. Hildegard of Bingen was able to make her mark on history without having to marry. Before 1800, the term \\"single women\\" is defined as women who lived without having married which includes women who would eventually marry in their lifetime and women who never would. The term \\"life-cycle single women\\" describes women who were single for the years between childhood and marriage. Women who were single for life fell under the category of lifelong single women. It is important to distinguish single women from virginal nuns, another group of husbandless women. Although unmarried, not all single women were celibate virgins and virginal nuns practiced very different lives than everyday single women. Widows also differed from single women, as they often had greater economic security and occupational opportunity. While widows and single women both lived without a spouse at some point in their lives, their lifestyles were very different and widows were often awarded more freedoms and opportunities.  Demographics  Demographers have much more information about the demographic history of singlewomen during the early modern and modern period than in the Middle Ages. In fact, there are no sources that offer explicit information on the demographics of singlewomen before the fourteenth century. > \\"Urban residence, poverty, and migration all raised the age at which women > married and prompted higher proportions of singlewomen. Great wealth, high > social status, and immobility tended to lower the age of marriage and > depress the number of singlewomen.\\" left  Medieval Europe  In medieval Europe, there was a geographic contrast in the proportions of singlewomen. In England in 1377, about one- third of adult women were singlewomen. In Florence city of Italy, in 1427, about one-fifth of adult women were single. In northern Europe, women often married in their mid-twenties. However, \\"singleness was more common, marriage occurred relatively late, and husbands and wives tended to be of roughly similar ages\\". Historians describe this marriage trend in northern Europe as the northwestern European marriage pattern, the trend involving \\"young, single people work[ing] as laborers or servants for a number of years, saving up money to establish a separate household, and thereby delaying marriage into their early or even mid-twenties\\". Women in southern Europe, specifically the Mediterranean regions of southern France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, usually married in their teens and early twenties. In the Mediterranean regions, the large majority of people married and wives were often much younger than their husbands. The early marriage pattern did not appear only in southern Europe, nor was it even most notable there. Among Hungarians, Greeks, Slavs, and Albanians marriage occurred earlier than anywhere west of the Hajnal line. If a woman living in southern Europe did not marry in her teens, she was often expected to join a nunnery.  Sex ratios  While geographic location influenced the proportions of singlewomen, climatic differences, cultural differences, sex ratios, economic fluctuations, social status, and religion also played a role. In terms of climatic differences, there may have been fewer singlewomen and earlier marriage in southern Europe due to the \\"high infant and child mortality in southern Europe where summer-related diseases have a noticeable virulent effect\\".  Economics  In regards to economic fluctuations, there tended to be more singlewomen in areas where there were more options for paid work. If a woman was suffering financially, she often resorted to early marriage, or remarriage if widowed. \\"Female prosperity inhibited marriage whereas general prosperity promoted it\\". Another factor that influenced the proportions of singlewomen was an individual's wealth and social status. Women from poorer classes often married later than women from wealthier classes, as they had to accumulate sufficient dowries. Generally, noblewomen married at the youngest ages.  Urban vs rural  While there tended to be more singlewomen in northern Europe than in southern Europe, there were also more singlewomen in towns and cities than in the countryside. This phenomenon is likely due to the fact that there were more opportunities for female employment in urban areas. Singlewomen may have been much more prevalent in cities because sex ratios were more equal in rural areas. As there tended to be more women than men in urban areas, lifelong singlewomen were often more abundant in urban areas.  Culture and religion  Cultural differences also influenced the number of singlewomen in a particular region. For example, in Mediterranean communities, there was an emphasis on the \\"sexual purity of women as a reflection of family honor\\" that may have led to early and near-universal marriage. Religion also played a role in the marriage patterns of women. Jewish women often married in their teens, which was generally earlier than the age at which Christian women got married. Furthermore, lifelong singlewomen were very rare in Jewish communities. In Islamic religions, women often married at a very young age, as they did not need to provide a sufficient dowry.  Reasons for singlewomen in the Middle Ages = Migration  Towns and cities were particularly attractive to young women in the Middle Ages who hoped to discover greater financial opportunities or escape customs that gave preference to men. As such, the number of women within the migrant community exceeded that of men and towns began to experience skewed populations in favor of women. Migrant women were usually poorer than town natives and often had to work for many years to earn a dowry. Even still, marriage was not always guaranteed and non-natives tended to experience longer periods of poverty and singlehood than women born in urban areas.  Insufficient dowry  The dowry practice in the Middle Ages, which involved the exchange of wealth and gifts among families at the time of marriage, was incredibly important to the economic success of the new couple. Medieval families understood that such resources were necessary for the couple, namely the husband, to establish a home and pursue a career, trade or business opportunity. Even the poorest families were expected to provide a dowry on behalf of their daughter and if they could not, their daughter was not usually wed. This class of unwed women often performed years of contract labor to earn an eventual dowry, marrying much later in life, or served as a domestic servant without the option to ever do so.  Forced monasticism  Securing advantageous marriages was essential for elite women in the Middle Ages. But for elite women who did not marry, monasticism became the only viable option. Even among elites, large families who had to provide multiple dowries may have also chosen to send a daughter to a convent as a way to lessen the financial burden. Though singlehood was a part of being a nun, it is crucial to note that their experiences are not representative of the majority of unmarried women living in the Middle Ages.  Sex, sexuality and spinsterhood = \\"Simple fornication\\" and personal choice  Unlike men, singlewomen risked ruining their family's reputation if they wanted to engage in sexual activity outside the contexts of marriage. By the mid-late Middle Ages, the prospect of an independent woman came under increased scrutiny. The prevailing belief was that sex between two unmarried individuals was sinful and expressly forbidden. While many lifelong singlewomen were sexually active, it is unclear as to what percentage of the population this entailed. Medieval historians were also more likely to classify voluntary sex as prostitution, regardless of whether or not money was exchanged. > \\"In medieval Europe with its strict classification of women as virgins, > wives, and widows, any woman who did not fit into one of three categories > risked being equated with member of the only identifiable, demarcated group > that did not fit: prostitutes.\\" Reasons why women would choose spinsterhood over marriage: * Preferred a temporary or vague union * Little to no economic incentives * Familial and socioeconomic pressure By the latter half of the Middle Ages, the pressure to marry (as described in canon law) grew. As a result, the choice to remain single became increasingly less and less attractive. An independent woman, both symbolically and financially, threatened the established patriarchy. This marked a shift in the perception of singlewomen that followed them into the early modern era. > \\"Strong and healthy single women under the age of fifty were forbidden to > rent houses or rooms, but to go into service; women with a bad reputation > were to be evicted by their landlords. Such regulations were a further > pointer to women's worsening employment prospects in the early modern > period.\\"  Same-sex relationships  Throughout history, homosexual relationships have blossomed between women. While lesbianism was not a definitive characteristic of lifelong spinsters, there were women who fit into this category. Li livres de jostice et de plet(z) (\\"The Book of Justice and of Pleas\\") is an Old French legal treatise compiled in 1260. It is known as one of the first books on record that equates lesbianism with male homosexuality. As such, the Middle Ages marked a change in the way the church viewed and punished female same-sex relationships.  Prostitution  Singlewomen who couldn't make ends meet would often resort to prostitution if they could not find other means of work. But it is hard to distinguish how prostitution was defined in medieval Europe, namely because it can be found it referenced in regard to both commercial and casual sex. However, surviving documents indicate an awareness of the economic circumstances that led women to sell themselves by those in positions of power. > \\"That canon lawyers and theological writers found no difference between a > prostitute and a sexually active woman morally does not mean that they did > not recognize that the sex trade was a business. They wrote about under what > circumstances it was legitimate for a prostitute to take money. The twelfth- > century Parisian scholar Peter the Chanter and his associates Stephen > Langton, Robert Courson, and Thomas of Chobham said that a prostitute did > not have to make restitution of her ill-gotten gains. Chobham even argues > that the prostitute was entitled to a reasonable wage for her sexual > services.\\" While prostitution was considered lewd and sinful by the church, it is possible that the average person didn't stigmatize prostitutes in the same way. Trial records provide the most concrete examples, with prostitutes being called upon to provide crucial testimony in cases of impotence. By the late medieval period, prostitution became regulated in ways it had never been before, relegating working women to particular districts and manners of dress. > \\"Prostitution waxed and waned in the Middle Ages for reasons never > satisfactorily explained. Moral fashions notwithstanding, the major impetus > for dramatic increases in prostitution at certain periods in particular > countries may have depended upon economic competition with men.\\"  Economic opportunities  thumb  Peasant women  Peasant women, who lived and worked on manors, comprised the largest group of working women in the Middle Ages. Most peasant women wed at some point, and their manual labors were shared with their husbands. Manorial records indicate that many unmarried women held land on the manor, just as men, and were required to perform the same amount of labor to retain their tenancy. Without the option to divide their labors, singlewomen became one of the hardest working groups within the peasant community. Though few roles existed exclusively for women, the dairymaid or \\"daye\\" became a popular position for women to earn wages on the manor. The rise in popularity, along with the gendered connotation of the daye, can be attributed to the preference for hiring women laborers. Even if the manor did not produce dairy, work could be found for a daye, since women's low wages saved the manor money. If a woman could not find work as a dairymaid, her labors were permitted during the harvest season. Manorial records indicate that aside from plowing, which earned a higher wage, women participated in all stages of the harvest. Still, a woman was limited by lower wages and could not participate in the harvest of grain, which paid considerably more. Given the widespread discrepancy in earned wages and the limited window of seasonal availability, unmarried peasant women struggled to maintain financial security.  Townswomen  The migrant influx that drew large numbers of women to towns and cities made it difficult for many women to find a husband among the much smaller population of men. The number of unmarried women in these areas rose quickly as a result, and work became the primary outlet for lower class women to earn a living. Certain occupations were more available to singlewomen during the early Middle Ages, but restrictions imposed in the later Middle Ages decreased the economic opportunities for singlewomen greatly. Throughout the Middle Ages, social status was a considerable factor in the type of work a townswoman was eligible to perform. At the lowest end of the spectrum were domestic workers and servants whose physical labors were comparable to that of peasant women in rural areas. Servants were usually migrants from peasant families in the country, and wealthy families could contract their labors for many years. Servant labor was largely domestic, but those who did well could also assist their employer in their place of work. Even though their training was comparable to an apprenticeship, these women were unable to take up the trade professionally. For a singlewoman of slightly higher status, her unused dowry might cover the fees necessary to enter an apprenticeship. Singlewomen could sometimes be apprenticed to women who were already practicing their own craft, though this became increasingly rare. Once guilds were established in the later Middle Ages, however, it became nearly impossible for women to enter certain trades. As a result, the trades that did not have professional guilds, like textile manufacturing and the sale of edible goods, became the most accessible options for singlewomen. Even still, apprenticeships within these trades were difficult to acquire and were not given formal representation in official records. If a woman was lucky enough to acquire such an opportunity, it was nearly impossible to advance professionally within the trade. Regardless of their trade or craft, the majority of these women retained low status and remained poor for most of their lives. The economic difficulties that guilds imposed on unmarried women led many to enter the retail industry. These women were referred to as hucksters, earning a living by buying and selling a variety of edible goods. Without a husband to help them travel, however, hucksters were limited to sales within the town marketplace. Hucksters were regularly accused of reselling goods at prices deceitfully higher than market value. Those accused were referred to as \\"regraters\\" and were not highly respected by city officials.  Elite women  For women of noble status, marriage was an assumed fate. If an elite woman did not marry, or her parents could not support her dowry, a monastic life was her only option. For this reason, elite women who remained unmarried for life were practically unheard of.

Since South Carolina joined the SEC, they have met only four times. Notable games * 1900: NC State (then known as the Agricultural & Mechanical College of North Carolina) and South Carolina first met in November 1900, playing two games against each other that month. South Carolina won both games by a combined score of 29 to 5. * 1927: NC State and South Carolina played on Thanksgiving Day. NC State under head coach Gus Tebell crushed South Carolina, 34–0, to clinch a Southern Conference title. * 1928–1932: NC State and South Carolina scheduled their annual game as the last game of the season for both teams. * 1933: South Carolina defeated NC State, 14–0, as the undefeated Gamecocks won their first Southern Conference championship. * 1957: NC State defeated South Carolina, 29–26, to clinch the Wolfpack's first ACC championship. Dick Christy scored all 29 points for NC State. South Carolina scored to tie the game at 26 with 1:09 left. NC State drove down the field, but South Carolina intercepted a pass and returned it 63 yards. The crowd in Columbia streamed onto the field, but the interception was negated by a pass interference call. The penalty gave NC State the ball at the 30-yard line with time for one more play. Christy then kicked a field goal to give NC State the victory and the conference championship. * 1966: The two teams met for the first game in NC State's Carter–Finley Stadium. South Carolina spoiled the celebration in Raleigh, defeating the Wolfpack, 31–21. * 1972: In their first homecoming game under head coach Lou Holtz, the Wolfpack defeated the Gamecocks, 42–24. NC State went on to win all four games against South Carolina during Holtz's tenure as head coach from 1972 to 1975. * 1980: South Carolina's George Rogers rushed for 193 yards on 26 carries as the Gamecocks won, 30–10. After the game, South Carolina coach Jim Carlen said: \\"I have never seen a running back like Rogers. If he's not the best player in America, I'd like to see who is. George Rogers is All-World.\\" Rogers went on to win the 1980 Heisman Trophy. * 1984: South Carolina stays undefeated during their \\"Black Magic\\" season, coming from 12 points down to win in the final minute on a 6-yard Thomas Dendy TD carry. * 1989: Both teams came into the 1989 game ranked in the AP Poll. The Wolfpack won, 20–10. South Carolina quarterback Todd Ellis sustained an injury in the game that ended his collegiate football career. * 1991: With South Carolina accepting an invitation to join the SEC, the Gamecocks dropped the annual match with the Wolfpack, and the 1991 game was the last regular annual meeting. NC State quarterback Geoff Bender passed for two touchdowns and ran for a third, as the #19-ranked Wolfpack won, 38–31. In its account of the game, the Associated Press noted that the game marked the end of a rivalry: \\"In a football rivalry that began in 1900 and ended Saturday, North Carolina State's win brought the series with South Carolina to a 25–25–4 deadlock.\\" * 1999: The two teams met after a seven-year hiatus. The game was Lou Holtz's first as head coach of South Carolina after having been the head coach at NC State from 1972 to 1975. In a game played in torrential rain and high wind from a tropical storm, NC State spoiled Holtz's debut, defeating the Gamecocks, 10–0, giving them a 26–25–4 series lead. * 2017: The two teams met on a neutral field for the first time in the Belk Kickoff Game. Leading up to the game, NC State was favored and expected to beat South Carolina, who had gone 6-7 the previous year. On the kickoff, South Carolina wide receiver and kick returner Deebo Samuel returned the opening kick for a touchdown.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EdW8Qgy0mc0 He would have two other touchdowns, including a one-handed grab in the third quarter that would lead to a South Carolina 35-28 upset over the Wolfpack.

Milada was intended to be demolished in the 1980s and thus deleted from the cadastre, becoming a house which officially did not exist. It became one of the Czech Republic's best known squats, occupied from 1997 until 2009. It was then reoccupied for a day in 2012. Acting as a self-managed social centre and infoshop hosting concerts and events, Milada was also home to a number of people. Despite various plans for the site, as of 2019, the building was standing derelict.  History  Milada is a First Republic villa located in the Libeň district of Prague, next to two blocks of flats (Kolej 17. listopadu) housing university students. As part of plans for its demolition, Milada had been removed from the cadastre. Left derelict in 1988, Milada was occupied in 1997, along with the neighbouring villa, Miluška.  Social centre  alt=Exterior of Miluška The self-managed social centre was used as an infoshop, a bicycle repair workshop, a cafe, a meeting space and a venue for punk gigs and experimental music. A Food Not Bombs collective cooked out of the building, which also housed people. Milada was raided twice by the police in the summer of 1998 and was also attacked by representatives of the owner. In October 1998, a private security firm attempted to evict the building but was repelled, with two squatters remaining on the roof for four days. The security guards trashed the house but were unable to evict it. Students from a nearby housing block strung a line of rope across so that they could supply the occupiers with food and drink. Originally occupied as a \\"Point of Free Culture and Resistance\\", the project quickly changed to a new community. Over time, the number of events being organised declined and then in 2007, a new collective emerged. Milada had become one of the longest-lasting and well- known squats in the Czech Republic, alongside Ladronka. In March 2009, the building was re-registered by the owner the Institute for Information in Education (ÚIV), as a first step before selling it. The eviction in 2009 became a controversial story in the mainstream media.  Post-eviction  Protests were held in other Czech cities and in Prague a former spa was occupied in Albertov. The occupation was evicted the next day, with over 70 arrests. The people who had gone inside the building were charged with trespassing and in 2011 the charges were dropped. After the eviction, Michael Kocáb (Minister for Human Rights and Minorities) offered the squatters a place to stay at Truhlářská Street in the Old Town. This became known as Truhla, hosting events until June 2010. A party at Milada to mark three years since the eviction was broken up by the police on June 30, 2012. A helicopter and 100 police arrested 25 people for various offences. In 2015, there was a debate in the media as the Supreme Administrative Court considered an appeal regarding the legality of the eviction of Milada. Charles University had planned to set up a small campus at Milada, but failed to transfer the ownership of the building from the Institute for Information in Education in 2010. After the eviction, the university tried again, without success. As of 2019, the building was still standing derelict. Now owned by the Office of Government Representation in Property Affairs (ÚZSVM), there were no plans to restore the villa.

Madigan is a historian of Christianity who has taught at Harvard University since 2000. A member of the Faculty of Divinity, he has also served on Harvard's Committee on the Study of Religion, the Medieval Studies Committee, and the Center for Jewish Studies. Since 2009, Madigan has been Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History in Harvard Divinity School, an appointment offered by then-Dean of HDS, William Graham, and officially approved by Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust. He has been married for over thirty years to Stephanie Paulsell, Susan Shallcross Swartz Professor of the Practice of Christian Studies at HDS. They have one child, Amanda P. Madigan, a student at Harvard Law School Harvard Law School . In the summer of 2020, Madigan and Paulsell were appointed Faculty Deans of Eliot House, one of twelve undergraduate residences of Harvard College.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/11/college-ten-new-faculty- deans/ Education Ph.D, The University of Chicago Divinity School, 1992, M.A., The University of Chicago Divinity School], 1985, M.A., University of Virginia (English Language and Literature), 1984, B.A., magna cum laude, College of the Holy Cross (English Language and Literature), 1982 Areas of specialization and early career Madigan trained in medieval Christianity at the University of Chicago under Bernard McGinn. While at Chicago, Madigan took courses with Professor Jon D. Levenson, with whom, after Madigan joined the Harvard faculty, he would collaborate in publication and in the editing of the journal Harvard Theological Review. After taking his doctorate, Madigan also trained at the Summer Institute on the Holocaust and Jewish Civilization, then held annually under the direction of Peter Hayes and sponsored by Chicago's Holocaust Educational Foundation. The following summer, he studied under the then-dean of American Holocaust scholars, the late Raul Hilberg at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. In 1994, Madigan took his first \\"ladder\\" job as Assistant Professor of Church History at Catholic Theological Union (CTU) in Chicago; he would be tenured there in the Spring of 1999. While on the faculty of CTU, Madigan came under the influence of distinguished scholars, such as Robert Schreiter, Zachary Hayes, Donald Senior, John Pawlikowski, and Carolyn Osiek. He would collaborate in publications with several of these colleagues even after leaving Chicago for Cambridge in the Summer of 1999. Publications With Professor Senior, he collaborated on the introductory material to Oxford University Press' Catholic Study Bible, writing an essay on the reception and interpretation of the Bible in the Catholic Church, c. 200–2000 CE, and with Professor Osiek he would, after leaving CTU, soon collaborate on a book on women and ordained office in Early Christianity. While Osiek handled the Greek texts, Madigan translated and commented on all extant Latin texts, including inscriptions, c. 100–66. The same year Ordained Women appeared, Antisemitism: An Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, edited by Richard Levy, and of which Madigan was associate editor, was published. Finally, with Pawlikowski, he published his first article on the Holocaust, based on the eleven volumes of the Actes and Documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale ed P. Blet et al. A later version of this article, revised for popular consumption, would be published in 2001, entitled \\"What the Vatican Knew about the Holocaust, and When.\\" The article inaugurated a long and fruitful relationship between Madigan and Commentary, for which he would publish articles in 2010 on Popes Pius XI and XII, in 2010 on the use made by \\"Nazis on the Run\\" of the Vatican's Pontifical Aid Commission\\", and in 2014 on the Vatican's relationship with the government of Benito Mussolini. This, in fact, was a review-essay of David Kertzer's Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"double-biography of Mussolini and Pope Pius XI.* Madigan would later publish a review defending the distinguished Brown University historian, author of the brilliant and critically acclaimed The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, (about to be made into a movie by Stephen Spielberg) in the New York Review of Books after a book- length critique of Kertzer's study The Popes against the Jews: The Vatican's Role in the Rise of Modern Antisemitism, a volume that had been translated into nine languages, had been published. Madigan's Chicago dissertation, on the influence of Joachim of Fiore and of controversies surrounding the \\"Spiritual Franciscans\\" on commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew in the high Middle Ages, especially that written by Peter Olivi (1248–98), was published in revised form in 2003. Madigan talks about his first book in a published interview with an HDS journalist. His first articles were on biblical interpretation, scholastic thought and Christology in the High Middle Ages. Later gathered together and augmented by several other essays, they would form the core of a book, entitled \\"The Passions of Christ in the High Middle Ages: An Essay on Christological Development (Oxford University Press, 2007) on the intertwined issues of biblical exegesis, scholastic thought, and the issue of dogmatic \\"continuity\\" in Christian tradition. In the years 2009–2011, Madigan began to collaborate in several respects with his former teacher, close friend and HDS colleague, Jon D. Levenson, a fruitful collaboration that continues to this day. After publishing his award-winning book Resurrection and the Restoration of Israel, Levenson, at the request of his editor at Yale University Press, co-authored with Madigan a book on the Jewish roots and Christian appropriation of the idea of resurrection in Second Temple Judaism. In 2010, the two would take over as co-editors of Harvard Theological Review, as their dear friend and colleague, François Bovon, grew more and more ill before his death in 2013. In 2015, Madigan published Medieval Christianity: A New History, also published by Yale University Press. It has received generally positive reviews. Francis Oakley wrote in Commonweal that \\"Madigan's book can be said to convey a picture of medieval Christianity that is no less lively for being well-informed and carefully balanced. It can be recommended without reservation to any interested reader.\\" Rachel Fulton Brown wrote that it is \\"a masterful yet accessible introduction to the principal institutional, intellectual, and social developments of medieval Christianity, including the papacy and religious orders, particularly valuable for its attention to the place of Jews, Muslims, heretics, and women in these developments, as well as the problem of educating the laity.\\" Madigan finished the book after serving as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Faculty for two years at HDS, working with and for his colleague in history, Dean David Hempton. Madigan is now working on a book, based on the rich resources of the Vatican, Jesuit, and Central State Archives in Rome, on the relationship between Protestants and Catholics during the Fascist period in Italy. Entitled The Pope against the Protestants: Evangelical Christians and the Vatican in the Fascist Period in Italy, the book will be published by Yale University Press in 2021. Film reviews Madigan has published a number of film reviews, usually on movies that treat themes that he, too, is interested in: the history of antisemitism, the Holocaust, the Second World War, the history of Christian thought, Christian defiance of evil in war, and the joy, motivations, and power of teaching. He has reviewed Michael Radford's filmic presentation of The Merchant of Venice, concentrating on the performance history of the play in Nazi Germany. His ongoing admiration for religiously motivated heroism in times of great risk, as well as his fondness for a well-told story of inspiration that is also based on fact, led him to compose an appreciative review of Marc Rothemund's Sophie Scholl: The Final Days. He paired this review with Sebastian Dehnhardt's heartbreaking Stalingrad, where we see Hitler's fanatical will is not enough to overcome poor planning, low supplies, weather, hubris or a determined Red Army. Here we see the influence on Madigan of his favorite writer on war, the late Paul Fussell. The subject of will came up again in a review of the filmic transformation of Philip Dick's noirish short story The Adjustment Bureau. Here Madigan, in contemplating the philo- theological issues of free will and determinism expressed in the film, launches his reflections with the following limerick: There once was an old man who said, \\"Damn! It is borne in upon me I am An engine that moves In determinate grooves, I'm not even a bus, I'm a tram.\\"—Maurice Hare, \\"Limerick\\" (1905) From there, Madigan argues that the film presses neither a hard determinism nor a soft freedom, but a via media between these two extreme positions. Teaching Madigan's pedagogical reflections have centered on the perils, promises and purposes—even the possibilities—of teaching the Holocaust. This was the subject of an article entitled, \\"Putting a Face on the Six Million,\\" which addresses the issue of when numbers become abstract statistics and even piles of corpses lose their power to move. The talk, later published as an article, was covered by Harvard journalists, one of whom published an essay in the Harvard Gazette, the official news outlet of Harvard University as an article entitled, \\"When the Intellectual and Spiritual Intersect: HDS Professor Talks Candidly about How He Was Inspired to teach the Holocaust.\\" The article concludes by quoting Madigan's concluding expression of eschatological hope: \\"I imagine the victims' physical and emotional wounds healed; the loss of their brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers restored; their deaths swallowed up forever by the God who keeps his promises, who loves, and who has never forgotten his people. … I imagine the joy and gladness of these innocents with every tear wiped away forever.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Harvard Divinity School faculty Living people American historians of religion Harvard University faculty College of the Holy Cross alumni University of Virginia alumni Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kevin J.

The Pomeranian Philharmonic is the musical center of Kujawy-Pomerania Province and also features an outdoor art gallery. It is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. Location The seat of the Pomeranian Philharmonic is located in downtown Bydgoszcz, in the center of the \\"Music District\\". It is surrounded by Jan Kochanowski Park, music schools, and an outdoor gallery of sculptures of composers and virtuoso musicians. Characteristics The Pomeranian Philharmonic is a cultural institution which bodies are under the authority of leading Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship. Performances include symphonic concerts, chamber music, and recitals by virtuosos from all over the world. On stage Philharmonic concerts are accompanied by Polish or foreign groups, to play at the occasion of jubilees, commemorations and congresses organized by universities and private companies. The repertoire includes music of all periods, from medieval to contemporary works. The acoustics of the concert hall of the Pomeranian Philharmonic is famous for its quality: concert recordings of classical and contemporary music are often performaed there. In 2010, the Pomeranian Philharmonic has carried out in their hall 360 concerts, gathering an audience of 79200 people. The first director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic was, from 1953 to 1991, Andrzej Szwalbe, who made the orchestra of Bydgoszcz a recognized scene in Europe. Since 1991, director is Eleonora Harendarska. History=Municipal Symphony Orchestra The first initiative related to set up a Pomeranian Philharmonic was the creation of a local Symphony Orchestra able to perform at a high artistic level: in 1922, one the section of Bydgoszcz's Music Society had an orchestra section under the direction of Zygmunt Urbanyi. However, despite strenuous efforts, no symphony ensemble has been created in the 1920s. In 1924, the Pomeranian Philharmonic Society was an entity consisting of bands from Bydgoszcz, Grudziadz and Torun. In 1925, an initiative to establish an Orchestra of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Society, composed of professional musicians, failed for public foundings reasons. In this situation, the Bydgoszcz Music Society, until 1930, was the only body organizing regular performances: * outstanding Polish and foreign artists, * local military bands, * Bydgoszcz Conservatoire of Music, conducted by Wilhelm von Winterfeld, * bands from other cities, such as the orchestra of the Grand Theatre of Poznań. In January 1936, on the initiative of voluntary musicians, the Bydgoszcz symphony orchestra has been created, soon directed by Wilhelm von Winterfeld. The inaugural concert of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra has been held on May 8, 1936 \\"Strzelnicy Hall\\" in Toruńska street. The following year, the orchestra was led by Alfons Rezler, a professor of the Municipal Conservatoire of Music, providing the basis for its organization. In 1938, the Bydgoszcz's Music Society took over the patronage of the orchestra, and the Municipality provided a considerable assistance to the team. World War II and the years of occupation have destroyed these achievements: Alfons Rezler died during the invasion of Poland, many musicians were killed or fled abroad. Pomeranian Symphony Orchestra In 1946, to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the foundation of Bydgoszcz, a new formation, close to the pre-war Symphony Orchestra of the Music Society of Bydgoszcz was created by Arnold Rezler, Jerzy Jasieński, Felicja Krysiewicz and chaired by Witold Miller. It gave its first concert on May 12, 1946, in the hall of the Pomorski House of Arts in Gdańska Street. From 1946 to 1949, the Music society of Bydgoszcz set up the foundations of the organisation and the material, with few interference of the city. During this period the orchestra was called Pomeranian Symphony Orchestra' of the Bydgoszcz Music Society. Public concerts were held four times a month, with additional ones in schools of Bydgoszcz and of the Voivodeship. Already at that time, initiatives to invite eminent conductors (Witold Rowicki and Bohdan Wodiczko and soloists started (Stanisław Szpinalski, Zbigniew Drzewiecki, Regina Smendzianka, Kazimierz Wiłkomirski, Wanda Wiłkomirska). Conducting Orchestra, among others, . In 1949, Mieczyslaw Tomaszewski was nominated as new director: he organized three series of concerts related to Frédéric Chopin (for the centenary of the composer's death), and presented a series of concerts \\"Music for All\\" in 26 cities of the Voivodeship. The orchestra was nationalized in November 1950. On September 1, 1951, Andrzej Szwalbe became director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Orchestra. He soon championed the project of the construction of a specific building for the Philharmonic, to move out of the Pomorski House of Arts in Gdańska Street. Main conductors at this time were, among others Edward Bury, Tadeusz Wilczak or Robert Satanowski. The inaugural concert of the new symphony orchestra of the State Pomeranian Philharmonic took place on January 9, 1953, in the hall of the Polish Theatre. In September 1955, the orchestra of the National Pomeranian Philharmonic, numbering 65 musicians, was augmented by disbanded musicians from the Bydgoszcz Polish Radio Orchestra. In the same year the name of the institution was changed to Ignacy Jan Paderewski Pomeranian Philharmonic, earning the esteem of more and more talented graduates of music schools. In 1971, the philharmonic counted more than 100 people. Many of the orchestra musicians began working in music schools of Bydgoszcz and Torun. On November 15, 1958, the orchestra performed its first concert in the brand new building of the Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz. Pomeranian Philharmonic In September 1951, Andrzej Szwalbe has been appointed director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Orchestra, which was nationalized in December 1952: on January 1, 1953, the orchestra was renamed National Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz. Already in February 1953, attempts to have a new philharmonic concert hall have been made, and thanks to the efforts of the Social Committee for the Philharmonic Building, on June 26, 1954 the ceremony laying the foundation stone of the edifice at Libelta street 16 happened. The construction was completed in autumn 1958: the new building was spacious, had a convenient location, and most of all have a concert hall with rare acoustic conditions. On November 16, 1958 a gala concert marking the opening of the new building was held, led by Zbigniew Chwedczuk. During the following days an occasional music festival took place, with concerts were in Bydgoszcz, Torun and Włocławek. At the same time, the Philharmonic was christened Ignacy Jan Paderewski, whose half-brother Józef lived in Bydgoszcz from 1926 until his death in 1958. Thanks to Andrzej Szwalbe's work, 1961 was the year of the first musical event on a national scale, the \\"Ignacy Jan Paderewski International Piano competition\\" (). Since then, each year is organized a \\"Bydgoszcz Music Festival\\". The exceptional acoustic of the concert hall drew to Bydgoszcz best artists from all around the world,Puto Maciej: Festiwal gwiazd. Kalendarz Bydgoski 2003 among others, Witold Małcużyński (1959), Arthur Rubinstein (1960), David Oistrakh (1961), Benjamin Britten (1961), Sviatoslav Richter (1963), Arthur Moreira Lima (1965), Bernard Ringeissen (1965), Ruggiero Ricci (1969), Garrick Ohlsson (1973), Grigori Zhislin (1977), Eugen Indjic, Vadim Brodsky, Stanislav Bunin (1986), Halina Czerny-Stefańska, Maurizio Pollini, Wanda Wiłkomirska, Teresa Żylis-Gara, Krystian Zimerman, Konstanty Andrzej Kulka, George Byrd, Shlomo Mintz, Mischa Maisky, Kevin Kenner, Kurt Masur, Kazimierz Kord, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Antoni Wit. Among the conductors, we one can mention: Leopold Stokowski (1960), Aram Khachaturian (1962), Carlo Zecchi (1967), Emil Gilels (1967), Arvīds Jansons. In 1964, Luciano Pavarotti, still unknown, performed here. The Symphonic Orchestra toured well-known orchestra hall worldwide, like New York City, Beijing, Paris, Berlin or Moscow. In 1962 at the Philharmonic was founded the ancient music ensemble, named Capella Bydgostiensis: the band performs songs of old masters, earning the recognition of amateurs of ancient music in Poland and abroad. In 1966, Andrej Szwalbe organized, in cooperation with the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society and the Department of Musicology of the University of Warsaw, the first festival of ancient music \\"Musica Antiqua Europae Orientalis\\". Happening every three years, it is now a well-known event in the worldwide musical life. From 1963 to 1967, the Pomeranian Philharmonic hosted the Festival of Polish Music, later revamped into \\"Bydgoszcz Music Festival\\". As a homage to his major contributions to the development of the Philharmonic and his outstanding cultural role, brought her longtime manager, Andrej Szwalbe has been nominated \\"Honorary Citizen of Bydgoszcz\\". Another of his realizations is the inception of the \\"music district\\", surrounding the building of the Philharmonic Music and comprising the Bydgoszcz Music Academy - \\"Feliks Nowowiejski\\" and the sculpture gallery of composers and virtuosos. On the front square of the Philharmonic has been built in the 1970s an organ- shaped fountain. Inside, the lobby is decorated with a collection of tapestries. Interiors are adorned with a collection of portraits and busts of prominent composers and an exhibition of historic pianos, as well as rich music library. Philharmonic building=History Pomeranian Philharmonic building has been built in the Polish vogue style in the 1940s and 1950s, which is a mix of functionalism, Neoclassical architecture, Renaissance architecture, Baroque architecture and Rococo. The external architecture reveals itself especially neoclassical, displaying seriousness and moderation to illustrate the social importance of the institutions housed there. The originator and effective executor of the building was director of the Philharmonic Andrzej Szwalbe. On March 24, 1953, the Presidium of the Provincial Council in consultation with the Central Board of Opera, Philharmonic Hall and Musical Institutions in Warsaw adopted a resolution allowing the construction of the building. Initial draft were prepared by a team led by the architect Jan Kossowki, who at the time already worked on several projects in Bydgoszcz (Freedom Monument, buildings in Jagiellońska street and Gdańska Street). Many locations were identified: People Park, Jan Kochanowski park, Copernicus square or Leszek the White square. The selected area was the location of former tennis courts at Słowackiego street. The jury, chaired by professor Piotr Biegański who co-led the reconstruction Old and New Town of Warsaw, elected the team headed by: * architect Stefan Klajbor (who realized a building in Jagiellońska street), * designer Bogdan Piestrzyński, * acoustics designer Witold Straszewicz of Warsaw University of Technology. Construction began in February 1954, under the supervision of Zbigniew Arciszewski from Gdansk University of Technology. The construction was financed by the \\"Social Reconstruction Fund of the Capital\\". The building site was twice inspected by a delegation of Soviet builders from Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science in September 1954 and January 1955. The building was erected using Polish building materials, with the help of Polish engineering and manpower. The interior decor was designed by a team of artists from Torun- Stefan Zarębski, Joseph Kozlowski and Jozef Kowalczyk-, wood panelling prepared by Bydgoszcs's Furniture Factory, railings by Blacksmith craftmen from Gdańsk and chandelier by Szklarska Poręba glassworks which provided chandeliers for Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science. A particular attention has been paid to concert hall acoustic. The main hall has an amphitheater slope. Over the stage, acoustic reflectors are placed on the back wall, and the whole interior is paneled in order to obtain balanced reverberation time through the entire frequency spectrum. Acoustic effects of this arena amazes even professionals. In a letter to the then Minister of Foreign Affairs Adam Rapacki, Andrzej Szwalbe stated: \\"acoustics were able to reach excellence. There is nothing to be ashamed of with regards to the East or the West [...] \\" East façade Architecture The building is an 18m high regular structure with dimensions of 35m by 45m, reminding willingly the features of the Warsaw Phiharmonic building rebuilt at the same period (1955). The main elevation is mounted on a pedestal. The central part of the frontage displays a two-storey high colonnade, joined at its bottom by baluster railings. Facades are topped with attic style cornices with wire mesh walls. Terraces are available between each facade colonnades. Inside are two concert halls: * the main one called \\"Arthur Rubinstein Hall\\" with an 880 seats capacity * a smaller one called \\"Mikołaj Zieleński hall\\" with 195 seats. Early in the 1950s, live broadcast occurred thanks to Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship radio resources, airing both intimate recordings, as well as great symphony orchestra concerts with a choir, with up to 300 people. Around the buildings are displayed sculptures, part of the outdoor monument gallery. The Pomeranian Philharmonic building has been registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List N°601376 Reg.A/269 on January 27, 1978 and December 18, 1981.zabytek-kujawsko- pomorskie-28.02.2014 Acoustics The main concert hall of the Pomeranian Philharmonic is classified as acoustically one of the best in Europe, as confirmed by well-known artists and music critics.Jerzy Waldorff described it as \\"miracle acoustic\\" hall In the background of the main concert hall is set up a mechanical organ produced by the firm Riger-Kloss from Krnov (Czech Republic). The chamber hall is equipped with an organ made by the establishment of Stefan Truszczyński from Włocławek. There is also a large collection of concert keyboards, pianos and harpsichords.

It is part of the first fortified belt forts of Metz and had its baptism of fire in late 1944 in the Battle of Metz.  Historical context  The first fortified belt consisted of Fort Saint-Privat (1870) Fort de Queuleu (1867), Fort des Bordes (1870), Saint-Julien (1867), Fort Gambetta, Fort Déroulède, Fort Decaen, Fort de Plappeville (1867) and Group Fortifications of Saint-Quentin (1867); most of them were unfinished or still in the planning stages in 1870, when the Franco-Prussian War broke out. During the period of German control following this war, Metz had a German garrison of 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of this period,. and housed more than 25,000 men before the First World War,. gradually becoming the most important stronghold of the German Reich.François Roth, \\"Metz annexée à l’Empire allemand\\", in François-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz (History of Metz), Toulouse, Privat, 1986, p.350  Construction and facilities  Fort Saint-Julien is located in the hills above Saint-Julien-lès-Metz and overlooks the city of Metz and the Moselle valley. The fort follows the spirit of the \\"detached forts\\" concept developed by Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières in France and Hans Alexis von Biehler in Germany. The goal was to form a discontinuous enclosure around Metz of artillery forts spaced a cannon shot apart. Work began in 1867. The fort was not complete in 1870, when war broke out between France and Germany. The defensive system was completed and perfected by German engineers between 1871 and 1891. The fort, pentagonal, is a bastion. Half buried behind a defensive system on a slope, the main casern is designed to withstand artillery fire. The fort is surrounded by a system of dry moats, evoking the fortifications of Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.  Successive assignments  While Alsace- Lorraine was under German control after the Franco-Prussian War, the fort became a training camp for German imperial troops. From 1890 the troops in the fort were provided by the XVI Army Corps stationed at Metz and Thionville. From 1914 to 1918, the fort served as a relay for German soldiers at the front line. Surrendered to the French army in 1919, the fort was re-taken twenty years later by the Germans during World War II. Beginning in September 1944, German troops reorganized its defense, and integrated the fort with the defensive system set up around Metz. After World War II, the fort was abandoned. Part of the fort now houses a restaurant specializing in dishes from Alsace and Lorraine.  Second World War  In late August 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of Metz, the German command integrated the defensive system set up around Metz. On 2 September 1944, Metz was declared a Hitler Reich fortress, to be defended to the last by German troops whose leaders were all sworn to the Führer.. The next day General Walther Krause, then commander of the fortress of Metz, established his High Command, the main command post in the barracks was Fort de Plappeville, then known as Feste Alvensleben. The same day, the troops of General Krause took position on a line from Pagny-sur- Moselle to Mondelange, passing to the west of Metz by Chambley-Bussières, Mars-la-Tour, Jarny and Briey. After an initial withdrawal, starting 6 September 1944, the German lines rested firmly on the forts of Metz. The US offensive, launched 7 September 1944 on the west line of the forts of Metz was cut short. American troops, stopped at the Moselle, despite taking two bridgeheads south of Metz, better defended than expected, were now low on supplies and figuratively out of breath. General Raymond McLain, in agreement with General Edwin Walker, decided to suspend the attack, pending new plans from the General Staff of the 90th Infantry Division.. When hostilities resumed after a rainy month, the soldiers of the still held firm to the forts of Metz, though supplies lines were more difficult under artillery fire and frequent bombings.. As a prelude to the assault on Metz, on 9 November 1944, the Air Force sent some 1,300 heavy bombers, both Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberators, and dumped hundreds of bombs on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of the Third Army.. As most bombers had no visibility and dropped their bombs from over 20,000 feet, the military targets were often missed. In Metz, 689 loads of bombs hit the seven forts identified as priority targets, but merely caused collateral damage.. In the morning fog of 18 November 1944, Colonel Donald Bacon gave the signal for the attack by the 2nd Battalion 378 Infantry Regiment on the Fort Saint-Julien. The fort's strong position on the main road from Metz was in fact an essential goal. The assault battalion silently encircled the fort and attacked at 7:00 am precisely. The road down to Metz was then held by a company of the 462 Volks-Grenadier-Division that the US artillery campaign finally dislodged from the houses below, completing the encirclement of the fort around noon. American tanks and self-propelled guns then took position around the fort. For an hour, the 240-mm howitzers of Task force fired tirelessly preparing for the infantry attack. The soldiers of the 378th Infantry Regiment then rushed through a gap at the back of the fort, under fire from machine guns. Two light tanks provide covering fire, while a tank destroyer took position near the entrance and shot at the fort, which nevertheless resisted. Finally, a self-propelled 155mm gun managed to break the door. In the absence of heavy weaponry, the 200 German soldiers of the 462nd Volks-Grenadier-Division were trapped in the fort and could do nothing against American firepower. The next morning, in the mist of 19 November 1944, the small detachment of 462 Volks-Grenadier-Division finally agreed to surrender to US troops.. The fort Jeanne-d’Arc was the last of the forts of Metz to disarm. Determined German resistance, bad weather, floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, have helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saar.. The objective of the German staff, which was to gain the most possible time in keeping the US troops from arriving at the front of the Siegfried Line, was largely achieved.

The club currently competes in the top division of the National Conference League soon to be in the national conference division 1. The club also operates an A team and an under 18s team; plus numerous junior teams. Now includes a successful Ladies side and Masters Section. History The club can trace its roots back to 1966, when players from Astley & Tyldesley linked up with the disbanded junior section from Hope Rangers to form the new club based at the Miners' Welfare Club on Twist Lane. Back then the team played in the Warrington League. The team moved into the North West Counties League in the 1970s and was successful in winning a record number of Premier Division titles. They also came close to the biggest Challenge Cup upset of all time, leading holders Warrington at Wilderspool with time running down, before a late score saw Wire progress. In 1986 the team became founder members of the National Conference League and remain one of only two sides never to have played outside the top division of the amateur game's flagship league. Early success was limited, although Miners won the short-lived Conference League Cup. In 1999, under coach Ian Taylor, a team including Richard Henare, Mark Meadows and Andy Collier beat the then-professional Bramley at Headingley in the Challenge Cup third round, but in the league the team were struggling until the appointment of former BARLA coach Warren Ayres in autumn 1999. Under Ayres, Miners reached the inaugural National Conference Grand Final in 2002, narrowly beaten by West Hull at Spotland, Rochdale, and since then Miners remain the only club to have appeared in all but one series of play-offs to date. In 2005 the team won the Grand Final, defeating Wath Brow Hornets at Orrell in what proved to be Ayres’ last game in charge. His assistant Winston Sarsfield took the helm, and guided the team to third place and the National Cup final in his first season. In 2006-07 with a team largely composed of graduates from the club's under-18s side including Scott O’Brien and Aaron Gorton, Miners claimed the Minor Premiership but lost out in the Grand Final to Skirlaugh. In 2008-09, with a team including eight players from the victorious under-18s side of 2007-08, the team maintained their record of appearing in every top six series of play-offs, and had a fourth-place finish. The season culminated with two players touring the South Pacific with the BARLA international side, another touring Ukraine with the under-23s and four players going on the youth tour of Australia. In 2009-10 the club maintained its record in the play-offs with a fifth-placed finish and also became the first amateur team to play on the new Leigh Sports Village ground. They were Treble Champions in 2015 led by joint coaches Paul Whitworth and Allan Coleman in the club's most successful season - Minor Premiers, Challenge Trophy Winners & Grand Final Champions. Coaches Paul Whitworth and Allan Coleman picked up the National Conference League Premier Division Coaches of the Year while long serving half back Scott O'Brien picked up the National Conference League Premier Division Player of the Year. During their tenure they picked up 5 Major trophies while having a record equaling run in the Challenge Cup Competition beating Semi-professional Oxford to the 5th Round. 2017 after the initial appointment of Jason Seddon the club were relegated to Division one. In 2018, under the stewardship of Dave Rowlands the club bounced back in to the Premier Division after defeating Milford Marlins in the play-off final with golden point try. The women's and girls teams continue to expand with 12s, 14, 16s and openage launched for the 2019 season.

It is based on the Eisenhower Method of arranging tasks by urgency and importance in a 2x2 matrix. Priority Matrix offers a cloud-based synchronization of data, allowing for data management across multiple devices. The application is also loosely based on David Allen's Getting Things Done methodology of improving productivity. Features * Quadrants-based task prioritization- The 2x2 time management matrix, based on the Eisenhower Method of time management, is the general framework on which Priority Matrix is run. The quadrants organize tasks based on importance and urgency. In Priority Matrix, the four quadrants' default labels are: Critical and Immediate, Critical but not Immediate, Not Critical but Immediate, and Uncategorized. * Task drag and drop- Tasks and projects are capable of being dragged from one location to another, allowing users to change a task's priority level without having to create a new item altogether. * Project import/export- Entire projects can be exported into the program's native file format, .pmatrix, for transferring a workspace quickly. * Cloud-based synchronization across platforms- Despite running on several different platforms, Priority Matrix is able to sync project and task data over the cloud, with data being stored on Priority Matrix's servers. * Progress and date tracking- Dates and deadlines can be made for each task, providing notifications and allowing users to track their progress over time. * Project summary emails and reporting- Emails can be created out of entire projects, for quick reporting and sending a summary of projects. * Color and label customization- Each quadrant's background can be changed to any color in the RGB spectrum. For further customization, every task has icons that can be selected to represent a specific task. * Template system- New projects can be created from sample templates, to avoid repetitive data input. Various templates are available for different thought processes. Reception Across the various platforms, Priority Matrix has over 90,000 paid customers, and has been ranked among the 10 highest downloaded productivity apps in the Apple App Store. PC Magazine has ranked the iPad version of Priority Matrix among its 100 Best iPad Apps in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In addition, the product has garnered a 4 out of 5-star rating or better on the Apple App Store on both the iPhone and iPad platforms, with over 1,300 reviews. An Android version was added to the Play Store September 2013. As of 2014, this version had an average rating of 3.9, with 1,000-5,000 installs.

History Fossil bird eggs from the Paleogene are rare in North America, and have only occasionally been examined microstructurally and compared to modern birds. The specimens that would later be name Microolithus were collected in 1940 by the paleontologist R. W. Wilson. In 2013, paleontologists from Montana State University Frankie D. Jackson and David J. Varricchio teamed up with Joseph A. Corsini from Eastern Oregon University to analyze these specimens, which they assigned to a new oogenus and oospecies, Microolithus wilsoni. This would be only the second oogenus of Paleogene bird egg to be named in North America (the first being Incognitoolithus). Distribution The known specimens of Microolithus were found in the Eocene Willwood Formation in Park County, Wyoming. Description Microolithus is, as its name suggests, a small egg; the smallest specimen is by . Like all medioolithids, it is roughly spherical. The eggshell is 600 μm thick, and its outer surface is smooth and glossy, but this may be due to erosion. Its eggshell is composed of three structural layers. The outermost layer (the external layer) contacts the middle layer (the continuous layer), abruptly. The continuous layer has squamatic texture obscuring the prism-shaped eggshell units. The innermost layer (the mammillary layer) makes up one-fourth of the eggshell's thickness, and has an abrupt but wavy boundary with the continuous layer. The eggshell has circular pores with a density of 1.08 per square millimeter. Some Mircoolithus specimens have embryonic remains of long bones and possibly vertebra, but no useful characteristics for determining which bones or to what bird group they belong are preserved. The periosteum of these bones is somewhat porous. Microolithus is very similar to modern bird eggs, even more so than Metoolithus and the other known Paleogene bird eggs. It closely resembles modern neognaths, especially the sandhill crane. Parataxonomy Because of the numerous similarities of Microolithus wilsoni to the German Medioolithus, they are classified together (along with Incognitoolithus) in the oofamily Medioolithidae.

It was located between Zunds and Daugavgrīvas streets, on modern Ūdens street of the northern side. The Muižeļi family lived in Daugava's Zunds since 17th century, Muižeļi were engaged in various occupations, including selling timber to England and other countries. By the end of 18th century, the Muižeļi family owned nine land plots. History The first known owner of the manor was Ansis Muiželis of Daugava's ferries and his son Albrecht Muiželis. Albrecht's first wife was Johann Steinhauer's sister Anna. Later the manor was owned by Albrecht's son - John Heinrich Muiželis, a merchant of Riga's second guild and court judge of Conscience. They also gave birth to Karl Justus Davis Muiželis, who became a professor of veterinary medicine at Vilnius University. In the late 18th century John Heinrich liquidated his company and purchased the estate in Vitebsk province, then moved to Vilnus province. The manor was inherited by his trade companion, an elder brother of Albrecht Muiželis from the first merchant guild. Napoleonic Wars caused blockades and the Muiželis family business suffered during the French invasion of Russia. After 1812, the manor was sold to Albrecht Muižeļis' assistant for 3000 silver rubles, the mast selector John Mesters' daughter - Juliana Frederick, because of her heritage the court invested into Muiželis' companies. Juliana was married to the civil governor's secretary from the Governorate of Livonia - J. von Meyer. After Meyer's death in 1841, the manor was passed to Riga's merchant A. M. Gorohova's property.

Lower bounds The bound of Erdős's theorem is tight up to constant factors for some small values of k: for k = 2, 3, or 5, there exist graphs with edges that have no -cycle. It is unknown for other than 2, 3, or 5 whether there exist graphs that have no -cycle but have edges, matching Erdős's upper bound. Only a weaker bound is known, according to which the number of edges can be for odd values of , or for even values of .

Background The Spike was developed in response to operational needs encountered during operations against asymmetric opponents. Guided missiles like the AGM-114 Hellfire fired from aircraft and FGM-148 Javelin used by infantry have disadvantages when used against insurgents in urban areas. They are both cost prohibitive at around $100,000 per missile, designed to be used against slow-moving heavily armored vehicles like tanks, while during the Iraq War they were employed against personnel and fast-moving unarmored vehicles. Also, because they are made to destroy heavy vehicles, they use large warheads that could inflict unnecessary collateral damage. The Spike was made to provide infantry with a shoulder-fired guided fire-and-forget missile system lighter and cheaper than the Javelin and produce light and more numerous weapons for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to carry.Smaller, Lighter, Cheaper - Defensenews.com, 31 May 2010U.S. Navy Develops EO Guided Spike - Defense-Update.com, 31 December 2010SPIKE Shoulder- Launched Fire-and-Forget Guided Missile Kills Fast-Moving Threats - Defensereview.com, 19 June 2006Navy develops 'world's smallest guided missile' - Navytimes.com, 23 February 2014More Killer Drone Bangs For The Buck - Wired.com, 9 October 2008 Design Spike was designed by the U.S. Navy, with assistance from DRS Technologies, and is proclaimed to be \\"the world's smallest guided missile.\\" Initially made to be carried by U.S. Marines, with three missiles and the launcher able to fit in a standard backpack, it weighs , is long, and in diameter. The warhead weighs about 1 lb (450 gr) and employs the Explosively Formed Projectile (EFP) effect, made to penetrate before detonating. It is powered by a small rocket motor that gives it a range exceeding . The missile is directed to its target by either an electro-optical (EO) or semi-active laser (SAL) seeker; the EO camera is similar to a basic cellphone camera, containing a 1-megapixel video camera that allows the shooter to select the area to engage in a fire-and-forget mode. The EO seeker cannot operate at night, so the SAL would have to be used. A third targeting mode is inertial, meaning the user can \\"snap and shoot\\" at a target without needing to lock on out to 200 meters. Both the Spike missile and reusable launcher each cost $5,000 and weigh loaded, compared to for a Javelin missile and fire control unit. In addition to giving ground troops a light weight missile, the Spike could easily be adapted to fit onto vehicles, aircraft, and small boats. Medium UAVs have difficulty carrying missiles such as the Hellfire due to weight and thrust issues, so the Spike could be bolted on with less effects. Smaller size and less weight allows more missiles to be carried, and the smaller warhead provides lethality against soft targets with less chance of collateral damage. It can also be used by watercraft to defend against fast attack craft (FAC) and fast inshore attack craft (FIAC), where Spike's low cost enables more missiles to be available against large numbers of swarming targets. Although its warhead might not be able to destroy the boats, its superior accuracy would let it hit critical areas to knock them out of commission.Navy's Tiny 5-pound Missile Packs a Big Punch - Wired.com, 28 February 2014 History On 26 May 2004, the Spike accomplished its first three controlled test flights.

Recipients have also included Harvard University, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, various Episcopal and Anglican organizations, and numerous others. Susan Lassen has been involved with the Flowers philanthropic efforts since 2004 and is currently President of the J.C. Flowers Foundation. The Anne and Chris Flowers Foundation (founded 2015) and the J.C. Flowers Foundation (founded 2004) are successors to the White Flowers Foundation (founded 1990). NetsforLife/Malaria Elimination In October 2004, founder Chris Flowers traveled to several remote areas in Zambia. On a visit to the Anglican Mission in Fiwila, Zambia, Flowers witnessed the funeral of a child who had died of malaria; and during his tour of Zambia came to realize that communities did not understand the cause of malaria or its prevention. As a result, the Foundation, in partnership with a number of other organizations, founded NetsforLife. NetsforLife distributes insecticide-treated anti-malaria bednets in remote areas in Africa, typically in partnership with the local Anglican church. Partners in this effort have included Episcopal Relief and Development, various Anglican organizations in Africa, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, Standard Chartered Bank and the Starr Foundation. In 2010, former Coca-Cola CEO Neville Isdell partnered with the Foundations to establish the Isdell:Flowers Cross-Border Anti-Malaria Initiative, which also distributes anti-malaria bednets, in this case in Angola, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. As of December 2014, the Foundations, NetsforLife and the Isdell:Flowers Initiative have raised a total of $34 million for programs to combat malaria in Africa, reaching over 25 million people and distributing over 12 million anti-malaria bednets.

Early life and education The daughter of Guillaume Albert and Dorothy Frances Coppens, she was born Julia Coppens in Singapore. In 1940, her father sent her mother and his two daughters from their home in Indonesia to Vancouver, British Columbia, where he joined them at the end of World War II after he was released from a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Her early education was in Canada. She studied immunology and bacteriology at the University of British Columbia, earning a BA in 1955. Levy received a PhD in experimental pathology from the University of London in 1958. In 1959, she returned to the University of British Columbia as an assistant professor, later becoming full professor. Career Her research led her and her colleagues to participate in the development of photodynamic therapy (PDT) initially for treating cancer but more significantly as the first medical treatment of one of the leading causes of blindness among the elderly, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In 1981, she and four colleagues founded a biopharmaceutical company Quadra Logic Technologies (later QLT Inc.). The PDT drug Photofrin was approved by the Canadian government for treatment of bladder cancer in 1993. Subsequently, it has been approved in the United States and elsewhere for the treatment of several other types of cancer. In the mid-1980s she and colleagues discovered the PDT agent, verteporfin, which QLT and its partner CIBA Vision (now Novartis Ophthalmalics) developed as Visudyne, a treatment for AMD. Visudyne was approved by the US FDA in 2001 and throughout the world thereafter. For ophthalmologists, this therapy added \\"a technique to their treatment armamentarium for some lesions for which there has been no other proven treatment.\\"Bressler, Neil M., and Susan B.

The partially completed pillar was intended to be a base for a portrait of King Perseus. It was originally created to make the Macedonian presence known in Delphi to remind the Delphians of the tradition of friendship existing between them and the royal family.Ridgway, B. (1997). Fourth-century styles in Greek sculpture. Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press. However, the monument was taken over by Aemilius Paullus to celebrate himself and Rome's victory noting that, \\"it was only proper that the conquered should give way to the victors.\\"Plutarch, Life of Aemilius Paullus 28.4 The Monument of Aemilius Paullus stood in front of the Temple of Apollo along with two other commemorative pillars to Eumenes II of Pergamon and Prusias II of Bithynia. However, this pillar dominates over the other two. The completed monument was a bronze equestrian statue atop a rectangular pillar that soared over 9 meters high.Tuck, S. (2015). Roman Wall Painting in the Late Republic. In A history of Roman art (p. 107-108). John Wiley & Sons. While the equestrian statue that was originally on top of pillar no longer remains, the cuttings in the plinth show that the horse would have been in a rearing position. An inscription at the base of the pillar survived, ', which translated reads, \\"Lucius Aemelius, son of Lucius, Imperator, set this up from the spoils which he took from King Perseus and the Macedonians.\\"CIL 1(2) 622/ILS 8884 Details and significance of the frieze Deployed on all four sides at the top of the rectangular marble pillar, is a relief frieze depicting the Battle of Pydna. The frieze runs 6.5 meters long and 0.31 meters high. The figures are carved in high relief out of white veined marble with a brown patina.Strong, D., & Toynbee, J. (1976). Roman art (p. 37). Harmondsworth: Penguin. The frieze is the earliest known example of Greek sculpture in a purely Roman context. The Hellenistic style reliefs are the first surviving sculpture that depicts a Roman historical narrative.Roisman, J. (2011). A Companion to Ancient Macedonia (1., Auflage ed., p. 531). New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons. There is no landscape or context filling the space, but only the two armies on horseback and foot fighting one another. It is organized by groups of combatants with dead or dying warriors in between to fill the space. The battle scenes are lively with a lot of foreshortening from the rear and a strong attention to detail. The variance in details between the armor and weapons distinguishes the two sides. The Romans carry large oval shields (scuta) while the Macedonians' shields are rounded.Taylor, Michael J. (2016). \\"The Battle Scene on Aemilius Paullus's Pydna Monument: A Reevaluation.\\" Hesperia 85.3, p. 559-576. Nude warriors, once thought to be heroic nudes of fallen Romans, are probably Celtic mercenaries serving under Perseus. On one long side of the frieze, a riderless horse dominates the scene, and alludes to the tradition that the battle developed from pickets skirmishing over an escaped horse (or mule).Plutarch, Life of Aemilius 18.1; Livy 44.40. The story was told that an oracle had said whichever side started the battle would lose. A Roman horse got loose and ran towards the opposition, causing Perseus to assume the Romans had initiated battle. When he attacked in return, Perseus was starting the battle himself. Therefore, the riderless horse marks the scene as a specific historic event — the Battle of Pydna — rather than generic combat between Romans and Macedonians. Some suggest that each panel should be read as a different phase of the battle, from the initial skirmishing to the final rout. Taylor argues that the four reliefs together were intended to depict a single scene of Roman victory, and that the prominence of cavalry throughout alludes to the successful mounted pursuit of fleeing Macedonians after the phalanx had broken.

Verism is a style of Roman portraiture that portrays an individual with aging facial features, most notably sagging skin around the mouth and eyes, short-cropped or balding hair, and deep wrinkles on the forehead and around the eyes and mouth. These features were emphasized under the tradition of verism in order to stress an advanced moral and psychological consciousness that comes along with advanced age.Gisela M. A. Richter. (1955). The Origin of Verism in Roman Portraits. The Journal of Roman Studies, 45, 39–46. The veristic features of the pseudo-athlete's head are juxtaposed with the figure's body, which is depicted in the guise of an athletic youth from Classical Greece. The pseudo- athlete's body is typically depicted in heroic-nudity with highly smooth muscular forms and are often shown in an active stance or standing in an S-shaped curved known as contrapposto.  Potential Origins  Veristic style was likely developed as a reference to the images associated with Roman funerary rituals. From Polybios's writings on funerary rituals we know that wax masks were created from the faces of the deceased in order to create an exact replica of their likeness that would be worn by someone of similar stature during the funerary ritual.Polybius, Histories, 6.53. c. 150 BCE. Megapolis, Greece. These public funerals intended to honor the virtuous character of the deceased, emphasizing prized Roman values such as stern moral seriousness (gravitas), firmness and strictness of judgement (severitas), and determination and self-possession (constantia). It is likely that in order to associate themselves with their honorable ancestors, living patrons began to reference the style of these funerary masks in their own portraiture. The veristic style of Late Republican Rome came in contact with the idealized style of Classical Greece largely on the Island of Delos, where Greek artists and Roman patrons lived in close proximity. During the late republic, many Roman traders and merchants came to Delos to take advantage of its central location for sea trade, bringing their own artistic style along with them. These merchants had enough disposable wealth to afford portrait commissions from the local Greek artists that were familiar with sculpting in the idealized style of Classical Greece, thus causing the two drastically different styles to merge in a way that may appear semi-awkward to the modern eye. Scholars like Tom Stevenson have also credited the origins of the pseudo- athlete to the desire of Roman patrons on the island of Delos to be depicted with both the energy and passion of youth that is valued by Greeks along with wisdom of age that Romans value. This led to the creation of portrait sculptures that combine a veristic head and youthful body.  Roman examples = Pseudo-Athlete of Delos  331x331px The Pseudo-athlete of Delos is a larger than life-size nude male portrait measuring 7 feet and 5 inches tall (about 2.26 meters) that is dated to around 100 BCE. It was found in a house on the Greek island of Delos that the French excavators who discovered the sculpture have dubbed the House of the Diadoumenos, since a copy of Polykleitos's sculpture of an athlete binding his hair (The Diadoumenos) was discovered at the same site. The sculpture depicts the Roman businessman or potential slave trader that owned the house and had enough disposable wealth to commission a portrait of himself. The bust of the sculpture follows the tradition of Roman veristic portraiture, most notably in the figure's balding head, large ears, the subtle wrinkles on his forehead and at the corners of his mouth, as well the sagging skin around his neck and chin. The Pseudo- athlete's body departs from the Roman Republican tradition and more closely resembles sculptures of athletic youth from Classical Greece. The figure's body is smoothed over with idealized musculature that does not match the figure's aged face. The sculpture also depicts the patron in contrapposto, or a stance in which the figure's weight is distributed unequally on their two feet, creating a naturalistic \\"s-shaped\\" curve of the body. The Pseudo-Athlete of Delos plants the bulk of his weight on right foot, while his left foot lifts up slightly off the ground in a subtle stride. Scholars of Roman art like Fred Kleiner note that the stance of the Pseudo-athlete is drawn directly from the stance of the Diadoumenos, since the figure's weight is distributed in a similar manner. The weight of the marble of the Pseudo-Athlete is even supported by a tree-trunk shaped strut located next to the figure's right leg that mimics the one seen on Polykleitos's Diadoumenos. Other scholars like J. J. Politt have interpreted the body of the figure as a reference to the muscular torso of Hermes, the Italian counterpart to the Roman god Mercury who was the patron God of businessmen and is often associated directly with the traders on the island of Delos, like the patron of this sculpture.418x418pxOther than its veristic head, the Pseudo-athlete of Delos references the tradition of Roman portraiture because of its inclusion of the draped fabric. A traditional Greek nude is shown completely bare, but Roman portraits were almost always clothed, since public displays of nudity were typically associated with condemned criminals that were stripped as a form of shaming, or slaves who were displayed naked during trades. While the Pseudo- Athlete is depicted nude, the drapery of the fabric serves as a nod to the Roman tradition of depicting the drapery of Roman garments, even with the distinctly un-Roman nude form. In this way the simultaneous inclusion of draped fabric and a nude form represents another merger of Roman and Greek portrait traditions within the Pseudo-athlete of Delos.  Tivoli General  In Tivoli, at the Sanctuary of Hercules, a pseudo-athlete portrait of a general was found. The marble sculpture with a veristic Roman head and idealized Greek body dates back to 75-50 BCE. To show his rank in the army and hold up the heavy marble statue, there is a cuirass at his side. His typical Republican stern and wrinkled face is contrasted by a youthful almost nude body that exudes power and is in the tradition of a Hellenistic ruler. Through the reference back to Greek idealized body, the patron expresses cultural superiority. The general exudes modesty by using a draped cloth to cover his genitals.

She turned into composition relatively late in her life, at age 35, starting to compose after the divorce from her first husband, Romeo Cascarino. She stated that through composition, she had “found her fulfilment” in life. About her late start in composition, she stated that before she was 35, she \\"...was totally absorbed in becoming a concert pianist at that time, and taught and coached singers, accompanied, played chamber music, played in cocktail lounges, worked with an opera company.\\" Garwood became best known for her operatic adaptation of literary works by Nathaniel Hawthorne, including The Scarlet Letter and \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\". She also composed works for instrumental chamber ensembles, orchestras, and other vocal ensembles. Many of her works were commissioned by the Pennsylvania Opera Theater. Garwood received a master's degree in Composition from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, where her husband Dr. Donald Chittum worked as a professor of world music and music theory. She taught at Muhlenberg College, where she taught students like composer Andrea Clearfield. Margaret Garwood died on May 3, 2015 in her home in Wyncote, at age 88, from acute heart failure.  Biography = Early life  Margaret Garwood was born in New Jersey on March 22, 1927. Her father, Morse Garwood, was a tax lawyer, and her mother, Miriam Frew, was a feminist housewife. She also had a brother, Charles Garwood, who was born in 1930. There were no musicians in her immediate family, but music was always present in her family through audio recordings and radio broadcasts of the music of Richard Wagner and Ludwig van Beethoven. Her first musical experiences involved playing songs on the piano by ear when she was six years old. At this age, she started to have formal piano lessons with Carol Johnston Sharpe. When Garwood was fourteen, her family moved to a farm in Chester County, Pennsylvania. She continued her piano studies with Allison Drake from the Philadelphia Conservatory for two years. She also received lessons from Earle Echternacht, a private instructor in Lancaster, for an additional year. Garwood moved from Chester County to Philadelphia with her mother in 1944 when her parents divorced. In Philadelphia, Garwood continued her piano studies while her mother worked for Planned Parenthood, first as a field worker and then as an administrator.  Life as a pianist and composer  In 1950, she took a job with a local opera company as an assistant to composer and director Romeo Cascarino. Eventually, Garwood and Cascarino married in 1953. She learned about composition and orchestration by listening to his music and observing his writing process. During this time, she taught piano at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Here she met Dr. Donald Chittum, who would become a strong supporter of her work, and eventually her husband. From 1958 to 1970, Garwood would commute from Philadelphia to New York City to study with Joseph Prostakoff, himself a student of Abby Whiteside. In 1964, whilst studying with Prostakoff, Garwood began working as a composer. Prostakoff introduced Garwood to Miriam Gideon, another Abby Whiteside student. Gideon would be Garwood’s composition mentor. Their relationship did not consist of traditional composition lessons, but rather Gideon would serve as an educated and informed soundboard for when Garwood needed assistance with her compositions. This relationship lasted until Gideon’s death in 1996. She reflected on her musical education experience by stating that \\"I didn't believe pianists should go to college. They should stay home and practice. To this end, I studied piano extensively, going to New York every week for 12 years, and took courses that I felt like taking at the Philadelphia Music Academy. In 1975, after my second divorce, I applied for a teaching job at Muhlenberg University in Allentown, but although I had been teaching from 1953–1970 at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, I needed a Master's degree in order to teach at Muhlenberg.\\" In 1969, Garwood met and married her second husband, economist Joe Oberman. In 1970, they moved to a farm in East Greenville, two hours from Philadelphia. During this time, Garwood developed a rabbit growing business. She resumed teaching piano in 1975 in Muhlenberg College in Allentown. Garwood and Oberman divorced in 1979, and Garwood resumed her teaching in Muhlenberg College until 1984. In 1981, Garwood married Dr. Donald Chittum, a professor of music at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Dr. Chittum insisted Garwood quit her teaching career to focus on her compositional work. Garwood's compositional process tended to be slow and careful, a trait she learned from her experiences with Romeo Cascarino. She has been the recipient of fellowships and awards from the National Endowment of the Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the National Opera Institute, and the National Federation of Music Clubs.

Gupta is a professor at New York University Tandon School of Engineering department of mechanical and aerospace engineering. He is one of the leading researchers on lightweight foams and has extensively worked on hollow particle filled composite materials called syntactic foams. Gupta developed a new functionally graded syntactic foam material and a method to create multifunctional syntactic foams. His team has also created an ultralight magnesium alloy syntactic foam that is able to float on water. Gupta has appeared on Discovery Channel and in National Geographic as a materials science expert, particularly for lightweight materials. In 2012, Gupta explained the science behind athletic helmet construction as part of a National Science Foundation-sponsored video featured on NBC Learn during the 2012 Summer Olympics, which was a series of 10 videos that had more than 125 million views and won a Telly Award. Education In 1996, Gupta graduated from the Malaviya National Institute of Technology-Jaipur with a Bachelor of Engineering degree. He received a Master of Engineering degree from the Indian Institute of Science in 1998. In 2003, Gupta graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Science (Mechanical Engineering) from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Research =Polymer matrix composite materials Gupta began his work on lightweight porous composite materials called syntactic foams in 1997. His work on polymer matrix syntactic foams resulted in several fundamental developments including establishing the wall thickness of hollow particle reinforcement as an important parameter, in addition to the volume fraction, for controlling the properties of syntactic foams. Another development was the use of a combination of particle wall thickness and volume fraction to develop a new type of functionally graded composite materials that has higher damage tolerance than other types of foams. Additionally, a method was developed that is capable of providing syntactic foams tailored for several mechanical, thermal, electrical, and physical properties simultaneously. Use of polymer matrix syntactic foams in USS Zumwalt for lightweight and stealth has been reported. Gupta worked on the use of fly ash hollow particles (cenospheres) in creating syntactic foams. Fly ash is an environmental pollutant and beneficial uses of this material are desired. The work of fly ash utilization in composite materials was featured in National Geographic and Fast Company magazine. Metal matrix syntactic foams Gupta has studied aluminum, magnesium, iron and invar matrix syntactic foams. His work produced the development of a magnesium-alloy matrix syntactic foam that has density of 0.9 g/cc and can float on water. Gupta and his team were the first to create this lightweight metal matrix composite with no porosity in the matrix, which received media attention. At this density level, metal matrix composites can compete against polymer matrix composites but also provide higher temperature withstanding capabilities. His team was also the first to report synthesis of a metal matrix syntactic foam core sandwich composite. Studies on high strain rate properties of materials Gupta studied several composites that have applications as protective materials in civilian and military vehicles. He has used split-Hopkinson pressure bar to study response of polymer and metal matrix syntactic foams. The change in the direction of fracture as the strain rate increases was reported as one of the novel findings in these studies. Gupta studied the response of bones and tissue for high strain rate properties and his research showed that the fracture of bones can be very different at high strain rate compression, such as high speed car crash or bomb blast. His research was covered in LiveScience and Scientific American. This study showed a network of micro cracks in the bone, apart from large fractures, which could be missed in routine imaging. Fiber-optic sensors Gupta’s group researches the integration of sensors with composite materials to help in detecting the damage during their service condition. His work resulted in the development of a new patented fiber-optic sensor design. The sensor, based on intensity modulation in optical fiber through a curved section, is capable of measuring displacement or strain. Due to small size of this sensor, it can be integrated with composite materials. Other activities Gupta is an advocate of communicating science and technology to non-scientists and youth. He has written several articles explaining how scientific discoveries are transitioning into modern systems. Gupta wrote an article about helmets used in professional sports and recreation and was featured in a video produced by NBC Learn in his lab on helmets used in Olympic sports. He hosts high school students in his research lab during a summer program called Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering (ARISE). Gupta is a member of the Composites Materials Committee of TMS and ASM-International as well as the editorial board of Composites Part B: Engineering (Elsevier), Materials Science and Engineering A (Elsevier), Materials Processing and Characterization (ASTM) and Journal of Composites (Hindawi). Award recognition Gupta has been recognized by various professional societies with awards such as ASM-International Silver Medal, TMS Professional Development Award, ASM–Indian Institute of Metals (ASM-IIM) Visiting Lectureship, and Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship for his research and lectureship.

The Humanistisch Verbond (HV, sometimes translated as Humanistic Association Netherlands, Dutch Humanist AssociationPeter Derkx, \\"The Future of Humanism\\" in: or Dutch Humanist League) is a Dutch association based on secular humanist principles.  Basics  The foundation of the HV is that everyone is responsible for their own actions, but also has co-responsibility for the environment and others. The HV strives to spread and protect values such as self-determination, equal treatment and toleration. These have freedom of choice and personal responsibility at their core. The HV uses slogans such as: *Zelf denken, samen leven (\\"Thinking for yourself, living together\\") *Het Humanistisch Verbond wil een inspiratiebron en ontmoetingsplaats zijn. Het behartigt tevens de belangen van mensen die zich in het humanisme herkennen (\\"The Humanistisch Verbond wants to be a source of inspiration and place to meet up.

Netherlands Ruard Ganzevoort at an HV event. The Humanistisch Verbond (HV) was founded on 17 February 1946 as a response to 'spiritual nihilism' - that was held partially responsible for the atrocities of the Second World War - and the slighting of the non- religious in the Netherlands. The initiators were, amongst others, Jaap van Praag, Garmt Stuiveling and Jan Brandt Corstius. The widow of the prominent freethinker and humanist Leo Polak, Henriette Polak, was also closely involved in the foundation. The goal of the HV was uniting all humanists and deepening, spreading and defending the humanist worldview. Nowadays the HV focuses on the motto Zelf denken, samen leven (\\"Thinking for yourself, living together\\") to fulfilling two core tasks: #Formulating humanist perspectives to current worldview and personal questions; #Reinforcing and establishing humanist services, including humanist mental care, humanist funeral guidance and humanist formative education.

The tomb is located within the Necropolis of Monterozzi and dates to around 530-520 BC. This tomb is one of the first tombs in Tarquinia to have figural decoration on all four walls of its main or only chamber.A History of Roman Art, Enhanced Edition, Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning, Boston, 2010 The wall decoration was frescoed between 530-520 BC by an Ionian Greek painter, perhaps from Phocaea, whose style was associated with that of the Northern Ionic workers active in Elmali. This tomb is also the first time a theme not of mythology, but instead depictions of funerary rites and funerary games are seen.The Great Centuries of Painting: Etruscan Painting, Second Edition, The World Publishing Company, Cleveland, 1952  Description  The chamber is decorated with a figurative frieze on all four walls. The inclusion of plants and animals in all four frescos have led scholars to interpret that the events depicted in the tomb to take place outside. sadly many of the figures depicted in the frieze, specifically those on the left and front wall, have been lost as the frescos have deteriorated over time and from exposure. The entrance wall has figures placed on it yet because of deterioration no one can say for sure who or what these figures are and the actions that they are depicting.  Rear Wall  Painting on the rear wall On the center of the rear wall a painted door is placed. Scholars differ on interpretations of what the door denotes. Some interpret the door as a representational illustration of the door to the tomb. It is, however, more likely interpreted by scholars as a symbolic door or portal to the Underworld that acts as a barrier between the kingdom of the living and the kingdom of the dead. Two figures on either side of the door each extend one arm towards the door and the other arm places the hand against their forehead in a gesture of salutation and mourning. The two men scholars either interpret as augurs or as mourners who are relatives of the deceased. The latter is thought to be the more accepted interpretation of the two figures since reading the name written on the wall next to the men, Apastanasar, contains the root of apa which means father. Above the door shows a lion and leopard killing a deer. {align =center 240px The two augurs on either side of the door, rear wall of the tomb. 210px  }  Right Wall  The whole right wall depicts the funerary games in honor of the deceased. Funerary games were a tradition among many ancient societies, which is emphasized and illustrated to modern readers from Homer's description in the Iliad of the contests staged at the funeral of Patroclus. Homer writes: \\"Wrestling is the third event. Fairly typical, the prizes are a tripod [three 3-footed cauldrons given as gifts] worth 12 oxen for first prize, and a woman worth 4 oxen for the loser.\\"Homer, \\"The Iliad\\", Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Book 23: The Funeral Games of Patroclus This wrestling scene that Homer describes in the Iliad can be seen in the central motif of the right wall. It is also important to note the Etruscan funerary games, often bloody and deadly in nature, are seen as the original gladiatorial games as stated by the Romans. As a result, this part of Etruscan culture was inherited by the Romans into their own culture as a precursor to the spectacle of gladiatorial combat. On the far end of the wall, closest to the rear wall, depicts a man wearing a purple tebenna, common Etruscan male robe, whose color alludes to the man being of elevated stature. The man is looking over his shoulder and gestures with a salutary pose to his two attendants, two figures of shorter stature. One attendant carries a folding stool, the official seat of the man's high office, and the other attendant is huddled on the ground with a hood covering his head. Many scholars interpret this end of the motif of the crouched attendant as weeping/mourning for his master, which leads scholars to conclude that the man in the purple robes is most likely the deceased coming to watch his funeral games. In the center of the right wall shows the funerary game of wrestling in honor of the deceased. Depicted are two wrestlers – one younger and one older – who are wrestling in the Greek style [stark naked so no grabbing hold of any piece of clothing can take place]. The younger wrestler is identified as having no beard and having a slimmer torso while the older wrestler has a beard, an identifying marker for advanced age in a male, and a thicker upper body. Placed between the two wrestlers are three bowls of different colors, perhaps representing a silver, bronze and copper bowl, that are positioned one top of each other and are most likely the prize for the winner, as described in the Iliad. To the left of the younger wrestler presides the agonothetes, the referee, who watches over the match. Written above the man is the word teverath leading scholars to question if this is the man's name, occupation or title. Clad in a cloak with one arm outstretched and in the other he carries a lituus, an augur's crook, he approaches the wrestling match. Two red birds are flying over the wrestling match, a detail that led to the initial misinterpretation of the scene depicting two augurs, are actually the deceased and referee watching the flying birds and the match. Hence the name, Tomb of the Augurs. On the closest section to the entrance of the right wall is the last motif, which some may consider quite gruesome. It is here the funerary game of bloodletting, a game performed to appease the soul of the deceased, is shown. A masked figure wearing a pointy hat, a long, black false beard, a black/blue jacket with white tassels, and a red loincloth is shown with the word phersu written above. The Etruscan word phersu, meaning \\"mask,\\" \\"masked man,\\" or even possibly \\"actor,\\" since in Greek and Roman plays the actors always wore masks to show what sort of characters were being impersonated. Scholars debate that the phersu painted in this scene is an actor costumed to impersonate an executioner. It is said that when the Romans adopted the Etruscan custom of using slaves and criminals as gladiators, first in funeral games, and finally in exhibitions in vast arenas for the general public, once a gladiator fell mortally wounded and lay still in the arena, out came one masked and costumed man to deal him a \\"mercy blow\\" with a hammer to his forehead. But it wasn't a phersu that this fellow impersonated. It was Charun, the Etruscan demon who ferried the dead into Hades.Xanthippos, Funeral Games in the Tomb of the Augurs, 2011 From this scholars even say that the masked man is in fact an actor impersonating Charun in the tomb of the Augurs and not a torturer or executioner. The phersu is holding a rope that is attached to the collar of a black dog. When the phersu pulls on the rope, as depicted in the fresco, a nail on the dog's collar bites into its neck, enraging the animal and causing it to attack a tethered man. The tethered man has multiple bleeding bites on his legs, a sack tied over his head and a club in one hand to fend off the dog giving the bloodletting an exciting aspect for the Etruscan spectators to watch. Many scholars believe that this tethered man is a condemned criminal already sentenced to die that is being used for the funerary games. (Although this animal has customarily been described as a \\"dog,\\" the length of its tail, the proportions of its head and the fact that it is using its exposed claws to lacerate its adversary's legs would seem to make it far more likely that the \\"black dog\\" is actually a black leopard.)  Left Wall  At the center of this wall two boxers can be seen fighting. To the right of the boxers another phersu can be seen. The action of the phersu is debated. Some interpret the phersu, who is wearing only a red tunic and no loincloth, as dancing solo surrounded by nature. Yet other scholars disagree with this interpretation. Instead other scholars take note of the remnants of two figures to the far left of the wall. One figure can be interpreted as an auleta, a musician playing the aulos. The other, scholars note, only shows the figure's legs. The lost figure's legs are the same hue as the other athletes and are in the same position as the phersu’s at the other end of the wall. Scholars interpret this scene as the phersu being pursued by an opponent in some sort of funerary game.

The message states a Japanese battleship is approaching Pearl Harbor, Private Steve \\"Lucky\\" Smith (Don \\"Red\\" Barry) meets his fellow soldiers Bruce Gordon (Alan Curtis) and \\"Portly\\" Porter (Maynard Holmes) in the Casa Marina bar, where Lucky and Steve try to attract Portly's sister, Marcia (Fay McKenzie). Portly arranges for Marcia to be the secretary to Andy L. Anderson (Rhys Williams), the owner of the bar. A businessman named Littlefield (Robert Emmett Keane) slips into Marcia's booth to read the message in the Kümmel bottle. Lucky comes to her defence by attacking Littlefield, with Bruce and Portly joining the fight. Captain Hudson (Ian Keith) orders the soldiers to find the spy's radio. Though Lucky is in charge, he soon returns to the bar to find Marcia. Bruce and Portly, meanwhile, pick up a coded radio transmission from a Japanese boat and follow the beam to Littlefield's hideout. A gunfight erupts where Portly is killed and Littlefield escapes. When Lucky later admits to the captain that he was not there, the captain court-martials him and promotes Bruce to corporal. Lucky escapes from jail and soon after, Anderson, one of the spies, meets with Van Hoorten (Sig Ruman), another Nazi posing as a Dutch Indian. They discuss a plan to stockpile ammunition and gas for the Japanese troops who will invade. Anderson is to kill Littlefield and arrange for the gas to be transported to their warehouse, but when Lucky turns to Anderson for help, Anderson slyly tips him off to Littlefield's hideout. That night, Lucky attacks Littlefield but Anderson shoots him, then gives Lucky the job of transporting some \\"crude oil\\" to his warehouse. On the way, Bruce stops Lucky's truck and asks him to turn himself in. At the warehouse, Lucky realizes that his cargo is gasoline. Marcia and Lucky sneak into Van Hoorten's office that night and find ammunition and a Nazi flag. Van Hoorten bursts in and Lucky shoots him. Bruce, who has tracked Lucky to the warehouse, hears a radio announcement that Pearl Harbor has been bombed. Before the three can leave, Japanese aircraft land nearby and the soldiers enter the office with Anderson. The three Americans escape, find a radio and send Captain Hudson a message for help. When the American troops arrive, Hudson spots another Japanese aircraft carrier in the bay. Lucky courageously saves the Americans by flying a Japanese aircraft into the carrier in a suicide mission.

Mnookin has been the Chair of the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School since 1994. Early life and education Mnookin was born and grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. He graduated from Pembroke-Country Day School in 1960 and from Harvard College in 1964 with an A.B. in Economics, magna cum laude. After earning his bachelor's degree, he studied for a year as a Fulbright Scholar at the Econometric Institute in Rotterdam. Upon returning to the U.S., he attended Harvard Law School. Mnookin graduated with his LL.B. in 1968, magna cum laude. Career Mnookin clerked for federal D.C. Circuit judge Carl McGowan and then Supreme Court Justice, John Marshall Harlan, in 1969 and 1970. He worked at a San Francisco law firm between 1970 and 1972 before joining the law faculty at the University of California, Berkeley and becoming the first director of the Childhood and Government Project of the Earl Warren Legal Institute. At Berkeley, his researching and writing concerned family law, foster care, child custody, and other children's rights topics. He was also involved in drafting legislation to reform California's foster care system. Mnookin's first book, Child, Family, and State, was released in 1978. In 1979, Mnookin penned an article entitled \\"Bargaining in the Shadow of the Law: The Case of Divorce\\" which appeared in the Yale Law Journal. A 1996 analysis by Fred R.

In 1987, he became the first Adelbert H. Sweet Professor of Law at Stanford. The following year, he became the director of the new Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation which he established with Stanford professors Kenneth Arrow, Lee Ross, Amos Tversky and Robert Wilson. Together they explored and wrote about barriers to the negotiated resolution of conflict. With developmental psychologist and fellow Stanford professor, Eleanor Maccoby, Mnookin conducted a longitudinal study that traced how 1000 divorcing families resolved custody issues in the midst of divorce. After serving as a visiting professor for the 1990–91 academic year Mnookin joined the Harvard Law School faculty permanently in 1993 where he is the Samuel Williston Professor of Law, the Chair of the Program on Negotiation, and the Director of the Harvard Negotiation Research Project. Over the course of his career, Mnookin has served as a neutral arbitrator or mediator in a number of complex commercial disputes. Along with co-arbitrator, John L. Jones, Mnookin helped resolve a software rights dispute between IBM and Fujitsu in 1987. Mnookin has also facilitated a number of confidential meetings related to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict and has written about Belgium's ethnic conflict between the Flemish and Walloon populations.

The company's main attraction is a floating at-sea aquarium containing Southern blue fin tuna and other marine species. The facility is located within a Habitat Protection Zone of the Encounter Marine Park and opened to the public on 2 September 2017.  Attraction  Oceanic Victor's main attraction is a single modified tuna seacage moored to the seabed, which was purchased from Swim with Tuna in 2015. Visitors have the opportunity to swim with and feed southern bluefin tuna, and observe other species via an underwater viewing deck and touch-tank aquaria. At the time of its proposal, the sea cage was to contain up to five tonnes of southern bluefin tuna, and up to 0.5 tonnes combined of other species native to South Australian waters. Tuna were to be fed with South Australian caught pilchards. Visitors to the attraction depart from Granite Island in a catamaran, which then moors at the aquarium, which is a specially-modified commercial tuna ranching pen. Those wishing to swim with the tuna and other fishes are provided with wetsuits, gloves, boots, masks and snorkels and those seeking to remain dry can view the fish from an underwater viewing platform. Employee David Priess told SA Weekender that Oceanic Victor provides an opportunity \\"to jump in the water with some local South Australian aquatic species, have a really good time, a great experience... and learn a bit about South Australian aquaculture and fisheries at the same time.\\" The company's website describes its goals as providing \\"an opportunity to experience and understand our diverse marine environment\\" while \\"promoting South Australia’s strengths as a source of clean, green and sustainable quality seafood for the world\\". Additional facilities and attractions include a cafe onshore at Granite Island, and nocturnal walking tours of the island's Little penguin colony.  Origins  In 1996, \\"tuna baron\\" Hagen Stehr considered establishing a tuna farm in Encounter Bay as a tourist attraction to cater for Japanese tourists. In 2010, a similar venture was launched in Boston Bay near Port Lincoln, which ran from 2010 to 2015 where it was managed by Emma Forster. A similar proposal was made in 2015 by another Port Lincoln tuna baron, Tony Santic, acting as a director of the newly formed company, Oceanic Victor Pty Ltd. The new company's co-director is his business associate, Michael \\"Mick\\" Dyer, who is Operations Manager at Santic's commercial tuna farming business, Tony's Tuna International. During the planning and approval process, the applicant was also represented by Heather Montgomerie, a former State Government employee who held senior positions at Primary Industries and Regions SA (PIRSA) Aquaculture for over a decade. Also representing the applicant was Hagen Stehr's daughter, Yasmin, who has previously worked for her family's commercial tuna and kingfish farming business, Clean Seas. The infrastructure used by Swim with the Tuna between 2010 and 2015 was purchased by Oceanic Victor. It was intended to be towed to Encounter Bay, near Granite Island, where Oceanic Victor was allocated a pilot aquaculture lease by PIRSA. Emma Forster was employed as an advisor to Oceanic Victor throughout the planning and approval process. Her father Ron originally constructed the observation deck component of the Oceanic Victor attraction in 1989, after which it was used in waters near Port Lincoln to aid the early development of the tuna farming industry. It was also moored off Granite Island between 1997 and 2004 where it served as a tourist attraction prior to the development of the Swim with the Tuna concept.  Planning  Oceanic Victor's planning process officially commenced with an unsolicited proposal made to the Office of the State Coordinator General in 2015. The company subsequently sought planning approvals from various government departments and agencies, including PIRSA Aquaculture, the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure, the Victor Harbor council and the Australian Environment Department under the EPBC Act. Oceanic Victor's proprietors initially anticipated their attraction would be operational ahead of 12 December 2015, the commencement of the school holiday season. On 16 December 2015, Oceanic Victors proposal was not deemed to be a Controlled Action under the EPBC Act, therefore Federal environmental approval was not required. On 17 December 2015, a meeting of South Australia's Development Assessment Commission received Michael Dyer, Yasmine Stehr, Heather Montgomerie and Donna Ferretti representing the applicant, Roscoe Shelton for DEWNR, Heidi Alleway and Luke Fraser for PIRSA and fifteen other individuals. The Commission considered Oceanic Victor's application and approved it the following day. A mooring point to accommodate cruise ships has also been proposed adjacent to Oceanic Victor's pilot aquaculture lease. In January 2016, Mick Dyer told the Port Lincoln Times that prior to opening the company needed to \\"get the mooring organised, take footage of the bottom and brand the facility and the penguin centre.” The facility was expected to be towed into place off Granite Island in February 2016, pending the result of an appeal of the Development Assessment Commission's approval decision. In March 2016, the owners announced that the venture would return to Port Lincoln and reopen there, under the previous name of \\"Swim with the Tuna\\". The result of the appeal of the Development Assessment Commission's approval decision was expected in October or November 2016. The appeal was unsuccessful. In November 2016, Oceanic Victor announced that it would not be opening in 2016 as previously planned, nor during the 2016-17 South Australian school holidays. Oceanic Victor opened to the public for the first time on 2 September 2017.  Reception  Throughout the venture's planning process, the project attracted both support and opposition from community members of the Encounter Bay area. Some opponents raised concerns that the approval process seemed rushed and that the attraction might increase shark visitation to the area or adversely impact on little penguins which breed on the bay's rocky islands. A poll initiated by the Victor Harbor Times newspaper indicated that critics of the proposal may have outnumbered its supporters. On 10 January hundreds of protestors participated in a paddle-out demonstration to show their opposition to the tuna pen. A group called the Friends of the Encounter Coast was formed in response to the Oceanic Victor proposal and an appeal against the facility's approval was heard in the South Australian Environment, Resources and Development Court. Another protest on 21 February attracted hundreds of protesters and the support of Sea Shepherd. The appeal of the facility's approval was unsuccessful. Director Mick Dyer rebutted some of the concerns expressed during interviews, media appearances and in a letter to the editor published in the Victor Harbor Times, published on 18 February 2016. The company's directors expected Oceanic Victor to attract over 10,000 patrons in its first year of operation.

The club's greatest success has been its two championships in the tier three Oberliga Westfalen in 1982–83, 1984–85. This entitled the club to, unsuccessfully, take part in the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga in 1983 and 1985. History The club's origins date back to 1922 when VfR Heessen was formed. VfR competed on a number of occasions unsuccessfully for promotion to the Gauliga Westfalen, the highest tier of football in Westphalia after 1933. The club continued play during the Second World War until 1944. VfR profited from the availability of workers from local coal mines to play for the club. A firedamp explosion at the Zeche Sachsen mine in 1944 however which claimed 169 lives, including 113 foreign workers, brought play to a halt.Die Vereinsgeschichte scealteherren.de – Club history, accessed: 7 November 2015 In 1970 VfR Heessen merged with TuS Heessen to form Eintracht Heessen with the new club taking up VfR's place in the Landesliga Westfalen. After ten seasons there a league championship in 1979–80 took the club up to the Verbandsliga. Newly promoted to the Verbandsliga Westfalen the club won the north-east division and earned promotion to the Oberliga Westfalen in 1980–81.Historic German football league tables Das Deutsche Fussball Archiv, accessed: 4 November 2015 Eintracht Hamm played the next six seasons in the Oberliga, winning the league in 1982–83 and 1984–85 and finishing runners-up in the season between. The two league championships qualified the club for the promotion round to the 2. Bundesliga but it was unsuccessful on both occasions. In the 1983 2. Bundesliga promotion round Eintrach Hamm faced FC St. Pauli, SC Charlottenburg and Rot-Weiß Oberhausen, with the latter two winning promotion while Hamm finished one point behind Charlottenburg in third place. The club took part in the 1984 German amateur football championship where it reached the final but lost to Offenburger FV 4–1. In the 1985 2. Bundesliga promotion round Hamm played against Hummelsbütteler SV, Rot-Weiss Essen, Tennis Borussia Berlin and VfL Osnabrück. This time the team came fourth, three points behind second placed Tennis Borussia while VfL Osnabrück won the tournament. The club's rise had been made possible through sponsorship of the local Hammer Bank. When the latter collapsed in November 1984 the fortunes of the club drastically changed. After its failed second attempt in promotion to professional football and the loss of its sponsor the club quickly declined, finishing ninth in 1985–86 and being relegated from the Oberliga the season after, finishing sixteenth. The following season Hamm came sixteenth in the Verbandsliga as well and was relegated from there, too. Eintracht Hamm struggled financially in the following years, having to accommodate a huge debt. By 1993 the club had however recovered. In 2006 Eintracht Hamm merged with SV 26 Heessen to form SV Eintracht Heessen.

Currently, the possession and consumption of alcohol is prohibited for Afghan nationals. However, the Afghan government provides a license for various many outlets to distribute alcoholic beverages to foreign journalists and tourists, and black market alcohol consumption is prevalent as well. Bringing two bottles or two litres of alcoholic beverages is allowed for foreigners entering Afghanistan.Babur having the course of the stream being altered at Istalif The Afghan Royal Family During the era of King Amanullah and Zahir Shah of the Afghan Royal Family, Alcohol was part of society and the elite in Kabul were known for their extravagant parties. Overview Afghanistan currently has about of areas cultivating grapes and excellent climate and terroir suitable for quality wine. While the history of wine goes back much longer, viticulture seems to have been well established in parts of Afghanistan by at least the fourth century BC. It is said that Babur, the first Mughal emperor, learned about wine in Kabul. His autobiographical memoirs, the Baburnama, is said to mention especially neighboring Istalif (the name possibly derived from Greek staphile, grape), \\"with vineyards and orchards on either side of its torrent, its waters cold and pure\\". The Mughal Empire received high quality wine from the Indus valley and Afghanistan. Medieval times saw a comparably flourishing wine production, which was ended in the 18th century. The 1960s saw trials to restart production, which was ended by the Taliban. Around 1969, a French survey estimated that (larger) vineyards covered about 37,500 hectare and 2% of the arable land. The largest part of vineyards was close to Herat, Kandahar and Kabul; smaller areas have been found on the northern border. The French survey has focused on the largest professional vineyards, but mentions grapes being grown in various gardens, even at 2,400 m altitude in Nuristan Province. A 1968 estimate related to a local aid program came to overall. By comparison, Austrian wine is grown in an area of about . The main current production is around Kabul and goes – for religious reasons – mostly into juice and raisins. Locals A Drunken Babur Returns to Camp at Night Afghanistan is one of 16 countries in the world where the drinking of alcoholic beverages at any age is illegal for most of its citizens. Violation of the law by locals is subject to punishment in accordance with the Sharia law. Drinkers can be fined, imprisoned or prescribed 60 lashes with whip. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), alcohol consumption in Afghanistan is – officially – almost nonexistent. The total alcohol consumption in Afghanistan was approximately zero during 2003–05; during 2008–10, the recorded alcohol consumption was also zero but unrecorded consumption was estimated at 0.7 liters per capita. Enforcement of the law is inconsistent, and alcohol is widely available on the black market, especially in Kabul and in the western city of Herat, where good homemade wine is reported to be readily available at reasonable prices. In the northern part of the country, alcohol smuggling via Uzbekistan is a large business. Since the fall of the Taliban, various bars/outlets in Afghanistan had begun to offer alcohol to foreigners and tourists. Kabul has had an active and colorful nightlife, even compared to larger cities in other countries such as New Delhi, Karachi or Tehran. There was a large expatriate community of young and well-paid diplomats, security staff and international aid organizations. In 2010, some of outlets were searched and some Ukrainian waitresses were arrested as prostitutes. There have been several attacks on resorts and bars by Taliban militants. Tourists Foreign tourists are permitted to import two bottles or two liters of alcoholic beverages when entering Afghanistan. Foreign military troops Prior to September 2009, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) headquarters in Afghanistan had at least seven bars that served tax-free beer and wine, including a sport bar named Tora Bora. In 2009, after news of the death of 125 civilians in air strikes, General Stanley McChrystal, the head of ISAF, tried to contact troop officials. After finding that some troops were unable to adequately respond to the incident because they were drunk, he banned alcohol from the US premises. This applies as well to foreign soldiers. Alcohol was also said to have played a role in the Kandahar massacre, a 2012 incident in which a United States Army Staff Sergeant (Robert Bales) murdered sixteen civilians and wounded six others in the Panjwayi District of Kandahar Province. The US military has since banned alcohol for its troops. Despite the ban, US defense officials have sometimes found alcohol at the bases. Soldiers from other countries have been allowed to drink alcohol. Military bases of European troops usually have two liquor stores. German and French troops were allowed two small cans of beer per day in their main base. In smaller camps as in Camp Marmal, the rations were provided on a voucher base and were required to be opened at the spot to avoid the buildup of stocks. After some alcohol-related incidents in 2013, General Jörg Vollmer inspected premises personally to ensure the regulations being followed. The end of the ISAF in 2015 greatly reduced the number of foreign troops. Compared to ISAF, the current Resolute Support Mission has only a tenth of the forces present in the country. Foreign tourists are allowed to bring two liters of alcohol in a duty-free bag when entering in Afghanistan. Drunk driving and the possession of larger amounts of alcohol are subject to jail terms of several months duration. Bundeswehr alcoholic beverages shipments were addressed as well to the enlarged (German) community and invited journalists.

It initially constituted out of the local mostly Christian populations (Rum Millet), but over time members converted into Islam. For their military service, they were given privileged status (as askeri), in relation to the Rayah. Their commanders were predominantly Muslim. Tasks and privileges In the mid-15th century, after the Ottoman conquests, the martolos were used as armed police. They usually worked locally as peace-time border patrols, fortress guards, security for mines, strategic road guards (derbend), and they were occasionally used as soldiers during war, or tax collectors. They were somewhat similar to another Ottoman organization, the Voynuks, recruited in South Slavic territories, initially tasked with the defense and security, then later used as auxiliary transportation units. Due to their positions, they were allowed and able to hold timars. They received a daily wage, and askeri status, despite still being Christian. Their commanders were predominantly Muslim (martolos bashi). The duty was hereditary. They were exempted from the jizya and various local taxes. History The martolos system was adopted from the Byzantine Empire. Predominantly recruited from the Balkans, they were chosen from the land-owning Orthodox Christians, who retaining their religion, entered the askeri caste. The martolos were used as armed police in the mid-15th century, and in the following two centuries had various security tasks (see previous section). To northwestern Bosnia and parts of Croatia (sanjak of Klis and Lika) Ottomans settled Vlach which were incorporated into hereditary Christian groups of martolos and voynuks.Ivo Banac; (1984) The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics p. 43; Cornell University Press, In Ottoman Hungary and Buda area Serbs in great numbers served as martolos, which were Christian origin members largely recruited from the Vlach and Vlach like population.Kursar Vjeran; (2013) Being an Ottoman Vlach: On Vlach Identity(ies), Role and Status in Western Parts of the Ottoman Balkans (15th-18th Centuries) p. 134; .

In the 17th century, following the increase of local Christian antagonism in the Balkans, the martolos that were put against the hajduks (rebels) created hostility, with some martolos joining the rebels. Due to this, the Porte had abolished the right to Balkan Christians to serve as martolos in 1692. By 1722, the Rumelian beylerbey Osman Pasha merged the organization into the Muslim pandor (local security police). A few martolos persisted in northern Macedonia until the 19th century, then replaced by the Tanzimat reforms. Terminology The , is derived from , meaning \\"armed man, militiaman\\". Being the original word for Christians in the Ottoman army, martolos became a general word for various Christian military groups and individuals, being used by the Ottomans for Christian spies, pathfinders, messengers, Danube boatsmen, and fortress guards, as well as for the Christian rebels fighting the akinci. During Suleiman's reign (1520–66), the term was also used for local Christian police forces, especially in brigandage-infested regions of Montenegro and Morea.

The repression in the rearguard against dissenters and people felt to be inconvenient by the new Spanish authorities lasted for months on with a death toll of thousands. For the next decades in Francoist Spain, the victims remained ostracized in silence and humiliation, accompanied with an absence of liabilities to the authors of the crimes committed. Around 3,500 people died during the repression period in Navarre.  History  The Spanish Civil War began in Navarre, instigated by the Carlists and the Alfonsis monarchists. With the arrival of the new military governor in 1936, the general Emilio Mola, Navarre became a key piece in the uprising of 18 July 1936. Unlike many areas in Spain, in which the rebels faced the power of the republican authorities or left-aligned groups, the uprising in Navarre was a complete success, meeting little to no resistance. This absence of opposition did not prevent repression against the adherents and supporters of the left, resulting in many deaths. The violence affected mainly militants of the Federation of Workers of the Earth and the General Union of Workers given the predominance in the region of the Bank of Navarre, and represented mostly peasants without land. The majority of deaths came in the early months, with extrajudicial killings and removal of prisoners from custody.Diario de Noticias Fort Saint Cristóbal became a detention centre holding several hundred Republican prisoners. The detention conditions and their famous escape in May 1938, when approximately 700 prisoners broke free but were later hunted down, contributed to the number of deaths. A minor number of deaths were the result of Republican air strikes.  Violence  Tribute and plaque in memory of the teachers killed and cracked down on following the coup d'état at Pamplona The political violence unleashed after the triumph of the uprising finds its roots in the political and social situation. During this period, Navarre was mainly Catholic and Conservative. The poor economy, combined with high taxes, led to high rates of emigration.José María Jimeno Jurío's 1986 article entitled \\"Hacer la Paz\\", introductory to Navarra 1936: De la esperanza al terror. The social problems of land ownership were the major factors, as during the Republican period peasants lost access to traditional communal lands (corralizas), mainly in the south of the province, to big landowners. The political tensions led to outbursts of occasional violence and confrontations while the right was in power, given the poverty of the peasants. Other political subjects of major importance during the Republican period, such as the Basque-Navarrese Statute, were not a major factor in the repression, due to the fact that Basque Catholic identity was strong and ideological differences avoided the aggregate statute. Then and later, Francoist Spain silenced dissent and forbade public discussion of the events. Long after the installation of democracy, a number of investigations were undertaken, primarily at the behest of the victims' families. This process culminated with the publication of the extensive work Navarra 1936. De la esperanza al terror that explored the period. These studies led to the official statement of the Parliament of Navarre in 2003 that recognized the deaths during the civil war and restored the reputation of those killed.

Powell-Williams was the son of Joseph Powell Williams, a close political associate of Joseph Chamberlain, councillor and alderman in Birmingham, and Member of Parliament for Birmingham South from 1885 to his death in 1904. Powell-Williams was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, where he was in the school cricket team, and he played for Warwickshire's \\"Club and Ground\\" side from 1890 as a middle-order right-handed batsman. He played for Warwickshire in 1893, before the club was accorded first-class status, and then reappeared in five games in 1897 and 1898; he had limited success, with his highest score being 38 when he opened the second innings in the game against Gloucestershire in 1897. Further appearances were limited by his career as a barrister in London, where he lived and played club cricket at Beckenham: two of his five Warwickshire games were away matches against Kent, and his two single first-class appearances for London County in 1902 and MCC in 1905 both took place at London County's ground at Crystal Palace Park, very close to his Beckenham home.

The project closed in April 2020 with the departure of Harper from MIT, although the closure was only officially confirmed by MIT a month later in May. The project aimed to develop controlled-environment agriculture platforms called \\"Food Computers\\" that operated on a variety of scales, and which might have been used for experimental, educational, or personal use. All of the hardware, software, and data would have been open source, with the intention of creating a standardized open platform for agricultural research and experimentation. In theory, had the project succeeded, it would have enhanced transparency in the agricultural industry and made urban agriculture easier to perform, easing access to fresh foods. The OpenAg project received criticism that much of its early positive publicity was based on results that were either exaggerated or outright faked. Staff members told stories of purchasing potted plants from stores and demonstrating them as if they had been grown in \\"Food Computers\\". Gizmodo called the project a \\"Theranos for plants\\" and said that few, if any, of the Food Computers successfully grew a plant. The project was also buffeted by the resignation of Joichi Ito from the MIT Media Lab, who had helped procure much of the funding for the project.  Food Computer  The Open Agriculture Initiative coined the term \\"Food Computer\\" to describe their main product. Originally developed under the MIT CityFARM project, the Food Computer was a controlled-environment agriculture platform that used soilless agriculture technologies including hydroponic and aeroponic systems to grow crops indoors. The Food Computer also used an array of sensors to monitor the internal climate within a specialized growing chamber and adjust it so that the environmental conditions would remain consistent and optimum. The climate inside of a growing chamber was supposed to be tightly controlled to enhance food production and quality. The data on the climate conditions during a given harvest cycle could be logged online as a \\"climate recipe\\", and the phenotypic expressions (observable characteristics) of the plant could also be monitored and recorded. These recipes were recorded in an online database that was to be openly accessible so that climate conditions could be downloaded by other users around the globe. The term Food Computer was applied generally to any of the Open Agriculture Initiative's controlled-environment systems, or specifically to the smallest model, which was also called a Personal Food Computer. The tabletop-sized unit was intended for use in homes, classrooms, and small-scale experimental facilities. The mid-sized model, or Food Server, was the size of an internationally-standardized shipping container, and would utilize vertical farming structures. It was intended for use in cafeterias, restaurants, local grocers, and large-scale experimental facilities. The largest versions of the Food Computer were to be warehouse-sized Food Data Centers that would function on the level of industrial crop production. Food Computers were never commercially available. , there were six prototype Personal Food Computers operating in schools around the Boston area, and three Food Servers operating at MIT, Michigan State University, and Unidad Guadalajara (Cinvestav) in Mexico. Build directions and schematics were available for makers and hobbyists, while more-widespread availability was expected once manufacturing began.  Open Phenome Library  Various climate conditions including temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and oxygen levels, pH of water, electrical conductivity of water, and exposure to various nutrients, fertilizers, and chemicals influence whether a plant grows and also how it grows. Different climate conditions can lead to different phenotypic expressions in plants that are genotypically very similar or identical. The various traits that a plant expresses, including color, size, texture, yield, growth rate, flavor, and nutrient density, make up its phenome. OpenAg aimed to crowd source related research, and to create an open library of phenome data that relates external climate conditions to specific phenotypic expressions in various plants.  Affiliations and funding  The Open Agriculture Initiative was primarily funded through the MIT Media Lab, which was almost 100% industrially funded through corporate memberships. The Open Agriculture Initiative had also received specific endorsements from members such as IDEO, Lee Kum Kee, Target, Unilever, and Welspun. OpenAg also received additional investments and philanthropic contributions from companies and institutions unaffiliated with the Media Lab.  Criticism = Allegations of scientific misconduct  In September 2019, former employees at Fenome, the startup spun off from OpenAg, openly discussed the failure of their Food Computers to maintain the controlled environment required for growing food. They alleged that photographic results and growth data had been falsified for presentations to investors and the general public. A series of internal emails sent by Babak Babakinejad, the former lead scientist of the project, backed up these allegations. Further investigations in November showed that the Food Computers which principal investigator Harper claimed had been sent to a refugee camp for Syrian refugees in Azraq had instead been sent to a World Food Programme office in Amman, where they failed to grow food.  Environmental concerns  In September 2019, Boston radio station WBUR published a report detailing charges that the OpenAg initiative lab at MIT's Bates Research and Engineering Center in Middleton had been dumping nitrogen- laden hydroponics solution into the wastewater system at levels above the state's mandated limits of 100 ppm, leading to an investigation by the Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP). MIT was assessed a fine of $25,125 for this violation. MIT agreed to pay $15,000 and to close a wastewater injection well, and to prepare a wastewater management plan for MassDEP approval.

History The palace was initially constructed in 1520–1522, by the bishop of Bitetto, Lorenzo Serristori. The Serristori family is originally from the small Tuscan town of Figline, and the last name derives from Ser Ristoro, a local magistrate who is commemorated by a statue in thia palace's entrance stairwell. The Serristori coat of arms (1515) of the lineage above the portal facing San Niccolò and was modified by Pope Leo X, who added three lilies to the three existing stars. The original plan of the palace had a classic U shape of clear Roman derivation, with a quadrangular inside courtyard that looked over an important garden through a loggia with three arched windows. Historians suppose, by certain analogies, that the architect was Giuliano da San Gallo, active at that time in Florence. Lorenzo's nephew Averardo, a diplomat for Cosimo I de' Medici, enlarged the palace and gardens facing the Arno. During the 16th-century, the palace is further enlarged under the patronage of Antonio Serristori, governor of the Livorno port. He enlarged and transformed the \\"casa dell'orto\\" in a palace endowed with an elaborately decorated ballroom. This transformation was designed by the architect Gherardo Silvani, who was well-paid according to documents. The architect Felice Gamberai helped complete the ballroom which is flanked by three large windows surmounted by other smaller windows, and housing Murano glass chandeliers. The vaults and walls are decorated by Pier Paolo Lippi, Agnolo Gori, and Cosimo Ulivelli. In 1803, the architect Giuseppe Manetti was commissioned by then Senator Averardo Serristori to refurbish the palace. The size of the palace and gardens was reduced in size during the enlargement of the Lungarno along the river. The architect Mariano Falciani created a new river facade. In 1822 housed briefly the Count Demidoff, who then moved to the nearby Palazzo Amici- Demidoff. Joseph Bonaparte, the brother of Napoleon, lived here in exile till his death in 1844. The palace returned in the 19th century to the property of the Serristori family. The interior has a helical staircase (1650) by Gherardo Silvani.Content in this edit is translated from the existing Italian Wikipedia article at :it:Palazzo Serristori; see its history for attribution.

Jharkhand was a “laboratory” for Naxalites to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a “guerrilla zone”. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included kangaroo courts called Jan adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by Left wing extremism and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities. However, in the same year, when Jharkhand police identified 13 focus areas for combating Maoist extremism, Hazaribagh district was not one of them.

Although the concept of demarketing lacks a precise theoretical definition, it refers to an attempt by the firm to discourage all or some of its customers from making purchases either temporarily or permanently. Since the initial interests in the subject area of how to market strategically in times of shortages began, different viewpoints have been offered as to how the firm should pursue demarketing.Kofi Q. Dadzie, Georgia State University, Demarketing strategy in shortage marketing environment,JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE · FEBRUARY 1989 Definitions of Demarketing While there are many definitions of demarketing—the common thread is the intent to decrease demand. Businessdictionary.com defines demarketing as: Efforts aimed at discouraging (not destroying) the demand for a product which (1) a firm cannot supply in large-enough quantities, or (2) does not want to supply in a certain region where the high costs of distribution or promotion allow only a too little profit margin. Common demarketing strategies include higher prices, scaled- down advertising, and product redesign.http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/demarketing.html#ixzz3n5fazLTm According to Websters dictionary, demarketing is “The use of advertising to decrease demand for a product that is in short supply.”http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/demarketing A few other definitions include one from DictionaryReference.com: “Advertising that urges the public to limit the consumption of a product, as at a time of shortage. Companies can lessen input cost to the product so that the consumer may not buy from them and choose other alternative product since the quality is lessen. Companies can then allot the saved money to other products they offer to gain more sales”http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/demarketing The All Business dictionary defines demarketing as: Marketers attempt to reduce the demand for a product when the demand for the product is greater than the manufacturer's ability to produce it.http://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary- demarketing-4966214-1.html History While demarketing may seem relatively new, it has in fact been around for decades. In 1971 Phillip Kotler and Sidney Levy introduced the expression “demarketing” in a Harvard Business Review article titled “Demarketing, Yes, Demarketing.” Later in 1973, another article appeared in the Journal of Marketing by Phillip Kotler. Here, Dr. Kotler elaborated on the “current demand level” and the “desired demand level” in the context of marketing. There is “underdemand, adequate demand, and overdemand.” Each demand situation requires different marketing approaches and corresponding tasks. Specifically, where there is overdemand, the marketing task is to reduce demand by “demarketing.” While demarketing reduces the demand without impugning the product, “countermarketing” seeks to destroy the demand for a product that is “unwholesome” on its face, such as “vice” products. Kotler also used the term “unsell” which “may also be viewed as an effort to sell something else.” Ahead of his time, Kotler observed “unselling (or demarketing) has as much social justification in a democracy as does selling.” Kotler also seemed to have anticipated the rise of “behavioral economics” when he observed in 1973 that “Efforts to turn off demand can profitably draw on certain concepts and theories in psychology” specifically, deconditioning, habit extinction theory, and learning and reinforcement theory. In 2011, Dr. Kotler teamed up with R. Craig Lefebvre to write Design Thinking, Demarketing and Behavioral Economics: Fostering Interdisciplinary Growth in Social Marketing. “As the growing number of governments, businesses and private funding sources focus on conditions of consumer excess, we see the social marketing paradigm expanding to accommodate this cultural shift to an Age of Demarketing.” Reasons for Demarketing According to Lefebvre and Kotler (2011) “Demarketing can be viewed as blending all 4Ps of the marketing mix and also aiming for policy changes to nudge and sustain healthier and more socially responsible behavioral choices… (and) deeper understanding of the people we wish to serve, the environments in which they make choices, the market research we conduct and the programs we implement.” Mikl ́os-Thal and Juanjuan (2011) proposed that sellers use demarketing to strategically manage buyers’ quality perceptions. They observed that consistent with ostensible demarketing, Cialdini (1985) suggests a psychological tendency for humans to want things that are less available. Amaldoss and Jain (2005) show that limited availability satisfies consumers’ need for uniqueness, and Stock and Balachander (2005) demonstrate that scarcity can signal high quality.Mikl ́os- Thal, J. and Zhang Juanjuan (2011). Strategic Demarketing. University of California, San Diego, Faculty Seminars. Since the invent of demarketing in the 1970s, many different strategies for implementing demarketing have evolved. Traditionally in marketing--which seeks to grow the consumer base and increase the demand for a product or service--the 4 P's are product, price, place/distribution and promotion. The logic then follows that demarketing would adapt this structure to serve the opposite purpose of reducing the consumer base and discouraging demand for a product and service. Instead of increasing availability of a product or service, a demarketing strategy would be to actually restrict availability. Furthermore, demarketing would seek to increase availability of the alternatives and highlight the downside of the product or service, therefore making it less attractive to consumers. To demarket in the pricing arena, the taxes or price might increase with the purpose of shrinking the demand. Advertising can be minimized or eliminated. The placement of a product/service or the size of the consumption space can be strategically changed to reduce the likelihood of consumption. Another strategy would be to promote behavior that does not require the product or service being demarketed.Shiu, E. L. (2009). Demarketing tobacco through governmental policies – The 4Ps revisited. Journal of Business Research, 62, 269-278. Demarketing strategies may differ when being used by a private firm versus a government entity. Social marketing strategies have been widely implemented to demarket products or services that are perceived to be harmful or costly to society. Traditional marketing principles also apply to social marketing, which is used to advance or depress a social idea, cause or behavior. Instead of talking about products, social marketing makes a proposition. Instead of discussing placement of a service or product, it deals with accessibility to those services or products. In place of promotion social marketing uses social communication to spread ideas. Rather than price, the costs of involvement are highlighted by social marketing in ways that support their marketing or demarketing message.Peattie, K. P. (2009). Social marketing: A pathway to consumption reduction? Journal of Business Research, 62, 260-268. Demarketing activities discourage demand. This stands in sharp contrast to the objectives of marketing: create utility and enhance exchanges. In their provocative article \\"Demarketing, Yes, Demarketing,\\" Kotler and Levy (1971) distinguish three types of demarketing situations. General demarketing General demarketing occurs when a seller shrinks the level of total demand. Suppliers of electricity and water use advertisements and publicity campaigns during periods of excess demand. Selective demarketing Selective demarketing occurs when a company discourages demand from certain classes of consumers. Adult communities demarket properties to families with children, and producers of goods with a snob appeal avoid low- image retailers. Ostensible demarketing Ostensible demarketing occurs when a seller creates an artificial or perceived shortage to whet consumer appetites. Limited distribution of goods may induce consumers to stockpile these “hard-to-get\\" items. Although Kotler and Levy (1971) emphasized the need for careful research into these phenomena, little effort has been devoted to the formal study of demarketing by marketers. This is not surprising, as marketers are trained to build demand rather than destroy it. Strategies=Price discriminating demarketing Salop (1977), Chiang and Spatt (1982), Narasimhan (1984), and Gerstner and Holthausen (1986) have shown that price discriminating firms may create transaction costs deliberately to discourage consumers from seeking the lowest price. Busy consumers pay higher prices, whereas those with small transaction costs pay lower prices. For example, some retailers hold \\"3-hour sales\\" from 8 to 11 Saturday morning. Consumers who get to the store before 11:00 am pay lower prices but incur the inconvenience of early morning shopping. Busy consumers who want a time-convenient product may pay a higher price for that product, so a firm may make the more convenient product more expensive. Bait and switch demarketing The bait-and-switch demarketing strategy is when a firm advertises one product in such a way that the intention is not that the consumers buy that product, but that they buy a more profitable product in its place. Gerstner and Hess (1990) and Chu, Gerstner and Hess (1992) studied disparagement of products in sales presentations or in point of-purchase displays that are designed to discourage consumers from buying featured brands. These practices, however, might be illegal. Stock outage demarketing Another known demarketing strategy is stock outage demarketing, where a firm actually plans a stock outage. Stock outages frustrate consumers, but stores often offer rain checks that guarantee delivery at a future date. Nevertheless, Hess and Gerstner (1987) showed that stores might profit from planned stock outages with rain checks because customers may visit the stores twice and buy complementary products on each visit. Balachander and Farquhar (1991) showed that deliberate stock outages help stores charge higher prices and earn higher profits. The possibility of a stock outage in one store makes customers more eager to buy when the other store has the product in stock. Crowding costs demarketing Crowding cost demarketing is a strategy implemented on “Black Friday” when crowds will deter many consumers from purchasing a product at a lower price. Retail stores, hotels, and airlines have limited capacities. A low price usually attracts large numbers of shoppers, so customers must hunt for space in crowded parking lots and stand in long checkout lines. Businesses may deliberately accept capacity constraints, recognizing that some customers would trade the higher prices for reduced crowding. Gerstner (1986) derived symmetric equilibrium prices and crowding costs in such markets. Differentiation Demarketing On the other hand, there has been growing scholarly interest in issues that can be construed as demarketing. There are numerous specific strategies for demarketing that would fall within the 4 P's definitions, although the demarketing terminology is not used. Eitan Gerstner, James Hess and Wujin Chu discuss a few of them in their 1993 article, “Demarketing as a Differentiation Strategy”. The differentiation strategy means that a firm might use a “nuisance factor” that actually drives consumers away from them, and into the arms of their competitors in order to keep their prices elevated. This can also be used to avoid a price war with that competitor. Examples=Healthcare An example of demarketing in action is the demarketing of healthcare consumption that occurred in Canada in the 1990s. Canada's social healthcare system was under stress from overuse or inefficient use. In order to combat these issues, Dr. Gurprit Kindra, from the University of Ottawa made strategic suggestions in an article he wrote in 1995. Kindra suggested that some co-payments and user fees be applied to discourage consumption. He also proposed that a system geared toward more managed care would reduce the number of services being accessed if patients were required to get a referral from a primary point of contact before seeing other specialties. Among his other suggestions were health promotion and education for the general public that would encourage less utilization of the healthcare services and reducing the convenience to patients by restricting access to free or deeply discounted services like Canada's publicly subsidized urgent care facilities and instead make available privatized fast-lane services for those consumers who are willing to pay more.Kindra, G. S. (1995, Summer). Demarketing Inappropriate Healthcare Consumption: Canada's prized health care system suffers from chronic overuse. Journal of Healthcare Marketing, 15(2), 10-14.Borkowski, N. M.

Cigarettes as a “Vice” Product While demarketing may be employed to decrease demand, countermarketing seeks to destroy demand. Strategies include promoting anti-smoking/health themes, taxes on tobacco products, imposing mandatory warning labels, decreasing advertising spaces, increasing pricing, and restricting the consumption space in favor of nicotine patches, Nicorette gum, and Nicorette lozenges. Unintended Outcomes Research points to behavioral reactions to anti-drug ads that go in the opposite direction from that which was intended. In other words, a boomerang effect occurs where greater levels of exposure to anti-drug campaign results in potentially increased use of drugs. The thinking is that anti-drug publicity may convey the idea that “everyone’s doing it.” In addition, it is possible that the ads had an unintended positive impact on perceptions towards drugs by portraying “benefits” associated with using, an association possibly strengthened by repeated exposure to messages and images suggesting the \\"good-times\\" people have while on drugs. Beliefs and behaviors of youths were also affected by perceptions regarding older peers. Further, ABC News reported findings in 2008 that the federal government's effort to keep youngsters from using drugs “is unlikely to have had favorable effects on youths.” State government efforts have also come under criticism. A December, 2008, article in Science Daily about an effort by the state of Montana states: “An independent review investigating the effectiveness of a publicly funded graphic anti-methamphetamine advertising campaign has found that the campaign has been associated with many negative outcomes.” Who is Winning the War on Drugs?

Early life  George Farquhar Leslie was born on 19 August 1820 at Rayne in Aberdeenshire, the son of William Leslie, the local laird, and Jane Davidson.Scotland, Select Births and Baptisms, 1564–1950  New South Wales pastoralist  In 1838 he migrated to New South Wales, where he helped finance his brother Patrick's Darling Downs expedition. He managed sheep for Phillip Parker King, and then farmed land at the Darling Downs. In 1840 his brother Patrick, married Catherine (Kate) Macarthur, daughter of Hannibal Macarthur (a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council) and granddaughter of Philip Gidley King (former Governor of New South Wales). On 2 December 1847, George Leslie married Catherine's sister Emmeline Maria Macarthur at All Saints Church, Parramatta, New South Wales.

He retired from the Legislative Council in February 1855. He was an active advocate for the separation of Queensland as a separate colony, and he was a strong supporter that the boundary of the new colony should be at latitude 30°S which would include both the Clarence and Darling Downs districts in the new colony. However, the border between Queensland and New South wales was established between 28-29°S and the Clarence district remained part of New South Wales. His brother Patrick was briefly a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1857.  Later life  Leslie retired to England due to ill health in 1855. He died from an attack of haemorrhage of the lungs on 22 June 1860 at Farnborough House in Hampshire, England.

The report is a publication of series in every two years with a specific theme at one time, based on China's critical energy strategies, aiming to provide scientific and technical support for public and private policy decisions. 2014 saw the release of its fifth installment. Released reports * China Energy Report (2006): Strategy and Policy Research * China Energy Report (2008): CO2 Emissions Research * China Energy Report (2010): Energy Efficiency Research * China Energy Report (2012): Energy Security Research * China Energy Report (2014): Energy Poverty Research Review of reports=China Energy Report (2014): Energy Poverty Research The 2014 Report is the fifth in a series of such reports. It is based on the fact that China, as the largest developing country, has been challenged with the more serious and more complicated energy poverty issue. This report reviews and summarizes the tools and methods of evaluating the global energy poverty, then establishes an indicator system of measuring and assessing China's energy poverty from a temporal and spatial perspective. Besides, many critical issues like the relations between energy poverty and economic growth, climate change and energy accessibility, clean energy and energy poverty, solid fuels and health, policies and acts on energy poverty elimination, are also discussed in this report. China Energy Report (2012): Energy Security Research China has been more relying on the import of fossil fuels since 2009 soon after China became the biggest energy consumer and second largest oil importer, giving rise to more crisis and risks. Under such circumstances, the 2012 Report systematically discusses a series of topics pertaining to energy security, such as the complexity of the global energy market, risks assessment of China's energy import, policies for strategic energy reserves, energy crisis and China's economic growth, renewables and energy poverty, the environmental and health effects of energy consumption, energy conservation potentials for key sectors and regions, energy supply security warning and studies of international energy security. China Energy Report (2010): Energy Efficiency Research Energy, followed by CO2 emissions, is not only an environmental problem, but recognized as an economic, political, and social strategic issue. In a global path of sustainable development, it is aware that achieving energy conservation as well as energy efficiency improvements is one of the most important and effective way to address climate change and energy challenges. The 2010 Report proposes the connotation as well as the measurements of energy efficiency based on a comprehensive study of international energy situation. It is well extended to several analyses such as the effects of economic structure on the macro energy efficiency, the difference between urban and rural residential energy consumption and characteristics of regional residential energy consumption, energy efficiency of major industries and sectors, the effects of fuel price on oil demand, energy efficiency policy design, and simulation. China Energy Report (2008): CO2 Emissions Research The global climate change has posed a hard question of how to use fossil fuels wisely to human beings. In this context, the 2008 Report focuses on energy use and CO2 emissions. the characteristics of China's energy consumption and CO2 emissions, factors of CO2 emissions under different economic growth levels, the emissions trajectory of China's carbon-intensive sectors and regions, global carbon market, mitigation technologies and policies. China Energy Report (2006): Strategy and Policy Research Energy has been considered same as labor and capital, a basic productive factor and strategic resource. The 2006 Report, the first installment of the series, focuses on China's energy strategies and management and provides implications according to different policy portfolios. References *Y. M. Wei, H.

About  David Wiseman, Lost Valley Mirror, 2019, courtesy of Wiseman Studio Wiseman was described as “producing the most inspired decorative art in America.\\" His work ranges from expansive site-specific installations to unique and editioned furniture and scultpural lighting. He has “internalized centuries of global design, and the resulting, exquisitely detailed creations—whimsical confabulations of metal, porcelain, and crystal—are deeply rooted in his love of the natural world. Designer and head of art fair Design Miami Rodman Primack says Wiseman “is not afraid of the decorative, as this is not a pejorative term for him, nor is he afraid of outright beauty.”David Wiseman, Lost Valley Mirror (detail), 2019, courtesy of Wiseman StudioIn a review of his 2015 show Wilderness and Ornament, Artsy notes, “Bronze and porcelain are used to preserve otherwise fleeting moments, like the ephemeral bloom of a cherry blossom, a cracked egg, the twisted form of a lily of the valley, or a hanging hare after the hunt.” Wiseman credits his awe for nature as his motivating inspiration: \\"I have always been drawn to nature in my work,\\" he says. \\"And within the natural world, magnificent patterns abound, from crystalline structures to honeycombs, and cell formations to ocean swells.\\" His motifs transcend even these, calling on decorative wood carvings, mosque adornments and more across cultures and time periods. Admiration for designers who were part of the Vienna Secession, like Dagobert Peche and Josef Hoffman; the French artist duo Les Lalanne; as well as traditional patterns from India, France, Korea, and Japan are a large part of Wiseman’s inspiration. “A century ago artists found a way to make ornament relevant to contemporary life, before postwar standardization wiped it away,” Wiseman says. “I’d like to make it relevant again.”  Career  Born September 11, 1981 and raised in Pasadena, California. Wiseman received his BFA degree in Furniture Design from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2003. David Wiseman, Cielo de las Granadas, Installation, 2007, courtesy of Wiseman Studio David Wiseman, Radial Branch Chandelier, 2016, courtesy of Wiseman Studio While still in school, Wiseman began selling his wall-mounted Deer Hat Hanger in Los Angeles and New York boutiques. His senior thesis, titled Wall Forest, included the deer heads alongside a selection of resin-cast tree branches that appeared to emerge from the walls, and in 2007 was featured in DAAB Books' compendium Wall Design. In 2005, after a brief stint in New York, Wiseman returned to Los Angeles where he created his first porcelain and plaster ceiling installation in a private residence in Hancock Park, Los Angeles. This ceiling was commissioned by the clients’ decorator, Rodman Primack formerly Director of Design Miami, whom Wiseman has maintained a close working relationship. Wiseman describes his subsequent exploration into creating bespoke ceiling installations as “porcelain and plaster canopies of branches—trees that looked like they were emerging through the surface of the wall. Those branches evolved into chandeliers, and that led to a whole other body of work.” From this initial project, he has developed a robust studio, creating lighting, sculpture, furniture. In 2020 Wiseman was recognized by Architectural Digest France as one of the 100 great artists and designers and in 2019, Galerie Magazine included Wiseman as one of their selected Creative Minds.  Studio  In 2017, together with his brother, Ari Wiseman the former Deputy Director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation founded Wiseman Studio. Together they run an independent studio that manages the work of David Wiseman, promoting sales, collaborations, and ventures with galleries, museums, and educational organizations. A 30,000-square-foot multi-building former factory complex in Los Angeles’s Frogtown district designed by Ted Porter of Ryall Porter Sheridan Architects — will present exhibitions of David Wiseman’s sculpture and allow access to his process, including bronze casting and porcelain fabrication.  Artworks and exhibitions  David Wiseman, Bowerbird Table, 2019, courtesy of Wiseman Studio Wiseman’s work was institutionally recognized in 2006, with the inclusion of his “Cherry Blossom Canoy” installation at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum’s National Design Triennial, Design Life Now, described by Cooper-Hewitt curator Brooke Hodge as “exquisite, almost Rococo.” In 2008, Wiseman began exhibiting with R & Company, a Manhattan-based design gallery representing contemporary and historical designers, where his first two solo shows were held - David Wiseman in 2012, and Wilderness and Ornament in 2015. David Wiseman, Bowerbird Table (detail), 2019, courtesy of Wiseman Studio In 2019, Kasmin Gallery (New York, New York) presented a solo exhibition of Wiseman’s work, titled Plants, Minerals, and Animals, which featured works reflecting his fascination with the natural world, global decorative arts traditions, and a reverence for honoring timeless craft techniques. The exhibition presented bronze and terrazzo furniture, a monumental mirror, limited edition wallpaper, and sculptural chandeliers. His work has been acquired by Corning Museum of Glass (Corning, NY), Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Los Angeles, CA), the Rhode Island School of Design Museum (Providence, RI), and Wunsch Americana Foundation (New York, NY). In addition to the 2006 Design Triennial at the Cooper-Hewitt, Wiseman's work was exhibited in 2014 at the Bernardaud Foundation in Limoges, France. More recently, his work was shown at international art and design fairs such as ART021 (Shanghai), Design Miami (Miami and Basel, Switzerland), FOG Art and Design (San Francisco), The Salon Art+Design (New York City), Collective Design Fair (New York City), and Zona Maco (Mexico City), and has been displayed in collaborative exhibitions at Friedman Benda and Gallery Seomi (Seoul).  Notable projects  David Wiseman, Lily of the Valley Mirror and Ceiling for Dior, Installation, 2011, courtesy of Wiseman Studio David Wiseman, Collage Chandelier for Rhode Island School of Design, 2014, courtesy of Wiseman Studio Much of Wiseman’s work consists of private commissions for residences across the country and internationally. In 2013, Wiseman's Branch Illuminated Sculpture was chosen for U.S Embassy in Madrid, Spain, by designer Michael S. Smith, as part of the Art in Embassies program. For a wall installation in a private residence from 2010, he worked closely with a family to develop a site-specific installation that referenced their history - a literal family tree represented by blossoming wisteria vines twining around a linden tree, and crowned by a porcelain owl. Wendi Murdoch, a collector of Wiseman’s who commissioned a plaster and porcelain ginkgo motif for her ceiling, said, “David captures nature in the most beautiful and elegant way, using old-world techniques and craftsmanship, but with a modern twist.” In 2010, commissioned by decorator Peter Marino, he created a signature porcelain Lily of the Valley vine installation for Dior flagship stores in New York, Shanghai, and Tokyo. As a notable alumnus, Wiseman was invited to create a site specific illuminated sculptural installation in the dining room of the President's residence at Rhode Island School of Design and has completed numerous other chandelier installations worldwide.  Collaborations = Glacier collection  In 2006, Wiseman teamed up with renowned Bohemian glass artisans at Artel Glass in Prague to create a series of faceted blown-crystal pieces. The Glacier collection includes small vodka glasses, whiskey tumblers, sconces, vases, and hanging pendant lamps. Artel sells these items from their store in Prague, and Wiseman’s studio sources them for inclusion in his Collage Chandeliers and other pieces.  Scent pieces  Wiseman collaborated with Haley Alexander Van Oosten, an LA-based scent designer and founder of artisan perfumery L’Oeil du Vert, to create a scent-diffusing objet d'art with three separate custom scent options. Together, they also created a spherical, pebble-textured gold- or silver-plated box containing “gems” of scent-soaked ebony. Wiseman created the Lost Valley Grotto in which the monkey holds out his hand which serves as a well for a custom fragrance made with essential oil.  Rugs  In 2014, Milan-based rug manufacturer Amini and R & Company put together a collaboration between artists represented by the gallery and artisan Tibetan weavers working from Kathmandu, Nepal. Wiseman’s original rug design was based on his bronze Garden Gate Doors, and integrated many of his signature patterns and motifs, including branches and a small bird, but Wiseman says that “after spending some time with [the weavers] and visiting their spiritual places, I integrated some of their patterns. The clouds on the bottom right corner of the rug appear on their temples and textiles.” The limited-edition rugs, in two color-ways of indigo and gold, and Delftware-inspired blue and white, debuted at Design Miami in December 2014. In 2017, Wiseman created another Paradise Rug as part of the same collaboration, which was an extra-large asymmetrical organically shaped carpet with animal and bird motifs amongst rivers and stones in a blue and grey palette.  Huevos de Los Angeles  In 2014, Wiseman collaborated with friend and fellow RISD grad Adam Silverman, former director of Heath Ceramics, to begin their ongoing series, Huevos de Los Angeles. The collaboration to date has consisted of a series of Silverman’s self-described “'lumpy, maybe beautiful” ceramic eggs interacting with Wiseman’s customized bronze elements, in what the artists term “transformations of Fabergé eggs. Several of the eggs are wrapped in Wiseman’s Islamic jali inspired tracery pattern, while holes in the surface of another egg cradle snugly-nestled, highly polished studs of bronze. The first pair of the series was exhibited at Wallpaper* magazine’s Handmade installation at Salone del Mobile in Milan. They were later acquired by the Rhode Island School of Design Museum.  Dior Lady Art project  December, 2018. After collaborating with the House by sculpting lily-of-the-valley ceilings and mirrors for the boutiques in Shanghai, Tokyo and New York, he conceived two creations as part of the Dior Lady Art project. The large bag was made of hand cut leather that approximated his bronze collage patterned screens. A medium bag had Dior gray lambskin stitched with a mix of cannage and floral patterns, and embellished the charms with lily-of-the-valley buds in porcelain-effect metal inspired by Monsieur Dior's favorite flower and Wiseman's signature ceilings. KILLSPENCER x David Wiseman Fletcher Briefcase Partnering with longtime friend and industrial designer Spencer Nikosey of KILLSPENCER, Wiseman co-created the Fletcher Briefcase, a limited-edition briefcase made of bullhide leather and a top handle made of cast bronze and inlaid terrazzo that features petrified wood. Released April 2020.  Selected press  Wiseman’s work has been featured in The New York Times, T Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, Architectural Digest, The Financial Times, LA Times, Town and Country, 1st Dibs, Departures magazine, Artsy, the Huffington Post, The Robb Report, among others.

Early Years  Foster was the son of John Foster (1758–1816), a farmer and landowner of Armitstead Hall, Settle, Yorkshire, England, and his wife Jane, née Dowbiggin. He was the younger brother of John Foster (1792-1875). Both John and William studied as boarders at Heath School in Halifax; William then moved on to study at Cambridge University before qualifying as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn Fields in London. William Foster would have probably pursued a career in England but his father's death, at the age of 57, occurred just after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and coincided with a severe decline in England's rural economy that depressed product and land values for over a decade. Debts had previously been incurred in efforts to expand and develop the family estate but interest payments, together with falling returns from produce and difficulty in collecting rent from tenants, placed major pressures on the family's finances. For William, pressures were increased by the needs of establishing himself in his career as a lawyer. New South Wales  In 1827, one of Foster's colleagues, Alexander Baxter, was offered the position of Attorney General of New South Wales. Foster decided to travel with him and migrated to Sydney, intending to continue his career as a barrister but, within a month, he was appointed to the newly created post of Solicitor General. Baxter was a dashing figure but totally incompetent as a lawyer and relied heavily on Foster to perform his duties. In 1829 Foster was appointed chairman of the Courts of Quarter Sessions. In 1838 Foster, along with William à Beckett and Richard Windeyer, defended the 11 colonists charged with murder in relation to the Myall Creek massacre. From 1843 to 1845 he was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. William's brother, John, had already migrated to Tasmania in 1822, together with their mother and youngest brother, Henry. John was also a politician and was elected to the Tasmanian Legislative Council as the member for Huon from 1868 to 1874.  Private Life  Foster married Mary Anne Green in 1817. They had four children. After Mary Anne died in 1856, he married Angelina Job, with whom he had a son, born in England in 1859.  Return to England  Foster returned to England in 1854 and settled in Brighton but his first wife, Mary Anne died only two years later and he remarried in 1858. After what appears to have been a happy retirement, Foster died at his home in Brighton on 2 February 1866, aged 72.

This line includes the SDS 910, SDS 920, SDS 925, SDS 930, SDS 940, and the SDS 945. The SDS 9300 is an extension of the 9xx architecture. The 1965 SDS 92 is an incompatible 12-bit system built using monolithic integrated circuits. The 910 and 920 were first shipped in August, 1962. The 9300 was announced in June, 1963. The 925 and 930 were announced in 1964. The 940 was announced in 1965, and the 945 in 1968. The 9 series was replaced by the SDS Sigma series. General description All systems are 24-bit single address machines. Programmer-accessible registers are A (accumulator), B (extension), X (index), and P (program counter—14 bits), plus an overflow indicator. The 9300 has three index registers X1 through X3 which can be used as base registers to allow access to memory above 16K words. The W and Y registers are used for input/output. Maximum address space is 214 or 16,384 words (16 KW—64 K char) on the 910 and 920; The 9300, 930, and 940 support up to 32K (128 K char), although the method of accessing additional memory varies. Data formats Fixed point data is 24-bits, two's complement, big-endian. Floating point is implemented in software using \\"programmed operators\\", except on the SDS 9300 which has hardware floating point. All floating point data is 48 bits, Single precision uses a 24-bit signed fraction and a 9-bit signed exponent, double precision uses a 39-bit fraction and a 9-bit exponent. Both the exponent and the fraction are stored in big-endian twos-complement format. The binary point is assumed to be immediately left of the high-order bit of the fraction. The value of the number is \`F*2E\`, where F is the fraction and E is the exponent. The floating point formats are: Double precision floating point +-+-----------------------+ ± Fraction  high-order word +-+-----------+-+---------+  frac(cont) ±exponent  low-order word +-------------+-+---------+ bit 0 1 2 5 3 High-order word: bit 0 fraction sign bits 1-23 high-order part of fraction Low-order word: bits 0-14 low-order part of fraction bit 15 exponent sign bits 16-23 exponent Single precision floating point +-+-----------------------+ ± Fraction  high-order word +-+-----------+-+---------+  not used ±exponent  low-order word +-------------+-+---------+ bit 0 1 2 5 3 The format is the same as double precision except that only 24 bits of fraction are used. Address generation For address generation, indexing, if specified, is performed before indirection. The word at the effective indirect address is decoded as if it were an instruction (except that the instruction code is ignored), allowing an indirect address to also specify indirection or indexing. Multiple levels of indirect addressing are allowed. Programmed operators The programmed operator facility allows the instruction code field to indicate a call to a vector of subroutine addresses. The six bit instruction code allows up to 64 programmed operators (octal 00 through 77). If the P bit is set, an instruction code of xx is treated as a call to location 1xx (octal). The location of the POP instruction is saved in location zero. Bit zero of location zero is set to the current value of the overflow indicator and the indicator is reset. Bit 9 of location zero is set to '1'b to indicate an indirect address, allowing the programmed operator routine to indirectly access the data specified in the address of the POP instruction. SDS 910 Main memory on the 910 is 2048 to 16384 words of magnetic-core memory with a cycle time of 8 μs. A fixed-point add instruction takes 16 μs, a fixed-point multiply takes 248 μs. Two hardware interrupts are standard with up to 896 more optional. The instruction format for the 910 and 920 systems is as follows: +-+-+-+------+-+--------------+ 0XPOpcodeI Address  +-+-+-+------+-+--------------+ 1 2 bit 0 1 2 3 8 9 0 3 Bits 0-2 are called the \\"tag\\" Bit 0 is always zero. Bit 1 '1'b indicates that the operand address is to be indexed. Bit 2 '1'b indicates that this instruction is a programmed operator (POP). Bits 3-8 is the instruction code or programmed-operator id. Bit 9 '1'b indicates that the operand address shall be indirected (indexing preceding indirecting), potentially recursively. Bits 10-23 Contain the operand address. The SDS 910 weighed about . SDS 920 Main memory on the 920 is 4096 to 16384 words of magnetic core memory. The fixed-point add time is the same as the 910 (16 μs), but the fixed-point multiply is roughly twice as fast at 128 μs. The 920 can have up to 1024 priority interrupts. The 920 weighed about . SDS 930 The 930 offers a \\"memory extension system\\" that allows addressing more than 16284 words. Two 3-bit \\"Extend Memory Registers\\", called EM2 and EM3, are provided which can be loaded with a value to be used as the high- order three bits of the effective address. Addresses 000008–177778 (the first 8192 words of memory) are always unmodified. If the high-order octal digit of the address in the instruction is two the contents of EM2 replaces the high- order digit in the effective address; when the digit is three the contents of EM3 are used. To retain compatibility with earlier models. when the computer is started the value in EM2 is set to 2 and EM3 to 3, allowing programs to address the first 16384 words of memory. These registers can be loaded by the program. The program loader uses the high-order bit of the instruction, ignored by all models, as a flag indicating that the instruction currently being loaded is to be relocated. 930 memory has a cycle time of 1.75 μs. A fixed-point add takes 3.5 μs, and a fixed-point multiply 7.0 μs. The priority interrupt system allows 2–38 input/output interrupts and up to 896 system interrupts. The instruction format for the 930 system is compatible with prior systems except for the bits used for extended memory: +-+-+-+------+-+--+----------+ 0XPOpcodeIEM Address  +-+-+-+------+-+--+----------+ bit 0 1 2 3 3 9 11 1 2 01 2 3 Bits 10 and 11 specify either no extended memory (EM='00'b—references first 8K words of memory) or prepend the contents of EM2 (EM='10'b) or EM3 (EM='11'b) to form the effective address. SDS 940 The 940 adds modes of operation to support multiple users. The operating mode of previous models is renamed normal mode. A new monitor mode limits access to input/output and certain privileged instructions. A user mode is used to run users' application programs. A set of memory map registers is used to map virtual addresses to physical. There are eight memory map registers, each mapping 2K words, to provide an address space of 16K. The instruction format for normal mode is the same as for the 930. Addressing differs between user mode and monitor mode. SDS 940 user mode instruction format: +-+-+-+------+-+---+---------+ UXPOpcodeIBlk Address  +-+-+-+------+-+---+---------+ bit 0 1 2 3 3 9 1 1 2 0 3 3 Bit 0 is ignored in user mode unless bit position 2 (P) indicates that this is a programmed operator. In this case a '1'b in bit position 0 indicates that this is a \\"system POP\\", or \\"SYSPOP\\", instead of a standard programmed operator. In user mode bit positions 10–12 \\"constitute a virtual memory block number\\", that is specify a memory map register, and bits 13–23 \\"specify a location within the virtual memory block.\\" The contents of the memory map register are prepended to instruction bits 13–23 to form the effective address. Memory map The 940 accesses memory through a memory mapThe use of memory map registers was carried forward to the 32-bit Sigma computers. to provide virtual memory. The map formats differ slightly between a user memory map and a monitor memory map. For programs running in user mode, the high-order three bits of the address field of an instruction serve as an index to an array of eight registers (R0-R7).Physically the memory map is contained in two 24-bit registers RL1 and RL2, each of which is set and cleared as a unit. Each register contains a 5-bit value (Rn) which is prepended to the low-order 11 bits of the instruction address field to form the 16-bit physical address. This divides virtual memory logically into eight blocks of 2048 words each. The registers allow access to 16K words at any one time out of a possible 32K words of physical memory. A sixth bit (Pn) in each register indicates a read- only block of storage. Rn=0 and Pn=1 indicates an unassigned block, and any reference causes a trap. The map registers can only be set in monitor mode. The memory map for monitor mode is similar. There are no P bits; the R0–R5 equivalents, called M0–M5, contain the read-only values 0–5, providing direct access to physical addresses 0–8K-1 (00000–177778). For addresses in the range 8K–12K-1 (20000–277778) memory extension register EM2 is used to form the physical address as it is in normal mode. For addresses 12K–16K-1 (30000–377778) the contents of memory map registers M6 and M7 are used to form the address. The monitor can use either the monitor memory map or the user memory map, determined by the value of bit 0 of the instruction. This allows the monitor access to the user's address space. System programmed operators In user mode, programmed operators function the same as normal mode, accessing the user's virtual locations 100-1778. The 940 also includes a facility to execute System Programmed operators (SYSPOPS), used to call monitor services. When a SYSPOP is encountered in user mode (instruction bits 0 and 2 are '1'b), the computer first enters monitor mode and then accesses the vector of instructions at the monitor's (physical) 100-1778. SDS 945 The 945 is an upgrade of the 940 time-sharing system. It was advertised as being able to \\"support up to 24 simultaneous users and up to 64 authorized users.\\" MAGPAK The MAGPAK 9446 tape drive subsystem and associated 9401 tape cartridge was developed by SDS for the SDS 900 series and announced in May 1964 Each tape drive unit consists of two independently controlled magnetic tape drives mounted on a standard 10½-inch by 19-inch panel. Data are recorded at 7.5 inches per second and 1,400 bits per inch. The 9448 Tape Control Unit connects the tape drive unit to any Series 900 system. The tape cartridge contains approximately 600 feet of Mylar tape with two independent tracks each holding approximately 1.5 million IBM characters (6 bits plus parity) yielding a capacity of approximately 4 million six bit characters per cartridge. Software The primary operating system for the line, excluding the 940 and 945, is the MONARCH operating system. MONARCH is a single-task batch operating system. Originally resident on magnetic tape, later versions can reside on a head-per-track magnetic disk called a RAD (Rapid Access Data) File. MONARCH is not an executive system, since application programs have control of all the resources of the computer when running. Instead it is a monitor, providing job-to-job transition and supporting services to applications. Other standard system routines that are included in the monitor are: * The MONARCH Loader * The MONARCH update routine * Standard input/output subroutines * The Meta-Symbol assembler * FORTRAN II compiler By 1969 an ALGOL 60 compiler was available.

It fought its first battles at the Yelnya Salient, participating in that early Soviet success before being swept up in Operation Typhoon, encircled and destroyed. At the very end of 1941 the division was reformed. It served on mostly inactive sectors during 1942, but in 1943 it played an important role in containing the offensive of 4th Panzer Army at Kursk. It followed this in September with one of the first successful assault crossings of the Dniepr River, for which many men of the 309th were named as Heroes of the Soviet Union. The division continued in combat through Ukraine, Poland and Silesia before ending the war near Breslau.  1st Formation  The division began forming on July 10, 1941 at Kursk in the Oryol Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 76 Col. Nikifor Alekseevich Ilyantzev was assigned to command on that date, and he would be the only commanding officer of the 1st Formation. The division's basic order of battle was as follows: * 955th Rifle Regiment * 957th Rifle Regiment * 959th Rifle Regiment * 842nd Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December, 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, 1996, p. 70 Less than a month after forming, the 309th was assigned to Reserve Front, moving to 24th Army of that Front on August 5, just as that Army was itself forming up. Its first divisional headquarters was established at Gordunovka. By the end of August the fresh division had arrived at the front and took part in the third counteroffensive against the Yelnya Salient, beginning on August 30. The division was assigned to the central shock group, intended to hold the German forces in the salient while it was pinched off by the northern and southern groups. Attacking alongside the 19th Rifle Division, the 309th made almost no headway on the first three days. At the end of September 1 it was shifted, as previously planned, to reinforce the 107th Motorized Division of the northern group. It was still regrouping in its new positions on September 3 when Army Group Center ordered a withdrawal of its forces from the salient, which was carried out over the next four days. General G.K. Zhukov gave the 309th little credit for this success, stating that \\"The... 309th... operated poorly and without initiative\\". It was not chosen to become one of the first four Guards rifle divisions. As of September 12 the rifle regiments of the division averaged only 657 men each, indicating excessive casualties.David M. Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, Helion and Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2012, pp. 322-57 At the beginning of Operation Typhoon the 309th was still holding positions on the right flank of 24th Army, and by October 7 was deeply encircled north of Spas-Demensk.David Stahel, Operation Typhoon, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2013, map on p. 79 The divisional headquarters had disintegrated by that date and was disbanded, although it appears some elements fought on separately for another week or so.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 71  2nd Formation  A new rifle division, initially numbered the 449th,Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 100 began forming south of Krasnoyarsk on December 30, 1941,Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p. 116 under the command of Col.

The division spent about three months forming up in the Siberian Military District before moving west in April. In June it was assigned to the 6th Reserve Army, which became the 6th (active) Army on July 10, and joined Voronezh Front by the end of the month. The 309th remained in Voronezh Front, and its successor 1st Ukrainian Front, for the duration of the war. On November 10, Colonel Afanasev was promoted to Major General, but a week later was reassigned and replaced by Col. Pyotr Grigorevich Moskovsky. The 309th remained in 6th Army until the end of 1942, when it was reassigned to the 40th Army. On January 7, 1943, Maj. Gen. Mikhail Ivanovich Menshikov took command of the division. During the Soviet winter offensive of 1942 - 43 the 309th took part in the liberation of Belgorod on February 9, and the town of Bogodukhov on the 17th, but these gains were later lost during the Third Battle of Kharkov.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", pp. 116-17 During this counteroffensive 40th Army was forced back into what became the Kursk Salient, and in March General Menshikov was listed as missing in action.http://www.generals.dk/general/Menshikov/Mikhail_Ivanovich/Soviet_Union.html.

Battle of Kursk  In the lead-up to this battle, the 309th briefly became part of the 52nd Rifle Corps, still in 40th Army. That Army was in the front lines, somewhat to the west of the sectors where 4th Panzer Army would make its main attacks. By July 7, the third day of battle, the division was moved east to reinforce the 1st Guards Tank Army.

This was a spoiling attack intending to disrupt these divisions as they regrouped for their own attack towards the Psel. The attack made little headway, and the tanks of 11th Panzer soon threw the 309th back to its start line, but the overall objective of holding the Germans in place was achieved.Zamulin, pp. 427, 429, 434 That evening the German offensive was officially discontinued.  Battle of the Dniepr  In August the division was back in Gen. K.S. Moskalenko's 40th Army. During the next weeks the defeated German forces fell back through Ukraine as a race developed to reach the crossing points along the Dniepr River. Along this path, Colonel Dryomin was promoted to Major General on September 15, and three days later the 309th was credited with the liberation of the city of Piryatin, and was later given its name as an honorific: Two days following, the forward detachment of the division, backed by elements of 10th Tank Corps, reached the river near the town of Rzhyshchev.

On October 23 Stalin informed Gen. N.F. Vatutin of 1st Ukrainian Front that it was \\"impossible to take Kiev from the south. Now take a look at the Lyutizh bridgehead which is north of Kiev and held by 38th Army.\\" According to the new plan, 3rd Guards Tank Army and a rifle corps of 40th Army were secretly evacuated from Bukrin and moved to Lyutizh, as Moskalenko took command of 38th Army. On the morning of November 3, Soviet forces at Bukrin, which included the 309th, now in 27th Army, staged a diversionary attack while the forces at Lyutizh broke out of their bridgehead, and a day later Kiev was liberated.Erickson, in Stalin's Generals, pp. 144-45  Advance  In late January, 1944, the divisional returns of the 309th showed the following strengths: * 955th Rifle Regiment: 1187 officers and men with 518 rifles; 274 SMGs; 47 LMGs; 14 HMGs; 3 120mm, 13 82mm and 2 50mm mortars; 4 76mm howitzers; 5 45mm guns; 21 AT rifles * 957th Rifle Regiment: 1177 officers and men with 512 rifles; 149 SMGs; 22 LMGs; 8 HMGs; 5 120mm, 8 82mm and 1 50mm mortars; 2 76mm howitzers; 4 45mm guns; 12 AT rifles * 959th Rifle Regiment: 1253 officers and men with 537 rifles; 115 SMGs; 64 LMGs; 9 HMGs; 5 120mm, 16 82mm and 4 50mm mortars; 3 76mm howitzers; 6 45mm guns; 14 AT rifles * 842nd Artillery Regiment: 8 122mm and 3 (captured German) 105mm howitzers; 19 76mm cannon; 7 AT riflesSharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 117 The division briefly moved from 27th to 38th Army, then served from February until July 26 in 1st Guards Army.

The concept stems from descriptions found in canon law of medieval Europe. History During the later medieval period (10th to 15th centuries), a new scholastic way of thinking allowed the Church to solidify doctrine, leading to the formation of ecclesiastical law. This new wave of thinking stemmed from the revival and codification of some Roman laws. Particular works from Irneius and his students in 1112 and 1125 in particular, reconstructed some laws of Justinian's Code. Work on laws allowed scholars to debate the issues like marriage as a sacrament. Biblical references to marriage, like that found in 1 Corinthians 7 alludes to it as a preventative measure for \\"sexual immorality.\\" Scholars like Gratian of Bologna were quick to posit their theories on marriage. His 12th century work, Decretum Gratiani, became an early text example for other canon law studies and it is here where the earliest account for marital debt is found. In it, he writes that marriage arose from wishing to prevent further sin through fornication. Gratian is also quick to point out four main reasons people may have for getting married: that is for offspring, to pay the debt, or the obligation of sex, for incontinence, or to satisfy lust and for the sake of pleasure. A pattern of reciprocal sexual obligation then emerged. Spousal consent, from interpretations on marital debt, allowed spouses to more easily influence the lives of their other spouse. They lived in communal bond, a sexual bond known as a \\"conjugal domicile\\". One notable example of the strength of this bond, was when a husband wished to leave his marriage for a monastic life but he remains in a sexual debt to his wife. He, therefore, could only leave for the monastery if his wife consents to his departure. Impact Ecclesiastical courts were increasingly becoming a venue for couples to resolve marital disputes in the 11th and 12th centuries. It thus became important for the church to further consolidate and solidify canon law, so the courts could resolve the numerous cases. These increasingly strict canon laws made it much more difficult to get divorced or have a marriage annulled. One way to get a marriage annulment was if one spouse was impotent, in other words, if they could not fulfill the marital debt. In these cases, the healthy spouse could remarry while the impotent one could not. There was some disagreement amongst the clergy about cases where a person was capable of fulfilling the conjugal debt, but was sterile and could not procreate. In these cases, some thought that you needed to be able to procreate to maintain the marriage. Conjugal debt also had implications in terms of gender equality. For example, a woman had just as much right as a man to demand the debt. The conjugal debt \\"took precedence over most other duties.\\" Even in the case where a lord had called a man to rally. If his wife had insisted on the debt, \\"the wife's rights took precedence over the lord's.\\" A similar situation applied for crusading. If a man wanted to go on crusade he needed permission from his wife, because \\"his departure would deprive her of the sexual solace that he owed to her.\\"  See also  * Canonical impediment * Sacramental development References Marriage ","title":"Marital debt"},{"id":"48483573","text":"Li Peiyao (; 1 June 1933 – 2 February 1996) was a Chinese politician.

They are a deep brown color when moist, but become whitish when dry. The gills are initially brownish before becoming purplish-brown when the spores mature. The whitish, curved stipe measures long by thick, and is thicker at the top. It is initially stuffed with mycelia but later hollows. The wood substrate under the mushroom is held together by rhizomorphs at the base of the stipe. The cap and stipe bruise blue when touched, while the umbo typically becomes gray-bluish on its own. Frosts or rains often cause an intense bluing reaction. Spores measure 9–12 by 5.5–7.5 μm, and have a germ pore. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) are lageniform (flask-shaped), measuring 25–33 by 6.0–8.3 μm; pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are absent from the hymenium.

No alcoholic beverages or pork were served on board in accordance with Islamic dietary laws and prayers were recited before every flight. It was forced to cease operations after only five months due to management, safety and security issues, pilot strikes, and lack of funding. History Rayani Air was founded by Ravi Alagendrran and his wife Karthiyani Govindan, both Malaysians of ethnic Indian descent. The name Rayani is said to be combination of the first names of the founders. Rayani Airlines was originally intended to be based at Malacca International Airport, with its inaugural flight expected to take place in August 2014. However, the airline changed its base to Langkawi International Airport to attract tourists to the resort island. It was previously rumoured that Rayani Air would be launched as a low-cost carrier; however, the airline officially positioned itself as a full-service carrier in December 2015. On 20 December 2015, the airline's inaugural flight to Langkawi (RN600) took off smoothly. The airline was planning to co-operate with Royal Brunei Airlines to strengthen the Sharia-compliant airline concept within the aviation industry. On 9 April 2016, Rayani Air temporarily suspended all operations until further notice, citing 'restructuring exercises' in an announcement made by its co-founder. The Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom) announced in a statement on 13 June 2016 that Rayani Air's licence had been revoked, saying it had breached the conditions of its licence and lacked the financial and management capacity to continue operating as a commercial airline. Destinations * Kuala Lumpur (Main Hub) * Langkawi * Kota Bharu * Kuching * Kota Kinabalu Fleet Before ceasing operations, the airline's fleet consisted of two Boeing 737-400 aircraft, with the following on order: two more Boeing 737-400s, four Boeing 737-800s and two Boeing 777-200s. Accidents and incidents * On 9 February 2016, Rayani Air flight RN180 scheduled for Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 was cancelled due to a broken cockpit windshield. The next day, the airline issued a press statement apologising for the flight cancellation, and attributed the shattered windshield to a previous night flight. Rayani Air said they were investigating to see whether the broken windshield was an act of sabotage, and would liaise with relevant authorities to deal with this. * In March 2016, Rayani Air faced several issues and numerous complaints, highlighted in several media outlets. Passengers complained that the airline frequently rescheduled flights, often up to 13 hours later. The airline also frequently cancelled flights without advance notice and without compensation or assistance to affected passengers. It was reported that pilots refused to fly because of the poor condition of the aircraft. * Politician Lau Weng San criticised the airline for using handwritten boarding passes, posing a security threat to the aviation industry. This led the Minister of Transport, Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, to state that the airline would be investigated and suspended if necessary. On 11 April 2016, Rayani Air was officially suspended for 3 months. Its licence was permanently revoked two months later.

It was created by Sean D′mello and Artist Vineet Nair. It made a debut on the 35th anniversary issue of the comic book, issue number 639 released in November 2015. It is the first superhero from Mizoram. The name \\"Mapui\\" is a popular pet name among the Mizo people. The character originates from Aizawl, the capital city of Mizoram. She is the first female superhero from northeast India in the series of Tinkle. The editor Rajani Thindiath described it as a \\"reluctant superhero\\" but \\"has the potential to be the most iconic female superhero characters in Indian comic history.\\" She acquires super flight and super strength from gadgets developed by her inventor-father. Character Mapui is a 13-year-old girl from a middle-class family living in Aizawl. She is a naturally reluctant girl and preferring to play cricket than being a superhero. She is a regular school girl, but would try to avoid home works, and particularly averse to doing mathematics. She would rather go for sleepovers. Her father, Tashi Kawlim, is an inventor working for the Space Development Arm of the government. Her gadgets, including a secret superhero boost are developed by her father. She became a superhero after testing the gadget inventions of her father. Her gadgets are rocket thrusters that can make a speed of 110 km per hour, iron fists that can break brick walls, and reinforced robotic arms that can lift a ton of weight. Wearing a white and green suit, she fights criminals at night as her alias Wingstar. The signals of criminal activity are indicated by a special wristwatch, which allows her to receive notification at the same time as the police. Purpose The Tinkle has successful and regular characters such as Shikari Shambhu, Suppandi and Kalia the Crow. But they are becoming old-fashioned strips. It tries to include characters hanging innovative technology. Introduction of two female superheroes, SuperWeirdos and PsyMage, were not a success. The CatchNews reported that one of the objectives of introducing this superhero is to mend the feeling of prejudices among the people in northeast India. There are opinions in the mainland India that northeast India is more closely allied to China than to India. This has resulted in outcries of racial stereotyping and discrimination. The prejudices also turned to occasional violence, and northeasterners are the major victims. There are rape incidences of northeast Indian girls in other parts of India. In a comment, editor Rajni Thindiath added another objective, saying, \\"We need more iconic female heroes to join the plethora of enduring male comic characters in the country – Suppandi, Shikari Shambu and Tantri the Mantri.

His voice is preserved on several recordings made for the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts and on the television program Live from the Metropolitan Opera. Life and career Born in Bradford, Pennsylvania, Gilmore studied opera at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University where he earned both a Bachelor of Music and a Master of Music degrees. In 1980 he won the Regional finals of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. That same year he was a featured soloist in Arthur Honegger's Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher with Irene Papas and The Little Orchestra Society at Avery Fisher Hall. In 1982 he portrayed the title role in the United States premiere of Haydn's Orlando paladino with the Pennsylvania Opera Theater, and appeared as the Shepherd in Oedipus rex with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Seiji Ozawa at the Tanglewood Music Festival. In 1981 Gilmore made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Hunchback in Strauss' Die Frau ohne Schatten with Birgit Nilsson as The Dyer's Wife, Éva Marton as the Empress, and Gerd Brenneis as the Emperor. He appeared in nearly 200 more performances at the Met over the next eleven years, portraying such roles as Andres in Wozzeck, Archer in Francesca da Rimini, Count Elemer in Arabella, the Count of Lerma in Don Carlo, Eisslinger in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Malcolm in Macbeth, the Messenger in Aida, Normanno in Lucia di Lammermoor, Prince Shuisky in Boris Godunov, Ruiz in Il trovatore, Scaramuccio in Ariadne auf Naxos, the Shepherd in Oedipus rex, and the Steersman in The Flying Dutchman among others.

She has studied the dynamics of ancient imperial frontiers, and the ways in which Guarani tropical tribes expanded over these spaces. She has also conducted work in the eastern Bolivian valleys and Lake Titicaca region. Biography Sonia Alconini Mujica was born 1965 in Bolivia and developed an early interest in the political formations of early Andean societies and the use of archaeology to improve the understanding of cultural relationships. In 1992, she participated in the Taraco Archaeological Project of UC Berkeley at Chiripa, an ongoing project aimed at unraveling the socioeconomic and political development of the Formative Period of the Lake Titicaca basin. Pottery shards excavated at the site were from Chiripa, Chiripa-Mamani, and Tiwanaku III, IV, and V phases of civilization. She completed her undergraduate degree in 1993 from the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés in La Paz and went on to study at the University of Pittsburgh, earning a master's degree in anthropology in 2000 and a PhD in archaeology in 2002. In 2004, Alconini was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio and in 2010, she was promoted to an associate professor in the Department of Anthropology. Her early research focused on the spread of the Inka into the Bolivian highlands and their impact on the civilizations already in the area, showing interaction between cultures rather than domination. She won a US National Science Foundation grant in 2007 to further explore the boundaries of the Inka expansion and clarify changes before and after Inka contact. The aim of the project was to determine how contact with the Inka effected settlement patterns and the political economy of the area. In 2009, Alconini's excavations in the Charazani valley, the ancient imperial center of the Kallawayas, at a site called Pata Kaata yielded new insights into the evolution of the area, the range of activities which took place in its sacred sites, the process used to maintain political legitimacy and the hierarchy of the cultures at the borders of Lake Titicaca. In 2013, her collaboration with Sara Becker of the University of California at Riverside at the Wata Wata site, uncovered three skulls, two belonging to women. Examination showed ritual acts of violence, including beheading and removal of the eyes with no sign of battle injury. The discovery scuttled a long-held belief that images of violence were not literal depictions but were illustrative. Alconini's assessment of the evidence concluded that the inhabitants of Tiwanaku empire in the Kallawaya region of Bolivia, used trade, religion, and ritual violence as political strategies to retain power.

The packages, called snaps, and the tool for using them, snapd, work across a range of Linux distributions and allow upstream software developers to distribute their applications directly to users. Snaps are self-contained applications running in a sandbox with mediated access to the host system. Snap was originally released for cloud applications but was later ported to work for Internet of Things devices and desktop applications too. Functionality=Snap Store The Snap Store allows developers to publish their applications directly to users. With traditional Linux package management approaches like APT or YUM, the applications are packaged and distributed as part of the operating system. This creates a delay between application development and its deployment for end-users.Upgrading packaged Ubuntu application unreasonably involves upgrading entire OS Bug #578045 on bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu by John King (2010-05-10)Linus Torvalds on the problems of distro packaging Linus Torvalds on DebConf 2014 In contrast, application developers can publish their applications in the Snap Store and get them directly to users without any intervention from distribution maintainers. All apps uploaded to the Snap Store undergo automatic testing, including a malware scan. However, Snap apps do not receive the same level of verification as software in the regular Ubuntu archives. In one case in May 2018, two applications by the same developer were found to contain a cryptocurrency miner which ran in the background during application execution. When this issue was found, Canonical removed the applications from the Snap Store and transferred ownership of the Snaps to a trusted third-party which re-published the Snaps without the miner present. Although the Snap sandbox reduces the impact of a malicious app, Canonical recommends users only install Snaps from publishers trusted by the user. Because packages in the Snap Store are maintained by developers themselves, distribution maintainers cannot ensure packages meet quality standards and are timely updated. In one case, Microsoft left an outdated version of Skype in the Snapcraft store for over a year. Although the Snap Store by Canonical is currently the only existing store for snaps, Snap itself can be used without a store. Snap packages can be obtained from any source, including the website of a developer. Red Hat employee Adam Williamson and Linux Mint project lead Clement Lefebre have criticized Canonical for keeping some server side parts of the Snap Store closed-source. Clement states that this creates a conflict of interest which harms the neutrality of Snap given that Canonical develops Ubuntu. Universal Linux packages Snaps are self- contained packages that work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, which require specifically adapted packages for each Linux distribution. The snap file format is a single compressed filesystem using the SquashFS format with the extension \`.snap\`. This filesystem contains the application, libraries it depends on, and declarative metadata. This metadata is interpreted by snapd to set up an appropriately shaped secure sandbox for that application. After installation, the snap is mounted by the host operating system and decompressed on the fly when the files are used. Although this has the advantage that snaps use less disk space, it also means some large applications start slower. A significant difference between Snap and other universal Linux packaging formats such as Flatpak is that Snap supports any class of Linux application such as desktop applications, server tools, IoT apps and even system services such as the printer driver stack. As a result of this, Snap relies on systemd for features such as running socket-activated system services in a Snap. This causes Snap to only work on distributions that use this init system. Configurable sandbox Applications in a Snap run in a container with limited access to the host system. Using Interfaces, Users can give an application mediated access to additional features of the host such as recording audio, accessing USB devices and recording video. These interfaces mediate regular Linux API's so that applications can function in the sandbox without needing to be rewritten. Desktop applications can also use the XDG Desktop Portals, a standardized API originally created by the Flatpak project to give sandboxed desktop applications access to host resources. These portals often provide a better user experience compared to the native Linux API's because they prompt the user for permission to resources such as a webcam at the time the application uses them. The downside is that applications and toolkits need to be rewritten in order to use these newer API's. The Snap sandbox also supports sharing data and Unix sockets between Snaps. This is often used to share common libraries and application frameworks between Snaps to reduce the size of Snaps by avoiding duplication. The Snap sandbox heavily relies on the AppArmor Linux Security Module from the upstream Linux kernel. Because only one Linux Security Module (LSM) can be active at the same time, the Snap sandbox is much less secure when another LSM is enabled. As a result, on distributions such as Fedora which enable SELinux by default, the Snap sandbox is heavily degraded. Although Canonical is working with many other developers and companies to make it possible for multiple LSM's to run at the same time, this solution is still a long time away. The Snap sandbox prevents snapped desktop applications from accessing the themes of the host operating system to prevent compatibility issues. In order for Snaps to use a theme, it also needs to be packaged in a separate Snap. Many popular themes are packaged by the Snap developers but some themes are not supported yet and uncommon themes have to be installed manually. If a theme is not available as a Snap package, users have to resort to choosing the best matching theme available. Work is ongoing to make it easier for third parties to package themes in a Snap and to automatically install uncommon system themes. Automatic and atomic updates Multiple times a day, snapd checks for available updates of all Snaps and installs them in the background using atomic operation. Updates can be reverted and use delta encoding to reduce their download size. Publishers can release and update multiple versions of their software in parallel using channels. Each channel has a specific track and risk, which indicate the version and stability of the software released on that channel. When installing an application, Snap defaults to using the \`latest/stable\` channel, which will automatically update to new major releases of the software when they become available. Publishers can create additional channels to give users the possibility to stick to specific major releases of their software. For example, a \`2.0/stable\` channel would allow users to stick to the 2.0 version of the software and only get minor updates without the risk of backwards incompatible changes. When the publisher releases a new major version in a new channel, users can manually update to the next version when they choose. Although automatic updates cannot be turned off, there are many ways to configure updates to suit particular needs. User can choose to remain on a specific major version of the software by specifying the channel, they can configure the update interval to have time to manually check updates, and they can hold updates for up to 60 days. In addition, updates are also automatically disabled on metered connections. Even with these controls, a number of users have voiced their complaints about the lack of an option to turn automatic updates completely off. Snapcraft Snapcraft is a tool for developers to package their programs in the Snap format. It runs on any Linux distribution supported by Snap, macOS and Microsoft Windows. Snapcraft builds the packages in a Virtual Machine using Multipass, in order to ensure the result of a build is the same, regardless of which distribution or operating system it is built on. Snapcraft supports a great number of build tools and programming languages such as Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, C/C++ and Rust. It also allows importing application metadata from multiple sources such as AppStream, git, shell scripts and \`setup.py\` files. Adoption Snap initially only supported the all-Snap Ubuntu Core distribution but in June 2016, it was ported to a wide range of Linux distributions to become a format for universal Linux packages. Snap requires functionality (systemd), available in Linux, some other Unix-like systems do not have, so e.g. FreeBSD doesn't have Snap. Chrome OS doesn't support Snap directly, only through Linux distros installed in it that suppport Snap, such as Gallium OS. A number of Linux distributions support Snap out of the box such as Ubuntu (and e.g. Kubuntu), Manjaro, Zorin OS, KDE Neon, Solus and Li-f-e. Snap is also available for many other distributions such as Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Elementary OS, Fedora, GalliumOS, Kali Linux, Linux Mint, OpenEmbedded, Parrot Security OS, Pop!_OS, Raspbian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and openSUSE. A number of notable Desktop software development companies publish their software in the Snap Store, including Google, JetBrains, KDE, Microsoft (for Linux versions of e.g. .NET Core 3.1, Visual Studio Code, Skype, and PowerShell), Mozilla and Spotify. Snaps are also used in Internet-of-Things environments, ranging from consumer- facing products to enterprise device management gateways and satellite communication networks. Finally, Snap is also used by developers of server applications such as InfluxDB, Kata Containers, Nextcloud and Travis CI. In 2019, Canonical decided to switch the Chromium web browser in future Ubuntu releases from an APT package to a Snap. They explained that Snap made it much easier to support Chromium on all supported Ubuntu releases. This allowed them to focus engineering resources on other parts of the Ubuntu desktop. As a result of this decision, Ubuntu derivatives such as Linux Mint had to choose between maintaining their own version of the Chromium package or switching to the snapped version of Chromium maintained by Canonical. Clement Lefebre, Linux Mint founder and project leader, cited this as the reason why Linux Mint 20 blocks users from installing Snap. Since Snap is still available in the Linux Mint repositories, users can still install it after manually removing the restrictions. GNOME Software removed Snap support in July of 2019, due to code quality issues and lack of integration (specifically, that the user can't tell what Snap is doing after they click \\"install\\" and that it generally ignores GNOME's settings). This doesn't mean Snaps can't be installed in Fedora or other GNOME Software using distributions, only that Snap needs to be installed first. Ubuntu also used GNOME Software up to Ubuntu 20.04, and vice versa, there Flatpak support can be added.

In the north, it is connected to the mainland by a fairly narrow isthmus. Its western coast is separated from Fujian's mainland by the shallow Jiuzhen Bay; its eastern coast and southern coasts face the open sea (Taiwan Strait). Most of the peninsula is flat and sandy.

It is an independent public institution. Together with the Centre of Albanological Studies in Tirana, they represent the core scientific research centers on Albanology. History The institute was founded on 1 June 1953, in Pristina, in Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija of Yugoslavia. Initially, the staff consisted of four researchers (Ilhami Nimani, Selman Riza, Mehdi Bardhi, and Ali Rexha) and several external collaborators. The Yugoslav authorities terminated the project on 25 December 1955, since they failed to put its activities under censure. The UDBA secret services sequestered all materials. In the '60s, with the establishment of the University of Prishtina, the Albanological sciences in Kosovo restarted. The institute was reorganized on 28 February 1967, it had a staff of five people. During the first decade of its activities, the institute marked its results in all Albanological fields. A huge effort went into preparing new scientific researchers, and collecting materials on folklore, ethnology, linguistics, etc. A library was established and enriched with a vast number of published titles. With the increase in personnel number and research fields in 1977, the institute moved into its own newly constructed building. After 1981, with the denigration of the political autonomy of Kosovo, the institute was placed under censure and political control. At the same time, all cooperation with institutions and researchers from Albania was prohibited. Some major projects as Atlasi dialektologjik i të folmeve shqipe (Dialectical Atlas of the Albanian Speakings) and Leksikoni i shkrimtarëve shqiptarë (The lexicon of Albanian writers) remained unfinished. Its work continued even during the turmoils of the '90s. On 8 March 1994, the Serbian police enter the building and dragged the employees outside, beaten and covered in blood. Nevertheless, the work continued in private establishments, until 1 April 1998, when an Albanian-Serbian agreement was reached with some international intermediation, and the building was restored to the institute. As of 2015, the institute had 34 researchers and 15 administrative employees.Institute of Albanology - History Structure The institute is structured in branches and sections: #Linguistics branch: ##Dialectology section ##Lexicography section ##Language Culture section ##Onomastics section #Literature branch: ##General section #Folklore branch: ##Folkloric literature section ##Ethno-musicology section #History branch ##History section ##Archaeology section #Ethnology branch Publishing The periodicals consist of: *Gjurmime Albanologjike (Albanological Reconnaissance) bulletin with 3 series: **Philological Sciences, . **Folklore and Ethnology, . **History Sciences, .

Encapsulin nanocompartments are structurally similar to the HK97 bacteriophage and their function depends on the proteins loaded into the nanocompartment. The sphere is formed from 60 (for a 25 nm sphere) or 180 (for a 30 nm sphere) copies of a single protomer, termed encapsulin.

There are three main buildings that make up this area: the Large Theatre, the Odeon (small theatre), and the Quadriporticum. This served as an entertainment and meeting center of the city.[Saleri, Renato, Marc Pierrot-Deseilligny, Emmanuel Barbiere, Valeria Cappellini, Nicolas Nony, Livio De Luca, and Massimiliano Campi. \\"UAV Photogrammetry for Archaeological Survey: The Theaters Area of Pompeii.\\" 2013 Digital Heritage International Congress (DigitalHeritage). Vol. 2. Ieee, 2013. 497-502. Web. 5 Nov. 2015.] Pompeii had two stone theatres of its own nearly two decades before the first permanent stone theatre was erected in Rome in the 50s BCE. Most of the theatres were adapted for gladiatorial performances during the reign of the Roman empire. The Large Theatre The Large Theatre The Large Theatre was built into a natural hill in the second century BC. This theatre sat roughly 5,000 spectators and is one of the original permanent stone theatres to stand in Rome. In the Greek style, the tiered seating extends from the orchestra carved out of the hillside. The Roman influence is seen above this gallery where four tiers rested upon an arched corridor.[Monnier, Marc, 1827-1885. The Wonders of Pompeii. United States: n.p., 1870. Web. 6 Nov. 2015.] The cavae, audience seating area, was divided into three sections: the lowermost section, the ima, was reserved for senators, magistrates, and other noble people; the middle section, the media, sat the middle class; the top, the summa, was reserved for the plebeians. The tiers on the \\"ima\\" were wider and not as steep as the \\"media\\" or the \\"summa\\" to make it more spacious and comfortable for the higher class. The upper class was also separated from the other seating by a short wall, this was to show the class system, and the divide within the social standings of the classes in Rome. Following the earthquake of 62 CE, renovations were made to the theatre. The colonnade leading to the theatre was converted into barracks for gladiator residence.[Beard, Mary. Pompeii: The Life of a Roman Town. London: Profile, 2008;2010;2009;. Web. 6 Nov. 2015.] Modern usage The theatre has been used for concerts, operas, and theatre in modern times. In the 1950s, in an effort to preserve the original steps, iron frames were installed that allowed for wooden boards to be rested upon them to provide seating. In 2008, a restoration effort began to allow for further theatrical and musical performances. Upon reopening, productions of Puccini's La boheme and Bizet's Carmen took place in 2014.[Donati, Silvia. \\"Pompeii Hosts Opera Concerts.\\" ITALY Magazine. N.p., 17 Sept. 2014. Web. 06 Nov. 2015.] Odeon The Odeon The Odeon was a smaller roofed theatre, theatrum tectum, that sat 1500 spectators built in 80 BC. The theatre follows the plan of other Roman theatres and odeon structures. Where the Large Theatre was used primarily for staging drama, the Odeon was intended for a more educated audience, as well as a musical concert performance. Odeon plan The thin walls and rectangular plan lead to the conclusion that the roof would have been wood rather than vaulted stone. There are two raised tribunalia, platforms, above the seating that were reserved for important visitors. These platforms are cut off from the general seating completely with entrances from narrow staircases near the stage. The stage The stage featured five entrances on the back wall. A large palatial double door was center with two smaller double doors on either side. Two small single doors were located at either end. There is a large doorway that opens to a colonnade leading to the Large Theatre at the west end of the stage. Opposite this is a similar doorway opening up to the street. Behind the stage is a long dressing room or postscaenium. Following ancient theatre tradition, a machine used for suspending the gods and heroes was located at the left side of the stage.[Kelsey, Francis W. \\"The Stage Entrances of the Small Theatre at Pompeii.\\" American Journal of Archaeology 6.4 (1902): 387-97.

A revised edition was subsequently republished eight months later in trade paperback format under the title Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America during Trump's 2016 election campaign. Like his previous work Time to Get Tough (2011) did for the U.S. presidential election in 2012, Crippled America outlined Trump's political agenda as he ran in the 2016 election on a conservative platform. Trump makes his case for why he would be an effective leader of the United States, and reassures Republicans that he upholds conservative values. He criticizes the media's coverage of him while defending his decisions on the campaign trail. Crippled America stresses that the United States needs to start \\"winning again\\"; Trump asserts his business expertise can be translated into governmental success, that his \\"outsider\\" status can be utilized to negotiate agreements. On domestic policy issues, Trump recommends stricter border security and repealing the Affordable Care Act. As for foreign policy, he critically analyzes the impact of China on free trade. The book debuted at number five on The New York Times Best Seller list. NPR characterized Crippled America as typical of similar campaign-trail books, providing only a basic outline of the author's political agenda. A book review from On the Issues was positive, noting how Crippled America discredits assertions that Trump has no specific political stances. The New York Times reporter Michiko Kakutani criticized Trump for boasting about his business ventures while offering a dystopian view of the U.S. Regarding the book's writing style, CNN's Jeremy Diamond described Crippled America as being centered around \\"Trump's trademark simple prose, peppered with tangents\\".  Contents summary  In Crippled America, Donald Trump describes his views on the United States in the past 20 years leading to 2015; the author claims that career politicians, special interest groups, and lobbyists are culpable for the country's decline. Throughout the work, Trump criticizes President Barack Obama, as well as the media's portrayal of him—‌that journalists, particularly Megyn Kelly, have written unfavorably about him as a result of his unexpected rise in the polls. The author also describes the benefit of the media, noting how his outspoken personality and knack for hyperbole attributes to more publicity. Regarding how he has flip-flopped on political views in the past, Trump reassures Republicans he is an ideal conservative; \\"I switched years ago, when I began to see what liberal Democrats were doing to our country. Now I'm a conservative Republican with a big heart\\". Trump outlines his policies on domestic and foreign issues were he to lead the country. On U.S. domestic policy, Trump subdivides the book into chapters on immigration, health care, the economy, education, social programs, and energy. He supports reform that curtails illegal immigration to the U.S., delineating the American immigration system as a failure that has allowed violent criminals to enter the country. Trump proposes stronger security on the U.S. border with Mexico which would include the construction of a substantial border wall and cutting federal funds to sanctuary cities. An opponent of the Affordable Care Act, the author states he favors repealing and replacing the federal statute with a free- market healthcare system. The work discusses Trump's support for investing in American infrastructure to help stimulate economic growth. His plan, he argues, would create 13 million jobs and the largest economic boom since Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. With regards to the United States Department of Education, Trump makes a case to eliminate the department, have schools compete for students, and return educational policy-making to the state level. Trump describes himself as for social security, critical of costly alternative energy sources, and skeptical of man's impact on climate change. As for foreign policy issues, Trump discusses critically the impact of China on the U.S. The book refers to China as an \\"enemy\\" to American imports, further accusing the Chinese government of currency manipulation and corporate espionage. Trump recounts his financial standing with businesses in China, and believes the U.S. requires a firm leader to negotiate international trade deals. He concludes that, despite the complexity of the issue, the Chinese economy relies on trade with the U.S. as much as vice versa. Other significant subjects delved into within the book include Trump's analysis of the Syrian refugee crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the strategy for combating ISIL. Crippled America mixes Trump's political ideology with personal anecdotes. Trump reflects on his merits as a father as well as his faults as a husband; incidentally he blames himself for the failure of his two previous marriages. The book discusses his time gaining experience and life lessons under the tutelage of his father, Fred Trump. Crippled America includes an \\"About the author\\" chapter which provides an overview of Trump's financial assets and investments in real estate. Trump argues his accomplishments in business make him a model of success, that as a leader he would help the United States start \\"winning again\\". More discussion about Trump's transition to politics is provided: Trump asserts his outsider status on the political scene and experiences in the private sector would easily translate to governmental success; his expertise with negotiating global finance deals, he writes, can be utilized to broker diplomatic deals on the international scene.  Composition and publication  Crippled America served as a promotional mechanism displaying Trump's conservative views during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Prior to his work on Crippled America, Trump published two earlier political books, The America We Deserve (2000) and Time to Get Tough (2011): the former for the 2000 presidential campaign platform and the latter for the 2012 presidential campaign. The book demonstrated to Trump's opposition that he had legitimate political stances and sought to reassure Republicans that he was a staunch conservative. In addition to Trump, a ghostwriter contributed to writing Crippled America, hired by literary agent Scott Waxman who represented Trump in his contract with Simon & Schuster. The collaborative effort between Trump and the ghostwriter was a haphazard affair: \\"He (Donald) got this done on the road with a series of phone calls and snippets from campaign speeches\\", according to the New York Daily News. Trump said in 2015 about the book's gloomy title, that a cover photo shot inspired it: \\"there was one picture that was just mean. It was a horrible, horrible, mean picture. Like a nasty-looking guy. ... I said, 'We're going to call it, 'Crippled America.' Because that's what it is. It's 'Crippled America, he imparted. Trump held a press conference followed by a book signing at Trump Tower in New York City to promote the work. Crippled America was first published in 2015 in hardcover format by Simon & Schuster. An ebook format followed by an audiobook voiced by Jeremy Lowell were released the same year. During the 2016 presidential campaign, the book was reissued in trade paperback format under the title Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America with a new foreword. The book is also published in Danish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, and Vietnamese.  Sales and reception  Crippled America debuted at spot number 5 on the hardcover nonfiction section for The New York Times Best Seller list on November 12, 2015—‌one placement behind Republican candidate Ben Carson's book A More Perfect Union. In total, Trump's book spent 13 weeks on the Times' bestseller list. According to Nielsen BookScan, Crippled America outsold all other books published by 2016 political candidates, selling out of stock in the paperback version and an additional 199,000 hardcover copies by March 2016. Trump reported the same year he received between $1 million and $5 million in income from total sales of the book. NPR wrote that Crippled America \\"doesn't exactly break new ground,\\" and is comparable to other campaign-trail books which function \\"less [as] a literary work and more a political tool.\\" Chris Townsend of King's Review described the book with a direct quote from the work: \\"there's very little that is subtle or sophisticated about this book.\\" Townsend observed that the book, like Trump's earlier work The Art of the Deal (1987), portrays \\"Trump as the businessman who will get the best deal for America.\\" He further assessed Crippled America as \\"first and foremost, a business book,\\" translating the themes of his preceding books on a national scale. On the Issuess Jesse Gordon gave the book a favorable review, writing that Crippled America demonstrates to Trump's opposition his political stances; \\"Trump lays out specific policy choices,\\" Gordon attests, \\"in his own inimitable style, with real specifics and real substance, and he elaborates on how he came to the conclusions he did.\\" Michiko Kakutani, a reporter for The New York Times, criticized the book for boasting about the author's business ventures, while articulating a grim, dystopian view of the U.S. Kakutani adds \\"In many respects, Mr. Trump’s own quotes and writings provide the most vivid and alarming picture of his values, modus operandi and relentlessly dark outlook focused on revenge.\\" The Washington Times writer John R. Coyne highlighted Trump's blunt nature against \\"today’s carefully choreographed campaign kabuki.\\" Coyne points out the mutually beneficial relationship between Trump and the media, regarding the statements in Crippled America, that \\"They get reported and amplified. Mr. Trump benefits. And so does the media.\\" Jeremy Diamond of CNN noted that, much like the author's campaign speeches, the book is written in \\"Trump's trademark simple prose, peppered with tangents.\\" Although the content is familiar to those who followed his campaign, Diamond explained, it does \\"shed some light on Trump, the man, and how he plans to frame the future as he presses his bid for the Republican nomination.\\" See also * Bibliography of Donald Trump * Stronger Together, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign book * Our Revolution, Bernie Sanders' memoir published in November 2016 References 2015 non-fiction books American political books Books about conservatism Books about the 2016 United States presidential election Books by Donald Trump English-language books Simon & Schuster books ","title":"Crippled America"},{"id":"48483970","text":"Wingstar may refer to: * Wingstar (women's professional ice hockey team) former name (1998-2003) of the Montreal Axion * Wingstar (superhero) a fictional character created in 2015, from the Indian comic Tinkle, the superhero alterego of Mapui * Wingstar (dragon) a fictional character from The Immortals novel series by Tamora Pierce, see List of dragons in literature * Wingstar (video game), a 1996 videogame from Interactivision, see Index of DOS games (W) See also * Star (disambiguation) * Starwing (disambiguation) * Wing (disambiguation) ","title":"Wingstar"},{"id":"48483975","text":"SS Shahzada may refer to: * SS Shahzada, a British cargo ship, sunk in the Bay of Bengal on 14 July 1927 * SS Shahzada, a British freighter, sunk on 9 July 1944 by the , had assisted in picking up survivors of SS Samouri on 26 January 1944 Ship names ","title":"SS Shahzada"},{"id":"48483987","title":"Adam Cella"},{"id":"48484005","text":"HMS Flirt was launched in 1782 but was completed too late to see any significant service in the American War of Independence.

Daniel Bennett purchased her, had her almost rebuilt, and then employed her as a whaler in the Southern Whale Fishery. A French privateer captured her in 1803 as Flirt was returning to Britain from a whaling voyage. Royal Navy Commander Nathan Brunton commissioned Flirt for the North Sea in March 1782. She was then paid off in 1783, but recommissioned in April under Commander William Luke and stationed between Beachy Head and the Isle of Wight. She remained on that station through the tenure of her next two captains. Flirt was paid off in 1786 before Commander Piercy Brett recommissioned her in May. Commander John Stevens Hall replaced Brett in 1788, only to have Commander James Norman replace him in 1789. Norman recommissioned her in May 1790 for the Spanish Armament. George Bass, who would go on to achieve fame as an explorer, qualified as a surgeon for a first-rate (as a 13-year old), but his first appointment was to Flirt. Commander James Nicoll Morris recommissioned Flirt in May 1790 for the Channel. He sailed her for Jamaica on 22 November 1791. However, after she returned to Britain she was laid up at Deptford in November 1792. The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \\"Hull of His Majesty's Sloop Flirt.

She saw service throughout World War II. Background Following World War I, the Imperial Japanese Navy re-evaluated the use submarine warfare as an element of fleet strategy due to the successful deployment of long-range cruiser-submarines for commerce raiding by the major combatant navies. Japanese strategists came to realize possibilities for using the weapon for long range reconnaissance, and in a war of attrition against an enemy fleet approaching Japan.Peatty, pp. 212–14 Two large, long-range Japanese submarines had already been built under the Eight-six fleet program as prototype ( and ), however, the arrival on 20 June 1919 of seven German U-boats received by Japan as war reparations at the end of World War I led to a complete re-design. The Japanese quickly hired hundreds of German submarine engineers, technicians and former U-boat officers unemployed by the defeat of Germany in World War I, and brought them to Japan under 5-year contracts. The American ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) estimated that some 800 German advisors had gone to Japan by the end of 1920. The Japanese also sent delegations to Germany, and were active in purchasing many patents.Boyd, pp. 17–18 Design The four Kaidai Type 3a vessels were the first mass-produced Japanese fleet submarines. Based largely on the indigenous Kaidai Type II (I-52) a strengthened double hull, their design was also influenced by the largest of the German submarines in Japanese hands, the .Stille, p. 4 The hull had almost the same outer dimensions as the I-52, but the increased thickness of the inner hull permitted a diving depth of 60 meters. Internal volume was slightly increased by making the hull slightly trapezoidal in cross-section, at the expense of 300 tons of additional displacement. External differences included an anti-submarine net cutter on the bow, as well as an O-ring for towing purposes. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . The boats had a diving depth of and a complement of 60 officers and crewmen.Carpenter & Polmar, p. 93 Sulzer was retained as the manufacturer for the diesel engines, which had a slightly improved performance over the engines in the I-52. For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the KD3As had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at .Chesneau, p. 198 The boats were armed with eight internal torpedo tubes, six in the bow and two in the stern. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of 16 torpedoes. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface.Bagnasco, p. 183 Construction and career Built by the Kure Naval Arsenal, I-55 was laid down on 1 April 1924 as , and renamed I-55 on 1 November. The boat was launched on 2 September 1925 and completed on 5 September 1927. Pre-war I-55 was assigned to the Kure Naval District on commissiong. During a training exercise on 11 July 1929, she accidentally collided with her target, the heavy cruiser , and damaged her bow plating. On 10 February 1932, she was slightly damaged when she was accidentally rammed by her sister ship, . On 10 May 1936, she suffered minor damage to her bow plating in a collision with her sister ship . On 23 July 1936 she suffered more extensive damage when she was caught in a typhoon off Beppu, Kyushu, during naval maneuvers and ran aground in Terajima Channel, suffering severe damage to her hull plating. After her superstructure was partially dismantled, I-55 was refloated and towed to Kure on 31 July 1936, where she was drydocked for repairs.Hackett & Kingsepp By November 1941, I-55 and her sister ships I-53 and I-54 were assigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy's Submarine Division 18, a part of Submarine Squadron 4. and was based at Sanya, Hainan Island, China in December in preparation for the coming conflict in the Pacific. World War IIFirst war patrol= On 1 December 1941, I-55 departed Sanya to begin her first war patrol, and on 7 December she deployed north of Kuantan with I-53 and I-54 in a patrol line to support the Japanese invasion of Malaya, which was scheduled to begin the following day. Hostilities began in East Asia on 8 December 1941 (7 December across the International Date Line in Hawaii, where Japan began the war with its attack on Pearl Harbor), and on 9 and 10 December I-55 participated in attempts to intercept a British Royal Navy task force centered around the battleship and battlecruiser before they could threaten Japanese invasion convoys, although Imperial Japanese Navy torpedo planes sank the two ships off the Malayan Peninsula on 10 December before the submarines could engage them. On 14 December 1941, the Royal Netherlands Navy submarine reported sighting the periscope of a Japanese submarine and attempting to ram the submarine. The submarine probably was I-54 or I-55, neither of which suffered damage. I-55 ended her patrol at Cam Ranh in Japanese-occupied French Indochina on 20 December 1941. =Second war patrol= I-55 departed Cam Ranh on 29 December 1941 to begin her second war patrol. She patrolled the Bangka Strait off Sumatra without incident and returned to Cam Ranh on 14 January 1942. =Third war patrol= I-55 departed Cam Ranh for her third war patrol on 31 January 1942, assigned to patrol off the Anambas Islands. After refueling there on 2 February 1942, she proceed to the southern entrance to Lombok Strait. After the Japanese submarine Ro-34 expended all of her torpedoes in an attack on an Allied convoy, I-53, I-54, and I-55 received orders on 5 February to patrol Ro-34ʼs area. On 7 February, I-55 encountered the 4,519-gross register ton Dutch passenger ship Van Cloon in the Java Sea at and engaged her with gunfire, forcing her to beach herself on the south shore of Bawean Island in a sinking condition. The United States Navy patrol vessel arrived on the scene and rescued 187 people from Van Cloon, and opened fire on I-55 when I-55 attempted to surface nearby. I-55 dived and later was attacked by an Allied PBY Catalina flying boat. Japanese forces invaded Sumatra and Java on 8 February 1942, and on the evening of 13 February I-55 hit the British 4,799-gross register ton armed steamer Derrymore with two torpedoes. Derrymore, which was evacuating Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) personnel from Singapore to Batavia, sank 90 minutes later at with the loss of her entire cargo of ammunition and six crated Hawker Hurricane Mark II fighters, as well as nine RAAF personnel, although her entire crew of 36 and the other 209 RAAF personnel aboard were rescued. On 18 February 1942, I-55 reported sinking an Allied merchant ship with gunfire, although her likely target, the Norwegian tanker Madrono, was undamaged. I-55 ended her patrol with her arrival at Staring-baai on Celebes on 21 February 1942. At Kure Submarine Squadron 4 was disbanded on 10 March 1942, and I-55 was ordered back to Japanese home waters, and was reassigned to the Kure Guard Unit of the Kure Naval District. She departed Staring-baai on 16 March and arrived at Kure on 25 March 1942. Renumbered as on 20 May 1942, she operated from Kure, reassigned to Submarine Division 18 of the Kure Naval District on 1 April 1943 and to Submarine Division 33 of the Kure Submarine Squadron on 20 April 1943. I-155ʼs operations were uneventful until late May 1943, when the Imperial General Headquarters decided to evacuate Japanese forces from Kiska in the Aleutian Islands. Ordered to participate in the evacuation, I-155 departed Kure on 22 May, called at Yokosuka on 23 May, and then proceeded to Paramushiro in the Kurile Islands, being attached temporarily to the Kiska Evacuation Force on 29 May. She arrived at Paramushiro on 2 June 1943, and departed on 4 June carrying supplies for the forces in Kiska; however, she suffered damage in heavy seas and was forced to return to Paramushiro, where she arrived on 7 June. On 14 June she departed Paramushiro for repairs. I-155 arrived at Kure on 20 June 1943 and thereafter was employed as a training ship, assigned to the Kure Guard Unit on 28 July 1943 and to Submarine Division 18 of the Kure Submarine Squadron on 1 December 1943. On 5 January 1944, she tested a new submarine camouflage pattern in the Inland Sea for the Naval Submarine School, painted in a light gray scheme based on that of the German submarine , which Germany had transferred to the Imperial Japanese Navy as Ro-500. On 31 January 1944, I-155 was reassigned to Submarine Division 19 of the Kure Submarine Squadron and laid up without a crew. From 23 to 25 February 1944, she tested another camouflage scheme for the Naval Submarine School, painted bluish-gray and black. On 20 April 1945, I-155 was reassigned to Submarine Division 33, and by late in the month she had been converted to transport Kaiten submersible suicide craft to bases on Shikoku,. with her 120 mm gun replaced by two Kaiten. On 5 May 1945, she suffered damage while submerged in a collision with the hybrid oiler-seaplane carrier Hayasui off Kabuto-jima in the Inland Sea. On 20 July 1945, she was redesignated as a reserve ship and anchored near the Kure Submarine School. In the final days of the war, I-155 was selected for a Kaiten mission. Recommissioned in early August 1945, she was fitted with two Kaiten at Otsujima Naval Base and was scheduled to depart Hirao on 25 August 1945 with the submarine as part of the Shinshu-tai (\\"Land of Gods Unit\\") Kaiten group. However, Japan agreed to surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945, and the operation was cancelled and I-155 was recalled. Japan's formal surrender took place on 2 September 1945. Disposal I-155 surrendered to Allied forces at Kure in September 1945. She was stricken from the Navy list on 20 November 1945.

During a yellow fever epidemic in 1905, the Louisiana Naval Militia was activated during a series of quarantines enacted across the region. In one incident, two ships from Mississippi, Grace and Tipsy, attempted to cross into Louisiana from a quarantine zone. The Louisiana Naval Militia boarded the ships and arrested the officers and crew. The naval militia remained stationed on the Mississippi River to guard against possible incursions by Mississippi state troops crossing into Louisiana waters in their attempts to quarantine their own state from Louisiana fishermen; the naval militia remained on active duty until the federal government took over control of managing the quarantine response. In 1909, the Louisiana Naval Militia sailed on a training cruise. By 1913, the Louisiana Naval Militia consisted of two battalions of four divisions each, 461 members, and two ships: and USS Isla de Luzon.

Painting by Sergey Ivanov The Council of Uvetichi consisted of two meetings of the senior generation of princes of Kievan Rus'. It took place in August 1100, and it had a twofold purpose: to bring about a reconciliation among the princes and to pass judgment on Prince Davyd Igorevich. The venue of the conference was the town of Uvetichi, which is on the right bank of the Dnieper not far from Kiev. It is now the village of Vytachiv in the Kyiv Oblast. The Rus' Primary Chronicle (\\"The Tale of Bygone Years\\", the Povest' vremennykh let) is the primary source of information for the meetings, and the information is presented twice in the chronicle: first in detail under the year 1097, and then sequentially under the years 1098-1100.  Background  The council was preceded by severe conflict involving the Volhynian and Galician regions. It began in November 1097 when, violating the agreements reached at the earlier meeting of princes at the Council of Liubech, Volhynian Prince and Prince Svyatopolk II Izyaslavich of Kiev had captured and blinded Vasilko Rostislavich, prince of Terebovlia, whom Svyatopolk had tricked into coming to Kiev. The princes' reasons for convening included their suspicion of an alliance between Vasilko and Vladimir Vsevolodovich (Vladimir Monomakh) with the goal of installing Vladimir in Kiev and Vasilko in all the western regions, as well as Prince Davyd's concern for his own fate. Davyd had initiated a campaign to take possession of Vasilko's holdings, but was opposed by Vasilko's older brother Volodar, who besieged Davyd at Buzhsk and succeeded in securing the release of his brother. In the spring of the following year, 1098, Vasilko and Volodar besieged Davyd in the town of Vladimir. In the end they made peace, after the boyars responsible for the blinding of Vasilko were turned over to them for adjudication. In 1098 there was a meeting in Gorodets of Svyatopolk's cousins, Vladimir Monomakh, Davyd Svyatoslavich, and Oleg Svyatoslavich. Threatening military action, they demanded that Svyatopolk expel Davyd Igorevich. Then Svyatopolk deprived Davyd Igorevich of his throne in Vladimir, causing him to flee to Poland, and Svyatopolk installed his son Mstislav in Vladimir. Subsequently, Sviatopolk went to war with Vasilko and Volodar, asserting that according to dynastic law, the lands which they held belonged to him. Svyatopolk was defeated Rozhne Pole. King Coloman the Learned of Hungary joined the conflict on the side of Svyatopolk. The exiled Davyd Igorevich took the side of Vasilko and Volodar, and he brought in the Cumans and at the Vyagro River. Davyd then besieged Mstislav in Vladimir and captured the town. Svyatopolk's son was killed by an arrow during the siege on June 12, 1099. On August 5, the town of Vladimir was recaptured by Putyata, a Kievan military commander, but then David with the help of the Cumans once again took possession of Vladimir and Lutsk as well, driving out Svyatopolk's ally, Svyatoslav Davidovich.  The Council and Its Consequences  The first meeting took place on August 10, and Svyatopolk, Vladimir Monomakh, Davyd Svyatoslavich and Oleg \\"made peace among themselves.\\" When they met again on August 30, they summoned Davyd Igorevich. After listening to his explanation, the brothers pointedly moved away from him, leaving him by himself, and they would not allow him to speak. The kinsmen mounted their horses: Svyatopolk was with his military retinue and Davyd and Oleg each with their own retinues, but Davyd Igorevich remained on the sidelines since the others would not admit him to their presence while they discussed him. Once they made their decision, they sent messengers to him: Svyatopolk sent Putyata, Vladimir sent Orogost and Ratibor, and Davyd and Oleg sent Torchin. The Blinding of Vasylko. Miniature of Radzivil chronicle of the 15th century The envoys announced the kinsmen's decision: \\"We will not give you the throne at Vladimir because you raised a sword at us in a way never seen before in the Land of Rus'\\" He was deprived of Vladimir-Volhynsky, which was given to Svyatopolk's son Yaroslav. In exchange he received from Svyatopolk the towns of Buzhsky Ostrog, Duben, Czartorysk and wergeld of 400 grivnas from the other brothers, that is, 200 from Vladimir and 200 from the sons of Svyatoslav. Later Svyatopolk gave the town of Dorogobuzh to Davyd. As for Vasilko and Volodar, a decision was made to deprive Vasilko of his throne at Terebovl, apparently because a blinded prince was considered incapable of ruling. Envoys were sent to Volodar with orders that either he was to take care of his blind brother personally, or else send his brother to Kiev, where the princes promised to take care of him. Vasilko and Volodar did not accept these orders. The conditions under which the peace was concluded are not known, but Vasilko did remain Prince of Terebovl until his death. A short time later Svyatopolk came into conflict with Prince Yaroslav Yaropolkovich, his nephew by the older brother of his who had been killed by Vasilko and Volodar in 1086. In the end Yaroslav died in a Kiev prison.  Notes  # The Russian Primary Chronicle, entries under the years 1097-1100.  Literature  * Cross, Samuel Hazzard and Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor.

Early life and education Lebedeva was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1881; her father, a cook, died in 1892, leaving the family dependent on charity. Despite this, Lebedeva graduated from the gymnasium and earned a gold medal, then took a job as a schoolteacher in a rural area. By 1901, she was financially stable enough to attend the Women's Medical Institute in St. Petersburg, but was expelled twice due to her political activities. She eloped to Finland with the Bolshevik, Pavel Lebedev- Polianskii, and then fled to Geneva in the interim, but graduated from the Institute in 1910. Career Though she was fired from her first job as a district physician in Russia for political activity, Lebedeva soon returned to Geneva, where her political views were more accepted. Beginning in 1912, she was an obstetrician/gynecologist in Geneva. In 1917 she became a Bolshevik and came back to the nascent Soviet Union for good. Her first position in the new country was as the director of the Central Institute for Protection of Motherhood and Infancy; she chaired that institute from 1918 to 1930. (footnote 23) There, she instituted the world's first public health program aimed at reducing infant mortality. The innovative program consisted of a network of nurseries and preschools, each staffed with a qualified pediatrician who could monitor the children's health and advise parents. The program was very successful. She also supported legalized abortion as a positive policy that supported women in the workforce. Lebedeva also worked to procure donations from the Rockefeller Foundation for Soviet relief campaigns. In 1924, she attended a congress of the Medical Women's International Association. During this time she also ran the American Medical Women's Association's medical relief efforts in the Caucasus region. Lebedeva's career in public health grew as she was charged with researching disabilities (from 1931–1934), and then as a state public health inspector, from 1934–1938. For the next 12 years, she directed Moscow's Central Institute of Advanced Training for Physicians. Honors Lebedeva was awarded the Order of the Red Flag of Labor and the Order of Lenin, the latter three times.

Background Following World War I, the Imperial Japanese Navy re-evaluated the use submarine warfare as an element of fleet strategy due to the successful deployment of long-range cruiser-submarines for commerce raiding by the major combatant navies. Japanese strategists came to realize possibilities for using the weapon for long range reconnaissance, and in a war of attrition against an enemy fleet approaching Japan.Peatty, pp. 212–14 Two large, long-range Japanese submarines had already been built under the Eight- six fleet program as prototype ( and ), however, the arrival on 20 June 1919 of seven German U-boats received by Japan as war reparations at the end of World War I led to a complete re-design. The Japanese quickly hired hundreds of German submarine engineers, technicians and former U-boat officers unemployed by the defeat of Germany in World War I, and brought them to Japan under 5-year contracts. The American ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) estimated that some 800 German advisors had gone to Japan by the end of 1920. The Japanese also sent delegations to Germany, and were active in purchasing many patents.Boyd, pp. 17–18 Design The four Kaidai Type 3a vessels were the first mass-produced Japanese fleet submarines. Based largely on the indigenous Kaidai Type II (I-52) a strengthened double hull, their design was also influenced by the largest of the German submarines in Japanese hands, the .Stille, p. 4 The hull had almost the same outer dimensions as the I-52, but the increased thickness of the inner hull permitted a diving depth of 60 meters. Internal volume was slightly increased by making the hull slightly trapezoidal in cross-section, at the expense of 300 tons of additional displacement. External differences included an anti-submarine net cutter on the bow, as well as an O-ring for towing purposes. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . The boats had a diving depth of and a complement of 60 officers and crewmen.Carpenter & Polmar, p. 93 Sulzer was retained as the manufacturer for the diesel engines, which had a slightly improved performance over the engines in the I-52. For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the KD3As had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at .Chesneau, p. 198 The boats were armed with eight internal torpedo tubes, six in the bow and two in the stern. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of 16 torpedoes. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface.Bagnasco, p. 183 Construction and career Built by the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, I-54 was laid down as , on 15 November 1924, but was redesignated as I-54 before the end of the year. The boat was launched on 15 March 1926 and completed on 15 December 1927. Service history=Pre-war I-54 was assigned to the Kure Naval District on commissioning. On 15 March 1932, she suffered from a steering failure was slightly damaged when she accidentally rammed her sister ship, off the Goto islands, damaging her bow and flooding a compartment. After repairs, she was placed on reserve status until November 1934. She was again assigned to the reserves from 1 November 1937 to March 1938, and from 19 June 1941 to August 1941.Hackett & Kingsepp In late November 1941, I-54 was assigned to Submarine Division 18, which also included and , was a part of Submarine Squadron 4, and was based at Sanya, Hainan Island, China in December in preparation for the coming conflict in the Pacific. World War IIFirst war patrol= Just before the attack on Pearl Harbor, I-54 began a patrol north of Kuantan to support \\"Operation E\\", the Japanese invasion of Malaya. Hostilities began in East Asia on 8 December 1941. On 14 December 1941, the Dutch submarine K.XII unsuccessfully attempted to ram either I-54 or I-55 west of the Anambas islands. =Second war patrol= From 20 December, I-54 was based at Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina. I-54 was then reassigned to patrols of the Sunda Strait in support of the Japanese invasion of the Netherlands East Indies through early-March 1942. She sank two unidentified merchant vessels south of Java on 20 February and unsuccessfully attacked an Allied tanker on 24 February. She sank another unidentified merchant vessels on 25 February, and one more on 3 March. She refueled at Staring-baai in the Celebes on 8 March 1942 and was ordered back to Japanese home waters on 16 March. =At Kure= At Kure, her designation was changed to on 20 May 1942 and she was assigned to training duties thereafter due to obsolescence. In December 1943, I-154 was repainted in a new experimental camouflage paint scheme, and participated in tests in the Seto Inland Sea in January 1944 to determine the effectiveness of the paint from both surface warships and from the air: however, the experiment was a failure. From 31 January 1944, I-154 was transferred to the reserves, and docked without a crew at Kure. She was removed from the navy list on 20 November 1945. After the surrender of Japan, I-154 was seized by Allied forces and was scuttled in the Seto Inland Sea in May 1946.

History Valaichchenai paper mill was established in 1955 with a total investment of about 32 million rupees and it was commissioned for commercial operation in 1956. In 1958 it was renamed as Eastern Paper Mills Corporation. At that time this paper mill was considered as the biggest factory in the Eastern province, especially in the Batticaloa district. The period of 1970s the mill had around 3,000 employees. In 1976 it became state-owned and then run as a state venture. With the expansion programme, carried out by the funds generated from the Valaichchennai, a second paper mill was established at Embilipitiya in 1976. These two State corporations satisfied 70% of the total paper demand of the country. The name of the Eastern Paper Mills Corporation was subsequently changed to the National Paper Corporation (NPL). With the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War during the 1990s in the Eastern province, then government implemented new changes in the market policies with regard to the import of paper. That directly caused industrial difficulties for the Paper Corporation and also resulted in the lowering of production levels at the paper mill drastically in the latter part of the 1990s. It was then largely converted into a waste paper recycling centre with a newly established network of collecting sub-centres. With the time going, production operations at the paper mill were disrupted gradually with the reasons of bad financial situation and lack of experienced staff. Present After the defeat of LTTE, then government recommenced the operations of the Valaichchenai paper mill again, but which is now on a very low profile.

In 1927, she became the first Japanese woman to receive a doctoral degree in science. She received a Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon and was awarded as an Order of the Precious Crown Third Class for her academic accomplishments and leadership in women’s education in Japan. Early Life and Education Yasui was born in the town of Sanbonmatsu in Kagawa Prefecture in 1880, to the owner of a shipping business. She was the first child of nine siblings and was raised by parents who valued and emphasized education. When she was moving from lower elementary to higher elementary school, her father persuaded her to read Encouragement of Learning, a highly influential book written by the philosopher and educator Yukichi Fukuzawa. Throughout her early education, she excelled in her studies, and was particularly gifted in science and mathematics.Yamazaki, Miwae. \\"Where no Other Dared to Go: Kono Yasui 1880-1971 Japan's First Woman Doctor of Science.\\" Blazing a Path: Japanese Women's Contributions to Modern Science (2001): 7. Print. She graduated from Kagawa Prefecture Normal School in 1898 and the Division of Science at the Women's Higher Normal School in 1902. She taught at Gifu Girls' Higher School and Kanda Girls' School until 1905, when a graduate course was established at the Women's Higher Normal School. She was the first woman to enter the course with a major in science research; she focused on zoology and botany. She published a paper about the Weberian apparatus of carp fish in Zoological Science in 1905, becoming the first woman published in the journal. Her research on the aquatic fern Salvinia natans was published in the Journal of Plant Sciences and the British journal Annals of Botany, marking the first publication of a Japanese woman's research in a foreign journal.Kono Yasui, On The Life-history of Salvinia natans, Annals of Botany, Volume os-25, Issue 2, April 1911, Pages 469–484, https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a089337 She completed the graduate program at Women's Higher Normal School in 1907 and became an assistant professor at the school.  Academic career  When Yasui applied to the Japanese Ministry of Education to study abroad, they were hesitant to give her permission because of their belief that “a woman cannot achieve much in science.” She was only allowed on the condition that she listed \\"home economics research\\" alongside \\"scientific research\\" on her application and that she agreed not to marry and instead commit herself to her research. She traveled to Germany and the United States in 1914 to perform cytological research at the University of Chicago. She travelled to Harvard University in 1915, where she conducted research on coal under Professor E. C. Jeffrey. She returned to Japan in June 1916 and continued researching coal at Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo) until 1927. She taught genetics there from 1918 to 1939, and was made a professor at the Women's Higher Normal School in Tokyo in 1919. She completed her doctoral thesis, \\"Studies on the structure of lignite, brown coal, and bituminous coal in Japan\\", in 1927, becoming the first woman in Japan to complete a doctorate in science. In 1929, Yasui founded the cytology journal Cytologia. From 1924 onwards, she researched the genetics of poppies, corn and Tradescantia species, and in 1945 she began a survey of plants that had been affected by nuclear fallout after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When Ochanomizu University was established under its current name in 1949, Yasui was appointed professor. She retired in 1952, becoming a professor emerita. By 1957 she had published a total of 99 scientific papers.  Legacy  Kono Yasui accomplished a lot of firsts during her life and career as a biologist and cytologist. Her career lasted from the late Meiji period, through the Taisho (1912-1926), to the early Showa period (1926-1989). During this time, women were strongly oppressed in Japan and were all but outlawed from working in research and academia. She was the first Japanese woman to publish an academic paper in an international journal. Most notably, she was the first Japanese woman to receive a doctoral degree in science, and she did so at a university that did not accept female students until almost 20 years later.\\"History of Todai Women.\\" Office for Gender Equality, The University of Tokyo. 28 March 2019 2019.

During her time as a teacher at Tokyo Women’s Higher Normal School, she was very strict and did not treat her students as “girls.” Outside of the laboratory and classroom, however, she was known to be kind to her juniors and students alike. She heavily valued and contributed to the advancement of women’s education in Japan. After World War II, Yasui worked to establish a national university for women. These efforts were successful, as she played a pivotal role in the transformation of Tokyo Women’s Higher Normal School to Ochanomizu University in 1949. She also donated the money received as gifts for her retirement to the Tokyo Women’s Higher Normal School as the “Yasui-Kuroda Scholarship,” which continues to provide educational opportunities for young female researchers today. Kono Yasui’s life has served as a guide and shining example to a whole generation of young women scientists.

Freeman, 92 U.S. 275 (1876), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the powers to set rules surrounding immigration and to manage foreign relations rested with the US government, rather than the states.. The case has been cited in other Supreme Court cases related to government authority on matters relating to immigration policy and immigration enforcement, most recently in Arizona v. United States (2012)..  Background  Immigration from China to the Western United States, particularly California, had picked up in the mid-19th century during the California Gold Rush. There was hostility to Chinese immigration from many California natives, particularly among labor unions representing white laborers. The government of California passed a number of laws to make the state unwelcoming to Chinese immigration, including the Anti-Coolie Act of 1862. The US federal government, on the other hand, was pursuing a more friendly approach to the Chinese government. In 1868, the US and Chinese governments agreed to the Burlingame Treaty in which China was granted most favored nation status for trade, and both countries would freely permit immigration of the citizens of the other country but without any promise of a path to citizenship. Indeed, the Naturalization Act of 1870 explicitly restricted naturalization to blacks and whites, but citizenship at birth was still open to all, as would subsequently be affirmed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1878). In 1875, the California passed a statute authorizing the immigration commissioner to inspect passengers arriving in California at a cost of 75 cents per inspection, which was levied on the passenger, and giving him the authority to deny entry to passengers suspected of being lewd and debauched. Those suspected could thus be allowed entry if the captain of the ship paid a bond for them.  Similar statutes and associated court cases  Two other United States states, New York and Louisiana, had similar statutes that were challenged around the same time. * Henderson v. Mayor of City of New York, 92 U.S. 259 (1875): A lawsuit by the owners of the steamship Ethiopia from Great Britain, which had arrived at New York City, challenged statutes of New York and Louisiana that required the owner of a ship to post a bond for landing immigrants to cover indemnities if they proved to need state assistance. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and argued that the power to set immigration policy rested with the federal government and set a requirement of a bond constituted a sufficient policy with significant impact on international movement as to be the exclusive domain of the federal government.. * Commissioners of Immigration v. North German Lloyd  Facts  There were 22 women from China, including Chy Lung, among the passengers on the steamer Japan that journeyed from China to San Francisco, arriving in 1875. The immigration commissioner examined the passengers and identified Chy Lung and the other women as \\"lewd and debauched women.\\" The captain of the ship had the option of paying a $500 bond per woman to allow her to land for the ostensible purpose to \\"indemnify all the counties, towns, and cities of California against liability for her support or maintenance for two years.\\" The captain, however, refused to pay the bond and detained the women on board. They sued out a writ of habeas corpus, which led to them being moved into the custody of the Sheriff of the County and City of San Francisco, where they stayed, awaiting deportation upon the return of Japan, which had already left for China. The women refused to be deported to China and appealed the decision to deport them. The California High Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute used to deny them entry and upheld their deportation. They appealed the decision in the US Supreme Court. It was the first case to appear before the US Supreme Court to involve a Chinese litigant.  Supreme Court decision  Justice Stephen Johnson Field ordered the release of all the women from the Sheriff's custody. However, Chy Lung still pressed the case in the Supreme Court and sought to test the constitutionality of the statute that had been used to imprison her and her companions. On October 1, 1875, the Supreme Court decided unanimously in favor of Chy Lung. Its primary argument was that the federal government, rather than the states, was in charge of immigration policy and diplomatic relations with other nations and so it was not up to California to impose restrictions on Chinese immigration. The Supreme Court also noted that thise action by the government of California could jeopardize foreign relations for the US government by running afoul of treaty obligations., pp. 269-271 The Supreme Court noted that states could make reasonable and necessary regulations concerning paupers and convicted criminals, but the regulation went far beyond that and was extortionary. The court was also critical of the California, the Commissioner of Immigration, and the Sheriff of San Francisco for not presenting any arguments on their behalf in the case. The court was also critical of the lack of due process governing the immigration commissioner's decisions to mark particular immigrants as lewd and debauched.  Page Act  Around the time that the case was decided, the US government passed its first official policy significantly restricting immigration, along lines similar to the California statute that had been deemed unconstitutional. The Page Act of 1875 prohibited the entry of immigrants considered \\"undesirable,\\" a category that was intended to include forced laborers and female prostitutes and applied to people of Chinese citizenship and descent. The bar on female prostitutes was the most heavily enforced aspect of the Act. The implementation mechanics involved prescreening of Chinese women in Hong Kong to ascertain their good moral character and certify that they were not prostitutes. That was very different from the operation of the California statute, which involved inspection by the immigration commissioner after the ship had landed. In subsequent years, with the Angell Treaty of 1880 and Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), the US government would significantly restrict Chinese immigration. Later decisions on cases litigated by Chinese litigants challenging US immigration enforcement tended to be decided against the litigants and in favor of the federal government (the most important of them, also known as the Chinese Exclusion Case, was Chae Chan Ping v. United States). However, insofar as the decisions deferred to the federal government's authority, they were consistent with in Chy Lung v. Freeman.  Significance  Judge Denny Chin, a circuit court judge in the United States who is famous for sentencing Bernie Madoff, arranged for the enactment of a courtroom drama about the case. He considered the case historic because it was the first by a Chinese litigant and one in which the court ruled in favor of the litigant at a time when sentiment against Chinese and immigration was rising, with the Page Act coming into force. The case has also been cited in arguments made by legal counsel as well as in opinions given by judges in subsequent Supreme Court decisions. Most recently, in Arizona v. United States (2012), the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional some sections of Arizona's SB 1070, a law to devote state law enforcement resources to enforce some aspects of federal immigration law. The Supreme Court cited Chy Lung v. Freeman as a precedent.  See also  * Good moral character * Moral turpitude * Chae Chan Ping v. United States * Arizona v.

The CVMA also publishes information about pet care for the public.http://www.canadianveterinarians.net/uploads/userfiles/images/cvma_jerkytreats_e_web.pnghttps://www.canadianveterinarians.net/communication- material Veterinary students in Canada are automatically members of the CVMA and are referred to as Students of the CVMA (SCVMA) (', ÉACMV). Each of Canada's five veterinary schools has a student representative who sits on the CVMA's Student committee. Veterinary students can attend an annual symposium in veterinary medicine including lectures and labs. Students can also apply for CVMA scholarships.http://www.canadian- universities.net/Scholarships/C/Canadian-Veterinary-Medical-Association- Award.htmlhttp://www.canadian-universities.net/Scholarships/C/Canadian- Veterinary-Medical-Association-Prize.html While veterinary schools in Canada are accredited by the Council on Education of the American Veterinary Medical Association, licensing exams for Canadian veterinary students are administered by the National Examination Board of the CVMA.  Position statements  As part of CVMA's leadership on veterinary issues, they publish official position statements of national and international veterinary interest intended to serve as guidelines for veterinarians across the country as well as educate the public on the veterinary profession's opinion on various topics. The CVMA has 13 general position statements and 36 animal welfare position statements. Vaccination A recent increase in preventable infectious disease in pets has been seen in conjunction with a decrease in vaccinations. The CVMA supports vaccination of animals as preventative medicine to reduce disease risk. Despite this stance, there has been some controversy that veterinarians may be over-vaccinating pets; in response to this criticism, the CVMA maintains that research on longevity of vaccine coverage remains controversial, and vaccination schedules should be developed on an individual basis, depending on exposure risk. On the issue of the northward migration of the West Nile virus, according to the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association - BC chapter's Dr. John Twidale, chair of the equine committee, stated that though the West Nile virus has been in British Columbia for five years, 2014 saw the first two cases of West Nile virus in two horses in Cache Creek and Ashcroft, and warned horse owners to get their animals vaccinated.  Cosmetic body alterations  The January 2014 position statement reads: Provincial veterinary associations had been addressing ear cropping and tail docking with various levels of bylaws or codes of practice banning veterinarians from these procedures. Vets are banned from cropping ears in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and BC, which in November 2015, citing the position statement of the CVMA also decided to ban ear-cropping in dogs. Following the 2014 CVMA statement, veterinary associations in three provinces have banned vets from performing any cosmetic surgeries: Québec (by the '), Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, while the government of Prince Edward Island has passed an Animal Welfare Act also banning all cosmetic surgeries. (Newfoundland was the earliest to ban these surgeries in 1978). The CVMA also provides specific position statements for sheep, horses, horses, and cattle.  Mental health of veterinarians The CVMA Task Force on Member Wellness (2010) showed 19% of Canadian veterinarians had seriously contemplated suicide, confirming conclusions of a 2010 British study which found that the suicide rate among veterinarians is four times that of the general population and twice that of other healthcare professions.  Work with public health concerns  With increasing global concern over development of aantimicrobial resistance, the CVMA has taken an active role in Canada on the responsible use of antimicrobials. The CVMA has urged the government for further regulatory changes to provide increased veterinary oversight of antibiotic use in Canada. In 2015, the CVMA revised their statement to include a position on use of antimicrobials of high importance in human medicine (VDD Category I to III), stating they should only be used under veterinary oversight with a veterinary prescription. The CVMA, in conjunction with Health Canada and other partner organizations, developed a Therapeutic Decision Cascade for Animal and Public Safety. This document is intended to assist veterinarians in prescribing drugs, including antimicrobials, in a conscientious way for both animals and public health. In 2014, the CMVA released their Antimicrobial Smartvet App that guides veterinarians through prescribing appropriate antimicrobials for specific bacterial infections in dogs and cats. In Canada two major concerns of ticks are Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). With global warming ticks are found further north and according to the CMVA, pet owners should increase their awareness of ticks on their pets as the prevalence of diseases carried by ticks is on the increase. As the ticks often migrate via birds, pet owners must start their pet maintenance routines in early spring, as soon as the weather passes zero Celsius.

The Mongols laid a siege in the spring of 1238 and eventually conquered and destroyed the town of Kozelsk, one of the subsidiary princely centers of the Principality of Chernigov.  Background  Taking the city of Torzhok on 5 March 1238 after a two-week siege, the Mongols continued to Novgorod. However, they failed to reach the city, mainly because they had difficulties moving in the woods, and after advancing around 100 kilometers at the unknown place designated in the chronicles as the Ignach Cross, they abandoned the plans to conquer Novgorod, turned south, and divided into two groups. Some of the forces led by Kadan and Storms passed over the Eastern route through the Ryazan land. The main forces led by Batu Khan passed through Dolgomost 30 km east of Smolensk, then entered the Chernigov Principality on the upper Gums, burned Vshchizh, but then abruptly turned to the northeast, bypassing the Bryansk and Karachev, at the end of March 1238 went to the Kozelsk on the Zhizdra River. At that time the city was the capital of the Principality at the head of twelve-year-old Prince Vasily, grandson of Mstislav Svyatoslavich of Chernigov, who was killed at the Battle of Kalka in 1223. The city was well fortified: surrounded by ramparts built on them walls, but the Mongols had powerful siege equipment.  Reasons for the long siege  The duration of the siege, according to various versions, could be affected by several factors in different combinations, including: * The overall decline in the fighting capacity of the Mongol army after the first phase of the campaign. * The slush made impassable valleys of the rivers Zhizdra and into it Kozelsk Druguse and locked the Mongol army on the watershed. * The slush turned the city into an island fortress. * Kozelsk was appointed a place of gathering troops.

He was a very controversial Romanian interim Education Minister in the cabinet of Victor Ponta.Nature.comGov.ro.en Fsli.roMmuncii.roAgerpres.ro He played an important role during the Victor Ponta doctoral thesis plagiarism controversy (then the Prime Minister) scandal. A session of a committee charged with validating academic titles analyzed the Victor Ponta doctoral thesis and decided with a unanimous vote of members present that Ponta had committed copy and paste plagiarism, subsequently requesting the withdrawal of Ponta's doctoral title. In response, interim Education Minister Liviu Pop (PSD) contested the committee's jurisdiction and dismissed the findings, citing the lack of a quorum. The minister had already signed an order reorganizing the committee the previous day, but, due to technical reasons, the order came into effect during the very session analyzing the thesis. Another committee, subordinated to the Education Ministry, later found that Ponta did not commit plagiarism. On July 27, 2016 the CNATDCU (Consiliul Naţional de Atestare a Titlurilor, Diplomelor si Certificatelor Universitare) (reformed by the new Education Ministry) has reconfirmed the plagiarism verdict, subsequently requesting the withdrawal of Ponta's doctoral title. He is also known for making very embarrassing grammar, spelling and logical mistakes, for example misspelling the word \\"knee\\" in Romanian (\\"genunche\\" instead of \\"genunchi\\"), or that \\"mistakes can be fixed, while errors cannot\\" („greşelile se pot corecta, erorile nu”), or that \\"12th grade students have been in school for 17-18 years\\" (\\"[...] Vă place cum arăta şcoala, când aţi intrat acum 18 ani sau 17 ani?

It was built in 1878. It is also known as Metropolitan Hotel (1878-1935). It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Hotel Francis is a two-storey building, constructed in multiple stages between 1878 and 1938. It is on the site of an earlier hotel, the Maryborough Inn, later known as the Steam Packet. Settlement at Maryborough commenced in September 1847 when George Furber established a woolstore on the south bank of the Mary River at the head of navigation. He was followed in June 1848 by ET Aldridge and Henry and RE Palmer, who established their own wharves on the opposite riverbank, at a location now known as the original Maryborough town site at Baddow. In 1850 a new town site was surveyed to the east, at a downstream position which provided better access for shipping. The first sale of land at this new site occurred in 1852, but most residents did not shift to the current centre of Maryborough until 1855 and 1856. Maryborough was gazetted a Port of Entry in 1859 and was proclaimed a municipality, the Borough of Maryborough, in 1861. During the 1860s and 1870s Maryborough flourished as the principal port for the nearby Gympie goldfield and as an outlet for timber and sugar. The establishment of manufacturing plants and primary industries sustained growth in the town into the twentieth century. The Maryborough Inn, believed to be the first hotel at the new town, was established on the site as early as 1853. The first licensee was James Davenport Walker. The site was subsequently occupied by the Steam-packet Hotel which was demolished to make way for the first stage of the present building. The first storey of the present building, then known as the Metropolitan Hotel, was erected in 1878. Described as a one-storey building with four sitting rooms and five bedrooms exclusive of those used by the publican, it had an frontage to Kent Street and a frontage to Richmond Street. Access was provided to the upper floors of the adjoining Helsham's Buildings for extra accommodation. On 1 May 1883, tenders were advertised for additions to the hotel. This was probably for the first storey of the rear extension facing Richmond Street. Further tenders were called in 1914 for additions and an extension to the bar; the architect being HWF Palmer. The hotel remained a single- storey building and was now described as having seven rooms for the public and three for private use. On 17 April 1919, the Maryborough Chronicle reported that plans had been prepared for a second storey. A photograph indicates this was completed by 1923. The photograph also shows, by this time, the Kent Street frontage was very similar in appearance to the present building but the rear, Richmond Street, extension (now two storeys) comprised only a single storey. The hotel was given its present name, the Hotel Francis, in 1935 while in the ownership of the Noonan family. In 1938 tenders were let for a second-storey addition to staff quarters facing Richmond Street. The architect was POE Hawkes. Surrender of the hotel licence was accepted by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Racing in September 1992.  Description  The former Hotel Francis is a two-storeyed masonry building located on the corner of Kent and Richmond Streets, Maryborough. The site contains several smaller buildings to the rear of the hotel. The hotel comprises two major elements; the early hotel lined with two-storeyed verandahs extending down the Kent Street facade and around the corner into Richmond Street where it is met by the second stage of the building, a two-storeyed stuccoed wing. The early section is constructed of rendered brick which has been scribed to resemble stonework to the height of the parapet, which consists of a face brickwork band surmounted by a stringcourse with dentils above which is an Italianate balustrade punctuated with moulded masonry panels. Centrally located on Kent Street facade of the parapet, interrupting the balustrade is a face brick curved pediment, accentuating the ground floor entrance to the former accommodation and dining rooms. The parapet conceals a hipped corrugated iron roof. The two-storeyed verandah is supported on posts, the cast iron body of which sits on a timber base and is also extended through the frieze in timber. The truncated corner of the building is emphasised by pairs of columns flanking the corner entrance, extending through to the floor above. The ground floor verandah frieze is of plain timber slats with feature fretwork slats, below which are diagonally cut timber panels. One bay of the ground floor verandah space has been infilled with rendered and scribed brickwork. The verandah to the upper floor has an ogee curved profile awning, balustrading of similar detail to the frieze below, and slatted timber brackets and frieze. A rudimentary rear verandah is accessed by a straight timber stair. Entrance to the former public bar is through the double glazed doors, with arctic glass transom window above, on the truncated corner. The Kent Street facade has several half glazed and moulded french doors with operable transom windows above and a centrally located double doorway, of four panelled doors, as well as large window openings with moulded sills and consoles. The joinery to this elevation is very fine and intact. Internally the building features pressed metal ceilings, cornices and roses throughout and timber floors. The upper floor retains some single skin timber partitioning, though the original layout is evident in the pressed metal ceiling where different patterns were used for each room. The later rendered masonry extension, in Richmond Street, features round arched openings to the ground floor and square arched openings above, which are shaded by a hipped awning of fibrous cement. The flat parapet of this section has \\"HOTEL FRANCIS\\" in relief, concealing a skillion roof. To the rear of the hotel is a small one storeyed brick building with a hipped corrugated iron roof and a large brick chimney stack at one end.  Heritage listing  Hotel Francis was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Hotel Francis demonstrates the growth of Maryborough. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Hotel Francis is a good and intact example of a Queensland country town hotel, and is an important element of the Kent Street streetscape.

The group was led by Sulayman ibn Surad Khuzai, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The army of Tawwabin fought against Umayyad army in the Battle of 'Ayn al- Warda in January 685. They were defeated and their leaders were killed.  Background and formation of the Tawwabin  After the accession of the second Umayyad caliph, Yazid, the Kufans invited Husyan ibn Ali to lead a revolt against him. While on his way to Kufa, Husayn was killed in the Battle of Karbala by the government forces, and the support of Kufan Shia did not materialize. Kufans were regretful and blamed themselves for not having done anything to help Husayn. Following these emotions, an organized movement was started by a group of Kufan Shia, who called themselves Tawwabin (the penitents). The uprising started under the leadership of five followers of Husayn's father Ali ibn Abi Talib, and initially comprised one hundred Kufans, all aged sixty years or more. They held their first meeting in the house of Sulayman ibn Surad Khuzai, a companion of Muhammad, in 61 AH (680/81 CE), in which Sulayman was elected as the leader of the uprising. The movement remained secret until 64 AH (683/84 CE). After the death of Yazid and the start of the Second Fitna, the Iraqis drove out the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad and Iraq came under Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr's influence. The collapse of Umayyad authority eased conditions for the Tawwabin and they publicly started calling for support to their cause. The movement had no further goals apart from fighting the Umayyads and atoning for their failure to support Husayn. Their slogan was \\"Ya Latharat al-Husayn\\" (). Some 16,000 people enlisted in the register of Sulayman. They secretly gathered soldiers and weapons from Kufa and the tribes around it. Sulayman secured support of Shia leaders in Basra and al-Mada'in by sending letters.  Start of the uprising  In Rabi' al-thani of 65 AH (November/December 684 CE), Sulayman summoned his men that had joined his army to Nukhayla. Out of 16,000 people that had promised to show up, only 4000 were present. One of the reasons was that Mukhtar al-Thaqafi believed that Sulayman had no experience of wars, so many Shia, especially those from Mada'in and Basra, from Khuzai's army began to abandon him in large numbers. Finally, 1000 more left the army. The army spent three days in Nukhayla, and then went to Karbala to mourn at the grave of Husayn.  Battle of Ayn al-Warda  After visiting Karbala, the army arrived at Qarqisia. The Tawwabin pressed on to Ayn al-Warda (identified with Ra's al-Ayn), where they met a Umayyad army of 20,000, under command of Husayn ibn Numayr. The battle started on 4 January 685 and lasted for three days. Although the Tawwabin held the upper hand in a first skirmish, over the next two days the numerical superiority of the Umayyad army began to prevail. Finally, Sulayman was killed and the Tawwabin were almost annihilated. Rifa bin Shaddad advised the survivors to return and brought them to Qarqisiya. The small number of Tawwabin who survived the battle, went over to Mukhtar al- Thaqafi. These Kufans, who formed the backbone of Mukhtar's movement, called themselves Shia al-Mahdi, Shia al-Haqq or Shia al-Muhammad. In his book, The origins and early development of Shia Islam, Seyed Husain Mohammad Jafari argues that the Tawwabin were apparently defeated, but in fact they formed the first ever integrated Shia organization, which was influenced by Husayn's thinking, in order to serve the Shia community.

It was designed by Charles Tiffin and built from 1864 to 1883 by William Hope. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  The Government Bond Store in Maryborough, one of the earliest brick buildings in the town, was constructed in several stages from 1863. The building served for many years as a store for goods being processed by the adjacent Customs House. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established there in 1847-8 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where the settlement was emerging but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. With the separation of Queensland from the colony of New South Wales in 1859, Maryborough was declared a Port of Entry and a sub collector was appointed. As a port the conditions of importing and exporting from Maryborough were subject to the control of the Queensland Customs Department. Taxation on goods entering and leaving the colony was an important source of revenue for the newly established Queensland Government and, accordingly, customs services were highly regarded and respected. Collectors and sub-collectors were appointed as towns along the coastline were declared Ports of Entry, and although most customs officers commenced their duties in humble or makeshift buildings, the importance of the service demanded customs houses of more prominence and grandeur. Brinsley Sheridan, the sub-collector appointed to Maryborough, worked from a customs office established in what became the kitchen of an early Maryborough hotel, later known as the Criterion. In 1861 a purpose built customs house was constructed with funds granted by the government. Tenders were called for the building in early 1861 and the building was ready for occupation in March 1862. The site chosen was adjacent to the wharf area. The buildings erected at this time included a brick customs house facing the river and a timber residence adjoining the rear of the main building. As trade increased through the Port of Maryborough, the Government made provision for to be spent on the construction of a Government Bond Store in which to store goods held on the Customs House site. The contract was let in 1864 to a William Hope and a simple rectangular single storeyed brick building was constructed to the south east of the first Customs House. The design of this section of the current Bond Store has been attributed to Queensland's first Colonial Architect, Charles Tiffin. Through the 1860s and 1870s Maryborough grew rapidly, in response to the discovery of Gold in Gympie to which Maryborough served as port and with the introduction of the railway. The first rail systems were privately owned and linked the wharves with surrounding businesses. In 1881 the North Coast railway line was extended from Maryborough to Gympie. Trade increased and extensions, costing were planned to the Bond Store in 1870. A storey was added to the building and a two storeyed wing extended the building to Wharf Street where an entrance was created. When extended the Bond Store was transformed from a simple rectangular planned building to an L-shaped plan. Further additions, costing were made by 1883 when another two storeyed wing was added between the original 1863 wing and Wharf Street, transforming the L-shaped plan to a rectangular planned building. As well a gauging store was constructed for a cost of by local contractor Henry Neale around the lower floor level of the rear walls of the Bond Store. In 1901 the Customs Service was transferred to Federal government management and therefore the Customs House and ancillary buildings, including the Bond Store were transferred to federal ownership. Although the building has altered very little since the last major additions were made in 1883, its function as a bond store was lost when the Port of Maryborough was relocated to Urangan at Hervey Bay and customs services became redundant in Maryborough. The building has since been converted to a museum, interpreting the history of the former Port of Maryborough within the Portside Centre heritage precinct.  Description  The former Government Bond Store is a two storeyed masonry building, with upper principal level aligned with Wharf Street and a partially subterranean basement level. The building is located within the Customs House reserve. The building has a rectangular plan, principal entrances to the upper storey from Wharf Street, and a corrugated iron double hipped roof, which may have the remnants of an early roof lantern. The two entrances from Wharf Street are emphasised by projecting gabled roof section surmounting brick projections with round arched openings to the doorways. The two entrances are slightly different in detail and size, reflecting the development of the building. The former Bond Store is of brick and stone construction; the external walls are face brick and the foundations of the building are rock faced stone. The principal facade of the building, off Wharf Street, is dominated by the two entrances, which are separated and also flanked by segmental arched window openings. Internally the building has two principal rooms on the upper level, one of which has a timber boarded ceiling, rendered walls and timber boarded floor. The other room, on the south eastern side of the building, has ceilings open to the various sections of roof framing, a timber boarded floor and painted and bagged brickwork walls. In the eastern corner of the former bond store is a straight open tread timber stair leading downwards to the basement level. Access is also provided to this lower level from Macalister Street through large double timber boarded and braced doors. This level has unpainted rubble stone walls forming several smaller spaces, with large arched openings connecting them. The floor is earth and several timber frames, presumable used as storage bases, line the floor.

It was built from to . It is also known as Blairholme and Lambert Hyne House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Ilfracombe was constructed in the early 1890s as the residence of Andrew Wilson's sister-in-law, Margaret Blair and her family, adjacent to Wilson's own residence, Doon Villa. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-8 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 surveyor Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary ... to suggest ...t he best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other ... also ... point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. During the 1860s an 1870s, Maryborough flourished as the principal port of Gympie where gold was discovered in 1867. Andrew Heron Wilson arrived in Maryborough in about 1866 and established the Maryborough Sawmills, where he worked for many years before joining in partnership R Hart and J Bartholemew, and constructing a larger sawmill for Wilson, Hart and Co., as the partnership was known, in 1881. He retired from milling after only two years at his new mill. Wilson was a large investor in Gympie gold mining and was a director of the Monkland South Glanmire Company and also of the Maryborough Building Society. He was a member of the Queensland Legislative Council from 19 September 1883 until his death on 29 August 1906. In about 1882 Wilson acquired the property on which he constructed his residence, a large timber house, known as Doon Villa overlooking the Mary River. This was an impressive house and an early history of Maryborough considers it one of the residential jewels of Maryborough, and indeed of Queensland. Wilson planned an impressive garden around the house. He constructed a bowling green for use by a lawn bowls club at his home, the oldest in Queensland. In 1889 Wilson and his wife went on an extended holiday, first to England and then to New Zealand, where they visited Mrs Wilson's sister, Margaret Blair and her children. Margaret Blair's husband, Robert, died on 18 February 1893 and his wife and children left New Zealand and went to live with the Wilsons at Doon Villa in Maryborough. Wilson is thought to have managed the construction of a new house, called Blairholme, for his wife's sister and her four children. Wilson purchased the land, being section 2 on Allotment 147, adjacent to Doon Villa's Sections 3 and 4, on which Blairholme was built in 1891 and the house is thought to have been built sometime after Mrs Blair's arrival in 1893. Wilson's involvement with the timber and iron industries in Maryborough may explain the absence of tender notices for the construction of the house, which has made identification of an architect difficult. It is suggested that the architect of Blairholme was from Rockhampton. By 1895 the house was completed and the Blair family were in residence. The death of Andrew Wilson on 29 August 1906 resulted in his land being transferred to Queensland Trustees Limited as a condition of his will, although it appears that the Blair family remained in the house until 1935 when the allotments were subdivided and sold. Hugh Keys bought the property on which Blairholme stood and, two years later, on 8 March 1937, this property was transferred to James Richard Lambert Hyne, a member of another prominent local timber milling family company. The Hyne family were descendant from Richard Matthews Hyne who arrived in Maryborough and established himself as the publican of the Royal Hotel in about 1873. Hyne realised that Maryborough was an emerging municipality as the port of the flourishing Wide Bay-Burnett region and Gympie goldfields. He became interested in establishing institutions in the town and helped improved health, education, welfare and recreational facilities in the area. Hyne was mayor of Maryborough for a year in 1878. The Hyne family have a long interest in the local timber milling industry and their family company continues to this day. The Hyne family had a family home in Lennox Street called Ilfracombe and when they bought Blairholme the name was transferred from this earlier residence. On the death of his father the property was transferred to Warren Henry Hyne who retains the house. In 2012 ownership was transferred to Rod and Sue Grieves who are now reside there with their family. The building has been altered over its life with rear sections removed and replaced. Internally, many changes have been made including extending the kitchen area both into the space of the verandah and into an extension of the house.  Description  Ilfracombe is a large one-storeyed timber constructed overlooking, to the east, a reach of the Mary River. Access to the house is via a laneway from the northern end of Lennox Street, with the building concealed from the street. Surrounding the house is a large garden which includes several established trees and plantings. The house is a timber framed building clad with horizontal timber weatherboards. The corrugated iron roof of the building, which incorporates an attic, is quite complex, reflecting the complexity of the internal planning. The roof scape comprises a number of asymmetrically arranged and variously sized gabled and hipped sections, with a steeply pitched mansard roof over the attic, which is surmounted with a decorative cast iron balustrade, with projecting finials from the corners. Surmounting the gabled ends are similar cast iron finials. The house is lined on three sides by bull-nosed verandahs although some of these have been infilled. Generally the building has high quality joinery and craftsmanship; several projecting bay windows are filled with etched and coloured glass panels and the external joinery is of fine quality. Internally the building generally has timber boarded floors, walls and ceilings. Occasionally the size or orientation of timber boarding varies indicating that much of the house may have been papered or otherwise lined internally when constructed. The interior is arranged around a central vestibule from which hallways lead to the principal entrance to the south and to the kitchen on the west. Many original features remain intact, including a fine anaglypta lined vaulted ceiling in the drawing room; internal doors and other joinery; a fine fireplace with painted tiles, despite many internal alterations.

Instead, he ended up at Francis Delafield Hospital, which had just opened as a cancer center. Though Holland was initially hoping that another slot would open up at Presbyterian, he found that he preferred to remain at a specialty cancer institution. Career In 1953, while Holland was a researcher at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), he designed a clinical trial for the treatment of acute leukemia. The study examined the combined use of two chemotherapy drugs, methotrexate and mercaptopurine. The trial was still in progress the next year when Holland moved to the Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI). When the NCI's new chief of oncology, Gordon Zubrod, agreed to continue the trial, it became the first multicenter study of acute leukemia. Holland conducted further leukemia research with physicians from the NCI and the Children's Hospital of Buffalo. That research group received government funding for the study of chemotherapy. It became known as Acute Leukemia Group B (and later Cancer and Leukemia Group B). Holland became a close associate of oncologist Emil \\"Tom\\" Frei. From the 1950s to the 1980s, either Holland or Frei chaired the CALGB. Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine became an influential oncology reference book; nine editions have been published. Holland, Frei and Emil Freireich later created another drug regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. The combination of methotrexate, mercaptopurine, vincristine and prednisone – together known as the POMP regimen – produced sustained remission in these patients. After leaving RPCI, Holland spent several months conducting cancer research in the Soviet Union. He joined the faculty at Mount Sinai in 1973. Oncologist Vincent DeVita has referred to Holland as \\"one of the founding fathers of cancer chemotherapy.\\" DeVita said that Holland's work proved that combination chemotherapy had the potential to cure cancer. According to DeVita, Holland's influence ensured that childhood leukemia research received ongoing attention. Though acute leukemia had been considered incurable upon the formation of the CALGB, the ten-year cure rate for ALL had reached 50% by 1975. Holland served as the president of two national cancer research organizations: the American Association for Cancer Research (1970–71) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1976–78). He received the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research in 1972.  Personal life  While he worked at RPCI, Holland met his wife, Jimmie C. Holland; she became a psychiatrist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Holland had a daughter, Diane Louise, with his first wife, Fern Lucille Rahe, whom he married at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in June 1945. Their marriage came to an end in a divorce. He met his second wife, and they had five more children together, Steven M., Sally, Peter, Mary and David. One of Holland's siblings, Thomas R. Holland (1926–2013), was the first oncologist in Morristown. His elder brother, Albert H. Holland Jr. (d. 1988), was the medical director of the FDA from 1954 to 1959. Holland's son Steven is the NIH Deputy Director for Intramural Clinical Research. Death He died at the age of 92 on March 22, 2018, at his home in Scarsdale, New York, from complications of cardiovascular disease.

From the 16th century onwards the palace housed a growing collection of books - many of them theological - and also a collection of fine art paintings. The library and pictures were dispersed in the mid-nineteenth century, when ownership of the palace passed to the Russian tsarist government. The building was stripped of its baroque architectural features and used as a military barracks and hospital. It currently houses a high school named for Adam Mickiewicz. Description The present form of the palace is a reconstructed barracks, carried out after 1854. The earlier reconstructions have been obliterated. Today it is a large, three-storey building on a rectangular plan with prominent projections at the ends of the façade. The interior layout is two-bay, partly changed during the subsequent reconstructions and repairs. The interior décor has not survived. In the basement the vaults are preserved, with lunettes and barrel vaulting. The northern façade looking over the courtyard has thirteen bays, separated by pilasters with Ionic capitals (finials). The middle window (slightly wider than the others) on the first floor of the façade is a remnant of the eighteenth century main entrance door, approached by flights of stone steps. The south elevation - formerly overlooking the formal garden has fifteen bays with pilasters, but with Tuscan capitals. The ground floor is rusticated, creating a base for the building. There have been no archaeological excavations, and little is known about the former buildings which used to form a courtyard around the palace. Only an outbuilding to the south-east survives, which was turned into a hospital. It was one of Four buildings built in the eighteenth century to form a surrounding courtyard. On the foundations of outbuildings to the south-west one of the hospital buildings rises. There are no traces left of the northern outbuildings - the north-western one was demolished in 1996, the north-eastern much earlier. To the west of the palace a few old buildings the farm remain; and the granary from the late eighteenth century was converted into a cinema. A field hospital, built in the second half of the nineteenth century by the tsarist army and located south of the palace, was demolished in 2001. Also preserved is an eighteenth-century statue of St. John of Nepomuk, now in the hospital; it probably originally stood on a circular island in the ornamental pond on the north side of the palace. History Designs for the palace c1770, before it was heavily altered c1850 Słupecki family A medieval castle with a moat formerly stood on the site, which was further surrounded by ponds including a fish pond on the eastern side. Sięgniew Słupczy was the owner of Opole in 1368. Opole was granted civic rights at the end of the fourteenth century, perhaps coinciding with the construction of the castle. The exact date is not known - documents were burned in the fifteenth century. King Casimir IV of Poland renewed the privilege in the years 1450 and 1478. The influence of the Słupecki family increased through the sixteenth century, and Stanislaw Słupecki, Castellan of Lublin, began collecting fine art paintings, and a large library. Work on the reconstruction of the medieval mansion into the modern Opole palace began not long after 1600, when Felix Słupecki (c1571-1616), Castellan of Lublin, and Barbara Leszczynski—the sister of Rafal Leszczynski of Baranow Sandomierski—were married in the Baranowski mansion. The building was finished by 1613 - the date is testified on a ceiling beam rediscovered during the renovation in the 1930s. The beam is now located in the old bell tower at the parish church in Opole. There are no other surviving remains of the old medieval building. It is possible that reconstruction was carried out by Santi Gucci from the court of Jan III Sobieski, who designed of reconstructions of castles in Janowiec and Baranow, both associated with related with Firleja and Słupecki families and Rafal Leszczynski. Jan Tarło Hugo de Groot, defender of the principle of international waters Felix Słupecki was a Calvinist, unlike the majority of Poles who were Catholic (see Religion in Poland) although, and members of his family studied in Nuremberg, Heidelberg, Strasbourg, Basel and Leiden, rather than, for example, the University of Padua favoured by other Poles. The Słupeckis maintained lively contacts with Western European thinkers and hosted many of them in Opole. From the sources it is known among others that Felix Słupecki corresponded with the Dutch Protestant jurist Hugo de Groot (Grotius) who, as an Arminian, was involved on the other side of the Calvinist–Arminian debate. Słupecki's extensive library contained a number of theological works, and he founded a Reformed Church school in Opole Lubelskie in 1598, with as its first head. George Słupecki, the last male descendant of the family, died in 1664. Opole passed into the hands of the Anglo-Irish-German pl:Butler family, the Dunin-Borkowski, and then Tarłó families by about 1690. The palace was rebuilt in the Baroque style in the years 1737-1743 for Jan Tarło, the voivode of Lublin Voivodeship, under the direction of Tylman of Gameren, the architect of the court in Puławy. The contract committed him to \\"transform the old palace in Opole and new pavilions at the corners, with stonemasons.\\" Jan Tarło brought the Order of Piarists to Opole in 1743, a still-existing educational Catholic order. The Piarists opened the first vocational school of craft in Poland in 1761 in Opole, based on modern principles of teaching. Many books from the house were given to the seminary when the great library was dispersed in the 19th century. The Piarists were ejected from Opole after the January Uprising in 1863. Jan Tarłó's widow, Sophia Krasinski Lubomirska, created a park around the palace and continued to enlarge the library and art collection. Lubomirski family Alexander Lubomirski in 1785-1787 designed by Franciszek Degen The house was acquired in 1754 by Prince Antoni Lubomirski, and remodelled between 1766 and 1773 by (among others) Domenico Merlini and the royal architect, Jacob Fontana. The palace was inherited in 1782 by his nephew Prince Alexander Lubomirski, who wanted to create a cultural residential park similar to the Czartoryski palace in Puławy (the 'Polish Athens') a few miles away. Alexander Lubomirski also built a Palladian villa for entertaining guests in Niezdowie, about 1 km west of the palace, in 1785-1787. Rozalia Lubomirska, executed in Paris in 1794 He married Rozalia Czartoryski, and they had a daughter Princess Alexandra Francis Lubomirska. Rozalia was in Paris (with Alexandra, aged 7) during the Reign of Terror. She was arrested several times in Paris on espionage charges and was guillotined in 1794 aged 23. Alexandra was freed from the same prison where she had been held with her late mother, and returned to Opole. However, Polish discontent after the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 led to the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794. The Russians quelled the uprising, and after the Third Partition of Poland, Poland ceased to exist as a country for 123 years.Peter Hagget. \\"Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 24\\" Marshall Cavendish, 2001. . p 1740 The nearby palace in Puławy belonging to Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski was plundered utterly and burnt by the Russians for his part in the uprising. The remainder of the Polish nobility in the Russian-ruled parts of Poland who supported the uprising were stripped of their possessions and estates, which were in turn awarded to Russian generals and favourites of the St Petersburg court. Alexandra's tutor in Opole around 1800 was Jean Vesque de Puttelange, an exiled former government official from the Habsburg Netherlands; his son Johann Vesque von Püttlingen (the composer 'J. van Hoven') was born in the palace. In 1804 she and her father moved to Habsburg-ruled Vienna where she married the orientalist, Count \\"Emir\\" Wacław Seweryn Rzewuski. 19th century military use Adam Mickiewicz In 1847, Alexandra Rzewuska sold the Niezdowie grand villa to a judge, Kazimierz Wydrychiewicz.Died 1869. Photo of gravestone in Opole. In 1854 she disposed of (or sold) the house and its contents to the Russian general Ivan Paskyévich, the Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland since 1831. Many of the books in the library were donated to the Piarist seminary in Opole; after the Order was suppressed after the January Uprising, some of the collection ended up in the Hieronim Łopaciński public library in Lublin. Field Marshal Ivan Paskevich After 1854 the Lubomirski palace was converted into a Russian military barracks, undergoing a severe redesign which included the loss of the mansard roof and the removal of the balustrades and tympanums; the third storey was heightened. The outbuildings were turned into a hospital, the last being demolished c2001. The former interior décor no longer survives. Further rebuilding took place in the 1940s and 1960s. The Lubomirski palace is currently used as a high school named after the national poet of Poland, Adam Mickiewicz. References ;Notes ;Citations Further reading * Gawarecki, Henryk.

However, the main part of the volcanic activity was concentrated between 8.5 and 7 million years ago. Thereafter, the original volcano was largely eroded, massive landslides occurred, and it was further eroded by glaciers and water. Geomorphology Relief map of the Mounts of Cantal. The stratovolcano of Cantal is the widest in Europe. It is roughly circular with a diameter between . Its highest point is the Plomb du Cantal (), located in the eastern part of the massif. Around 20 valleys have been formed in the range, radiating out from the centre and cutting the basaltic plateau into triangular pieces called planèzes. These valleys were occupied by glaciers during the last ice age, which explains their U-shape. Topography=Main summits The mounts of the Cantal are composed of several summits, the best known being: * Puy Mary (), which offers a beautiful panorama from its summit; * Plomb du Cantal (), accessible from the ski resort of Super Lioran and from the pass of Prat-de-Bouc; * Puy Griou (); * Puy Chavaroche (); * Puy de Peyre- Arse (), offering a magnificent panorama of the glacial valleys of Santoire and Impradine; * Puy de Seycheuse (), which offers a panorama of the glacial cirque of Santoire and the valley of Alagnon.

Tirth Pat is different than the conventional map making and is not drawn to scale. Tirth Pat is not indicative of distances, elevation, topography and direction and is solely used for evocation of Jain pilgrimages (Tirthas). It is believed in Jainism that mere viewing of a Tirth Pat earns merit for a devotee. Belief The Śvētāmbara Jains hold five centers of pilgrimage to be most sacred. These places are Shatrunjaya and Girnar in Gujarat, Mount Abu in Rajasthan, Shikharji in Bihar and Ashtapada in Himalayas. People who are unable to go for the pilgrimage, can achieve its religious merits by viewing cartographical overview of the pilgrimage site on Tirth Pat. Every year (in Oct-Nov), Tirth Pat is hung in the vicinity of a Jain temple or at a prepared location for devotees to worship.
