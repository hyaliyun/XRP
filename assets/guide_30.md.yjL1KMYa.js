Life Cobden was born in Chichester on 13 April 1794, the son of a builder Thomas Cobden and Mary Camp. Cobden had many siblings, as Thomas Cobden was a widower when he married Camp. Thomas Cobden the elder built Chichester Market House in 1807 with William Brooks, under the direction of John Nash. Nothing is known of Cobden's education, but it would appear he began in his father's trade as early as 1813. Cobden married Ann Fleming at Westminster St James 14 September 1821, with whom he had at least five children. Due to his work in the area, Cobden lived in Carlow for some time, building a house on College Street. He lived in London from 1832, and was living in 14 Upper Clapton Terrace, Hackney when he died 27 November 1842. His cause of death was recorded as \\"consumption\\". Cobden is buried in Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, Middlesex. Works It has been suggested that it was through his father's connections to Nash that Cobden began to get commissions in Ireland from the early 1810s. Cobden's work began with designs for Gurteen le Poer, County Waterford, for John William Power, and Wells House, County Wexford, for Robert Doyne. From 1835 to 1842, Cobden exhibited designs at Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Hibernian Academy. For the majority of his career, Cobden's work was in County Carlow and Wexford, with many of his clients being members of the landed gentry. Some of the resultant buildings were Braganza built for Sir Dudley Hill, Duckett's Grove, Russellstown Park, and the Tudor-revival Ballykealy House. In 1829, Cobden succeeded Joseph Lynch in overseeing the construction of the Cathedral of the Assumption in Carlow town. Cobden took much of his inspiration from Europe, in particular the Beffroi Tower in Bruges. This was just one of many churches Cobden was involved in designing, others include a Catholic church at Killeshin, and the Presbyterian church 'Scots' church' in Carlow town.

It is part of the larger War in Donbass. On 10 February 2015, the Azov battalion launched a surprise offensive against pro-Russian separatists associated with the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) with the aim of pushing the separatist forces away from Mariupol city limits. The village is located just from the Ukrainian-controlled city of Mariupol, and was used as a launching point for separatist attacks on the city, which served as the administrative centre of Donetsk Oblast whilst DPR forces control Donetsk city. Fighting continued until 3 July 2015, when DPR forces unilaterally withdrew from Shyrokyne. Subsequently a cease-fire was declared in the area. Background Mariupol had come under attack several times over the course of the War in Donbass, including in May‚ÄìJune 2014, when pro-Russian forces controlled the city, and in September 2014, when separatist forces tried to recapture the city prior to the signing of the Minsk Protocol. A separatist rocket attack, launched from the area around Shyrokyne on 24 January 2015, killed thirty civilians in Ukrainian-controlled Mariupol proper. Following this attack, Ukrainian forces, led by the Azov Battalion, began an offensive to stop the separatists from launching similar attacks. Events Ukrainian offensive Following the 24 January rocket attack, it became clear that Mariupol was vulnerable to further separatist attacks. Ukrainian forces said on 7 February that the DPR was massing forces for an attack on Mariupol. In response to these threats to the security of Mariupol, the National Guard of Ukraine, the Azov Battalion, and other Ukrainian volunteer groups launched an offensive to the east of the city, along the coast of the Azov Sea, toward Novoazovsk, on 10 February. The Ukrainian government said that the offensive was intended to eliminate insurgent positions near Mariupol, so as to stop shelling, and to regain positions demarcated as Ukrainian under the Minsk Protocol. Azov Battalion members, on the other hand, said that the goal of the offensive was to retake Novoazovsk, which had been under DPR control since a battle there in August 2014. The new Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol came as DPR and LPR forces were assaulting the strategic town of Debaltseve, to the north. Accordingly, the offensive was also intended to relieve pressure on Debaltseve by forcing the insurgents divert manpower and weaponry to the southern part of the line of contact. After breaking through DPR lines, the Azov Battalion managed to quickly capture the towns of Shyrokyne, Pavlopil, and Kominternove, and began to advance toward Novoazovsk. According to the battalion, Ukrainian flags were raised in Shyrokyne, Pavlopil and Oktyabr. Ukrainian forces pushed the separatists back to Sakhanka, about north-east of Shyrokyne, where DPR forces held the line. Ukrainian and DPR forces continued to fight at Sakhanka on 11 February, as Ukrainian forces led by the Azov Battalion attempted to secure the village. According to Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, the advance by Ukrainian forces into Sakhanka \\"moved the frontline to correspond exactly to the Minsk memorandum as a result of the counter-offensive\\". Shyrokyne was heavily bombarded by DPR artillery on 12 February. According to the Azov Battalion, the separatists had launched an all-out counter-offensive to curtail the Ukrainian advance, deploying tanks and artillery. Ukrainian forces suffered heavy losses amidst the bombardment, and the Battalion said that \\"Shyrokyne has been virtually wiped out\\" by the artillery fire. Subsequently, the Azov Battalion was forced to retreat from Sakhanka to Shyrokyne, leaving it under DPR control. Due to the fighting in the area around Shyrokyne, local emergency authorities evacuated all civilians from the Ukrainian government- controlled parts of Novoazovsk Raion to Mariupol. Minsk II A new ceasefire agreement, called Minsk II, was signed on 12 February. According to the agreement, a total ceasefire across the Donbass was to begin at midnight on 15 February. Despite this, five Ukrainian soldiers were killed and twenty- two were wounded in a DPR attack at Shyrokyne on 16 February. By the 21st of February, the Ukrainian government said that separatist forces were once again massing for a new offensive on Mariupol. NSDC spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that DPR forces were \\"conducting sabotage and intelligence operations round the clock to test government defences\\" in the area around Shyrokyne. DPR forces in Sakhanka had dug in, whilst those in and Bezimenne had established a base of operations in some houses there. Ukrainian officials said that Russia had sent tanks and soldiers toward Novoazovsk to reinforce the DPR, and a Reuters team said it saw men who \\"looked like Russian military special forces wearing Russian army patches and insignia on their uniforms\\" at Bezimenne. DPR forces recaptured the villages of Pavlopil and Pyshchevyk on 25 February. According to a Ukrainian official, these villages were in the buffer zone established by Minsk II, and hence had not been occupied by Ukrainian forces. Sporadic fighting continued in the Shyrokyne area, and The Guardian reported exchanges of artillery and machine gun fire. A local commander of the Donbas Battalion said that his forces had engaged the separatists, destroying an anti-aircraft gun and a petrol tanker. In addition, Ukrainian soldiers began to build a second defensive line in the adjacent village of Berdyanske, which lies just to the west of Shyrokyne. Continued concerns about a potential separatist offensive on Mariupol were bolstered by a report on 27 February that said that DPR heavy weaponry had been seen leaving Donetsk in the direction of Mariupol. Sporadic exchanges of fire continued over the next few days. The next major outbreak of fighting occurred on 9 March, when Ukrainian forces said that the DPR had launched a hail of tank and mortar fire onto Ukrainian positions in Shyrokyne. They said that the DPR was attempting to \\"force Ukrainian contingents from Shyrokyne\\". Whilst Ukrainian troops continued to hold the line, DPR forces managed to gain control of about 30 percent of the village by 21 March. By the end of the month, between 50 and 60 percent of Shyrokyne had been destroyed in the fighting. On 5 April, a landmine exploded under a military vehicle at Shyrokyne killing two soldiers and injuring a third, a military spokesman said on the TV channel 112. On 13 April, it was confirmed the separatists had captured the village of Vodyane, seven kilometers east of Mariupol, after it was in the middle of a no man's land for almost a month following a retreat by government troops. The next day, a Russian journalist was injured by a landmine in Skyrokyne during a tour as some of the heaviest fighting since February erupted. By 16 April, separatists were in control of much of Shyrokyne. On 18 April, a Georgian member of the Azov Battalion was killed in fighting near Shyrokyne. In late April, Deutsche Welle reported that pro-Russian militants had set up positions in the centre of Shyrokyne and that the OSCE and Red Cross were not always granted access. On 26 April, the OSCE observed what it assessed to be the most intense shelling in Shyrokyne since February. It also reported Pavlopil and Pyshchevyk to be once again government-held. On 5 May, 12 hours of sustained separatist attacks in Shyrokyne against Ukrainian positions near the beach took place, after a one-hour tank assault was launched, followed by constant firefights. In mid-June, as the Ukrainian president visited government lines at Mariupol, more fighting near Shyrokyne left one soldier dead and two wounded. Separatist withdrawal On 1 July, separatist forces proclaimed Shyrokyne to be a demilitarized zone and withdrew from the village. Denis Pushilin, the self-declared Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Donetsk People's Republic, stated that the decision to withdraw forces from Shyrokyne was made \\"as an act of good will and the demonstration of peaceful intentions.\\" On 3 July, the Ukrainian government confirmed the separatists had withdrawn from the village. According to Andriy Biletsky, commander of Ukraine's Azov Battalion which launched the offensive to seize the village in February 2015, the DNR's decision to leave was not due to their willingness to follow the Minsk agreement but due to the heavy casualties suffered by the separatists while battling to hold the village. OSCE observers confirmed areas of the village previously held by the \\"DNR\\" had been vacated, stating they \\"observed no armed formation in the village, except for some Ukrainian Armed Forces positions at the village's south-western edge.\\" As of 7 July, neither side controlled Shyrokyne as the Azov Battalion was holding positions on a nearby hill, while the separatists pulled back to another hill outside the village. Ukrainian fighters associated with the Right Sector group said that they would ignore any order to withdraw from the village, despite calls for it to become a demilitarised zone. A local Right Sector commander said that a withdrawal from Shyrokyne would expose Mariupol to attack, and that \\"only enemies of Ukraine can give an order to withdraw\\". Aftermath, demilitarization On 29 July, the volunteer battalions Azov and Donbass left their positions at the village and were replaced with a unit of active duty marines. The decision to pull out the Donbass battalion from Shyrokyne was met with protests from residents of Mariupol, who feared that the withdrawal would lead to Russian separatists quickly retaking the village and once again begin shelling the city. In early August, Ukrainian, Russian and OSCE representatives started forming a blueprint on the demilitarization of Shyrokyne. This was reportedly met with opposition from Mariupol residents and volunteer fighters, but the Ukrainian president stated that Ukrainian troops would remain on the heights outside the town. More skirmishes took place mid-August at Starohnativka, north of Mariupol, when two Ukrainian Marines were killed. Later that month, as negotiations were still being conducted for the demilitarization of the town, the Ukrainian Chief of General Staff commented that Shyrokyne had 'no military value'. This sparked outrage among some Ukrainian activists and volunteer soldiers. As of mid-September, Shyrokyne had become a demilitarized zone and Ukrainian forces were preventing civilians from returning to their homes due to a large number of explosive devices remaining in the area. Ukrainian military and separatist positions continued to be apart. On 25 February 2016, the Ukrainian military claimed that the separatists abandoned all of their positions around Shyrokyne, allowing them to take control of the town. According to the military, the retreating separatists extensively mined and booby trapped the area, with Ukrainian bomb squads still neutralizing these threats as of March 2016. Earlier, the OSCE stated that it was impossible for civilians to live in Shyrokyne.

He primarily plays the forward position, but has been known to even guard small forwards and shooting guards. Brown has experience in multiple minor league basketball leagues in North America and has also competed with several different teams around Europe. He also has played in Uruguay, Venezuela and Argentina. Brown played multiple seasons in the NBL Canada for the Quebec Kebs, Halifax Rainmen, and Express. In the league, he has earned three All-League selections and the Most Valuable Player Award. Outside Canada, Brown has been named All-Star in the Swedish League and the International Basketball League Uruguay LUB All-StarUruguay LUB Top 5 scoring[Venezuela LPB All-Star][(IBL). High school career Brown played for Morgan Park High School in the Chicago Public League, starring for the team in his senior year as they won the Public League in 2001. The same year, he led the Mustangs to the semifinals of the Illinois High School Association State Championship where they lost to Eddy Curry's Thornwood, with Brown making the All-Tournament team. Brown, rated as the No. 1 unsigned prospect from the state, was also named to the Class AA All-State team by the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association and the All-City team by the Public League coaches' association. College career Brown played for Wabash Valley College (Mount Carmel, Illinois) in the Great Rivers Athletic Conference (Region 24) of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Division I from 2001 to 2003. He averaged 10 points and 7 rebounds per game in his freshman season as Wabash finished fourth in the 2002 NJCAA Tournament played in Hutchinson, Kansas. As a sophomore, he received All-Conference and All-Regional Tournament honours, averaging 16 points (on 76% FGA) and 8 rebounds per game to help Wabash to a 22-10 record and a Regional runner-up finish, scoring 11 points as they conceded the Region 24 title to Southeastern Illinois. On April 16, 2003, he signed a letter of intent for Auburn University after visiting their campus the same month, choosing the Tigers over offers from Creighton, Ball State and Arizona State. As a junior, he averaged 7.1 points and 3 rebounds in 22.3 minutes per game as he started 16 of the 28 total games he and Auburn played in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) of the NCAA Division I, with a season-high 20 points in a game against Mississippi State. He was named Outstanding Defensive Player of the year at the team's season-ending awards banquet. The 6-foot-6 small forward was played as a nominal center during his senior year, starting each of the 31 games played by Auburn, for averages of 12.8 points and a team-high 6 rebounds (eleventh in the SEC) in 31.5 minutes per game. He scored a career-high 23 points during a November 24 game against Nicholls State, posted a double- double of 19 points and a career-high 13 rebounds in a February 12 game against South Carolina, making 7 of his 12 field goal attempts (including both 3-point attempts) and all of his three foul-shots, had 21 points (on perfect 8-for-8 shooting) in addition to 8 rebounds and 2 steals against Arkansas on senior day. Brown scored 13 points before fouling out with five minutes left as Auburn downed Vanderbilt in the first round of the 2005 SEC Tournament, however he only had 4 points and rebounds apiece (on 2-for-11 shooting, scoreless in 5 attempts from three) in 22 minutes against LSU the next round as Auburn lost 89-58 to end his college career. Professional career Brown started his professional career in Finland, spending the 2005 pre-season with KTP Palloilijat and playing the first game of the Korisliiga on September 30 (for 19 points and 7 rebounds in 37 minutes), however he was released by the side because they were looking for an out-and-out center. He joined Swedish Basketligan side Sundsvall Dragons in October 2005, playing 21 games before a finger injury sidelined him in January 2006. The Dragons were interested in re-signing him for 2006‚Äì07 but the deal fell through, he instead joined the ABA's Twin City Ballers in November 2006. He stayed with the side even when they went through financial problems (with player salaries getting slashed to $100 per game) and became a traveling team with Brown performing well in two February 2007 games, however, the team folded soon after and he finished the 2006‚Äì07 ABA season with the Detroit Panthers. After averaging 16.3 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game for the last eight games of the season, he was re-signed by the team in July 2007. Brown was again announced as a Sundsvall Dragons player in October 2007 but had yet to join the team at that point. He reached an agreement with the club to rescind his contract the same month, without playing a game. On February 4, 2008, he joined the Quad City Riverhawks of the Premier Basketball League (PBL). He helped the side win the PBL's Western Division regular season, and reach the postseason Division title game on March 21 where his 10 points were not enough as the Riverhawks lost to end the season. Also in February, he had been signed by the Gary Steelheads to play the International Basketball League season starting in mid-march. Joining the team after his stint with the Riverhawks, he soon impressed coach Rob Spon who praised his work ethic and versatility. He continued on his good form, making the league All-Star Game and scoring 32 points against the Holland Blast in the last regular season game on June 23, which ended the Steelheads' season as they withdrew from the playoffs for financial reasons. He played one exhibition game with another IBL side‚Äîthe Elkhart Express‚Äîon August 9, amidst doubts (later confirmed) that the team would not play the next season. On August 26, 2008, Brown returned to the Finnish Korisliiga after signing with Kataja. He averaged 14.0 points and 5.9 rebounds on average over 43 games in 2008‚Äì2009. On January 19, 2010, Brown signed a six-week deal with Benetton Fribourg Olympic of the Swiss Ligue Nationale de Basket (LNBA), temporarily replacing the injured Vladimir Buscaglia. He played only three games with Friboug, before his contract was cancelled on January 27 by the Swiss in order to recruit Ed Draughan. He played a April 3 IBL game (scoring 22 points) with the USA All-Stars, a team composed of tryout players. In October of the same year, he was announced as likely to play for the Elkhart Express again in exhibition games away to the Chinese national team. When former Gary Steelheads coach Robert Spon was chosen to coach Canadian PBL outfit Qu√©bec Kebs, he brought a number of his former players along with him, including Brown and former teammate Royce Parran to play the 2011 season starting in January. He had an immediate impact, leading the team in scoring (22,3 points per game), rebounding (8.3 pg) and blocks (3 pg), with two nominations for league weekly MVP. This success continued into the season as he was the league's top scorer with more than 21 points per game, he later added the PBL season MVP title, whilst the Kebs' season ended on April 9 following a contentious playoff semifinals defeat to the Rochester Razorsharks. His next stop in early May was with another Canadian side, the IBL's Edmonton Energy. However, he left the team in late May due to what were described as family issues. In September 2011, the American joined Cuxhaven BasCats to play the 2011‚Äì12 German second division 2. Basketball Bundesliga season. He played 18 games for 14.6 points and 5.9 rebounds per game, He suffered a hand injury that sidelined him from January, when it became apparent he wouldn't recover in time to play again for the BasCats he asked to be released from his contract and left the team on February 21, 2012. Later that month, Brown reunited with the Quebec Kebs, who had in between joined the newly created National Basketball League of Canada (NBL), which was made up of several former PBL teams. He made his league debut on February 23, 2012, in a loss to the Halifax Rainmen, scoring 0 points in just 1 minute of play. Brown was named NBL Canada Most Valuable Player in 2015 and subsequently won the league championship. Personal Quinnel Levar Brown's second name was given to him in reference to actor LeVar Burton, who played Geordi La Forge in Star Trek: The Next Generation, he is nicknamed Q by friends and teammates.

It is almost the same as the Kishumikan. It is sometimes called a grown on Sakurajima, an active composite volcano in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. The same cultivar is also grown in Fukuyama in Kirishima along Kagoshima Bay, and this is simply called komikan (Â∞è„Åø„Åã„Çì, Â∞èËúúÊüë). Summary Because the soil is rich in volcanic ash, Sakurajima is not suitable for rice cultivation, so the 'komikan' is an important commercial crop. Some of the huge trees have been standing for over 200 years and sometimes a few hundred kilograms of mikan are produced from a single tree. The fruits ripen at the beginning of December and it turns into a flattened spherical shape that weighs anything from 20 to 50 grams. Its pith is hard but sweet-tasting. History There are three theories about how \\"Sakurajima Komikan\\" were first cultivated. The first is that Shimazu Yoshihiro, the second son of Shimazu Takahisa, who was the daimy≈ç of Satsuma Province, took back the oranges to Satsuma from the Korean Peninsula after the two Japanese invasions of Korea (1592 and 1598). Otherwise, from Kii Province after the Battle of Sekigahara (on October 21, 1600). The third theory is that he brought back \\"Takada mikan\\" oranges from Yatsushiro in Higo Province (present-day Kumamoto). This opinion is the most popular. It has become a specialty of Satsuma because Naotomo Yamaguchi, Tokugawa Ieyasu's retainer, admired its great taste. In 1603, it was presented to Tokugawa Ieyasu by Shimazu Tadatsune, tozama daimy≈ç of Satsuma. In ancient times, it was referred to as \\"Mukoujima Mikan\\" or \\"Aka Mikan\\" but it started to be called \\"Sakurajima Mikan\\" in around 1658.

Seven people died. This remains the worst streetcar accident ever to occur in the city of Portland and also the worst bridge disaster in Portland history. The first Madison Street Bridge  Second (rebuilt) Madison Bridge at Portland, Oregon, showing swing span Opened in January 1891, the first Madison Street Bridge was a swing bridge which pivoted on a large central trunnion mounted on a piling structure in the river. The bridge was poorly designed. At the time of the accident, the bridge was owned by the City of Portland. The disaster Opening the draw On November 1, 1893, in foggy weather after dawn, the sternwheeler Elwood approached the bridge, and gave the signal to open the draw, one long and three short blasts on the steam whistle. To allow the steamer to pass, the bridge operator swung open the swinging draw section of the bridge. The bridge tender closed the wooden gates on each side of the draw and hung a red signal light as a warning. The streetcar approaches The streetcar Inez photographed on an unknown date before the accident At about 6:45 a.m. on November 1, 1893, the streetcar Inez, owned by the East Side Railway Company, arrived at the Madison Street Bridge, running westbound into the city with 18 to 20 passengers on board, as well as the motorman and the conductor. All the streetcars were named in those times. Inez was coming from Milwaukie. Some passengers got off, and one witness said there were about 15 passengers on board when the car reached the bridge. The night before had been cold and frost covered the rails. The car had departed from Oak Grove at about 5:55 a.m. that morning. Policeman J. J. Flynn, whose post was on the east side of the bridge, stated that he had seen the streetcar pass and had thought it was running somewhat fast, but he paid not too much attention to it. His job was to make sure that carts and horse-drawn vehicles slowed to a walking pace when crossing the bridge. However, he had received no instructions as to speeds of the trolleys. His statement concluded, however: \\"I think the car was running too fast.\\" Captain Lee, on Elwood, said to a reporter on November 1 that he could see the light on the car, and from the sound, he thought it was moving fast across the bridge, and the motorman might not realize that the draw was open. Shouted and whistled warnings Captain Lee, on the steamer Elwood, shown here at Portland, tried to warn the streetcar by blowing hard on the riverboat's steam whistle. An 18-year-old man, Joe Kutcher, saw the streetcar move onto the bridge and thought nothing of it, until he heard someone behind him shout \\"Stop that car!\\" A messenger boy for a local brewery, W. B. Crabtree, also walking across the bridge, heard someone shout: \\"Stop the car! The bridge is open!\\". On the steamer Elwood, Captain Lee sounded the Elwood whistle hard, hoping the motorman would hear it and realize the danger. Brakes fail to stop the car The motorman, Edward F. Terry, gave a sworn statement before Portland Mayor William S. Mason (1832‚Äì1899) and chief of police Hunt. According to the motorman, he had not seen the red light indicating the draw was open until one bridge span (about 80 feet) away. He tried applying the brakes, but the car slid along the track. He jumped from the car onto the bridge before it went over the gap into the river. The conductor, W. C. Powers, also gave a statement. He said the car was not going very fast as it started across the bridge. As soon as he saw the red light, he opened the trolley's door and alerted the passengers to jump from the car. The conductor then jumped himself, just before the car struck the wooden gate before the open draw. He saw a number people jump off the car. The car goes into the river In 1893, Kutcher stated that he had turned and saw the car about from the gate, and coming very fast. According to Kutcher's statement: Kutcher saw the car teeter briefly on the brink, and then fall into the water. He saw a man's head, wearing a black hat, appear above the surface, just before the steamer passed over him. Two passengers on the car, G. W. Hoover and William Kenner, who had both leapt from the car, both agreed there were only three people on the car when it went off the bridge. This proved to be inaccurate. On Elwood, Captain Lee saw the car go into the river. Lee said at the time that had the Elwood been just about a boat length ahead, the car would have struck the steamer. Attempted rescue of people in the water Passenger G. W. Hoover said that he had been riding on the car, and had to push a woman, who he said was paralyzed with fear, out of the car ahead of him. Hoover also said he saw the steamer Elwood pass through the draw, and run over two men who were struggling in the water. Hoover said the steamer made no attempt to slow down. Hoover's account of Elwood actions was disputed by the boat's captain, James Lee, and the mate and the fireman. They stated that the steamer stopped before reaching the draw, tied up at the pivot pier, and did everything possible to help the people in the water, throwing over life-preservers, planks and staging. They said they had launched a boat to try to save people. Using the boat, they rescued the only man who survived the car's plunge into the river, who was found floating on the Elwood's gangplank. The Morning Oregonian reported that right after Elwood passed through the draw, the steamer had lowered a boat to attempt to save two men who were still struggling to stay afloat in the water. One man sank before they could reach him, and the other was dead when the boat picked him up. G. W. Hoover and Captain Lee later composed their differences. Lee and Hoover came together to The Oregonian on the evening of November 7, 1893. Hoover said that he was now satisfied, from the testimony of the other witnesses, that Lee had done everything he could have to save the people in the accident. Hoover also said that he had obtained the dismissal of the criminal charges which Hoover had brought against Lee. Lee denied that he had dragged Hoover to the morgue, and said that Hoover had gone willingly. Recovery of bodies and salvage Thousands of people gathered on the bridge and the docks in the area, and exaggerated rumors of the scale of the accident spread through the city. An hour after the accident, drag lines were being used to find bodies, and at 9:30 the first one was recovered, and immediately identified as that of John P. Anderson, a cabinet maker from Milwaukie. By 11:00 a.m. the bodies of Alexander Campbell, a saloon keeper from Midway and Jasper Stadler, a laborer from Oak Grove, were recovered. At that time the tug C.M. Belshaw brought two construction barges to the wreck site, to use their hoisting equipment to recover the streetcar. A diver, George A. Tilden, brought his equipment out to one of the barges, and at 1:15 p.m. he made his first dive. Tilden found the streetcar on the bottom of the river, in water about deep, tipped slightly to one side and lying nearly parallel to the bridge. The car had come off the trucks, and the roof was completely crushed. The platform had been separated from the car body, and half of one side of the car had been smashed. The car interior was so jammed with wreckage that Tilden could neither enter the interior nor determine whether there were any bodies inside. At 2:00 p.m. Tilden was able to secure heavy chains to each end of the car, and when he returned to the barge, the chains were cranked up slowly to raise the car. When the car broke the surface, people in rowboats, who had come out to watch, slipped under the ropes placed around the area, impeding the operation. Before the car was completely raised, the hoist was stopped while the police, under Captain Holmberg, searched the car. They found one body inside, that of Theodore Bennick, also a cabinet maker from Milwaukie, who was identified by a memo book found in a pocket. Tilden went down again to search for more bodies, but none were found, and concluded his diving work at 4:30 p.m. that day. The two missing persons, whose bodies were not found, were Paul Oder, bottling department foreman at the Gambrinus brewery, and a boy, Charles S. Albee, aged 14, who worked as a paper hanger. Their bodies were initially presumed to have washed downstream, but were later recovered, Oder's on the evening of November 2 and Albee's on the morning of November 3, 1893. As of Thursday, November 3, a man named Peterson was still missing, who would be the eighth victim. The coroner's jury A coroner's jury was convened on the evening November 2. The motorman and the conductor testified, giving statements similar to what they had told the police on the day of the accident. J. C. Cooper, a motorman with two years' experience on the Washington Street streetcar line, testified that a major factor in causing the accident was frost on the rails, and that even the use of sand (which the Inez did not have) would not have prevented the wheels from slipping on the rail. George A. Steel, president of the East Side Railway Company, also testified before the coroner's jury. Steel's evidence was that the company had no control over the Madison Street bridge, the gates, or the draw. The city had purchased the bridge some time before, and the company only paid the city rent for use of the bridge for the streetcar line. The coroner's jury continued to take evidence on Friday morning, November 3. W. A. Burkholder, assistant superintendent of the Portland General Electric Light Company, testified that on the morning of the accident, that the ice on the rails \\"acted like grease\\" and that sand would have slowed the car. An electrical warning system could be set up on the Morrison bridge at a small cost. W. B. Chase, engineer of the Portland bridge commission, testified that the only safety warning devices on the Madison Street bridge were the gates at the draw and a red warning light, although in foggy weather a gong was kept sounding when the draw was open. When the draw was open early in the morning, no one was placed at the east side of bridge to caution traffic, although during the day and the evening, two men were placed on duty. The gates were not placed to stop streetcars. A gate that could wreck a streetcar could be built, but these were not ordinarily placed on bridges. Chase testified further that the bridge commission had considered the speed of streetcars across the bridge, but had been unable to control it. He had issued an order to have motormen cross the bridge very slowly, but this order had been violated, and he had to have President Steel issue new orders. Chase agreed with Burkholder that an electric signal system could be established. Chase testified that the means of stopping cars on the bridge was not within the responsibility of the bridge commission. On the evening of Friday, November 3, 1893, the coroner's jury completed its investigation and returned its findings and recommendations. The jury found that the motorman was grossly negligent, by running the car at excessive speed across the bridge when the rails were slippery from ice and the weather was foggy. The jury recommended that a better system of warning signals be installed on the bridge. The jury commended Captain Lee and the crew of the Elwood for their work in attempting to rescue the people in the water. Witness brings charges against steamer captain G. W. Hoover, the passenger who said Elwood had run down two passengers in the water, swore out an affidavit in support of a warrant for the arrest of Captain Lee, claiming that Lee had threatened to kill him. According to Hoover, \\"Captain Lee called at my place of business and demanded to see me, but was so excited that they would not permit him to do so. He threatened to kill me, and kept his hand on his hip pocket. He wanted me to go aboard his boat, where he said he had twenty-five men to testify that he had not run down any men in the water.\\" Criminal charges against the motorman Criminal charges were brought against the motorman of Inez, Edward F. Terry. On Friday, February 2, 1894, Judge Manley sustained Terry's demurrer to the indictment filed against him, and ordered the case resubmitted to the grand jury. This was the second time that the indictment had been resubmitted to the grand jury. Company ruined The lawsuits associated with the accident ruined the East Side Railway, which was forced into receivership on December 9, 1893.

Robin is a finished comic book series published by DC Comics with Lee Bermejo as dual artist and writer, along with other artists Rob Haynes, Jorge Corona, and Khary Randolph. The first issue was released in June 2015 and the last issued in May 2016. It took place after Batman: Endgame while Bruce Wayne had amnesia and was unable to don his mantle. The name \\"We Are... Robin\\" also plays into the current Robin being away from the city, with teens filling in the gap both heroes left. Background Batman: No√´l writer Lee Bermejo explains We Are... Robin is a new approach to showcase diversity in the DC Universe for readers. On the subject of expanding the character of Robin, he explained, \\"With ideas and big concepts, teenagers can get really passionate about that stuff and it can be their whole life. That was something interesting to me, that this thing could be bigger than just one guy jumping around in a domino mask\\". According to Bermejo, his inspiration for the series came from the question of why Batman would put a child out on the streets to fight crime, thus risking placing him in danger. While We Are... Robin will not focus on past Robins Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake or the incumbent Damian Wayne, Bermejo does not rule out featuring them in the future. By bringing in different characters as Robin, he hopes to create a different dynamic with the identity. \\"You can take that concept of Robin and really play with it and really stretch it and expand upon it and bend it,\\" Bermejo said. \\"It still will hold resemblance to the core of the character in the Bat- mythos\\" Plot Duke Thomas, a victim of the Joker, attempts to search for his family in the months following Batman: Endgame, becoming a delinquent due to being forced to live on the streets. While being arrested, a teenage girl takes a photo of him and sends it to a group chat with the caption \\"found him\\".

Duke sneaks out, and is followed by several unseen members. Duke makes his way into the sewers, and follows two people who allude to being in a cult like group. He finds an underground town in a cavern, where many people are being preached to by a man. The man speaks of a terrorist plot to destroy Gotham City, and alludes to a King that presides over the group orders it, and he is merely a mouth piece. During this speech, Duke is singled out as an outsider, and everyone in the cavern attempts to attack him. He is saved by the group that followed him, finally revealing their name \\"We Are Robin.\\" An unknown man uses hidden cameras to watch the Robins fight, in a monologue, he admits to being the organizer and benefactor of the Robin group, revealing a cache of gear and outfits.We Are Robin #1 See also * List of Batman comics References Robin (character) titles 2015 comics debuts ","title":"We Are...

Situated at the edge of the city's northern section, it measures in length, and covers an area of . It is known for its eponymous palm trees and resorts, as well as the Palmeraie Rotana Resort\\"Rotana enters Morocco with the management of Marrakech‚Äôs iconic five- star Palmeraie Resort\\", and Nikki Beach. It is approached on the Circuit de la Palmeraie, which branches off from the N8 highway to Fez. History Although legend mentions that this Palmeraie was created from date seeds cast off centuries ago by Arab warriors, it was created during the Almoravid period, using a khettara network. The ancient tale (more than 1000 years old) refers to this garden of palm trees as \\"the ardent children of the African earth and sun\\". Sultan Yussef Ben Tachefine, while searching for land to establish his Almoravid dynasty had camped at the plain of Haouz. His soldiers, who had camped there, after consuming palm-dates had thrown the date seeds around and some of them had dropped into holes created by the lances which they had pitched there, and these sprouted into trees. Many centuries later the same plain had become an oasis of a lush garden of 50,000 trees. Here, Stuart Church, an American architect and designer, and Jaoud Kadiri created their dream project of building an edifice of oriental culture and Buddhist philosophy, which they called the Dar Alhind, which is a mansion which permeates the spirit and traditions of India. Now there are over 100,000 date palms, as well as olive and fruit trees. In the present day, nearby reservoirs and artesian wells supply the irrigation. In the town planning norms of the 1920s, buildings were not allowed be built to heights taller than the palm trees and as a result palm trees have grown in pavements also. However, in recent years urbanization has affected the area.

History Olga Blinder and Carlos Colombino a circulating collection in 1972 of prints and drawings for public spaces and educational displays. As their collection grew and diversified, they needed a permanent location to house it. The Museo del Barro was founded in 1979 as a private institution to house the large indigenous pottery collection (clay) reflected in its name. However, it also serves as the Indigenous Art Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Arts of Paraguay. The three divisions make up the bulk of the museum's collection. Originally the location was in San Lorenzo but with expansions, and natural disasters. The clay museum houses over 300 pieces of pre-Columbian ceramics, and contains some 4,000 items of wood, fabric, and metal from the 17th century to the present day. In the indigenous section are 1,700 pieces produced by the different ethnic groups that make up the Paraguayan population. Baskets, masks and feather work typify the collection. The third part of the museum is dedicated to contemporary artists from throughout Latin America. There are approximately 3,000 works by Paraguayan, Argentinean, Brazilian, and Chilean artists, including drawings, paintings, prints, sculpture and mixed media.

The story takes place across the Indian subcontinent starting from the holy town of Allahabad. It visits several holy sites in India. The story takes place in various places of spiritual importance in India. The novel deals with mythological themes, with a conflict between a newly active historical sect worshipping Shiva and a powerful secret organization, the Nine Unknown Men. Plot summary A murder takes place in the town of Haridwar. The victim is a history professor who had little or no affinity with the place. The killer is unknown but has left some religious symbols on the naked body of the professor which is found a few kilometers away from the place of murder. A week later, another murder takes place in similar circumstances in the holy town of Srikakulam. Troubled by the murder of two of his most trusted allies and by two subsequent heists in Kolkata and Bikaner, the working head of National Society for Hindu Consciousness, Mrityunjai Pradhan turns to the Intelligence Bureau of India for help in the case. Themes The book deals with two major themes. First of all, it deals with the historical achievements of India. This is done by referring to the Nine Unknown Men from Talbot Mundy's 1923 novel. The novel explores the history and usage of some ancient Indian technology and art appearing in their books. The second theme is the signs and symbols related to Shiva, a Hindu deity. Characters and locations The main characters of the novel are Shoumik Haldar ‚Äì Deputy Director of the Information Bureau of India. Ishan Vajpayee ‚Äì An author.

The name of this vessel is sometimes seen spelled \\"Ellwood\\". Elwood is probably best known for an incident in 1893, when it was approaching the Madison Street Bridge over the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. The bridge swung open to allow the steamer to pass. However, a streetcar coming in from the east end of the bridge failed to notice the bridge was open, and ran off into the river in the Madison Street Bridge disaster. Construction Elwood was built in 1891 at Portland, Oregon by Johnston & Oleson, for the concern of Jason Eldridge and the three brothers Guy V. Abernethy, Charles H. Abernethy, and George Abernethy, of Champoeg, Oregon. Another source gives the builder as Joseph Pacquart. The Abernethy brothers were descendants of George Abernethy (c1807-1877), provisional governor of Oregon. The owners placed Elwood on the Willamette River, operating first with Capt. J.L. Smith, who was followed by Capt. R. Young and then by Captain James Lee, who as of 1895 had been in charge of the vessel for about 3 years. Elwood was intended to operate in opposition to the O.R.&N.;, and another line, the Oregon Pacific.A non- contemporaneous source states that Elwood was built for the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (O.R. & N). . However, based on contemporaneous sources, it appears that Elwood was built to compete against the O.R.&N.; Design, size, engineering and accommodations Design and size  Elwood was intended to be a shallow-draft boat capable of passing the Clackamas Rapids on the lower Willamette and of operating on the upper Willamette river when water levels were down. It was said that Elwood was \\"built to run on a heavy dew\\". Elwood was so lightly built that it could not operate on longer runs on the Columbia such as to the Cascades or Astoria, Oregon. The official steamboat registry number was 136181. Elwood official registered dimensions were measured over hull (not counting the rather long extension of the main deck which housed the sternwheel), beam, again measured over the hull, and not counting the guards, which were low strakes of timbers placed along the outboard top of the hull as a protective measure. Depth of hold was . The vessel's tonnage, a measure of capacity and not weight, was 510.44 gross tons and 420.54 net tons. The boat drew only of water when light (empty of cargo and passengers). With 100 tons of freight loaded, the vessel was expected to draw only about of water. Engineering Elwood was powered by twin horizontally-mounted steam engines, each with a bore and a 72-inch stroke. The engines were manufactured by Iowa by the Dubuque Iron Works, and were of the Poppet-valve type. The boiler had 186 tubes, each long. The boiler was licensed to produce steam at 165 pounds pressure. Engine room signals were given from the pilot house by speaking tube, and manual and electric bells. There was a fog bell on the upper deck. Accommodations Elwood had cabins forward and aft, and six staterooms. With a special license, Elwood would be able to legally carry 250 passengers. Service on the Willamette River Advertisement for Elwood, 1892. Elwood made its trial trip on Wednesday afternoon, May 27, 1891. Elwood departed the Portland & Willamette Valley dock shortly after 4:00 pm., and proceeded a few miles downriver. The owners had invited on board guests for the trial trip, including a number from Salem, among whom were representatives of the two Salem newspapers. Robert Young was the first captain of Elwood, and Charles Abernethy was the boat's first manager. The next day, Thursday, May 28, 1891, Elwood left the Kellogg dock in Portland, and was expected to arrive in Salem that same evening to load freight. Hit snag and sunk At about 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday August 25, 1891, while carrying passengers and a cargo of 500 sacks of oats, Elwood hit a snag at Ash Island, about 35 miles south of Portland, and sank. The steamer had just left the mouth of the Yamhill River, and, with mate John Ditmer at the wheel, was running in a stretch of deeper water close to shore known as Ash Island channel. Here the vessel ran into a snag which was about one foot under the surface of the water and about 20 feet from shore. The current spun the boat around sidewise and the snag ripped a hole half the length of the hull, sinking the vessel cabin-deep, and rendering cargo of oats a total loss. There was no casualty to the passengers, and they were easily brought off the boat to the river bank. Total damage was estimated at $1,000, of which $400 represented damage to the cargo. Plans were made immediately to raise Elwood and bring it downriver for repairs. 1892 and 1893 operations Racing brings criminal charges On May 4, 1892, Elwood left Salem at the same time as the steamer Hoag. A race followed, and the crew of Elwood claimed they won. On Monday, May 9, 1892, E.A. Kern, the chief engineer of Elwood, was arrested and charged with disabling the safety valve on Elwood boiler, so that steam at 195 pounds pressure could be raised, instead of the 165-pound maximum that was allowed on the boiler's certificate. The assistant engineer, T.C. Fitzgerald, was also arrested on similar charges. On Friday, May 13, 1892, Kern was brought before U.S. Commissioner Paul H. Deady the day after the arrest, and he posted bond of $500 to secure his release during the pendency of the case. If convicted, Kern would have faced a potential file of $200 and a maximum prison sentence of five years. The Morning Oregonian wrote at the time: Collision with Stark Street Ferry On the evening of October 29, 1892, when Elwood was tied to the wharf at Alder Street, in Portland, the Stark Street Ferry ran into the sternwheeler. Elwood fantail was badly damaged, as was the tackle on the ferry. The ferry was forced to suspend operations for two hours to make repairs. Damage to both vessels was estimated at $25. No one was blamed for the accident, as it was quite dark and the ferry captain thought there was enough room to make a safe landing. Portland‚ÄìAlbany run As of May 5, 1893, Elwood was running twice a week between Portland and Albany, Oregon. Madison Street bridge disaster Elwood was involved in the Madison Street Bridge streetcar disaster, when on the morning of November 1, 1893, the swinging draw section of the Madison Street Bridge, in Portland, opened to allow passage of the boat, and a streetcar on the bridge failed to stop for the open draw. 1894 operations 1894 schedule Advertisement for steamer Elwood, placed April 5, 1894 in Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon. As of April 5, 1894, Elwood departed Portland for Salem and Corvallis on Sundays and Wednesdays at 6:00 a.m. Elwood left Salem for Portland Tuesdays and Saturdays at 6:00 a.m. The passenger fare from Salem to Portland was $1.00. Frank J. Smith, with an office at the Trade Street Dock, was the Salem agent for the steamer. Smith had taken over the Salem agency for Elwood from Albert Herren, reportedly a popular steamboat agent, in November 1893. Loss of an engineer On April 10, 1894, Willam Armstrong, second engineer, was lost off the Elwood while the boat was en route from Oregon City to Salem. The incident occurred near Fairfield, which was 16 miles downriver from Salem. No one saw Armstrong go overboard. The chief engineer stepped out of the engine room briefly, and when he returned, he noticed Armstrong missing. An oil can was also missing, and Armstrong's cap was on the machinist's bench. The supposition was that Armstrong had gone out on the fan tail to oil the sternwheel bearings, slipped off, and fell into the river. A few days previously Armstrong had told Captain Lee that he could not swim. On May 10, 1894, Armstrong's body was found in the boom of the old Mission Mill, about 18 miles downriver from where he had been lost. Two wounds on the body's head were thought to be consistent with the theory that he had been struck on the head by the buckets of the paddle wheel. Armstrong's gold watch was found still attached to his vest by the chain. The body was taken to Oregon City, where his parents resided, for burial. Rate war with Union Pacific In early 1894, the Union Pacific Railroad placed a steamboat on the upper Willamette River, the Modoc, to compete with Elwood. Before placing Modoc into service, the Union Pacific had cooperated with Elwood, allowing the independent steamer to use the railroad's dock at Salem. However, on April 1, 1892, Union Pacific sent a telegram to their Salem agent, instructing him to no longer allow Elwood to use their dock. Elwood owners shifted over immediately to the Oregon Pacific floating wharf. George E. Abernethy was Elwood manager at the time. The fare war reduced shipping rates which benefited the merchants of Salem. Transfer to Lewis River service On May 26, 1894, Charles H. Abernethy was reported to come to Salem to close up the business of the Elwood, which he had tied up at his residence at Champoeg. Abernethy did not expect to be running the vessel before fall. In 1894, Elwood was leased by the Lewis River Transportation Service to replace Mascot on the Lewis River run. A non-contemporaneous source states that it was the very successful steamboatman Jacob Kamm who leased Elwood for the Portland ‚Äì Lewis River route. Kamm appears to have controlled the Lewis River Transportation company, and he may have purchased rather than leased Elwood. The Abernethy brothers were reported to have lacked the necessary experience in steamboating and to have returned to farming after having been bested by the competition.  1895 wheat harvest in the Willamette valley Altona (left) and Elwood (right) at Salem, Oregon. In August 1895, it was reported that \\"an immense lot of wheat\\" was being delivered to the Imperial Mills at Oregon City from landings on the upper Willamette River. As of August 23, 1895, Elwood had been engaged for ten days carrying wheat from Mission Landing (near St. Paul) and other points on the upper river to the mills at Oregon City. 1896 and 1897 operations Race with Hattie Belle Despite the 1892 arrest of Engineer Kern for complicity in a steamboat race, Elwood was again involved in a race in 1896, with the sternwheeler Hattie Belle. Hattie Belle entered the Willamette River from the Columbia about 200 yards ahead of Elwood, which overtook Hattie Bell at Post Office Bar. Post Office Bar was a short distance from the mouth of the Willamette. As Elwood passed Hattie Belle, the two vessels came so close together that Hattie Belle was carried along in the suction created by the passage of Elwood, a larger vessel. The two boats ran this manner all the way to the Steel Bridge. This was a distance of 12.1 miles from the mouth of the Willamette. At the Steel Bridge, the two boats separated, and Hattie Belle was able to pull into the dock first. Reassignment to upper Willamette In late September 1896, Elwood was tied up and undergoing extensive repairs at Jacob Kamm's dock in Portland at Taylor Street. Kamm had not yet decided whether to place Elwood back on the upper Willamette route. There were already about ten steamers operating on the upper Willamette at that time, and it wasn't clear whether there would be enough business to support another. Kamm, however, did not seem to be particularly concerned, saying that \\"when a man owned steamers, he had to run them somewhere.\\"  Hop season 1897 To meet the needs for carriage of pickers for the 1897 hops season in the Willamette Valley, Elwood was engaged by the Oregon City Transportation Company, leaving Portland on the morning of August 27, 1897, to carry pickers as far upriver as the water conditions, generally low at the end of the summer, would permit. Elwood operated on the upper Willamette to transport pickers for the hop season. 2,500 people from Portland sought transport to the hop yards for picking work. On Sunday morning, August 29, 1897, both Elwood and another sternwheeler, Altona, transported a full load of passengers, most of whom were landed at Butteville. Some were taken further upriver to Salem by the steamer Ramona, where they arrived at 9:45 pm Sunday night. Transfer to the Stikine River Booster map of 1898 showing claimed proximity of the \\"Gold Belt\\" to the Stikine river steamboat terminus. In 1898, with the coming of the Alaska Gold Rush, Elwood was sent north to Alaska to run on the Stikine River, where there was an effort being made to develop an alternative \\"All-Canadian\\" route to the Klondike gold fields. Sale to Canadian interests In 1898, Elwood was sold to an Alaskan company and transferred to the Stikine River in British Columbia. On February 6, 1898, it was reported that a Canadian shipbuilder, W.J. Stephens, while in Portland, had, on behalf of Victoria, BC interests, purchased Elwood from the Lewis River Transportation Company The new owner was reported in one source to be the Lake Bennett & Klondike Navigation Company. Another source gives the new owner as the Cassiar Central Railway. Still a third source states the new owner was the Canadian Pacific. Tow to Alaska On Monday afternoon, April 18, 1898, Elwood departed Portland in the tow of the tug Relief bound for the Stikine River. Captain Johnson, who had once commanded the Columbia River sternwheeler Dalles City, was in charge of the vessel. Charles Jennings was the engineer. The total complement was 16. No equipment or supplies were loaded, other than those necessary for the crew for the trip north. Elwood in tow of Relief was scheduled to depart Astoria, Oregon early in the morning on Wednesday, April 20, 1898, for Puget Sound and thereafter to Alaska. Relief was a powerful steel tug built by sugar magnate Claus Spreckels. Relief had completed the tow of the former Willamette River steamer Ramona to the Stikine earlier the same year. Elwood arrived in Victoria, BC on April 21, 1898, and was expected to depart soon for the north for survey and construction work, with a crew of 15 and Captain Johnson in command. Operations on the Stikine By May 8, 1898, Elwood had arrived at Fort Wrangell and departed up the Stikine River bound for Glenora, British Columbia. Elwood was then one of seven sternwheelers to have steamed up the river for Glenora, which was a four-day round trip from Fort Wrangell. By May 22, 1898, Elwood had completed two round trips. Closure of the Stikine route By the summer of 1898, the Stikine route had failed due to the extreme difficulty of reaching gold fields overland from the steamboat terminus. Elwood performed well on the Stikine River, carrying 200 tons of cargo or 250 passengers. After a year on the Stikine River, Elwood was reported to have been transferred to the Fraser River. Another source states that Elwood was transferred to Ketchikan, Alaska. Operations on Puget Sound In the early 1900s, Elwood was operated on Puget Sound by Capt. H.H. McDonald, (c.1857-1924), who also operated Skagit Queen, and, after 1903, Multnomah and Capital City. McDonald was doing business as the McDonald Steamship Company. Elwood was placed on a route between Seattle and Tacoma.  Loss by fire On August 16, 1904, while unloading freight at Avon, Washington, Elwood caught fire and burned. The fire's origin was unknown. The total value of the loss was reported to have been $12,000. The steamer had just pulled up to the landing at Avon, on the Skagit River. Some time between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., a fire started. The fire's origin has been reported conflictingly in the contemporaneous sources. One source says the fire began in the forecastle. Another source says the fire started in the engine room. All sources agree that wherever it started, the fire quickly spread, and the vessel became a total loss. The machinery was so damaged that it was \\"practically worthless.\\" The crew was said to have \\"narrowly escaped with their lives.\\" Elwood was reported to have been worth about $15,000. Elwood place on the route would be taken over by the Skagit Queen. Historical remembrance A photograph of Elwood was chosen to be featured on the membership cards of the Veteran Steamboatmen's Association for 1942. Two of the first owners of Elwood, Guy V. Abernethy and Charles H. Abernethy, were still living in 1942, at Ocean Park, Washington, and were honored at the 17th Annual Meeting of the Veteran Steamboatmen of the West, held at Jantzen Park, Portland, Oregon, on Sunday, June 28, 1942. The Elwood Building, part of the Hassalo on Eighth apartment complex in Portland's Lloyd District, is named after the steamboat.

The novel consists of a present-day trail of cryptic riddles scattered across India that must be solved one by one to unveil an ancient Indian secret. This journey plays out in the context of an esoteric legend involving one of the most iconic Emperors of the history of India. The book was first released at the New Delhi World Book Fair in February 2014. It turned out to be a bestselling thriller with the media calling it \\"a hit with young readers\\". Plot synopsis The novel opens with the bizarre murder of historian Ram Mathur at the Ganga ghat in Varanasi. As his daughter Sia, her close friend Om Patnaik, and TV producer Jasodhara investigate the killing, they find a series of cryptic riddles scattered across the country that they must crack one by one to reach a final enigma. Meanwhile, Chief Officer Parag Suri and journalist Alia Irani are chasing the killer branded as \\"Scorpion\\" by the media due to his choice of weapon, a poisoned syringe. At the same time a holy Buddhist Bhikkhu urges his young Samanera Tathagata to make an important journey that promises to alter his life. Parallel to this is a second storyline which tells the story of the life of a young prince in Ancient India who becomes one of the most celebrated Emperors in history, and who envisions a secret project which could affect the entire world. Characters *Om Patnaik ‚Äì esoteric writer and family friend who is called upon the event of Ram Mathur's murder and joins his daughter Sia to crack the cryptic riddles and solve the mystery *Sia Mathur ‚Äì daughter of murdered historian Ram Mathur who joins Om Patnaik on the trail of riddles towards the final revelation *Ram Mathur ‚Äì historian in Sarnath and Sia's father who is brutally murdered *Jasodhara ‚Äì Television documentarian who assists Om and Sia in solving the mysterious riddles and penetrate the mystery *Parag Suri ‚Äì Chief Inspector investigating Mathur's murder and similar serial murders afoot *Alia Irani ‚Äì journalist who joins Suri in tracking the killer and solving the mystery *Tathagata ‚Äì Buddhist Samanera who walks the trail to see the 'Sights' *Bhikkhu ‚Äì the Buddhist monk who directs Tathagata *The Emperor ‚Äì the man at the heart of the legend Development and publication The idea for The Emperor's Riddles was born out of a random Internet search by Nayak after reading the Dan Brown thriller Angels & Demons to find out if there was something similarly esoteric and mysterious hidden in the history of India. The surfing yielded an obscure but fascinating conspiracy theory involving one of the greatest Emperors of ancient India. Nayak was intrigued by the Emperor's legend and the imperial secret believed to be still alive and functioning and decided to capture this story. The first draft took about six months and was ready in 2011. The manuscript was accepted by Red Ink Literary Agency and subsequently underwent another round of editing. Nayak received publishing offers from Rupa & Co. and Amaryllis and he eventually signed the deal with Amaryllis in 2012. The book was first released at the New Delhi World Book Fair in February 2014. Themes Satyarth Nayak with Shobha De at Bangalore Lit Fest 2014 The human quest for answers is the central theme of the book. The characters are on a personal quest and the final destination may or may not be as per their expectations. More than the answers, it's the pursuit itself that matters. Where one ends, another begins. The riddles in the thriller based on Indian history and mythology also become successively complicated and difficult to heighten the mystery. They also symbolize the everlasting human quest for truth. Buddhism plays an important role in the book. This is probably one of the first Indian thrillers to predominantly use Buddhist mythology, philosophy and iconography. Structurally the book is divided into three sections titled Buddham, Dhammam and Sangham based on the concept of Triratna. Ancient science and technology is also a crucial theme. The book explores the great scientific advancement made in Ancient India investigating the technological literature and artifacts believed to be far more futuristic than present day gizmos. The Book Geeks review states that \\"Satyarth Nayak has taken our rich ancient knowledge of science and converted it into a historical fiction\\". Reception The Emperor's Riddles was met with a positive response. The book earned acclaim from other mystery writers, with Amish Tripathi calling it \\"a fantastic blend of myth, imagination and mystery\\", and Ashwin Sanghi describing it as \\"Intelligent, Intriguing, Imaginative, Intense\\". While Times of India called it a \\"history meets mystery\\", Hindustan Times called it \\"a gripping tale of intrigue\\" and lauded the book for its \\"taut narration and interesting climax\\". HT Brunch magazine included the book in its Summer Reading List of 2014, calling it \\"a celebration of our great Indian civilisation and its scientific genius\\" and recommending it for those who like \\"riddles and cool mythological references\\". Yahoo praised the book as an \\"extraordinary tale of riddles\\". The Hindu described it as a \\"concoction of mystery, thriller, legend\\" and a \\"national bestseller\\" while The Pioneer lauded how \\"history is being explored by the new-age writers like never before\\". The New Indian Express declared the thriller \\"a hit with young readers\\" and said it \\"opened a completely different avenue for budding writers to experiment with\\". While English Vinglish director Gauri Shinde called the book \\"an acclaimed thriller\\" via Twitter, the SpectralHues book review said the thriller's \\"shock twist towards the end makes you feel so ignorant\\" and that \\"a Christopher Nolan of the West or our very own Anurag Kashyap can pretty well give it a thought to bring The Emperor‚Äôs Riddles to life on screen\\". Comparisons with Dan Brown Since its release, The Emperor's Riddles has been likened to the mystery novels of Dan Brown. In an interview with Times of India, Nayak stated that \\"the fact that the book's earning comparisons with Dan Brown is overwhelming\\" and \\"If Brown has codes, my book has riddles.\\" Film adaptation The novel has received an interest from a Bollywood scriptwriter to convert it into a film. Nayak has stated that he will also be collaborating on the screenplay.

In late 1964 he was a co-founder of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, an armed black self-defense group, in the small industrial mill town of Jonesboro, Louisiana, to protect the black community against white violence. Together with Earnest \\"Chilly Willy\\" Thomas, Kirkpatrick also founded Deacons chapters in other cities of Louisiana, and in Mississippi and Alabama. An associate of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Kirkpatrick was a singer/songwriter, serving as director of folk culture. Beginning in 1968, he recorded three albums with Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. One was a recording of the 1978 Louisiana Folk Fest, an annual event which Kirkpatrick had conceived and regularly hosted, to preserve and celebrate musical culture. He used music to teach African-American history, including the Civil Rights Movement, to schoolchildren. Later in life he settled in New York City. Biography Named after the renowned 19th-century abolitionist Frederick Douglass, Kirkpatrick was born in 1933 in Haynesville, northern Louisiana. His father John L. Kirkpatrick was a minister and his mother died young. He had four sisters and a brother who survived to adulthood. They attended the local segregated schools and church, growing up steeped in gospel and spiritual music. Kirkpatrick learned to play the guitar and sing, and began to compose his own music. His parents encouraged his education and he graduated from Grambling College (now Grambling University), a historically black college, with a degree in biology. Kirkpatrick became a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which formed in the 1950s to work for civil rights of African Americans by gathering together the power of their churches. He ultimately served as director of folk culture for the SCLC. He continued to sing, play the guitar and write his own music. Among his best-known songs was his version of Pete Seeger's \\"Everybody's Got a Right to Live\\", described as \\"an anthem of the civil rights movement.\\" Resistance to the civil rights movement was violent in many areas of the South, including in the industrial mill towns of northern Louisiana. By the early 1960s, Kirkpatrick was living and working in Jonesboro, Louisiana, a small industrial mill town in the northern part of the state, where CORE members had also been working for civil rights gains. Faced with continued violence from KKK members, in November 1964 Kirkpatrick and Earnest \\"Chilly Willy\\" Thomas co-founded the Deacons for Defense and Justice in the town in Jackson Parish. The minority of black workers had been in class conflict with whites for years, in addition to struggling with oppression under the state's Jim Crow laws.Seth Hague, \\" 'Niggers Ain‚Äôt Gonna Run This Town': Militancy, Conflict and the Sustenance of the Hegemony in Bogalusa, Louisiana\\", Outstanding History Paper (1997-1998), Loyola University-New Orleans; accessed 11 May 2017 They met challenges in a different way than rural blacks in agricultural areas, demanding that CORE follow their lead. As black workers sought civil rights in Jonesboro, they had come under intimidation and attack by members of the local Ku Klux Klan (KKK) chapter. Kirkpatrick and Thomas formed the Deacons for Defense and Justice as an armed group to protect civil rights workers, their families and the black community. That same year, Kirkpatrick was ordained as a minister in the Church of God and Christ in Jonesboro. This was founded in the late 19th century as a small Protestant fundamentalist sect based in Lexington, Mississippi. As it embraced the holiness movement, it grew considerably in the post-World War II years, establishing congregations throughout the South, and following the Great Migration of African Americans to the North to establish congregations in major cities there. It is now a global church with a membership of millions. During 1965, Kirkpatrick and Thomas founded Deacons chapters in other cities of Louisiana. In February 1965 they traveled 300 miles to the small mill town of Bogalusa, Louisiana, where black workers were similarly motivated to defend themselves. They also set up Deacons chapters in other towns, and in Mississippi and Alabama as well, where many blacks had also been victimized by white vigilantes. Armed defense had been increasingly a part of black strategy since 1960 in such cities as Clarksdale and Natchez, Mississippi, and in rural areas of the state, even among NAACP leaders. They kept guns in their homes to guard against attacks.Annelieke Dirks, \\"Between Threat and Reality: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Emergence of Armed Self-Defense in Clarksdale and Natchez, Mississippi, 1960-1965\\", Journal for the Study of Radicalism 1.1 (2007), pp. 71-98; accessed via Project MUSE, 11 May 2017 Musician In 1968, soon after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Kirkpatrick recorded an album with Jimmy Collier, Everybody's Got a Right to Live, for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.Everybody's Got a Right to Live 1968, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings; accessed 11 May 2017 The collection of songs from the civil rights era is also available by download, cassette, or CD. In 1969 Kirkpatrick was featured on Alessandro Portelli's L'America Della Contestazione (I Dischi del Sole) singing \\"Bourgeois School\\", a rewrite of Lead Belly's \\"Bourgeois Blues\\". Brother Kirkpatrick sang \\"Bring 'Em Home\\" and \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" on stage with Pete Seeger at the enormous anti-Vietnam War march and rally on November 15, 1969 in Washington, DC, inspiring an audience of more than half a million people. In 1972, Kirkpatrick recorded Ballads of Black America (FW07751), as lead singer and guitar, with Pete Seeger, playing banjo, and Jeanne Humphries on bass. This was also for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.Ballads of Black America, 1972, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings He wrote and composed the songs about leading figures of black history, after learning at a 1969 performance in a Brooklyn school, that black children had few books and music that taught about the contributions of their people to the United States and the world. Kirkpatrick's ballads honor seven leaders, including Harriet Tubman, Paul Robeson, and Martin Luther King Jr., and the Deacons for Defense and Justice. Known as Reverend Douglass Kirkpatrick, he continued to write and perform songs, accompanying himself on guitar. In 1975 he performed his song \\"The Ballad of Frank Wills\\" on WNYC. It was about the break-in at Watergate and ultimate resignation of President Richard M. Nixon, from the perspective of the security guard who found the first evidence. This was part of Kirkpatrick's full performance on Dave Sear's Folk and Baroque radio program, WNYC, which aired January 1, 1975.John Passmore, \\"Ballad of a Watergate Security Guard\\", 9 August 2015, NYPR Archives and Preservation; link to recording of full performance; accessed 11 May 2017 Kirkpatrick founded and hosted the Louisiana Folk Fest, to pull communities and families together and preserve their music.

As a professor of American literature at the Pennsylvania State University, Pattee wrote the lyrics of the Penn State Alma Mater. Pattee is sometimes labeled the \\"first Professor of American Literature\\", a position he held at Penn State from 1895 until 1928. Biography Fred Lewis Pattee was born on March 22, 1863, in Bristol, New Hampshire, to farmer Lewis Franklin Pattee and Mary Philbrick Pattee (n√©e Ingalls). After attending public schools in Bristol and South Alexandria, New Hampshire, in 1881 he entered New Hampton School and completed the college preparatory course in 1884. Pattee enrolled at Dartmouth College, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1888 and a Master of Arts degree in 1891. Despite an interest in becoming a journalist, Pattee entered the teaching profession, first at a New Jersey grammar school. He worked as a school administrator and journalist until becoming an interim faculty member at the Pennsylvania State College's English Department as a substitute for the department's head and sole professor in 1894. He earned a full professorship the following year. While a professor at the Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University), Pattee wrote the lyrics to what is now the Penn State Alma Mater in April 1901 and had them published. Former Pennsylvania Governor and then- President of the Board of Trustees James A. Beaver declared the tune would be Penn State College's official song after it was sung at an alumni dinner in 1901. With Penn State President George W. Atherton's consent, a four-verse version of Pattee's originally six-verse lyrics were adopted as the Penn State Alma Mater. As an American literary historian, Pattee's earliest predecessor was John Neal, whose essays in Blackwood's Magazine he collected and published in 1937 in their first bound edition, American Writers: A Series of Papers Contributed to Blackwood's Magazine (1824-1825). He acknowledged Neal's work as ‚Äúthe first attempt anywhere at a history of American literature.‚Äù In his later career, Pattee served as a visiting professor at his alma mater, Dartmouth College (1905), as well as the University of Illinois, Bread Loaf Summer School and Columbia University. Following his retirement from his post as Penn State's Professor of American Literature, Pattee joined the faculty of Rollins College in Florida. He would remain there until his death at age 87 in Winter Park, Florida, on May 6, 1950. Pattee was married twice, to Anna Lura Plumer and Grace Gorrell Garee, and had one daughter‚ÄîSarah Lewis Patee‚Äîfrom his first marriage.

The building was used to house electric railway cars, first for the Redlands Central Railway and later for the Pacific Electric Railway. It is the only extant Pacific Electric car barn, and one of only two trolley barns remaining in Southern California. . History The Redlands Central Railway was formed in 1907 by Henry and John H. Fisher, and its car barn was built the same year; it served a line along Citrus and Brookside Avenues in Redlands. The company merged with the San Bernardino Valley Traction Company (SBVT) in 1908, and its car barn became a secondary barn for the consolidated system. In 1911, the SBVT merged into the Pacific Electric (PE) Railway, Southern California's sprawling electric streetcar network. The car barn was used intermittently by the Pacific Electric for the next two decades; Pacific Electric's Redlands service mainly used the larger SBVT barn. In 1926, the barn was officially no longer being used. It went out of service when the Citrus and Brookside Avenue line was converted to bus service. PE and its successors leased the barn to various businesses until its sale in 1987. The city of Redlands purchased the barn to save it from demolition, but could not afford renovations. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 3, 1991. In 1994, the barn was sold by the city.

He has been called the \\"father of Rhode Island art\\" and the \\"father of art in Providence.\\" His works include eleven portraits of governors of Rhode Island, displayed at the State House, and six portraits of mayors which hang in the Providence City Hall. Early life James Sullivan Lincoln was born in Taunton, Massachusetts, to Sullivan and Keziah (Weston) Lincoln. He was the oldest of six children. His father was a miller and farmer. At age ten, the family moved to Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln's father died when James was fourteen. Needing to earn money to support the family, James went to work for an engraving company in downtown Providence. Lincoln's job was to make the drawings for the engravings; his skill at drawing caught the attention of nearby artist C.T. Hinckley, who trained the boy in the art of painting. Within two years, James was able to copy famous paintings such as Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington, which hung in the Rhode Island State House. Painting career His painting career began in 1832. One of Lincoln's earliest clients (when he was age 25) was wealthy Pawtucket industrialist Samuel Slater, who had been dissatisfied with an earlier portrait by another painter. Lincoln's portrait proved so popular that he made several copies, including one for Brown University (deaccessioned in 1980). Lincoln's mentor Hinckley moved away from Providence, leaving the field open for his protege to open his own studio on South Main Street, in the heart of the city at Market Square. He ran this studio for sixty years, soon becoming the pre-eminent portrait painter in Rhode Island. In 1880, Lincoln was elected first president of the Providence Art Club. Personal life Lincoln married Rosina Child Chase, daughter of Darius and Elizabeth Chase. Rosina's parents moved from Providence to a farm in Barrington, Rhode Island shortly after the marriage, and for a time the young couple lived there with the Chases, with James commuting daily from Barrington to his Providence studio. In 1863 the Lincolns moved into the city of Providence. He enjoyed traveling around the state of Rhode Island, to pursue his pastime of trout fishing. He had a great love of nature, which sometimes worked its way into the backgrounds of his paintings. From about 1832 to 1856, Lincoln was a member of the Providence National Cadets, an \\"independent military organization\\". For two years he was a member of the Rhode Island Militia. He did not serve in the Civil War, but was active in training recruits during 1861 and 1862. Lincoln died in 1888 and is buried at Swan Point Cemetery. Awards and honors * In 2004, Lincoln was posthumously inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame. Gallery Lincoln painted eleven portraits of governors which hang in the Rhode Island State House, six portraits of mayors which hang in the Providence City Hall, plus numerous judges, lawyers, clergy, physicians, professors, industrialists, and others.

He served as Mayor of Rapid City, South Dakota from 2011 to 2015. Early life Kooiker was born on March 9, 1974 in Japan, while his father John Kooiker taught at the Christian Academy. The family returned to the United States in 1975, where young Kooiker and three siblings grew up on the family farm in Boyden, Iowa. He attended Western Christian High School in the neighboring town of Hull. Alt URL While in high school, Kooiker held a job at Hy-Vee's Sheldon and Sioux Center stores. He earned bachelor's degrees in criminal justice and psychology and a master's degree in public administration from the University of South Dakota. During his time at USD, Kooiker continued working for Hy-Vee in Vermillion, South Dakota, and was also an intern at the Sioux City Police Department in his home state of Iowa. Kooiker and his wife moved to Rapid City in the summer of 1999, where he worked at Gateway Computers for eight years; at the South Dakota Division of Vocational Rehabilitation for about a year; and at Golden West Technologies for six years. In 2015, Kooiker's father was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives. Political career Argus Leader political columnist David Montgomery described Rapid City as an overwhelmingly Republican town where local politics is hotly contested between factions within the Republican Party that Montgomery terms the \\"Establishment Party\\" and the \\"Outsider Party.\\" Montgomery characterized Kooiker as \\"the most successful representative\\" of the more \\"populist\\" outsider faction. Kooiker was named to the Rapid City Planning Commission by then-mayor Jerry Munson in 2001, and served until 2002. He was elected to the Rapid City Common Council later that year and represented Ward 2 until he was elected mayor. As a city council member, Kooiker gained a reputation for being detail-orientated, especially on budget issues. While serving on the council, he was censured twice, privately in 2005 and publicly in 2010. The 2010 censure was the first public rebuke of an elected official in Rapid City history. Kooiker had defeated Alan Hanks and incumbent Jim Shaw in the first mayoral election of 2007, but a runoff three weeks later was won by Hanks. The next year, Kooiker applied for the position of city administrator in Cherokee, Iowa, but did not get the job, which instead went to Don Eikmeier. He stayed in Rapid City, and decided to run for mayor again in 2011. Kooiker began his campaign with heavy use of social media, primarily Facebook, and was elected mayor that year by \\"a wave of overwhelming support in some of the city's poorer precincts,\\" defeating Hanks by 478 votes. Kooiker took office on July 5, 2011. He ran for reelection in 2013, against state senator Mark Kirkeby. Amid allegations of micromanagement, Kooiker defeated Kirkeby, by 4,702 votes. In 2014, Kooiker appointed Lt. Elias Diaz, an officer of Native American and Hispanic heritage, as chief of police. When the appointment met with opposition in the city council, Kooiker appointed Karl Jegaris instead. Improving relations between Rapid City's white majority and its Indian and Black citizens was a major focus of Kooiker's administration. Kooiker lost his bid for a third term in June 2015, as former Rapid City police chief Steve Allender won the election by 1,226 votes. Kooiker's second mayoral term ended on July 6, 2015. Cherokee, Iowa mayor Mark Murphy announced Kooiker's hiring as city administrator in October 2015. Kooiker was sworn in on December 22, 2015, though he had begun work earlier that month. In 2017, governor Kim Reynolds named Kooiker to the Iowa Civil Rights Commission. Kooiker was offered the city manager position in Sheldon, Iowa, in October 2018. Sheldon's city council voted to approve the hiring of Kooiker later that month, and he assumed the office in December 2018. Personal Kooiker married the former Jennifer King in 1999, whose family owned King‚Äôs Grocery/Pasties in Lead, South Dakota from 1959 to 2000. They are the parents of three daughters, Abbie, Aubrie and Ellie. Kooiker has cerebral palsy.

Bosnia and Herzegovina  The Islamic Declaration by Alija Izetbegoviƒá (1925‚Äì2003) published in 1970, is an essay on Islam and modernization. In 1983, 13 Muslim intellectuals were sentenced to prison on charges of Islamic fundamentalism. The Party of Democratic Action (SDA), founded in 1990 and led by Izetbegoviƒá won the November 1990 elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the Bosnian War, Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) received financial aid from Iran and Saudi Arabia, and foreign fighters numbering up to 400 waged jihad in the war. There were several strict Muslim special units in the ARBiH, such as the 7th Muslim Brigade, Black Swans, Green Berets, Green Legion, El Mujahid, and Patriotic League. The Bosnian mujahideen (El Mujahid) was made up of foreign fighters and radical Bosniaks. In 1995, Izetbegoviƒá invited the jihadists to leave the country in return for American peacekeepers, leading to his denouncement from other Islamists. *1997 Mostar car bombing, organized by Ahmed Zuhair (Abu Handala), a Saudi mujahideen that fought in Bosnia. Handala was later arrested and detained in 2007 at Guantanamo. *On 19 October 2005 Bosnian‚ÄìSwedish Mirsad Bekta≈°eviƒá was arrested during a police raid Sarajevo, together with a Danish citizen. A home-made suicide belt, of factory-made explosives, timing devices, detonators and a Hi-8 videotape with footage demonstrating how to make a home-made bomb were found. A video (to be published following planned attacks) of the two arrested, in ski masks, surrounded by explosives and weapons, was found, in which they say that they will attack sites in Europe to punish nations with forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. They were suspected of planning a suicide attack against a Western embassy in Sarajevo. *27 June 2010 terrorist attack on Bugojno police station, in which IEDs exploded by the guard walls, killing one, seriously wounding one, and wounding several other policemen. The perpetrator Haris ƒåau≈°eviƒá, an ethnic Bosniak, was sentenced to 35 years. He has stated that he has no remorse. *Mevlid Ja≈°areviƒá, a 23-year-old Serbian- born Bosnian, fired on the U.S. embassy in Sarajevo on 28 October 2011, resulting in one local policeman guarding the embassy being wounded in the arm, while the shooter was wounded by a police sniper. On 24 April 2012 Ja≈°areviƒá was indicted by a federal grand jury in the D.C. on charges of attempted murder and other violations in connection with the attack on the embassy. A Bosnian court sentenced him on 6 December 2012 to 18 years in prison. *Husein Bosniƒá \\"Bilal\\", a Bosnian Muslim cleric and unofficial leader of the Salafist movement in Bosnia, was arrested in September 2014 and is currently on trial for recruiting ISIS fighters. In his various khutbas, he also advocated the \\"victory of Islam\\", promoting war and bloodshed. Moreover, in 2012 he called for other Muslims to join the Jihad and to defend Islam, for which he was briefly arrested and soon released. * Operation Ruben  Bulgaria  The Iztok neighbourhood of Pazardzhik, inhabited by Muslims (Romani), includes an Islamist community headed by unlicensed imam Ahmed Moussa.  Kosovo  Kosovo has a mainly secular Muslim population part of a cultural remainder from the Ottoman era. The traditional Islam in Kosovo is the Hanafi school, described as 'liberal' and 'moderate'. Islamist volunteers in the Kosovo Liberation Army from Western Europe of ethnic Albanian, Turkish, and North African origin, were recruited by Islamist leaders in Western Europe allied to Bin Laden and Zawahiri. Some 175 Yemeni mujahideen arrived in early May 1998. There were also a dozen of Saudi and Egyptian mujahideen. Since the Kosovo War, there has been an increasing radicalization of Islam in Kosovo. Wahhabism, which is dominant in Saudi Arabia, has gained a foothold in Kosovo through Saudi diplomacy. Saudi money has paid for new mosques, while Saudi- educated imams have arrived since the end of the war in 1999. During UN administration, Saudi Arabian organizations sought to establish a cultural foothold in Kosovo. 98 Wahhabist schools were set up by Saudi organizations during UN administration. The Kosovo Police arrested some 40 suspected Islamist militants on 11 August 2014. These were suspected of having fought with Islamist insurgent groups in Syria and Iraq. By April 2015, a total of 232 Kosovo Albanians had gone to Syria to fight with Islamist groups, most commonly the Islamic State. Forty of these are from the town of Sk√´nderaj (Srbica), according to Kosovo police reports. As of September 2014, a total of 48 ethnic Albanians have been killed fighting in Syria. The number of fighters from Kosovo is at least 232 and estimated at more than 300 (as of 11 February 2016). A 2017 UNDP study shows that Islamic extremism has grown in Kosovo. Croatia *1995 Rijeka bombing Groups Groups of ethnic Albanians were arrested by police in November 2016 in Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia for planning terrorist attacks. They were coordinated by IS commanders Lavdrim Muhaxheri and Ridvan Haqifi, both Kosovo Albanians, and planned attacks on international and state institutions, ultimately with the intent to establish an Islamic state. They planned to attack the Israeli football team during a match in Albania, and potentially Kosovo government institutions and Serbian Orthodox Church sites. A group of ethnic Albanians, Kosovo-born immigrants to Italy, were arrested by Italian police in Venice on 30 March 2017 for planning blowing up the Rialto Bridge.

Despite receiving moderate airplay from commercial radio in the United Kingdom, the single was not added to Radio 1's playlist, leading to accusations of ageism. The controversy stemmed from an article in the Daily Mail, which quoted an unnamed Radio 1 insider describing Madonna as \\"old\\" and \\"irrelevant\\". In response, the singer's fans posted numerous requests for the song on BBC's social media accounts, and several artists criticized Radio 1's music policy, prompting the station to release a statement defending their decision not to play the track. The controversy received significant media coverage in the UK and internationally, sparking a wider discussion about ageism in the music industry. \\"Living for Love\\" was subsequently added to BBC Radio 2's C-list, before being promoted to the B-list. The station targets audiences aged 35 and higher. Commercially, the single peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending 28 February 2015. Background Radio 1's alt=Scott Mills sitting at a radio station desk. Madonna has received considerable airplay on BBC Radio 1 since the beginning of her career and made her first appearance on the station on 22 December 1986, when she was interviewed by Simon Bates during the promotion of the film Shanghai Surprise. The singer gave subsequent interviews to Jakki Brambles, Bates, Simon Mayo, Sara Cox, Jo Whiley, and Chris Moyles in 1990, 1991, 1994, 2000, 2001, and 2006, respectively. The station also broadcast the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990 and The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. On 10 May 2008, Madonna headlined BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend at Mote Park, in Maidstone to promote the release of her album Hard Candy. The first single from the album, \\"4 Minutes\\" (2008), was added to the station's A-list. In 2012, Madonna released her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The lead single, \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\", and subsequent releases from the album were not added to the Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, \\"I don't think we play Madonna any more. There is a lot of research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [She's] probably not at the top of their list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that.\\" Speaking at a Radio Academy event in 2014, the station's Head of Music, George Ergatoudis, stated that its audience had \\"moved on\\" from Madonna, and that the majority of her fans were \\"over 30\\". He added that the BBC Trust had decided to make Radio 1 as a station appealing to a younger demographic, a factor which determines their daytime playlists. Events alt=Diplo playing at his DJ booth. On 20 December 2014, Madonna's thirteenth studio album Rebel Heart became available for pre-order. Unlike other countries, first single \\"Living for Love\\" was only made available for pre-order in the United Kingdom, and was not chart-eligible until 25 February 2015. On 22 December 2014, \\"Living for Love\\" started to receive airplay on commercial radio, most notably Capital FM, where the song was eventually added to the station's playlist. On 9 January 2015, Annie Mac played \\"Living for Love\\" on Radio 1 during her evening dance show. In a later interview with The Independent, Mac said that her mission was to \\"represent the landscape of new music honestly\\", and hoped that older artists such as Madonna should not get excluded from the station. \\"I'm a lifelong Madonna fan and I played her on my Friday show. [...] If I'm excited by a song, then I think it's going to be all right to play it\\", Mac concluded. An article published by the Daily Mail on 14 February 2015 quoted an unnamed BBC Radio 1 insider who stated that \\"Living for Love\\" would not be played on the station because Madonna is \\"irrelevant\\" and \\"old\\". Radio 1 later denied the claims on their Facebook page, stating that the station \\"does not ban anyone\\". One of its representatives explained that tracks are chosen on \\"musical merit\\" and that an artist's age is never a factor when choosing songs for their playlist. Reception The Daily Mail article quickly went viral, and hundreds of messages were left on Radio 1's Facebook page from Madonna's fans urging the station to play \\"Living for Love\\". Support for the singer soon spread to the station's Twitter and Instagram accounts, with fans posting links to the \\"Living for Love\\" video, her performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, and posts claiming that the BBC was being discriminatory. Madonna received support from artists such as Boy George, Elly Jackson, Diplo and Rita Ora. Shirley Manson wrote on her Twitter account that Madonna should \\"contemplate suing Radio 1 for discrimination in the workplace\\", and that the station's music policy was \\"bordering on, if not actively, unlawful\\". Madonna posted a newspaper clipping that featured the story on her Twitter and Instagram accounts, and thanked her fans for their support. She also recalled discussing the incident with her manager Guy Oseary and admitted that it was perplexing for her to learn that artists in their fifties do not get played on radio, without exceptions. \\"We've made so many advances in other areas ‚Äî civil rights, gay rights ‚Äî but ageism is still an area that's taboo and not talked about and dealt with,\\" she concluded. BBC rebuttal and aftermath The BBC was quick to refute allegations of ageism, and explained that songs were chosen on a case-by-case basis for inclusion on their weekly playlist. Their representative noted that Paul McCartney had two songs on the playlist, although critics pointed out that both of these tracks were collaborations with younger artists (McCartney featured on \\"Only One\\", with Kanye West, and \\"FourFiveSeconds\\", with Rihanna). The station further listed David Guetta, the Foo Fighters, and Sia as examples of older artists making their playlist. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Radio 1's controller Ben Cooper explained that the station has not \\"banned\\" Madonna, and that a group of twelve 16‚Äì24 aged personnel would meet on a regular basis to review the network's musical output, determining the relevant musical choice for their demographic. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Mills defended the station's decision not to play the song. He stated, \\"[Radio 1 are] trying to get the average age of the listener down and, to be honest, most Madonna fans are in their 30s and 40s. I don't actually mind the new single, but do I think Radio 1 should play it? Probably not.\\" According to the Official Charts Company, \\"Living for Love\\" moved towards the top-twenty of the UK Singles Chart with two days of available sales as reported in their mid-week chart report. It ultimately debuted at number 26 on the chart with sales of 17,936 copies, becoming Madonna's 71st top-forty single, extending her record as the female artist with the most top-forty UK singles.

Biography  The band was started by the four musicians who originally was backing band for songwriter and singer Eduardo ¬´Doddo¬ª Andersen in his project Unge Frustrerte Menn. They were Geir Luedy (vocals and brother of Eduardo), Paal Andersen (keyboards, not brother of Eduardo), Frode Unneland (drums, vocals) and Even Johansen (guitar) later known as Magnet. The band lineup was finally completed when bassist and producer Bj√∏rn Ivar Tysse joined in. He had previously played with Luedy in the band Forbidden Colours. Luedy was former bassist in the band MonaLisa Overdrive, later known as Barbie Bones, while Unneland and Tysse had been rhythm section in The Rub and Pompel and the Pilts. Johansen and Andersen also had experience within various Bergen bands. Chocolate Overdose was a part of the so-called Bergen Wave early 1990s. The band got a record contract with Warner Music, and made their international debut at the Glastonbury Festival 1992. This was the first time a Norwegian played at this festival, in front of 15.000 spectators, and Ole-Petter Dronen organized it all for them. Their debut album Everybody Likes Chocolate (1992) was no great success, and Warner connected the band with Swedish star producer Michael Ihlbert, and the second album Sugar Baby became more of a success, as an open and accessible record, with guest performances by artists like Sonya Aurora Madan of Echobelly, PapaDee and Geir Sundst√∏l. The great sales failed, and Chocolate Overdose was suspended from the contract with Warner. Johansen then moved to London, where he initiated the band Libido. He was replaced by the guitarist Mats Gr√∏nner, and the band went on as Unge Frustrerte Menn. At this poit Unneland joined in the band Savoy. Chocolate Overdose managed to record two full albums with Doddo before releasing something on their own. Whatever was first released in the United States and Canada in 1997 on the label Bar None, while the Norwegian fans had to wait until the spring of 1998, when a contract with Rune Grammofon was signed. The next album was produced by the band, and included guest musicians like Hildegunn Solb√∏ (vocals), Per J√∏rgensen (trumpet) and Stein Inge Br√¶khus (drums). The fourth album Dingledoodies, was released the year after, and stood out as the most complete album style-wise. Anders Marius Bortne collaborated as co-vocalist on the track ¬´Lou and Lee¬ª.

Along intellectual work, he involved in politics for a short time following the Jasmine revolution. However, by the time he resigned, he declared his intention to step out of political work for good and count on writing to incite social change. A central theme of Marzouki's thought is reconciling, or even unifying, philosophy and religion. According to him, ending the conflict between philosophy and religion (or Islam in particular), which he believes is an ancient one, is the only possible way to bring about actual reform in the Islamic world in particular, and the world in general. To achieve the \\"civilizational revival of the Islamic nation, he argues, Muslim nations must overcome the ideas of Arabic Renaissance so that they can resume what he calls their current civilizational mission in the context of globalization, holding that \\"without strong and independent economies and serious ethics of work, social growth may remain a wishful thinking\\". Early life and education He was born in Ferryville, French Protectorate of Tunisia. The thirteenth in a family of fifteen children, he obtained a philosophy degree at the Sorbonne University in 1972. He taught at the University of Tunis between 1980 and 2006 and at the International Islamic University of Malaysia. Political career He was elected to the Constituent Assembly as a representative of the Islamist party Ennahda for the district of Tunis on 23 October 2011, and was subsequently appointed advisor, with cabinet rank, to the Culture and the Education ministers. He later resigned from the assembly on 6 March 2013, and returned to teaching philosophy. Upon retirement, he left a bitter note to conclude his experience in which he accused Ennahda, then-governing party, of nepotism and exploiting power as if it were a \\"spoil of war\\".

She was considered one of the finest coloratura sopranos of her generation and was often compared with Mercedes Capsir and Toti dal Monte. Her best roles included Rosina in Gioacchino Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia and Gilda in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto. Nun√π Sanchioni was born in Cairo to the family of an Italian consul in Egypt. In her youth she moved to Italy and probably settled in Milan, where she studied singing with Emma Molajoli, the wife of the famous conductor Lorenzo Molajoli. She made her debut as Musetta in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me at the Teatro Campoamor in Oviedo in 1926. From 1926 to 1932 she appeared with great success in Italian provincial opera houses, but in 1931 and 1932 she sang Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia, Gilda in Rigoletto and H√§nsel in Engelbert Humperdinck's H√§nsel und Gretel at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. In 1932 Sanchioni was struck with an illness which led to her withdrawal from the stage for two years. After her recovery in 1934 she was engaged for the season at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan where she sang with sensational success the role of Adele in Johann Strauss's operetta Die Fledermaus in the production of Max Reinhardt. Towards the end of the 1930s Nun√π Sanchioni married a German citizen and moved to Java, where she performed as a concert singer. She returned to Italy in 1946 and kept singing till 1948. Little is known about her life after the 1940s, though it is notable that in 1957 and 1971 she got filmed in two minor Italian movies (Il sole torner√† and Il cavaliere inesistente). Nun√π Sanchioni made thirteen recordings for Cigale Records and Columbia Records in the 1930s. They include three duets from Rigoletto with the great baritone Apollo Granforte and three duets from Rigoletto and Il barbiere di Siviglia with Enrico Molinari, as well as some solo arias (including Juliette's Waltz from Charles Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette).

History  Luther wrote the hymn for Pentecost as a paraphrase of the Latin in his effort to establish German equivalents to the Latin parts of the liturgy. He derived the melody from the chant of the Latin hymn. The hymn in seven stanzas was first published in 1524, both in the Erfurt Enchiridion and in a setting by Johann Walter in Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn. The number in the current Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch (EG) is 126.

It is the most important national holiday in the country, and is considered to be the North Korean equivalent of Christmas. Kim's birthday, which had been an official holiday since 1968, was renamed Day of the Sun in 1997, three years after his death. The name takes its significance from his name; Il-sung is Korean for \\"become the Sun\\". North Koreans commemorate the holiday by visiting locations that have a connection with the leader's life, such as thousands of statues scattered across the country, or Mangyongdae, his birthplace in the capital Pyongyang. The most important observances take place in the capital, including visits to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where Kim Il-sung's body lies in rest, and the Mansudae Grand Monument, which features a very tall statue of the leader. The state seeks to provide its citizens with more food and electricity than is normally available, although is not always achieved. Children, in particular, receive candy and other gifts attributed to the love shown by the leaders. Festivities are not confined to the specific date. Commemorations occur from 16 February, which is the birthday of Kim Jong-il, during what is known as the Loyalty Festival. Celebrations in April around the Day of the Sun are called the Sun Festival. The day itself is followed by two days of rest, making it a three-day holiday. Background Birthplace of Kim Il-sung in Mangyongdae Kim Il-sung was born on 15 April 1912 in the village of Mangyongdae, which is now a suburb of North Korea's capital Pyongyang. He has been long identified with the Sun and is frequently called \\"Sun of the nation\\". He adopted his name Il-sung (), meaning \\"become the Sun\\" before the early 1930s as one of his noms de guerre. History Kim Il-sung's birthday had been designated as a provisional holiday in 1962. It became official in 1968, the year that saw great expansion of his cult of personality in the aftermath of a domestic political crisis known as the Kapsan Faction Incident. In 1974, the day was promoted the most important holiday of the country. It was designated as \\"The Day of the Sun\\" on 8 July 1997, the third anniversary of the death of Kim Il-sung, in a resolution by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Central Military Commission, the National Defence Commission, the and the Administration Council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. On the same occasion, North Korea adopted the Juche calendar which begins on the year of Kim Il-sung's birth. The purpose of the Day of the Sun was to celebrate \\"the greatest festival for the Korean nation,\\" and to initiate a holiday which would be of equal importance to North Koreans as Christmas is in many other places. Every fifth and tenth anniversary is marked with more pronounced celebrations than usual. 2012 marked the centenary of the birth of Kim Il-sung. On the Day of the Sun that year, current leader Kim Jong-un gave his first public speech. Massive military parades are held on the Day of the Sun and the country's most advanced weapons are displayed. In 2012 North Korea conducted a failed missile test and the new KN-08 missile was introduced in a parade. In 2020, Kim Jong- un was absent from Day of the Sun celebrations, sparking speculation about his health. Celebration Arirang Festival mass-games were often held on the Day of the Sun until 2013. Chos≈èn-ot (hanbok) for dancing folk dances on the Day of the Sun. Preparations take more than a month. Through April there are exhibitions, fireworks, song and dance events, athletics competitions, Juche idea seminars and visits to places connected with Kim Il-sung's life, including his birthplace in Mangyongdae. Some of these events take several days. Foreign art groups and dignitaries are invited to visit North Korea during this time around the day itself known as Sun Festival. The annual Kimilsungia Festival (held since 1998) and the (since 1982) are also held at around the time of the Day of the Sun. The latter typically features foreign performers from some 20 countries whose televised performances are an anticipated and well-liked rare glimpse of foreign culture for North Koreans. It also includes the Pyongyang Marathon. As early as midnight on the morning of Day of the Sun, people lay commemorative wreaths and floral baskets at thousands of statues of Kim Il-sung around the country. The demand for flowers is huge. The market ‚Äì mostly operating informally ‚Äì is estimated to be worth 600,000‚Äì1,200,000 dollars just for the Day of the Sun. Artificial flowers are favored for their low cost. In the evening, youth dress in hanbok to participate in folk dances. The main observances take place in the capital city of Pyongyang. Flowers are laid in front of Kim Il-sung's statue on Mansu Hill. People pay respects at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun where his body lies in state. In particular, leader Kim Jong-un has paid his respects at the palace every year. Pyongyang also often hosts the Arirang Festival mass-games to coincide with the celebration of the Day of the Sun. There has been an evening fireworks display in Pyongyang since 2009 and its design has been attributed to Kim Jong-un. The state serves special foods such as meat and liquor as well as necessities to the people on the Day of the Sun to signal that all well-being is thanks to the care of the leader. The state tries to maintain a stable supply of electricity for the day to allow people to watch television, while theaters show special movies. The food situation varies. According to North Korean defector Kim Hyun-hwa: \\"The Sun Festival is one of the few occasions during which everyone can eat to their heart's content. Even those who go hungry on a regular basis usually manage to obtain three meals on this day. This is because North Korea marks it as the biggest holiday for the Korean people.\\" However, in 2015 the state reportedly failed to distribute rations and did not deliver middle-school uniforms that schoolchildren were expecting to receive. Children under the age of 12 receive bags of of candy and cookies at ceremonies at school. Upon receiving this gift, they have to bow in front of portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il in the classroom and say: \\"Thank you, the Great Leader Grandfather! And, thank you Father!\\" Schoolchildren also prepare performances well in advance. On the 11th through 12th their teachers choose the best ones for the Day of the Sun. The Day of the Sun is one of the few occasions on which the Korean Children's Union admits new members. Government and business offices, banks, and retail close for the Day of the Sun. It is also a common holiday for weddings. The Day of the Sun is followed by two days of rest, making it a three-day holiday. The day following the Day of the Sun typically features political meetings in which the Ten Principles of the ideological system are sworn allegiance for. Loyalty Festival A similar holiday exists for 16 February, the birthday of former leader Kim Jong-il, known as the Day of the Shining Star. The two-month period between the Day of the Shining Star and the Day of the Sun is known as the Loyalty Festival Period and festivities occur throughout.

It is one of the most precious Gothic structures in the country and a popular destination for holidaymakers. Description Courtyard The palatial stronghold in Lidzbark Warmi≈Ñski, which for centuries was the largest town in Warmia, is located by the estuary of the river Symsarna with the river ≈Åyna. The stronghold is encircled by a defensive moat. An additional \\"dry moat\\" encircled the local living quarters located close to the stronghold - all of the defensive structures survive except the northern-moat, where the castle's windmill was once located. The adjacent palace The castle was built on a plan of a square formation, with 48,5 metre long walls. A fourteen level tower is located in the north-east wing of the castle. The lower part of the tower, built in a square structure has posterns - while the upper part of the tower is octagonal. The other four corners of the castle have small square decorational towers, whose design changed throughout the centuries. The castle courtyard is made up of two levels - both with cloisters; these are the only historical cloisters in Poland which have not architecturally changed. The stronghold has aspects relating to the Teutonic Order, whose architectural style can be both seen in the castle's courtyard but also traced in the representative level of the castle in: the chapel; the small and big refectory; in the capitulary; common hall; and in the bishops' chambers. The castle serves as one of the main attractions of the town and regularly hosts cabaret events in the Autumn months. History The Great Refectory (refektarz) The castle was built between 1350-1401 as the seat of the Warmian bishops, later going into the hands of the Teutonic Order. The Teutonic Knights lost the castle in 1466, after the Second Peace of Toru≈Ñ - the fortress was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth up until 1795 (after the Third Partition of Poland; where behind the castle walls artistic life thrived. In 1794, Ignacy Krasicki, the last residing bishop, left the castle. His successors - bishops Karol and J√≥zef Hohenzollern - moved to Oliwa. In 1963, the castle became the premises of the Branch of the Museum of Warmia and Masuria in Olsztyn.

It is part of the Starrk√§rr-Kilanda parish in the Diocese of Gothenburg. In the churchyard is also a smaller chapel, mostly used for funerals.  History  Three churches, each succeeding the other, have been situated in the same location.  13th century ‚Äì 1721  The Medieval church was probably built during the 13th century. The stone building consisted of a long nave and a small domed choir. The church had a roof made of wood shingles and a separate bell tower. Among the few furnishings in the church was a soapstone baptismal font from the 13th century. The ceiling had paintings depicting the Virgin Mary and the Child Jesus. According to 17th-century vicar Kollinius, there were also paintings of \\"Munks and nuns kissing each other, which is offensive in a chuch\\". At the beginning of the 1700s, the church started becoming too small for the growing congregation. It was also in poor condition, but the economical situation during the time of the Great Northern War was such that a new church could not be built.  1721 ‚Äì 1842  The construction of the new church started in 1721. Cheap solutions during the building soon resulted in faults in the structure being revealed. As early as 1728, much of the interior in the new church was infested with dry rot. A decision to build a new church was made in 1765, since the old one was about to collapse. During an inspection in 1828, the members of the parish were advised to build yet another new church tower. This, being the present-day tower, was finished in 1832. After a series of renovations, the parish decided to make a more comprehensive renovation of the whole church, but were advised against this by a building inspector. He recommended that a new church should be built, only the tower was to be kept.  1842 ‚Äì  The present-day church is built in a Neoclassical style. The latest renovation and conversion was done in 2000. The church interior was repainted, the floors were sanded and oiled, the choir was extended and an interior stair to the gallery was added. A play room and facilities for the church staff were also added.  Furnishings and architecture  The original 13th-century baptismal font The pulpit in Renaissance style was made in 1682 and was remodeled in 1738. The angel hanging above the pulpit was donated to the church in 1703. The baptismal font made in 1960, by artist E. Sands was replaced in 2000, with a wooden copy of the original 13th-century font. The medieval font was donated to the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm in 1868. The font is classified by the museum as having set the tone for the Starrk√§rrsskolan (the Starrk√§rr style). A similar baptismal can be found in Vallda Church in northern Halland. Elements of the motifs on the font can also be found on the font in Str√•vall Church in Varberg. The organ has 14 stops and is made by the Magnusson Brothes in Gothenburg. An additional choir organ made by V√§stbo Orgelbyggeri, was added in 1969.

Reviewing the Saturn version, GamePros Air Hendrix remarked, \\"At first glance, PGA '97 has all the right answers: 14 PGA pros; 2 PGA courses; responsive, details controls; and a full set of modes and features.

Rob Allsetter of Sega Saturn Magazine gave it 68%, calling it \\"A decidedly lacklustre version of PGA Tour\\".

History The original embassy was built in 1962, to the designs of Eric Bedford, Chief Architect at the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works. It was ransacked on 16 September 1963 when anti-British sentiment led to attacks on both the British and Malaysian Embassies. During the attack, the assistant military attache Roderick Walker played bagpipes as a sign of defiance against the mob attack. The Embassy moved to its current location on Jl. Patra Kuningan Raya, South Jakarta in 2013 and was officially opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. The old Embassy building on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta, had increasingly become the target of protesters. In 2004, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) knocked down the building‚Äôs gate and pelted it with rotten eggs. The British government installed roadblocks at its two main access points, a move that was met with contempt from local residents.

He attended the Augusta Institute, which later became Morehouse College. Lyons graduated from the Howard University School of Law in 1884. Career Lyons was active in Republican Party politics from an early age. In 1880, Lyons was the youngest member of the Republican National Convention at the age of 20. He briefly worked in the Tresury Department before enrolling in law school. After graduating Lyons was admitted to the Georgia Bar, becoming the first African American licensed to practice law in the state. He formed a law firm in 1896 with Henry Moses Porter. Lyons was elected to represent Georgia on the Republican National Committee in 1896. After his election President William McKinley sought to appoint Lyons as the Postmaster of Augusta but was withdrawn due to objections over his race. He was then appointed Register of the Treasury in 1898 and was the second African American to hold this post. He was reappointed in 1901 after receiving support from Booker T. Washington. Lyons later fell into disfavor with Washington after Washington learned that Lyons had expressed sympathy towards William Monroe Trotter after the 1903 Boston Riots.

At the core of this three-story house is a c. 1720 late First Period house, which has been in the hands of a single family since 1758. It was home to one of York's most colorful residents of the second half of the 18th century, Nathaniel Barrell. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Barrell Homestead is located on the north side of Beech Ridge Road in south central York, a short way east of its junction with Saltwater Drive. It is a large wood frame structure, with clapboard siding. The walls rise a full two stories, and a full third floor is found under the south-facing gable roof, with an attic above. The building's corners are pilastered. The south facade is four bays wide, two windows to the left of the entrance and one to its right. There are four windows on the second level, three on the third, and one at the attic level, the upper two levels both within the gable. The entrance projects slightly, and is flanked by sidelight windows. On the west facade is a larger gable-roofed entry projection with more elaborate decoration around the door. An ell extends to the north, flush with the western wall of the main block. The oldest portion of the house is a rectangular section of the main block, two stories in height, which was built c. 1720 by Matthew Grover, who had purchased the land from one of the area's early proprietors. In 1757 Grover's son mortgaged the property to Jonathan Sayward, one of York County's wealthiest residents. He defaulted on the mortgage the following year, and Sayward foreclosed on the property. This inaugurated ownership by him and his descendants that continued at least through the property's listing on the National Register in 1976. Sayward's daughter Sally married Nathaniel Barrell in 1758, and this couple made it their home. Barrell was involved in the colonial militia, serving in the 1758 Battle of the Plains of Abraham, and was politically well-connected, serving the governor's council of the neighboring Province of New Hampshire. During a visit to England in the 1760s he came under the sway of the nonconformist religious teachings of Robert Sandeman, which had repercussions in his family, political, and business relations. His peculiar views caused a number of people to consider him a Tory, resulting in a loss of business. After he denied Jonathan Sayward access to his grandchildren, Sayward, effectively disinherited him, ensuring the passage of this property would pass through his daughter to his grandson, and that his business interests fell to another. Barrell died in 1831. The couple's oldest daughter, Sally Sayward Barrell, is acknowledged as one of Maine's first female novelists. The house saw only modest alterations until 1841, at which time its main block was enlarged to its present three-story height and roughly square footprint. The ell to the west also dates to this period.

Clorofila first came to prominence as a member of Tijuana-based music project, Nortec Collective, which collected the work of various individual producers and performers. Verdin recorded and released two solo albums under his Nortec identity Clorofila, two as Tremolo Audio, and has created music for theatre and sound design under his name. Background Jorge Verd√≠n was born in Los Angeles, but grew up in Tijuana in the 1970s and 1980s at a time when the city was still considered mainly a tourist town. Through his older brothers and sisters, he discovered The Beatles and American pop, which lead to a lifelong obsession with music, which by his teenage years, went from British rock bands Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd to British post-punk and synth-pop bands such as New Order, Cocteau Twins and Depeche Mode. This connection lead to being exposed to the record cover design from that period, which in turn, lead him to study graphic design. He studied at the design program at San Diego City College and later earned a bachelors in graphic design from the Art Center College of Design. The culture of northern Mexico has heavily influenced both Verd√≠n's music and design work. Musically, he is one of the formative forces of Nortec as a musical style, a mix of electronic dance music (sound blocks, samplings, computer manipulation, etc.), with popular northern Mexico sounds, especially norte√±o (accordion, tarola, bajo sexto) and banda (tuba, trumpet, clarinet, tarola). Clorofila is Verd√≠n's personal interpretation of that style, which differs significantly from the other members of the Nortec Collective. Verdin has stated his music is influenced by artists as varied as New Order, Donna Summer, Steve Reich and Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass. Nortec arose from Verd√≠n and the other Collective members‚Äô experience of living on the border, at the very margins of Mexican culture and in an area heavily influenced by that of the United States. He states his music tries to convey the social and political situation of northern Mexico, especially Tijuana, which is a major point for illegal immigration as well as drug trafficking. The city itself still has neighborhoods without running water, despite being only three hours away from Los Angeles and Hollywood, leading to a social political situation the artist calls ‚Äúschizophrenic.‚Äù Career Verd√≠n's musical career began under the name of Clorofila, a musical partnership he began in the late 1990s with Fritz Torres, with whom he also worked in the graphic design group Cha3. In 2002, Torres left Clorofila, leaving Verdin as the sole member. As Cha3, they worked on El sue√±o de la gallina, a local fanzine published by Cha3 along with local writers and friends, which featured design that incorporated visual ephemera and the graphic vernacular of Tijuana. The 1999-2000 issue called El Nuevo Sue√±o de la Gallina included a CD which they curated that included work by future Nortec Collective members Bostich, Hiperboreal, Fussible and the first recording by Clorofila. Through this connection, they would become part of what was initially dubbed \\"Nortec\\" a loose knit collection of musicians and artists trying to create a style based on technology and Tijuana's local culture and identity, each working with the blending of electronic dance music with the traditional musical styles of northern Mexico. The aesthetic Verdin and Torres had established with Cha3, was mixed with elements of norte√±o culture to produce visuals for self organized \\"Nortec\\" events which grew in size, until they were signed by PALM Pictures A&R; person Kim Buie, who suggested the musical projects adopt the name Nortec Collective In 2001, Tijuana Sessions Volume 1 was released under the Nortec Collective name, with design by Verdin and photography by Torres. In 2005, Tijuana Session Vol 3 was released and featured four tracks by Clorofila, as well a striking cover design by Verdin and Torres once again. It was nominated for a Latin Grammy as Best Alternative Record and Best Cover Design. One of Clorofila's songs on this album, Almada, was chosen for the video game FIFA 2005, and a track made in collaboration with Panoptica, Olvidela Compa was featured in the movie La Mujer de Mi Hermano. Years of extensive touring led to personality clashes and tensions within the group, so the members of the Collective decided in 2007 to take a hiatus from recording and touring together, during which Bostich and Fussible, unilaterally announced the break-up of the Collective. Thus led to various solo releases by its members. In 2010, Verdin released his first Clorofila solo effort called Corridos Urbanos, which had a \\"Nortec Collective Presents‚Äù tag on the artwork. but did not feature contributions from other Collective members. Clorofila worked with vocalists Fernanda Karolys, Supina Bytol and Robin Abernathy, as well as banda sinaloense ensamble Banda Agua Caliente, local Tijuana norte√±o musicians as well as a guest appearance from David J, a founding member of Bauhaus and Love and Rockets. Corridos Urbanos followed in the tradition of Nortec Collective's mix of electronic dance music and banda and norte√±o, but also displayed Verdin's interest in atmospheric electronic music, post-punk and disco. Corridos Urbanos went to number one on the Latin iTunes Electronic Music chart, despite little or no label promotion. The single Baby Rock Rock was heavily requested at alternative radio stations and made the Top 20 at Reactor FM's annual 100 Most Popular of 2010 countdown. Verdin undertook a short Mexican tour with singer Karolys and 20 piece banda sinaloense ensamble Banda Agua Caliente. The Corridos Urbanos album launch at Mexico City's Lunario del Auditorio Nacional which was nominated for the Lunas del Auditorio Nacional for Best Electronic Music Performance award. During 2012, Verdin returned to his Clorofila project and played dates around Mexico and a small tour of Europe including shows in Portugal, Spain and Belgium with a four piece of horn players from Oaxaca, dubbed Los Mezcaleros de la Sierra. Verdin released his second Clorofila solo album, Ahorita Vengo in 2014 for which he eliminated any references to Nortec in the album art, deciding it was time to move away from the label. For Ahorita Vengo, Verdin went for slightly darker, more industrial inspired sound, relying heavily on analog sequencers and synthesizers.  Theatre sound design and other music projects  In 2009, Verdin began an ongoing collaboration with Mexico City's avant-garde theater company Teatro Linea de Sombra, for whom he has created original music, songs and soundscapes for the productions Amarillo, Peque√±os Territorios en Reconstrucci√≥n, Ba√±os Roma, Revoluci√≥n and Article 13, a large scale installation performance piece in collaboration with French theatre company Carabosse for which Verdin contributed sound design, original music and conceptual support. The piece would be premiered at festivals in Europe and performed in Guanajuato, Mexico at the 2014 Festival Internacional Cervantino, for which Verd√≠n would new music for L√≠nea de Sombra's adaptation and production of Art√≠culo 13, a piece described as \\"part art installation, part memorial, and part documentary\\". In 2018 he collaborated with Teatro Linea de Sombra on Durango 66 which was presented at the Los Angeles REDCAT Theatre, as part of the Pacific Standard Time LA/LA art initiative. He has collaborated and produced remixes for Beck, Mochipet, Tremor, Matias Aguayo, Rigo Tovar and Radiokijada, both with Nortec Collective and solo. Verdin also produces music under the name Tremolo Audio, which released Visitas in 2008, a collection of semi finished tracks that were remixed by underground producers whose work he admired, including musicians from the United States, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Great Britain. In 2019, he released the follow up album, Panorama which included the finalized versions of the tracks remixed on Visitas, collaborated with Mexican composer Gabriela Ortiz on Pico-Bite-Beat, a chamber music piece for string quartet and 3 percussionists for which Verdin created electronic rhythm tracks and soundscapes.  Design work  Besides his design work for Nortec Collective and the Mil Records label, Verdin has worked as a designer and art director for MAK Center / Black Dog Publishing, Kaiser Permanente, Rebeca Mendez Communication, Nacional Records, Palm Pictures, Virgin Records, USA Networks, Razorfish, Honda, Los Angeles Magazine and currently does freelance work for various clients. His work has been published in various magazines such as Communication Arts, Time and Pulse magazines. Much of the graphic work and album covers that Verd√≠n produced for Nortec Collective with Torres, including record cover proposals, visual identity tests, concert visuals and flyers, were published in a book called El Paso del Nortec by Editorial Trilce. In 2014, Verdin designed the cover for √önicamente La Verdad, an opera by Mexican composer Gabriela Ortiz based on urban myth of Camelia La Texana from the song \\"Contrabando y Traici√≥n\\", made famous by Los Tigres del Norte. In 2015, Verdin contributed a short essay and a page design to the book \\"Seismographic Sounds ‚Äì Visions of a New World\\", a collection of essays on global music, and ethnomusicology published by Bern-based Swiss publisher, Norient Books. The following year, he worked on \\"How To Read El Pato Pascual,\\" a book and exhibit are based around reach and influence of Disney is also examined in a series of commissioned essays drawing on cultural studies, historical research and postcolonial theory for the MAK Schindler House in West Hollywood, also a part of Pacific Standard Time LA/LA.

He was an expert on employment law and workers' rights who acted for clients as diverse as Conservative Party politician Dame Shirley Porter and the trade unionist Arthur Scargill.  Early life  McMullen was born on 14 September 1948 in Blackpool, the elder of two children of John, a businessman, and Irene, a teacher. He was educated at William Hulme's Grammar School in Manchester, after which he took a degree in law at Brasenose College, Oxford, and an MSc in Industrial Relations at the London School of Economics.  Career  In 1971, McMullen became a barrister of the Middle Temple, then worked in New York until 1973. Subsequently, he worked as a trade union official for 11 years with the then General Municipal and Boilermakers' Union. When his Rights at Work was published in 1976, his advice to workers that they should organise, not sue, attracted the attention of The Times who noted his views that the people who administered the law \\"were unrepresentative, out of touch and antagonistic to workers' demands\\".\\"Lawyer tells workers: Do not sue, organize\\", The Times, 14 September 1978, p. 5. He fought for trade union recognition at the Chix bubble gum factory in Slough and during the Grunwick dispute. From 1985, he appeared in several high-profile cases, obtaining an acquittal for officers of Westminster City Council caught up in the homes for votes gerrymandering scandal. He represented Dame Shirley Porter and the miners' leader Arthur Scargill on several occasions. In 1988, he was one of the first to propose that pupil barristers should be paid while they were training by means of a levy introduced for the purpose. Historically, pupils had paid for the privilege of being trained.\\"Levy proposed to fund Bar pupils\\". The Times, 17 October 1988, p. 5. McMullen became a QC in 1994, became a circuit judge in 2001, joined the Employment Appeal Tribunal in 2002, and became a senior circuit judge in 2006, and a deputy high court judge in the Queen's Bench division in 2007. He worked as a judge at the High Court, the Employment Appeal Tribunal and Southwark Crown Court. His obituary in The Guardian called him \\"the leading expert of his generation on employment law, which he elevated to a new status\\".  Personal life  McMullen married an American, Deborah Cristman, whom he met while she was studying town planning at University College London, and they married in Connecticut in 1973 and had two children. He was a rower with the Leander Club, one of the world's oldest rowing clubs, as well as the Putney Town Rowing Club and took part in the Vogalonga regatta of Venice. McMullen was a humanist and a patron of the British Humanist Association, saying, \\"Humanism is the only rational explanation of life. It simply requires us to live compassionate lives, treating others with fairness and respect. It involves us seeing the best in all around us.\\"  Death  McMullen died from oesophagal cancer on 10 February 2015. At least one memorial fund has been started in his name.

It is a basic example of descent, since it says the \\"equivariant data\\" (which is an additional data) allows one to \\"descend\\" from X to Y. When G is the Galois group of a finite Galois extension L/K, for the G-torsor operatorname{Spec} L to operatorname{Spec} K, this generalizes classical Galois descent (cf. field of definition). For example, one can take F to be the stack of quasi- coherent sheaves (in an appropriate topology). Then F(X)G consists of equivariant sheaves on X; thus, the descent in this case says that to give an equivariant sheaf on X is to give a sheaf on the quotient X/G.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 3, 2015, and is written by Jaydi Samuels and directed by Brian Iles. In the episode, Peter's friends grow tired of his drunken boasts that he can beat up Irish actor and former amateur boxing champion Liam Neeson; when Neeson finds out, he promises not to beat up Peter if he becomes his personal servant. Meanwhile, Stewie becomes jealous of the attention Lois gives to another boy. Plot Glenn Quagmire holds his Quagfest to celebrate his 1,000th sexual conquest, which turns out to be with a largemouth bass. After Peter learns that Irish actor Liam Neeson is making a film about a vengeance-seeking Albert Einstein in Waterbury, Connecticut, his repeated drunken boasts about how he can beat Neeson in a fight exhaust the patience of Quagmire, Joe, and Cleveland, who decide to arrange for Peter to prove himself in a battle against Neeson. Peter tries various ways to meet Neeson. His first attempt was to dress as Mrs. Potato Head to lure him out ‚Äì only to attract Colin Farrell. Then he sets up a fake confession booth, which draws Neeson, who confesses to killing hundreds of wolves and stealing items from 7-Eleven. When Peter states his reason for being there to security, he is arrested. While his friends work to raise his bail money, he is bailed out by Neeson, who is appalled by Peter boasting he can beat him up. Peter hits Neeson with a metal food tray, only to have the tray dented and Neeson uninjured. Before Neeson can take a punch at him, a flinching Peter offers him his services, to which Neeson agrees. Meanwhile, Lois volunteers to be a class mother at Stewie's preschool, much to his chagrin, and becomes jealous when she pays attention to another infant, Landon. He tries various ways to get the better of Landon, such as making him swallow a whole grape and seducing his mother, which both fail. Stewie eventually reaches his breaking point and breaks down, confessing his envy to Lois, who tells him he shall always be her little baby, to which Stewie is relieved to hear and rubs it in Landon's face. The tasks Neeson has Peter do are eccentric and humiliating, such as pretending to be him on jury duty to get out of a case against the Kraken from Clash of the Titans, asking showering people to urinate in his hands, and updating Neeson's Twitter account. When Peter returns to his friends, he claims he did defeat Neeson. When Neeson texts him for another favor, he returns to Connecticut, and before Peter can do the favor, his friends arrive and Peter admits his lie. When Neeson once again asks Peter for the hand urination favor, Peter finally rebels - causing Neeson to smack him; they brawl and Neeson wins easily. Despite losing, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe are amazed that Peter went through with the battle and impressed he wasn't killed. Peter then cheerfully says that the lesson of this entire saga was that \\"Oskar Schindler wasn't real, and neither was anything else in that movie\\", though Quagmire looks uncomfortable and says he doesn't think that was the lesson. Production Liam Neeson voiced himself in the episode. The episode was written by Jaydi Samuels, who started out in 2008 as a production assistant on Family Guy. The show's writers were excited after Neeson agreed to say any line that they wrote except, \\"I‚Äôve been a world-famous tough guy since 56\\", which he altered on the basis that he was 55 when he filmed Taken. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly ahead of the thirteenth season, Family Guy executive producer Steve Callaghan told reporter Dan Snierson of Neeson's performance in the episode \\"This ranks up there with Taken. Maybe not Taken 2, but definitely Taken\\". Neeson had previously been parodied in the episode \\"Prick Up Your Ears\\", in which John Viener played him in a joke mocking his attempts at an American accent. He also had a cameo role as himself in the twelfth season episode \\"Brian's a Bad Father\\". Reception The episode was watched by 3.71 million people, making it the least viewed show in its timeslot, but the most watched show on Fox that night. Writing for IGN, Jesse Schedeen called the episode a \\"pretty standard, mediocre installment of Family Guy\\", troubled by too many cutaways and random pop culture references. However, he said that it was improved by Neeson, who \\"reveled in the chance to poke fun at his stardom\\".

Stieglitz, meaning goldfinch, was borrowed into German from a Slavic language, probably Old Czech stehlec. The surname can have several possible origins. It is considered to have been an ornamental eke-name originally applied to a prominent family, noticeable in appearance for particularly (golden or strawberry) blonde-coloured hair, of Ashkenazi Jews residing within what is now central Germany, from whom Ludwig von Stieglitz was raised to the Russian nobility, and of Protestant Leipzig patricians of German nobility. With the consolidation and expansion eastwards of the German Empire, the name spread. The original German name has also shifted orthographically to and beyond; later, Stieglitz was also transcribed to in Polish and in Russian. It can be a nickname applied to someone who was cheerful or dressed in colorful clothing. It could also be an occupational name for someone who traded birds or caught them. In rare cases it can refer to origin from the Polish village of Siedlisko near Trzcianka, which was formerly called Stieglitz. Stieglitzens Hof in 1890 Anton Graff (1736‚Äì1813), the Family of Wilhelm Ludwig von Stieglitz, 1782 Coat of arms of the German Barons von Stieglitz, with goldfinch Coat of arms of the Baltic Russian Barons von Stieglitz, with goldfinch Stieglitz family By the mid-18th century, two strands of the Stieglitz family were apparent as having emerged. Bartholomew Stieglitz, Mayor of Plze≈à, Bohemia, was knighted in 1583 by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor as Stieglitz von ƒåenkov; his son Kaspar and grandson Melchior Stieglitz fled to Saxony during the Thirty Years' War, where the family has since been established. In 1765, this patent of nobility was recognised by the Leipzig Council, and his great-grandson , long-time Mayor of Leipzig, was posthumously ennobled, he and his descendants occupying the in the central market square of Leipzig, forming a prominent political and legal dynasty of patricians. Sophie Charlotte von Stieglitz (1776‚Äì1839), the daughter of his son Wilhelm Ludwig von Stieglitz, an electoral Major of the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg who was granted , in 1799 married Dresden City Governor and was mother of Austrian general . Mannichswalde was inherited by Thuisko von Stieglitz (1808‚Äì1881), the Royal Saxon Lieutenant General and Chief of the General Staff; his son Georg von Stieglitz (1848‚Äì1912) was a Saxon Lieutenant General, while his son Robert von Stieglitz (1865‚Äì1933) was a diplomat and the last Saxon envoy to the South German courts. The family also possessed Castle Langburkersdorf in Neustadt in Sachsen and Friedenthal in Hildburghausen. Meanwhile, in 1725, 160 miles to the West in Bad Arolsen in the State of Waldeck, central Germany, Levi Stieglitz is recorded as arriving from nearby Bad Laasphe with his daughter, his two sons Hirsch Bernhard and Lazarus Stieglitz following in 1760. The family was granted Schutzjude status by Friedrich Karl August, with Hirsch Bernhard, his youngest son Jacob Friedrich, and Lazarus Stieglitz all serving as influential Court Jews (merchant bankers) to the Waldeckian Prince. Johann Stieglitz, eldest son of Lazarus Stieglitz, was sent to attend school in Gotha and studied philosophy in Berlin, later pursuing medicine at the University of G√∂ttingen and practising as a physician in Hannover from 1789. Studying together in G√∂ttingen, he became an erstwhile friend of Wilhelm von Humboldt, even saving him from drowning in the Leine. Emigration Nikolai (1770‚Äì1820) and Boris Bernhard Stieglitz (1774‚Äì1846), also sons of Lazarus Stieglitz, both emigrated to Kherson, Ukraine, to expand the family merchant business, becoming Imperial Russian Privy Councillors, the latter going on to become a successful merchant in Poltava, while the former eventually progressed to work in the Ministry of Finance in Saint Petersburg. Lazarus Stieglitz's youngest son Ludwig Stieglitz similarly moved as a young man to Russia as a representative of the family business, becoming an entrepreneur and banker of great capacity and influence, eventually appointed by Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I to be court banker, investing in the construction of a steamship line between L√ºbeck and Saint Petersburg. The family received the hereditary Russian nobility, with Ludwig's son Alexander von Stieglitz inheriting the running of the Stieglitz & Company bank, which he liquidated in 1863, becoming the first President of the State Bank of the Russian Empire. Many of the Stieglitz were elevated to the peerage, styling themselves as Barons , and electing to adopt a goldfinch (rousant) for their heraldic crest; in 1846 was similarly elected Baron by the King of Saxony, and the family expanded throughout central Europe. His youngest son Heinrich Ludwig von Stieglitz (1762‚Äì1824) emigrated from Pilsen to County Armagh, Ireland; Heinrich's family, including , later emigrated to Van Diemen's Land and Victoria in Australia in the 1830s to establish sheep runs on land grants and are considered early pioneers of Australia, establishing the (ironically misspelled) town of Steiglitz, Victoria. At the same time Hirsch Bernard's eldest son Joseph Stieglitz emigrated to establish his company Mark & Sterlitz in New York City. Many family members, however, emigrated to Britain and America in the latter half of the 19th century and during the 20th century to escape the pogroms. Nevertheless, despite the family's extent throughout the German Empire by the 1850s, they were still concentrated in central Germany; Edward Stieglitz (1833‚Äì1909), father of Alfred Stieglitz and Julius Stieglitz, for instance emigrated to Hoboken, New Jersey, from Stadtlengsfeld, only 75 miles south-east of Bad Arolsen.

It is a surgical emergency. Presentation Vaginal evisceration is typically obvious upon presentation, as intestine (typically ileum) can be seen protruding from the introitus. Other symptoms include a sense of pressure in the pelvis and vaginal bleeding.  Complications  Complications of surgery can include injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, especially in cases where there has been tissue necrosis. Surgeons typically perform intraoperative cystoscopy with dye to assess potential bladder or ureter injuries. Causes Vaginal evisceration is a serious complication of dehiscence (where a surgical wound reopens after the procedure), which can be due to trauma. 63% of reported cases of vaginal evisceration follow a vaginal hysterectomy (where the uterus removal surgery is performed entirely through the vaginal canal). Most instances of vaginal evisceration following a laparoscopic hysterectomy result from sexual intercourse among women approaching menopause, and from the combination of heightened pressure within the abdomen and weakened vaginal muscles among those who have experienced menopause. Other risk factors include regular Valsalva maneuver, advanced age, obesity, smoking, immunosuppressive therapy, vaginoplasty, anemia, poor surgical technique, malnutrition, and postoperative/perioperative infection. One case has been reported as of 2015 where placement of a pessary caused an evisceration. Dehiscence is more common in laparoscopic hysterectomy than in open hysterectomy.  Prevention  The uterus being removed in a laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy When performing a vaginal hysterectomy, surgeons should aim to avoid damaging surrounding tissue or drying the vaginal cuff. Surgeons should take extra care to align the tissues, and include sufficient undamaged tissue. Instead of single-layer figure-of-eight sutures, two-layer sutures can aid in preventing vaginal evisceration. Treatment  Emergently, vaginal eviscerations are treated by keeping the exposed intestines moist and wrapped, while waiting for definitive surgical treatment. Vaginal evisceration is usually treated by removing damaged tissue along the edges of the vaginal cuff, re-suturing the opening, and giving the patient broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis. Surgery can be conducted via a laparotomy, though research from the 2010s shows that a transvaginal or laparoscopic approach can also be used safely and successfully if an infection has not developed. If left untreated, it can cause peritonitis or injury to the exposed bowel, including strangulation or mesenteric tears. Cellulitis, abscesses, hematomas, and other complications can appear at the same time as an evisceration. Abscesses and hematomas can be resolved after surgery with a surgical drain. Post-surgical treatment includes continuation of antibiotics and, in some postmenopausal people, vaginal estrogen to speed recovery. After surgery, people with vaginal evisceration are advised to avoid intercourse until the surgical site is fully healed.  Epidemiology  Though it is a rare complication, as the popularity of laparoscopic hysterectomy has risen, the rate of vaginal evisceration has also risen. Vaginal cuff dehiscence occurs in 0.24‚Äì0.39% of cases; of these, vaginal evisceration occurs in 35%‚Äì67%. When all surgical procedures are considered, the rate of vaginal evisceration is 0.032‚Äì1.2%.  History  The first case of vaginal evisceration that was described in the medical literature occurred in 1864.

Michael George Mulhall (1836-1900) was an Irish author, statistician, economist and newspaper editor. He co-founded the Buenos Aires Standard, which in 1862 became the first English-language newspaper to be published daily in South America. He co-authored the first English-language book published in that continent, The Handbook of the River Plate, a work that went to six editions, was widely consulted by immigrants and is now a historical sourcebook. His Dictionary of Statistics (1883 and later editions) became a standard work of reference. Life Mulhall was born on 29 September 1836 in Dublin, Ireland, the third son of Thomas Mulhall. He was educated for the priesthood at the Irish College, Rome, but not having the vocation emigrated to Argentina to work with his brother Edward Thomas Mulhall, then a large sheep farmer in that country. In 1861 the Mulhall brothers founded the Buenos Aires Standard, which next year became a daily; it was the preferred newspaper of the Anglo-Argentine community and claimed to be the only English-language daily newspaper to be published south of the equator.Burton, Captain Sir Richard, Letters From the Battle-Fields of Paraguay, (Tinsley Brothers, London 1870), p.182. (\\"At the junction of Belgrano you look to the left, and see the office of the Standard, the only English daily published south of the equator, say the editors. May their supply of the paddles with which the Paraguayan canoes attacked the Brazilian ironclads never be less!\\" ) (A third brother Francis Healey Mulhall also emigrated to Argentina and founded the ‚Äò‚ÄôSouthern Cross‚Äô‚Äô, a newspaper of the Irish-Argentine community.)

Taxonomy C. zealandica was originally described by the British entomologist Adam White as Rhisotrogus zealandicus from a specimen obtained during the Ross expedition.  Identification/description  New Zealand grass grubs are one of the most common insects in New Zealand. Grass grubs belong to the holometabolous insect group, this means that they have a life cycle with four stages: egg, larva, pupa, adult. The adult beetle can grow up to a mature length of 13 mm. It has a shiny brown colouring with a thick wing covering called an elytra. Adult beetles also have a prominent plate like piece covering the thorax called the pronotum. These adults can be seen flying in the evenings during the summer months. Female adults lay up to 100 eggs at a time into wet or loose soil, 10‚Äì15 days after mating. Eggs are small, white, oval shaped and around 1.5 mm in diameter. 3‚Äì4 days after being laid, the eggs turn smooth, spherical, and start to swell by absorbing moisture. Once the eggs are mature they turn a dark brown/black colour. On hatching larvae have a whitish/grey C-shaped segmented body, with a darker coloured head and dark brown jaws (mandibles). The larvae have three pairs of legs (true legs) attached to the underside of the segment behind the head, called the thorax. The length of the larvae ranges from 5 mm, when newly hatched, to 25 mm at larval maturity. Newly hatched larvae weigh 2‚Äì3 mg and grow up to 200 mg. The most obvious characteristic of larva is that the abdomen is very swollen and looks a lot bigger than any other part of body. There are many thin fine hairs along both sides of the body, especially around the abdomen. Occasionally grass grub larvae can be found that are purple/yellow or green in colour, these are diseased. The pupae start off the same creamy white colour as the larvae, but slowly turn to a dark brown during pupation. They have a soft body and are generally shorter and thicker than the grass grub larvae, they grow to between 10‚Äì30 mm in length. The pupae have a thin translucent skin called the epidermal layer, through which the developing wings and legs can be seen.Child, J. (1974). New Zealand insects(2nd ed.).

Christchurch, New Zealand: Lincoln University College of Agriculture  Distribution  Costelytra zealandica is endemic to and are found throughout New Zealand. There are, however similar species, found in other countries like Acrossidius tasmaniae, Tasmanian grass grub found in Tasmania, Australia. Grass grubs prefer altitudes below 1200m, with favored soil types being free-draining loam soils, but they are also found in peaty or sandy soils.Unelius, C. R., Townsend, R. J., Mundy, D. C., Manning, L. M., Jackson, T. A., & Suckling, D. M. (2008). Comparisons of traps and lures for monitoring grass grub, Costelytra zealandica. New Zealand Plant Protection, 61, 215-221 Life cycle/phenology New Zealand grass grub has an annual life cycle, taking typically one year under normal climatic conditions but can take up to two years in adverse weather such as drought or significant cold periods (this also includes periods where the soil moisture is very high), or due to a food shortage. Over that one-year period the adult beetles live for 4‚Äì6 weeks emerging in spring (October ‚Äì December) when the air temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius, and undertake two main flights, the first flight is to mate and the second and consecutive are to feed and lay clutches of eggs. Females are the last to emerge from the soil, this leads to localized infestations due to them being unable to reach a significant distance before being mated. Egg cluster size can range from 5-80 eggs and range from 80‚Äì250 mm below the surface of the soil. Females can lay two to three clusters over a two to three week period. Costelytra zealandica larvae hatch between November and March (depending on the time they were laid). They start to feed on roots of clover and pasture plants from the time they hatch until September. They undergo three stages called instars before pupation. During the summer months the grubs moult and reach their second instar phase, by early autumn they are usually fully grown and have reached their third instar phase, this is when they are the most detrimental to pastures as it is the final feeding phase before winter. In late autumn and during winter they retreat downwards and out of the top 5 cm of soil and burrow down between 50‚Äì200 mm into the soil. During this phase the grubs undergo a colour change from grayish/white into a yellow/cream colour. Once they reach the appropriate depth, the grub empties its stomach and starts to form a smooth oval shaped cell, the developing wings and legs can be seen through the then translucent skin (epidermal layer) as its making its transition to pupae, the size range is Size range of pupae is 10‚Äì30 mm in length. This procedure takes place over 30‚Äì40 days. The change from pupae to mature beetle takes place over 4‚Äì6 weeks but they remain in the soil for up to a week to lets its newly formed outer skin harden, then it proceeds to dig its way up to the surface of the pasture. The grass grub populations usually increase in a 3-5 year cycle before crashing usually due to a buildup of disease in the soil.Townsend, R. J., & Jackson, T. A. (1997). Grass grub - a persistent problem in Canterbury pastures.Jackson, T., Townsend, R., & Barlow, N. (1999). Predicting grass grub population change in Canterbury. Costelytra zealandica illustrated by Des Helmore showing the internal morphology. Diet and foraging frameless The larvae of Costelytra zealandica tend to feed on fine roots of pasture plants like Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and White Clover (Trifolium repens). Originally only native species of grasses such as tussocks were affected but they have subsequently adapted to feed on the exotic species that have been brought into New Zealand, as their abundance continues to grow. Adult beetles feed on leaves of trees, shrubs, brassicas and foliage of pasture crops. If there is a concentrated group of beetles flying in one area there is potential to defoliate seedling crops and fruit trees. Predators, parasites, and diseases There are some species of pasture grasses, legumes, and herbs that are naturally tolerant of grass grubs including cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and chicory (Cichorium intybus) and some that are resistant like Phalaris (Phalaris aquatica), Lucerne, (Alfalfa), (Medicago sativa) and Lotus (Lotus uliginosus), (Lotus major). ;Predators Because they are insects, Grass Grub fall prey to almost all bird species present in the same areas, some examples of avian predators are; Larus marinus, Great black backed gull, especially when the areas inhabited by Grass Grub, undergo cultivation, Starlings Sturnus vulgaris and Black Birds Turdus merula seem to favour Grass Grub larvae in their third instar phase, as well as the adult beetle, and are often seen actively digging through the soil in areas with a high Grass Grub population. Another common predator of the Grass Grub is the Hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus whose intake of Grass Grub can be up to 40% of the total diet of an adult hedgehog. There are few invertebrate predators but they are not common in pastures. ;Parasites There have been recordings of Diptera species being parasites and predators of New Zealand grass grub, an example is Proscissio cana which parasitizes larvae in the third instar phase and is present in the Canterbury High country, but it only parasitizes around 20% of larvae present. In November 2012 researchers in New Zealand discovered an unknown maggot preying on Grass Grub larvae, 35-50% of the grubs in the near bye area were parasitized, DNA samples from these maggots were not matched to any known species so a sample was collected and allowed to pupate and eventually hatch where they were finally identified as Ostenia robusta. The genus Ostenia only contains one species that of O. robusta which is endemic to New Zealand not much is known about their biology or ecology. The fly larvae which is maggot like and approximately 11mm in length, has a wrinkly tapered head and dark mouthparts. They don‚Äôt have any features that are distinguishable, so its hard to identify in the field without DNA sequencing being done or, rearing the larvae to the adult mature stage for identification. ;Diseases Because grass grub build up large colonies in the soil, disease can spread quickly and be devastating to the population, the most common disease of the New Zealand Grass Grub is Amber Disease. Amber Disease is a chronic infection of the stomach of grass grub larvae, and is caused by two strains of bacteria, Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans. The bacteria Serratia entomophila is available for purchase commercially as a biocontrol agent. Once these pathogenic bacteria have been ingested, the infected larvae stop eating within 2‚Äì5 days, and gain an amber colouring due to the stomach emptying, and the levels of major digestive enzymes (trypsin and chymotrypsin) in the mid-gut decreasing. However, the infected larvae won‚Äôt die for another 1‚Äì3 months after becoming infected. Amber disease can carry over into following generations as it is applied at a subsurface level of soil. It was first isolated in Mid Canterbury, New Zealand in 1981. Jackson, T. A., & Glare, T. R. (1990). Diseases of the New Zealand grass grub, Costelytra zealandica.

Previous findings show that the cost of crop damage due to Costelytra zealandica is said to be around $89million per year.

The castle located between Aleja Pod Kasztanami and Aleja Lubomirski, Chopin Street, ≈öreniawit√≥w Square and Colonel Lis-Kula Street. Currently the castle houses the seat of the provincial court, the building housed a prison up until 1981. An early fortress stood on the castle's grounds since the sixteenth century. At the end of the same century, Miko≈Çaj Spytek Ligƒôza built a Motte-and-bailey castle close by to the current castle's location. In 1620 he expanded the castle into a \\"Palazzo in fortezza\\". Since 1637 the castle was put under the ownership of the House of Lubomirski. Most of the building works were done by Tylman van Gameren and Karol Henryk Wiedemann. In 1820 the complex was brought under Austrian authorities; which adapted the building for a courthouse and a prison. The building was deconstructed at the beginning of the twentieth century due to its poor state. The only parts left from the original complex are the gatehouse and bastion fortifications. The Lubomirski Palace is located close to the Castle. History of the Castle Possession of Miko≈Çaj Spytek Ligƒôza The founder of the Castle was the castellan of Czch√≥w and Sandomierz Miko≈Çaj Spytek Ligƒôza. The land was partially owned Rzesz√≥w's El≈ºbieta Komarnicka, widow of Adam Rzeszowski. The rest of the nearby lands were owned by El≈ºbieta's sisters - Katarzyna and Zofia. =Primordial embankments= The capital of Rzesz√≥w's lands was located on a loess hill, in between Wis≈Çok flood waters, allowing natural defences. The residence was located on top of a cliff side, in the town of Ligƒôza. If such complex existed, it would have stone fortifications and wooden farm houses in the centre. The fortress' courtyard was made of mud and wood, strengthened by wooden towers, located in its corners. The Ligƒôza fortress was expanded during the sixteenth century, whose fortifications are still currently found. =First defensive fortress= Not a lot is known about the initial construction of Ligƒôza's fortress (castle). No information about the architect nor scripture of the fortress has been preserved. Most of the information gathered about the complex is of the stock-taking done by Zygmund Hendel in 1897. The main building of the complex was fortificated with walls, it had several levels and a double-courtyard located in the northern part of the complex. The complex's floor plan was similar to that of a square. Close by to the complex there was a number of warehouses - whose function remains uncertain. The whole complex and warehouses were surrounded by a thick defensive wall - whose thickness passed 1,5 metres. The three parts of the complex (east, west and south) all had posterns with battery artillery. The fortification was strengthened by a bastion, located in the south-east corner of the complex's square formation. It is likely that another one stood in the south-west of the complex. There is no other identification for the former existence of two other bastions, although during Ligƒôza's reign they might have been planned. The gate which allowed access to head into the castle was located, where it currently is, in the middle of the western wall. The main reason for Ligƒôza to build such powerful and well defended fortress may have been to so to underline his importance, authority and wealth, making his fortress and fortifications to have a greater role for repressing the people, and accepting his reign, than actually serving as a defensive fortress. Such perception can be strengthened by the accounts of his nephew - Andrzej Ligƒôza, who tried to become his successor. In 1603, he marched his army into Rzesz√≥w - devastating the walls, burned the warehouses and began besieging the castle - which was successful after a few days. Miko≈Çaj Ligƒôza addressed the situation by devastating Andrzej's property in Staroniwa and Zwie≈Ñczyca. In affect Andrzej had looted Rzesz√≥w, regaining the castle. In the following years, Miko≈Çaj Ligƒôza had continued his scuffles with Stanis≈Çaw Stadnicki of ≈Åa≈Ñcut (1600-1605), and with his son W≈Çadys≈Çaw (1617-1619). All of these clashes meant that, after 1620, when Miko≈Çaj Ligƒôza became a castellan, he ordered for a reconstruction of the castle. =Palazzo in fortezza= Castle tower from Kraszewski Street The newly reconstructed castle was built in the newly popular Palazzo in fortezza architectural form. The loess was built up with moats and bastions in a New-Italian style, built up with stone and brick pallium; some parts with clay. The former defensive walls were incorporated as inner walls of the castle. This allowed the castle to have an additional defensive wing. The investment was never finished, however its modernisation allowed for new batteries to be constructed; this had allowed the castle to successfully be defended against by a raid of Tartars. During the reconstruction, the castle had been protected by a full army. The fortifications had been additionally encircled by a wood and partially stone settlements including Mrowla, ≈öwilcza, Krasne and Malawa. Miko≈Çaj Ligƒôza died in 1637. In his testament to his wife he said: fortify the castle and call it the Ligƒôza's and moat it all, ( aby zamku domurowa≈Ça i po wieczne czasy Ligƒôzowem nazwa≈Ça i obwa≈Çowaƒá kaza≈Ça, Polish). =House of Lubomirski= Ligƒôza signed off his castle to his daughters: Pudancja and Konstancja. However, due to the decision taken up by the Crown Tribunal, all of the estate was only given to the Konstancja. This caused scuffles between Pudancja's and Konstancja's husbands; as Konstancja's husband - Court Marshall of the Crown Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski took over the estate. He was an active politician and military commander of the Anti-Crown Opposition. During his reign, the castle did not have military importance, this also included the ≈Åa≈Ñcut Castle - an important residence; this state must have been caused by the castle's devastation. The fortifications were greatly devastated by the Swedes during The Deluge, as well as the Polish army during a rebellion in 1663. Additional damage was caused during a war with the Cossacks. After Lubomirski took on a bannire, he was expelled and moved to Silesia, which caused the fortifications in Rzesz√≥w not to be reconstructed. When Ulryk Werdum passed through the town in 1671 he described it as: In the suburb there stands a beautiful church, and even a better one in town, both made of stone [...]. The castle, a cumbrous structure, stands to the south by the lake. All of these places were in a very good state before the war with the Cossacks, after it everything seems to be abandoned. (Na przedmie≈õciu stoi ≈õliczny ko≈õci√≥≈Ç, a jeszcze lepszy w mie≈õcie, obydwa z kamienia [...]. Ciƒô≈ºko zbudowany zamek wznosi siƒô na po≈Çudnie od miasta nad jeziorem. Wszystko to znajdowa≈Ço siƒô w bardzo dobrym stanie przed wojnƒÖ kozackƒÖ, teraz za≈õ po niej wszystko jest opuszczone. Polish) Jerzey Lubomirski died in 1667, giving the estate to his son, Hieronim Augustyn Lubomirski. In the first few years after his father's death, Hieronim took on dealing with war specialised equipment and crafts - he fought with the Turks, Tatars and Cossacks. Only up until about 1682, did he begin works on reconstructing the castle in Rzesz√≥w, which he entrusted to Tylman van Gameren. =Expansion of the castle by Tylman van Gameren= Due to many battles in the region of Rzesz√≥w, such as the battles with Cossacks and Tatars, the castle's military significance rose. He agreed, after raising the issue at the Sejmik, that he will spend three years to rebuild the castle's fortifications. As stated in Tylman's plans, the castle was rebuilt in a square formation, with four wings both having two levels each, protected by a ravelin at the castle's southern wing. The courtyard's levels had a facade in the central part of the structure. They were finished off by ramparts.

Los Angeles Museum of Art / Roger Wong Gallery records. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. His work from this period includes painting, sculpture, and performance art, reflecting the pluralistic forms of creative expression and the political and social engagement generated by the Los Angeles artistic community. Travel and exposure to diverse cultures had a significant impact on Dailey. During his art education, he traveled to Europe, visiting museums to study paintings and sculptures that inspired him as a student and visiting countries in the Eastern Bloc to learn about the communist political system. In 1976, Dailey set out to Japan with the aim of working with the director Akira Kurosawa, whose films were a source of inspiration. He traveled on the Trans Siberian Express to Japan, transiting through the Soviet Union.Johnson Space Center Oral History Project: Brian Dailey, NASA, p. 8 Meeting artists and writers in East Berlin and along the train stops in Siberia, he became increasingly interested in international relations and the issue of artistic freedom in totalitarian regimes. Dailey's residence in Japan was brief. Discovering that Kurosawa's professional and private life was at a nadir and confronting the challenges of working in Japan, he returned to Los Angeles where he worked with Sam Francis in his Litho Shop and with a number of other leading artists in his capacity as an assistant at ACE Gallery in Venice, California. He also worked for the architect James De Long, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright.James De Long, Obituary, LA Times, May 2, 2013 His growing interest in film and video led to his working as a grip at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles, where he learned filmmaking. Having worked on AFI projects he began to work on his own films using a 16mm Beaulieu camera. Arms control and international security In 1981, Dailey's interest in international affairs and the Cold War led him to pursue a doctorate and a career in international relations. He studied arms control, Russian studies, and diplomatic history at the University of Southern California, receiving his degree in 1987 with a dissertation on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.Brian D.

Return to art Dailey returned to art full-time in 2008, leveraging his experiences in the intervening decades in his creative practice.Lockheed's Top Lobbyist Calling It a Career His approach to art is both conceptual and performance based, inviting the viewer's participation. In his frequent use of the photographic tableau vivant, Dailey explores topical existential questions and utilizes composite imagery as a vehicle for making critical commentary on contemporary social and political issues.Brian Dailey Art These staged \\"living pictures\\" have been featured in exhibitions in Europe and the United States (see selected exhibitions below). Dailey's early interest in film resurfaces in his current practice. His video Jikai (2012) alludes to Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, employing a moth fatally drawn to light. Dedicated to Kurosawa, the video is a meditation on political disintegration. Jikai was screened on multiple synchronized monitors in New York City in February 2014 as the featured video in the Times Square Midnight Moment series.February Midnight Moment to Showcase Brian Dailey's Moth to a Flame Video Showcasing the Power and Danger of Attraction (January 31, 2014): Dailey has had solo exhibitions in Los Angeles, New York, and Bulgaria and participated in a number of group shows in the United States, Europe, and Russia.

Roughly bounded by Cedar Road, Coventry Road, West St. James Parkway, and Ardleigh Drive, the site contains primarily residential homes built between 1913 and 1929. The historic district is built on land formerly owned by John D. Rockefeller and at one time leased to the Euclid Golf Club for its back nine holes, and it takes its name from this historic factoid. The Euclid Golf Allotment is a largely undisturbed example of an early 20th century planned community containing American Craftsman, Colonial Revival, French Renaissance Revival, Italian Renaissance Revival, Prairie School, Shingle Style, and Tudor Revival architecture. The Euclid Golf Allotment was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The Euclid Golf Allotment includes the western half of the Fairmount Boulevard District, another national historic district established in 1976. Pre-development John D. Rockefeller in 1911. Founding Forest Hill The modern city of Cleveland Heights is built atop a geological structure known as the Portage Escarpment, a geological feature some wide that connects the Appalachian Plateau in the east to the Erie Plain in the west. Early residents of Cleveland settled along The Flats, a low-lying plain on either side of the Cuyahoga River bounded by steep slopes. Although farms initially occupied the Erie Plain above The Flats on both sides of the river, by the American Civil War middle- and upper class homes dominated these areas. Through the middle and late 1800s, a thriving business district grew on the east side of the Cuyahoga around Public Square (conceived in 1796 as the center of the town) and later Clinton Square (built in 1835). The city continued rapidly expanding eastward through the 1800s. As Cleveland became an industrial powerhouse in the late 1800s, it developed an extremely wealthy upper class. Euclid Avenue became the preferred address for more than 300 of the wealthiest families in the United States. Euclid Avenue reached its zenith in the 1890s, but began a three-decade rapid decline thereafter as extensive retail development drove the upper class eastward. The early pressures placed on Euclid Avenue-dwellers led to the creation of the Forest Hill estate. In 1873, wealthy Clevelander John D. Rockefeller purchased east of his home at 424 Euclid Avenue. In June 1874, Rockefeller sold of this land to investors who wished to build a sanatorium on the site. A hotel was built atop the highest hill on this land, and Rockefeller and fellow Standard Oil investor Stephen V. Harkness founded a commuter rail line, the Lake View and Collamer Railroad, to serve the sanatorium. But the hospital never opened, and the sanatorium venture failed. Rockefeller purchased the land back in 1877 transformed the hotel into his summer home, and named the estate Forest Hill. Much of the estate, however, was managed as timber farm. Founding of Euclid Heights and the Euclid Club The development of electric streetcars made the development of suburbs far outside Cleveland's city limits practical for the first time in the 1890s. In 1890, railroad baron Patrick Calhoun purchased atop nearby Cedar Hill, and in 1893 established the planned community of Euclid Heights. It was common at the time for deed restrictions governing type of construction, land use, occupancy, and more to be used when zoning laws and regulations did not exist, and Calhoun's Euclid Heights prohibited retail within the development to prevent Euclid Heights from becoming another Euclid Avenue. (Depreciation in residential home values was quite common at the time, and it was not unrealistic for a family to fear loss of their home due to retail development.) To further enhance the value of the development, Calhoun organized the Euclid Golf Club. With a course designed by British professional golfer W.H. \\"Bertie\\" Way, the club opened in 1901. The clubhouse was located on Norfolk Road, between Derbyshire and Cedar roads. The first, second, and ninth greens were located due west of the clubhouse, in the area framed by Euclid Heights Road and Cedar Road. The fourth through eighth greens ran largely north and south in the area framed by Cedar Road, Harcourt Drive, North Park Boulevard, and Bellfield Avenue. The back nine holes were in the area framed by Cedar Road, Grandview Avenue, North Park Boulevard, and Demington Drive. The club didn't own the land beneath the back nine, however. This was part of Rockefeller's Forest Hill estate. Calhoun asked Rockefeller, an avid golfer, to lease the necessary area to the club. Rockefeller agreed to do so, and required no lease payment‚Äîprovided no golf was played on Sunday. Encroachment of Cedar Heights and Shaker Heights Typical home on Fairmount Blvd. in the Euclid Golf Allotment The Euclid Club was hindered by another development, Cedar Heights. Concurrent with the development of Euclid Heights, William and Edmund Walton, Jr. purchased a pasture adjacent to the western boundary of Forest Hill. They built two roads, Grandview Avenue and Bellfield Avenue. They began developing the lots on the east side of Grandview Avenue, the west side of Bellfield Avenue, and between Grandview and Bellfield Avenues, and constructed middle-class homes similar to their previous development in Little Italy. Cedar Heights was marketed only sparingly and developed slowly. But the development sat squarely and inconveniently between the front nine and back nine of the Euclid Club. The creation of the Shaker Heights development largely doomed the golf club. A community of Shakers founded a commune and farm in the area in 1822, but their numbers had dwindled to just 27 by 1888. In a series of transactions, the Shakers sold the land to a group of Cleveland investors in 1891 who called themselves the Shaker Heights Land Company. The company then donated of land along Doan Brook, Horseshoe Lake (aka Upper Shaker Lake), and Lower Shaker Lake in December 1895 to the city of Cleveland as a park, with the proviso that the city build a road along the park (which effectively connected the Shaker Heights development to Cleveland). Rockefeller donated another as well, to connect this park to Lake Erie (creating Rockefeller Park). Sales remained meager, however, and the company sold its land holdings in 1896 to a syndicate of Buffalo investors led by William Henry Gratwick, Sr. (owner of the Gratwick Steamship Company) and John J. Albright (president of the Ontario Power Company). Once more, sales were minimal. Eight years later, the land was overgrown and its value was 25 percent below its $316,000 ($ in dollars) purchase price. In 1904, the Van Sweringen brothers, Oris Paxton and Mantis James, took over as land agents for the company, formed a syndicate of local investors, and began purchasing lots for development from the Shaker Heights Land Company. As with Calhoun's Euclid Heights, the Van Sweringens used deed restrictions to significantly constrain development to residential housing, and to require that all housing be of the highest quality in terms of design, siting, and construction. The development of Shaker Heights adjoined the Rockefeller estate. Rockefeller was intrigued by the possibility of developing Forest Hill, and allowed the Van Sweringens to produce a brochure showing how a possible development of the eastern half of his \\"back nine\\" could be developed into yet another planned community. But nothing came of this venture. In 1906, Rockefeller agreed to allow the Van Sweringens to build a streetcar line across the Forest Hills estate. The line followed Cedar Road, and then traveled in the center of Fairmount Boulevard to Lee Road. Although a part of Fairmount Boulevard had existed since 1858, the portion from Cedar Road southeast to Lee Road was only developed at this time‚Äîcutting right across the Euclid Club's back nine. Closure of the Euclid Club A significant number of Euclid Club members quit in 1909 and founded the Mayfield Country Club about to the east in Lyndhurst, Ohio. The Euclid Club discontinued its operations in 1912,; The rest of the members left in 1913 to form the Shaker Heights Country Club, which opened in 1915. The Euclid Club briefly reopened the links in 1915, but ceased operations again the same year. Building the Euclid Golf Allotment Empty lot on the northeast corner of Demington Drive and Fairmount Blvd. on which Barton Deming had his sales office. In 1913, Barton R. Deming convinced John D. Rockefeller to enter into a purchase agreement for the formerly leased to the Euclid Club. The Canadian- born Deming and several of his brothers had moved to Cleveland in 1893. After working for other companies for several years, he and his brothers formed Deming Brothers, a real estate development company, in 1903 and developed several high-quality neighborhoods in East Cleveland. Deming's brother, Grant, owned several other real estate development firms, which had done business with Rockefeller in developing other parts of the Forest Hill estate. Through this work, Barton Deming came to know John D. Rockefeller. Deming founded the B.R. Deming Company to develop the Euclid Golf Allotment. Under the agreement struck by Deming and Rockefeller, Deming could plat or make improvements to the property only with the approval of Abeyton Realty Company, a firm founded by Rockefeller in 1909 to oversee his real estate ventures. The Euclid Golf lots were to be smaller than those in Euclid Heights, for Clarence C. Terrill, manager of Abeyton Realty, felt that the overly large lot size had inhibited Calhoun's sales. While Rockefeller bankrolled the improvements, Deming had control over sales. Initially, the Euclid Golf development ran into financial trouble. Lot prices fell due to competition from neighboring developments. The situation worsened when Euclid Heights developer Patrick Calhoun declared bankruptcy in 1916, and his vast Euclid Heights holdings were sold at a sheriff's sale at rock-bottom prices. Deming was forced to renegotiate his agreement with Rockefeller in 1915. In order to retain his position as the sole sales agent for Euclid Golf until July 31, 1916, Deming was forced to invest $89,747 ($ in dollars) of his own money into the development. In return, Abeyton Realty invested $320,000 ($ in dollars) in laying drinking water, electrical power, natural gas, and sewer lines and building new paved roads, complete with gutters and curbs. The new agreement also required Deming to sell lots at a minimum price and no less. Once Deming made his initial investment payment, he was permitted to purchase the rest of the property for $430,000 ($ in dollars). Sales were strong thereafter, and on October 3, 1919, Deming paid $463,158.40 ($ in dollars) for the remainder of the Euclid Golf Allotment. Layout and architectural principles Typical homes on Woodmere Drive in the Euclid Golf Allotment. Deming platted the Euclid Golf Allotment according to the principles of the \\"garden city movement\\", then a popular design strategy for wealthy suburbs. He retained as much of the natural beauty of the area as possible, and imitated other developers freely when their practices proved successful. For example, despite its past use as a golf course, the Euclid Golf Allotment was heavily wooded with mature deciduous trees. Deming required that builders retain as many of these as possible during home construction, so that the value of the land would be as high as possible. (Many of these trees still exist in the 2000s.) Deming also decided to dig Fairmount Boulevard on either side of the Cleveland Railway line which already existed on the property. A wide roadway was created on both sides of the railway line, and Deming's engineers mimicked the design of Fairmount Boulevard in Shaker Heights (laid out by the F. A. Pease Engineering Company). To meet the requirements of the amended agreement with Rockefeller, Deming first had to lay out streets (which would then allow him to plat the development). These streets all gently curved, both because this met the design principles of the \\"garden city\\" movement but also because it allowed streets to conform to the sloping, ravine-ridden geography of the site. All the streets also connected easily and naturally to those of surrounding developments. Seven deed restrictions significantly limited the type and design of structures which could be erected in the Euclid Golf Allotment. Six restrictions were initially placed on construction. The first limited structures to private residential homes, specified a minimum expenditure for construction, established setback rules, and required the approval of the B.R. Deming Company before construction could begin. The goal of the restriction was to assist the builder in achieving the highest possible quality, rather than to limit him. The second restriction established minimum expenditure levels and setback rules for garages and outbuildings, and prohibited outhouses. The third limited fence height to , and established setback rules for fences. The fourth restriction barred a wide range of uses for structures, including apartments, boarding houses, taverns, and a wide range of public entertainment venues (such as dance halls and movie theaters). The fifth prohibited occupants from manufacturing or selling alcohol on the premises. The sixth deed restriction regulated the placement and size of advertising signs or similar devices. A seventh restriction, added to plots sold later, required that landscaping adhere to standards set by the B.R. Deming Company. All deed restrictions expired on May 1, 1950. Home construction To entice buyers, and to demonstrate how architectural creativity was not stifled by the deed restrictions, Deming hired the architectural firm of Howell & Thomas to design several model homes for the development. Nearly all the model homes were built before 1920, and 12 of the 45 structures built on Fairmount Boulevard were model houses designed by Howell & Thomas. The very first model house was Deming's own home, constructed on a narrow, curving, steep parcel of land at 2645 Fairmount Boulevard. The $6,000 home ($ in dollars) was designed to act as a gateway to the development, impressing visitors with its high quality and stylishness as they entered the Euclid Golf Allotment. Construction on the Deming house began on started May 4, 1914, and it was largely complete by the end of the year. St. James Parkway was the first street Deming platted. Eighteen of the 22 homes built in Euclid Golf Allotment in the 1910s were constructed on North St. James. West St. James Parkway was the next to be developed. Deming was frustrated by the existence of Roxboro Elementary School and Roxboro Junior High School on the south side of the western half of West St. James Parkway, and by several low-quality duplexes on the south side of the eastern half of West St. James. To protect the Euclid Golf Allotment, Deming contracted with Howell & Thomas to design 14 cottages for construction on the north side of West St. James to screen these low- quality homes from the rest of the development. These were built in the 1910s, with four more in the 1920s. Ten of the 18 houses were in the Colonial Revival style. Deming even purchased three of the remaining lots on the south side of West St. James and built high-quality cottages (2600, 2594, and 2580-2582 West St. James Parkway) to provide an additional screen for the Euclid Golf Development. Non-residential construction Although nearly all the buildings constructed in the Euclid Golf Allotment were private, single-family homes, two structures were not. The first of these was the Heights Medical Building at 2460 Fairmount Boulevard. By the mid-1920s, Deming had turned his attention to the intersection of Cedar Road and Fairmount Boulevard. He had hoped to build apartment buildings east of the intersection, whose tall forms would come even with the higher part of the escarpment on which Euclid Golf Allotment was built. But a number of two- and three-story businesses had been built there by this time. The Heights Medical Building (now restaurants, retail, and offices) was a compromise structure. Designed by the firm of Steffens & Steffens and finished in 1926, the Heights Medical Building was more architecturally similar to structures in Euclid Golf Allotment, but its usage was more similar to that of the lower-quality business structures in Cedar Heights and Euclid Heights nearby. The other major non-residential structure in the Euclid Golf Allotment was St. Paul's Episcopal Church. St. Paul's had been the church of choice of the old Euclid Avenue aristocracy, but the decline of the avenue induced the church to move to Euclid Golf Allotment (where many of its parishioners had taken up residence). The church purchased several lots at the intersection of Coventry Road and Fairmount Boulevard (2747 Fairmount Blvd.), and hired architect J. Byers Hayes of the noted Cleveland architectural firm of Walker and Weeks to design the structure. Construction began on the parish hall in 1927, and services were first held there in April 1928. The bell tower was finished in 1929. The Great Depression halted additional construction for a decade. Construction began on the sanctuary in 1941, but shortages of construction materials during World War II forced work to halt for several years. Hayes revised his plans for the sanctuary in 1947 to reduce its cost, and construction began again in 1949. The sanctuary was finished in 1951. About the historic district The Euclid Golf Allotment was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The historic district contains , all of which are residential except for St. Paul's Episcopal Church (intersection of Coventry Road and Fairmount Blvd.) and Heights Medical Building (intersection of Fairmount Blvd. and Cedar Road). A portion of the Fairmount Boulevard Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, is contained within the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District. The Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District continues to be laid out in accordance with \\"garden city\\" principles. The main road running through historic district if Fairmount Boulevard. Parcels on Fairmount Boulevard typically are wide and deep. Secondary roads running through the historic district include Ardleigh Drive, Chatfield Drive, Delamere Drive, Demington Drive, North St. James Parkway, Roxboro Road, Scarborough Road, Tudor Drive, West St. James Parkway, and Woodmere Drive. Looking at the new narthex entrance and bell tower of St. Paul's Episcopal Church. There are 432 structures in the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District. Fifty-four of these structures are in the Fairmount Boulevard Historic District, and 48 of these 54 are historic. Of the 378 remaining structures, 363 are historic. These include 229 residences, one commercial building, and 133 outbuildings (primarily garages). All of the residences are single-family homes, except for a single duplex and two cottages. Most of the homes in the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District were designed by leading Cleveland-area architects, including Charles Sumner Schneider, Maxwell Norcross, Mead & Hamilton, Howell & Thomas, and Walker & Weeks. Although deed restrictions regulated many aspects of construction and siting, they did not restrict the style of architecture in the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District. Homes were designed in an array of architectural styles, and most homes were designed with elements from several styles. Generally speaking, homes built from 1913 to 1919 are more eclectic and rely on Native American architectural styles, while those built after 1919 tend to draw on more European architectural traditions and tend to be more accurate revival designs. Homes in the Colonial Revival architectural style are the most common in the historic district, representing about half of all structures. Colonial Revival homes built in the 1910s tend to include elements of the Arts & Crafts, Prairie, and Queen Anne architectural styles. Colonial Revival homes built in the 1920s tend to be more purist in style. There are 75 homes in the Tudor Revival architectural style, representing 26.4 percent of all structures in the historic district. Three distinct subgenres of the Tudor Revival style‚ÄîEarly English, Jacobean, and Cottage‚Äîare represented in the allotment. One-hundred-and-thirty-three (47.5 percent) of the homes in the Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District were built between 1913 and 1919. One-hundred-and- thirty-four homes (47.5 percent) were built between 1920 and 1929. Four homes (1.4 percent) were built in the 1930s, and 11 homes (3.9 percent) were constructed after 1950. Most utility lines run in the rear of the houses. Sidewalks are wider than usual, and original sidewalks (made of slate paving) are common. Wide road verges exist between the sidewalk and roadway. Most of the trees in the historic district existed when the development was constructed in the 1910s and 1920s. The Euclid Golf Allotment Historic District retained much of its original character as of 2002. The facades of few homes had been significantly altered, although about two-thirds of slate roofs had been replaced with asphalt or composite shingle roofs. Other changes, such as modern windows instead of leaded glass and enclosure of porches, were also made, but these tended to be minimal. Additions to homes tend to be very uncommon, although generally in the same architectural style as the original structure.

Situated atop a high chalky bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, the white cliffs were frequently mentioned by early river voyagers. The settlement was located approximately south of Natchez, and approximately northeast of Hutchins Landing. History The settlement is named for Richard Ellis, a native of Virginia who moved to the area with his family around 1785. The Ellis family were one of the first to permanently settle in southwestern Mississippi, which was then still under Spanish rule. Ellis established a plantation known as \\"White Cliffs\\", where \\"towering cliffs lined the east side of the river, providing a floodproof access to the water and vast acres of virgin land and timber\\". The foundations of the family's first home were still visible in the early 1900s. When Ellis died in 1792, he had accumulated of land, and more than 150 slaves. By 1800, both the settlement and the cliffs were known as \\"Ellis Cliffs\\". British artist William Constable visited America between 1806‚Äì08 and painted View Down the Mississippi from Ellis's Cliffs, 28 Feby. 1807. Artist John Rowson Smith traveled the Mississippi River before the Civil War and painted The Cotton Region, which included a scene of \\"the house of a colored slave owner at Ellis Cliffs\\". Henry Lewis also painted the river, and described Ellis Cliffs as \\"strikingly bold, wild, and picturesque\\". During the Civil War, Confederate batteries were installed at the top of Ellis Cliffs. The former settlement is today covered by forest, and bordered to the north by the St. Catherine Creek National Wildlife Refuge.

Chirons, Nicholas P. Coal Age Handbook of Coal Surface Mining () The quality attributes that are most important in blending will differ from one mine site to another and also depend on how the coal seams vary in quality and their final intended use. In thermal coals, quality attributes of interest often include ash, volatile matter, total Sulfur, and gross calorific value. For coking coals, additional attributes are sometimes considered including crucible swelling number, fluidity, and RoMax. Blending methodology Blending is typically achieved through the stacking of different materials on a stockpile or within a vessel‚Äôs hatch during ship loading. Stacking methodology (e.g. Chevron, Windrow, Cone Shell, Strata) can also impact the homogeneity of the final blended material. Blending sometimes will take place prior to the Coal Handling and Processing Plant (CHPP) in order to achieve attributes (e.g. feed ash levels) that can improve CHPP production rates. Blending may take place in several locations within the demand chain including: * Before entering the processing plant * Immediately after the processing plant * Train load out * Port stockyard * Ship loading * At the customer stockyard Decision support software Blending decisions impact the total tonnes of each product that a mine site is able to sell. In addition, the quality attributes of a product can impact the final sale value of the product. Because blending has a significant impact on mine site revenue, several decision support systems have been developed with the aim of improving product reliability and profitability. Blend optimization Blend optimization is a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is typically to maximize revenue, Net Present Value (NPV), or monthly product tonnage targets. Whitacre, J., Iorio, A., Schellenberg, S. ‚ÄúCoal Blending: Business Value, Analysis, and Optimization‚Äù https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0276 Important features of the blending problem include: * Each product may consist of many unblended seams or plys (many to 1 mapping) and each seam or ply can contribute to multiple products (1 to many mapping). * Some products constitute a ‚Äúbrand‚Äù which cannot consist of blends with significantly different physical and chemical quality attributes. * Product sale value can change over time due to changing market conditions. * Sufficiently large scale production sizes can influence market fundamentals and thus sale price. * Operating costs are influenced by production rate and it is generally desirable to meet a specified operating capacity for the wash plant as well as to utilize contractual haulage, rail, and shipping capacities. Several constraints must also be taken into account including: * maximum number of ROM types within a blend * minimum tonnage of given ROM type within a blend * maximum number of field stocks from which materials can be blended from Blend Analysis Blend analysis is the process of understanding what blending options exist within a specified schedule and how these options impact product quality, projected revenue, and scheduled mining decisions. Because mathematical optimization algorithms only solve a mathematical model of the physical blending problem, it is typically necessary to make manual adjustments to blends in order to achieve practical/desirable business outcomes. Analytics software tools facilitate this process by enabling a mine planner to easily see what options exist and the consequences of these options.

The private bank is 80 percent owned by the Kahane family and 20 percent by executive and non-executive partners. Gutmann currently manages client assets of ‚Ç¨ 20.5 billion (as of 2019). Clients include domestic and foreign entrepreneurs as well as entrepreneurial families, foundations, wealthy private clients and institutional investors. History Founded in 1922, Bank Gutmann was active in all areas of the banking business at the time, with the exception of accepting savings deposits and issuing bonds and mortgage bonds. Its clientele included the most important companies in the Gutmann Group as well as a number of companies not belonging to the Gutmann Group. Bank Gutmann managed the finances for the companies of the Gutmann Group, but did not hold any shares in them. The Gutmann Group was hit hard by the global economic crisis in the 1930s. After the National Socialists seized power in 1938, the assets of the Gutmann family were \\"aryanised\\". In this context, the liquidation of Bank Gutmann was initiated, but not completed until the end of the Second World War. In 1947, the Gutmann family successfully applied to the Austrian Ministry of Finance for the liquidation to be terminated and for the bank license to be revived. However, Bank Gutmann did not subsequently develop any activities other than the payment of pensions for former employees. In 1957, Karl Kahane acquired the bank from the Gutmanns and began to rebuild the banking business. Initially, the focus was on foreign exchange transactions for leading Austrian companies. After the expansion of further business areas, Bank Gutmann was converted into a public limited company in 1971. In the 1980s, Bank Gutmann placed bonds of the Republic of Austria and state-owned utilities and road construction companies with the country's leading insurance institutions. Bank Gutmann was also involved in the establishment of external pension funds in the 2000s as an investor and consultant. Business area Bank Gutmann has specialized in asset management and investment consulting since the 1980s. Gutmann's clients include domestic and foreign entrepreneurs, foundations, wealthy private clients and families as well as institutional investors. In addition to asset management and investment advice for private clients, Gutmann's area of activity also includes institutional clients. Over the years, private equity and real estate have also developed into specific areas of expertise. In addition to its core business in Austria, Bank Gutmann serves clients from Central and Eastern Europe, Germany and Latin America.

She enrolled at the Universidad del Salvador, a Jesuit university in Buenos Aires, in 1985 and graduated with a degree in Political Science in 1990. She entered public service in 1991 as an electoral history researcher at the National General Archives, later serving as an assistant in the Ministries of Education (1992) and the Interior (1993). She taught history, economic, and sociology at the IAES college preparatory school (1991‚Äì92); and social policy at the Argentine National Gendarmerie Officers' School (1994‚Äì95) and the Catholic University of Salta from 2000 to 2002. Rodr√≠guez joined Argentina's White Helmets humanitarian assistance organization as a project planning official in 1994. She contributed in this capacity to White Helmet missions in the Gaza Strip (youth sports); Honduras and Nicaragua (health crisis management in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch); Bolivia (Chagas disease mitigation); Paraguay (family farming); and Argentina itself (flood relief). Rodr√≠guez served in this post until 1999, and was made a member of the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) in April of that year. Her later humanitarian projects include sports development for the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (2002), as well as disaster relief planning for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in El Salvador (2001) and Panama (2005). She returned to the Ministry of Social Development in 2006 as a specialist in emergencies, reaching the position of Technical Coordinator of Direct Social Assistance for the Secretariat of Territories in February 2009; she was promoted in March 2010 to National Director of Critical Care at the same undersecretariat. Rodr√≠guez remained in that position until March 2012, when she was appointed Secretary of Citizen Participation for the Secretariat of Security by the newly appointed Security Secretary Sergio Berni. She was appointed Secretary of Military Emergency Assistance Coordination in May 2013, and in December of that year was nominated by President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner as Minister of Security. As Security Minister, Rodr√≠guez refocused the nation's drug policy by prioritizing illegal drug trade abatement over suppressing possession as had been the case in Argentina for decades. She stated during her nomination process that \\"the war on drugs has failed at a global level\\" and in July 2014 affirmed that the decriminalization of drug use in Argentina should be debated in the near future.

In May‚ÄìJune 1332, an Aydinid Turkish fleet of 380 ships under Umur Bey attacked Negroponte. Zeno bought them off with a large tribute. On 18 July 1332, Doge Francesco Dandolo charged Zeno and Pietro da Canale with arranging an anti-Turkish alliance. By the end of the year the Naval League, \\"a union, society and league for the discomfiture of the Turks and the defence of the true faith\\", had been formally constituted. In 1334 Zeno took command of the league's fleet of twenty galleys and on 14 September defeated the large fleet of Yakhshi, emir of Karasi, off Adramyttion. In September 1343, the Venetian Grand Council elected Zeno captain of the flotilla of five galleys which it was sending to assist the crusade against Aydinid-held Smyrna. Although the crusade was a great naval success and Smyrna was taken, Zeno was killed by Umur Bey's forces in an ambush while he and the other crusader leaders, including Henry of Asti, were attempting to celebrate a mass in a church in the no-man's-land between the battle lines.

Numismatic evidence suggests he was a Christian and he probably ruled in Northern England around the year 900. Discovery In 2011 a hoard of coins and jewellery was discovered near Silverdale, Lancashire, England. One of the coins discovered in this hoard carries the name on one side, and the letters (an abbreviation of ) on the other. translates as \\"the Lord and King\\". Officials of the British Museum have said the inscription Airdeconut might be a rendering of the Norse name Harthacnut. Experts from the museum have identified that the coin's design relates to coins of the kings Siefredus and Cnut (Sigfro√∞r and Kn√∫tr in Old Norse), who ruled the Viking kingdom of Northumbria jointly between 895 and 905. The coin is also significant since it suggests Airdeconut was a Christian - the reverse inscription () is arranged in a cross. This coin is the only piece of evidence for the existence of a ruler of Northumbria by the name of Harthacnut. According to Dr Gareth Williams, curator of early medieval coins at the British Museum, the discovery of the existence of Airdeconut represents the first new Medieval king in England discovered for over fifty years and the first previously-unknown Norse king discovered since 1840. Historical background It is likely that Airdeconut was one of several kings who shared power in Viking Northumbria at the start of the tenth century. The period was one of political instability - the ruling Vikings of Dublin were expelled in 902 and some of them came to England.Robin et al., p. 33 Several of these later reigned over Northumbria as kings in York.Cannon and Hargreaves, p. 63-68 There was much conflict between the Anglo-Saxons of Mercia and Wessex and the Vikings of Northumbria in this period. It culminated in the Battle of Tettenhall in 910 when a combined Wessexian-Mercian army dealt a decisive defeat to a Viking army raiding in Mercia, killing several northern kings including Eowils and Halfdan.Cannon and Hargreaves, p. 65Downham, pp. 87-89 Notes References Citations Sources Monarchs of Jorvik Viking warriors 10th-century English monarchs ","title":"Airdeconut"},{"id":"46601428","text":"Onitsha Laquis Shaw (born July 16, 1980), who goes by the stage name Onitsha, is an American gospel musician.

Dating The work dates apparently to c.300 B.C.Rotman Institute of Philosophy Western University [Retrieved 2015-05-04] Title The work is known variously as Aristoxenou (or Aristoxenoy) Armonika (or Harmonika) Stoicheia i.e. Aristoxenou Armonika Stoicheia, Aristoxenou Harmonika Stoicheia etc. All of these translate as The Harmonics of Aristoxenus.

Subject Historical context The Elements is held to be the work founding a tradition of the study of music based on practice, which is, to understand music by study to the ear. Musicology as a discipline achieved nascency with the systematic study undertaken in the work, which treated music independently of those prior studies which held it in a position of something purely and only in relation to an understanding of the kosmos. In-as-much, the Elements is the first and earliest work on music in the classical Greek tradition. Earliest considerations arose within the Pythagorean school c.500 and thinking dwelled on the mathematical nature of harmonia. Aristotle, whose Peripatetic school Aristoxenus belonged to, addressed the subject in his work On the Soul. Dewhitt thinks Aristoxenus treatment of the subject was essentially to attempt to describe and locate the elements of the soul, and provide mathematical proofs for these. Aristoxenus is thought contrary to the position of the Pythagoreans, he favoured an intellectual treatment of the subject which Aristotle had set out in his work, which is the exercise of inductive logic with attention to empirical evidence.Sophie Gibson - Aristoxenus of Tarentum and the Birth of Musicology (p.6) Routledge, 8 Apr 2014 Studies in Classics [Retrieved 2015-05-03](p.254) AMS Studies in Music Series Aristoxenus is thought the first to consider music in this respect, as a separate subject, due to this work.Lilian Voudouri Description The work is a theoretical treatise concerned with harmony and harmonics, and thus pertains to a burgeoning theory of euphonics. The study of harmonics is especially concerned with treating melody in order to find its components (the Greek word for melody is ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒøœÇ).(additionally using American Heritage¬Æ Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition at thefreedictionary.com) In the first sentence of the treatise Aristoxenus identifies Harmony as belonging under the general scope of the study of the science of Melody. Aristoxenus considers notes to fall along a continuum available to auditory perception. Aristoxenus identified the three tetrachords in the treatise as diatonic, the chromatic, and the enharmonic.Cristiano M.L. Forster - Musical Mathematics : on the art and science of acoustic instruments CHAPTER 10: WESTERN TUNING THEORY AND PRACTICE Chrysalis Foundation [Retrieved 2015-05-04] The general considered attitude of Aristoxenus was to attempt an empirical study based therefore upon observation. In-as-much his writing contains criticisms of predecessing appreciations and attitudes, of the Pythagorean and harmonikoi, on the problems of sound percptable as music.

Cranch was born in Washington, D.C., the third son of judge William Cranch; his younger brother was the poet and painter Christopher Pearse Cranch, and his elder brother Edward was also an artist. Like Christopher, he was a graduate of Columbian College; at his commencement in 1826 he read a poem of his own composition, \\"Painting\\", suggesting that he had already determined on his future career. William Dunlap claimed that he studied with Chester Harding, Charles Bird King, and Thomas Sully, though he provided no details; this would be unsurprising, however, as all three artists had been active in Washington before 1829, in which year Cranch first advertised his services as a portraitist. Cranch traveled to Italy in 1830, bearing a letter of introduction from John Quincy Adams, a cousin, to Charles R. Leslie. He spent four years there, mainly in Florence and Venice, becoming friends with Hiram Powers and associating with visiting Americans, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson. He studied the work of the Old Masters and continued to paint, creating portraits, genre scenes, and depictions of scenes from Shakespeare. Traveling companions during his time in Italy included Henry and Horatio Greenough and Thomas Cole; other friends from his career included Charles Lanman and John Mix Stanley. Cranch returned to the United States in 1834 and settled in New York City, but did not show in an annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design until 1838. In 1839 he became a Swedenborgian. That year he showed three works in the annual exhibition; these were a portrait of a child, a study of an old man \\"painted at Rome\\", and The Valley of the Shadow of Death. This last, based on the 23rd Psalm and meant as an inspirational work, received scant notice, and the one reviewer that did pay it mind wrote derisively of its composition. After apparently working in North Carolina briefly, Cranch traveled to Cincinnati in the autumn of 1839, and soon became active in the local art community; he served as president of the Fine Arts Section of the Hamilton County Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, at whose exhibition in 1842 he showed a portrait of Charles Dickens, then visiting the United States. He married Charlotte Davis Appleton in 1845 and moved to Boston; in 1846 he exhibited at the Boston Athenaeum. At this point in his career he spent some time in Washington again, where he shared studio space with George Caleb Bingham. He returned to New York in 1848, and kept a studio in the New York University Building from 1849 to 1852. The following year he began sharing a space at 806 Broadway with his brother Christopher, remaining there until 1854; he exhibited at the National Academy during both of the years in question, and was named an associate in 1853. Nevertheless, he moved again, back to Washington, in 1855. There he soon became involved with the Washington Art Association, then newly formed, for which organization he served as director and, later, corresponding secretary. He was also active, along with William Wilson Corcoran and George Peter Alexander Healy, in attempts to set up a national gallery and school of art in Washington. In 1858 he exhibited with the National Academy one last time, again The Valley of the Shadow of Death; that was also the last year in which the Washington city directory showed him as an artist, as from then until he left the city he was listed as \\"postal clerk\\" in the rolls. He left Washington in 1878 and disappears from the record until 1885, when he is listed as a portraitist in Urbana, Ohio, where his son-in-law was serving as president of Urbana University. He died in Urbana, and was memorialized by the Academy on January 12, 1891. He is buried at Oakdale Cemetery in Urbana. A self-portrait by Cranch is today in the collection of the National Academy. His papers, including a journal copied by his wife Charlotte from his original, are currently in the Archives of American Art. At his death, she donated many of his prints to the Academy, while engravings he owned of Renaissance art were presented to the Smithsonian Institution and are today part of the graphic arts collection of the National Museum of American History. Several of his drawings are owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A portrait of his father hangs in the Ceremonial Courtroom of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington. An 1830 portrait of John Quincy Adams was destroyed in the 1851 fire at the Library of Congress; he painted Adams on three other occasions as well.

She is a Democratic former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 87. Without opposition, she won a special election on October 4, 2013, to finish the term of fellow Democrat Girod Jackson III. He resigned due to charges of tax evasion; he was convicted. She lost the Democratic primary for that seat in October 2015. Before entering politics, Woodruff had previously served as an assistant district attorney in Jefferson Parish, and as a special education teacher. Biography Woodruff received a Bachelor of Business Administration from Louisiana State University and a Juris Doctorate from the historically black Southern University Law Center, both in Baton Rouge. She taught special education for some time before getting her law degree. After passing the bar, Woodruff served as an assistant district attorney for Jefferson Parish. Representative Woodruff was a member of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, the Women's Caucus, and the Democratic Caucus. She sat on the following House committees: (1) Administration of Criminal Justice, (2) Commerce, and (3) the Municipal, Parochial and Cultural Affairs. She resides in Harvey, but her office is in Terrytown. In 2014, the conservative Louisiana Family Forum scored Woodruff 33 percent. She was ranked that year 80 percent by Louisiana Right to Life even though she was one of five representatives to vote against the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics. She ranked 58 percent from the Louisiana Association of Educators. Woodruff co-sponsored but did not vote on final passage in 2014 on the matter of extending the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. She also did not vote on the question of forbidding the transportation of dogs in open truck beds on interstate highways. She voted to repeal the anti-sodomy laws; the measure failed in the House, 27-67. She voted to permit concealed carry of weapons in restaurants that serve alcoholic beverages. She voted against the requirement that companies must give public notice of proposed hydraulic fracking. Woodruff lost her bid for a full term in the House in the primary election held on October 24, 2015. She was unseated by Democrat, Rodney Lyons, who polled 2,883 votes (58.6 percent) to Woodruff's 2,034 (41.4 percent). A Baton Rouge Advocate study found that Woodruff has in recent years personally voted in fewer than half of the elections held in Orleans Parish.

Its membership includes ports from non-member states of the European Union which are admitted under observer status. The headquarters of ESPO are in Brussels and include a General Assembly, an Executive Committee and 8 special committees. The ESPO represents the interests of the seaports of the European Union. ESPO represents over 98 percent of the seaports of the European Union, and has direct communication with 500 European ports. Origins The European Commission created the Port Working Group in 1974 with membership consisting of delegates from the port authorities of the major ports of Europe. The PWG process culminated in 1993 with the founding of the ESPO. ESPO functions as an independent organisation which lobbies for the interests of its member port authorities. Ferdinand Suykens, former director- general of the port of Antwerp, became the first chairman of ESPO. Governance The highest body in the organisation is the General Assembly which consists of three members from each member state. It is responsible for creating policy based on the recommendations of the technical committees and convenes twice a year at a minimum. The Executive committee consists of a chairperson, two vice chairmen and two members of the General Assembly which are chosen to serve on the committee. The Executive committee is responsible for liaising with the European Commission and the other European institutions. The technical committees include the transport committee, the marine committee and the environment committee. Environment In 2003 the ESPO published an environmental code of practice regulating environmental practices amongst its member port authorities. The ESPO-developed Environmental Code of Practice is used in conjunction with the Ports Environmental Review System (PERS) to develop policy, management and performance standards compliant with the environmental code. PERS was developed as part of the mandate of the ESPO- created ECOPORTS project. Conferences ESPO organises annual Port conferences.

Soul tax  In 1725, a tax policy was created by Czar Peter the Great called the \\"soul tax\\". Land was awarded based on the number of factors or \\"economic units\\" a household had: this could include a 'tyaglo' (man and wife pair), 'soul' (adult male), 'worker' (adult male or female), or 'eater' (household member of any age). Before 1861, the tyaglo tended to be only on private estates and the 'soul' on state land. The idea continued to grow after the serfs were freed from the land, but an adult male counted for two souls. These ideas were very similar, and a Russian male mainly looked for a partner that could not only work in the fields, but help the household with fiscal obligations as well. The \\"soul tax\\" applied to alcohol and salt, and also included a head tax on Russian men. This created an issue because most of the consumers of salt and alcohol were among the peasantry. Therefore, petty merchants were directly affected by both forms of the tax, whereas the higher classes in the Russian economic ladder were untouched by the indirect tax and only had to worry about the head tax. In 1725, half of state revenues came from the soul tax, although a century later that number dropped to 30 percent. By 1856, the alcohol taxes outweighed the direct tax, by 36 percent to 20 percent of revenues. Due to a financial crisis in the 1870s, peasants were forced to pay higher taxes. Clergy and nobles were also taxed in order to close the deficit, leading the government to reform their policies. On May 26, 1870 the Committee of Ministers recommended printing the commission's proposal and distributing it to the local governors, who would then show it to their respective zemstva (local governments instituted during the great liberal reforms by Alexander II of Russia) for consideration. On June 10 of that year, Alexander II confirmed this recommendation; two days later a proposal was sent to the governors along with a circular from the Minister of Finance. During the preceding three years, peasants had paid an average of 286,000 rubles in state taxes for local needs versus 440,000 rubles for the new approach, more than a 50 percent increase.  Zemstvo Congress of 1871  Various proposals circulated in the zemstvo committees, trying to frame appropriate responses to the central government's taxation plan. * The Tambov commission favored property taxes on land and homes plus a per capita assessment on adult workers. * Committees in other provinces gravitated toward a graduated income tax to be levied on the entire population, while still other committees tried to combine income taxes on the merchants and other targets on the peasants and nobility, so as to reduce the strain on peasant merchants that had existed under the old tax reforms.  The Imperial Decision  The congress lasted three days, from March 15 to 17, 1871, and the government dropped its proposal to replace the soul tax with other assessments. Although it was not completely eliminated until 1887 under other economic circumstances, the idea of income tax gained favor in the central government.

He was most recently a member of the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He attended West Point High School in Mississippi. He played collegiate football for two seasons at East Mississippi Community College before enrolling at Mississippi State for two more years.  College career  Cox was a reserve cornerback in 2013 season with Mississippi, in which he recorded 31 tackles and an interception in the Bulldog's overtime Egg Bowl victory over Ole Miss. Cox was the starting safety for the Bulldogs in 2014. He did not play in the final three games after being arrested for burglary and domestic violence. The charge was dropped when Cox plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge of trespassing with the domestic violence charge being dropped at victim's request.  Professional career   Kansas City Chiefs  Cox went undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft, but signed a free agent contract with the Kansas City Chiefs soon after.  Saskatchewan Roughriders  About 10 months after his release by the Chiefs Cox signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in May 2016. In his first year in the CFL Cox played in 15 games contributing 42 tackles, 2 special teams tackles, 4 interceptions and 1 forced fumble. He missed the final 3 games of the season with an undisclosed injury. For his contributions he was named the team's Rookie of the Year. Following the season, on December 8, 2016, Cox and the Roughriders agreed to a 2-year contract extension, keeping him with the Riders through 2018. In the off-season, on April 19, 2017, news broke that Cox had been involved in an incident involving domestic violence. In response the Riders announced that they had released Cox, and CFL commissioner Jeffrey Orridge stated that the league would not allow any other CFL team to sign him. On May 29, 2017 the provincial court of Saskatchewan determined that Cox was found not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. Despite this, the CFL has stated that it will not allow Cox to play in the league, and the Riders stated that they would not welcome him back even if he was allowed to play by the CFL administration.

A mushroom stand at a Greenmarket farmers' market Greenmarket farmers market aims to encourage regional agriculture by allowing small family farms to sell their locally grown fruits, vegetables, flowers, dairy and other products, so that people in New York of all incomes and in all parts, have access to the fresh, nutritious, provincial, affordable and sustainable goods. GrownNYC's network, Greenmarket Co., has customers that range from Michelin-starred restaurants, popular food retailers to family-run bodegas, senior centers and soap kitchens; and their sources are not only from small to mid sized farms in Northeast region of New York State and New York City but also from farms in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New England, providing New Yorkers with a bountiful and diverse array of fresh foods. One well-known farmer's market in New York is the Union Square Greenmarket which was founded in 1976, held year-round on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays with changing vendors on different days. The number of regional farmers, fishers, and bakers go as high as 140 during the most popular seasons, when the market is visited by food-enthusiast New Yorkers.

The market is situated at the city‚Äôs one of the most vibrant locations and allows about 60,000 people to shop, taste and tour while meeting with farmers History The process of creating a farmers market in New York City was very difficult and came with many hurdles. There are many organizations that needed to be consulted with in order to have made this possible: community boards, zoning committees, local merchants, the office of the Mayor of New York City and more.The New Yorker. \\"A Reporter at Large: Giving Good Weight\\". p. 51 The first farmers market in New York City was at 59th Street and Second Avenue and opened Saturday, July 17, 1976, and it is conceived by Barry Benepe, an urban planner who grew up in a small family farm in Maryland .Benepe, Barry. \\"Greenmarket: The Rebirth of Farmers Markets in New York City\\". The Council on the Environment of New York City: NY, NY. p. 5 In early 1976, Barry Benepe did a written proposal to finance New York City's first Greenmarket. Barry was an architect for the city government and Orange County, New York when he came up with the idea of a city greenmarket to solve the problem of loss of farmland in the metropolitan area because small farmers could not compete with large-scale commercial farms anymore and they had begun to sell their land to real estate developers. Due to loss of farmland the food being produced on the small regional farms was not making it into New York City causing a lack of fresh, decent food in the city.The New Yorker. \\"A Reporter at Large: Giving Good Weight\\". p. 51 The problem is further explained in \\"The Cornucopia Project\\" that details how from 1960 to 1980 the number of farms decreased by 28 percent and the land in farms by 19.5%.Messing, Patricia(1981). \\"The Cornucopia Project The New York State Food System: Growing Closer to Home.\\" The Cornucopia Project of Rodale Press: Emmaus, PA. Barry became the project director of the Greenmarket for the Council on the Environment of New York City (now GrowNYC) when they got involved in implementing his idea of the first city greenmarket. The following organizations donated to Barry's idea: America the Beautiful Fund gave $800, the J.M. Kaplan Fund gave $10,000, the Fund for the City of New York gave $5,000 the Vincent Astor Foundation gave $10,000 and other public officials including Consumer Affairs Commissioner Elinor Guggenheim.Benepe, Barry. \\"Greenmarket: The Rebirth of Farmers Markets in New York City\\". The Council on the Environment of New York City: NY, NY. p. 6 On July 17, seven farmers from \\"Long Island, New Jersey and upstate New York\\" participated in selling at the first greenmarket which quickly became successful. New York City Department of City Planning proposed to open a second farmers market at Union Square and a third one in Brooklyn. The Union Square Market opened on August 30, 1976 and the Brooklyn Farmers Market opened on September 1. \\"Site ownership affected the total cost, while the Brooklyn site required a monthly rental fee, the two publicly owned sites in Manhattan were free, but required long, difficult, costly regulations\\".Benepe, Barry. \\"Greenmarket: The Rebirth of Farmers Markets in New York City\\". The Council on the Environment of New York City: NY, NY. p. 13 In Brooklyn the site owner was the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Biography  Orly Azoulay was born in Rishon Lezion in Israel. She began her career in journalism during her service in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) as a reporter during the Yom Kippur War. After her release from the army, she joined Yedioth Ahronoth and was its correspondent in Hasharon and Netanya. During this time, she wrote many articles about crime in Netanya. Azoulay was one of the only journalists prosecuted for judicial offenses. In 1978, she published a favorable article about a convicted criminal two days before the verdict. Azoulay was convicted under article 41 of the law and was imposed a fine. In 1981 the district court dismissed the appeal. In 1993, she moved to Paris as a correspondent for Yedioth Ahronoth. In this position, she covered peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. In 1996, Azoulay went to Israel to cover the elections and then she went to Washington as a correspondent for a U.S. newspaper. She covered peace conferences including the Wye River Summit, the 2000 Camp David Summit and the Shepherdstown Summit. She has reported on the \\"Axis of Evil\\" from Iran, Iraq and North Korea. She was the first Israeli journalist commissioned to King's Palace in Riyadh and covered the Arab League summit. The Saudi government initially declined to grant her a visa, on the grounds that Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel, but reversed the decision after direct orders from the Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal following a phone call from Ban Ki-moon.The Muslim World League Journal, Volume 35, page 11, Press and Publications Department, Muslim World League, 2007. She has reported from areas of tension around the world including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, Qatar and on Hezbollah in Beirut. 2015 trip to Iran In March 2015, Orly Azoulay visited Iran. This was the first documented trip of an Israeli journalist to Iran, although Azoulay reports that she has visited Iran several times previously. She visited Iranian Jewish communities and synagogues in Tehran and Isfahan. She further visited the Tomb of Esther and Mordechai in Hamedan. In her article about the trip, Azoulay reported that she traveled to Iran with an American passport. However Iranian authorities realized that she had Israeli citizenship because she was born in Israel. Subsequently she was only fingerprinted and was allowed to enter the country and travel freely within the duration of her visit. She spent two weeks in Iran and posted several photos of the trip.

Distributive numbers  singly  doubly  triply - ! Multipliers  single  double  triple } In linguistics, a distributive numeral, or distributive number word, is a word that answers \\"how many times each?\\" or \\"how many at a time?\\", such as singly or doubly. They are contrasted with multipliers. In English, this part of speech is rarely used and much less recognized than cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers, but it is clearly distinguished and commonly used in Latin and several Romance languages, such as Romanian. English In English distinct distributive numerals exist, such as singly, doubly, and triply, and are derived from the corresponding multiplier (of Latin origin, via French) by suffixing -y (reduction of Middle English -lely > -ly). However, this is more commonly expressed periphrastically, such as \\"one by one\\", \\"two by two\\"; \\"one at a time\\", \\"two at a time\\"; \\"one of each\\", \\"two of each\\"; \\"in twos\\", \\"in threes\\"; or using a counter word as in \\"in groups of two\\" or \\"two pieces to a ...\\". Examples include \\"Please get off the bus one by one so no-one falls.\\", \\"She jumped up the steps two at a time.\\", \\"Students worked in the lab in twos and threes.\\", \\"Students worked in groups of two and three.\\", and \\"Students worked two people to a team.\\" The suffixes -some (as in twosome, threesome) and -fold (as in two-fold, three-fold) are also used, though also relatively infrequently. For musical groups solo, duo, trio, quartet, etc. are commonly used, and pair is used for a group of two. A conspicuous use of distributive numbers is in arity or adicity, to indicate how many parameters a function takes. Most commonly this uses Latin distributive numbers and -ary, as in unary, binary, ternary, but sometimes Greek numbers are used instead, with -adic, as in monadic, dyadic, triadic. Other languages Georgian, Latin, and Romanian are notable languages with distributive numerals; see Romanian distributive numbers. In Japanese numerals, distributive forms are formed regularly from a cardinal number, a counter word, and the suffix , as in . In Turkish, one of the -ar/-er suffixes (chosen according to vowel harmony) are added to the end of a cardinal numeral, as in \\"birer\\" (one of each) and \\"dokuzar\\" (nine of each). If the numeral ends with a vowel, a letter ≈ü comes to the middle; as in \\"iki≈üer\\" (two of each) and \\"altƒ±≈üar\\" (six of each).

The park borders the coast and encompasses 534 hectares stretching from the residential suburbs of Merewether to Dudley within the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie Local Government Areas.Department of Climate Change and Water (NSW). (2010). Glenrock State Conservation Area Plan of Management. Office of Environment and Heritage. NSW Government. Available from http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/parkmanagement/GlenrockSCA.htm). (Retrieved on 5 May 2015). Glenrock State Conservation Area is significant as it contains a large number of important remnant vegetation communities, contains a number of heritage sites, and is used by a wide variety of user groups. The park contains many cultural records, both Aboriginal and European, and is located within the Awabakal Local Aboriginal Land Council area. Overview The park has many features including significant natural and landscape values, cultural heritage values (Aboriginal and European), recreational and tourism uses, and is important for research and education. Glenrock Lagoon, which is fed by Flaggy Creek, is located within the park and connects to Burwood Beach and the ocean through a small tidal channel. The park is legislated as a state conservation area under the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 which provides protection to conserve biodiversity, maintain ecosystem functions, and conserve places and features of cultural value. This protection also allows certain uses to occur whilst having regard to the natural and cultural values of the park, and provide compatible visitor and tourist use. The park is used by a wide number of people and variety of interest groups. It contains a number of walking tracks of various grades, including tracks which are accessible by wheel chair. The Great North Walk traverses through the park. The park is well known for its mountain bike tracks which is allowed on designated tracks in the northern section of the park with horse riding also allowed in the northern section of the park or by permit.Office of Environment and Heritage (NSW). 2012.

Available from http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/~/media/Visitor/Files/PDF/Brochures/glenrock- sca-pdf.ashx. (Retrieved on 5 May 2015). Other uses include hang gliding, fishing, surfing, orienteering and beach related activities. The park has an active Scouts Australia NSW campsite, Glenrock Scout Camp, adjacent to Glenrock Lagoon. Flora The park contains remnant vegetation including many nationally significant vegetation communities, two endangered ecological communities, and five threatened flora species, and is recognised for its flora diversity. The park conserves native vegetation which has largely been removed or significantly degraded throughout the lower Hunter, and also includes a number of regionally significant vegetation communities. A total of twelve vegetation communities have been recorded in the park with eight considered poorly conserved at a national level, and two which are listed under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act as endangered ecological communities. Importantly the park includes some of the last areas containing Permian geology and sediments which are protected within conservation reserves, which explains why the park contains such a high flora diversity. Significant vegetation communities include littoral rainforest (national and state significance), permian coastal clay grassland (national and state significance), permian coastal gully rainforest (regional significance), permian sheltered dry forest (national significance), permian exposed coastal scrub (national significance), and permian coastal clay Melaleuca scrub (national significance). The park contains five of the last seven known pockets of Littoral Rainforest in the lower Hunter, which is nationally listed as a critically endangered ecological community and as an endangered ecological community under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

Endangered plants protected inside the park include the rough double tail (Dirius praecox), magneta lilly pilly (Syzygium paniculatum), white-flowered wax plant (Cynanchum elegans), black- eyed susan (Tetratheca juncea) and heath wrinklewort (Rutidosis heterogama). These plants are all listed as threatened species under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and listed as nationally threatened under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The status of the park as a conservation area means these important species have some level of protection. This is especially important for some species such as Tetratheca juncea which is found in woodland and heath communities but now has a contracted north south range of 110 km, largely due to clearing for urban development, with historic southern populations around Sydney now extinct.Gross, C. L., F. V. Bartier and D. R. Mulligan. 2003. Floral structure, breeding system and fruit-set in the threatened sub-shrub Tetratheca juncea Smith (Tremandraceae). Annals of Botany 92: 771-777. The rainforest tree Syzygium paniculatum which is found in the park, is found only within the critically endangered littoral rainforests of NSW in disjunct populations often of less than 20 individuals.Thurlby, K. A. G., P. G. Wilson, W. B. Sherwin, C. Connelly and M. Rossetto. 2012. Reproductive bet-hedging in a rare yet widespread rainforest tree, Syzygium paniculatum (Myrtaceae). Austral Ecology 37: 936-944. Despite pressures from clearing for urban development, low population numbers and low genetic diversity, Syzygium paniculatum has been found to be persisting and producing viable and dispersible seed thereby making protected areas where this species exist important for the preservation of this species. Fauna Glenrock State Conservation area contains habitat for a wide variety of animal species with 140 species of bird having been recorded in or nearby to the park including many notable threatened species such as the powerful owl (Ninox strenua), masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae), turquoise parrot (Neophema pulchella), regent honeyeater (Xanthomyza phrygia) and swift parrot (Lathamus discolour). These species are listed as vulnerable under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 except for the regent honeyeater (Xanthomyza phrygia) and swift parrot (Lathamus discolour) which are listed as endangered and also listed under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The swift parrot (Lathamus discolour) is a nationally significant migratory bird which is also listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 2014. Lathamus discolour (Swift Parrot). IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Available from http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/22685219/0 (Retrieved on 14 May 1015). The swift parrot only breeds in Tasmania between September and January and migrates to mainland Australia for wintering before returning to Tasmania in early spring.Webb, M. H., M. C. Holdsworth and J. Webb. 2012. Nesting requirements of the endangered Swift Parrot (Lathamus discolour). Emu 112:181-188. The swift parrot disperses during winter through the landscape in a highly irregular and unpredictable manner based on availability of suitable food and habitat areas.Heinsohn, R., M. Webb, R. Lacy, A. Terauds, R. Alderman, and D. Stojanovic. 2015. A severe predator-induced population decline predicted for endangered, migratory swift parrots (Lathamus discolour). Biological Conservation 186:75-82. Protected areas such as Glenrock State Conservation Area are important for the swift parrot as the species breeding and wintering habitats have been substantially lost or altered, and while winter foraging is widespread across Tasmania, Victoria, NSW and into Queensland, the coastal areas of NSW are known to be used especially during periods of drought Saunders, D. and R.

Reptiles recorded in the park include the diamond python (Morelia spilotes var. spilotes), the death adder (Acanthophis antarticus), tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis), and the land mullet (Ergenia major). Mammals which have been found in the park include the short beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), long nosed bandicoot (Parameles nasuta), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), and the common dunnart (Sminthopsis murina). Threatened mammal species recorded in the park include the common bent wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii), little bent wing bat (Miniopterus australis), the nationally threatened grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), and squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis). The park is important for locally present species with large home ranges such as the threatened powerful owl (Ninox strenua) and grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus). The powerful owl has a large home range in excess of 1500 hectares and requires mature trees (Eucalypts) for roosting and with habitat which supports sufficient preySoderquist, T. and D. Gibbons. 2007. Home range of the Powerful Owl (Ninox strenua) in dry sclerophyll forest. Emu 107:177-184. The nationally vulnerable grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), which is endemic to coastal eastern Australia, also requires a large home range and forages predominantly within 20 kilometres from camps however is known to forage up to 50 kilometres.Tidemann, C. R. and J. E. Nelson. 2004. Long-distance movements of the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus). Journal of Zoology 263:141-146. The urban area around the park has been significantly altered and disturbed with few surrounding large sized bush blocks making Glenrock State Conservation Area an important habitat and refuge for a wide variety of species, such as the Powerful Owl and Grey Headed Flying Fox, which require large home range areas containing Eucalyptus forest. Cultural heritage Glenrock State Conservation Area is part of Awabakal Country and the park is believed to have been inhabited since the Pleistocene period. The land and landscape within the park is significant to the Awabakal and other Aboriginal people with many sites recorded including middens, axe grinding groove sites, camp sites and a quarry.Griffin nrm. 2003. Glenrock Lagoon Cultural Landscape ‚Äì Conservation Management and Cultural Tourism Plan. Vol 1 and 2. Report to NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. Available from http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/parkmanagement/GlenrockSCAGlenrockLagoonCmp.htm (Retrieved on 4 May 2015). European sites include Australia‚Äôs first road/tram tunnel (c1846), Australia‚Äôs first railway tunnels (c1861 and 1862), remains of Australia‚Äôs first commissioned copper smelter (c1851), remains of Burwood Colliery and a coastal railway. The early coal mining sites within the park are listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. There are over 145 known cultural sites recorded throughout the park. Environmental threats Glenrock State Conservation Area has been affected by a range of land use practices which have caused damage and include habitat disturbance and fragmentation, past mining and other resource use, development by utilities, past and present recreational activities. These have manifested in a number of threats that exist for the park including soil erosion from poorly designed easements and trails, impacts to water quality from urban stormwater and effluent surcharges from a sewerage pipeline, introduced plants and animals, fire management and climate change. An indicator of the pressures these threats can have is evident in the presence of bell miner associated dieback which is known to occur in several locations throughout the park. While the specific factors that cause bell miner associated dieback are unclear, it is considered to be related to stress on the forest community and to such things as forest disturbance, changes in tree stand structure, an absence of regular burning, development of a dense understory, increase in foliar nutrients, infestation of tree crowns by psyllids, and colonisation by the bell miner.Florence, R. 2005. Bell miner associated dieback: an ecological perspective. Australian Forestry 68:263-266. A bush regeneration plan is being implemented in the park to address many of the impacts that contribute to bell miner associated dieback. Fire management is an important aspect of park management. The unnatural exclusion of fire changes soils and nutrient processes which creates an unfavourable environment for eucalypts, creating a more favourable environment for arbivores and competitors.Jurskis, V. 2005. Decline of eucalypt forests as a consequence of unnatural fire regimes. Australian Forestry 68:257-262 A fire management plan exists for the park which shows that large areas of the park are classified as being either underburnt or almost underburnt and below thresholds required for some of the different vegetation types, predominantly the dry sclerophyll forest.National Parks and Wildlife Service. 2010. Glenrock State Conservation Area and Awabakal Nature Reserve Fire Management Strategy. National Parks and Wildlife Service. Available from http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/firemanagement/AwabakalNRfms.htm (Retrieved on 8 May 2015). An appropriate fire strategy can maintain forest health and is also likely to assist in limiting the effects of bell miner associated dieback. A number of weed species exist in the park including bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata), lantana (Lantana camara) and blackberry (Rubis fruticosus), all of which are listed on the Noxious Weeds Act 1993. Bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata) is a major environmental weed along the south eastern coast of Australia within littoral habitats and is of particular concern in Glenrock State Conservation Area as it is widespread and is affecting a number of the endangered ecological communities and threatened species. This weed is listed as a key threatening process under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and accordingly the parks bush regeneration plan and pest management strategy aims to target the management of this species. Management Glenrock State Conservation Area is managed by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. A sewage treatment plant is located on designated land within the park boundaries which is owned and operated by Hunter Water Corporation. Electricity easements also exist throughout the park containing transmission lines which are managed by Energy Australia. A Conservation Management Plan and Cultural Tourism Plan for the northern section of the park was completed in 2003 which formed an important input into the development of a Plan of Management which was adopted in September 2010. The Glenrock State Conservation Area Plan of Management (2010), which was prepared by the NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change outlines the attributes of the park, management priorities, visitor opportunities and education, research and monitoring, and relevant operational management issues. Management priorities focus on managing impacts from the various threats to the park, impacts from the wide variety of activities that occur in the park, and protection of the conservation and cultural values. Newcastle Council has prepared a Coastline Management Plan which includes the Burwood Beach section of the park and identifies the collaborative approach required to manage the park given the diverse number of stakeholders who have an interest.Umwelt Environmental Consultants. 2003.

They are contrasted with distributive numbers. In English, this part of speech is relatively marginal, and less recognized than cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers. English In English native multipliers exist, formed by the suffix -fold, as in onefold, twofold, threefold. However, these have largely been replaced by single, double, and triple, which are of Latin origin, via French. They have a corresponding distributive number formed by suffixing -y (reduction of Middle English -lely > -ly), as in singly. However, the series is primarily used for the first few numbers; quadruple and quintuple are less common, and hextuple and above are quite rare. For larger multiples a cardinal number and a counter are used instead, such as \\"five portions\\" or \\"a portion five times the normal size\\" instead of \\"a quintuple portion\\". In espresso servings, the Italian solo, doppio, and triplo are sometimes used, with doppio being most common.

They used the Szeptycki coat of arms. The family was related to a number of other noble families, such as the Wi≈õniowiecki family, the Led√≥chowski family and the Fredro family. The family history dates to the 15th century in the Ruthenian Voivodeship of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with a document from 1469, issued by King of Poland, Casimir Jagiellon, confirming the family's right to Szeptyce (today Sheptychi, Ukraine). Originally Eastern Orthodox, some time after 1596 the family joined the Greek Catholic Church following the Union of Brest. From the 16th century, the family's members started to acquire important offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including ecclesiastical, with several advancing to the rank of a bishop in the Greek Catholic Church (bishop Barlaam Szeptycki (d. 1715) was originally a bishop of the Eastern Orthodox rite, before converting to the Greek rite; other Greek rite bishops in the family included Atanazy Antoni Szeptycki (d. 1746), Atanazy Andrzej Szeptycki (d.1779)[http://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/andrzej-szeptycki-h-wlasnego Andrzej Szeptycki and Leon Ludwik Szeptycki (d. 1779).).

He initially graduated from the Greek Army's NCO Academy but eventually he became a regular commissioned officer, and by the end of his military career he had achieved the rank of Major General. Grigoriadis had an eventful military career. From 1907 to 1909 he was posted in Edessa (then still part of the Ottoman Empire) as a secret agent working against Turkish and Bulgarian interests during the Macedonian Struggle; officially, he was principal of Edessa's Greek primary school. He took part in the revolutionary Goudi Coup in 1909, fought in the Balkan Wars and World War I, and sided with the Venizelists during the National Schism. In 1920, after the royalist electoral victory, he was discharged from the Army, but he was recommissioned in 1922 by the 11 September 1922 Revolution, and participated in the Trial of the Six as \\"revolutionary commissioner\\" (public prosecutor). In 1926 he was promoted to Major General, and later that year left the Army for good. Grigoriadis was then involved in politics, being elected senator for Edessa (1929‚Äì1935) for Venizelos's Liberal Party. However, during the late 1930s he increasingly sympathized with the Left. After the German invasion of Greece and the Nazi occupation, Grigoriadis was an active member of the left-wing National Liberation Front (EAM), culminating in his role as Chairman of the \\"National Council\\" that EAM created in 1944 in order to supervise the drafting of a new constitution for post-liberation Greece. Neokosmos Grigoriadis died in 1967. His son, Solon Grigoriadis (1912‚Äì1994), was a respected military writer, historian and journalist. 1879 births 1967 deaths Constantinopolitan Greeks People from Constantinople Vilayet Liberal Party (Greece) politicians Democratic Alignment politicians Members of the Greek Senate Greek MPs 1950‚Äì1951 Hellenic Army generals Greek military personnel of the Macedonian Struggle Greek military personnel of the Balkan Wars Greek military personnel of World War I National Liberation Front (Greece) members ","title":"Neokosmos Grigoriadis"},{"id":"46602138","text":"Colin D.

Since its sixth year in 2013 it has been held at Carson Creek Ranch in Austin, Texas. Inspired by the creative explosion of the 1960s, as well as by festivals such as ATP and Primavera Sound, they set out to create their vision of a music festival. Over the years, this independent festival has grown to an internationally acclaimed, full weekend event that attracts attendees from all over the world. In 2015 Austin Psych Fest was renamed \\"Levitation\\" in honor of Austin's psychedelic rock pioneers The 13th Floor Elevators. The Reverberation Appreciation Society is a creative collective composed of Rob Fitzpatrick, Oswald James, and Christian Bland and Alex Maas of The Black Angels. In addition to the festival in Austin, the group has branched out into other cities beginning in 2013 with Levitation France and in 2015 with Levitation Vancouver and Levitation Chicago. The group also runs The Reverberation Appreciation Society record label and has curated events at Austin's SXSW, The Netherlands' Le Guess Who?, NYC's CMJ and NRMAL in Mexico City.

He played college football at Purdue on a football scholarship. He played with the Dallas Cowboys for the 2015 season; the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 2016 and 2017 seasons; and was signed by the Buffalo Bills for the 2018 season before the team trimmed their roster to meet league regulations. Early years Russell attended Creekview High School, where as a senior defensive lineman he registered 62 tackles (17 for loss) and 5 sacks, while being named second-team All-district. He accepted a scholarship from Purdue University. His best season came as a freshman, playing as a defensive end in a 4-3 defense, registering 11 starts, 33 tackles (4.5 for loss), one sack, 3 forced fumbles and 3 fumbles recovered. The next year, he tallied 13 starts, 37 tackles and 4 sacks. As a junior the team switched to a 3‚Äì4 defense in mid-October and he was moved to the Jack linebacker position, recording 11 starts, 35 tackles (5.5 for loss) and 2 sacks. In his last year he was moved back to defensive end, replacing the graduated Bruce Gaston. He had 44 tackles (6.5 for loss) and 3 sacks, finishing his career as a four-year starter with 149 tackles (25 for loss) and 10 sacks. Professional career Dallas Cowboys Russell was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round (163rd overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft, after dropping because his physical skills didn't match his on-field production. In training camp he was tried at left defensive end and at the three-technique defensive tackle positions. During the season, he appeared in one game and was declared inactive in 11. After being limited with an abdomen strain, he was placed on the injured reserve list on December 2, in order to activate offensive tackle Chaz Green from the reserve/PUP list. In the 2016 training camp, he was given the chance to start after the suspensions to defensive ends DeMarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory. On September 3, he was released after struggling during the preseason games. The next day, he was signed to the Cowboys' practice squad. He was released on September 6. Tampa Bay Buccaneers On September 21, 2016, Russell was signed to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on November 12, and had his first career sack against the Seattle Seahawks. He played in 8 games as a reserve defensive end, collecting 4 tackles and one sack. In 2017, he appeared in 14 games with 7 starts, while registering 17 tackles. He missed the fifth and sixth games with a dislocated left shoulder, which limited him the rest of the year. His 2 sacks came in each of the final two contests. He wasn't re-signed after the season. Buffalo Bills On July 29, 2018, Russell signed with the Buffalo Bills. He was released, with thirty-five other teammates, in September 2018 by the Bills to reach the league‚Äôs 53-man roster limit. He missed the 2018 season due to a shoulder injury. Personal life Following the death of close friend and former teammate Joseph Gilliam in 2018, Russell suffered from a severe bout of depression. He moved to Los Angeles and began writing. In August 2019, he came out publicly as bisexual in an essay for ESPN. He did so to live honestly and without fear of being outed; he also cited the fear of not being able to support his mother and grandfather if he lost his career. At the same time he introduced his boyfriend Corey O‚ÄôBrien, a dancer; they opened Corey & Russ, a YouTube channel; as of June 2020, they have over 15,600 followers. If Russell were to sign with an NFL team, he would be the only athlete in the four American major professional sports leagues (National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League) to openly identify as LGBTQ. A former NFL offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan, who came out as gay after he left the league, said that as of August 2019 every NFL team had at least one closeted gay or bisexual player. Sarah McBride, national Press Secretary for Human Rights Campaign, praised Russell for \\"creating more space and opportunity for young LGBTQ people to dream big and to pursue their goals\\".

He was a member of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) and commander of the 501st (101st) SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Early SS service Westernhagen joined NSDAP in 1929 with membership number 174562, and later the SA. In April 1932, he joined the Allgemeine-SS. He joined the SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe on 1 October 1934 and assigned to a company of the Germania Regiment. In 1936, he took platoon commander training course at Dachau Training Area, where he became acquainted with Jochen Peiper.Parker, Warrior, p. 16 Afterwards Westernhagen was transferred to the Security Service (Sicherheitsdienst or SD). World War II Assigned to SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, Westernhagen took part in the fighting in the Netherlands, Belgium and France in 1940. Afterwards, Westernhagen was transferred back to the Security Service (SD), returning to LSSAH in March 1941. During the Battle of Greece, he served in the staff of the Kampfgruppe Witt, commanded by SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Fritz Witt. On 1 June 1942 Westernhagen became the commander of Leibstandarte Sturmgesch√ºtz (Assault Gun) Battalion. Westernhagen remained on this position until 5 August 1943 when he was appointed to command the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion.  Battle of Kursk  Westernhagen's unit was to operate in the southern sector of the planned operation.Schranck, Prokhorovka, p. 42-55 The Assault Gun Battalion LSSAH commanded by Westernhagen was part of reinforced 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment LSSAH; he sustained a head wound in the first day of the operation, on July 5. Westernhagen was evacuated that day, and later transferred to Berlin for additional surgery. The head injury sustained during the Operation Zitadelle has plagued Westernhagen the rest of his life. Westernhagen was appointed commander of the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion on 19 July 1943. Further treatment of his head wound and subsequent participation in a training course for battalion commanders at the Armored Forces School in Paris delayed his arrival until 13 February 1944.Schneider, Tigers in Combat, p. 205 The 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion was heavily engaged during the Normandy campaign, and lost virtually all its equipment in the retreat across France in August 1944. The remains of the unit were ordered to rest and completely refit with the new Tiger IIs. On 22 September 1944, it was redesignated as the 501st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion.Schneider, Tigers in Combat, p. 213  Battle of Normandy Westernhagen (in camouflage uniform) at a practice in May 1944 near east of Amiens, France On 6 June 1944, the battalion was at Beauvais, north of Paris. On that day in the early morning hours of 0600, it was placed on alert. Between 0200 and 0300 hours on 7 June, the Tiger battalion set off for the invasion front, on its own power, due to the extensive damage to the railway network northwest of Paris.Schneider, Tigers in Normandy, p. 2 Initially, the Tigers drove through Gournay-en-Bray to Les Andelys. The bridge at Les Andelys to cross Seine was badly damaged, the battalion had to move through Paris. In an effective bit of propaganda, the Tigers rolled along the Champs-Elys√©es, passed the Arc de Triomphe to Versailles. March continued on to Falaise through Dreux, Verneuil and Argentan in the following days.Schneider, Tigers in Normandy, p. 5 The entire road march was an arduous and strenuous journey, in the area of Allied air superiority, started from day one, the march was often strafed by Allied fight-bombers and casualties mounted. Tigers could only drive out during the night with single tank movement, that is one tank at a time with lengthy intervals between vehicles up to several hundred meters. The road march was nearly in distance, but took the battalion six days to reach. By the time the battalion has reached its designated assemble area during the night of 12 June 1944, it had suffered total casualties of twenty-seven, including nine killed. The long road march had also caused many mechanical problems and failures to the Tigers, of its theoretical strength of fourteen tanks, the 1st company ended with eight tanks; and the 2nd company, six. The 1st company assembled at Noyers ( northeast of Villers-Bocage); the 2nd company assembled in a defile south of Montbrocq ( northeast of Villers-Bocage); the 3rd company was still held up farther to rear; von Westernhagen's battalion command post was established at Baron-sur-Odon. The battalion was immediately ordered to cover the left flank of the I. SS Panzer Corps, the crews had no rest.Schneider, Tigers in Normandy, p. 4, 11 Battle of Villers-Bocage The wreckage of the British transport column, and an anti-tank gun, that Wittmann engaged. In the days following the Allied D-Day landings of 6 June, both British and Germans regarded control of Caen as vital to the Normandy battle. When a gap has opened up between 352nd Infantry Division and Panzer Lehr Division, the British 7th Armoured Division (Desert Rats) was given the mission to exploit through this gap and encircle Caen from the south-west to form what Montgommery has termed the 'right hook'.Schneider, Tigers in Combat, p. 206 At 08:30 on 13 June 1944, the 22nd Armoured Brigade entered Villers-Bocage. The advancement conducted without additional reconnaissance was a costly mistake for the British as they were oblivious to the presence of 2nd Company, 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. The Company commander, SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Michael Wittmann, engaged the British with a lone Tiger tank first along N175 as he advanced towards Villers-Bocage, and later in the town itself, until his Tiger was immobilized from an antitank gun.Schneider, Tigers in Normandy, p. 19 - 22 The British withdrawal indicated the end of the post D-Day \\"scramble for ground\\" and the start of the a grinding attritional battle for Caen.Hastings, Normandy, p. 166 Westernhagen then went on a convalescent leave to deal with the aftermath of his head wound.  Battle of the Bulge Tiger II tank from the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion passes a column of American GIs taken prisoner day of the Battle of the Bulge. On 21 November 1944, Westernhagen returned to the battalion, now designated as the 501st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. The plan for the Ardennes Offensive was to deliver a powerful blow and to regain the initiative in the West Front.Parker, Ardennes, p. 12 The main attack would be led by the 6th Panzer Army advancing from Monschau to Losheim, crossing the Meuse on both side of Li√®ge and then advance on Antwerp. The advance roads were assigned to the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte and the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend. Leibstandarte was to use Roads D and E, Hitlerjugend Roads A, B and C. The 501st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion was at full strength except for the 4th (Light) Company. Each panzer company possessed 14 Tiger IIs, gave a total strength of 45. However the battalion was plagued with maintenance problems and mechanical breakdowns, it is probable that only around 30-35 Tigers actually participated in the initial advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper.Walden, Tiger, p. 30 Due to the blitz action KG Peiper needed as the spearhead of the offensive, considering the sixty-eight tonne Tigers could reach a speed of only thirty-eight kilometers per hour, and rough terrain and road conditions, the Tiger Battalion were placed to the rear of the march column from the beginning, formed as the rearguard. However, after leaving the hilly section of the offensive zone the Tiger Battalion was to be moved forward and spearhead the breakthrough to the Meuse.Walden, Tiger, p. 29 On 16 December 1944, due to 12th Volksgrenadier's (VG) slow progress in breaking through the American lines thus opening a gap for Route D, the Tiger Battalion just started to roll out from its assembly area at Tondorf. Wessel's 1st Company was in the lead, which brought up from the rear.Cooke, Peiper, p. 30-36 (16 Dec. 1944)Walden, Tigers, p. 30 Panzergruppe Peiper evacuated Stoumont and Cheneux in the early evening hours of 21 December 1944 and withdrew his entire battle group to La Gleize, the small village thus became the center point of the pocket. The breakout began at 0200 hours on 24 December 1944, of the approximately 3000 men of Panzergruppe Peiper, 850 of them who could still walk, including wounded, assembled to begin the breakout. Among them were Westernhagen and other members of the battalion. In the morning hour of 25 December 1944 he and his group has reached the Leibstandarte Division's command post in Wanner after a 33 hours march. Death On 19 March 1945, Westernhagen received an order to leave the battalion and join the officer reserve; SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Heinz Kling assumed command.

He directed Sorum (2001), Blue Swallow (2005), I Am Happy (2009) and My Paparotti (2013). Career Yoon Jong-chan majored in Film at Hanyang University, and upon graduation he joined the crew of Kim Young-bin's No Emergency Exit (1993) as an assistant director. In 1995, Yoon went to the United States to attend Syracuse University, where he earned his MFA in Film Directing. While at Syracuse, he directed three short films about memory and fate, Playback (1996), Memento (1997), and Views (1999), which won numerous awards at film festivals both in Korea and abroad. Yoon returned to Korea in 2001, and first taught in the film department of Hoseo University. He then made his feature directorial debut with Sorum (meaning \\"gooseflesh\\" in Korean). About damaged people living in a dilapidated apartment complex (particularly a taxi driver who has an affair with a battered housewife, played by Kim Myung-min and Jang Jin-young), local critics praised Sorum as a stylish, atmospheric, deeply challenging, and intelligently written horror film. Yoon won Best New Director at the Busan Film Critics Awards and the Baeksang Arts Awards, while Sorum won three awards at Fantasporto, including Best Director for Yoon, Best Actress for Jang, and the Special Jury Prize. For his next film, biopic Blue Swallow (2005), Yoon again cast Jang in the leading role as Park Kyung-won, a real- life Korean pioneering female aviator who lived in the 1920s and 1930s (the film is named after Park's beloved biplane). Yoon proved that he could handle an ambitious, big-budget project, and the () blockbuster had overseas locations in Japan, El Mirage (California), and Changchun (China), included 1,100 CGI-enhanced aerial scenes, and employed 1,000 extras. But the film became mired in controversy when certain conservative internet reporters accused Park of being a pro-Japanese collaborator and alleged that the film had whitewashed its protagonist, to which Yoon responded, \\"I don't have any intention to embellish her or depict her as a independence fighter in my film. I just wanted to show a tragedy of a woman who had to choose her dream over her country.\\" Despite excellent reviews and Park's biographer pointing out factual errors in these accusations, it resulted in the under-performance of Blue Swallow at the box office. Yoon made his first foray into digital filmmaking with I Am Happy, adapted from the novel Mr. Cho Man-deuk by Lee Cheong-jun. He shot the ironically titled romance film on HD for six weeks, and cast Hyun Bin and Lee Bo-young as a megalomania-afflicted patient and his nurse who find more comfort inside a psychiatric ward than their reality outside. I Am Happy was the closing film of the 13th Busan International Film Festival in 2008 and was released in theaters in 2009. In 2013, Han Suk-kyu and Lee Je-hoon starred in Yoon's fourth film My Paparotti, about a troubled teen and his temperamental music teacher, who missed his chance at fame as an opera singer in his youth and sees himself in his new student. It won the Grand Prize at the 27th Fukuoka Asian Film Festival. Personal life Yoon's wife died at the Sampoong Department Store collapse in 1995.

It was discovered on 31 December 2007, by astronomers of the Catalina Sky Survey conducted at the Catalina Station in Arizona, United States.  Orbit and classification  is an Apollo asteroid that crosses the orbit of Earth. Apollo's are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known members. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.60‚Äì2.55 AU once every 2 years (722 days; semi-major axis of 1.58 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.62 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. This makes it also a Mars-crossing asteroid, as it crosses the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU, as well as a Venus-crosser due to its aphelion of less than 0.71 AU. The body's observation arc begins at Catalina with its official discovery observation in December 2007.  Close approaches  has a minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of , which corresponds to 1.83 lunar distances (LD). It has an absolute magnitude of 21.0. This makes it a potentially hazardous asteroid, which are defined as having a MOID of less than and an absolute magnitude brighter than 22. Besides Earth, it also makes close approaches to Venus, Mars and the Moon. On 26 December 2007, five days prior to its discovery observation, it passed Earth at a nominal distance of . On 2 January 2102, it is predicted to flyby Earth at and pass the Moon at a similar distance five hours earlier as well (also see ).  Physical characteristics  The body's spectral type is unknown. Near-Earth asteroids are often of a stony composition.  Diameter and albedo  Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, measures in diameter, for an absolute magnitude of 21.0, and an assumed albedo of 0.20 and 0.057, which represent typical values for stony and carbonaceous asteroids, respectively.

The attackers shot an unarmed Garland Independent School District (GISD) security officer in the ankle. Shortly after opening fire, both attackers were shot and killed by an off-duty Garland police officer. The FBI had been monitoring the two attackers for years and an undercover agent was right behind them when the first shots were fired. The injured security guard filed a lawsuit against the FBI in October 2017, claiming the FBI was partially responsible for his injuries. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack plot, the first time the militant group took credit for an attack in the United States. ISIL's claim of responsibility was not verified, and U.S. officials stated that the attack appears to have been inspired, but not directed, by ISIL. An online ISIL persona run by internet troll Joshua Ryne Goldberg had posted maps to the exhibition, and urged his followers to attack the event. Goldberg pleaded guilty to federal charges in December 2017. His persona was retweeted by one of the attackers on the morning of the attack, and Goldberg claimed responsibility for inciting the attack to multiple news outlets and in his plea agreement. Background Muhammad exhibit and contest The event, which featured images of Muhammad, was advertised as the \\"First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest\\", presented by the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), or Stop Islamization of America. It was organized by the AFDI together with the David Horowitz Freedom Center's Jihad Watch, run by Robert Spencer. A $10,000 award was offered for the winning cartoon, which was selected from among 350 submissions. The prize was awarded to Bosch Fawstin, a former Muslim and a critic of Islam who submitted six drawings, with the text \\"You can't draw me!\\"/\\"That's why I draw you.\\" He was to collect an award of $12,500. Though images of Muhammad are not explicitly banned by the Quran, prominent Islamic views oppose human images, especially those of prophets. Such views have gained ground among certain militant Islamic groups. The event featured speeches by Pamela Geller, president of the AFDI, and Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker and outspoken critic of Islam. Congressmen Keith Ellison and Andr√© Carson had tried unsuccessfully to block Wilders from entering the United States. At the time of the attack, the \\"First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest\\" exhibit was attended by approximately 150 people, although the number was initially estimated at 200. The organizers of the event had paid over $10,000 to a total of forty off-duty police officers and private security guards. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a SWAT team, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) were also brought in for the occasion of any possible incidents. At the time, there was reportedly \\"no immediate credible threat\\" of an attack. Prior to the attack, ISIL had urged followers and sympathizers who were unable to join the fighting in the Syrian Civil War to carry out jihad in their home countries. Approximately three hours prior to the start of the contest, the FBI had alerted the Garland Police Department that a suspected extremist, identified as gunman Elton Simpson, was \\"interested in the event\\" and could show up there. However, FBI officials later clarified they had no reason to believe an actual attack would occur at the contest. Officers later stated that they were not aware of the alert. Location The \\"First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest\\" event was hosted at the Curtis Culwell Center, rented from the Garland Independent School District. The center previously hosted a fundraiser in January called \\"Stand With the Prophet in Honor and Respect\\", which was organized to combat negative stereotypes of Islam. Geller had spearheaded about 1,000 picketers at that event. Before the start of the \\"First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest\\", concerns were expressed by Garland citizens about the center hosting the event due to potential backlash and retaliation, a sentiment that had also been voiced prior to the \\"Stand With the Prophet in Honor and Respect\\" event. However, officials allowed both events to proceed as planned, since the school district was bound by a nondiscriminatory leasing policy. Garland ISD board president Rick Lambert said in January, \\"The Culwell Center is available for rental as long as you comply with the law. Because it is a public facility, the district is not allowed to discriminate based upon viewpoint.\\" Attack Minutes prior to the attack, a man, identified by police as one of the gunmen, posted a tweet with the hashtag #texasattack: \\"May Allah accept us as mujahideen.\\" In his tweet, he said he and an accomplice had pledged allegiance to \\"Amirul Mu'mineen\\", which Paul Cruickshank of CNN said probably referred to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The user also asked his readers to follow Junaid Hussain on Twitter. After the shooting occurred, Hussain tweeted: \\"Allahu Akbar!!!! 2 of our brothers just opened fire\\". Just before the event was set to end at around 7:00p.m., two men wearing body armor and equipped with three rifles, three handguns, and 1,500 rounds of ammunition drove up to a police car that was parked next to a barricade erected in front of the center. Seated inside the police car were Officer Gregory Stevens of the Garland Police Department and an unarmed Garland ISD security guard. The two gunmen got out of their vehicle and fired dozens of rounds at the police car, shooting the Garland ISD security guard. The men were then shot and wounded by Stevens, and eventually killed by SWAT officers. The Garland ISD officer, identified as 58-year-old Bruce Joiner, was shot in the ankle. He was treated at a local hospital and confirmed to be released at 9:00 p.m. Authorities were worried that the suspects' car could contain an incendiary device; as a precaution, several nearby businesses were evacuated. Bomb units from the Garland Police Department, the FBI, the Plano Police Department, and the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport were called to the scene. Police cordoned off a large area and at least three helicopters circled overhead. An officer in SWAT gear took the stage toward the end of the event and told attendees that a shooting had occurred, stating that one officer and two suspects had been shot. It was later confirmed that there were no explosives inside the vehicle. After the attack, Phoenix police began searching the two assailants' apartment. Perpetrators Elton Simpson ( 1985 - May 3, 2015) and Nadir Hamid Soofi ( 1981 - May 3, 2015), roommates living in an apartment in Phoenix, Arizona, were the assailants in the attack. Simpson was convicted of making a false statement about terrorism in 2011, and followed hacker and pro-ISIL propagandist Junaid Hussain on Twitter. Simpson was an employee at a dentist's office, while Soofi was running a carpet cleaning business. A third man, Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem (born 1972), was responsible for housing Simpson and Soofi at his home, as well as supplying them with the firearms and ammunition used in the attack. According to an indictment, around June 2014, the three began conspiring to support ISIL and considered targeting a number of locations for terrorist attacks. Elton Simpson Simpson was born in Illinois and raised in suburban Westmont. He moved to Phoenix at a young age. He converted to Islam while attending Washington High School. His lawyer described him as \\"particularly devout\\" and \\"entrenched in Islam\\", but said he did not seem to be a threat to anyone. Simpson was a longtime worshiper at the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix, starting in approximately 2005, but according to the mosque's president, Usama Shami, he stopped showing up months prior to the attack. The mosque has been part of previous terrorism probes. He attended Yavapai College in Prescott, Arizona, playing basketball for the college there. Simpson was the subject of an FBI investigation starting in 2006, during which he stated his intent to travel to Somalia and join fellow jihadists. He had ties to Hassan Abujihaad, a former United States Navy sailor arrested in Phoenix and convicted of terrorism-related charges. Abujihaad had been an occasional attendant of the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix. In May 2009, Simpson told an FBI informant, \\"I'm telling you, man, we can make it to the battlefield. It's time to roll.\\" He was also recorded saying, \\"If you get shot, or you get killed, it's [heaven] straightaway... That's what we here for ... so why not take that route?\\" In 2010, one day before Simpson was scheduled to travel to Somalia, he was arrested by federal agents as the result of a four-year investigation. The Islamic Community Center of Phoenix posted cash bond of $100,000 to have him released from custody. Simpson was found guilty of making a false statement regarding international and domestic terrorism, and was sentenced to three years probation and a $600 fine in August 2011 after lying to a federal agent about his travel plans. His lenient sentence was the result of U.S. District Court Judge Mary H. Murguia not finding sufficient evidence to conclude that he planned to join a terrorist organization. He was put on the U.S. federal No Fly List. He had previously intended to travel with others to Syria to fight with ISIL, though his accomplices were arrested during simultaneous FBI raids in San Diego and Minneapolis. Authorities had already opened an investigation of Simpson at the time of the attack. He also interacted with Junaid Hussain, a British-born hacker and member of ISIL, and Mujahid Miski, an Al-Shabaab recruiter and propagandist of Muslim extremism from Minnesota, via Twitter through \\"secure communication\\". Hussain was also the founder of a pro-ISIL hacker group called \\"CyberCaliphate\\", which was responsible for a cyber-attack on the United States Central Command's Twitter account in January 2015. A week prior to the attack, Simpson mentioned the \\"First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit and Contest\\" event in a tweet sent to what is believed to be Hassan's Twitter account. Simpson then asked, \\"When will they ever learn?\\", and Hassan responded: \\"The brothers from the Charlie Hebdo attack did their part. It's time for brothers in the #US to do their part.\\" Investigators believe Hussain and Hassan encouraged Simpson to commit an attack on U.S. soil, but also that Simpson assembled the attack plan and targeted the art exhibit on his own accord. Simpson was identified as the same user who posted a tweet with the hashtag #texasattack: \\"May Allah accept us as mujahideen.\\" The profile photo on #texasattack was of the late American Salafi imam Anwar al-Awlaki, who had repeatedly called for violence against cartoonists who insulted the Muslim prophet Muhammad prior to being killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011 in Yemen.New York Times: \\"Gunman in Texas Shooting Was F.B.I. Suspect in Jihad Inquiry,\\" By MANNY FERNANDEZ, RICHARD P√âREZ-PE√ëA and FERNANDA SANTOS , May 4, 2015 Junaid Hussain was identified as the ISIL propagandist whom Simpson recommended his readers to follow in that same tweet. Nadir Soofi Soofi's father, Azam Soofi, is Pakistani, and his mother, Sharon Soofi, is American. According to his mother, he was born at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas and lived in Garland until age three. The family then moved to Plano, Texas, and then Alabama. His mother, who was raised Catholic, converted to Islam at the request of his father. Soofi was also raised as a Muslim by his father. He and his brother moved to Pakistan with their father and stepmother after their parents were divorced in the 1990s. During his time there, Soofi attended the International School of Islamabad, where he was said by friends to have been popular among his classmates. In 1998, after living in Pakistan for six years, Soofi moved back to the U.S. to live with his mother in Utah. The two later moved to Phoenix in the mid-2000s. According to his friends in Pakistan, he had difficulties adjusting to the American culture upon moving to the U.S. He took a pre-medical course at the University of Utah starting in the fall semester of 1998, but dropped out in the summer of 2003. At one point, he also owned Cleopatra Bistro Pizza, a pizza and hot wings eatery that served halal food, though the business struggled and eventually closed down five months prior to the attack. Soofi was arrested and charged for more than twenty minor offenses, most of them traffic violations. In June 2001, when he was twenty, he pleaded guilty to possession of alcohol by a minor. In March 2002, he pleaded guilty to alcohol-related reckless driving, followed by another guilty plea in June 2002 for driving on a suspended license. In 2003, he was charged for distributing a controlled substance and possessing drug paraphernalia, although the case was later dismissed. That same year in July, Soofi pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge. The case was also dismissed. He was survived by his parents and an eight-year-old son from a failed marriage. After the attack, his mother said her son was \\"brainwashed\\" by Simpson, claims that were echoed by his father and maternal grandmother, and that she did not blame police for killing her son. Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem Abdul Kareem was born and raised in Philadelphia as Decarus Lowell Thomas. In 2013, he changed his name to Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem and converted to Islam. He occasionally attended the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix since at least 2011 and cleaned carpets there. Kareem had a criminal record in Arizona, including two aggravated drunken driving convictions and an aggravated assault charge in 1997. In the latter incident, a woman told police that he pointed a gun in her direction; Abdul Kareem claimed he instead took the weapon away from his brother during an argument and wasn't pointing it at anyone. He had been arrested a total of eleven times between 1991 and 2004, and also served jail time twice. Following the attack, he lied to FBI investigators several times and said he was not asked by Simpson or Soofi to directly participate in the attack. However, according to a confidential informant, Kareem was indeed planning on participating with them and had been angry at the informant for not selling him suppressors and bulletproof vests. He allegedly attempted to fund the attack by feigning injuries inflicted after being struck by a car and then making an insurance claim based on the injuries. Previously, Abdul Kareem was investigated by the FBI in 2012 for having a terrorism training document on his computer and developing a plot to attack the Super Bowl XLIX game in Glendale, Arizona with pipe bombs. He had also reportedly accessed a list released by ISIL, which contained the names and addresses of U.S. service members. He was arrested on June 11 and charged with \\"conspiracy, making false statements and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a felony.\\" According to an indictment, Kareem practiced shooting with Simpson and Soofi between January and May in Phoenix. According to CNN, the firearms were all bought legally. His trial was initially set for August 4, but it was later rescheduled for October 6. On December 21, Abdul Kareem was also charged with conspiring to provide support to ISIL and attempting to attack the Super Bowl XLIX game. On March 17, 2016, Kareem was found guilty of conspiring with terrorists for helping the attack's perpetrators plan to carry it out. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in February 2017. ISIL claim of responsibility In addition to the gunman's tweet pledging allegiance to ISIL, the jihadist group claimed responsibility for the attack, stating on its Al Bayan radio station that \\"two soldiers of the Caliphate executed an attack on an art exhibit in Garland, Texas.... This exhibit was portraying negative pictures of the Prophet Mohammed.\\" It marked the first time ISIL took credit for an attack in the mainland U.S. ISIL promised to launch further attacks in the future. There was initially no evidence that ISIL had contact with the perpetrators, and law enforcement groups continued to investigate a possible link. Some counterterrorism experts expressed doubts on the legitimacy of those claims, noting that ISIL has in the past claimed responsibility for attacks they actually had no involvement in. One U.S. official said the attack was \\"certainly more than just inspiration\\" by ISIL. A law enforcement official said the attack did \\"not appear to be a clear-cut case of a lone wolf, nor a pure case of someone directed by others to act\\"; instead, \\"it appears to be something in between the two extremes\\". According to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, the shooting was inspired, but not directed, by ISIL.Department of Defense Press Briefing by Secretary Ash Carter and General Martin E. Dempsey in the Pentagon Briefing Room , United States Department of Defense (May 7, 2015). In August 2015, Centcom announced that it had killed Junaid Hussain in a drone strike in Syria, due to his influence in motivating lone wolf-style attacks. U.S. officials reportedly had a strong desire to assassinate Hussain, listing him as the third-highest ISIL target on the Pentagon's \\"kill list\\" behind Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Mohammed Emwazi. In December 2017, a Florida Jewish American internet troll, Joshua Ryne Goldberg, was convicted of planning the bombing of a 2015 9/11 memorial event in Kansas City. In his communications with an FBI informant, Goldberg claimed credit for inspiring the Garland attack. Goldberg's fake Twitter persona using the name \\"Australi Witness\\" had posted a map of the Curtis Culwell Center and urged any in the area to attack \\"with your weapons, bombs, or knives\\". News reports about Goldberg's online persona calling for the Garland attack first brought Goldberg to the attention of the FBI. The FBI also found that Elton Simpson retweeted a message from Goldberg's Twitter handle on the morning of the attack. Reactions and aftermath Following the attack, Texas Governor Greg Abbott released a statement, calling the attack \\"senseless\\" and promising there was an investigation underway. He also issued his gratitude to the Garland police officers for their swift action against the assailants. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said > [The attack] serves as a reminder that free and protected speech, no matter > how offensive to some, never justifies violence of any sort. This attack > also underscores the importance of close collaboration between federal, > state and local authorities in our Nation's homeland security efforts, as > well as public awareness and vigilance. Johnson urged American citizens to not \\"misdirect\\" their anger at Muslims. Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn said the contest was an expression of free speech. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also condemned the attack in a statement. Muslim organizations also reacted to the attack. The Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations issued a statement condemning the attack and saying, \\"Bigoted speech can never be an excuse for violence.\\" Dr. Nasim Rehmatullah, National Vice President of the U.S. chapter of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, also said in a statement: > Violence is never an acceptable response to hate speech, no matter how > inflammatory and uncivilized that speech is. While we do not yet know what > motivated these shooters, we urge calm and defer to local, state, and > federal authorities to peaceably and justly resolve this. Following the attack, ISIL supporters expressed their support online with postings on ISIL-affiliated websites.MAAMOUN YOUSSEF, U.S. News & World Report: \\"Islamic State Says Cartoon Attack Our Work Islamic State group claims responsibility for Texas attack targeting cartoon contest center\\" , usnews.com, May 5, 2015. Bosch Fawstin, the winner of the cartoon contest, has received numerous death threats. The Southern Poverty Law Center plans to discuss the incident in its 2016 report on hate in the United States. In the wake of the attack, the Garland Independent School District announced it would begin reviewing its policy for hosting events at the Curtis Culwell Center. On May 29, 2015, protesters staging a \\"Freedom of Speech\\" rally outside of the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix, the same mosque where Simpson and Soofi had attended, were met with counter-protests. Jon Ritzheimer, a former U.S. Marine, organized the protest to take place during Friday evening prayers as a \\"response to the recent attacks in Texas.\\" On June 2, 2015, Boston police killed a Roslindale man armed with a military-style knife after the man charged at the officers. The man had planned to assassinate Geller because of the contest, but became impatient and decided to target local police instead. In an interview with CNN, Geller denied that the event was intentionally provocative, criticized the media for not defending the First Amendment, and pointed out that other religions have been similarly offended but do not react violently. Geller later told CNN that the shooting would not stop her and the AFDI from organizing similar events in the future. She said regarding the attack, \\"Freedom of speech is under violent assault here.\\" She also said that the shooting showed how \\"needed our event really was.\\" The Chicago Tribune reported on August 1 that Soofi, despite his long rap sheet, purchased a 9mm gun in 2010 at Lone Wolf Trading Co., one of the private companies encouraged by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to sell weapons to persons who normally would not be legally allowed such purchases, an action that would later become the ATF gunwalking scandal. The Tribune wrote that Soofi's purchase was initially put on a seven-day hold but that \\"for reasons that remain unclear, the hold was lifted after 24 hours, and Soofi got the 9-millimeter.\\" The day after the attack, the U.S. Department of Justice sent an urgent firearms disposition request to Lone Wolf Trading Co. As of the date of the Tribunes report, the FBI has not released any details of the guns used by Simpson and Soofi.  Lawsuit against the FBI  The injured security guard, Bruce Joiner, filed a federal lawsuit in October 2017 against the FBI and DOJ. His suit argues the bureau \\"solicited, encouraged, directed and aided members of ISIS in planning and carrying out the May 3 attack,\\" and is asking for just over $8 million damages. Evidence submitted to court in previous cases confirm that an FBI undercover agent was in communication with the attackers and present at the Culwell Center during the attack. When he saw the attack underway he attempted to flee and was promptly stopped at gunpoint by Garland police. Court pleadings filed by the federal government in January 2018 as part of an attempt to get the suit dismissed confirmed that the undercover FBI agent \\"was dressed in Middle Eastern attire and police almost killed him, but he saved his life by claiming to be an FBI agent.\\" In a media interview, Joiner's attorney argued the attack was either \\"Just a complete botched operation where they [the FBI] don't want the attack to actually take place\\" or it was allowed to proceed in order to \\"bolster [the undercover agent's] street cred within ISIS\\". In March 2018, the undercover agent, appearing in disguise and under a pseudonym, testified in a criminal trial against Erick Jamal Hendricks. In that testimony the agent said he had no advance knowledge of the Garland attack and was surprised when the attackers opened fire. On December 21, 2018, US District Court Judge Karen Gren Scholer dismissed Joiner's lawsuit. In her opinion, Judge Scholer wrote: \\"The Court finds that the conduct alleged by Plaintiff fall[s] within the scope of the discretionary authority conferred on the FBI by the Undercover Guidelines and the [DIOG (Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide)].\\" Support and criticism of event Support for Geller and AFDI In an interview with Fox News Channel's The Kelly File, UCLA School of Law professor Eugene Volokh said > [T]his kind of discussion has value in debate about Islam and about the role > of Islam and about the reaction of some Muslims, fortunately only a small > portion of Muslims do these kinds of things. But beyond that it has value as > a reaffirmation of our free speech rights. It has value as an act of > defiance. It has value as people saying: look, we are not going to be shut > up. When you tell us that we cannot draw pictures of Mohammed, when you tell > us we cannot say these things or else you'll kill us, that just means that > we're going to do it again and again to show that you cannot threaten > Americans into submission. Also on The Kelly File, Alan Dershowitz said that \\"critics of Pamela Geller...should realize that while she may have intended to provoke a negative reaction from extreme Islamists, she shares something in common with civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.\\" Victor Davis Hanson wrote in an article in the National Review online magazine that \\"radical Islam has already cut a huge swathe out of American free speech through more than a decade of death threats.\\" He also wrote that the criticism directed towards Geller for supposedly striking up religious hatred was \\"scary\\" and compared Geller to the cartoonists who were killed during the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Bret Stephens, columnist for The Wall Street Journal, put Geller's speech in the same category as Bill Maher or the writers of Charlie Hebdo ‚Äî legitimate speech against Islamism ‚Äî and commented, \\"I say Islamist because there is a rich history of Muslim depictions of Muhammad.\\" He also added that \\"those [who] blame Geller for the provocation are blaming the victim just as those who say rape victims are asking for it.\\" Stephens went on to argue that a \\"society that rejects the notion of a heckler's veto cannot accept the idea of a murderer's veto...\\" Rich Lowry, writing in Politico, defended Geller's idea that the contest and exhibit's purpose was about freedom of speech: > Respectable opinion can't bear the idea that she has become a symbol of free > speech, which once upon a time was ‚Äî and still is, when convenient ‚Äî one of > the highest values of the media and the left. If Geller were a > groundbreaking pornographer like the loathsome Larry Flynt, someone would > already be planning a celebratory biopic of her life. If she were a gadfly > sticking it to a major Western religion rather than to Islam, she might be > considered more socially acceptable. Criticism of Geller and AFDI On the day after the shooting, Donald Trump, appearing on Fox & Friends, questioned Geller's motives. He said, \\"It looks like she's just taunting everybody. What is she doing? Drawing Mohammed and it looks like she's actually taunting people. (...) You know, I'm one that believes in free speech, probably more than she does. But what's the purpose of this?\\" In response to Trump's remarks, Bill O'Reilly said in his program The O'Reilly Factor, \\"Mr. Trump is correct. By setting up a contest and awarding $10,000 for a depiction of the Prophet Mohammed, the American Freedom Defense Initiative spurred a violent attack. (...) Insulting a religion with more than a billion followers does not advance the cause of defeating the fanatical jihadists. It hurts the cause.\\" Fox News' On the Record host Greta Van Susteren criticized Geller for putting police officers' lives in danger. She said, \\"It's one thing for someone to stand up for the First Amendment and put his own you-know-what on the line, but here, those insisting they were defending the First Amendment were knowingly putting officers' lives on the line ‚Äî the police.\\" Geller and Islamist Anjem Choudary appeared on Hannity on Fox News to debate the merits of AFDI's contest. In response to host Sean Hannity's question about whether Choudary supported an unverified ISIL fatwa and posted on an anonymous message board calling for Geller's death, he replied, \\"This isn't Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck they were drawing. This is the prophet. This woman wants to have people draw cartoons that insult the prophet knowing full well that carries the death penalty in Islam. So definitely, she's asking people to attack.\\" When Hannity asked whether he thought Geller should die, Choudary said, \\"She should be tried in a sharia court, be found guilty, and, of course, she would face capital punishment.\\" After Hannity reminded Choudary that Geller is not a Muslim, he continued, \\"You can't go down that road, insulting Muslims, and think the Muslims aren't going to retaliate back. I would attack someone if they insult my mother, let alone the prophet who I love 100 times more.\\" Garland Mayor Douglas Athas said he wished Geller had not chosen his town for her event and explained, \\"Her actions put my police officers, my citizens and others at risk. Her program invited an incendiary reaction. She picked my community, which does not support in any shape, passion or form, her ideology. (...) But at the end of the day, we did our jobs, we protected her freedoms and her life\\". In an interview with The New York Times, the editor of Charlie Hebdo, G√©rard Biard, rejected \\"attempts by right-wing activists to exploit that attack for their own agendas\\". He also added, \\"We have nothing to do with Pamela Geller's work. When Islam or the Prophet Muhammad jump out of the news, we comment on it, we mock it, maybe. But we are not obsessed about it.\\" See also * 2015 Copenhagen shootings * Charlie Hebdo shooting * Everybody Draw Mohammed Day * Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy * List of Islamist terrorist attacks Notes References 2015 in Texas 2015 crimes in the United States Attacks in the United States in 2015 Crimes in Texas Deaths by firearm in Texas Defensive gun use Cultural depictions of Muhammad Failed terrorist attempts in the United States Freedom of speech in the United States Garland, Texas ISIL terrorist incidents in the United States Islamic terrorism in Texas Islamic terrorism in the United States May 2015 crimes May 2015 events in the United States +Curtis Terrorist incidents in Texas Terrorist incidents in the United States in 2015 Garland Independent School District ","title":"Curtis Culwell Center attack"},{"id":"46602592","text":"\\"Midday Run\\" is the eighth episode of the fifth season of the animated comedy series Bob's Burgers and the overall 75th episode, and is written by Scott Jacobson and directed by Ian Hamilton. It aired on Fox in the United States on January 4, 2015. Plot Tina is up for a promotion in her hall monitoring duties to its highest rank. Regular Size Rudy, a low ranking hall monitor, admires Tina for her stringent adherence to the rules, even writing up Gene and Louise for horsing around. Mr. Frond tasks Tina with delivering Zeke to the principal's office for his immediate suspension after breaking into the Coach Blevin's office. Rudy wants to join, but Tina tells him she will do it alone and tells him to finish his duties. Zeke begs her to let him go and tells her he did it for his grandmother, but Tina refuses to listen. He then asks if he can at least go to the bathroom and she allows him to. After some time passes, she realizes that Zeke has escaped out the bathroom window. She searches for him, unaware that Rudy has seen everything. Realizing that finding Zeke will be almost impossible when lunchtime rolls around, Tina turns to Gene and Louise for help in finding Zeke, offering them \\"permanent hall passes\\" in exchange for help in finding him. After getting help from Gene and Louise, Tina questions Jimmy Jr. about Zeke's whereabouts, who says that although he doesn't know for sure, he knows a hiding place he goes to sometimes. Tina manages to find Zeke, escorting him to the principal's office again. On the way, Rudy confronts her, claiming that she was his hero, but has broken the rules and \\"gone dirty\\". He demands to take Zeke to the principal's office himself to expose her. As students flood the halls, Tina uses the distraction to lead Zeke through another path to the principal's office, hoping to get there before Rudy. On the way, Zeke pleads with Tina once again to let him go. He reveals that his grandmother is fond of mascots and scheduled for surgery and that he wanted to take the mascot from Coach Blevin's office and wear it for her at the retirement home to cheer her up. Tina is sympathetic, but says he should have asked permission. Zeke says that he did seek permission from Coach Blevins, who still said no. After barely evading Ms. LaBonz, Tina makes her way back inside the school through another entrance. Upon entering school however, they are intercepted by Rudy, who alerts Mr. Frond, who cancels Tina's promotion and takes Zeke to the principal's office. Disgraced, Tina goes to the administrative office and overhears a phone conversation from Zeke's grandmother asking if he will visit her at the retirement home. Realizing that Zeke was telling the truth, she steals the mascot suit. She apologizes to Gene and Louise, and they help her bust Zeke out of the principal's office. She gives him the mascot suit and tells him to go. Mr. Frond confronts her and she protests that the law is too stringent and that people and their situations are complicated, and that ultimately, she believes Zeke. Frond insists that Zeke is a liar and that the story and phone call are a ruse Zeke concocted. He wagers her that if Zeke's story turns out to be fake, Tina will be punished with one month's detention and stripped of her hall monitor privileges. Tina states that if she wins, she only wants that Zeke's suspension be overturned, though Frond also sarcastically adds that he will also buy everyone ice cream. They, including Rudy, arrive at the retirement home and find Zeke's grandmother, but no sign of Zeke. Rudy sympathizes with Tina while Mr. Frond gloats and taunts her until Zeke comes out dancing in the mascot suit. Frond loses the wager and begrudgingly leaves to buy everyone ice cream. Meanwhile, in a subplot, Bob is vexed when Linda begins hanging customers' napkin doodles as restaurant art, but his own drawings are deemed too terrible by Linda to hang on the wall, with Teddy siding with her. With no other options, he swallows his pride and reluctantly asks the elderly Edith Cranwinkle and her husband Harold, the antagonistic owners of the local art store Reflections, for drawing lessons. Edith begrudgingly accepts him as a student and gives him a crash course that involves him buying art supplies and finally drawing her naked form. Bob triumphantly returns with his drawing of nude Edith, and Linda and the kids celebrate his newfound skill by hanging the picture up on the wall. Cultural references The episode's plot, based around a person of authority escorting a criminal to a final location, references several similarly plotted films. The title is an homage to the 1988 action-comedy film Midnight Run, while the plot has various references to the 1993 film The Fugitive. The early structure of the episode with Tina and Rudy also references the 2001 film Training Day. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, criticizing the main plot's lack of a clearly defined central conflict. However, Wilkins found the episode enjoyable, stating, \\"'Midday Run' is such a rollicking good time that it almost doesn‚Äôt matter how much of a mess it is. Building a story around Tina as a hall monitor gone rogue is all sorts of genius, and there are plenty of terrific laughs to be had from the lengths Tina goes to in her quest to find Zeke, but where the story falters somewhat is in figuring out just what the actual conflict is here.\\" By contrast, Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10, stating, \\"The return of Bob‚Äôs Burgers after a far-too-long hiatus was welcome this week, but it felt even more so with a half-hour that managed to get funnier and funnier as it went along, and was capped off by a great closing moment with the family. And any episode that focuses on the travails of Tina tends to be a near-classic.\\" The episode received a 2.0 rating and was watched by a total of 3.95 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Fox that night, behind Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Family Guy, and The Simpsons, but also the most watched episode of the season thus far.

Education Annand was educated at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art in the city of Dundee. He then taught for fourteen years. Art In 1988, Annand decided to devote himself full-time to his sculpture work. His work can be seen in many cities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Many of Annands works are placed in public spaces and relate to local history or literature. In 2009, he unveiled the sculpture The Turf Man which is based on the poem Digging out the bundle Death of a Naturalist (1966). He was commissioned by the County Council in conjunction with the NRA in Ireland to create a sculpture to celebrate Patrick Kavanagh's poem Dancing with Kitty Stobling. The sculpture is visible on the Carrickmacross bypass section of the N2. In 2010, he won a commission to create a ¬£100,000 tribute to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, one of Suffolk's most influential figures. The completed work was placed close to Curson House on St Peter's Street in Ipswich. The artist lives and works in Kilmany in the Scottish county of Fife.

PC Music Volume 1 includes one new track‚Äî\\"USA\\" by GFOTY, which had previously appeared on her Secret Mix. The label's musical acts function more as avatars than as themselves. The songs carry themes of escaping physical life, with an artificial quality that intensifies feelings of longing. PC Music often uses the motif of eternity, and several of the songs use together/forever rhymes. The album's digital take on dance-pop music favours retrofuturistic Eurodance and high-pitched, cutesy female vocals. Its often minimalist production produces frenetic, distorted mixes. Critical reception PC Music Volume 1 garnered polarising yet mostly positive reviews from critics. As of June 2015, the album holds an aggregate 73 out of 100 based on eight reviews. Consequence of Sound wrote that the album \\"leaves space for agnosticism about whether it's all a joke or a deathly serious artistic maneuver.\\" Spin magazine regretted the omission of some of the label's more satirical work, but it continued that \\"at almost 30 minutes exactly, PC Music Volume 1 quits while it's ahead.\\" Pitchfork described the album as a \\"rapturous, nightmarish cartoon corpus\\" that showcases \\"a meaningful spectrum of approaches within the PC Music ethos\\".

This species is cosmopolitan, inhabiting temporary freshwater ponds over much of the world, and the most widespread of the tadpole shrimps. Like other notostracans, L. apus has a broad carapace, long segmented abdomen, and large numbers of paddle-like legs. It reproduces by a mixture of sexual reproduction and self-fertilisation of females. Description Lepidurus apus grows to in length. Its long abdomen is divided into about 30 segment-like rings, with two long caudal rami or \\"tails\\" attached behind the last ring. Between the tails is a projection which distinguishes Lepidurus from Triops, the other notostracan genus. Its carapace is flat with an average length of , and is attached only at the front, covering up to two thirds of the abdomen. The carapace is a mottled dark yellow/brown colour transitioning to a lighter edge, and bears a single pair of compound eyes. At the front of the abdomen are one or more (up to three) pairs of feelers. Under the body are 41‚Äì46 (average 44) pairs of paddle-like limbs used for swimming. Males are readily identifiable by the lack of ovisacs, and also have subtle differences in the carapace. Females and hermaphrodites look virtually identical, but hermaphrodites have testicular lobes amongst their ovarian lobes, which allows them to reproduce in isolation. L. apus is often referred to as a ‚Äòliving fossil‚Äô, virtually unchanged for over 300 million years. However, a recent study suggests that resemblance to fossil notostracans is probably a result of the \\"highly conserved general morphology in this group and of homoplasy\\". Recent species of Lepidurus are morphologically nearly identical to fossil records but may \\"represent very different evolutionary lineages\\".  Distribution and habitat   Global range  Lepidurus apus is perhaps the most cosmopolitan of all the Notostraca, occurring widely around the world including, but not limited to, New Zealand, Australia, Iran, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Morocco, and Austria. Lepidurus apus is split into several geographic subspecies, such as L. apus viridis, present in parts of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand.  Habitat preferences  Lepidurus apus is found predominantly in temporary freshwater ponds, 10‚Äì100 cm deep, filled during autumn and winter, and drying out over spring and summer. It is less common in permanent water bodies such as swamps and ditches. Lepidurus apus viridis, for example, is found throughout New Zealand in small ponds and ditches. Its life- cycle allows it to become dormant if the pond freezes over, is covered with snow, or dries out; it can persist in the dry sediment margin as a cyst form, which can survive harsh conditions for many years until the pond reappears. L. apus prefers a PH between 6 and 7.8, and can tolerate relatively high concentrations of chemicals, such as levels of total nitrate of 1 mg/L and phosphate of 0.1 mg/L, a level which would be detrimental to other aquatic species. Wetlands and temporary ponds worldwide are increasingly being converted to grasslands for agriculture, so the total land area available for L. apus is gradually diminishing. Some subspecies may become threatened in future, or may already be under threat, although our knowledge is limited. L. apus is well-adapted to variations of climate and location, disperses easily, and has highly resilient eggs, so appears to be less sensitive to human pressures across its wide geographical range. Life cycle Lepidurus apus has an unusual life-cycle: it is able to produce microscopic cysts that can lie dormant for years at a time through extreme conditions, letting it survive in areas with vastly different climates such as Morocco and Denmark. These \\"resting eggs\\" are so drought resistant there is a record of hatching after being kept dry for 28 years. The species is hermaphroditic; no males are found in the New Zealand subspecies viridius, but in Italy there are males that are non-functional. Different subspecies of Lepidurus apus have different methods of fertilisation, some by a male, some by hermaphroditic individuals. Cysts average 0.447 mm in diameter, and have been found at concentrations of 250 per 100 cm2. They are laid on gravel in the middle of ditches or ponds, to avoid (it is speculated) large animals such as sheep transporting the cysts onto land. The cysts can survive drought and sub-zero temperatures, and can even synthesise haemoglobin if there is a lack of oxygen. As the pond dries out in the summer, the cysts will lie dormant until immersed in water. Light is an important factor in hatching: experiments showed no cysts hatched in darkness, some hatched after 10 mins of bright light, and all hatched in continuous light. They hatched between 10 ¬∞C and 24 ¬∞C, though the optimum was 16 ¬∞C and 20 ¬∞C, and even then hatch rates did not exceed 60%. Hatching often happens after winter rainfall forms temporary ponds. Larvae feed and rapidly grow to maturity, in as little as 4 weeks in optimum conditions in the warmer summer and spring months. Lepidurus apus has been found globally in remote areas with no waterways to transport individuals. In dry conditions, the dust-like resting eggs are easily distributed by wind. Lepidurus apus eggs are also though to be distributed by water, people, wildlife, and migratory birds. Diet Lepidurus apus is omnivorous, feeding on both plant matter, mostly floating detritus, and small aquatic invertebrates such as Branchinecta and Daphnia. It swims along the bottom of ponds, stirring up the substrate as it forages. The genus Lepidurus also feeds upon algae, myxozoa, bacteria and fungi. Predators and parasites Predators of Lepidurus include small wading birds such as sandpipers or stint, larger waterfowl like ducks and swans, and, in some ponds, fishes. Migrating birds feed from temporary pools, as well as itinerant birds already found in the area. The rapid abundance of Lepidurus apus and other small invertebrates in pools often results in an increase in bird numbers in the area. Nosema lepiduri is a microsporidian parasite found in water bodies less than 15 cm deep that internally parasitises Lepidurus with spores, in some cases killing the host. Infected Lepidurus have a milky white colouration on the legs and carapace due to internal infection.  Conservation status  The subspecies Lepidurus apus viridis has been classified by the New Zealand Department of Conservation as Nationally Endangered under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

Background A silhouette of U.S. Army (Union) General George H. Thomas' life-size statue by sculptor Rodolfo Ayoroa, located at Civil War Park, Lebanon, KentuckyAyoroa (also known as Rudy Ayoroa, Rodolfo E. Ayoroa, Rudy Aroyoa, Rudy Ayora) was born in La Paz, Bolivia on September 16, 1927. His parents were Esther Soria-Galvarro of LaPaz, Bolivia, and the late Gen. Robert Ayoroa. He was educated at the University of Buenos Aires in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1964, he moved to Washington, DC and was a visiting professor at American University. In the mid 1980s he moved to Danville, Kentucky with his wife, Jane, who was born there. Art Ayoroa was at the forefront of the kinetic art movement in the mid-1950s. His paintings are filled with geometric elements and contrasts of warm and blue colors. His sculptures are made with Plexiglass bent into geometric shapes to look like perpetual motion. Ayoroa's art hangs in the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; the Library of Congress; National Museum of American Art; Smithsonian Institution; Museum of Modern Art of Latin America at the Organization of American States, Museum of Modern Art in Bogota, Colombia and National Museum of Fine Arts in La Paz, Bolivia. During his time in Danville, he developed an interest in painting Civil War battle scenes and did many pictures of the Battle of Perryville. He was commissioned by Lebanon to sculpt Confederate Major General John Hunt Morgan in 1999. However, the statue of the Confederate general, who raided and destroyed parts of the town, Kentucky Historical Society: Battle of Lebanon was never publicly displayed there. In 2015 the township put the statue out to bid.Lebanon Enterprise: City puts Morgan statue up for bid In 1999 Ayoroa created the life-size sculpture of U.S. Army Major General George Henry Thomas, which was unveiled in Civil War Park, Lebanon, Kentucky, where it stands today.Announcement of Lebanon sculpture Solo exhibitions *2003 Greater Loveland Historical Museum, Loveland, Ohio *2001 Museum of the Civil War, Bardstown, KY *1997 Chaing Kai-Shek Memorial Center, Tai Pei, Taiwan *1996 Teledyne Corporation, Lebanon, Kentucky *1994 Taipinquiri Gallery and Art Center, La Paz, Bolivia *1994 EMUSA Gallery, La Paz, Bolivia *1993 EMUSA Gallery, La Paz, Bolivia *1991 Inter-American Development Bank, Washington, D.C. *1990 EMUSA Gallery, La Paz, Bolivia *1989 Headley-Whitney Museum, Lexington, Kentucky *1988 Inter-American Development Bank, Washington, D.C. *1982‚Äì83 Multiple Galleries in La Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, Bolivia *1981 San Diego Gallery, Bogota, Colombia *1980 Norton Center for the Arts, Centre College, Danville, Kentucky *EMUSA Gallery, La Paz, Bolivia *Inter-American Development Bank, Washington, D.C. *1979 Gallery Uno, Dos, Tres, San Salvador, El Salvador *El Camino Real Gallery, Boca Raton, Florida *Fayetteville Museum of Art, North Carolina *1977 Genesis Gallery, New York City *Museum of Contemporary Art, Bogota, Colombia *EMUSA Gallery, La Paz, Bolivia *Lorenz Gallery, Bethesda, Maryland *National Museum of Fine Art, La Paz, Bolivia *1976 Washington World Gallery, Washington, D.C. *Huber Gallery, Washington, D.C. *National Library, San Jose, Costa Rica *1974 Franz Bader Gallery, Washington, D.C. *National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C. *1969 Group Gallery, Jacksonville, Florida *1968 Casa del Arte, San Juan, Puerto Rico *Pan American Union (OAS), Washington, D.C. *1967 Asociaci√≥n Estimulo de Bellas Artes, Buenos Aires, Argentina (Ayoroa, B√≥to, Vard√°nega) *1956 San Andres University, La Paz, Bolivia *Bolivian-German Cultural Institute, La Paz, Bolivia Academic appointments *1981‚Äì82 Visiting Professor of Art, San Francisco Xavier University, Sucre, Bolivia *1974‚Äì75 Visiting Professor of Art, American University, Washington, D.C.

In addition to its web-based PR software suites, the company owns the online publicity services, PRWeb and Help a Reporter Out (HARO). Vocus was founded in 1992 by Rick Rudman and Bob Lentz and was a publicly held company until June 2014 when it was taken private by Chicago-based private equity company GTCR. The company operates additional offices in the United States, Europe and Asia. Since late 2014, the company merged with Cision AB to form Cision Inc. as the succeeding company. History and acquisitions Early history Vocus Inc. was founded in 1992 by chief executive officer Rick Rudman and his business partner, Bob Lentz. The two had previously been investors at First Data Software Publishing, which they co-founded in 1991 to develop software supporting political organizations' external communications. Rudman and Lentz bought out the firm's other two partners and quit their jobs to relaunch the company as Vocus. In its early years, Vocus developed software to help political action committees and grassroots organizations track and organize donors and contacts. In 1997, the company expanded its services to offer public relations software, including a product developed specifically for clients outside of the political sector, to help them manage external communications. In 1999, Vocus discontinued the use of packaged software products, choosing instead to offer its software over the Internet. 2000s During the 2000s, the company continued to expand its public relations services. In October 2002, Vocus announced the release of its application programming interface (API), built using Microsoft XML, which allowed companies to integrate Vocus software with other business productivity applications. In 2005, Vocus held its initial public offering, selling 5 million shares of stock and raising a total of $45 million. The same year, Vocus was ranked number 50 on Washington Business Journal's list of the fastest growing companies, after its revenue grew 32.5% from 2004 to 2005. Vocus purchased PRWeb, the press release service, in August 2006 for $28 million in cash and stock. The acquisition allowed Vocus customers to access PRWeb's online press release distribution services. The following year, in 2007, Vocus established a partnership with the Associated Press, allowing Vocus users to distribute press releases within the AP network. 2010 onwards The company continued to expand through acquisitions from 2010 onward. In 2010, Vocus acquired two software companies offering public relations services similar to Vocus': the French company Datapresse and the Chinese company BDL Media. The same year, the company also acquired the online service Help a Reporter Out (HARO). In February 2011, Vocus announced it had acquired two social media marketing companies, Engine 140, which develops marketing software for use with Twitter, and North Social, developer of Facebook customization software. In 2012, Vocus acquired the email marketing software company, iContact, for $169 million in cash and stock. Vocus holds an annual users conference. In 2013, the conference was opened up to all industry communication professionals. The \\"Demand Success\\" 2013 conference took place June 20 and 21, 2013 and featured keynote speakers Arianna Huffington and Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men). The \\"Demand Success\\" 2014 conference took place June 5 and 6, 2013 and featured keynote speakers Randi Zuckerberg, Adrian Grenier and Judy Smith. In October 14, 2014, Cision and Vocus announced a friendly merger of the two public relations companies. Cision based in Sweden will relocate its headquarters to Chicago and so will Vocus from Maryland. The company will be based out of Chicago and the combined entity will be known as Cision. Corporate overview Vocus was led by chief executive officer, Peter Granat. In 2013, the company reported revenue of $186.9 million, up from $170.0 million in 2012 and $114.8 million in 2011. The company headquarters are in Beltsville, Maryland. In the United States, Vocus also operates offices in College Park, Maryland; Herndon and Reston, Virginia and Ferndale, Washington.

He was honoured by the Government of India in 1964, with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award for his services to the nation. Biography Early years Paramananda Acharya was born in 1893 at Baidyapur village in the Indian state of Odisha and completed his early schooling at Amarda ME School and Baripada High School to graduate in Botany from Kolkata University in 1923 with honours. Though joined for his master's degree course, he abandoned studies on advice from Maharaja Purna Chandra Bhanjadeo, the erstwhile Maharaja of Mayurbhanj state and became a part of the team of renowned archaeologist, Rai Bahadur Ramaprasad Chanda in 1924. He had no formal training in archaeology, but Acaharya was invited to join the department of archaeology when Mayurbhanj state established the department in 1925 and he started his government service as an archaeological scholar. Career Ananta Vasudeva Temple His initial posting was at Khiching with the responsibility of preserving the temples and historical sites in the area. In 1925, he underwent advanced training at Paharpur excavation site (presently in Bangladesh). During the next few years, he visited the neighbouring cities and states but returned to Khiching and started collecting sculptures, artifacts and antiquities from the medieval period. These finds were stored in Khiching temple premises which later became the Khiching Museum in 1928 and Acharya was appointed as the Senior Archaeologist of the museum. In 1930, when the Maharaja ordered the excavation of the Old Palace site in Hariharpur, Acharya was given the responsibility. During this project, he arranged for the dismantling of the dilapidated temples of Chandra Sekhar and Kutei-Tundi situated at the Palace site and restored them. He also restored the temple of Hara during this period. Acharya participated in the first International Congress of the Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, in 1934 and the trip to London helped him to gather copies of records related to Mayurbhanj and Ananta Vasudeva Temple of Bhubaneswar. A plaster copy of one of the inscriptions he brought is on display at the Odisha State Museum. In 1939, an expedition led by Acharya and E. C. Worman (Jr.) of Harvard University discovered Kuliana site near Mayurbhanj. Three years later, he was deputed to Khandapada, Banesvaranasi, Champesvar, Bhattarika, Simhanath and Ramchandi which resulted in the discovery of a temple at Ramchandi with a unique style of architecture. It was during this period, he undertook the reconstruction of Khichingesvari temple which was completed in 1942. Later, he discovered the Anantasayi Vishnu image at Saranga and Bhimkund. He also conducted surveys of archaeological relics at Vaitarani, Brahmani, and Mahanadi valleys. Post Independence period After the princely state of Mayurbhanj was assimilated into the state of Odisha under the Indian Union in 1949, Acharya became the Superintendent of Archaeology, Museum and Research of the state government with office at the Ravenshaw College premises in Cuttack. He was also given additional responsibility to attend to duties related to the state education department. During his tenure as its head, the department is reported to have developed into the present day Odisha State Museum. His efforts were reported in bringing many renowned archaeologists such as Kedar Nath Mahapatra and Satya Narayan Rajguru, Krushna Chandra Panigrahi and Susil Chandra De together under the banner of the museum. Later years and legacy Odisha State Museum After his retirement from government service in 1950, Acharya was given the special responsibility as the Superintendent of the Odisha State Museum, and he served in that position till 1954. After a gap of one year, he took up work again in 1955, this time as the Superintendent of Archaeology, holding the post till 1962. Two years later, the Government of India honoured him with the civilian award of Padma Shri in 1964. Acharya is the author of several articles and two books, Essays in History, Culture, Archaeology of Odisha, and Studies in Orissan History, Archaeology and Archives His writings are prescribed as reference books for graduate and post graduate studies at Ravenshaw University in Odisha. A commemorative volume, Life and culture in Orissa was published in 1984, compiling several of Acharya's writings. Paramanand Acharya died on 11 April 1971, at his residence in Baripada, at the age of 78.

The two-level, 44,000-square-foot facility was constructed during the final phase of the renovation of the adjacent Frank Erwin Center, the multipurpose, on-campus arena that serves as the home court for the Longhorn basketball teams. The Texas men's and women's teams have separate 9,000-square-foot practice court areas, each consisting of one full-court and one half-court practice area with seven basket stations. The practice facility also includes a locker room with a players' lounge, an instructional film theater, a 4,100-square-foot strength and conditioning area, an athletic training and hydrotherapy area, an academic resource and activity center, and a coaches' lounge and locker room. The master plan released in 2013 for the University's new Dell Medical School indicated that the Cooley Pavilion and Erwin Center would be demolished in a later phase of construction within six to fifteen years. Ultimately, UT announced plans to build a new basketball arena, to be named Moody Center, that is scheduled to open in 2022.

She is married to Sir Paul Ruddock. Early life Ruddock was born in Baltimore, Maryland. She attended Northwestern High School in Baltimore before receiving a degree in Politics from Bowdoin College. After early jobs in advertising and publishing for Young & Rubicam, Inc. Magazine and The Atlantic, she relocated to London in 1983 and co-ran The Government Research Corporation before joining Alex. Brown & Sons in 1985, becoming managing director in 1994. There she oversaw the mergers of the firm's European equity business with both Bankers Trust and Deutsche Bank. Philanthropy  After leaving Alex Brown in 1999 Ruddock became involved in the theatre, joining the main boards of The Donmar Warehouse and the educational theatre charity, The Mousetrap Theatre Projects, which seeks to bring theatre to disadvantaged young people. She was a trustee of the main board of Governors at Bowdoin College for ten years. Together with her husband, they are donors at The Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, the Courtauld Institute of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Bowdoin College Museum of Art and are ambassadors of AfriKids, a child rights organisation that works alongside indigenous communities in Ghana to improve the quality of life for rejected and vulnerable children. She and her husband are patrons of The Donmar Warehouse, The Mousetrap Theatre Projects, The Hampstead Theatre, The National Theatre and Almeida Theatre. In May 2015 Ruddock was made a \\"Chevalier dans Ordre des Arts et Lettres\\" for services to French art, awarded by the French Government's Minister of Culture. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours, in recognition of her philanthropic work with older people. The Second Half of Your Life Ruddock is the author of The Second Half of Your Life (Vermilion, 2011), a book about successful ageing using menopause as the hormonal springboard to get to the best years of a woman's life. It offers practical hands-on advice for post-menopausal women, covering many of the issues women face as they grow older: from finance, dating, divorce, exercise, going back to work, the libido, marriage, andropause and to how to look your best. The book also emphasises what she believes is the foundation for healthy ageing, her \\"Five A Day\\"; purpose, passion, exercise, nutrition and staying connected to family friends and community. The book is now in its 9th printing and was released in mass market paperback in March 2015. \\"I'm trying to rebrand the entire process of getting old,\\" she has told the press, arguing that the menopause should be welcomed rather than feared by women. All author proceeds go to fund the work of The Second Half Foundation. The Second Half Foundation and Second Half Centre Ruddock is chairman and founder of The Second Half of Life Foundation (Reg 1141988), a charity which seeks to address loneliness and isolation among the over 50s for any person from any background over the age of 50: from the underprivileged to ethnic minorities to those who are just isolated through the creation of community centre. The first Second Half Centre opened in October 2012 at the NHS St. Charles's Hospital, North Kensington. The centre brings to life the \\"Five a Day\\" for successful ageing as cited in her book, offering older adults the opportunity to socialise, learn new skills, and exercise for a small fee. The project's supporters include Jeremy Hunt MP, Maureen Lipman and Ruby Wax. The Mayor of Kensington and Chelsea named the Second Half Foundation as her charity of the year in 2011‚Äì2012. The Second Half Foundation is creating a self-sustaining template to reflect 21st century solutions to the problems facing our ageing population in the 21st century. In addition to The Second Half Centre now run by Open Age, which has over 4000 members and 80 hours of activities weekly, Ruddock has expanded in London, partnering with the Diocese of London creating four Second Half Clubs in churches on days not of worship: St Stephen, St Andrews, St Paul's and St Mary The Boltons.

About 682 Bosniak men and boys, from the multiple villages around Zvornik, were separated from their families by Serb forces, and slaughtered within a week at Bijeli Potok and their bodies hidden in mass graves throughout the Drina Valley. As of May 2020, the remains of about 245 of the victims have yet to be found. Background and overview The Bosnian War started in spring of 1992. On 8 April 1992, Serbs (of the Army of Republika Srpska and Serbian volunteer soldiers) occupied the city of Zvornik and began occupying and ethnically cleansing surrounding villages of the Bosnian Muslim inhabitants. Bosnian Muslims were ethnically cleansed from all villages between April and May 1992, including Hajdareviƒái, Dardagani, ƒêuliƒái, Bijeli Potok, Kuƒçiƒá Kula, Klisa, ≈†etiƒái, Lupiƒái, Petkovci, Tr≈°iƒá, Radava, Liplje, ƒåeli≈°mani, Mahmutoviƒái, Sjenokos, and D≈æine. Some were chased out to the village Klisa. On 31 May 1992 Nurija Ja≈°areviƒá, president of the local community Klisa, and Alija ƒêuliƒá, president of the local community ƒêuliƒái, made a deal with the Serb invaders that all of the Bosnian Muslims would relocate to the safe area of Sapna via trucks, cars and tractors in the morning. This never occurred and the following day a massacre occurred in which most Bosnian Muslim men and boys, aged 15 to 80, were killed by the Serbs. The largest number of victims in this massacre from a single village was from ƒêuliƒái, with between 176 and 188 victims killed in the 1 June 1992 massacre. Mass graves and remains In 2003, the Crni Vrh mass grave was uncovered, containing the remains of 629 Bosnian Muslim victims of massacres around Zvornik and Srebrenica during the war. Some of the victims were killed in the Bijeli Potok massacre, and multiple other massacres including the Srebrenica Genocide. Related events Retribution for this massacre is believed to be the motive behind the 2015 Zvornik police station shooting. The shooter, Nerdin Ibriƒá, was one year old at the time of the massacre, when his father Sejfo was taken by Serbs from the Army of Republika Srpska and became one of the 668 Bosnian Muslim victims of the massacre.

Description Megadromus antarcticus size can range in length from 22mm to 34mm.Britton, E. B. (1940). The Carabidae (Coleoptera) of New Zealand. Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand, 69, 484. Megadromus antarcticus is a member of the Adephaga suborder which is morphologically defined by the presence of liquid feeding mouth parts as larvae and once matured, has six abdominal ventrites and pygidial glands.Lovei, G. L., & Sunderland, K. D. (1996). Ecology and behavior of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). Annu Rev Entomol, 41(1), 231-256. Adephaga such as Megadromus antarcticus are also characterized by being well- proportioned with prominent mandibles, long slender legs and straight elyra. Adephaga are cursorial beetles which means they are adapted specifically for running. Megadromus antarcticus is considered black - greenish with the brims of the pronotum and elytra a metallic green colour. This colouring gives Megadromus antarcticus a fascinating appearance which has also been referred to as iridescent green.Butcher, M. R., & Emberson, R. M. (1981). Aspects of the biology of carabid beetles of Ahuriri Bush Scenic Reserve, Banks Peninsula. Mauri ora, 9, 59-70.  Distribution   Natural global range  Megadromus antarcticus is an endemic New Zealand species.Fountain, E. D. (2013). Time travelling weevils: Unravelling the evolutionary past of Hadramphus using historical and modern DNA. Unpublished doctoral thesis, Lincoln University, Lincoln, New Zealand.  New Zealand range  Megadromus antarcticus is common throughout much of the Canterbury region. Their range extents from a northern limit in the Waikari area, to the coast in the east, comprising Banks Peninsula, as far south as the Cave area in South Canterbury, and to the lower reach of the Southern Alps in western Canterbury. Because Megadromus antarcticus is flightless it has limited Biological dispersal ability. Additionally the braided rivers of the Canterbury plains present a significant obstacle to Megadromus antarcticus.  Habitat preferences  Megadromus antarcticus is a generalist predator so can be successful in variety of different habitats. A very common habitat for Megadromus antarcticus to be sighted is in home gardens.Johns, P. (1986). Arthropods of Banks Peninsula reserves: Zoology Department, University of Canterbury. Other common Megadromus antarcticus habitats include urban areas, agricultural areas, native forests and exotic forests. They are also frequently been found amongst grassland log sites.Anderson, S. J. (2000). Distribution, habitat associations, and activity patterns of two endemic Banks Peninsula carabid beetles, Mecodema howitti and Megadromus guerinii. Unpublished doctoral thesis, Lincoln University, Lincoln, New Zealand. Life cycle/phenology The incubation period of Megadromus antarcticus eggs varies dependent on the time of year. This incubation period can range from just over four weeks for eggs laid in late August to three weeks for eggs laid in February. Megadromus antarcticus females do not leave their egg chamber to feed during this period making them particularly attentive parents. Diet and foraging Megadromus antarcticus is considered a generalist predator. This allows Megadromus antarcticus to feed on variety of different insects and larvae that live in habitats similar to its own. Prey of Megadromus antarcticus includes some species of slugs which are considered pests to the New Zealand agriculture industry.Fountain, E. D. (2013). Chapman, R. B., Simeonidis, A. S., & Smith, J. T. (1997). Evaluation of metallic green ground beetle as a predator of slugs. Proceedings of the Fiftieth New Zealand Plant Protection Conference, 51-55. In a study conducted in controlled conditions, Megadromus antarcticus preyed on both Deroceras panormitanum and Deroceras reticulatum (grey field slug) with an average consumption rate of 0.55 slugs per day. Predators, parasites, and diseases Coleoptera which includes Megadromus antarcticus are most common insect Ninox novaeseelandiae (morepork) prey upon.Haw, J. M., and M. N. Clout. (1999). Diet of morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae) throughout New Zealand by analysis of stomach contents. Notornis, 46, 333-345. Circus approximans (Australasian harrier) are a bird of prey very common to the Canterbury region and 8% of their diet also consists of Insecta (insects) which includes Megadromus antarcticus.Baker-Gabb, D.

After post-doctoral experience at St. Thomas‚Äôs Hospital in London (1974‚Äì75) and McMaster University in Canada (1975‚Äì76), he was appointed foundation professor of community medicine at the University of Newcastle (New South Wales) in 1976 and remained there until the end of 1985. Leeder played a role in the development of innovative medical curriculum, and was foundation director of the Asian and Pacific Centre for Clinical Epidemiology. The Rockefeller Foundation awarded a grant to the University of Newcastle to establish the centre as part of the International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) to develop clinical epidemiologists in the Asia-Pacific region. Leeder was the director of a department of community medicine from 1986 to 1996. In Newcastle, his research interests were cardiovascular disease, asthma and tobacco. Leeder became Professor of Community Medicine at Westmead Hospital in western Sydney in 1986, and pursued research in heart disease and health promotion. His chair was originally in the Department of Community Medicine at the University of Sydney and then in the Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, which became the Sydney School of Public Health. After serving for two years as head of the Department of Public Health and Community Medicine at the University of Sydney, Leeder was dean of the Medical Faculty from 1996 to 2002. He oversaw the implementation of a new graduate educational program, decentralization of the Faculty to its schools, strategic development of research and the formation of an extensive rural-education network for medical students. Leeder worked at Columbia University's Earth Institute and Mailman School of Public Health in 2003-04 and developed a report, based on research data and scientific interpretation, of the economic consequences of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in developing economies. The report, \\"A Race against Time: the challenge of cardiovascular disease in developing economies\\", focussed on the macroeconomic consequences of CVD‚Äîparticularly on the fact that one-third of CVD deaths in many developing countries were occurring in people of working age. After returning from New York in 2004, Leeder directed the development of the Sydney node of the Menzies Centre for Health Policy from 2006 to 2012. He was appointed an officer in the Order of Australia in 2004. Leeder is chair of the Western Sydney Local Health Board, and his career in western Sydney began in 1986. Redevelopment of facilities in the health district are underway. An advocate for integrating care in the community with hospital services, he has advised federal and state governments. He was editor-in-chief of The Medical Journal of Australia (MJA) from January 2013 to May 2015. On 1 May 2015, it was learned that Leeder had been fired by the board of the Australasian Medical Publishing Company (AMPCo, the journal's publisher). Publishing and some editorial functions were to be outsourced to Elsevier, an international publishing company. As more information became available, the AMPCo board had apparently rejected Leeder's advice (on behalf of the MJA editorial staff) and not considered public concerns about Elsevier's business practices. Most of the editorial advisory committee and two deputy editors resigned in protest. Leeder has served on the University of Sydney Senate for several terms, had two double terms as national president of the Public Health Association, and one triennium as chair of the Health Advisory Committee of the NHMRC. He was a member of the Better Health Commission in development health goals and targets for Australia, the Scientific Advisory Committee and the Health and Hospitals Fund Advisory Board, directed the Western Sydney Local Health District's Research Network and chaired the New South Wales Advisory Committee on Prevention. Leeder was a member of the NSW Health Ministerial Advisory Committee from 2011 to 2014, and chaired the NSW State Committee of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in 2012 and 2013. He has been a medical journalist for forty years in mainstream media, medical newspapers and on television.  Personal life  Leeder lives in Sydney, and is married to Dr. Katharine Esson. He has three children: Nicholas, Robert and James. Leeder maintains a blog of his poetry.

Elected in 2018 as a member of the conservative Social Liberal Party before cutting ties with them, he has been in office since 1January 2019. He previously served in the country's Chamber of Deputies, representing the state of Rio de Janeiro between 1991 and 2018. Bolsonaro was born in the town of Glic√©rio, in the state of S√£o Paulo. He graduated from the Agulhas Negras Military Academy in 1977 and served in the Brazilian Army's field artillery and parachutist units. He became known to the public in 1986, when he wrote an article for Veja magazine criticizing low wages for military officers, after which he was arrested and detained for fifteen days. One year later, he was accused by the same magazine of planning to plant bombs in military units, which he denied. After a first degree conviction, he was acquitted by the Brazilian Supreme Military Court in 1988. He moved to the reserve in 1988 with the rank of captain and ran for the Rio de Janeiro City Council that same year, being elected while a member of the Christian Democratic Party. Bolsonaro was elected in 1990 to the lower chamber of Congress and was subsequently re- elected six times. During his 27-year tenure as a congressman, he became known for his strong support of national conservatism. He is a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage and homosexuality,LGBTQ Brazilians on edge after self- described 'homophobic' lawmaker elected president , NBC News abortion, affirmative action, drug liberalization and secularism. In foreign policy, he has advocated closer relations to the United States and Israel. During the 2018 presidential campaign, he started to advocate for economic liberal and pro-market policies. A polarizing and controversial politician, his views and comments, which have been described as far-right and populist in nature, have drawn both praise and criticism in Brazil. Bolsonaro announced his intention to run for president in March 2016 as a member of the Social Christian Party. However, he left the party in 2018 and joined the Social Liberal Party, and then launched his presidential campaign in August of that same year, with retired general Hamilton Mour√£o as his running mate. He portrayed himself as an outsider and a supporter of family values. He came in first place in the first round of the general election on 7October 2018, with Workers' Party candidate Fernando Haddad coming in second place. The two candidates faced a run-off on 28 October 2018, and Bolsonaro was elected with 55.1% of the popular vote. Bolsonaro placed army officers in key positions in his cabinet. Prior to his inauguration, he stated he would fill positions in his government based on technical qualifications rather than ideological sympathy. Despite this, during his presidency, many appointees saw themselves clashing ideologically with the government. His ministers of Justice and Education, the Secretary of Government, and the Postmaster General, among others, fell out of favor with the president. Bolsonaro focused on domestic affairs in his first months in office, dealing primarily with the fallout of 2014 Brazilian economic crisis. In his first year in office, the economy did recover, albeit slowly, while crime rates fell sharply. Multiple controversies marked the first years of his administration. In 2019, Bolsonaro left his party amid a confrontation with other members, and formed his own political organization. During his presidency, he rolled back protections for indigenous groups in the Amazon rainforest and facilitated its destruction through deforestation. Bolsonaro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil was criticized across the political spectrum: he sought to downplay the pandemic and its effects, opposed quarantine measures, and fired two health ministers, while Brazil's death toll increased rapidly. As a result, public opinion, which had been favourable towards him during his first year in office, turned negative throughout most of 2020.  Early life  Bolsonaro was born on 21 March 1955 in the town of Glic√©rio, in S√£o Paulo, in the southeast region of Brazil, to Percy Geraldo Bolsonaro and Olinda Bonturi.\\"Ele n√£o era de falar besteira', diz m√£e de Jair Bolsonaro\\" , revistacrescer.globo.com; accessed 28 April 2018. His family is mostly of Italian descent, with some German ancestry. On his father's side, he is the great-grandson of Italians from Veneto and Calabria. Bolsonaro's paternal grandfather's family comes from Veneto, more precisely the city of Anguillara Veneta, in the province of Padua. His great- grandfather, Vittorio Bolzonaro (the surname was originally written with a Z), was born on 12 April 1878. Vittorio's parents immigrated to Brazil when he was ten, together with his little siblings, Giovanna and Tranquillo. His German ancestry came from his father's maternal grandfather, Carl \\"Carlos\\" Hintze, born in Hamburg around 1876, who immigrated to Brazil in 1883. His maternal grandparents were born in the Italian city of Lucca, in Tuscany, and went to live in Brazil in the 1890s. Bolsonaro spent most of his childhood moving around S√£o Paulo with his family, living in the cities of Ribeira, Jundia√≠, and Sete Barras, before settling in the town of Eldorado, in the southern region of the state, in 1966, where he would grow up together with his five brothers. His first name is a tribute to Jair da Rosa Pinto, football player for Palmeiras at the time of Bolsonaro's birth and who celebrated his 34th birthday on the same day.  Military career  In his final years in high school, Bolsonaro was admitted to the Escola Preparat√≥ria de Cadetes do Ex√©rcito (the prep school of the Brazilian Army), where he entered in 1973. In 1974, he went to the Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras (Brazil's main military academy), graduating in 1977, as an Artillery officer. He served in the 9th Field Artillery Group, in Nioaque, Mato Grosso do Sul. Later he studied at the Army Physical Training School in Rio de Janeiro and served in the 21st Field Artillery Group and the 8th Paratrooper Field Artillery Group, from the Paratrooper Brigade, both in the same city. His superior officers described him as \\"aggressive\\" and having an \\"excessive ambition to get financial and economical gain\\". The assessment referred to Bolsonaro's attempt to mine gold in Bahia state; according to him, the activity was only a \\"hobby and mental hygiene\\". In 1987, he studied in the Officers Improvement School, where he made the Artillery Advanced Course. Bolsonaro's first rise to publicity came in 1986 when he gave an interview to the news magazine Veja. He complained about low salaries in the military and claimed that the High Command was firing officers due to budgetary cuts and not because they were displaying 'deviations of conduct', as the command was telling the press. Despite being reprimanded by his superiors, Bolsonaro received praise from fellow officers and wives of military men, becoming a household name for a lot of hardliners and right-wingers who were growing disenchanted with Brazil's new civilian democratic government. In October 1987, Bolsonaro faced a new accusation. The same Veja magazine reported that, with an Army colleague, he had plans to plant bombs in military units in Rio de Janeiro. After Bolsonaro called the allegation \\"a fantasy\\", the magazine published, in its subsequent edition, sketches in which the plan was detailed. The drawings had been allegedly produced by Bolsonaro himself. Official records unearthed by the newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo in 2018 detailed the case. After an investigation by an administrative military bureau named Justification Board, Bolsonaro was unanimously considered guilty. According to this board, Bolsonaro had a \\"serious personality deviation and a professional deformation\\", \\"lack of moral courage to leave the Army\\" and \\"lied throughout the process\\" when denying frequent contacts with the Veja magazine. The case was then analyzed by the Supreme Military Court. The General in charge of reporting the case voted for his acquittal, arguing that Bolsonaro had already been penalized for the initial article in Veja, that there was no testimonial evidence of his plans to plant bombs and that there were \\"deep contradictions in the four graphological exams\\", two of which failed to conclude that Bolsonaro was indeed the author of the sketches. He ended up acquitted by the majority of the court (9x 4votes). In December 1988, just after this ruling, Bolsonaro left the Army to begin his political career. In total, he served in the military for fifteen years, reaching the rank of Captain.  Political career   Councilor of Rio de Janeiro (1989‚Äì1991)  Bolsonaro as Rio de Janeiro city councilor in March 1990. In October of the same year, he was elected Federal Deputy for Rio. Bolsonaro entered politics in 1988, getting elected as city councilor in Rio de Janeiro, representing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). According to his biography written by his son Fl√°vio, Bolsonaro \\"was a candidate for councilor because it happened to be the only option he had at the moment to avoid persecution by some superiors. His entry into politics happened by chance, for his desire was to continue in his military career\\". He spent only two years in the Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro. He was described as a quiet, discreet and conservative councilor, and showed little participation. His term as councilor was used mainly to give visibility to military causes, such as retirement benefits for former officers.  Federal Deputy for Rio de Janeiro (1991‚Äì2018)  In the 1990 elections, he was elected as a federal deputy for the Christian Democratic Party. Bolsonaro served seven consecutive terms, from 1991 to 2018. He has been affiliated with several other Brazilian political parties over the years. In 2014, he was the congressman who gained the most votes in Rio de Janeiro, with 465,000 votes. In his 27 years of service in the Brazilian National Congress, he put forward one constitutional amendment and at least 171 bills, passing two of them into law.\\"Bolsonaro aprova dois projetos em 26 anos de Congresso\\" . Page accessed on 7 June 2018. Bolsonaro, who claims to be persecuted by the left-wing parties, said most congressmen do not vote according to their agenda, but \\"by who the author of the bill is\\".\\"C√¢mara aprova pela primeira vez emenda de Jair Bolsonaro\\" . Page accessed on 1 August 2018. In January 2018, Bolsonaro abandoned the Social Christian Party and switched to the Social Liberal Party (PSL). Following Bolsonaro's arrival, the PSL adopted conservative and right-wing positions, and its social liberal group Livres announced their departure from the party.  Presidential campaign (2018)  On 22 July 2018, Bolsonaro was officially nominated by the Social Liberal Party (PSL) as its presidential candidate for the 2018 election. Bolsonaro was also endorsed by the Brazilian Labour Renewal Party. His coalition name was \\"Brazil above everything, God above everyone\\" (Brasil acima de tudo, Deus acima de todos). Though contested by two lawsuits, the Superior Electoral Court of Brazil deferred them and his candidacy was made official on 6August. Bolsonaro announced in August that Ant√¥nio Hamilton Mour√£o, a retired army general, would be his running mate for the upcoming election. Bolsonaro supporters in London, 7October 2018 According to political pundits, early in the campaign, Bolsonaro moderated his tone, taking a less aggressive and confrontational style. Economically, he started to support the idea of less government intervention in the economy (in contrast to what he had stated in the past, when he defended developmentalists policies). On the other hand, he maintained his tough stance on crime and his defense of \\"traditional family values\\". Bolsonaro also said he planned to cut taxes across the board, particularly on inheritances and businesses, in order to generate growth and tackle unemployment. He also promised more austerity measures and cuts in government spending, but had difficulty naming the areas where he would make these cuts. He also mentioned he would work to diminish the size and bureaucracy of the federal government by enacting a wide variety of deregulation measures. Bolsonaro's promises to restore security amid record high crime and to stamp out the country's rampant political corruption won him huge popular support. In October, Bolsonaro announced he would name liberal economist Paulo Guedes to serve as his finance minister. On 9 August 2018, he attended the first presidential debate of the year, organized by the TV network Rede Bandeirantes. A week later, there was another debate at RedeTV!. On 28 August, he gave an interview to Jornal Nacional, Brazil's best rated prime time news program, at Rede Globo. Jair Bolsonaro was the first candidate for the presidency to raise over R$1 million in donations from the public during the 2018 campaign. In the first 59 days, he amassed an average of R$17,000 per day in donations. After the Workers' Party candidate Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva was arrested in April 2018, Bolsonaro became the front-runner, according to all major opinion polls, for that year's presidential election. A Datafolha poll from September, for instance, showed Bolsonaro as the leading candidate in the first round with 28% of vote intentions; however, run-off scenarios showed Bolsonaro losing to opponents Geraldo Alckmin, Fernando Haddad and Ciro Gomes and tying with Marina Silva. Another poll from Datafolha, conducted in the week leading up to election day, showed a considerable surge for Bolsonaro, who had 40% of vote intentions, or 36% when null or blank vote intentions were included. Fernando Haddad came in second with 25%, and Ciro Gomes in third with 15%. The first round of the election occurred on 7October 2018. Bolsonaro finished in first place with 46% of the popular vote (or 49.2 million people). Since he failed to win overall 50% of valid votes needed to win outright, he faced the second most voted, Fernando Haddad from the Workers' Party, in a runoff held on 28 October 2018. Bolsonaro is known for his finger-gun gesture, which he used during the presidential campaign. After the first round, when his victory looked certain, Bolsonaro gave a speech by videolink to thousands of supporters who gathered at Paulista Avenue, in S√£o Paulo. In the speech, he threatened to arrest, purge or kill \\"reds\\" and \\"petralhas\\" (a derogatory term for Worker's Party's members), and promised that members of the social movements MST and MTST would be treated as \\"terrorists\\". He said: \\"This time, the clean-up will be even greater. This group [\\"reds\\"], if they want to stay, will have to abide by our laws... These red outlaws will be banned from our homeland. Either they go overseas, or they go to jail... Petralhada, you all go to the edge of the beach. It will be a cleaning never seen in the history of Brazil\\". The \\"edge of the beach\\", it was later confirmed by a Bolsonaro aide, was a reference to a Navy base at Restinga da Marambaia, in Rio de Janeiro State, where dissidents of the Brazilian military dictatorship were tortured and killed by the regime. The speech was widely condemned by rivals, journalists and politicians. Bolsonaro won the runoff election with 55.13% of the votes, and was elected the 38th president of Brazil. He took office on 1January 2019. During the campaign, academics repeatedly raised concerns on the consequences of Bolsonaro's rise for the Brazilian democracy. Writing for the news magazine Foreign Policy, Federico Finchelstein, a historian at the New School for Social Research who specializes in fascism, said: \\"Bolsonaro's vocabulary recalls the rhetoric behind Nazi policies of persecution and victimization. But does sounding like a Nazi make him a Nazi? Insomuch as he believes in holding elections, he is not there yet. However, things could change quickly if he gains power.\\" Jason Stanley, a Yale philosopher who has published widely on Nazism, argued in an interview that Bolsonaro \\"uses more tactics associated to fascism than [the] American president Donald Trump\\". Harvard's Steven Levitsky stated that Bolsonaro \\"is clearly authoritarian\\", but not a fascist. Similar concerns were raised by analysts in Portugal and Brazil. Others, such as Marxist historian Perry Anderson, dismissed the \\"fascist\\" and \\"populist\\" labels altogether. Another highly controversial aspect of the campaign was the alleged use of illegal digital communication strategies by some of Bolsonaro's most important financial supporters. According to an investigation by Folha de S.Paulo, one of Brazil's best selling newspapers, \\"Bolsonaro has been getting an illegal helping hand from a group of Brazilian entrepreneurs who are bankrolling a campaign to bombard WhatsApp users with fake news about [Fernando] Haddad.\\" The suspicions led to a formal investigation by electoral authorities and the Federal Police; Bolsonaro and allies denied any wrongdoing. Another controversial point was that Ta√≠se Feij√≥ who is currently an adviser in Bolsonaro's government was among those paid to feed fake news to his supporters. = Stabbing attack during campaign = The moment Bolsonaro was attacked at the Juiz de Fora rally Bolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen on 6September 2018 while campaigning and interacting with supporters in the city of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais. At first, his son Fl√°vio Bolsonaro stated that his father's wounds were only superficial and he was recovering in the hospital, but Fl√°vio later stated that the wounds seemed worse than initially thought and his father most likely would not be able to start campaigning personally before the end of the first round. He tweeted about his father's condition, explaining that the perforation reached parts of the liver, lung, and intestine. He also stated that Bolsonaro had lost a large amount of blood, arriving at the hospital with severe hypotension (his blood pressure was 10/3, equivalent to 100/30 mmHg), but that he had since stabilized. The attack was condemned by most of the other candidates in the presidential race, from both sides of the political spectrum, and by then current Brazilian president Michel Temer. The day after the attack, Bolsonaro was transferred to the Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, in S√£o Paulo, after a request from his family. According to the doctors, he was in an \\"extremely stable\\" condition. Police arrested and identified the attacker as Ad√©lio Bispo de Oliveira, who, according to security agents, claimed he was on \\"a mission from God\\". He had been a member of the Socialism and Liberty Party between 2007 and 2014. His social media posts included political criticisms against both Bolsonaro and Temer. However, an initial investigation by the Federal Police concluded that Ad√©lio had no help from political organizations and acted alone. A medical report produced for a second investigation about the murder attempt concluded that Ad√©lio is mentally disturbed, having a \\"permanent paranoid delusional disorder\\" which, according to the Brazilian law, prevents him from being considered legally liable for his actions. On 29 September, a month after the attack, Bolsonaro was released from the hospital and returned to his home in Rio de Janeiro. However, his condition prevented him from returning to the campaign trail for the remainder of the first round of the presidential election. = Protests = Demonstration against Bolsonaro in Porto Alegre, part of the Ele N√£o movement In the same weekend he left the hospital, thousands of people took the streets in dozens of cities in Brazil to protest against Bolsonaro and his political stances, chanting \\"'\\" (\\"Not him\\"). There were also rallies in support of the candidate in sixteen states.  Presidency (2019‚Äìpresent)  Michel Temer with Bolsonaro and his wife Michelle during the inauguration on 1January 2019 Bolsonaro was sworn in as President of the Republic on 1January 2019, succeeding Michel Temer. Bolsonaro began his cabinet formation before winning the presidency, having chosen economist Paulo Guedes as his Economy minister and astronaut Marcos Pontes as his Science and Technology minister. Bolsonaro initially said his cabinet would be composed of 15 members; this figure later rose to 22 when he announced his final minister, Ricardo Salles, in December. His predecessor, Michel Temer, had a cabinet of 29 members. Bolsonaro's cabinet is composed of 16 ministers, two cabinet-level positions, and four presidency secretaries including Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni. Bolsonaro's ministries include Operation Car Wash judge S√©rgio Moro as Justice minister and congresswoman Tereza Cristina as Agriculture minister. Bolsonaro has stripped the indigenous affairs agency FUNAI of the responsibility to identify and demarcate indigenous lands. He argued that those territories have very tiny isolated populations, who would be controlled by NPOs, and proposed to integrate them into the larger Brazilian society. Critics feared that such integration would lead the Brazilian natives to suffer cultural assimilation. Argentine President Mauricio Macri was the first foreign leader to be received by Bolsonaro on a state visit to Bras√≠lia since he assumed the Brazilian presidency. Bolsonaro with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, June 2019 The second inauguration of Nicol√°s Maduro in Venezuela took place nine days after Bolsonaro's inauguration. The disputed results of the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election led to the Venezuelan presidential crisis, as the National Assembly rejected the results, considered Maduro an illegitimate ruler since his first term of office ended, and appointed Juan Guaid√≥ as acting president. Bolsonaro did not attend Maduro's inauguration and recognized Guaid√≥ as the legitimate ruler of Venezuela, alongside Mauricio Macri from Argentina and Donald Trump from the US, among others. He said that \\"We will continue doing everything possible to re-establish order, democracy and freedom there\\". After allegations of campaign-finance fraud, Bolsonaro fired Gustavo Bebianno, a top adviser and general secretary for the president. His party was accused of diverting public campaign funds to candidates who did not run for office. Since his election, his popularity is steadily declining. A Datafolha survey, published on 21 May 2019, showed that 34% of respondents described Bolsonaro's administration as \\"great or good\\"; 26% as \\"regular\\", 36% as \\"bad or awful\\", while 4% did not respond. This was the first time more Brazilians rejected the politics of Bolsonaro than affirmed it. On 7 July 2020, Bolsonaro revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, Bolsonaro and his administration have been accused of downplaying the crisis while the number of people infected by the virus in the country climbed exponentially by mid-2020. The president claimed that the coronavirus is no more deadly than the \\"common flu\\" and that his priority is the economic recovery of the nation rather than the health crisis. He has constantly accused political opponents and the press of exaggerating the threat of the virus. On 25 July 2020, Bolsonaro announced that he had tested negative for COVID-19 in a fourth test since being diagnosed, although the following week he indicated that he had also started suffering from \\"mold in the lung\\". Even so, he stated his opposition to mandatory vaccination against COVID-19. In August 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, Bolsonaro's popularity bounced back and showed signs of recovery, with the president registering his highest approval rating since his inauguration.  Political positions  Bolsonaro in 2010 Bolsonaro's political views have been described as nationalist and populist in nature, and he himself as an advocate of far- right policies. His supporters, however, claim that his views are more aligned with traditional right-wing conservatism. His electorate is mainly formed by adults above the age of 34, the working middle to upper class (mainly in the southeast region of the country), conservatives in general, college graduates, some centrists and the Christian right. According to some polls, Bolsonaro's main support comes from the southeast, central-west and south regions of Brazil. His voters are usually male and white, with a noticeable gender gap, with Bolsonaro polling poorly among female voters (mustering only 18% support with this demographic). Just before the 2018 election, however, it was reported that female support for him had risen to 27%. Bolsonaro is viewed as a pro-life, anti-establishment and pro-gun politician, voicing opposition to most forms of gun control legislation, arguing that law-abiding citizens have the right to self-defense, especially those living in rural areas. According to The Washington Post, \\"Homicides hit a record high of 63,880 last year [...] Bolsonaro's solution is zero tolerance. He has called for police to use more lethal force and wants to relax gun laws so that average citizens can defend themselves.\\" Bolsonaro often rejects accusations made against him of misogyny and homophobia, and says he is not \\"far-right\\", but simply right-wing. Bolsonaro was one of the key political figures in support of the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff and the 2015‚Äì16 protests against corruption, galvanizing a lot of support for his cause among the populace. Jair Bolsonaro is known for his strong opposition to left-wing policies. Most notably, he has been a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, environmental regulations, abortion, affirmative action (particularly racial quotas), immigration (particularly from Haiti, Africa and the Middle East, which he once called \\"the scum of humanity\\"), drug liberalization, land reforms, and secularism at the federal level, among other things. He has also made statements in defense of the Brazilian military regime (a dictatorship known for constant human rights violations). He argues that torture is a \\"legitimate practice\\" and says that he would try to pass new legislation regarding the introduction of life imprisonment to the Brazilian penal code. Bolsonaro supports the privatization of state-owned companies and advocates free market policies, although critics have stated that his policy-making record does not in fact show him to be a supporter of economic liberalism. In a 2017 interview with journalist Claudio Dantas Sequeira from O Antagonista, Bolsonaro said that his views are directly aligned with the centrist to right-wing United States citizens' views on gun ownership, abortion, gender politics, and trade, despite the \\"left-leaning media frenzy\\" against him. He reiterated that he intends to reverse some disarmament laws, improve public security, and also improve trade ties with the United States, which he said were broken during Lula da Silva's and Dilma Rousseff's administrations. Bolsonaro supported the European Union‚ÄìMercosur Free Trade Agreement, which would form one of the world's largest free trade areas. Bolsonaro has, during his long political career, expressed views regarded as being far-right. He has made statements that some people considered insulting, homophobic, violence-inciting, misogynistic, sexist, racist or anti-refugee. Other controversial political stances expressed by Bolsonaro have been the defense of the death penalty (which is currently banned under the Constitution of Brazil of 1988) and of radical interventionism in Brazil by the military, along with an imposition of a Brazilian military government. Journalist Glenn Greenwald called Bolsonaro \\"the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world\\". News.com.au wondered whether Bolsonaro was \\"the world's most repulsive politician\\". British news magazine The Economist referred to him as a \\"radical\\", \\"religious nationalist\\", a \\"right-wing demagogue\\", and \\"apologist of dictators\\". Federico Finchelstein, scholar on fascism and populism, has considered Bolsonaro, as he would link violence to austerity and neoliberal economic ideas, to be the most similar leader to Augusto Pinochet to come out from the young South American democracies. Bolsonaro is an open admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump. During Bolsonaro's campaign, some observers saw similarities between the Brazilian president-elect and the U.S. president's ideals, hardline attacks and a reputation for incendiary rhetoric, as well as social media presence. Because of this, Bolsonaro has been called the Brazilian equivalent of Trump or the \\"Trump of the Tropics\\".  Views on the Brazilian military dictatorship  Eduardo hold up a Brazilian flag during a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1964 military coup d'√©tat, 1April 2014. Throughout his political career, Bolsonaro has made several admiring comments about the U.S.‚Äìsupported Brazilian military dictatorship which ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. He said in 1993, eight years after the return of democracy, that the military regime had \\"led to a more sustainable and prosperous Brazil\\". Bolsonaro has publicly referred to the military dictatorship as a \\"glorious\\" period in Brazil's history, and that under the military dictatorship, Brazil enjoyed \\"20 years of order and progress\\". In December 2008, Bolsonaro said that \\"the error of the dictatorship was that it tortured, but did not kill\\". Bolsonaro has also repeatedly made admiring comments about a number of other Latin American dictatorships. He praised Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori as a role model for his use of military intervention via self-coup against the judiciary and legislature. In a 1998 interview with Veja magazine, Bolsonaro praised the Chilean dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, and said the Pinochet regime, which killed over 3,000 Chilean citizens, \\"should have killed more people\\". In 1999, Bolsonaro said that Hugo Ch√°vez represented \\"hope for Latin America\\", comments that became a matter of controversy during the 2018 campaign, when Bolsonaro presented himself as a harsh critic of Chavismo. In 2019, already in power, Bolsonaro commended Paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner as a \\"visionary\\" and \\"statesman\\", drawing immediate criticism, particularly due to multiple allegations of pedophilia against Stroessner. Speaking before his vote in favor of President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment amid the massive corruption scandal, Bolsonaro paid homage to Colonel Brilhante Ustra, an agent of Brazil's military dictatorship, and announced on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies that he was dedicating his pro-impeachment vote to Ustra's memory. Ustra had headed the DOI-CODI torture unit where Rousseff was allegedly tortured during the military dictatorship. Left-wing deputy Jean Wyllys spat at him after his statement during the same session. The congressman claimed to have suffered homophobic offenses from Jair Bolsonaro and his allies. In a TV interview with C√¢mera Aberta in the 1990s, Bolsonaro said that if he ever became President, he would use this as an opportunity to shut down the National Congress and instigate a military coup himself. , he appeared to have changed his mind, and said that if someone becomes the head of the country, it would be through voting. In March 2019, Bolsonaro stated that the 1964 coup d'√©tat that overthrew President Jo√£o Goulart was not a coup, and that March 31, the day the coup was installed, should be \\"properly commemorated\\".  Foreign policy  Bolsonaro with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House, Washington, D.C., 19 March 2019 During the 2018 presidential campaign, Bolsonaro said he would make considerable changes to Brazil's foreign relations, saying that the \\"Itamaraty needs to be in service of the values that were always associated with the Brazilian people\\". He also said that the country should stop \\"praising dictators\\" and attacking democracies, such as the United States, Israel and Italy. In early 2018, he affirmed that his \\"trip to the five democratic countries the United States, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan showed who we will be and we would like to join good people\\". Bolsonaro has shown distrust towards China throughout the presidential campaign claiming they \\"[want to] buy Brazil\\", although Brazil recorded a US$20 billion trade surplus with China in 2018, and China is only the 13th largest source of foreign direct investment into Brazil. Bolsonaro said he wishes to continue to have business with the Chinese but he also said that Brazil should \\"make better [economic] deals\\" with other countries, with no \\"ideological agenda\\" behind it. His stance towards China has also been interpreted by some as an attempt to curry favor from the Trump administration to garner concessions from the US. However, Bolsonaro has mostly changed his position on China after he took office, saying that the two countries were ‚Äúborn to walk together‚Äù during his visit to Beijing in October 2019. He has also said that Brazil will stay out of the ongoing China-U.S. trade war. Bolsonaro said that his first international trip as president will be to Israel. Bolsonaro also said that the State of Palestine \\"is not a country, so there should be no embassy here\\", adding that \\"you don't negotiate with terrorists.\\" The announcement was warmly received by the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, who welcomed Bolsonaro to Israel in March 2019 during the final weeks of a re-election campaign, but was met with condemnation from the Arab League, which warned Bolsonaro it could damage diplomatic ties. \\"I love Israel,\\" Bolsonaro said in Hebrew at a welcoming ceremony, with Netanyahu at his side, at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport. Bolsonaro with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October 2019 Bolsonaro has also praised U.S. President Donald Trump and his foreign policy., with Bolsonaro being named ‚Äòthe tropical Trump‚Äô. Bolsonaro's son Eduardo has indicated that Brazil should distance itself from Iran, sever ties with Nicol√°s Maduro's government in Venezuela and relocate Brazil's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Bolsonaro is widely considered to be the most pro-American candidate in Brazil since the 1980s. PSL members have said that if elected, he will dramatically improve relations between the United States and Brazil. During an October 2017 campaign rally in Miami, he saluted the American flag and led chants of \\"USA! USA!\\" to a large crowd. U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton praised Bolsonaro as a 'like-minded' partner and said his victory was a \\"positive sign\\" for Latin America. At the regional level, he praised the Argentine President Mauricio Macri for ending the 12-years rule of N√©stor and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, which he saw as similar to Lula and Rousseff. Although he does not have plans of leaving the Mercosur, he criticized that it gave priority to ideological issues instead of economic ones. A staunch anti- communist, Bolsonaro has condemned Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro and the current regime in that island. Bolsonaro praised British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, saying that he had learned from Churchill: \\"Patriotism, love for your fatherland, respect for your flag ‚Äì something that has been lost over the last few years here in Brazil... and governing through example, especially at that difficult moment of the Second World War.\\" Bolsonaro said he's open to the possibility of hosting a U.S. military base in Brazil to counter Russian influence in the region. With the intention of the U.S. President Donald Trump to make Brazil a NATO member in March 2019, Bolsonaro said: \\"the discussions with the United States will begin in the coming months\\". Bolsonaro with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Bras√≠lia, November 2019 With formal support from the United States for Brazil's entry on OECD in May 2019, Bolsonaro said that \\"currently, all 36 members of the organization support the entry of the country, fruit of confidence in the new Brazil being built, more free, open and fair\\". In October 2019, on a state visit to China, Bolsonaro announced the end of the need for visas for Chinese and Indian entry into Brazil. The Brazilian government had already removed the need for visas for people from the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia. On 25 January 2020, on his first state visit to India, Bolsonaro said that Brazil will continue to demand a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, and that will remain a priority on his government. Together with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that \\"Brazil and India are two great countries, among the ten largest economies in the world, that together have 1.5 billion inhabitants, are democratic countries. We believe that it will be good for the world if Brazil and India join this group\\". As the head of the state, he became the chief guest at the Delhi Republic Day parade on 26 January 2020. On 7 March 2020, Bolsonaro was hosted by the U.S. President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago for a working dinner, where the two leaders discussed the U.S.-led effort to oust Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro, a future trade deal and peace for the Middle East, also Trump reaffirmed his interest in upgrading the American military alliance with Brazil, suggesting give to the country a full NATO membership, as part of an effort to fortify the Western Hemisphere against Russian and Chinese influence.  Environment  Brazil has the world's largest tropical rainforest in the Amazon basin. According to The Washington Post, \\"Bolsonaro is a powerful supporter of agribusiness [...] and is likely to favor profits over preservation. [...] Bolsonaro has chafed at foreign pressure to safeguard the Amazon rainforest, and he served notice to international nonprofit groups such as the World Wildlife Fund that he will not tolerate their agendas in Brazil. He has also come out strongly against lands reserved for indigenous tribes. Bolsonaro advisers additionally say that he plans to expand nuclear and hydroelectric power into the Amazon.\\" Bolsonaro with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Western Wall Bolsonaro rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the Paris Agreement during his campaign. Even before taking office, he backed out of Brazil's offer to host the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference. Ernesto Ara√∫jo, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs appointed by Bolsonaro, has called global warming a plot by \\"cultural Marxists\\" and has eliminated the Climate Change Division of the ministry. Two departments of the Ministry of the Environment dealing with climate change and mitigation and one dealing with deforestation have also been eliminated. In April 2019, the American Museum of Natural History canceled an event honoring Bolsonaro after facing heavy public criticism, including from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. The museum's directorate justified its decision in a statement, \\"With mutual respect for the work and goals of our organizations, we jointly agreed that the Museum is not the optimal location for the Brazilian-Am. Chamber of Commerce gala dinner. This traditional event will go forward at another location on the original date and time.\\" Bolsonaro has supported plans to open the Reserva Nacional do Cobre e Associados (Renca) Amazonian reserve in Brazil's northern states of Par√° and Amap√° to commercial mining. Bolsonaro, French President Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman at the 2019 G20 Osaka summit Destruction of the Amazon rainforest increased by 88% for the month of June 2019, during Bolsonaro's first year as president, as compared with the previous year, according to National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Bolsonaro has rejected the agency's data as false. The IPSE director was fired after he rebutted Bolsonaro's criticism of IPSE. The Bolsonaro administration has decreased government efforts which combat illegal logging, ranching and mining in the Amazon. Government enforcement actions such as fines, warnings and the confiscation or destruction of illegal equipment in protected areas have decreased by 20% in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. In June 2019, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was concerned about deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and would seek \\"straight talk with Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro on the upcoming G20 summit in Osaka\\". She also said that the situation \\"does not affect the imminent free trade agreement between Mercosur and the EU\\". After French President Emmanuel Macron conditioned France's support for a trade accord between the European Union and Mercosul to Brazil remaining in the Paris Agreement, Bolsonaro said that Brazil \\"will not leave the Paris Agreement\\" in their meeting at the G20 Osaka, also inviting Macron to visit Brazil's Amazon region. Bolsonaro with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2019 During a conversation with journalists in July 2019, Bolsonaro lashed out at European leaders, saying that the Amazon belongs to Brazil and European countries can mind their own business because they have already \\"destroyed their environment\\". He also said: \\"We preserve more [rainforest] than anyone. No country in the world has the moral right to talk about Amazon.\\" During the 2019 Brazil wildfires, Bolsonaro in August 2019 accused (without providing any evidence) that non-governmental organizations had started the forest fires, due to a reduction of government funding to the NGOs. Environmental and climate experts described Bolsonaro's accusation as a \\"smokescreen\\" to hide his own government's rolling back of protections for the Amazon. They instead attributed the fires to farmers clearing land. On 22 August 2019, Bolsonaro accused Macron of having \\"a misplaced colonialist mentality in the 21st century\\" in reference to criticism by the French president, where he called on G7 leaders to discuss the Amazon crisis. He later tweeted \\"I regret that the President Macron seeks to exploit an internal issue in Brazil and other Amazonian countries for personal political gains.\\" He added that \\"the Brazilian government remains open to dialogue, based on objective data and mutual respect.\\" Macron stated he will refuse to ratify the European Union‚ÄìMercosur Free Trade Agreement unless Brazil commits to protecting the environment. Bolsonaro's Facebook comments mocking Brigitte Macron's looks escalated the diplomatic clash, which was dubbed \\"the worst diplomatic crisis between France and Brazil in 40 years\\". Macron pointed out that the French overseas territory of French Guiana on the northern coast of South America is France's biggest land border.  Christianity and secularism  Bolsonaro speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019 Bolsonaro is a member of the Catholic Church (while his wife and one of his sons are Evangelical Christians). However, according to The New Yorker reporter Jon Lee Anderson \\"he had himself baptized as an evangelical [Protestant] early in his campaign, by being ceremonially dunked in the Jordan River.\\"Jon Lee Anderson, \\"Southern Strategy,\\" The New Yorker, April 1, 2019. He is reported to have attended a Baptist church for 10 years. In a 2017 speech, Bolsonaro stated, \\"God above everything. There is no such thing as a secular state. The state is Christian, and any minority that is against this has to change, if they can.\\" He later evolved his position to maintaining the country a secular state during the first round of the Brazilian presidential elections: \\"We are going to make a government for everyone, regardless of religion. Even for atheists. We have almost 5% of atheists in Brazil, and they have the same needs that others have.\\"  Views on women  In an interview with Zero Hora in 2015, Bolsonaro argued that men and women should not receive the same salaries, because women get pregnant, adding that he believes federal law mandating paid maternity leave harms work productivity. Bolsonaro has denied saying that women should receive less than men; he claims it was statistical data by IBGE. In a public speech in April 2017, Bolsonaro said he had five children, that the first four were male and that for the fifth he produced a daughter out of \\"a moment of weakness\\". Bolsonaro arguing with Federal Deputy Maria do Ros√°rio in the Chamber of Deputies, 14 September 2016 Bolsonaro provoked controversy for a series of remarks made to and about Federal Deputy and former Human Rights Minister Maria do Ros√°rio. During a Congressional debate, Bolsonaro said that minors should be treated as adults if they commit heinous crimes such as murder or rape, to which Maria do Ros√°rio responded by calling him a \\"rapist\\". Bolsonaro then stated that Congresswoman Ros√°rio was \\"not worth raping; she is very ugly\\". The remarks drew considerable condemnation throughout Brazil. In the aftermath of these remarks, Bolsonaro was tried and convicted in a Federal court in September 2015 on counts of hedonic damages against Ros√°rio. In June 2016, the Federal Supreme Court responded to a complaint filed by the Attorney General and decided to open two criminal actions against Bolsonaro. The Supreme Court ruled that he had potentially incited rape and defamed the honor of his fellow Deputy. He faced a penalty of up to six months of jail and a fine. Ultimately in August 2017, an appellate court upheld a lower court's verdict which found Bolsonaro guilty and sentenced him to pay a fine to Ros√°rio of R$10,000 (roughly equivalent to US$2,500). This lawsuit was dismissed by the Supreme Federal Court as Bolsonaro was inaugurated as president in 2019 and acquired immunity from prosecution.  Views on homosexuality  Gay Pride parade in S√£o Paulo, June 2011 In a June 2011 interview with Playboy, Bolsonaro said that \\"I would be incapable of loving a gay son\\", and added that he would prefer any gay son of his \\"to die in an accident\\". In the same interview, Bolsonaro said that if a gay couple moved in next door to him, it would lower the market value of his house. In a July 2011 interview with the magazine √âpoca, Bolsonaro said that he would \\"fight to prevent the distribution of the 'gay kit'\\" [a set of guidelines proposed by UNESCO to promote the rights of the LGBT community in primary schools] because \\"their intention is to promote homosexuality, which is an affront to the family structure, and if that makes me prejudiced, then I'm prejudiced and very proud of it\\". In the 2013 BBC documentary Out There, by British actor Stephen Fry, Bolsonaro said that \\"no father is ever proud of having a gay son,\\" and that \\"we Brazilians do not like homosexuals.\\" In a 2011 interview with Jornal de Not√≠cias, Bolsonaro linked homosexuality to pedophilia, claiming that \\"many of the children who are adopted by gay couples will be abused by these couples\\". He further argued that Brazil does not need legislation specifically targeting homophobia, because \\"most homosexuals are murdered by their respective pimps at hours when good citizens are already asleep\\". In a May 2002 interview with the Folha de S.Paulo, Bolsonaro told the newspaper, \\"If I see two men kissing in the street, I will beat them.\\" He then publicly defended beating gay children by saying: \\"If your child starts to become like that, a little gay, you take a whip and you change their behavior.\\" Bolsonaro and his son, Eduardo, together with fellow congressman Marco Feliciano, watching as a couple of protesters for LGBT rights kiss on the floor of the Committee on Culture of the Chamber of Deputies, May 2016 In a video interview for Vice with openly lesbian actress Ellen Page, Page asked Bolsonaro if he thinks she should have been beaten as a child, in response to his public statements that gay children should be beaten. In response, Bolsonaro said to Page, \\"You are very nice. If I were a cadet in the military academy and saw you on the street, I would whistle at you. All right? You are very pretty.\\" Bolsonaro added, \\"Over time, due to liberal habits, drugs, with women also working, the number of homosexuals has really increased.\\" On 9 November 2017, the Court of Justice for the State of Rio de Janeiro sentenced Bolsonaro to pay a fine of R$150,000 for hate speech because of televised comments he made in 2011 to the CQC TV program, when Bolsonaro stated that \\"there is no risk\\" of his family producing a homosexual child because his children had a \\"good education\\". Judge Luciana Teixeira said that the deputy had abused his right of free expression to commit a wrongful act. \\"You cannot deliberately attack and humiliate, ignoring the principles of equality, just because you invoke freedom of expression,\\" said the judge. However, on 11 January 2016, when he began to present himself as a pre-candidate to the Presidency of Brazil, Bolsonaro began to moderate his discourse on gay people by publishing a video on his official YouTube channel: > I have nothing to do with anyone's behavior. If the man and the woman later > decide to live with their partner, to form a couple, to live with a same-sex > person, go and be happy. But we cannot admit that, by our omission in the > Parliament, children become homosexuals in the future, or have such > homosexual behavior in the future, by the influence of school. That is > inadmissible. Since then, Bolsonaro claims he has nothing against gays and that he fights only the \\"gay kit\\" in schools. On 4October 2018, for example, Bolsonaro said: > Each person, after a certain age, owner of their acts, will take care of > their life. For six-year-old children, it cannot be. A father does not want > to come home and see his son playing with a doll by the influence of school. > Homosexuals will be happy if I become president. That same month, shortly before the first round of the Brazilian presidential elections, he said: \\"We are going to make a government for everybody. For gays, and some gays are fathers, who are mothers. It is a work for everyone\\". After being elected president, when asked by William Bonner in the Jornal Nacional about what he would say to those who are more prejudiced and aggressive against gays, Bolsonaro replied: \\"The aggression against a fellow man has to be punished in the way of law. And if [such aggression is committed] for a reason like this, you have to have your sentence increased.\\"  Views on political violence  Federal Senate, March 2016. On multiple occasions, Bolsonaro has publicly endorsed physical violence as a legitimate and necessary form of political action. In 1999, when he was 44 years old and a representative in the Brazilian Congress, Bolsonaro said during a TV interview that the only way of \\"changing\\" Brazil was by \\"killing thirty thousand people, beginning with Fernando Henrique Cardoso\\" (then President of Brazil). During the 2018 campaign, he stated during a rally in Acre that the local \\"petralhas\\" (a derogatory term for members of the Workers' Party) would be \\"shot\\"; according to his aides, the statement was a \\"joke\\". One week before the second round, Bolsonaro said during a speech that in his administration \\"petralhas\\" and \\"reds\\" (i.e. leftists) would be arrested, purged or taken to the \\"corner of the beach\\", a term that was later revealed to mean a Navy base where dissidents of the Brazilian military dictatorship were murdered. In 1999, talking about Chico Lopes, a former president of the Brazilian Central Bank who invoked his right to remain silent during a Congress hearing, Bolsonaro declared himself in favour of torture in this sort of situation. Asked about this phrase years later, Bolsonaro said: \\"Ask the father of a kidnapped child what he would like him to do to discover [where the kid is]. You have to take brutal measures, which some consider torture\\".  Birth control for the poor  Bolsonaro provoked considerable controversy for public remarks made in July 2008, where he proposed to provide poor people with birth control methods, who he suggested might be too uneducated to understand family planning education. Bolsonaro said: > I wish Brazil had a family planning program. It's not even worthy to talk > about education when most of these [poor] people are not prepared to receive > education, therefore they won't educate themselves. Only rigid birth control > can save us from chaos. An educated man and woman will hardly desire an > extra child with the sole purpose of engaging in a social welfare assistance > program [as it is nowadays]. We need to adopt a rigid birth control policy. > We can't make demagogic speeches any longer, proposing bills and means of > government to support these poor people [who] are increasingly proliferating > throughout the country. [...] People who aren't prepared to have children, > shouldn't have them. This is what I stand for and I'm not worried about > getting votes in the future. It's past time to discuss a policy to contain > this demographic explosion, otherwise, we'll keep voting in this Chamber > only matters such as Bolsa Fam√≠lia, loans for the poor, gas vouchers, etc. > Methods [of birth control] have to be provided for those who, unfortunately, > are ignorant and have no means to control their offspring. Because we [as > upper-middle class] can control ours. Poor people don't control [theirs]. As a Congressman, Bolsonaro put forward three bills trying to remove \\"virtually all\\" legal restrictions to surgical sterilisation via the public health system, including the reduction of \\"the minimum age of sterilization to 21 years\\". None of the bills were voted.  Personal life  Bolsonaro and two of his sons, Eduardo and Fl√°vio, in the late 1980s Bolsonaro has been married three times and has five children. His first wife was Rog√©ria Nantes Braga (with whom he has three sons: Fl√°vio, Carlos and Eduardo). His second marriage was with Ana Cristina Valle (with whom he has a son, Renan). In 2007, he married his third and current wife Michelle de Paula Firmo Reinaldo (with whom he has a daughter, Laura). While working in Congress, Bolsonaro hired Michelle as a secretary and over the next two years she received unusual promotions and her salary more than tripled. He was forced to fire her after the Supreme Federal Court ruled that nepotism is illegal in the public administration. , Bolsonaro and his wife lived in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro.

The Pathology Transformation Project The Pathology Transformation Project was initiated by the Strategic Projects Team in an attempt to provide impetus to the Anglian region‚Äôs NHS Trusts to transform and consolidate their pathology services in order to realise the required 20% cost savings. The region's NHS Trusts were required to form their own pathology Joint venture arrangements and then to participate in a formal procurement process to tender their services to the region's NHS primary care trusts via a Call for bids. The philosophy was that joint venture arrangements could achieve greater cost savings for the Primary Care Trusts via greater economies of scale. The Strategic Projects Team employed KPMG to facilitate the process. The Pathology Partnership, whose name was the \\"Transforming Pathology Partnership\\" (TPP) at that time, employed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) to facilitate their bid. Following the procurement process, the (Transforming) Pathology Partnership won most of its primary care trusts' geographical region for the provision of general practice pathology results. Transformation and reorganisation Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was the Host Trust for the Partnership. All of the region's pathology laboratory staff, who were originally employed by the Partner Trusts, were required to re-apply for their current positions in the new organisation; the design of the pathology laboratories' staffing structures had been streamlined as part of the intent to realise cost savings. Those staff members who were successful in their applications underwent contractual transfer from their existing NHS Trust employing organisations to Cambridge University Hospitals, under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE). During that contractual transfer period, many existing laboratory staff were made redundant as a stated necessary means of achieving the required cost savings; many other laboratory staff left the organisation. Organisational structure Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust were the two hubs for pathology in the region. East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust and West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust retained host satellite laboratories with the intention to perform only urgent work. The six Partner Trusts were both owners and customers under the joint venture arrangement. The Pathology Partnership's head office was based off-site, separate from the Partner Trusts' sites, at the Iconix Business Park in Pampisford. The Pathology Partnership's Executive Board and managerial structure were an autonomous entity but were accountable to the Executive Boards of the Partner Trusts. Financial decline In April 2015, it emerged that the Pathology Partnership was forecasting a ¬£4.5m deficit for 2014-15 on budgeted income of ¬£67.8m. Cambridge University Hospitals, which employed the Partnership‚Äôs 800 laboratory staff as the Partnership's Host Trust, announced its intention to withdraw in July 2016 after it incurred a ¬£15 million deficit in 2015-16. During its 3 year period of existence the Pathology Partnership experienced a high turnover of senior staff, comprising 3 Chief Executive Officers and 4 Chief Operating Officers (Operations Directors). Demise and legacy The Pathology Partnership formally dissolved at the end of April 2017 with an initial stated debt of ¬£25 million; ¬£20 million of that initial debt was attributable to non-payment of costs to Public Health England, who were subcontracted by the Partnership to deliver the region's Microbiology service. Following the dissolution of the Pathology Partnership, it has been calculated that its total outstanding debt at its time of dissolution was at least ¬£70 million.

The vessel was launched as Barrenjoey, a steamer and one of the six \\"Binngarra\\" type Manly ferries which were built between 1905 and 1922. In 1951, she was converted to diesel-electric power, completely rebuilt and renamed North Head. She was removed from service in 1985 following the introduction of the Freshwater class ferries. She spent time in Hobart as a floating restaurant, and in 2000, she was taken to Cairns where she remains grounded and in deteriorating condition. The name \\"Barrenjoey\\" was taken from the headland at the northern tip of Pittwater. \\"North Head\\" is the northern headland at the entrance to Sydney Harbour. Background Kuring-gai (1901) was the forerunner to the \\"Bingarra-type\\" vessels including Barrenjoey. Note the wheel houses located midships compared to Barrenjoeys at the ends of the sun deck. The Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company's fleet transitioned comparatively late to screw propelled vessels and the fleet comprised mostly paddle steamers until the early years of the twentieth century. The difficulty of turning in the narrow bays of Sydney Harbour - particularly in the busy Circular Quay terminus in Sydney Cove - required the use of double-ended vessels. However, a double-ended screw configuration was particularly difficult for the fine bows that Manly ferries required for both speed and heavy seas. Further, a propeller at the leading forward end of a vessel reduced speed considerably. In the prosperous early twentieth century, this speed drawback was overcome by increasing engine size and power. The first screw ferries on the Manly run were two innovative Walter Reeks‚Äìdesigned vessels; the SS Manly (1896), and SS Kuring-gai (1901), which were to become the fore-runners of the \\"Binngarra-class\\" ferries. They both had high forecastles at either to help her run through the deep-sea conditions across the Sydney Heads. The steel-hulled Kuring-gai was larger and she further refined the basic design to be similar to the subsequent and larger \\"Binngarra-class\\" vessels. Manly and Kuring-gai had both, however, followed paddle steamer design with their bridges around the midships funnels. Whereas the \\"Binngarra-class\\" vessels would have their wheelhouses at either end of their promenade decks. The \\"Binngarra-class\\" ferries, Binngarra (1905), Burra- Bra (1908), Bellubera (1910), Balgowlah (1912), Barrenjoey (1913), and Baragoola (1922), were designed by Mort's Dock and Engineering, initially under the guidance of former chief draughtsman Andrew Christie. The first five were built at Mort's Woolwich yard and Baragoola was built at the Balmain yard. They were among the largest ships built in Australian yards at the time and, on the admission of Mort's executives, were built by the dock more for prestige than profit. Build costs were higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom, but this was offset by the cost of sailing them out to Australia. Steam ship Barrenjoey Barrenjoey on Sydney Harbour, 1920s, before expansion of her wheelhouses Following Belluberas success (she was bigger and faster than the preceding Binngarra and Burra-Bra), in 1911 the Company placed an order for two new vessels, Balgowlah and Barrenjoey, which were largely the same design. The three would represent the largest, fastest, and most refined of the six \\"Binngarra-class\\" vessels. Like the previous four of the class, Barrenjoey was built by Mort's Dock at their Woolwich yard. The three vessels all had riveted steel hulls with single screws at either end, and steam steering equipment. Barrenjoey was 500 tons, 64.0 m in length and had a passenger capacity of 1,512. Her 112-horsepower triple expansion steam engines were also built by Mort's Dock could push her at up to 15 knots. The vessels had \\"navy-type\\" boilers with corrugated furnaces in both. The ships' promenade (upper) decks were entirely open except for two small shelters and the canopy formed by the sun deck. All of the \\"Binngarra-class\\" would later have their upper decks enclosed except the first two, Binngarra and Burra Bra. The main (lower) decks were enclosed and had outside perimeter seating. The two decks were connected by two double internal staircases. The ladies' cabin was located at the aft end of the main deck, while the crew spaces were placed on a flat forward of the boiler room. Electric lighting was fitted throughout. Approaching Circular Quay in her recently enclosed upper decks, 1931. Barrenjoey was launched on 8 May 1913 by the daughter of Mr. B. McBride (a director of the Port Jackson Company). The name \\"Barrenjoey\\" was taken from the headland at the northern tip of Pittwater. Her sea trials were run on 17 September 1913 from near Long Nose Point to the Sow and Pigs and back. A newspaper report said that she exceeded the speed stipulated in the contract by one knot. Following the trials, guests of the company were entertained at a luncheon held on board with her moored off Cremorne Point. The chairman noted that since the paddle steamer Narrabeen (1886), the combined value of new steamers delivered by Mort's Dock for the company was ¬£170,000. In 1901, the fleet comprised five steamers with a combined capacity of 4,300 passengers. Twelve years later with Barrenjoeys introduction, there were eight vessels with a combined capacity of 10,500. The new steamer was placed in service on 20 September 1913, at which time the company's capacity was sufficient and Baragoola wasn't delivered until 1922. The cost and difficulty of replacing the large steel-hulled Manly ferries saw them upgraded and modified rather than replaced. In line with regulations requiring improved crew accommodation, facilities were progressively removed from the poorly-ventilated spaces below the main deck. In the 1920s, Barrenjoey along with Bellubera, Balgowlah and Baragoola had officers' cabins attached to their wheelhouses. In the 1940s additional cabins were added to the wheelhouses for the entire crews, which affected the vessels' stability and resulted in reduced passenger capacities from the 1950s. Also in the 1920s, Barrenjoey and the rest of the \\"Binngarra- class\\" ferries were fitted with small cafeterias below the main deck aft, but the cafeteria's were removed from the vessels in the 1930s. In August 1930, Barrenjoey had much of her open upper deck enclosed with reversible and upholstered seating provided making the vessels more suitable for the heavy business traffic, and was of benefit to the travelling public during the colder months and at night.SS Barrenjoey/MV North Head Ferries of SydneyManly Ferries Balgowlah, Barrenjoey & Baragoola History Works December 2007 Balgowlah, Bellubera, and Baragoola also received enclosed upper decks between 1931 and 1932, however, the older Binngarra and Burra-Bra did not receive the upgrade. Curl Curl and Dee Why (both 1928) had been built with the enclosed upper saloon. Motor vessel North Head Newly rebuilt as North Head and alongside thumb In 1946, the company decided to convert Balgowlah and Barrenjoey from steam to diesel-electric propulsion, as the cost of replacing the two vessels with new boats was by then prohibitive to the company. Barrenjoeys last trip as a steamer was on 12 April 1948, when she was withdrawn from service for a survey, which subsequently failed her boilers. By 30 June 1949, the ferry's original builder, Mort's Dock and Engineering, had fitted new hull plates, altered the hull framing, and provided foundation beds for the new equipment. Post-war shortages of labour and materials prolonged the work and increased costs to ¬£261,772 which almost bankrupted the company. Four seven-cylinder British Thomson-Houston diesel engines were provided which drove two English Electric electric engines. Her new engines generated 2000 bhp and could push her to 16 knots. Her tall single steam funnel was replaced with two short funnels. Her formerly timber superstructure was completely rebuilt with a fully enclosed steel upper deck, wheelhouses further extended, and bows rebuilt to resemble the South Steyne's (1938). With the exception of the outside seating on the main deck, all seating was enclosed and upholstered. The camber on the upper deck was removed, and with the transverse seating being removable, it was possible to hold dances on board while limited catering facilities were provided. The vessel's new gross and net tonnages was 465.66 and 183.78 respectively. She was permitted to carry 904 on the main deck and 358 persons on the promenade deck with a total seated capacity of 1,005. The rebuild also provided a raked bow and stern in place of the former straight stems. Following sea trials on the 5 May 1951, she was commissioned on 7 May 1951 having been renamed North Head. The vessel's stability had been affected by the new heavier steel superstructure and larger wheelhouses. Life rafts were moved from the sun deck to the fore and aft ends of the promenade deck and sections of the bulwarks were hinged to allow the wooden rafts to be pushed overboard. North Head at thumb The last four \\"Binngarra-class\\" ferries (Balgowlah, Bellubera, Barrenjoey and Baragoola) were all to be modernised and converted to diesel-electric propulsion. However, the company's post-war economic difficulties and the cost of the Barrenjoeys rebuild and diesel conversion almost bankrupted the company. As such, Balgowlah was decommissioned and sold to ship breakers in 1953 and the engines acquired for her went to Baragoola. Upgrades to Bellubera and Baragoola in future years were much more modest in scope retaining their original hull shape and timber superstructures. Bellubera was withdrawn from service in 1973. In 1964, it was sent to Melbourne under her own power for the Moomba Festival for six weeks. It returned to Melbourne in 1965 and 1967. North Head and Baragoola were included in the sale of the Manly ferry business to Brambles in April 1972 (South Steyne was not). With Brambles having allowed the ferries condition and service to deteriorate while suggesting that the service would be closed completely, the Public Transport Commission took over the service in December 1974 acquiring North Head and Baragoola. With the arrive of the first two Freshwater class ferries in 1982 and 1983, Baragoola was retired. In 1984, a third new ferry, Narrabeen arrived and with the new ferries having settled down, North Head was withdrawn on 12 December 1985, 72 years after entering service. On 26 March 1987, North Head departed under its own steam for Hobart for use as a floating restaurant and convention centre. She underwent significant restoration, however, the venture failed. In 2000, it was sold and moved to Cairns to be used in the same manner. However, after the venture failed, the ship rotted in a Cairns dock until 2005, when it was sold on eBay to a landscape contractor, who dug a pit and put it in his front yard. Incidents Over her 73 years as a Sydney Harbour ferry, Barrenjoey/North Head had her fair share of largely minor collisions and other incidents: * Within a year of her commissioning, Barrenjoey was lost in thick fog and drifted around Manly Cove for two and half hours before finding the wharf around 1:30 a.m. * Barrenjoey collided with Kareela in 1914, Kiandra in 1927. Collisions with the timber inner harbour ferries usually resulted in significant damage to the timber boats, but insignificant damage to the steel Manly ferries. * In January 1940, she collided with Kubu as both ferries tried to avoid yachts. Timber Kubus upper deck and railings were badly damaged, whereas steel-hulled Barrenjoey was only scratched. * In January 1942, Barrenjoey went aground on rocks at Smedleys Point near Manly wharf. She was stuck for an hour before freeing herself and continuing on with her normal trip with no damage. * During a cyclone that hit Sydney on 16 April 1946, passengers on Barrenjoey and Baragoola were injured and both ferries damaged. Later that day in the same storm, Barrenjoey was torn free of her mooring at the Kurraba Point base and drifted across the harbour towards a group of navy ships, but then jammed crosswise into the Neutral Bay ferry wharf. A tug was used to pull her free. * On the night 28 May 1955, North Head ran aground off Bradleys Head in thick fog. It was two and a half hours before she was pulled off, by which time the fog was so thick, all harbour traffic had been halted. * In 1976, a fire broke out in North Heads wiring. It was put out and she returned to the Balmain base where it was replaced and she went back into service the next day. * In 1979, North Head failed to stop at Circular Quay and rammed the seawall and footpath. Damage was found to be slight, however, with only Baragoola and the small Lady Wakehurst available, peak hour was chaos. * In July 1979, she lost a rudder near Bradleys Head which caused chaos on the morning run for the 31st. With only one rudder until a new one could be made, she was used sparingly in peak hour. Baragoola and the smaller Lady Wakehurst had to carry the majority of the service as the small Lady Nortcott was not available due to a refit. * On 5 November 1984, during a Sydney record rain event, North Head and Kanangra collided off the Sydney Opera House. North Head had turned too early and the collision with Kanangra prevented her running into the Sydney Opera House. The smaller Kanangra had significant damage but there was no apparent significant damage to North Head. Two weeks later, however, she broke down and was found to have a broken propellor shaft, likely damaged in the accident with Kanangra.

He is the youngest national spokesperson for AAP and among the youngest spokesperson across parties. He is currently the Vice Chairman of the Delhi Jal Board and the MLA from the Rajendra Nagar assembly constituency in Delhi. Branded as a benchmark for the new age politicians in India, Chadha has chartered a robust political career graph by undertaking crucial roles for the party. He has served as a member of the Political Affairs committee, National Executive committee (highest decision making body of the party)and National Treasurer for AAP. He has also been tasked with the role of litigation in-charge for the party and the face of the party in all Prime TV Shows. He was signed on as an advisor to Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia to assist him in the preparation for 2016 budget at an honorarium remuneration of Re.1 per month. He worked in the capacity of a financial advisor. His appointment was retroactively terminated by Union Minister of Home Affairs in April, 2018. He was unanimously voted into the party's National Executive Committee. He was appointed as the incharge for South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency for the general elections in 2019. Post 2020 elections, Mr.Chadha was given the post of Vice Chairman of the Delhi Jal Board.  Early life and career  Born on 11 November 1988 and raised in New Delhi, Chadha received his school education from the capital city‚Äôs Modern School, Barakhamba Road and graduated University of Delhi (DU). He then persued Chartered Accountancy from the Institute of Chartered Accounts of India, post which he moved to London to enroll in the ‚ÄòLondon School of Economics‚Äô. In his early he worked with leading accountancy firms including Deloitte and Grand Thornton. He was setting up a boutique wealth management company in England (London) & in India (Delhi) when the ‚ÄòIndia Against Corruption‚Äô (IAC) movement began to take its course in India. He found his calling and came to join the Anna movement. Towards the fag end of the India Against Corruption movement, Arvind Kejriwal- the present Chief Minister of Delhi, who was planning to form the Aam Aadmi Party, tasked Raghav to draft the Lokpal Bill for the NCT of Delh. Resonating with idea of ‚Äòclean and affordable politics and volunteerism‚Äô driven by the ethics of anti-corruption, Chadha decided to put his career as a Chartered Accountant on the back burner and join Arvind in his endeavour to bring about political change. The AAP party was formed and Raghav's journey in AAP started with working with teams from the grassroots, field experts and academics to compile their findings and draft what became AAP's manifesto for Delhi elections. From joining the IAC movement in 2011 at the age of 23, Raghav has grown with the party. Even in the most iconic and traditional political parties and families, it is a rarity to find a young man with an impeccable education who shuns a promising future and worldly allure to dedicate his life to serve his country through political change. Even more so, it is rare for a young man or woman to do so without any political godfather or intention of entering electoral politics. In a refreshing change, newspapers and newsrooms were discussing policies and governance instead of people and scandals, as the election was being fought on the plank of development and not on identity politics. At the forefront of these discussions was the young Raghav, who was pushed into the media limelight as the party's calm, composed voice of reason in panels of seasoned politicians. Not only did he stand his ground he has since become a familiar face in media navigating the party through every success and controversy. When AAP won the 2015 Delhi Legislative Assembly Election with a thumping majority, Chadha at the age of 26 was appointed as AAP‚Äôs national treasurer, a position of great responsibility in a party that prides itself in transparency and accountability of every single penny received from every generous donor. In 2017, when AAP was embroiled in a web of myriad cases, Raghav was assigned to work with the legal team. Be it small fabricated cases against leaders, MLAs, Party or massive indictments that threatened to destabilize the government; Raghav was the forefront leading a cohesive defense which ultimately resulted to all 22 cases against AAP legislators to being declared nullified. He was furthermore also appointed as the advisor to the Deputy Chief Minister, to assist in the finance portfolio. He assisted Manish Sisodia in the preparation of the 2016-2017 budget at an honorarium of Rs. 1 per month. In April 2018, the then Union Minister of Home Affairs, Rajnath Singh, terminated his appointment as an advisor to Sisodia along with 9 other advisors. Chadha created a stir when he wrote a letter to the ministry, addressing his appointment date to the tenure he had served; returning the amount of Rs. 2.5/- which he had received as remuneration for his service as an advisor to Delhi Government. Raghav Chadha gradually established himself as AAP's crisis man, the trusty youngster at the centre of every crisis and an important member that drove AAP towards victory for every political turbulence faced. Raghav became the youngest spokesperson to be appointed for a political party and gradually took on multiple roles for the party. From becoming the voice and face of crisis management for the party to spearheading inter party coordination and lassoing to becoming the face of the party in prime TV Shows. He also attended the canonization of Mother Teresa by Pope Francis at St. Peter‚Äôs Bascilica in Vatican City on 4th September 2016, along with the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. He has been representing the party at various international conferences and events, including the Euporean Union and International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. In 2018, he contested from the South Delhi Parliamentary constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He lost in the elections to the BJP candidate, Ramesh Bidhuri. In February 2020, he contested from the Rajendra Nagar constituency in 2020 Delhi Assembly and won against BJP‚Äôs candidate RP Singh by more than 20,000 votes. Following the elections he was appointed as vice-chairman of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and assigned the water portfolio in the Delhi Government. The same year, he also did a shoot for a Netflix drama. Personal Life Being born and brought up in Delhi, Raghav was well settled in his journey of being one of the youngest CA‚Äôs when he found his calling to service the nation through political change. His journey from being the Modern school boy to AAP spokesperson has been a tale of inspiration for the youth of India to kindle their desire to join politics to make a difference in the nation. His dynamic personality is reflected in the diversified range of awards and accolades he has under his belt. From being awarded as the most recognized young political brand, to being the most stylish to being the 50 most influential young Indians, Raghav has built a niche space for himself in the public opinion. Raghav‚Äôs political career as a charismatic leader has been cherished by some of the leading authors, who have mentioned about him in their books The Young and the Restless: Youth and Politics in India authored by Gurmehar Kaur describes the journey of some young leaders, including Raghav Chadha. A veteran journalist Ms. Saba Naqvi in her book titled, ‚ÄòThe Power of 26 year olds‚Äô talks about the secrets of AAP‚Äôs success is the power given to young volunteers like Chadha. Being seen fighting debates opposite seasoned politician on news channels have put him in the spotlight given the stark change in visuals in political representation in India which is usually from the age bracket of 50-70. This spotlight has created a massive female fan base for Chadha, who is unmarried at the moment and is considered as one of the most eligible bachelors of the country. Apart from politics, Chadha is a cricket buff and enjoys playing cricket whenever he has the time. He also enjoys playing badminton and has been a state level badminton player.

His work is instantly identifiable for the bold use of stylised Art Deco forms, breath-taking attention to detail and ingenious composition. Dunlop joined the London Scottish Regiment as a private in 1914. After the war, he became a clerk on a cargo ship sailing between London and Vladivostok. He studied at St. Martins and Central School of Arts and Crafts before going on to become an assistant in the studio of Alfred Gilbert, the sculptor of Eros in Piccadilly Circus. In 1932, he married acclaimed modernist artist, Aletta May Lewis. He exhibited in the summer exhibition at the Royal Academy on three occasions: Ant (1930); Pegasus (1933); Head of Harold Lewis (1948). On many occasions, Dunlop worked with architectural giants, Whinney Son & Austen Hall, with his works forming the centre-piece of their designs. Much of his work was part of the regeneration of London after the war. The survival and location of much of his work are unknown.  Known works  * RMS Queen Elizabeth (Cunard, 1938): panels depicting hunting, shooting, and fishing. Whilst undergoing refurbishment works in Hong Kong harbour in 1972, the liner caught fire and capsized. Fire- damaged and now partially dismantled, the vessel's remains lie on the sea-bed of the harbour; *Lambeth Town Hall, London (Whinney Son & Austen Hall, 1935‚Äì8): statue 'Youth rising from the Past', added as part of extension and redevelopment works in the 1930s; * Former London Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS) School of Transport, Derby (William Henry Hamlyn, 1937‚Äì8): eight square bas-relief panels carved in Portland stone and set between each window on the majestic facade. Each panel represents different activities of the LMS: locomotive building, rolling stock construction, signals, and telegraphs, civil engineering, architecture, research, marine transport and traffic operations; *RIBA Headquarters, 66 Portland Place, London (George G. Wornum, 1932‚Äì4): Dominion screen to the Florence Hall carved in Quebec pine. There are a total of twenty square panels depicting scenes from the Commonwealth countries; * Former gas company showroom, George Street, Luton (Whinney Son & Austen Hall, 1936): figure with Flambeau; * Midland Bank, Camden Town, London (1930s): pair of curved bas-relief panels with central herald's staff or caduceus. Through the association of this staff carried by Hermes in Greek mythology, the caduceus symbolizes commerce and negotiation. These staffs are surrounded by plans, cheques, and scales; *Fishmonger's Hall, London (restored Whinney Son & Austen Hall, 1951): it is known that Dunlop designed panels for this building as part of Whinney Son & Austen Hall's restoration works following damage during WWII. Though it is understood that his work survives, it has not yet been formally identified and attributed; * The Institute of Bankers, originally 10 Lombard Street (Whinney Son & Austen Hall, 1938‚Äì40): twelve window reveals depicting the history of trade and banking. The buildings on the site of 10-15 Lombard Street were demolished in the early 2000s. It is unknown if any of Dunlop's work was salvaged; * Pegasus House or New Filton House, Filton, Bristol (Whinney Son & Austen Hall): former headquarters of Bristol Aeroplane Company, now Airbus offices. Dunlop's works include a statue of Pegasus and a 'Britain First' panel to the east elevation, and a figure of Mercury to the west elevation. For the entrance foyer, Dunlop designed a spectacular inlay floor of marble, silver, and brass depicting the signs of the zodiac. (The connection between these astrological symbols and flight may not be immediately apparent; the Zodiac was the name given to the Bristol Aeroplane Company's first aircraft, which never made it off the ground). Perhaps Dunlop's best known surviving sculptures are in the window reveals to the projection room at Pegasus House. These ten elegant plaster panels chart the histories of natural and powered flight and are composed of winged insects, dandelion clocks, flying fish, birds, Icarus, spinning planets, parachutes, zeppelins, bi-planes, etc. Pegasus House, since 1999 a Grade II listed building, was abandoned and left to fall prey to dereliction and vandalism for over twenty years, before undergoing extensive renovation works in 2013. In December 2014, a striking plaster panel depicting muscled men and signed D.C. Dunlop (Denis Cheyne Dunlop) appeared on BBC's Antiques Roadshow. The owner of the panel was unaware of its provenance and the antiques expert was unfamiliar with the sculptor. Much intrigue surrounded this handsome panel, leading to a spin-off episode of Antiques Roadshow Detectives. The origins of the panel remain unknown.

For General Electric he designed, with his colleague Charles Propster, the GE-225 in 1959. He cited the first computer-controlled \\"point of sale\\" cash register as his greatest contribution. He was the father of film director Steven Spielberg. Early life and career Arnold Spielberg was born in Cincinnati on February 6, 1917. He was of Jewish descent. His mother, Rebecca (n√©e Chechick), was born in Sudylkiv, Ukraine; his father, Samuel, was born in Kamianets-Podilskyi, Ukraine.http://birth-records.mooseroots.com/l/1321764/Arnold-Meyer-Spielberg They later immigrated to the United States, meeting and eventually marrying in Cincinnati. From the age of nine, Spielberg began building radios. He scrounged parts from garbage cans to assemble his first crystal receiver. \\"At 15, Arnold became a ham radio operator, building his own transmitter, a skill that proved fortuitous when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in January 1942, one month after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and joined the Signal Corps.\\" After training as a radio-gunner for the Air Corps, his skills in the design of new airplane antennas elevated him to the position of Communications Chief of a B-25 Squadron in India. During the Holocaust, Spielberg lost between 16 and 20 relatives. Spielberg married concert pianist Leah Posner (1920‚Äì2017) in January 1945. After graduating from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, he joined RCA's Advanced Development Department in 1949, where he did early work on servo and guidance systems. In 1960, Spielberg traveled to Moscow as part of a delegation of electrical engineers from Phoenix. The trip coincided with an incident that became the subject of his son's 2015 film Bridge of Spies. Steven Spielberg described the event his father experienced at the time: > The Russians were putting the pilot Gary Powers' helmet and his flight suit > and the remains of the U-2 plane on show for everyone in Russia to see. A > military man saw my father's American passport and took him to the head of > the queue and repeated really angrily to the crowd, \\"look what your country > is doing to us.\\" Work When RCA entered the computer field, Spielberg began doing early circuit designs implementing computer logic. Moving into systems design, he was responsible for the design of a tape-to-tape data sorter. He designed and patented the first electronic library system, implemented as an interrogation system for data stored on an array of magnetic tapes. Promoted to Manager of Advanced Product Development, he was given responsibility for development of a \\"point of sales\\" system. The system involved a central processing computer called Recorder Central with ten satellites, specially designed point-of-sale units. All data were error-checked by feedback data verification. The system had all the capabilities of today's point-of-sale systems, including price lookup on a large drum storage unit, calculating sales transactions including sales tax and discounts, and credit verification. In 1957, Spielberg began working for General Electric. Here he was instrumental in developing the GE-200 series of computers. The GE-225 was derived from the GE-312 and 412 process-control computers. Spielberg and Charles \\"Chuck\\" H. Propster had worked together at RCA on BIZMAC before designing the GE-225, introduced in 1960. Spielberg retired in 1991 but continued consultation work for technology companies. He also worked with the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, formerly Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, an organization founded by his son Steven. Personal life and death Spielberg had four children with his wife Leah: son Steven and daughters Anne, Nancy, and Sue. He also had 14 grandchildren and 20 great- grandchildren. In February 2017, he became a centenarian. Spielberg died from natural causes at his home in Los Angeles, California, on August 25, 2020, at the age of 103.

Described by The Age as an \\"anti-quackery crusader\\", Harvey is an advocate of evidence-based medicine and a critic of pharmaceutical marketing and unproven diet products. He is the President of Friends of Science in Medicine. Career Harvey graduated in medicine from the University of Melbourne. He developed an interest in the factors that influence the prescribing of antibiotics, especially where it involved unethical promotion. He worked at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and then as an adjunct associate professor in the School of Public Health at La Trobe University. Harvey took part in drawing up ethical criteria for the promotion of medicinal drugs for the World Health Organization, and served on a committee that formulated the Australian \\"Quality Use of Medicines\\" policy. He has also worked on medicinal drug policy in Southeast Asia, Croatia, and Jordan. He is Chair of the Governing Council of Health Action International Asia Pacific. He served on the TGA's Transparency Review Panel, the Medicines Australia Code Review Panel, the Working Group on Promotion of Therapeutic Products, and the Natural Therapy Review Advisory Committee. Another of his areas of interest is the application of information technology to optimise medicinal drug use. Harvey quit his job with La Trobe in 2014 after the university agreed to receive $15 million from Swisse Wellness to fund a new complementary medicine centre. He told the Australian Journal of Pharmacy that \\"in 2013-4 Swisse sought a research partnership with a number of Australian universities; all but one resisted on the grounds that, while such an association might give Swisse a fig-leaf of respectability, it would not reflect well on the reputation of the university involved.\\" This followed legal action by Swisse against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for defamation in a consumer advocacy show The Checkout, which criticised their research methods. In 2014 after leaving La Trobe, Harvey took a post as Adjunct Associate Professor of Epidemiology & Preventive Medicine at Monash University. Campaigning Ken Harvey is a critic of drug promotion by pharmaceutical companies, and supports a campaign called \\"No Advertising Please\\" that calls on doctors to reject free lunches from drug company representatives (who selectively present evidence that goes in a new drug's favour), and instead to only prescribe drugs that they have independently researched, including reading critical evaluations. Harvey served as a consumer representative on Medicines Australia's transparency working group, which advocated for patients to be able to know whether their doctors had been given free flights to industry funded conferences that promote new drugs. Harvey has called on the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) \\"to ban inaccurate, misleading or unethical promotion of medicines\\", and is a strong critic of the way that therapeutic claims of complementary medicines are regulated. Harvey has criticised the TGA for not regulating body building products that contain synthetic amphetamines, which are instead regulated as food products despite making health claims. In 2016, he highlighted that Chemmart's consumer DNA testing was misleading and breached the TGA's Advertising Code because it was not able to deliver on the claims being made for it. Friends of Science in Medicine In 2019, Harvey became the President of Friends of Science in Medicine (FSM). He replaced Professor John Dwyer AO, the founding president. FSM, founded in 2011, is an organization which aims \\"to emphasise the importance of having health care in Australia based upon evidence, scientifically sound research and established scientific knowledge.\\" It has grown to become a major critic of unscientific health practices and fraudulent health claims.

FSM campaigns against the unethical promotion of therapeutic goods and services to consumers. Harvey originally joined the organization in 2016 and is a long-time executive member of FSM Nurofen Harvey criticised the Reckitt Benckiser brand Nurofen for marketing identical ibuprofen products in different packages as \\"targeting\\" specific pain, which became the subject of an ACCC investigation. SensaSlim Harvey was sued for alleged defamation by SensaSlim, a company that marketed products claimed to offer weight loss benefits, after he lodged a complaint about their practices with the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The company attempted to delete all correspondence with an Internet marketing company while under investigation by the ACCC. The Federal Court determined that the company had engaged in deceptive conduct. The final result was that the company was fined a total of $3.55 million and was de-listed. Its principal, Peter Foster, was fined $660,000 and permanently banned from being a company director or having any business in the diet or health industry. Two other directors, Peter O'Brien and Michael Boyle were fined $55,000 and $75,000 respectively and disqualified from being company directors. Medical Journal of Australia In 2015, Stephen Leeder was sacked as the Editor-In- Chief of the Medical Journal of Australia after criticizing the decision to outsource production of the journal to the global publishing giant Elsevier. All but one of the AMJ's editorial advisory committee resigned following the decision to sack Leeder, and wrote to AMA president Brian Owler asking him to review the decision. Ken Harvey supported Leeder and said that his sacking, and the use of Elsevier is \\"a mistake that is fairly irredeemable\\" Chiropractic Harvey is very critical of the way that complaints against chiropractors have been handled by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency's (AHPRA) Chiropractic Board of Australia, regarding violations of its registration standards since the board's inception. The violations include \\"advertising in a misleading or deceptive manner,\\" use of testimonials, and encouragement of \\"unnecessary use of health services.\\" After a lack of resolution to these complaints, Harvey and the FSM approached the ACCC since they have \\"powers, under national consumer law, to prosecute for misleading and deceptive and unconscionable conduct\\" in the hopes that action would be taken to resolve the complaints. In 2015, over a year after contacting the ACCC, Harvey and the FSM followed up on \\"ten representative complaints\\" to see if any action had been taken by either government body. Of those complaints, only one clinic resolved all of the issues while the others were still unresolved, including one clinic which had simply set up a new website containing the previous violations. It appeared that AHPRA had contacted the chiropractic clinics regarding the complaints, but they had not done very much to enforce their own rules. In response to this failure, Harvey and his colleagues contacted the press, including the AMJ and The Sydney Morning Herald, bringing a large amount of attention to the issue. Recognition In 2011 he was awarded the Thornett Award for Promotion of Reason by the Australian Skeptics, and in 2013 they made him a life member. The Australian consumer advocacy organisation Choice gave Harvey its \\"Consumer Champion\\" award in 2012, describing him as a \\"scam buster and snake oil nemesis\\", and they made Harvey a life member for his \\"services to the consumer movement\\". In 2016, the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science chair Dr Malcolm Jenkins presented Harvey with their ANZAAS Medal, \\"in recognition of his longstanding advocacy for evidence-based medicine and treatment\\". The same year, he was awarded Skeptic of the Year by the Australian Skeptics \\"for continued and determined efforts which have made a significant impact on exposing malpractice in the chiropractic industry and its governing bodies\\". Harvey was awarded a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia in the 2017 Queen's Birthday Honours list, to recognize his \\"significant service to community health and the pharmaceutical industry through roles in developing guidelines for the ethical use of antibiotics‚Äù.

The first season was 6 episodes broadcast on Wednesday nights at 9:30, starting March 18, 2015. On April 28, 2015 VH1 announced that the show had been renewed for a second six-episode season which premiered on June 29, 2016. Background The show was created by sisters Sara and Erin Foster who stated via a press release that they were influenced by The Larry Sanders Show, Extras and The Comeback and that \\"By design, the show pokes fun at the reality show genre as we play these stereotypical, delusional sisters who find themselves shooting a reality show\\". Erin said, \\"I wanted to sell a show about fame and celebrities and wealth and vanity and Hollywood\\". According to Susan Levison, VH1's Executive Vice President of original programming, the goal of the show was \\"to present a humorous take on reality TV and the rarified world of Hollywood\\". Premise The show follows quasi-famous sisters Sara and Erin Foster around in a reality show format, but it is scripted and they play exaggerated satirical versions of themselves, and get into various predicaments. Celebrity appearances Cameos The show has had brief appearances by Amanda de Cadenet, Ashley Benson, Milla Jovovich, Kate Hudson, Jessica Alba, Rachel Zoe, Courteney Cox, Nicole Richie, Kevin Connolly and Molly Sims as themselves. In addition to return appearances by Jessica Alba and Kate Hudson, in the second season Chris Martin, Chelsea Handler, Zach Braff, Kate Upton, Cindy Crawford, Brooke Burke, Dr. Phil, Ali Larter, Lauren London and Joey Fatone have appearances as themselves. In an interview, Sara Foster said that they'd originally wanted Mindy Kaling to play the part of a TV doctor but after Kaling was not available for filming, they offered Upton the part and it was accepted. Guest roles Comedian Esther Povitsky played a receptionist at an exclusive private school in the 3rd episode titled \\"Favorite Socks\\". In the 6th episode titled \\"Bananas Foster\\", Kay Cannon appeared as a lesbian director version of herself who was considering casting Sara for a part, and Sara falsely says her sister is both single and still a lesbian in order to get Cannon to attend her house party. In the 4th show of the second season \\"Death of a Relationship\\", Jonathan Goldsmith plays a much older love interest of Erin who dies from a heart attack after taking up power lifting. Episodes Season 1 (2015) Season 2 (2016) Reception Amy Amatangelo, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, called the show \\"Part mockumentary, part reality show, part sitcom and entirely hilarious\\" and said the show works because \\"the innately likable siblings are willing to be the brunt of the joke\\". Ellie Shechet, in a review for The Muse ‚Äì Jezebel, said that the show was surprisingly great. While characterizing the show as one that makes you giggle (not laugh) and as relatively funny, she said that she couldn't wait for season 2. David Hinkley, in a review for the New York Daily News, felt that the show was taking on an impossible task ‚Äì trying to create situations that are sillier or more outlandish than what is already on reality shows. And he felt it was \\"not at all hilarious\\" and in the end more likely to make us \\"nod off\\". Allison Keene, in a review for Collider gave the Pilot a \\"3-star Good\\" rating (Proceed with cautious optimism). She said the show was \\"fun, and while it has a clear sense of the scene it's deconstructing with perceptive humor, it's never mean\\".

The first 22 songs (Book 1) were composed between September 1890 and December 1891, and published in 1892. The other 24 songs (Book 2) were composed between March and August 1896, and published the same year. The time lag between the two volumes was caused by Wolf's long-proposed opera, Der Corregidor (1895), which might have been inspired by his personal love triangle with his friend‚Äôs wife Melanie K√∂chert. The 46 lyrics of the songs were taken from an anthology of Italian poems by Paul Heyse (18301914), translated into German and published with the title of Italienisches Liederbuch in 1860. Despite Heyse‚Äôs diverse poetic selections, Wolf preferred the rispetto, a short Italian verse usually consisting of eight lines of ten or eleven syllables each, as a result of which the songs are short.  Description  It is usually performed by alternating baritone and soprano singers, as directed in the recording of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (baritone), Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (soprano), and Gerald Moore (accompanist). In the lyrics, the male in love tends to idealize his lover and praise her beauty, while the female shows practical ideas about love and sometimes has complaints against her lover.

It has na area of 822.92 ha and on December 31, 2012 it had 1,909 inhabitants. The origin of the name has three possible explanations. The first is that it is derived from the word b√≥r (Polish: a conifer forest). The second connects it with the word bor, in Old Polish denoting fighting. The third theory explains the name as derived from the personal name Borys≈Çaw.H. Bia≈Çecka, 2001, p. 5  History  The village was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Borina debent esse triginta novem mansi. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Racib√≥rz, within feudally fragmented Poland. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Silesian Wars it became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1354 Nicholas II, Duke of Opava bestowed the village on a nobleman Stefan from Raszczyce. In the accompanying document the village had a second German name, Woigtsdorf (see Voigt, Polish: w√≥jt), which later disappeared. The descendants of Stefan from Raszczyce borrowed later their surname from the village, Bory≈Ñscy. Parts of the village were in the following centuries in numerous possessions. In years 1572-1593 the village had five concurrent owners.H. Bia≈Çecka, 2001, p. 6 This led to a development of many distinct parts and hamlets of the village, like Borynia Dolna (lower), Borynia ≈örednia (middle), Borynia G√≥rna (upper). A local palace, which survived to modern times, was built by one of Schlutterbach family, who owned the village in the 18th century.H. Bia≈Çecka, 2001, p. 8 The village was few times devastated by wars, especially in the 17th century, when in 1679 only one survivor was reported to live in the village.H. Bia≈Çecka, 2001, p. 9-10 In the 1770s to 1790s in the course of the Frederician colonization a colony (a settlement) called Rudolfsort was established on the fields of Borynia Dolna. It is not certain after whom was the colony named. The first settlers had mostly Polish- sounding names (Wi≈õniowski, Niemiec, Waliczek, Wiaterek, Po≈õpiechowa etc.).H. Bia≈Çecka, 2001, p. 10-11 The colony formed an independent municipality until 1894, when it was absorbed back by Borynia.H. Bia≈Çecka, 2001, p. 11 Another small colony was founded after parcellation of land in 1905. In that time the village was already largely affected by on-going industrial development in the vicinity and many of inhabitants worked in nearby coal mines. There were plans to open a local coal mine before World War II, but Borynia Coal Mine, located actually in Szeroka but named after Borynia, was eventually opened in 1971, when Szeroka, Borynia and Skrzeczkowice formed one municipality with a seat in Borynia. After World War I in the Upper Silesia plebiscite 622 out of 644 inhabitants of Borynia voted in favour of joining Poland, against 22 for Germany.H. Bia≈Çecka, 2001, p. 28 It became later a part of Silesian Voivodeship, Second Polish Republic. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland. In 1954 it became a seat of a municipality where two other villages belonged: Szeroka and Skrzeczkowice. In 1973 the seat of the municipality, hence known as gmina, was moved to Szeroka. It was, however, in 1975 absorbed by Jastrzƒôbie-Zdr√≥j.H. Bia≈Çecka, 2001, p. 37 In a local referendum held in 2000 the inhabitants of Borynia, Szeroka and Skrzeczkowice voted in favour of remaining within the city.

It was a clash between members of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) and anti-fascist demonstrators, including local communists and supporters of the Labour Party. The march was an early attempt by the BUF to rally support in depressed areas, but the anti-fascists protested and drove out the BUF supporters who had been shipped in from other areas. Background Stockton had been hit hard by the economic recession following the Great Depression. The BUF had made previous attempts to hold meetings in Stockton, but they were frequently heckled or attacked by anti- fascists. It was therefore decided by the BUF to make a show of strength. One reason given as to why Stockton was chosen for the rally was to base the growth of the movement on that of the Nazi Party, which rose from a grassroots movement in small towns that suffered economic hardship. Stockton was a small town, and at the time opposition was weak as there was only one Labour Party MP in Teesside at the time. The plan for the rally, however, had been leaked to local trade unions. Although no-one seems to know for certain how the plan was leaked, historian Richard Griffiths has suggested that the leader of the BUF rally, Captain Vincent Collier, was actually a plant working for the Jewish Board of Deputies and possibly also working for MI5.Serdiville, 2018. p. 8 With neither the Labour or Conservative Parties offering solutions to the problem, locals turned to more radical organisations, with members of the Communist Party of Great Britain, the Independent Labour Party and the National Unemployed Workers' Movement thus decided to set up a \\"reception committee\\" ready for the arrival.Serdiville, 2018. p. 6 Events The BUF arrived via a convoy of coaches during the afternoon of 10 September 1933, bringing in 200-300 members from Tyneside, Manchester and Lancashire. They parked on the southern side of the River Tees, on the Thornaby-on-Tees side of Victoria Bridge. They then went to Stockton High Street, to the Market Cross area and attempted to hold a rally led by Collier. However, they were approached by up to 2,000-3,000 anti-fascist protesters who had hidden themselves in the side streets around the High Street, who then began heckling and spitting at Collier. Although there was little police presence at the start, with just seven constables on duty across the whole town centre, the police later ordered the BUF to leave the High Street, so they went to Silver Street to protect themselves, but this ended up trapping them. Both sides then armed themselves with staves, sticks and pickaxe handles. The anti-fascists also used various missiles including stones, half-bricks, knuckledusters and potatoes with razor blades inserted into them.Serdiville, 2018. p. 7 More police officers arrived to separate the two groups and to escort the BUF back to their coaches, with some BUF members marshalling in Silver Street, a narrow lane linking the High Street to the quayside. However, some BUF stragglers had to out-run the anti-fascists, while other BUF members broke ranks and attacked the hostile crowd. Reports claim that up to 20 members of the BUF were injured. Amongst them was Edmund \\"Ned\\" Warburton, brother of John Warburton,\\"John Warburton Fleet Street photographer who acted as a bouncer for the British Union of Fascists\\", The Daily Telegraph, 2 September 2004, p. 29. of Bury, who was hospitalised and later blinded in one eye due to a stone being thrown at him. No arrests were made by the police on the day. Reaction to the event different between the police and press reporting of the battle with: \\"The police were naturally keen to demonstrate that they competently and successfully handled a difficult situation, while the press were keen to sell papers and sensationalise the events. While the reality may lie somewhere in the middle of these accounts, local contemporary accounts of the ‚ÄòBattle of Stockton‚Äô ardently subscribe to the more violent version in order to demonstrate the local residents‚Äô rejection of fascism and the event itself is remembered as a precursor to the more famous Battle of Cable Street.\\" Commemoration In August 2017, an organisation called The Battle of Stockton Campaign (BoS) was founded in order to commemorate the battle, the founding members were Stockton Labour Cllr Paul Weston, Katie Weston, Sharon Bailey and Tom Biggs,to make it as well-known as the better-known Battle of Cable Street, a similar event that took place in London three years later. On 9 September 2018, a plaque marking the battle was unveiled at Market Cross by the town's mayor, Eileen Johnson. Other speakers at the commemoration were Stockton North MP Alex Cunningham, North-East MEP Jude Kirton-Darling, actress and President of the International Brigade Memorial Trust, Marlene Sidaway, convener of Cable Street 80 David Rosenberg and Unison's Claire Williams.

University of Tartu Folk Art Ensemble ( or T√ú RKA) is a University of Tartu folk dance group. It was founded in 1945 and as of 2015 there were around 150 dancers, that makes it one of the oldest and biggest folk dance groups in Estonia.  History  Ilmar Reidla brought together different faculty groups in Tartu State University (TR√ú; name of Tartu University during occupation times) and folk dance group with 10‚Äì12 pairs was formed in 1945. Reidla acted as supervisor until 1948 when Ester Prinits took over.Ajalugu Tartu √úlikooli Rahvakunstiansambel In 1951 Estonian Agricultural Academy was formed from three Tartu State University faculties (Veterinary Science, Forestry, Agriculture). Students formed their own group under guidance of forestry student Ilmar Reidla.Folk Dance Ensemble Tarbatu As of spring 1953 only four pairs had remained and they merged with Tartu Teachers Institute group whose leader was Helju Mikkel. Soon new students started to join and in autumn 1954 it was already possible to form three different training groups. Folk orchestra and some singers also merged with the group. Newly formed ensemble was composed of over 40 students and it gave its first concert in 1955. Second half of 1950s turned out to be greatly successful. Number of students in ensemble grew and Helju Mikkel created several new dances. In 1956 TR√ú RKA performed as the representative of Estonian dance in Moscow. Anniversary concert in 1985. 1956 was also the year when the first Gaudeamus festival was held, that brought together university students from all three Baltic countries. It was organised by Richard Ritsing and Helju Mikkel.1956 Eesti rahvatantsu ajaloo kroonika Ensemble celebrated its 20th jubilee in 1965. Ants Siimer and Kaljo Soonets set together a comprehensive overview of the ensembles activities over the years and based on this TR√ú RKA was given an honorable title of meritorious ensemble of Estonian SSR. Mikkel retired in 1978 and Henn Tiivel, who had started dancing in ensemble already in 1966, took the role as the art director. Ensemble kept on giving a lot of performances in Estonia and in abroad. Restoration of the Estonian independence after Soviet occupation meant hard times for the ensemble as it lost its place for training. Opening up of new possibilities reduced the interest for folk dance and the number of students in ensemble started to shrink rapidly. Singers and musicians left as well. For 50th anniversary in 1995 many older dancers returned and an alumni group of folk ensemble formed.Alumni of Folk Ensemble of Tartu University Aveli Asber became the new art director in 2005. In 2000s folk dance has regained its popularity in Estonia. It has specially gained momentum among the younger generation and this has also expanded the ranks of ensemble. When T√ú RKA celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2015 in Vanemuise concert hall it had around 150 dancers. Next to the groups of university students there are also an alumni group and children group that compromises of the children of the alumni group.Karikakrap√§ev Plank Film  Gallery  TR√ú RKA tantsijad 1950ndatel, keskel Helju Mikkel.JPG1950s, Helju Mikkel in center Seppade tants √ºlikoolide festivalil Harkovis 1969.JPGPerforming in Kharkiv in 1969 TR√ú RKA, film Elavad mustrid 1970.JPGFilming Elavad mustrid in 1970 TR√ú RKA 1984 Hobu folk.JPGHobu folk in 1984 T√úRKA Viljandi talvisel tantsupeol.JPGViljandi Winter Dance Festival in 2010 T√ú RKA 2011 rongk√§ik lauluv√§ljakule.jpg11th Youth Song and Dance Celebration in 2011 T√úRKA Vanemuise suures majas -- Kodukotus.JPGConcert on the stage of Vanemuine (2011) T√úRKA Vanemuise suures majas, laster√ºhm esitamas tantsu P√§ikesej√§nkud.JPGChildren group (2011) T√úRKA Vanemuise suures majas, neiduder√ºhm, tants Lina, 2011.JPGWomen's group (2011) T√ú Rahvakunstiansambel SIVO festivalil -- kolme kandi lood.JPGPerforming in Netherlands (2010) T√úRKA Saaremaal -- Polka burlesk.JPGConcert in Kuressaare in 2012 T√ú RKA Gaudeamusel L√§tis.JPGGaudeamus festival in 2014 References External links *Official website University of Tartu Folk dance companies 1945 establishments in Estonia ","title":"University of Tartu Folk Art Ensemble"},{"id":"46604789","text":"Buchhof, known as Gut Buchhof is an area belonging to the city of Munich.

Built in 1845, it is a fairly typical example of a mid-19th century Greek Revival connected farmstead. It is notable as the birthplace in 1899 of Charles H. Best (1899-1978), who is credited as a co- discoverer of insulin and the development of its therapeutic use in the treatment of diabetes. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and significance The Best House is set on the north side of Old County Road in the village of West Pembroke in Down East Maine. The main portion of the house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame block, three bays wide, with a front-facing gable roof and clapboard siding. The entrance, set in the leftmost bay of the southwest-facing front, is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by an entablature. Southeast of the main block, a 1-1/2 story ell has a secondary entrance with a gable-roof dormer above. A second ell connects this wing to a single-story carriage house and a barn. The house is estimated to have been built about 1845. In 1899, it was here that Charles H. Best was born. Best was educated at the University of Toronto, and in 1921 began a fruitful collaboration with Drs. Frederick Banting and J.J.R. Macleod. On January 11, 1922, Best administered the first dose of insulin to a human subject. Although he was did not formally share in the Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded in 1923 to Banting and Macleod, the latter shared his prize money with Best. Best continued his successful research career with the development of several enzyme-based therapies. He died in 1978. His birthplace was purchased in 1959 by the American Diabetes Association, and transferred in 1978 to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which sold it, with preservation restrictions, into private hands.

He was MP for Plympton Erle (1593), Barnstaple (1597) and Aldborough (1601). He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1578 and entered the Inner Temple c.1580 and was called to the bar in 1590. He was Clerk of Assize on the western circuit in 1590.History of Parliament biography He married Dorothy Bampfield (d.1614), daughter of Sir Amyas Bampfylde (1560‚Äì1626), MP, of Poltimore near Exeter and North Molton in North Devon. Edward Hancock committed suicide on 6 September 1603. He left a one-year-old son and heir William II Hancock (1602‚Äì1625). Dorothy survived her husband and received Mount Radford as her dower house, where she lived with her second husband.Pole, p.235 She remarried to the highly influential Sir John Doddridge (1555‚Äì1628), a Justice of the King's Bench, and contemporary of her father, who had purchased as his seat the North Devon estate of Bremridge, near Dorothy's father's seat of North Molton. She was a Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth I and has a sumptuous monument to her memory in the Lady chapel of Exeter Cathedral, next to that of Dodderidge. =William II Hancock (d.1625)= The father of William II Hancock (1602‚Äì1625) committed suicide when William was an infant aged one year. His mother Dorothy Bampfield then remarried, as his 2nd wife, the highly influential Sir John Doddridge (1555‚Äì1628), a Justice of the King's Bench, and contemporary of her father, who had purchased as his seat the estate of Bremridge, near Dorothy's father's seat of North Molton. They had no children. His mother then Lady Dodderidge died in 1617 when William was aged 15 and he appears to have remained in the care of his step-father Dodderidge, who remarried to Anne Culme, the granddaughter of Hugh II Culme (d.1545) of Molland-Champson, a manor adjoining North Molton. Anne thus effectively became William's step-mother. She had previously been married to Gabriel Newman, a member of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in the City of London, to whom she had borne a daughter Judith Newman (1608‚Äì1634), who was 6 years william's junior. The Newman (or Neuman) family later were seated at Baconsthorpe in Norfolk, in the parish church of which are some grave-slabs sculpted with the family's arms.The Church Heraldry of Norfolk At or before her 17th birthday she and the 23-year-old William were married and had two children: *Anne Hancock, who married Rev. George Cary (1611‚Äì1680), of Clovelly, Dean of Exeter and rector of Shobrooke near Crediton. Their son was Sir George Cary (1653-1684/5), MP for Okehampton, whose monument exists in Clovelly Church. *John Hancock (1625‚Äì1661), (see below) son and heir, in the year of whose birth William died, leaving Judith a 17-year-old widow. At the time of her 1st husband's death in 1625 Sir John Dodderidge and his wife Anne Culme were then still living and presumably had some part in the care of the now fatherless infant. Judith soon remarried to Thomas II Ivatt, but died aged 26 having given birth to a son and heir Thomas III Ivatt, who later resided at Shobrooke near Crediton. Thomas II Ivatt was the eldest son of Thomas I Ivatt (d.1629), who had purchased in 1624 for the sum of ¬£3,000 a lease of the profitable office of \\"Searcher of the Port of London\\" the reversion of which he bequeathed in his will to his son Thomas II Ivatt together with the sum of ¬£400 to cover the cost of acquiring a new royal patent.Will of Thomas I Ivatt (d.1529), National Archives, prob/11/155 Philipa, The widow of Thomas I Ivatt, of unknown family, was a lunatic, and her wardship was sold by the king in 1629 to the poet Aurelian Townsend (d.1643)Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1628-9, pp.560,567 They had the following progeny: *Thomas III Ivatt (d.1691) of Shobrooke.Genuki, Devon Wills Project *Judith Ivatt escutcheon the following arms: Argent, on a cross gules five fleurs-de-lis or (Ivatt) impaling Azure, a chevron wavy between three griffons segreant or (Newman) Judith's second husband Thomas II Ivatt erected a monument with a bust in white marble of his wife in Combe Martin church, positioned on the north wall of the north aisle chapel above the vestry door.

Early life and education Yvonne Marjorie Drewry was born in Brentford, Middlesex, to Alfred F. Vere Drewry (1888-1980) and his wife Ada, n√©e Anniss (1883-1965). Her father ran a motor parts shop on Deansgate in Manchester. Her uncle James Sidney Drewry was an engineer and co-founder of Shelvoke and Drewry, one of the UK's largest manufacturers of municipal waste wagons and fire engines. After studying at Southport College of Art, in 1939 Drewry won an Andrew Grant scholarship of ¬£120 a year for three yearsThe Scotsman, 5 May 1939 to train at the Edinburgh College of Art, where she studied under William George Gillies, John Maxwell and book illustrator Joan Hassall.Artists in Britain Since 1945, David Buckman, Art Dictionaries Ltd, 2006 Work Drewry was a prolific artist, working in oil, watercolour, and pen and ink. She was also a notable print-maker and typographer. Her other work included woven textiles and handicrafts. Her work was exhibited regularly in Suffolk galleries, including an annual exhibition at the Denis Taplin Gallery in Woodbridge, Gallery 44 in Aldeburgh, Mall Galleries, Gainsborough's House, Sudbury, Wolsey Art Gallery, Ipswich, and in her own studio, and featured several times in local press articles;East Anglian Daily Times, 8 May 1968 she also exhibited internationally and made sales in France and the US, and is licensed through Bridgeman Images. From 1985 she was part of the 8+1 Suffolk Group, a group of nine artists that could manage and present their own exhibitions. Their first show was at Broughton Gallery, Lanarkshire in August 1985. Her main subjects were landscapes and seascapes celebrating the Suffolk countryside, along with still life pictures of flowers, plants and trees, including those growing in her own garden; she also produced occasional portraits. Her work was mainly figurative, although her later works were much more abstract in character, using vivid colours and broad brushstrokes. She is mentioned in Patrick Trevor-Roper's influential book The World Through Blunted Sight: An inquiry into the influence of defective vision on art and character (1970) as having different colour perception in each eye.The World Through Blunted Sight: An inquiry into the influence of defective vision on art and character, Patrick Trevor-Roper, Thames & Hudson Her works are rarely titled, and whilst the landscapes are clearly recognisable, they are not usually particularly well- known views, although she did paint Snape Maltings and Shingle Street. She was highly commended in the 1994 Laing Art Competition. She generally worked from life and traveled around Suffolk and Norfolk in a Fiat 238 camper van seeking suitable subjects. Watercolour by Yvonne Drewry, 1974 Linocut by Yvonne Drewry, 1976 Oil Working largely on board, her oil paintings used a broad impasto with vivid colours. The earlier work is mainly figurative, but her later works were more impressionistic and dramatic. They were generally signed \\"Yvonne Drewry\\" and the year in oil paint. Watercolour The watercolour paintings were small, many being pen and ink drawings tinted with colour wash. They were generally signed \\"Yvonne Drewry\\" and the year in pen. Prints Her earliest works, including book illustrations, were generally in woodcut, but later she worked mostly in multi-layered linocut, often with as many as eight or nine different colours, generally printing on handmade Japanese paper. Most prints were unsigned, but some contained the initials \\"YD\\" in a cartouche. Books In 1943 Yvonne Drewry illustrated \\"World Under Water, the Adventures of Matthew, Jill and Poco\\", published with Robert Campbell at the Symbole Press, Woodford Green, Essex. The first of four parts was \\"Matthew Explores\\", containing two colour prints by Drewry. From 1944, Drewry created several short run private press illustrated books that she printed herself on an Albion press and bound under the imprint The Black Mill Press, and later The Centaury Press (a reference to her favoured font, Bruce Rogers' Centaur (typeface), a well as the flower). The books were typically in editions of 24, printed on roughly cut handmade paper with slipcases. She illustrated existing work, including Edmund Spenser's Prothalamion, or used Japanese haiku to inspire her own illustrations; she also produced a posthumous edition of the engravings of Viola Paterson, who was the niece of the painter James Paterson and mother of Drewry's friend from her Edinburgh college days, the artist Anne Paterson Wallace. Ephemera Drewry produced her own exhibition catalogues and posters in letterpress, and also created her own Christmas cards, which were usually multi-coloured linocuts, showing the influence of Joan Hassall. She also produced hand woven cloth on a floor loom, and made textile items such as appliqu√© cushions, and produced smaller craft items sold in her annual Sales of Work. Teaching Drewry was an important teacher of art at the Amberfield School in Nacton,Benton End Remembered, Gwynneth Reynolds and Diana Grace (eds), Unicorn Press, 2002 in Felixstowe, and at various local authority run evening classes for adults; she also ran short painting and printing courses in her own home. She was active in various art groups including the Deben (later Felixstowe) Art Group. Her pupils included Maggi Hambling, who cites her as a major childhood influence, and Malta based artist Juliet Horncastle. Personal life In 1941, Drewry married Robert Alexander (Bob) Campbell (1916-2008), whom she met at Edinburgh College of Art. In 1942 they moved to Trimley St Martin in Suffolk, where they had four children. Drewry and Campbell had separated by 1968, when Campbell emigrated to Canada. Although known in her personal life after marriage as Mrs. Campbell, she always painted and exhibited under the name Yvonne Drewry. In 1977 Drewry moved briefly to Tuddenham St Martin, before settling in Hollesley in 1980, where she lived until 2004. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, she spent her last years in a nursing home in Woodbridge, and died in 2007 aged 89.

With the electrostatic force being proportional to r^{-2}, individual particle-particle interactions are long- range in nature, presenting a challenging computational problem in the simulation of particulate systems. To determine the net forces acting on particles, the Ewald or Lekner summation methods are generally employed. One alternative and usually computationally faster technique based on the notion that interactions over large distances (e.g. > 1 nm) are insignificant to the net forces acting in certain systems is the method of spherical truncation. The equations for basic truncation are: displaystyle F_{CUT}(r) = begin{cases} frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{4pivarepsilon_0 r^{2}} & text{for } r le r_c  0 & text{for } r > r_c. end{cases} where r_c is the cutoff distance. Simply applying this cutoff method introduces a discontinuity in the force at r_c that results in particles experiencing sudden impulses when other particles cross the boundary of their respective interaction spheres. In the particular case of electrostatic forces, as the force magnitude is large at the boundary, this unphysical feature can compromise simulation accuracy. A way to correct this problem is to shift the force to zero at r_c, thus removing the discontinuity. This can be accomplished with a variety of functions, but the most simple/computationally efficient approach is to simply subtract the value of the electrostatic force magnitude at the cutoff distance as such: displaystyle F_{SF}(r) = begin{cases} frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{4pivarepsilon_0 r^{2}} - frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{4pivarepsilon_0 r_c^{2}} & text{for } r le r_c  0 & text{for } r > r_c. end{cases} As mentioned before, the shifted force (SF) method is generally suited for systems that do not have net electrostatic interactions that are long-range in nature. This is the case for condensed systems that show electric-field screening effects. Note that anisotropic systems (e.g. interfaces) may not be accurately simulated with the SF method, although an adaption of the SF method for interfaces has been recently suggested. Additionally, note that certain system properties (e.g. energy- dependent observables) will be more greatly influenced by the use of the SF method than others. It is not safe to assume, without reasonable argument, that the SF method can be used to accurately determine a certain property for a given system. If the accuracy of the SF method need be tested, this may be done by testing for convergence (i.e. showing that simulation results do not significantly change with increasing cutoff) or by comparing with results obtained through other electrostatics techniques (such as Ewald) that are known to perform well. As a rough rule of thumb, results obtained with the SF method tend to be sufficiently accurate when the cutoff is at least five times larger than the distance of the near neighbor interactions. With the SF method, a discontinuity is still present in the derivative of the force, and it may be preferable for ionic liquids to further alter the force equation as to remove that discontinuity.

In Fantasy, races are often based on humanoid and/or intelligent creatures from Myths and Folklore. In modern Fantasy and Science fiction, race is a descriptor used to describe the various sapient species and beings that make up the setting. In tabletop role-playing games, players may choose to be one of these creatures when creating their player character (PC) or encounter them as a non-player character (NPC). \\"People\\" is to be taken in the broader sense, and may encompass ethnic groups, species, nationalitye.g. in Savage Worlds Pirates of the Spanish Main or Weird War II or social groups.in Rolemaster Oriental Companion, ‚ÄúCommon man‚Äù and ‚ÄúNoble‚Äù are two distinct human races, although Nobles are said to have some divine or elfic ancestors It can be a fictitious species from a fictional universe, or a real people, especially in case of a history-based universe (even if it has a given level of fantasy), e.g. Call of Cthulhu (1981), Boot Hill (1975) or Bushido (1979). The term ‚Äúrace‚Äù is even broader than the usual meaning, as it also includes extraterrestrial beings; vegetal beings, e.g. the Aldryami in Glorantha (1978), or the Sylvanians in Fantasy Craft (2010); and robots, e.g. Artificials in Fantasy Craft or the Forgeborn/Dwarf-forged optional race in 13th Age (2013). This notion began in fantasy or science-fiction works: novels, comics, video games (especially role-playing video game), board games, LARP, etc. The transmediality is obvious in case of consistent universes, e.g. the Middle Earth or the Star Wars universe. Not all works use the term \\"race\\": in Tunnels and Trolls 7th ed. (2005), Ken St. Andre uses the term \\"kinship\\"; the term ' (species) is used in Das Schwarze Auge, and ' (ethnicity) is used in EW-System 2.0. In the heroic fantasy games, in addition to humans, races or often humanoid and fey creatures of Myth; such as elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, immaterial being (spirits, ghosts), etc. The main influence is the work of J. R. R. Tolkien. Some fantasy or steampunk games also involve \\"artificial creatures\\" (alchemical homunculus, golems and mechanical creatures). In science-fiction games, especially space opera and cyberpunk, the races are humans, extraterrestrials, mutants, cyborgs, transhumans, robots, and artificial intelligences (AI). In some universes, it is possible to have hybrid characters which inherit traits from both parents. For example, in Dungeons & Dragons, it is possible to play a half-elf (hybrid of a human and an elf) or a half-orc (hybrid of a human and an orc).  History  The first role-playing game, ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù Dungeons & Dragons (1974),Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, TSR, Inc., 1974 stems from the wargame Chainmail (1971).Gary Gygax and Jeff Perren, Guidon Game, 1971 Chainmail was especially designed to include fantasy races. The race is therefore a core notion present at the very beginning of the role-playing games. The races in Dungeons & Dragons are strongly inspired by the fantasy literature of the 1930s-1960s.The authors of Dungeons & Dragons give references to Conan the Barbarian (Robert E. Howard, 1932‚Äì1936), the Sword series (Fritz Leiber, 1939‚Äì1988), the Dying Earth series (Jack Vance, 1950‚Äì1984), The Lord of the Rings (J.R.R. Tolkien, 1954‚Äì1955), and the Elric of Melnibon√© series (Michael Moorcock, 1961‚Äì2005) It thus includes the Tolkienian archetypes, but the game makes a difference between: * the races that can be played as player characters, the so-called ‚Äúplayable races‚Äù: humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings (initially called hobbits), half-elves and half-orcs; * ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù, which can only be non-player characters, and which are by name opposed to the player characters: orcs, goblins, kobolds, trolls, ogres, gnolls, etc. In the first science-fiction role-playing game, Metamorphosis Alpha (1976),James M. Ward, TSR, Inc., 1976 it is possible to play humans and mutated creatures. In 1975, Tunnels & Trolls allows for the first time to play ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù, i.e. a player character can be any race, including possibly a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù, but the races are not described in this game; in the 1979 solo adventure Goblin Lake, the player character is a goblin. The 1983 game Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game also allows \\"monsters\\" as PCs (e.g. goblin or a kobold), and these races are described in the same way as the ‚Äúnon-monster‚Äù races. The first fantasy game that breaks with the D&D; conventions is RuneQuest: the ‚Äúelves‚Äù (Aldryami) are vegetal beings, it is possible to play a , but the game also takes into account the cult (pantheon and system of beliefs such as animism) and the cultural background of the character's people: primitive, barbarian, nomadic or civilized. As opposed to Dungeons & Dragons, the character is not totally defined by race and class, but by a list of skills (what the character can do); the cultural background defines the basic value of the skills, and the cult the access to magic. The race is thus less important in a functional point of view (how the character can interact with the fictional world), but more important in a mimetic point of view (roleplay). The ‚Äúbasic bricks‚Äù of the character are more flexible (see below).  Generic races  The ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù Dungeons & Dragons (OD&D;), and the first Advanced Dungeons & Dragons manuals (AD&D;), do not describe any particular universe. The universe is only described through the game rules (magic, gods, fantasy races), and it outlines a generic universe inspired by popular fantasy novels of the 1930s-1960s. The race is essentially a list of capabilities‚Äîfunctional part‚Äîand a rather thin description that is often limited to the visual appearance, with an illustration, and some elements of moeurs‚Äîmimetic part (see below). The way the race takes place in the fictional universe is described in optional books, the ‚Äúcampaign settings‚Äù or ‚Äúworld books‚Äù. The race is thus mainly a ‚Äúfunctional tool‚Äù, a set of functions that the player can implement in the adventure: the elves can see in the dark, and in OD&D; hobbits can only be fighting men. The Player's Handbook also provide a table of ‚ÄúRacial preferences‚Äù and racial restrictions to the alignment, i.e. some races are intended to behave in a given moral way. The player thus has to pick from his own knowledge of other works, particularly in what is now called the ‚Äúgeek culture‚Äù; according to Isabelle P√©rier, PhD in comparative literature:wikidata:Q40895816  Race-driven campaign  In 1989, creates ' (French for ‚Äúhowls‚Äù) in which players characters are ‚Äúerrants‚Äù, ‚Äúwanderers‚Äù, i.e. were-animals that form a caravan. The race of were-animals, and their relationship with the humans, become the main subject of the adventures, and not only a functional element or a flavour to the universe. Other games are then published, where the race of the player characters is itself the main topic of the adventures, especially Vampire: The Masquerade (1991) and Nephilim (1992)  Depiction of real peoples  As aforementioned, some campaign settings are based on real world events, and thus depict real peoples. The way the people are described can be problematic and may sometimes be considered as offending. For example, French articles criticised the way the Soviets were depicted in The Price of Freedom (1986).  Game design  Race selection screen in Falcon's Eye. According to Coralie David,PhD in comparative literature and civilizations at Paris 13 University, see the in role-playing games (as well as in youth literature), the characters are defined by ‚Äúbricks‚Äù; they are in fact ‚Äúsyntagms of fictional paradigms‚Äù (). This makes the immersion of the player (or reader) easier, as anyone can build his own character in a way that is consistent with the fictional universe. Thus, the race is one of these bricks, as it provides a set of predefined parameters (diegetic paradigms) and of characteristics‚Äîin the broad sense: physical characteristics, cultural background, moral values and social relationships. The fictional world is built as a consistent system made of ‚Äúexposed‚Äù bricksthe process is called the ‚Äúsystematization of the fictional world‚Äù () by Coralie David, op. cit. that can be easily identified, and this promotes creativity and sharing; it also promotes the imaginary creation by the player (or reader). The race itself can be made of ‚Äúsub-bricks‚Äù the player can choose, e.g. in After the Bomb 2nd ed. (2001), the player can build his own race by a combination of a basic animal race and mutations.  Function, mimesis and roleplay  As aforementioned, a character is mainly defined by two things: * what he can do in the fictional world, his ‚Äúfunctionalities‚Äù; * who he is as a fictional person: his social status, his look, his habits, his past, etc. which is called here his ‚Äúmimetic part‚Äù The functionalities are often a set capabilities and impairments which the game designer try to keep balanced. In some games, the choice of a given race has a cost in generation points, to reflect the advantages a race can give. In race-driven campaigns, the functionalities can play a central role. For example, in Cats ! (La Mascarade) (2010), the PCs are cats, with the following consequences: This influences the decisions of the player, i.e. the roleplay. In some games, the race has an influence on the choices made by the player. The influence can be prescribed by descriptions of the cultural background: the ‚ÄúRacial preferences‚Äù in AD&D; impels the character to behave in a given way with other characters, and each cult and culture in RuneQuest Glorantha describe the way the character sees the world. In some other games, the influence on choices is impelled, and sometimes enforced, by the rules. Some game designers consider that creating a rule to induce a role-playing choice is suitable: Some other consider that such rules limit the freedom of choice of the player and impedes the immersion: For example, in many role-playing games based on medieval Japan, the notion of honour is specific to the Japanese people (‚Äúrace‚Äù); it is handled in different ways: * honour is represented by a statistic that varies according to the acts of the character: ** the first dedicated role-playing game, Bushido (1979) uses a statistic called On; ** in the first edition of AD&D; Oriental Adventures (which takes place in Kara-Tur, 1985), the character has ‚ÄúHonor‚Äù points that influences some game parameters (e.g. the reaction rolls that tell if a NPC have a positive or negative reaction towards the PCs); ** similarly, in the Fighting Fantasy gamebook Sword of the Samurai (1986), the character also has ‚ÄúHonour‚Äù points; the character commits seppuku if the Honour points drop to zero, and a given amount of Honour points is required to activate some magical effects; ** in Land of Ninja (1986), some characters have an Honour characteristic (HON); a positive HON accounts as a bonus to social skills as the PC has a favourable reputation, and negative HON also acts as a bonus, by intimidation; ** the Pathfinder Ultimate Campaign system (2013) proposes the use of a Honor Points that can be spent to have a favour or a gift from an ally NPC, or to have a bonus in social skill rolls; * a player can choose to follow a code of honour that forces him to act in a given way in some situations, to get advantages in reward: ** in GURPS Japan, the character may choose a disadvantage to have additional character points; in the 1st ed. (1988), a disadvantage called ‚ÄúSense of Duty‚Äù obliges the PC towards a given NPC or organisation; the 2nd ed. (1999) provides an additional disadvantage, ‚ÄúCode of Honor‚Äù, that constrains the PC to act according to a moral code; ** in the 3rd edition of D&D; Oriental Adventures (in Rokugan, 2001), there is no longer honour gauge, honour is handled in the same way as an alignment with possibly bonus to honourable characters (at dungeon master's discretion); it is even proposed to replace the alignment system by an honour system, with the same consequences (e.g. honour oriented magic spells and magical objects); ** in Usagi Yojimbo 2nd ed. (2005),Sanguine Productions, 2005, pp. 71-72 ‚ÄúHonor‚Äù is a ‚ÄúGift‚Äù: if the character follows the code of honour, he gets some special features such as negating the feature of an opponent or get a bonus die; * on the contrary, other games do not implement a game mechanism to handle the honour, such as Rolemaster Oriental Companion (1992), ' (2011) or Les Errants d'Ukyo (2012).

Critical response Upam Buzarbaruah of The Times of India reviewed \\"Now that we are done with the pleasantries, let's start a little dissection. First, acting. All the actors in the film have managed to take hamming to the next level. Kharaj Mukherjee, Shantilal Chakraborty, Supriyo Dutta, Biswajit Chakraborty and Shankar Chakraborty are right up there, at the top. The only non-hammers were the girls in the cast and Hiran, as Ankush, Soham leave no stone unturned to act as loud as possible. But I guess that's maybe because the director wouldn't settle for less. But the result was a hamfest, with each actor trying to out-overact the others. Music.

It was later released on the Nintendo Switch in May 2017, the Xbox One in August 2017, iOS in January 2018, Oculus Go in September 2018, Android in February 2019, Oculus Quest in May 2019, and Stadia in November 2019. The game was shown at the Experimental Game Workshop during the 2015 Game Developers Conference. Gameplay The objective of Thumper is to guide a beetle-like creature along a single or dual track through a series of unnerving worlds. The player must press a button to hit lit \\"notes\\" on the track in time with the background music, while also bracing against obstacles, turning against curved walls, jumping over spikes, and defeating enemies. The game is played in a third-person point of view with an extremely fast scrolling speed. Each level is broken up into segments. After each segment, the player is given a score and a rating showing how well they did. The beetle can sustain one hit (a missed turn or crashing into an obstacle), and at certain places it can regain its shield if it is lost. However, taking a second hit without its wing-shield in place will destroy it, and the level starts over at the last checkpoint. The player can repeat the segment as many times as is necessary to beat the level. Each level in the game features rhythms corresponding to a time signature related to the level number, from 1/2 through to 9/8 A secondary mode, 'Play+', is unlocked for each level after it has been completed. In this mode, the player must progress through the level on one 'life' (though still with the shield allowing one hit to be taken). Dying requires re-starting from the beginning of the level. In addition, the speed increases with the player's score multiplier. Development Marc Flury presents on the game's development at the 2017 Game Developers Conference Thumper was developed by the two-man team of Drool, consisting of Marc Flury, the programmer of the game, and Brian Gibson, the bassist for Lightning Bolt, who composed the music and created the artwork for the game. The design of the game was a collaboration between Flury and Gibson. The game runs on a proprietary engine of Flury's design and has been ported to many different platforms and includes VR support. The game was praised for its rejection of the object-oriented programming paradigm in favor of a procedural programming approach. Much of the game's code was organized via a small handful of large files, some of which reached 6000 lines of C++ code. The game was released for the Nintendo Switch on May 18, 2017. A version for the Xbox One released on August 18, 2017. The game was released on iOS devices as Thumper: Pocket Edition on January 24, 2018. The game was one of the launch titles for Stadia on November 19, 2019. Reception Thumper received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. PC Gamer declared it \\"one of the best rhythm games ever made.\\" Chloi Rad of IGN wrote that \\"Thumpers trippy sights, sounds, and intense rhythm action create a terrifying VR experience I won't soon forget.\\" The Official UK PlayStation Magazine listed it as the second best PS VR game.PS VR Hall of Fame, Official UK PlayStation Magazine, Issue 136, June 2017, Future Publishing, page 108 References External links * 2016 video games Horror video games IOS games Nintendo Switch games PlayStation 4 games PlayStation 4 Pro enhanced games PlayStation VR games Puzzle-music video games Oculus Quest games Oculus Rift games Single-player video games Stadia games Windows games Xbox One games ","title":"Thumper (video game)"},{"id":"46605317","text":"John Cranch may refer to: * John Cranch (naturalist) (1758‚Äì1816), English naturalist and explorer * John Cranch (American painter) (1807-1891), American painter * John Cranch (English painter) (1751‚Äì1821), English painter See also *John Cranch Walker Vivian ","title":"John Cranch"},{"id":"46605321","text":"Wildcat Creek (also known as Millers Creek, Tinklepaugh Creek, or Wild Cat Creek) is a tributary of the Lackawanna River in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately long and flows through Archbald and Blakely. The watershed of the creek has an area of . It has one named tributary, which is known as West Branch Tinklepaugh Creek. The creek may lose flow to coal measures and may receive only intermittent flow even at its source. Only the upper reaches of the creek have a natural channel. It flows through an open box culvert in its lower reaches. The watershed of Wildcat Creek is mainly on residential and commercial land. The creek is a source of flooding in Archbald and Blakely. The creek's course was diverted at least once in the early 20th century and a bridge was constructed over it in the late 20th century. A trail along the creek between the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail and Archbald Pothole State Park has been proposed. The creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Course Wildcat Creek begins in a valley between Hibbard Mountain and Meyers Mountain in Archbald. It flows southeast for several tenths of a mile before leaving the water gap and crossing a highway. Near the Archbald Pothole, the creek turns south-southwest for approximately two miles, entering Blakely and receiving West Branch Tinklepaugh Creek, its only named tributary, from the right. Soon afterwards, the creek crosses Pennsylvania Route 247 and turns southeast. After a short distance, it turns southwest for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Wildcat Creek joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Wildcat Creek has one named tributary, which is known as West Branch Tinklepaugh Creek. The watershed of West Branch Tinklepaugh Creek has an area of . Wildcat Creek also has an unnamed second-order tributary. Hydrology At its mouth the peak annual discharge of Wildcat Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 1079 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 2102 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 2700 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 4020 cubic feet per second. Upstream of the confluence of the tributary West Branch Tinklepaugh Creek, the peak annual discharge of Wildcat Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 814 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 1632 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 2188 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 3148 cubic feet per second. In November 2000, Wildcat Creek was found to have no flow in any of its reaches. It may receive only intermittent flow from its source and may also lose flow to coal measures. Downstream of US Route 6, the creek contains sediment, stormwater, and runoff from culm piles and parking lots. This reach is described in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan as \\"a sediment-choked, storm water ditch\\". A permit was once requested to discharge stormwater into the creek. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Wildcat Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The creek has a high gradient in a reach of its headwaters. One reach of Wildcat Creek has been affected by channelization. Other reaches of the creek have been affected by urban development and mine rock. The only reach with natural conditions is a high- gradient reach near its headwaters. This reach is long and has a stable streambank. The headwaters of the creek are on rocky terrain with no wetlands. Within a few hundred feet of its headwaters, it flows through coal measures. Downstream of US Route 6, Wildcat Creek is impacted by piles of culm on one of its banks and commercial land on the other bank. A stable streambank does not occur in this reach. The final mile (two kilometers) of the creek is in an open concrete box culvert surrounded by lawns and houses. The channel is fenced in this reach and there is no natural channel left. Some ridges in the vicinity of Wildcat Creek contain an irregular covering consisting of glacial till. This glacial till mostly contains sand with 30 or 40 percent gravel. There are also some large boulders. Some of the ridges are made entirely from glacial till. A mountain is located in the western part of the watershed. Watershed The watershed of Wildcat Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Olyphant. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Carbondale. The watershed of the creek is in the central part of the watershed of the Lackawanna River. Wildcat Creek is a third-order stream. The creek's watershed is mainly on residential and commercial land. However, in the late 20th century, the majority of the watershed was on forested land. Approximately 20 percent of the watershed contained residential development, most of which was located near the Lackawanna River. A small part of the watershed contained commercial development. Additionally, abandoned mining land is also in some areas of the watershed. There are few conservation opportunities for the lower reaches of the watershed. Wildcat Creek is a source of flooding in Archbald and Blakely. Some property owners in Archbald have experienced basement flooding due to the creek. History and recreation Wildcat Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1200060. The creek is also known as Wild Cat Creek, Millers Creek, or Tinklepaugh Creek. In the early 20th century, the Hudson Coal Company altered the course of Wildcat Creek to Archbald. This was done to aid coal mining in the area. However, in the 1930s, they filed an application to the Water Power and Resources Board to divert back towards Jermyn. Nevertheless, the creek's mouth is currently in Blakely. Wildcat Creek has a history of flooding within the borough of Archbald. A flooding event occurred on the creek in 1902. In one flood, it washed out a retaining wall made of stone and damaged several lots. It may be vulnerable to future flooding due to bank erosion. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying Main Street over Wildcat Creek was built in 1991. It is long and is situated in Blakely. The final mile of the creek was reconstructed in an open box culvert between 1994 and 1997. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that the boroughs of Blakely and Archbald include protection of Wildcat Creek in their zoning plans. The remains of the rail corridor of a spur of the New York, Ontario and Western Railway have the potential to be converted into a rail trail along Wildcat Creek, linking Archbald Pothole State Park to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. Biology The drainage basin of Wildcat Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. In its upper reaches, there are native trees and understory plants along Wildcat Creek. Further downstream, there are some successional plants along its banks, but most of its riparian buffer is either bare or made of concrete. The creek lacks a riparian area in its lower reaches.

When her husband was elected President of the newly formed Queen's College Cork, Lady Kane refused to move there, preferring to stay in Dublin, tending to her collection of exotic plants. The Kanes had seven surviving children, including Robert Romney Kane and Henry Coey Kane. She died 25 February 1886 in Dublin. Botanical work The 1833 Linnean botanical work The Irish Flora, which was published anonymously, is ascribed to her. Katherine was aged 22 at the time of its first publication and although not a large work, it was one of the first of its kind, and lauded for its accuracy. The book became the recommended botany text in Trinity College, Dublin as it contained the first record of many plants. It is believed John White, of the Irish Botanic Gardens, helped with the compilation of the work, and that it was Dr. Walter Wade who encouraged her in this work. In 1836, the then 25-year-old Katherine became the first woman to be elected member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, and her herbarium is housed in University College Cork. She had an interest in the cultivation of trees, writing about the subject for the Irish Farmer's and Gardener's Magazine.

In the event of a hazardous situation, the actuator was simply isolated from the energy supply. This type of protection system could be manipulated in the event of a malfunction, disabling the protective function. Special relay circuits, such as the three-contactor combination, were the first designs to come out of deliberations into how this could be avoided. These device combinations led to the development of the first safety relay from the German automation manufacturer Pilz, the PNOZ.Practical Machinery Safety (Google eBook), David Macdonald, Newnes, 16.07.2004, Chapter 5: Emergency-stop monitoring and the safety relay, p. 112 et sqq.  Description  In the event of a hazard, the task of safety functions (e.g. E-STOP, safety gate or standstill monitoring) is to use appropriate measures to reduce the existing risk to an acceptable level. These many safety functions include: * Emergency stop pushbuttons * Safety gates * Light beam devices * Pressure sensitive mats * Two-hand controls * Time delay As such, safety relays monitor a specific function. When connected to other safety relays, they guarantee full monitoring of a plant or machine. They meet the requirements of EN 60947-5-1, EN 60204-1 and VDE 0113-1.Practical Machinery Safety (Google eBook), David Macdonald, Newnes, 16.07.2004, Chapter 5: Emergency-stop monitoring and the safety relay, p. 113 et sqq.  Design and function  The design technology is the main difference between the safety relays: * Classic contact-based relay technology \\"force-guided contacts relay\\" * With electronic evaluation and contact-based volt-free outputs * Fully electronic devices with semiconductor outputs Safety relays must always be designed in such a way that, if wired correctly, neither a fault in the device nor an external fault caused by the sensor or actuator will lead to the loss of the safety function.Safety Compendium, Chapter 4.1, Safety relays p. 116 A normal relay uses a wire coil and the mechanical movement of the metal contacts to switch the load on and off. The metal contacts may weld shut after repeated operation cycles. If this happens, the machine would continue running if the operator pressed the emergency stop pushbutton. This would be hazardous for the operator. For this reason, many European, American, national and international norms and safety standards prohibit the use of simple relays or contactors on hazardous machines.Safety compendium, Chapter 4.1, Safety relays p. 118 The typical design of a first-generation safety relay is based on the classic three-contactor combination. The redundant design ensures that wiring errors do not lead to the loss of the safety function. Two relays (K1, K2) with positive-guided contacts provide the safe switching contacts. The two input circuits CH1 and CH2 each activate one of the two internal relays. The circuit is activated via the start relay K3. There is another monitoring circuit between the connection points Y1 and Y2 (feedback loop). This connection is used to check and monitor the position of actuators, which are activated or shut down via the safety contacts. The device is designed in such a way that any faults in the input circuit are detected, e.g. contact welding on an emergency off/emergency stop pushbutton or on one of the safety contacts on the output relay. The safety device stops the device switching back on and thereby stops the activation of relays K1 and K2.

He previously served as mayor of Metkoviƒá from 2013 to 2016, and Deputy Prime Minister in the Cabinet of Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá from January until his election as the Speaker in October 2016. Since 2012 he has been leader of the Bridge of Independent Lists party. Petrov resigned his position as the Speaker on 4 May 2017, amidst a government and parliamentary crisis. Having held the office for a little over six months, Petrov is to date the shortest serving Speaker of the Parliament since 1991. Early life and family Petrov was born in Metkoviƒá to locksmith Jakov, and Marija Petrov, a bookkeeper. He has an elder sister, Nikolina, and two younger brothers, Branimir and Ivan. Petrov attended elementary school in his hometown and high school (classical (Christian) gymnasium) in Sinj. At the age of 14 he decided to join the Franciscan order, but eventually changed his mind. Petrov graduated from the Medical Faculty of the University of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and specialized psychiatry in the Psychiatric Hospital Vrapƒçe in Zagreb, after which he worked as a psychiatrist at the University Clinical Hospital in Mostar. He is married to Ma≈°a Petrov, a primary school teacher with whom he has three sons: Jakov, Dominik and Andrija. Political career Petrov began his political career as an independent candidate in the 2011 parliamentary election on the list of the conservative Croatian Growth (Hrast) party. He eventually ended his collaboration with Hrast because \\"they betrayed its members and sided with the HDZ\\", which he did not approve. On 17 November 2012, Petrov and other local politicians and activists life founded the Bridge of Independent Lists (Most) as a regionalist political platform and was chosen as its first president. In 2013, the Bridge of Independent Lists participated in the local elections in the town of Metkoviƒá. The party won 46.25% of votes and 9 out of 17 seats in the City Council. Petrov won 45.78% of the votes and entered the second round of election for the mayor against Stipe Gabriƒá Jambo, incumbent mayor since 1997. In the second round Petrov won with 67.94% of the votes and became the mayor of his hometown. At the same election, Bridge of Independent Lists won 9.97% of the votes in county elections and entered the County Assembly of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. As mayor, Petrov cut his and the city councillors' wage to the minimum. Finding a city debt of HRK 17.6 million, he managed to bring it down by 6.4 million, or 36%. His deputies work as volunteers, while the councillors' fees amount to a symbolic 1 HRK. Petrov abolished also the compensation to the members of supervisory boards and management councils, and representation expenses decreased by 10 times and travel costs by 8 times. He also terminated several expensive public contracts, and introduced transparency in public spending. His work to sanitize the city's budget got him to be declared the best mayor in the region. After having halved the city debt, he increased the salaries of the city administration, but they remained 30% lower than they were at the time he took office as mayor.Hrvoje Prnjak: Petrov stvara koaliciju nezavisnih: Mogu biti premijer, ali ƒáu predlo≈æiti drugoga. Slobodna Dalmacija, 2. veljaƒçe 2015. Pristupljeno 2. veljaƒçe 2015. 2015 parliamentary election For the 2015 parliamentary election, Petrov's Most party went national and was joined by independent local politicians from other parts of the country. Led by Petrov, the party campaigned for fiscal responsibility, reduction of government spending and public debt, tax cuts, reforms in the public sector and the reduction of administrative divisions in Croatia. Petrov's party turned out the surprise of the election, with 13.17% of the votes and 19 seats in the Croatian Parliament. The party had a crucial role in forming the new government and started negotiations with the ruling centre-left Croatia is Growing coalition, centred around the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and the opposition centre-right Patriotic Coalition, centred around the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). Members of the party said that they won‚Äôt join any of the two coalitions in forming the new government unless their reform agenda is adopted. After more than 40 days of negotiations and numerous twists, Most decided to give its support to a government led by the HDZ, giving them a slim majority of 78 seats. They nominated the Croatian Canadian businessman Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá to be the next Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister (2016) The new government was approved by the Sabor on 22 January 2016. Petrov was named Deputy Prime Minister. Along with Petrov, six ministers in the government were nominated by Most. In February, the Most party prepared amendments for reducing benefits of members of the parliament, but the bill was stopped and did not reach voting in the Sabor. The party accused HDZ and SDP for blocking the bill. In March, Petrov and his party announced amendments to the law regulating the rights of former presidents of Croatia that would rescind the Office of the Former President. This move revoked the entitlements of former president Stjepan Mesiƒá, who criticised the move, and saved around 600,000 HRK to the government budget. In the same month, Petrov started negotiations with labour union representatives over a 6 percent wage increase for public sector workers, as GDP grew over 2% for two consecutive quarters. The wage rise was signed in 2009 by the Government of Ivo Sanader with labour unions. The government had not planned funds for the wage increase in the 2016 budget and wanted to negotiate new terms of the contract, as there was no money for its implementation. Relations between Most and the Patriotic Coalition have long been strained and continued to deteriorate in May. Members of HDZ started talking about reshuffling the government. After it was revealed that the wife of Tomislav Karamarko had business with the consultant of Hungarian oil company MOL, Petrov and his party called for Karamarko to resign due to political responsibility. A vote of no confidence was started by SDP in the Sabor, which was backed by ministers and MPs from the Most party. After Karamarko refused to step down, Petrov said that he and ministers from his party are ready to resign if Karamarko remained in the government, adding that \\"an individual should never be above the state\\". On 3 June, in an attempt at a compromise solution, Prime Minister Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá called on Petrov and Karamarko to resign for the sake of stability of the country. Ore≈°koviƒá said that their relations have become a burden for the government. Petrov responded that he is ready to step down if it will help stabilise the situation in the country, while Karamarko refused to resign and stressed out that Ore≈°koviƒá no longer has the support of HDZ. A vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister was initiated by HDZ. Petrov's party continued to support Ore≈°koviƒá and asked for the resignation of Karamarko. On 16 June the confidence vote took place in the Parliament that resulted in the fall of Ore≈°koviƒá's government by a vote of 125 MPs in favour, 15 against and 2 abstentions. Both HDZ and most of the opposition voted in favour, while the Bridge of Independent Lists voted against. Speaker of Parliament (2016‚Äì2017) Petrov was elected as the 11th Speaker of the Croatian Parliament on 14 October 2016 with 132 members of Parliament voting in favor, 1 against and 12 abstaining. Having taken office two days before his 37th birthday, Petrov became the youngest person ever to hold the position of the speaker. As per a post-election agreement between Petrov's Bridge of Independent Lists party and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) led by Prime Minister Andrej Plenkoviƒá, Petrov was due to serve as Speaker for a 2-year period and would thereafter have been replaced by Speaker from the HDZ, presumably the party's general secretary and former Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokoviƒá.http://www.grude-online.info/petrov-predsjednik- sabora-dvije-godine-nakon-njega-dolazi-jandrokovic/ Petrov resigned from office on 4 May 2017 amidst a government crisis which began on 27 April 2017 when Prime Minister Andrej Plenkoviƒá removed three government ministers supported by Petrov's Most party and escalated further to a point where Plenkoviƒá's Croatian Democratic Union began to gather signatures for Petrov's removal from office via no confidence vote. Croatian Parliament formally dismissed him from his position as Speaker on 5 May 2017. Petrov remains a member of the Parliament. He was succeeded as Speaker by the former Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Gordan Jandrokoviƒá on 5 May 2017.

During reforms at Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP or \\"Parchman\\") in Sunflower County, as part of settlement of a class action suit, the state closed Unit 32, which included the prison's Death Row and other prisoners in lockdown. Numerous prisoners with mental illness were transferred to East Mississippi Correctional Facility, which is to provide specialized treatment. Other prisoners were transferred to WCCC to improve their conditions, and the facility was converted to maximum-security level. But, the rate of violence began to rise at WCCC due to the influx of prison gang leaders and members from Unit 32. Eighty-six percent of prisoners at Wilkinson now belong to gangs for protection. WCCC became known as the \\"New Unit 32\\" and \\"The Killing Field.\\" The violence rate at WCCC from 2011 through June, 2013, under CCA management, exceeded any state-operated prisons.

Flowers' family filed suit against CCA, settling for an undisclosed amount. In 2013 MDOC commissioner Chris Epps replaced CCA, awarding MTC a five-year contract to manage WCCC.

In mid-2012, MTC had been awarded a contract to manage three other private prisons in the state: East Mississippi Correctional Facility, Marshall County Correctional Facility, and Walnut Grove Correctional Facility (WGCF). It took over these facilities from the GEO Group, which was forced out as part of a settlement of a class-action suit over conditions at WGCF. The fifth private prison is Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility, managed by CCA for the state. The violence rate at WCCC did not decline after the new management took over, although the company says that it is making improvements. A prisoner at WCCC is estimated to have a one-in-seven chance of experiencing assault, exceeding the one-in-fourteen chance of a prisoner held at Parchman. In October 2014 journalist Jerry Mitchell of The Clarion Ledger stated that if WCCC was a city of 100,000, it would have murders of more than 111 people per year. Mitchell said this was twice the homicide rate of the city of Detroit, which had an annual murder rate of 54.6 per 100,000. On May 25, 2014, inmate Kendrick Walker was stabbed 81 times, resulting in his death. Convicted of a non- violent crime, he had been a year from release after serving a 10-year sentence. A videotape suggests that tower guards contributed to his death, but none was prosecuted. The warden took nearly 27 minutes to reach the tier with backup; by then Walker was dead. Former MDOC Commissioner Robert L. Johnson had opposed Mississippi contracting for private prisons. After viewing the videotape of the assault on Walker, he said, \\"Honestly, I think it is symptomatic of the profit motive that drives a lot of the corrections industry instead of concern for public safety.\\" According to the Clarion-Ledger, CCA has annual revenues surpassing $1.7 billion, and \\"a CEO pulling down more than $3.2 million in salary and benefits.

In February 2015 both men pleaded guilty in plea bargains and cooperated with FBI investigators in a far-reaching case known as Operation Mississippi Hustle.

Background  At the end of World War II, the farm structure in Albania was characterized by high concentration of land in large farms. In 1945, farms larger than , representing numerically a mere 3% of all farms in the country, managed 27% of agricultural land and just seven large estates (out of 155,000 farms) controlled 4% of agricultural land, averaging more than each, compared to the average farm size of at that time.Statistical Yearbook of the Popular Republic of Albania 1963, Department of Statistics, Tirana, 1964  Land-to-the-tiller reform  The first post-war constitution of independent Albania (March 1946) declared that land belonged to the tiller and that large estates under no circumstances could be owned by private individuals (article 10). The post-war land reform of 1946 redistributed 155,000 hectares (40% of the land stock) from 19,355 relatively large farms (typically larger than 5 hectares) to 70,211 small farms and landless households. As a result, the share of large farms with more than 10 hectares declined from 27% of agricultural land in 1945 to 3% in 1954. By 1954, more than 90% of land was held in small and mid- sized farms of between 1 hectare and 10 hectares.  Collectivization reform  The distributive effects of the post-war land reform were eliminated by the collectivization drive of the late 1950s-early 1960s, and by 1962 less than 18% of agricultural land had remained in family farms and household plots, while the rest had shifted to Soviet-style collective and state farms). By 1971, independent family farms had virtually disappeared and individual farming survived only in household plots cultivated part-time by cooperative members (approximately 6% of agricultural land).  Privatization reform  The post-communist land reform begun in 1991 as part of the transition to the market was in effect a replay of the 1946 land reform, and the arable land held in cooperatives and state farms was equally distributed among all rural households without regard to pre-communist ownership rights. Contrary to other transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Albania adopted a distributive land reform (like the CIS) and did not restitute land to former owners. The post-communist land reform of the 1990s was accompanied by special land privatization legislation, as Albania was the only country outside the former Soviet Union that had nationalized all agricultural land (in stages between 1946 and 1976).Z.

It was established in 1947, and contains around 90% of those eligible for membership. During the 1946‚Äì47 Ashes series, the Australian and British cricket media spent around eight months travelling around together covering the matches, and during this time they established an informal \\"Empire Cricket Writers' Club\\". This placed the idea in the minds of a number of journalists for a formal association, and so in June 1947, the Cricket Writers' Club was started. Although it was established significantly later than other such organisations around the world, it triggered the creation of the Football Writers' Association and the Sports Writers' Association in the United Kingdom within six months. In 1950, the Cricket Writers' Club began awarding a Young Cricketer of the Year award, and have since introduced a number of other awards which are presented at their annual dinner.

Produced by Will Yip, the album was released on May 4, 2015 through Run for Cover Records. Following the release of their debut album Magnolia (2013), Turnover parted ways with original guitarist Kyle Kojan, replacing him with Eric Soucy. For Peripheral Vision, Turnover returned to producer Will Yip, who shares songwriting credits on the entire album. It was recorded at his studio, Studio 4, in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. The album finds the band shifting from their pop punk origins to a more atmospheric, dream pop-type sound. Peripheral Vision peaked on at number four on Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, and critical reviews were largely positive, focusing on its stylistic progression. Background and production Turnover formed in Virginia Beach, Virginia in 2009 and released their debut album, Magnolia, in 2013. By that time, the group‚Äîcomposed of vocalist/guitarist Austin Getz, drummer Casey Getz, bassist Danny Dempsey and guitarist Kyle Kojan‚Äîhad been touring consistently for several years. They felt ready to move the band into a more part-time project if significant steps forward were not made in their sound and performance. Guitarist Eric Soucy joined Turnover in 2014. Danny Randon of Upset wrote that Soucy had a \\"major influence\\" on the band's composing process. In March, a four-way split EP was released featuring Turnover, Such Gold, Maker and Ivy League, TX. Turnover's contribution was the song \\"I Would Hate You If I Could\\". Bassist Danny Dempsey considered the song their \\"first step at walking away\\" from the style of their first album, Magnolia (2013). In August 2014, it was announced that the band would be working with producer Will Yip. While working in pre-production, Yip was as thrilled with the new material as the group was. Recording took place at Yip's studio, Studio 4, in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. Yip handled production duties and engineered the sessions, with assistance from Colin Gorman. Yip mixed the recordings with Vince Ratti, and Ryan Smith mastered the album at Sterling Sound in New York City. Composition All of the songs that ended up on the album were credited to the band and Yip. The album's sound has been described as indie rock, pop, and dream pop. The shift in sound was unintentional according to singer/guitarist Austin Getz, who noted the band didn't plan on \\"mak[ing] this kind of record.\\" Getz had been listening to \\"a lot of stuff from the 1980s, late 70s.\\" He and guitarist Eric Soucy would develop guitar parts individually \\"and whatever comes out comes out.\\" The ambient humming heard throughout the album is the result of a Superego guitar pedal. The band had bought the pedal to use on their debut album but didn't \\"utilize it a lot\\", according to Dempsey. For Peripheral Vision, however, the group employed it extensively, making \\"everything sound a lot bigger than it really is.\\" Discussing \\"Cutting My Fingers Off\\", Dempsey noted that it was about \\"things [that] will go wrong in your life and at first you'll think it's okay. [...] but then you realize it sucks.\\" Regarding the song \\"Take My Head\\", Dempsey revealed it was \\"about how it could be the best day and you're surrounded by happy things, but you still want to be pissed off and sit by yourself.\\" Release On March 10, 2015, Peripheral Vision was announced for release. The album's artwork was also revealed. A day later, \\"Cutting My Fingers Off\\" was made available for streaming. In March and April, Turnover supported New Found Glory on their tour of the U.S. On this tour, the band were selling burned CDs of \\"Cutting My Fingers Off\\". Despite the fact the album wasn't released by this point, the band played seven songs from it. Referring to their past material, Dempsey revealed that the group \\"didn't want to play songs we weren't stoked on.\\" Dempsey later remarked that the tour wasn't ideal for the band. A music video was released for \\"New Scream\\" on March 30. It was directed by the brother of guitarist Eric Soucy, Rob. \\"Cutting My Fingers Off\\" was released as a single a day later. On April 17, \\"Humming\\" was made available for streaming. Peripheral Vision was made available for streaming on April 29 and was released on May 4 through Run for Cover. In June and July, the band supported Fireworks on their tour of the U.S. In August, the band supported The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die and Pianos Become the Teeth. In September and October 2015, the band supported Lydia on their tour of the U.S. In October and November, the band supported The Story So Far. In January 2016, the band toured alongside Citizen in the UK and Europe. Following this, the band tour the U.S. with Citizen again, as well as Sorority Noise and Milk Teeth in March and April. On May 16, a music video was released for \\"Humming\\", directed by Rob Soucy. The video features a women walking through a desert community, which contains \\"a series of different people including ballerinas, mariachi bands, and other desert eccentrics\\", according to Noisey. Later in May, the band supported Basement on their tour of Australia and headlined the Ice Grill$ Tour in Japan. In June, the band went on a headlining east coast tour of the U.S. with support from Sports and Secret Space, and a headlining west coast tour of the U.S. in August with support from Triathlon. In early October, the band supported Moose Blood on their tour of the UK. From mid October to early November, the band went on a headlining tour of Europe with support from Sorority Noise and Milk Teeth. Reception Peripheral Vision charted in the U.S. on several Billboard charts: number 19 on Alternative Albums, number 4 on Heatseekers Albums, number 15 on Independent Albums and number 28 on Top Rock Albums. Critically, Peripheral Vision was well received. Exclaim! Branan Ranjanathan considered Peripheral Vision to be the group's \\"strongest and most dynamic [work] yet, masterfully incorporating new and adventurous sounds while maintaining the heartfelt authenticity that they've come to be known for.\\" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork commended the band's shift in sound, but criticized what he found as overly obvious lyricism, writing, \\"Though it‚Äôs a warm and often gentle record, not much about Turnover's Peripheral Vision is subtle.\\" Timothy Monger from Allmusic felt the opposite, praising their \\"improved and far more subtle songcraft.\\" Tyler Sharp, writing for Alternative Press, commented that the band \\"[has] managed to progress into something entirely unique,\\" complimenting its \\"subtle-yet-infectious melodies and drowsy (at times dizzying) instrumentals.\\" Peripheral Vision was listed on Alternative Presss \\"Best Albums of 2015 so far\\" list. It was ranked at number 3 on AbsolutePunk's top albums of 2015 list. Stereogum listed \\"Cutting My Fingers Off\\" on their \\"The 5 Best Songs Of The Week\\" list.
