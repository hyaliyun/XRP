Geology and geomorphology  The rock complex of Tustan is composed of eroded remnants of sub-vertically incident sandstone layers of the Yamna formation of the Palaeogene. They are characterised by the nearly vertical bedding of sedimentary strata with their exotic mattress-like and globe-shaped textures. The form and character of the rocks depend on weathering conditions and the lithologic composition of sandstone. During the Mesozoic and the Paleocene Epoch of the Cenozoic, during the time of the then-existing Tethys ocean, thick layers of silt accumulated here. About 25 million years ago, in the Paleocene Epoch of the Cenozoic, along with the formation of the Carpathian Mountains, sandstones were formed, some of which rose to the surface. In geology, they are known as Yamna sandstones; the name is derived from the former village of Yanma. The complex of Urych rocks is made of separate remnants: Kamin (Ukr. ‚Äúrock‚Äù), Ostryi Kamin (Ukr. ‚Äújagged rock‚Äù), Mala Skelia (Ukr. ‚Äúsmall cliff‚Äù), Zholob (Ukr. ‚Äúravine‚Äù). In some places, sandstones jut out as great monoliths, in other places, they are chaotically piled boulders. There are many cracks, recesses, and small caves, including man-made. The rock complex of Tustan  Origin of the names  The name ‚ÄúTustan‚Äù has an Old Slavonic origin. It is a compound noun made of two parts: Tu + Stan. Such type of names is known in Sanscrit, Ancient Greek, and Celtic, and is typical to Slavic names known from the monuments of the 6th‚Äì7th centuries. For example, these are the names of Ants chieftains and Byzantine military leaders of Slavic origin: Dobrohost, Kalihost, Mezhmyr, Tatymyr, Khvalybud, etc. The ancient folk etymology, recorded by the Polish historian Stanis≈Çaw Sarnicki in 1585, and the modern oral tradition interpret the name as ‚Äústand here‚Äù.  History  In the 9th century, the territory of modern Tustan was populated by tribes of White Croats. At the end of the 10th century, Croatian principalities that were formed in the basin of the San River, the Upper and Middle Dnister, and the Upper Prut River, were conquered by the Kyivan Rus Prince Volodymyr Sviatoslavych and annexed to Kyivan Rus. In the mid-12th century, Tustan, together with such towns as Peremyshl, Zvenyhorod, Sanok, Horodok, Yaroslav, Vyshnia, Holohory, Synevydsko, Spas, Stara Sil, Lviv, Drohovyzh, Sambir, and Tukhlia, was part of the Peremyshl Principality. Later, the fortress was the main regional border center between the Galician-Volynian Principality and Hungary, and after former became part of the Kingdom of Poland ‚Äî between the Kingdom of Poland and Hungary. The oldest record of Tustan was of 1340 in the text of the Polish chronicler Janko of Czarnk√≥w, who was a vice chancellor of the Polish King Kazimierz III. In his chronicles, which covered the events between 1363 and 1384, among the towns and fortresses of the Rus land, newly overtaken by the king, he mentioned ‚ÄúLemberg, or Lviv, the town of Peremyshl, the town and fortress of Sanok, the town of Korosno, the fortresses of Lubachiv, Terebovlia, Halych, Tustan.‚Äù While Janko of Czarnk√≥w said nothing about the occupation of Tustan, the other Polish chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz (1415‚Äî1480) directly points to the fact that in 1340 ‚Äúduring one summer, King Kazimierz takes over the whole Rus‚Äù: ‚ÄúKazimierz... on the birthday of John the Baptist moved to the Rus land and occupied the towns and fortresses of Peremyshl, Halych, Lutsk, Volodymyr, Sanok, Lubachiv, Terebovlia, Tustan, other Rus towns and fortresses‚Äù. The records by those two chroniclers indicate that Tustan as a defence fortress had existed before it was taken over by the Polish king in the 14th century. Archeological findings prove the same thing. The oldest documented record about Tustan was in a letter of Pope Boniface IX of May 15, 1390. It says that W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Opole handed down the town of Rohatyn, the castles of Olesko and Tustan, with their hamlets, property, and all their fields and a tithe of the profit of salt mines in Drohobych and Zhydachiv to the newly formed Galicia Catholic diocese. Besides its defensive role, Tustan had an administrative function as a center of volost. It was testified by the royal charter for the village of Krushelnytsia of November 4, 1395. It says that the village of Krushelnytsia of the Tustan volost was granted to obedient servants, Ivan and Damian, and their sons with all its property: forests, pasture grounds, fields, and hayfields. Later, the fortress was overtaken by Polish magnates and gentry. Which was testified by the royal charter of 1539. The king, at the request of Jan of Tarn√≥w, grants to Mikolaj Blizinski and his heirs ‚Äúthe fortress of Tustan, that is, the rocks only in the Stryi mountains near the border with Hungary‚Äù. They promised to ‚Äúdefend, restore, reinforce, and maintain this castle on the rocks‚Äù. It is not known if the fortress of Tustan was restored and reinforced, but in 1541 Blizinski granted the village of ‚ÄúPidhorodtsi and the fortress of Tustan‚Äù to Jan of Tarn√≥w. Tustan was a customs site. A salt trade route went through it. The route started in Drohobych, went through the village of Tustanovychi, Tustan and the village of Pidhorodtsi, and then along the valleys of the Stryi and the Opir reached the Carpathian passes and went down to the western European countries. Toponyms like Pidhostynets, Hostynets and mount Tovar indicate the existence of the trade route. Tustan guards collected customs from merchants and ensured their protection during goods shipment. The fact that the fortress of Tustan existed till the 16th century was proven by the archeological expedition findings and by documents: the last records about the fortress was dated by 1565, in an inventory of the Drohobych saltworks. It said: ‚Äú...in Tustan they collect customs duty from merchants who travel over the mountains, passing by Drohobych. Customs duty... is 14 zloty‚Äù. Several factors caused the gradual decline of the fortress: 1) Economic: in the 16th century, the countries of Central Europe started their own salt quarries, hence no demand for salt from Galicia. Tustan ceased to be a customs site. 2) Political: Tustan ceased to play any role of a border defence fortress because of stabilised political relations between Poland and Hungary and shifting the Polish border further east. 3) Military: Tustan lost its defensive function due to changes in military equipment and military tactics.  Architecture  3D model of the fortress The cliff-side city and fortress of Tustan has a special place in wooden construction of the Middle Ages. Rock formations, which are mighty defence walls themselves, were smartly used by builders. Gaps between rocks were closed with wooden walls, preventing any approaches to the fortress. Special cuts ‚Äì grooves and hollows ‚Äì were made in rock surfaces to secure log structures. Those traces allow recreating the appearance of the fortress during the 9th‚Äì16th centuries, despite the fact that the log structures were not preserved. Only on the rock complex Kamin of Tustan, over 4,000 traces of the cliff-side construction were detected and studied. Having analysed all traces, the main researcher of Tustan, Mykhailo Rozhko, came to a conclusion that the fortress was built in several stages; then it was constantly built up, grew taller and claimed the top grounds of the rock complex. In the 13th century, during the period of its heyday, the fortress embraced all possible galleries and terraces from the very bottom to the top. The height of the complete construction in the courtyard reached five storeys, each 3.5‚Äì4.0 m tall, which is a sign of a very advanced level of construction technology. For water supply during siege, the fortress had a well at the bottom of the rocks and two cisterns. As of today, only the remains of the stone wall survived. Mykhailo Rozhko dated the wall construction with the 2nd half of the 13th century. The wall was 2.5 m thick and covered the grooves cut in the rock surfaces for wooden walls.  Archeology  During the archeological investigations of the fortress of Tustan over 25,000 archeological findings were collected. Among them were wooden elements from the construction, metal items, pottery, glass, and leather goods. The most interesting metal items are an engolpion, a ring head with an engraved image of a bird, a bronze mace, a sledge-hammer, an axe, arrowheads for a crossbow, arrowheads for a longbow, spearheads, fire strikers, spurs, bell clappers, cutters, wood chisels, needles, and book clasps. Wooden findings are represented with a number of wooden structures, among which are fragments of six doorposts, pole structures of galleries, fragments of beams, treenails, boards with dovetails joints, laths, shingles, wooden spoons, and a spade. The discovered fragments of pottery are dated by the 9th‚Äì16th centuries. Also, there were tiles, some fragments of which bear the image of George the Dragonslayer.  Petroglyphs  Petroglyph of Tustan Rock surface images (petroglyphs) belong to a vast and somewhat mysterious area of monuments of ancient culture and art. Rock images of Tustan are mostly located on the largest and central group, Kamin, and are in difficult to reach places. Among all Tustan petroglyphs, the researcher Mykola Bandrivskyi paid attention to a group of images shaped like a circle, a disk or schematic roundish figures. Such signs are called solar signs. The researcher analysed the location of those solar signs and came to a conclusion that they were put on rock surfaces in accordance with a certain system. However, not all researchers agree with the theory about the handmade origin of ‚Äúsolar signs‚Äù. In particular, a professor of geology Bohdan Ridush proved that those are natural reliefs of petrified sponges, which appeared in the process of sandstone weathering. Handmade petroglyphs also survived in Tustan. Individual images of animals are particularly interesting: a wolf chasing an elk, a horse and a rider. During archeological excavations led by M. Rozhko, on the slopes of Velyke Krylo (Ukr. ‚Äúbig wing‚Äù) a group of petroglyphs was discovered, including five axes, two crosses, and one swastika. A large group of petroglyphs could have been created in the 18th‚Äì20th centuries, when the rocks of Tustan were a well-known tourist attraction. A significant group of the monuments is made of heraldic signs. They are mostly tridents as well as symbols of various organizations.  Research of Tustan  Scientific interest in the rocks in Urych appeared in the 19th‚Äì20th centuries and was associated with folklore studies. In the 20th century, Y. Pasternak, O. Ratych, P. Rapoport, and R. Bahriy studied Tustan. In 1971-1978, Mikhailo Rozhko, together with a group of enthusiasts, systematically measured the existing traces of the construction and made the first reconstructions of the fortress. In 1978, a new stage in the research of Tustan began with an expedition of the Lviv Regional Organization of the Ukrainian History and Culture Protection Society. In 1979-1991, the expedition was transformed into the Carpathian Architectural and Archeological Expedition at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine under the supervision of Mykhailo Rozhko. The systematic study by Mykhailo Rozhko of the Tustan rock formations allowed the researcher to carry out a spatial and volumetric reconstruction of the fortress complex of Tustan with the rock group of Kamin in the center and separate defence and guarding points on Ostryi Kamin and Mala Skelia. The reconstruction of five periods of the fortress‚Äô wooden construction was done based on the archaeological findings, architectural and archaeological measurements of the rocks with traces of the construction and remains of brick walls. The survey of similar landscape-architectural objects with traces of wooden structures located in Bubnyshche, Rozghirche, Pidkamin, and other fortified sites not far from Tustan also allowed to make conclusions about the nature of the construction and the architecture of Medieval fortifications, located in mountainous, rocky places, and to define the monument‚Äôs place in the complex of the then-defensive objects of the Eastern Carpathians.  Tustan Site Museum  In order to protect the Tustan site, the Tustan State Historical-Cultural Reserve was established in 1994 by the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The Lviv Historical Museum was in charge of the reserve. In 2005, a special administration was formed. In September of 2016, it was restructured under the Lviv Oblast Council as a municipal body named ‚ÄúThe Administration of the Tustan State Historical and Cultural Reserve‚Äù. Later, its name in English was changed into the Tustan Site Museum, which is used today.  Sources  * Rozhko V. Methods of Graphical Reconstruction Of Log Cliff-Side Architecture / V.

One of the Italian tornadoes used in the operation  Description  Following the invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq, on September 25, 1990 the Italian Government sent eight multirole fighter bombers Tornado IDS (plus two spare) in the Persian gulf, belonging to the 6¬∫, 36¬∫ and 50¬∫ Stormo, which were deployed at the Al Dhafra Air Base, near Abu Dhabi, in United Arab Emirates. These planes formed the \\"Autonomous Flight Department of the Italian Air Force in the Arabian Peninsula\\". The Department's staff, initially made up of 239 men, including twelve Carabinieri of the Air Force for supervisory needs and military police, was subsequently brought to 314 elements. The deployment of Italian aircraft was part of the international security system implemented by UN Security Council Resolution 678. The use of Italian aircraft as part of the Desert Storm operation represented the first operational employment in combat missions of Italian Air Force aircraft after the end of World War II. During the 42 days of war, Italian fighters made 226 sorties for a total of 589 flight hours. General Mario Arpino was head of the Air Coordination Unit during the war operations in Saudi Arabia from October 1990 to March 1991. Added to this commitment is the activity carried out by the RF104-G tactical reconnaissance aircraft (for a total of 384 sorties and 515 flight hours) operating in Turkey under the NATO AMF (ACE Mobile Force NATO) . This cell had been resettled on the Anatolian peninsula on 6 January 1991, in the face of a decision in NATO, to protect a possible Iraqi attempt to widen the conflict, and the support of transport aircraft, which carried out 244 missions for 4156 hours of flight, ensuring logistical support for national air and naval units as well as the evacuation of nationals from areas at risk. The RF104-G returned to Italy on March 11, 1991. The Tornado fighter jets returned to the Gioia del Colle air base on March 15, 1991, two weeks after the end of the military operations. The return of Italian fighter planes to the homeland was welcomed by a ceremony attended by the Minister of Defense Virginio Rognoni, the Chief of the Defense, General Domenico Nardini, and the Chief of Staff of Italian Air Force, General Stelio Nardini.  Loss of an aircraft  During the conflict, the Italian Air Force recorded the loss of a single aircraft. On the night between 17 and 18 January 1991, the first military mission of Italian aircraft departed. Major Gianmarco Bellini (pilot) and captain Maurizio Cocciolone (navigator) took off on board their fighter- bomber along with the other seven Italian aircraft and a formation of allied aircraft for the first mission that saw them employed in the airspace controlled by Iraqi forces. The squadron's mission was an areal depot (provisioning, ammunition and means) in southern Iraq, northwest of Kuwait City, defended by radar-enslaved anti-aircraft artillery. Bellini and Cocciolone, like many others from the base of the Emirate, were the only ones capable of completing refueling in flight; all other aircraft, including 7 Italian Tornados and about 30 other aircraft from other countries, hindered by weather conditions, failed to approach the aircrew and had to return to base. Bellini, as head crew, decided that their aircraft would have to go on alone, despite the risk posed by the enemy's defensive deployment. Received the ok by the air tactical command, the aircraft leveled at about 250 feet of altitude, activated the automatic control TF and unhooked the war load (5 Mk 83 bombs) on the target around at 4.30 in the morning. After about 40 seconds their plane was hit by Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery, trained to defend against low- altitude attacks, and the two Italians had to launch themselves with the ejection seat. The plane hit the ground about 20 km northwest of the Kuwaiti capital, a few hundred meters from an Iraqi Republican Guard barracks. The two airmen were immediately captured by Iraqi troops, separated, confiscated everything they had with them (including clothing and boots) and forced to wear a yellow suit, which qualified them as prisoners of war. Major pilot Gianmarco Bellini and Captain Navigator Maurizio Cocciolone were released at the end of the conflict, along with the other prisoners of war captured by the Iraqi forces.

Life and work Gladys May Mabel Brooke-Pechell was born in Cannanore, India, the daughter of Sir (Augustus) Alexander Brooke-Pechell, 7th Baronet,A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Peerage and Baronetage, the Privy Council, Knightage and Companionage, Sir Bernard Burke, Ashworth P. Burke, 72nd ed., 1910, p. 1430 colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps. She was educated in England. Her only art education was when she was briefly taught by Andr√© Derain. After marrying Bonamy Dobr√©e in 1913 they went to live in Florence, returning to England with the start of World War I. She exhibited her figurative oil paintings with the London Group in 1920, becoming acquainted with Dora Carrington and Roland Penrose. In 1920, with Nancy Cunard, she was briefly involved with the bohemian scene in Paris but soon Dobr√©e and her husband moved to Larrau in the French Pyrenees in 1921 ‚Äì at this time she exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants. In 1926 they went to live in Cairo where she wrote her novels Your Cuckoo Sings by Kind, published 1927, and The Emperor's Tigers 1929. They returned to England in 1929 to live at Mendham Priory, Harleston, Norfolk where their daughter Georgina (who became a distinguished clarinetist) was born the next year. Dobr√©e's first solo exhibition of thirty-four works was at the Claridge Gallery, London, in 1931. Her book of stories To Blush Unseen was published in 1935. The Dobr√©es in turn lived in Earl's Colne, Essex, and Collingham, West Yorkshire, before returning to London in 1950. The Institute of Contemporary Arts mounted an exhibition of her collages in 1963 and in 1965 her book of poetry This Green Tide was published by Faber and Faber. T. S. Eliot and Graham Greene admired her writing. The University Gallery, Leeds own some of her paintings and they held a retrospective exhibition in 2000. Fine art collage, a 20th-century innovation, was a technique she used in the years around 1930 and her work was highly regarded ‚Äì Herbert Read owned some of her art. The Times reported on 9 December 1931 'Her designs, mostly cut out of patterned wallpapers, are definitely and very intelligently \\"cubist\\"'. Due to poor health and World War II her output became reduced but in the 1960s she returned to collage, albeit from her bed, and held exhibitions at the Zwemmer Gallery. Involvement with Bloomsbury Group Dobr√©e was vivacious, voluptuous and unstable and, as she encountered members of the Bloomsbury Group, some Bloomsberries became particularly attracted to her. She and her husband had an open marriage ‚Äì he accepted her extramarital affairs. She became Mark Gertler's lover and he painted portraits of her in 1919 and 1920. Dora Carrington had met her at the Slade School of Art and when they met again much later in 1920 she found her unconventional and independent as well as artistic ‚Äì the sort of woman Carrington admired. Lytton Strachey found her interesting (despite her marriage he thought her \\"perhaps a saph\\") but did not think she was clever. In 1922 Dobr√©e's indiscretion started \\"The Great Row\\" (as it was later called by Frances Partridge) amongst the m√©nage √† trois of Strachey, Carrington and her husband Ralph Partridge. Carrington, only recently married to Ralph Partridge, was having an occasional rather chaste affair with Gerald Brenan. She was keeping it secret from her husband who was openly having affairs with a number of other women. Dobr√©e told Ralph that while he and his wife had been staying at the Dobr√©es' house in the Pyrenees, she had agreed to distract him so Carrington could be alone with Brenan. Partridge became enraged with his wife when she initially denied the story ‚Äì he regarded her deceit as more shameful than his infidelity. Despite attempts to calm matters by Strachey and Virginia Woolf, the marriage was damaged although they continued together for some time with Carrington having to accept that Dobr√©e had now also started an affair with her (Carrington's) husband and then, later, with Brenan.

The Greenland Inuit refer to the red walrus as saanniartoq, \\"the one who turns against one\\".

Based in Toronto, Ontario it principally offers mutual funds targeted to high net worth retail investors, although it also offers other financial products and services, such as exchange-traded funds and wealth management. As of September 2019, it had a total of $177.4 billion in assets under management and advisement. As of March 31, 2020, it reported preliminary assets under management of $112.2 billion and assets under advisement of $43.7 billion, for total fee-earning assets of $155.9 billion. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as and is also a component of the S&P;/TSX Composite Index.  History  CI Financial was founded in 1965 as Universal Savings Fund Management Ltd. It was a small private firm until 1994, when it held an IPO on the Toronto Stock Exchange as C.I. Fund Management (the C.I. stood for Canadian International). In the next 9 years, it increased in size by 10 times. In 1999, Bill Holland became CEO of the company, a position that he was to hold for more than 10 years. Also in 1999, the company acquired BPI Financial Corp. for $206 million, creating Canada's fifth-largest public mutual fund company. in 2003, CI purchased the Canadian operations of financial firm Assante Corp. for $846 million. As a result of this acquisition, and two others at the same time, CI became the second largest fund management company in Canada. In 2005, CI changed its name to CI Financial, to reflect the diversity of its activities. In 2007, it acquired Rockwater Capital for $250 million. This deal allowed CI to expand into the investment banking business. In 2008, Sun Life Financial sold its 37% ownership in CI to Scotiabank for $2.3 billion. Scotiabank made the purchase to strengthen its relatively weak wealth management business. Sun Life had held the stake until before 2003. In 2010, CI acquired Hartford Investments's Canadian operations. In 2014, Scotiabank sold most of its stake in CI, in part due to conflicts with the management of the company. In 2015, CI acquired First Asset Capital Corp., allowing it to expand into offering exchange-traded funds. In 2017, CI acquired Sentry Investments for $780 million. The deal was intended to lower costs through consolidation. Also in 2017, CI acquired BBS Securities Inc., parent company of online brokerage Virtual Brokers, due to its investment in Fintech.

As part of the settlement, CI Investments agreed to make a payment of $49.3 million to investors in its mutual funds that were affected by market timing trades carried out by third party investors in certain mutual funds managed by CI Investments. In 2016, CI reached a no-contest settlement with the OSC to pay $156 million to 360,000 investors in its mutual funds. The settlement was due to CI Investments miscalculating the net asset value of certain funds, by not properly accounting for interest earned from 2009 to 2015. CI Investments also paid an $8 million voluntary payment to the commission. This settlement agreement resulted in the largest amount of compensation paid to investors pursuant to a no-contest settlement agreement in Ontario.

The company's main business is the sea carriage of new and used cars and High and Heavy cargo. The name of the brand EUKOR comes from a portmanteau that combines together the words \\"Europe & Korea\\". Company profile EUKOR is a South Korean company owned by Wilh. Wilhelmsen along with Wallenius Lines, Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics, American Roll-on Roll-off Carrier, and United European Car Carriers. The company tonnage comprise 80 PCC-PCTC vessels transporting about 4 million cars every year, mainly from South Korea to the US and Europe. The main business consists in the maritime transport and distribution of cargo such as automobiles, trucks, trailers, Mafi roll trailers, heavy construction machineries and further types of rolling freight. Since 1999, when mv Asian Destiny was launched, the fleet started to include ships capable of carrying over 6,000 cars per voyage. Over half of the fleet's vessels include the word ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù in the first part of their names. The tonnage name idea is linked to the fact that Korea started to be internationally referred as ‚Äúthe Land of Morning calm‚Äù, and its ruling monarchy the Joseon, became known abroad as the ‚ÄúMorning Dynasty‚Äù, when a book written in 1886 by Percival Lowell obtained large success in the United States in narrating the history of the country. History Before its re-branding as EUKOR in 2002, the pre-existing company was known as the RORO-Car Carriers arm of Hyundai Merchant Marine. The division was inaugurated in the 1980s when its first car carrier vessel was purchased and named mv Hyundai No.1. Since then, three shipping lanes to Europe, Australia, and India were opened, to compete with the three Japanese shipping lines NYK, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, and K Line, in the cars transportation and break bulk sectors. After the purchase by Wilh. Wilhelmsen and Wallenius Lines, the two Scandinavian companies each took 40 percent of the equity in the Hyundai car carriers division, whilst the two cars manufacturers Hyundai Motors and Kia split the remaining 20-percent equity stake. The two Korean carmakers committed to continue to ship their products exclusively through the new joint venture. The main purpose of the acquisition was to enable the two Swedish companies to fully enter the extremely profitable Korean export market. Through the deal, Wallenius and Wilhelmsen acquired a fleet of nearly 60 vessels that were carrying over 2 million vehicles per year. The acquisition required antitrust approval from the European Commission. To obtain this approval, the parties agreed to terminate the WALLNYK collaboration with Nippon Yusen Kaisha and agreed not to enter into any similar agreements with any competing carrier on the routes in question, without prior Commission consent. Facts and accidents On May 24, 2004 the EUKOR operated vessel Hyundai No.105, sailing from South Korea to Germany, collided with a Japanese very large crude carrier (VLCC) close to Singapore Sentosa island in the Malacca Strait, one of the world's busiest sea passages. As result the Hyundai No.105 sank with a total loss of over 3,000 brand new Hyundai/Kia cars and an additional 1,200 used Japanese cars stowed on board. The crew was rescued but the ship could not be salvaged. On January 6, 2010 the British flagged mv Asian Glory, carrying about 2,400 cars, most of them new Hyundai and Kia models, was sailing from South Korea to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia when it was captured by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Asian Glory had a crew of 25, including 8 Bulgarians and 5 Indians, who were finally released in June 2010 following a ransom payment of an undisclosed amount that intelligence reports indicated was close to the $15 million that the pirates were demanding; allegedly, an amount similar to the ship's hull insurance cost and the value of the cargo on board. On April 19, 2014 a fire started on mv Asian Empire off the coast of Japan, when the vessel was en route from Ulsan to Balboa, Panama. All 24 members of the crew had to be evacuated. A second fire broke out hours later; the reasons were investigated but remained unclear. Two salvage tugs had to be hired to tow the vessel to China for dry docking. In 2015 China fined EUKOR 284 million yuan ($42.5 million) for engaging in a cartel. A similar fine was applied to its sister company WWL. In 2016 Brazilian regulators raised a similar claim and required EUKOR to pay 15.9 million reais. In 2017 a further suit was brought by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission for price fixing and conspiracy. On February 21, 2017 the mv Morning Composer was hijacked by Libyan pirates off the coast of Misurata. The vessel was carrying 3,500 Korean brand new cars and 1500 used vehicles. The crew of 12 Filipinos, 10 Bulgarians and 2 Ukrainians were unharmed and freed to restart the journey briefly after the Libyan military intervened on 22nd early morning. On 28 May 2019, while alongside Ulsan port, a sudden fire broke out on a car deck of the EUKOR operated mv Platinum Ray. The immediate action of the crew and fire brigades could contain the fire and extinguish it within five hours, limiting the damage to only 69 cars of the over 2000 stowed on board.

In 1988 at Roskilde University, she became the first Danish woman to be appointed a full professor of mathematics. She has also played a leading role in the development of education and research networks, both in Denmark and at the European level. Early life, education, and family Born on 8 January 1948 in Hiller√∏d, she was the daughter of the medical specialist and academic Knud Henning Olesen (1920‚Äì2007) and the physician Irene Mariane Pedersen (1919‚Äì2004). After matriculating from Sortedam Gymnasium in Copenhagen, following in her parents¬®footsteps she began to read medicine at Copenhagen University, hoping to become a biophysicist. As this was not possible, she studied mathematics instead, graduating in 1973 and receiving the university's gold medal for a dissertation on operator algebra. She went on to Odense University where she received a Lic.Scient (equivalent to a PhD) in mathematics in 1975. She also went on study trips to Philadelphia (1971‚Äì72), Marseille (1974 & 1979) and Berkeley (1984‚Äì85).

Working as an intelligence gatherer and confidential agent for the United States in the War of 1812, Smith was captured at Fort Mackinac in an attempt to inform Lieutenant Porter Hanks of the impending war. Smith served as a captain in the War of 1812 and was present during the surrender of Detroit under General William Hull. Smith also served as an Indian interpreter-liaison for the United States and helped negotiate the release of several white families taken prisoner by Native American tribes.  Family and early life  Jacob Smith was born to a soap-maker of Canadian and German descent in Quebec, Canada, and learned to speak fluently in English, French, and the Chippewa-Ottawa dialect of the Algonquin language. Smith married his first wife, Mary Reed, on July 25, 1798 in the Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Quebec. They went on to have five children while Smith began working in the family butchery. He later married a Native American woman, with whom he had one child, while engaging in the fur trade.  Native American relations  Smith began his career as a fur trader among many Native American tribes along the Flint and Saginaw Rivers. Known for being honest in his dealings, assimilating to Native ways of life, and greatly admired for his skills in woodcraft, Smith became very close and well trusted among the Native Americans in the Michigan Territory. Smith had a confidence placed in him that no other white man had in the region and was given the Indian name of \\"Wahbesins,\\" meaning \\"Young Swan,\\" by the Chippewa tribe. Smith helped the United States government secure land from many Native American tribes, playing a key role in the 1807 Treaty of Detroit and the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw, which ceded millions of acres of land to the United States that make up a majority of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. = Treaty of Detroit = The 1807 treaty, made in Detroit with the Ottawa, Chippewa, Wyandot and Potawatomi nations, ceded to the United States present-day Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio and was hailed as the first major land cession in the region. = Treaty of Saginaw = Reluctant to cede more land in the central portion of Michigan's Lower Peninsula during the 1819 talks, in what was deemed to be a hunter and fisherman's paradise, the Chippewas secured an ample number of land reservations in the area from the United States government. Smith played a very influential role in securing these treaties, even proposing the eventual compromise in the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw, which set aside eleven, 640-acre sections of land for the Chippewa tribes located near the Grand Traverse of the Flint River. Each of the 114 Chippewa chiefs that eventually signed onto the treaty had previously interreacted with Smith and knew him to be an honest and hospitable fur trader. He used these connections to help move the process forward on behalf of the United States government. For his efforts in helping broker the Saginaw Treaty, Smith received five hundred dollars from the Territorial Governor of Michigan, Lewis Cass, and was hailed as a wise counsel during the talks. = Boyer Family release = In addition, Smith rendered admirable service in using his relationships with Native American tribes to help liberate prisoners captured by Indians ‚Äì to which the Boyer family release in the summer of 1814 was the most notable. After the Boyer home was burned by Indians and the family taken captive, Smith went into the local village with a horse full of saddled goods to use as ransom. The Boyer family was released unharmed as the Indians were impressed by Smith's bravery in coming to the village. = Henderson Family release = Smith also helped aid in the release of the Henderson family from a Saginaw tribe in late July 1812. After David Henderson, his wife, and their children were taken prisoner, Smith talked to Saginaws, with whom he was friends, with and convinced them to release the Henderson family.  The War of 1812  Smith served in the Michigan Militia during the War of 1812 under Captain Richard Smyth's Company of Twelve Months Volunteers Cavalry from June 30 to August 16, 1812 and was present during the surrender at the Siege of Detroit. = Saginaw Mission = Using his close relations with many Native American tribes, Smith helped gather intelligence for the United States government during the war. In one instance, Smith rode into a Saginaw village with two assistants pretending to be on a trading expedition in an attempt decipher the tribe's position in the war and level of sympathy to the British cause. One of the assistants, while drunk in the village, unknowingly revealed to the tribe that they were spies ‚Äì a mistake that cost him his life. Smith managed to escape the village but sustained a permanent eye injury when brush caught his face while fleeing in haste on horseback. By successfully gaining the information needed in this very dangerous mission, Smith was immediately made a captain in the Michigan Militia. = Fort Mackinac Mission = In July 1812, Smith embarked upon a journey to Fort Mackinac in an attempt to alert Porter Hanks about a potential British attack at Mackinac Island after learning about the American declaration of war against Great Britain. British commanders found out about the declaration of war many days before Americans in Detroit did, let alone the commanding officer on Mackinac Island. Smith clashed with the Detroit Postmaster, James Abbott, whom he accused of intentionally delaying the mission. Abbott denied Smith's mission was government business, which resulted in a national controversy after the fact. Smith left Detroit traveling alongside three Native Americans, one of whom was a young Ottawa carrying an important wampum with a message from his chief that advised the northern Michigan Indians not to join the British cause in the war. When Smith arrived in Saginaw along his journey he met with veteran fur trader Charles Girard to disclose that he was carrying letters for American authorities on Mackinac Island alerting them of the war declaration. However, Smith was detained by pro-British Indians in Saginaw on the suspicion that he was working on behalf of the United States. Knowing of this possibility, Smith had prepared by hiding the American orders and wearing a British military breast plate underneath his clothing. When he revealed to the Indians the British breast plate, they presumed him to be a British agent and were assured he was not working with the Americans. This act of foresight by Smith allowed him to trick the Saginaw tribe into releasing him as he told them he was going north on a mission for the British Army. While the Indians followed Smith and his compatriots to make sure he told the truth, Smith told Girard that if his true identity was compromised to ensure the return of the American orders to Postmaster Abbott in Detroit. The Indians eventually stopped following Smith and he ultimately reached Mackinac. However, unknown to Smith was that the fort had been taken by the British just days earlier. Flying an American flag on the canoe to the island, Smith was taken prisoner by British forces. Smith's imprisonment did not last long as he hired three Indians to smuggle himself and his crew out. Hiding in canoes down the Au Sable River, Girard and Smith eventually made it back to Detroit.  Flint  Smith is credited as the first white settler in Flint, Michigan. He located his first trading post there in 1810 where the grand trail from the Detroit River and Grand Traverse of the Flint River separate and lead to Saginaw and Birch Run ‚Äì a central point which made it very easy to trade with the Native Americans. While Smith's trading post was founded in 1810, it was not his permanent residence as he continued to live in Detroit until 1819. After the death of his wife, Mary Reed, and the signing of the Treaty of Saginaw, Smith built a sizeable log trading store in Flint in 1819. This became his permanent residence until his death and was the first building erected by a white man in present-day Genesee County.  Death and legacy  Before the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw, Smith lived in Detroit at the current corner of Woodbridge Street and Woodward Avenue. His family continued to live there after his death in 1825 while Smith's son-in-law, Major John Garland, took possession of the trading post in Flint. Smith, the earliest white pioneer in Flint, also became the first white pioneer to die in Genesee County after passing in poor condition in 1825 from heart problems. = Treaty controversies = In the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw, many Native American names were listed to receive the various reservations outlined in the compromise. Later, five of the eleven reservations came under intense national debate. Smith wrote into the treaty five Native American names that were willed reservation numbers seven, eight, nine, ten, and eleven. After his death, it was discovered that these reservations were actually willed to Jacob Smith's five white children under Native American names that were given to them by Indians who frequented their house in Detroit. Lewis Cass later wrote about knowing of Smith's plan and added a clause in the treaty to curtail Smith's proposal by outlining that reservations could only be granted to true Indians. The children claimed the land, but the United States government refused to grant the land titles. After petitioning Congress and getting ten of the original 114 Chippewa chiefs who signed the Treaty of Saginaw to testify that it was the original intention of the treaty that Smith's children would inherit the land, some of the land in the reservations was granted to the Smith family. Although Smith died penniless, his children eventually inherited great sums of property from his work. = Legacy = Years after both Smith and Ne-o-me, the principal of the four chiefs of the Pewanigos of the Flint River, with whom Smith was very close, had died, the Indians spoke of them as brothers. While Jacob Smith was an influential and controversial figure in his lifetime, his name garners very little attention in Michigan history today. Regardless, his settlement in Flint grew to become a major city that has played a critical role throughout Michigan's history.

It now houses the Ionia Community Library. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and is part of the Historic American Buildings Survey. History Frederick Hall was born in Vermont in 1816, and moved to Michigan in 1836. He came to Ionia in 1841 and began buying and selling timberland, eventually becoming probably the richest man in the county. He was appointed by President James K. Polk as the receiver of public money for the land office at Ionia in 1845. He was elected to serve in the state legislature in 1849, and was later a candidate for Congress and for Lieutenant Governor. He became the first mayor of Ionia in 1873, and was a director of the Ionia and Lansing Railroad and President of the First National Bank of Ionia. In 1869-70, Hall hired Capt. Lucius Mills to construct this house for his family. Hall lived here until his death in 1883, after which the house passed on to Hall's daughter, Marion Hall-Fowler, and her husband Joshua Lounsburgy Fowler. Joshua Fowler died in 1901; Marion gave the house to the city of Ionia in 1903 as a memorial to her parents and husband, to be used as a public library. Description The Hall-Fowler Memorial Library is an immense two-story Italianate building with a service wing to the rear. The building is constructed of variegated ashlar sandstone, ringing from yellow gray to reddish brown, and has a low hip roof with extended eaves with highly ornate bracketed cornices.

Thomson, Mrs Charles Cummings Collins, Gerhard Sisters Photo July Hargadine Thomson Collins (December 9, 1872 - October 16, 1929) was the founder and manager of the Night and Day Camp, a St. Louis city camping for the cure of tuberculosis targeting the poor women population of the city. Biography July Hargadine Thomson was born on December 9, 1872, the daughter of William Holmes Thomson (1837‚Äì1920), vice-president of the Boatmen's Bank and a leader in the St. Louis Veiled Prophet organization, and Anna Lou Hargadine (1851‚Äì1934). In 1895 she married Charles Cummings Collins (1872-1922), an attorney. Her children were Anne Collins Taussig (1896‚Äì1951), July Comfort Collins Anderson (1897‚Äì1929), Mary Virginia Collins Glogau (1903‚Äì1978) and Elizabeth Cummings Collins. July H. Thomson became interested in the charity work in 1911 and at once began energetically raising all the money necessary to erect and equip a Night and Day Camp for poor girls of St. Louis who were threatened with tuberculosis. Since the opening of the camp she had been in active charge of it, and spent much of her time in the conduct of the business of that institution. This camp was located at 9500 South Broadway, in a large oak grove, overlooking the Mississippi River. It was opened March 19, 1913. The capacity was for twenty-eight girls. It was conducted as a preventorium against tuberculosis for self-sustaining girls and women. More than fifty girls, from department stores and factories, were admitted. Over thirty were discharged as practically cured. Dozens of women, ill, but compelled to earn a living, were there able to receive the best medical and nursing care, and got the much needed proper nourishment and complete rest during their \\"off-duty hours.\\" While the camp was primarily established for the prevention of the disease, it accomplished more. With the restful surroundings and good influence the entire viewpoint toward life of the patient frequently changed. Melancholy was lost, ambition was aroused, nerves were quieted, the spirit of unselfishness grew. It was the only one of its kind in the United States, exclusively for women. The patients took absolute rest for three weeks, and then, if able to resume their work, returned to the camp each night, until thoroughly rehabilitated. The treatment was absolutely free of any expense, except car fare to and from the camp. The ground was first broken for the building August 31, 1912. The first patient was admitted March 19, 1913. The total cost of construction was $6,231.80 ($ in dollars). The capacity only twenty-eight. The number of patients admitted in the first years was fifty-two, and the number discharged thirty. The greatest gain in weight in the shortest time (three months), fourteen pounds. All expenses considered, the cost of each patient per month was $24.90 ($ in dollars), and per day, covering six meals, was 83 cents ($ in dollars); cost for night patients was 55 cents ($ in dollars). It cared for working girls who contracted the disease in its incipient stages, and by giving them plenty of good, fresh air, and a healthy diet of eggs and milk, enabled them to throw off the disease. To let people die from tuberculosis was a crime, when for a little money those who developed the early stages could be entirely cured. While the movement for the Night and Day Camp was sponsored by the St. Louis Society for the Relief and Prevention of Tuberculosis, under the immediate direction of Collins, yet the society was never called upon for financial assistance or support. Collins personally solicited numerous cash contributions, directed charity balls, and in conjunction with The St. Louis Times raised many hundreds of dollars in a dime-and-quarter campaign in the St. Louis wholesale, retail and business establishments. The proceeds from these and other sources went towards the construction of the camp, its equipment and maintenance. Helen Gould also sent a very liberal donation, which was set aside as a nest-egg toward an endowment fund. The fact which made the camp a possibility was the gift of the land from the Laclede Gas Light Company. There were four acres of land with the house almost squarely in the middle. It was but a short distance from the Broadway car line, consisting of an administration building, built on a bungalow type, with two dormitories ‚Äî one extending winglike from either side, and a kitchen in the rear. The dormitories were constructed with a wooden base and screened walls. Along either side was a row of compartments, in each of which were two beds. The patients were sleeping in the open, but were under a comfortable shelter. The front lawn was used for the recreation grounds ‚Äî it was strewn with steamer chairs, hammocks swinging from many trees, and a number of croquet sets ‚Äî this being the least strenuous form of recreation for girls in their condition. There were also chicken yards, gardens, and dove cotes, for the girls to raise their own vegetables, poultry and squabs, all of which went to supply the camp's table. They had a piano, mandolins, graphophones, to amuse them. Most of the time the girls spent out in the open. The rising bell, at 7:30 a. m., with breakfast at 8:00, was the beginning of camp rules. After that was feeding the chickens, working in the gardens, but for the most part, resting and eating ‚Äî six times a day did these girls eat. The food given them was of the most nourishing variety, in the way of soups, meats, poultry, milk and eggs; ice cream was one of the favorite desserts. Men were tabooed, not even a janitor was employed on the grounds. The patients were of all ages over fifteen. There were school teachers, newspaper writers, trained nurses, stenographers, factory workers and shopgirls ‚Äî more of the two latter occupations. As soon as the girls or women entered this home they were impressed with the fact that they were not hopelessly ill, and with proper rest and diet could recover. The girl whose constitution was undermined with too much work must first build up her health in order to fight off the disease. Rose Ryffle was an excellent nurse a graduate of the Baptist Sanitarium, and under her capable direction everything works very smoothly. Medical attention was furnished by Dr. Walter Fischel and his staff. In nearly every instance the girls who left the camp as cured returned to employments that bring them better wages than those they received when they were forced to drop their work and go to the camp for restoration. Some of the girls who went there were unable to relinquish their work, the money they received in wages being required in home life. But even this did not prevent them from receiving the benefits of the camp. At the end of their day's work they came back to receive their supper, their lunch at nine, and their sleeping accommodations, as well as breakfast. This costs the camp fifty-five cents. Briefly, it was possible for a rundown, susceptible or affected girl to continue her self- supporting employment and still receive care, attention and cure in the camp. This treatment was such that recently a girl gained eight pounds in a single week. In one instance, a girl badly in need of such care and who could not sacrifice her wages of four dollars a week, was taken in and her mother given the four dollars until she was again able to go out and take her position. Many cases like this were cared for. The pupils of Lenox Hall raised enough money to purchase furniture for one room, and since then maintained two beds. They formally dedicated the room and a brass plate was put on the door. Collins did a great work in founding this camp, and she was justly gratified in knowing that she perhaps laid the way for the healing and care of thousands of girls who benefited by her movement. During the winter of 1917-1918, Collins founded the \\"Y\\" Canteen Union Station who fed 131,584 soldiers coming back from World War I. It was sponsored by the Young Women's Christian Association women and employed 210 volunteers. According to John R. Mott, national head of the Y.M.C.A., it was \\"the greatest canteen in the United States; the greatest in the world after that at Bordeaux, France\\". She died on October 16, 1929, and is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery. References 1872 births 1929 deaths American women philanthropists ","title":"July H.

They are used by prey, to avoid being seen by predators, and by predators to help them approach their prey. The eye has a distinctive shape and dark coloration dictated by its function, and it is housed in the vulnerable head, making it a natural target for predators. It can be camouflaged by a suitable disruptive pattern arranged to run up to or through the eye, sometimes forming a camouflage eyestripe. The illusion is completed in some animals by a false eye or false head somewhere else on the body, in a form of automimicry. Disruptive eye masks are seen on a variety of animals, both invertebrates such as grasshoppers and vertebrates, including fish, frogs, birds and snakes. Eye masks were first noticed by the American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer in 1909, and analysed extensively by the zoologist Hugh Cott in 1940. However, in 2005 the evolutionary zoologist Tim Caro could still observe that the assumption that eye masks served as camouflage had not been tested systematically. History Early investigators Abbott Handerson Thayer and Hugh Cott noted that active juvenile birds like this little ringed plover chick have boldly disruptive patterns that camouflage the eye. Cott used this diagram to illustrate \\"the inherent conspicuousness of an eye-spot\\", and hence to justify the need for a disruptive eye mask. The American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer mentioned the \\"masking\\" of the eyes of birds and mammals in his 1909 book Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom, stating that this was found mainly in birds, such as plovers, and predatory mammals. He noted that \\"it is very effective .. as it completely breaks the eye's otherwise conspicuous circular or oval outline. The zoologist Hugh Cott identified the value of concealing the eye in his 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals. He notes the \\"inherent conspicuousness of an eye-spot\\", which \\"stands out from everything else, and rivets the attention\\", making the point with a diagram containing one small eyespot and many larger features: the eyespot immediately attracts the viewer's attention. The image has been used elsewhere, for example in Tim Newark's 2007 book on camouflage, where Newark noted that Cott's image proved the point, as \\"the eye of a vertebrate, with its dense black pupil, stands out from the most jumbled backgrounds, as Cott's illustration demonstrates.\\" Cott argued that \\"no scheme of camouflage will be completely effective which does not mask or modify the appearance of the eye\\". He mentioned, as \\"beautiful examples\\" of face patterns that achieve this, the swamp viper and the Gaboon viper. In his words: Cott described disruptive eye masks as a special case of a coincident disruptive pattern, one that provides camouflage by joining together parts of the body to create a new appearance which contradicts the actual structures present. On camouflage eyestripes, he noted that \\"more or less well-defined ocular bands or stripes\\" are found in many species of bird, including the nuthatch, snipe, whimbrel, ringed plover, and turnstone, and thought it significant that these patterns were associated with active young that leave the nest early, as in the ringed plover. He recorded that \\"what appear to be markings of similar significance\\" are found in mammals such as gemsbok, sable antelope, Grant's gazelle and vizcacha. In 1989, J. L. Cloudsley-Thompson noted that camouflage eyestripes are also found in many reptiles including slender arboreal vine snakes, numerous tropical fish such as the angelfish and garfish, and a wide variety of amphibians including the common frog. The evolutionary zoologist Tim Caro observed in 2005 that \\"the whole topic of disruptive coloration needs systematic analysis\\". Caro noted that in mammals, \\"no systematic tests of this idea are available\\", but that dark patches around the eyes, which would tend to draw attention to the eye instead of camouflaging it, are associated with grassland and terrestrial carnivores as well as riparian animals, suggesting the function of reducing glare, or perhaps of aposematism. Pattern G. W. Barlow, noting Cott's examples, analysed fish \\"eye-lines\\" in 1972, finding a relationship between angle of line and both body shape and angle of forehead. He found that fast-swimming species had longitudinal lines and long bodies; deep-bodied fish had vertical bars and the ability to turn abruptly. Many barred patterns were in his opinion \\"obviously an adaptation for crypsis\\" (camouflage). He concluded that stripes and bars were both social signals and antipredator adaptations. In 1981, Leah and Benjamin Gavish tested patterns that conceal birds' eyes using patterns and human observers. They found that patterns which allow the eye to protrude from the dark area concealed the eye best, calling this the \\"borderline eye effect\\". Some animals such as butterflyfish combine the camouflaging of the eye with an eyespot somewhere else on the body, possibly giving the impression that the animal's head is located there. In 2013, Karin Kjernsmo and Sami Merilaita showed using artificial prey and predatory fish (three-spined sticklebacks) that such eyespots diverted predators' attacks from the vulnerable head.

Under the emergency powers that operated during the Emergency, over 1,300 members or supporters of the Nyasaland African Congress (Congress) were detained without trial, and most of the party's leaders including its president, Dr. Hastings Banda, were imprisoned in Southern Rhodesia after being arrested on 3 March. Many other Africans were jailed for offences related to the Emergency, including rioting and criminal damage. In the week before the Emergency was declared and during its first month, over 50 Africans were killed and many more wounded by the colonial security forces, which included many European troops from Southern Rhodesia. Others were beaten by troops or armed police or had their huts destroyed and their property seized during punitive operations undertaken during the Emergency.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 352‚Äì9. Nyasaland had a history of problems arising from the limited access that African peasant farmers had to agricultural land, and of opposition to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which Nyasaland had joined in 1953. Although opposition to Federation was at first limited to a relatively small group of educated Africans, the imposition of agricultural rules designed to reduce soil erosion, which took significant amounts of land out of cultivation and involved additional work by the smallholders affected, made it more widely unpopular. On his return to Nyasaland, Banda used dissatisfaction with these schemes to spread his message that Nyasaland should leave the Federation.McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 238-9. The stated aim of the State of Emergency was to allow the Nyasaland government to restore law and order after the increase in lawlessness following Dr Banda's return to the protectorate in July 1958. However, it is clear from government documents released in the 1990s that the British Colonial Office took the view that, if Nyasaland were to remain in the Federation, Banda and Congress had to be neutralised, and that the Federal Government under its Prime Minister Roy Welensky wished to ensure that African nationalists, in Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia as well as Nyasaland, would not interfere with his plans to achieve Dominion status for the Federation and reduce British influence in its two northern territories following a constitutional review due in 1960.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 62, 86.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 346-8. After a short initial period of rioting, damage to property and strikes after the Emergency was declared, most of the strikers returned to work and Nyasaland became calm but tense, apart from remote areas in the Northern Region, where resistance continued for several months. This unrest was countered by a campaign of harassment by troops and police, including hut burning, arbitrary fines and beatings. However, Armitage had no plans to resolve the political crisis in Nyasaland, other than expecting that the elimination of Banda and Congress would allow alternative politicians willing to cooperate with the colonial government to emerge. Instead, the Malawi Congress Party was formed as the successor to the banned Nyasaland African Congress in August 1959 and rapidly grew into a larger mass-movement than Congress had been.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 355‚Äì6, 360-3. By the end of 1959, the new Colonial Secretary, Iain MacLeod realised that he would have to negotiate with Banda, and that such negotiations would involve ending the Emergency, releasing the remaining detainees and Nyasaland's eventual withdrawal from the Federation.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959 pp. 211, 218. Armitage strongly resisted Macleod's proposals, particularly the release of Banda and other former Congress leaders, and it was unlikely that he would be able to negotiate effectively with Banda on constitutional progress. Because of his strong opposition to the release of Banda and others and their return to Nyasaland if they were released, British ministers decided to nominate Armitage's successor on 1 April 1960, the same day that Banda was released. The State of Emergency ended on 16 June 1960: Armitage was seen as an obstacle to progress, and he left Nyasaland permanently in August 1960.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 248, 265-7. At the end of 1958, the Colonial Office had concluded that allowing Congress to continue as a legal political party under Banda's leadership was incompatible with the continued existence of Federation, so it decided to eliminate Congress using emergency powers. Within a year, it reached a similar conclusion regarding the Malawi Congress Party and Federation, but in view of the strength of African opposition, it decided that Federation could only be imposed on Nyasaland through the use of significant force for an indefinite period, something that the British government was not prepared to do.Darwin (1994), The Central African Emergency, 1959, p. 228 Unrest in Nyasaland=Land issues= The violent uprising of John Chilembwe in 1915 was an expression of the frustration of educated Africans denied an effective political voice and of the grievances of ordinary Africans denied a share in the benefits of the colonial economy as well as of religious radicalism.Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 80‚Äì3. After the Chilembwe rising, protests against colonial rule were muted and concentrated on economic and social improvement for Africans, with political advancement a distant aspiration. However, a 1930 declaration by the British government that white settlers north of the Zambezi could not form minority governments able to dominate local Africans stimulated political awareness.Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 101‚Äì2, 118‚Äì22. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the most pressing problem was African access to land. Between 1892 and 1894, about 15% of the total land area of the Nyasaland, including some 867,000 acres, or over 350,000 hectares of the best land in the Shire Highlands, the most densely populated part of the country, had been turned into European owned estates.Pachai, (1978). Land and Politics in Malawi 1875‚Äì1975, pp. 36‚Äì7. Africans who were resident on these estates were required to pay rent, normally satisfied by their undertaking agricultural work for the owner under the system known as thangata, which later developed into a form of sharecropping in some areas.Pachai, (1978). Land and Politics in Malawi 1875‚Äì1975, p. 84. For many years, neither the Nyasaland government nor British government had dealt with African land grievances, despite recognising that a problem existed: generally, the supposed needs of the estate owners were given priority. Thangata was regulated by the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928: however, this allowed landowners to evict up to 10% of residents at five-yearly intervals. It did not provide a permanent solution, as it did not deal with the problem of estate land that was under-utilised but not available to African farmers, nor with the owners' ability to evict tenants. The legislation was overtly race-based, as used the category of \\"Native\\" (or African) to determine land rights.Baker, (1993) Seeds of Trouble, pp. 40, 217.Pachai, (1973). Land Policies in Malawi, pp. 688‚Äì70. There were no large- scale evictions in 1933 and few in 1938, but in 1943 hundreds of families in the Blantyre District refused to leave their tenancies as there was nowhere for them to go to, and the colonial authorities declined to use force. The evictions due in 1948 were suspended because of a serious famine: they took place in 1950, but were resisted.Baker, (1993). Seeds of Trouble, 1946‚Äì1964, pp 40, 42‚Äì4. Tensions between estate owners and tenants remained high during the early 1950s. In the overcrowded Cholo district, the British Central Africa Company treated tenants on its tea estates harshly, and there were riots there in 1945. Between 1950 and 1953, the company tried to evict about 1,250 tenants and increase the rents of the rest. Many refused to pay rent or taxes and occupied land on undeveloped parts of company estates. Serious riots broke out in Cholo in August 1953, leading to eleven deaths and seventy-two people injured.Palmer, (1986). Working Conditions and Worker Responses on the Nyasaland Tea Estates, pp. 122‚Äì3, 125. The Abrahams Commission (also known the 1946 Land Commission) was appointed by the Nyasaland government in 1946 to inquire into land issues in Nyasaland following riots and disturbances by tenants on European-owned estates in Blantyre districts in 1943 and 1945. Abrahams proposed that the Nyasaland government should purchase all unused or under-used freehold land on the estates, which would become Crown land allocated to African smallholders as Native Trust Land. Africans on the estates were to be offered the choice of remaining there as workers or tenants, or of moving to Crown land.Tenney and Humphreys, (2011). Historical Dictionary of the International Monetary Fund, pp. 10, 17‚Äì18. The programme of land acquisition accelerated after 1951, and by 1957 the government had negotiated the purchase of most of the land it had targeted. By June 1954, 350,000 acres had been re-acquired, leaving only 3.7% of Nyasaland's land in private estates. At independence in 1964, this had been reduced to less than 2% per cent.Pachai, (1973). Land Policies in Malawi, pp. 691‚Äì2. =Political issues= In the same period that the economic position of Nyasaland's Africans was improving, their political aspirations received a major set-back. Agitation by the government of Southern Rhodesia led to a Royal Commission, (the Bledisloe Commission), on future association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Despite almost unanimous African opposition, its report in 1939 did not rule-out some form of future association, provided that Southern Rhodesian forms of racial discrimination were not applied north of the Zambezi.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 232‚Äì6.Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 110‚Äì14. The danger of Southern Rhodesian rule made demands for African political rights more urgent, and in 1944 James Frederick Sangala promoted the union various local African associations in the protectorate into the Nyasaland African Congress.McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, p. 233. One of its first demands was to have African representation on the Legislative Council, which advised governors on local legislation.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 271, 313‚Äì16. Before 1949, African interests were represented on this council by a single white missionary, but in 1949, three Africans were nominated by the governor to sit on the Legislative Council.Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 101, 192. From 1946, the Nyasaland African Congress received financial and political support from Hastings Banda, then living in Britain. Despite this support, Congress grew at first slowly, until it was reanimated by new Southern Rhodesian proposals for amalgamation and a decrease in membership fees, so by 1953 it had around 5,000 members.McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 235-6. Post-war British governments of both main parties agreed to a federal solution for Central Africa, not the full amalgamation that the Southern Rhodesian government preferred, and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was pushed through in 1953 against very strong African opposition.Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis, pp. 62, 65‚Äì6. The main African objections to the Federation were summed up in a joint memorandum prepared by Hastings Banda for Nyasaland and Harry Nkumbula for Northern Rhodesia in 1951. These were that political domination by the white minority of Southern Rhodesia would prevent greater African political participation and that control by Southern Rhodesian politicians would lead to an extension of racial discrimination and segregation.Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 114‚Äì5. After Federation was imposed, the Nyasaland African Congress promoted a campaign of non-violent resistance. However, the Nyasaland government reacted to the Cholo disturbances of August and September 1953, where the Congress campaign may have been a factor in addition to local land issues, by threatening the President of Congress and forcing him to end it.McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 235-6.Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 135‚Äì6. This lost Congress much of its support and its membership fell to only four or five hundred until the party's revival in 1956.McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, p. 237.Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, p. 137. The Background to the Emergency=Congress radicalised= In 1955, the Colonial Office agreed to the suggestion of the Governor, Geoffrey Colby, that African representation on Nyasaland's Legislative Council should be increased from three to five members, and that the African members should no longer be appointed by the governor, but nominated by Provincial Councils. These councils were largely composed of chiefs but, as their members were receptive to popular wishes, this allowed the Provincial Councils to nominate Congress members to the Legislative Council. In 1956, Henry Chipembere and Kanyama Chiume, two young radical members of Congress, were nominated together with three moderates who broadly supported Congress aims. This success led to a rapid growth in Congress membership in 1956 and 1957.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 341‚Äì2. Between April 1956 and October 1957, a concerted recruitment drive increased party membership from around 1,000 to over 13,000.McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, p. 238. Several of the younger members of the Nyasaland African Congress had little faith in the ability of its leader, T D T Banda, who had only succeeded the veteran Congress leader James Frederick Sangala in January 1957, because of his weak performance when discussing possible constitutional changes with government representative in September and October 1957.Power, (2010). Political culture and nationalism in Malawi, p. 125. They also accused of dishonesty in misappropriating Congress funds, and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda then living in the Gold Coast. Dr Banda announced he would only return if given the presidency of Congress: after this was agreed he returned to Nyasaland in July 1958 and T D T Banda was ousted. Dr Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise quite moderate and far less radical that the younger Congress members.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 344‚Äì5. Although the Nyasaland African Congress was at first based in Blantyre, many branches were established in the Northern Province after 1955. Schemes to prevent cutting down and burning trees to assist the cultivation of finger millet, and to restrict the numbers of cattle owned, had begun in that region in 1938, but from 1947 they were increasingly enforced through fines. From 1951, unpaid work on schemes designed to prevent soil erosion was imposed by the Nyasaland government. Resistance to these measures created a climate of rural radicalism in the Congress branches in the Northern Region, which organised a campaign of sabotaging rural conservation schemes. A wider campaign of demonstrations, many leading to riots, started before a State of Emergency was declared. These intensified after 3 March, particularly in Karonga District, where armed Congress supporters evaded arrest by the small numbers of local police with the active support of the local population.McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, pp. 72‚Äì5, 78‚Äì9. Outside the Northern Province, rural support for Congress was patchy, being strong in the Cholo and Lower Shire districts in the Southern Province and Nkhotakota District in the Central Province but weak elsewhere. In Blantyre and other towns, Congress attracted young, marginalised men ready to participate in demonstrations.McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 238-9. =Banda‚Äôs influence= On his return to Nyasaland, Banda made clear his implacable opposition to Federation, which Welensky's intention, declared in 1957, to reduce British influence in the two northern Federation territories and press for Dominion status for the Federation as early as 1960 made more urgent. Banda also sought self- government rather than immediate independence.Sanger, (1960). Central African Emergency, pp. 195-6, 203. In the nine months between his return and the declaration of a State of Emergency, Banda combined opposition to Federation with more popular causes, such as the African smallholders' dislike of agricultural practices imposed on them to promote soil conservation and also the remnants of thangata. Banda's strategy was to use these popular issues to mobilise Congress supporters into strikes, demonstrations, disobedience and non-violent protests that would disrupt the everyday operation of the colonial government.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 347‚Äì8. Up to late October 1958, the leadership of Congress did not promote or endorse violent action by its members, and was in constitutional discussions with the Nyasaland government that gave some promise of African political advancement. However, when the new Head of Police Special Branch arrived in Nyasaland in September 1958, one of his first tasks was to update a list, originally prepared in June, of those to be arrested if a State of Emergency were declared.Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis, p. 164. The Colonial Office's rejection of Armitage's very limited proposals for reform and, from late October, increasingly aggressive Congress demonstrations directed against Europeans and Asians and intimidation of African opponents increased tensions.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 346‚Äì7. =Increasing unrest= At the end of 1958, Banda and other Congress leader attended an All-African People's Conference in Accra, in recently-independent Ghana and they returned to Nyasaland determined to press for constitutional changeRotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 287 When the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was set up in 1953, provision had been made for the Federal constitution to be reviewed in 1960, including a review of which territories it would include, and Banda wanted to ensure an African, and hopefully NAC, majority on the Legislative Council, one of the bodies which would review Nyasaland's continued membership of the Federation.Baker (2007), The Mechanics of Rebuttal, p. 28. Sir Robert Armitage, who had become governor in April 1956, was not opposed to limited constitutional development, envisaging autonomy for Nyasaland with the Federation, with African majority rule at some future date, but not in the immediate future. His constitutional proposals of October 1958 ignored Banda's demands that Nyasaland's Africans should have adequate representation on the bodies to be involved in the 1960 constitutional talks on the Federation's future. Although Banda was willing to make concessions on a future electoral franchise, he was strongly opposed to proposals that massively over- represented the tiny minority of Europeans and Asians.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 346-7.Sanger, (1960). Central African Emergency, pp. 203, 229-31. Armitage's proposals were for 15 out of 29 seats on the Legislative Council to be filled by officials, with only 14 other members elected under a complex voting system that would probably mean 6 of the 14 elected seats would be filled by Europeans. Murray (2005), Central Africa, Part 2, p. 7. However, Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary rejected any plan for local autonomy for Nyasaland and the proposals for elections to the Legislative Council and, in early January 1959, the Colonial Office made it clear that the protectorate would not be allowed to secede from the Federation nor to proceed toward self-government with an African majority in its legislature for a lengthy period. In consequence, it suggested that Banda and Congress would have to be neutralised to ensure that neither of these eventualities would arise.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 347-8. Murray (2005), Central Africa, Part 2, p. 2. Both the Nyasaland government and Congress were convinced that time was running out. Armitage felt that the protectorate was becoming ungovernable, but Banda saw delay as assisting Welensky to achieve his aim of making Federation permanent and free of British oversight.Sanger, (1960). Central African Emergency, p. 203. In the first days of January 1959, Banda presented the Congress further proposals on constitutional reform to the governor, Armitage. These were for an African majority in the Legislative Council and at least parity with non- Africans in the Executive Council. As this would inevitably lead to a demand for withdrawal from the Federation, the governor refused. When the constitutional talks ended in apparent stalemate early in January 1959, Henry Chipembere and Kanyama Chiume led to demands within Congress for an escalation of anti-government protests and a more aggressive campaign of disobedience. Their programme proposed active disobedience to colonial laws and demonstrations which would lead to arrests, to be followed by protests in favour of those arrested and the arrest of those protestors, and the intimidation of, and sometimes assaults on, police and government workers trying to enforce the laws, in a cycle designed to cause chaos.Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 289. Even after the stalling of his talks with the Nyasaland government, Banda had to decide on whether to try to achieve constitutional advance through the intervention of the British government or by direct and increasingly violent action. Immediately after the talks broke up, Armitage had proposed that Lennox-Boyd should visit Nyasaland, but Lennox-Boyd suggested on 4 February 1959 that Lord Perth, the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs should visit East Africa in early March.Baker (1998), Retreat from Empire, p. 221. However, by mid- February, action by Congress supporters became more violent and statements by its leading activists were increasingly inflammatory so the governor's choices were to carry on with the visit by Lord Perth in the hope that the discussions would help to lower the political temperature, or declare a State of Emergency.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 28 As late as 18 February, Armitage was still hopeful that a meeting between Lord Perth and Banda would go ahead, and noted that the Special Branch report on a murder plot was based on second-hand information, Murphy, (2010). A Police State? p. 769. but he decided against offering concessions soon after, and, after discussions with Roy Welensky the Prime Minister of the Federation, he advised the Colonial Office on 26 February to cancel Lord Perth's visit.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 98-9. Even before this, he made preparations for mass arrests. Armitage first asked for police reinforcements from Northern Rhodesia and Tanganyika, then on 18 February for the battalion of the King's African Rifles based in Northern Rhodesia to be transferred to Nyasaland to strengthen the locally based battalion: this arrived on 26 FebruaryDarwin (1994), The Central African Emergency, 1959, p. 180 After consulting the Federal Prime Minister, Welensky, and Southern Rhodesia Premier, Edgar Whitehead, and with the approval of the Colonial Office, over 1,000 Southern Rhodesian troops were then sent to Nyasaland. These included European troops of the Rhodesia Regiment, the first of which arrived by plane on 27 and 28 February and two companies of the Rhodesia African Rifles.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 105.Baker (1998), Retreat from Empire, p. 223. Both Armitage and Welensky wanted to use white Southern Rhodesian troops in the likely areas of conflict, even if they were barely trained conscripts, while keeping the experienced and professional King's African Rifles and other African soldiers in reserve, as they both feared a mutiny by black soldiers.Ranger, (2009). The 1959 Emergency Conference, p. 2. This was not Armitage's first contact with Emergency powers. He had previously been Governor of Cyprus and had there been discouraged by the Colonial Office from declaring a State of Emergency in response to the EOKA insurrection and campaign of assassination, which broke out in April 1955. Armitage, nervous of loss of control, wanted to \\"nip trouble in the bud\\" there by detaining leading members of EOKA, and he later did so under a Detention of Persons Law without any formal State of Emergency.Simpson, (2002). The Devlin Commission, pp. 20- 1. =The \\"murder plot\\"= In deciding to make widespread arrests, covering almost the whole Congress organisation, Armitage said he was influenced by reports of a secret meeting of Congress leaders (held in Banda's absence) on 25 January 1959, which approved a policy of strikes, retaliation against police violence, sabotage and defiance of the government. One agent code-named Baker, who claimed to have been present, confirmed that a campaign of violence had been discussed, as did a second, who was not present.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 19. These two reports were discussed with the Federal Intelligence and Security Bureau, which prepared a report for the Federal Prime Minister, Welensky, on 10 February. A further report from an African opponent of Banda that Congress planned his assassination and a detailed report by another police informer on 11 February, who claimed that a local Congress chairman had briefed him on the plan for systematic killings on \\"R-day\\", if Banda were arrested, were also made. Murphy, (2010). A Police State? p. 771. These two later pieces of information from informants not present at the meeting, rather than the earlier and less specific reports, were the basis for the claim by the Commissioner of Police that the meeting had planned the indiscriminate killing of Europeans and Asians, and of those Africans opposed to Congress, the so-called \\"murder plot\\". Whatever inflammatory rhetoric may have been used by Congress leaders, there is no evidence that they planned to match their words with actions. However, Banda and his colleagues refused to condemn the violent actions of Congress members, which were increasingly directed toward Africans who failed to support Congress, who the party denounced as \\"stooges\\".McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 349‚Äì51. There is uncertainty about what the Nyasaland and British governments considered was the true extent of the murder plot. The Commissioner of Police reported to the Governor on 18 February McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 350. that: This report also claimed that African \\"quislings\\" would be murdered, Murphy, (2010). A Police State? p. 766. and attached a more detailed report from the Head of Special Branch to the Police Commissioner stating that, in the event of Banda being neutralised, an \\"R-Day\\" was planned for the murder of the governor, senior civil servants, missionaries and other Europeans, and of Asians, including women and children, and that the plan was to be communicated to Congress Party branch chairmen and secretaries throughout Nyasaland.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 19. Armitage forwarded the Commissioner's report to the Colonial office on 19 February, with a covering note referring to a deteriorating security situation, including demonstrations, illegal meetings and minor disorders as part of Congress programme agreed at the meeting of 25 January, but his note made no mention of plans for killing Europeans. Murphy, (2010). A Police State? p. 769. Subsequently, Lennox-Boyd said in the House of Commons on 3 March 1959 that he had seen information which made it clear:Hansard (1959). House of Commons, Vol. 601 Column 290. Julian Amery, the Under- Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, used the words \\"massacre\\" and \\"bloodbath\\" later in the same debateHansard (1959). House of Commons, Vol. 601 Columns. 337, 339. The Special Branch report was forwarded separately to the Colonial Office Intelligence and Security Department (ISD), whose head considered it on 25 February. His assessment was that there was no evidence that Congress had started to act on the more extreme plans reported and that, until 20 February, Banda was still hopeful that a proposed meeting with Lord Perth, the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs would lead to useful constitutional discussions. It was the cancellation of this meeting, according to this assessment, that led Congress to begin an all-out campaign of violent action. The British ISD believed that the information obtained by the Nyasaland Special Branch about plans for violence were broadly accurate, although it recognised that it was the actual violence that Congress members were already engaged in, not any hypothetical murder plot, that provoked Armitage to declare an Emergency. Murphy, (2010). A Police State? pp. 770-1. During the debate House of Commons debate of 3 March 1958, it was claimed by the oppositionthat the allegations of a murder plot were \\"cooked up\\", and Cuthbert Alport, Minister of State at the Commonwealth Relations Office advised on 10 March that more evidence of this plot must be obtained.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 36 An ISD operative visited Nyasaland shortly after the Emergency was declared and, on 31 March, reported that he had a dossier of evidence, some obtained from detainees. The key witness was a Congress member, Thomas Karua, who was present at the meeting as a Congress employee and who had been detained on 3 March. He provided what ISD considered was a detailed and accurate statement, corroborated by other witnesses, Murphy, (2010). A Police State? p. 771. Karua subsequently repudiated his statement and appeared before the Delvin Commission in London.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 140-1 The Nyasaland Police Special Branch in 1959 comprised eight European officers and between 20 and 30 African ones. It was the latter, not the Europeans, who recruited and managed a number of undercover informers; each informer reporting directly and exclusively to a particular African officer, who they owed their loyalty to.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 107. At most, one informant was present at the secret meeting of 25 January 1959; other informants‚Äô reported at second hand, and the Head of the Special Branch reporting to Armitage was four or five removes from anyone that had spoken at the meeting. As the minutes of evidence taken by the Devlin Commission were destroyed for reasons of confidentiality by the Commission's Secretary soon after its Report was published, and not copied to the Colonial Office or Nyasaland government, what details of the supposed \\"murder plot\\" it heard from informants are now unclear.Simpson, (2002). The Devlin Commission, p. 21. However, the disparity between the vague reports of police informers, translations of which were appended to the Commission's Report, and the unqualified assertion of the Commissioner of Police, supported by the report of the Head of Special Branch, of a plot for the indiscriminate killing of all Europeans and Asians has led to speculation that the murder plot was a Special Branch fabrication.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 174, 177-8. The Nyasaland government took no immediate action against Banda or other Congress leaders, and continued to negotiate with them until late February. The governor also made no specific reference to the \\"murder plot\\" until after his declaration of a State of Emergency had failed to restore order quickly. The Devlin Commission later asked whether it would have been better for the government to have published its belief in the murder plot before taking that action, as there was substantial measure of disbelief about the plot when it was publicly mentioned only after the arrests had taken place.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 105, 112-13.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 357. No European or Asian was killed from the date of the secret Congress meeting until the Emergency ended, although there were several opportunities for crowds of Congress supporters to do so, and no reports of serious injuries to European or Asian civilians.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 350. Six non-fatal injuries to members of the security force were recorded during the Emergency, against 149 fatal and non-fatal recorded among insurgents and civilians. French (2016), ‚Äò‚ÄôNasty, not nice‚Äô‚Äô, p. 180. However, Congress intolerance of African support for the Federation or even moderation, both regarded as treachery, had been evident at all levels up to and including Banda. Although this did not lead to killings, there were physical assaults, threats to kill and the destruction of, or damage to, the homes and property of dissenters, and many local Congress branches drew up lists of \\"stooges\\" to be targeted. Although Congress leaders denied to the Commissioners that they planned to massacre Europeans, they did not deny they contemplated aggressive action against Africans who did not supporting their cause or violent resistance to police action.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 351. Armitage did not believe that a coldly calculated plan worked out in detail and in advance by the equivalent of a military staff did exist.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 175. However, he did believe that there might have been some plan for violent action, possibly including the assassination of him and senior European members of the Legislative Council and Civil Service, and that he had to take action to deal with any contingency made possible by the plans that the clandestine Congress bush meeting might have made.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 68.Baker (1998), Retreat from Empire, pp. 218, 226. The Emergency declared=The Nyasaland emergency= After the breakdown of talks in late February, Armitage made preparations for a State of Emergency in Nyasaland, which were approved by the Colonial Office. On 26 February, the Governor of Southern Rhodesia declared a State of Emergency there, the purpose of which was stated to free up troops and police to be sent to Nyasaland. In total, over 1,000 troops were sent to Nyasaland from Southern Rhodesia and others from Northern Rhodesia, including European troops of the Royal Rhodesia Regiment and African troops of both the Rhodesia African Rifles and the Northern Rhodesian Rifles.Baker, (1998). Retreat from Empire, p. 223. On 3 March 1959 Armitage, as governor of Nyasaland, declared a State of Emergency over the whole of the protectorate and arrested Dr. Hastings Banda, its president and other members of its executive committee, as well as over a hundred local party officials. The Nyasaland African Congress was banned the next day. Those arrested were detained without trial, and the total number detained finally rose to over 1,300. Over 2,000 more were imprisoned for offences related to the Emergency, including rioting and criminal damage. The stated aim of these measures was to allow the Nyasaland government to restore law and order after the increasing lawlessness following Dr Banda's return. Rather than calming the situation immediately, 51 Africans were killed between 20 February 1959 and 19 March 1959, 44 men and 4 women by gunfire, and three men by bayonet or baton. Another 79 people were known to have been wounded by bullets, but the total number of injuries was under-reported, as the less seriously wounded, fearing arrest, did not report their injuries. During the punitive operations undertaken during the Emergency large numbers of people were beaten or 'roughed up'.Simpson, (2002). The Devlin Commission, pp. 23‚Äì4.Baker, (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, p. 28. In the debate in the House of Commons on 3 March 1959, the day that the State of Emergency was declared, Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary, stated that it was clear from information received that Congress had planned the widespread murder of Europeans, Asians and moderate Africans, which was the first public mention of a murder plot and, later in the same debate, the Under-Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, Julian Amery, reinforced what Lennox-Boyd had said with talk of a conspiracy of murder and \\"a massacre ... on a Kenyan scale\\".Baker, (1998). Retreat from Empire, pp. 224‚Äì5. During the debate, opposition politicians made allegations in the House of Commons of collusion between the Federal Prime Minister, Welensky and Armitage to arrest Congress supporters in order to preserve the Federation rather than to secure peace and good order in Nyasaland. Although this was denied by the government, Welensky had, in fact, sent advice to Armitage about a possibly declaring an Emergency, and had provided the troops that made declaring it possible.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 95. =Emergency powers= Emergency powers in British colonial territories were based on the 1939 Emergency Powers Order in Council, as amended, or a local equivalent, and the grant of such powers did not require British parliamentary legislation or approval. The Order in Council granted powers to the relevant Governor in Council to proclaim a State of Emergency, and allowed that governor to issue any emergency regulations that appeared to him necessary for securing the public safety, the maintenance of public order and the suppression of rebellion or riots and for maintaining essential supplies and services. Emergency regulations could suspend any law but not set up any court or tribunal to try offenders against the emergency regulations. The emergency regulations issued in Nyasaland in 1959 contained both control provisions and counter-insurgency provisions. The control provisions, which were a normal feature of emergency regulations, allowed for detention without trial, the imposition of collective fines, house searches, restrictions on movement, curfews, compulsory identity cards and censorship, and allowed the security forces to use significant force to disrupt opposition. French (2016), Nasty, not nice, p. 171. Counter-insurgency provisions, which had previously been applied in the Malayan Emergency, Cyprus Emergency and the Mau Mau Uprising, empowered the security forces to engage insurgents by setting-up zones, termed Special Areas in Nyasaland, where lethal force could be used freely and without legal consequences. French (2016), Nasty, not nice, pp. 171-2. The security forces were free to shoot to kill anyone entering these areas without permission who failed to stop when challenged and, of the 47 inquests held on people killed by the security forces in Nyasaland, 45 recorded verdicts of justifiable homicide or accidental death. French, (2011). The British Way in Counter-insurgency pp. 86-7. However, the weakness of the safeguard of requiring a challenge is shown by the example quoted in the House of Commons debate of 28 July, describing the fatal shooting of an African woman carrying a baby in the dawn twilight: she was challenged by a Rhodesian soldier in English, which she did not understand, ran and was shot dead. Hansard (1959). House of Commons, Vol. 610 Column 385. Detention without trial was monitored by an advisory committee which, although chaired by a judge, was not bound by normal legal rules regarding procedure or evidence and was only able to make recommendations to the governor. Detainees were allowed to consult a lawyer before their hearing, but not to be represented at it, or to cross-examine witnesses. Detainees were only given very general indications of the reasons for their detention, and Special Branch police attended hearings to make recommendations, usually against release.French (2011), The British Way in Counter-insurgency, p. 87. As early as 5 March 1959, Armitage was in discussion with the Colonial Office about keeping some or all of the Congress leaders in detention after the State of Emergency was ended and the emergency regulations issued under his emergency powers lapsed. This could have led to challenges under the European Convention on Human Rights, but the Colonial Office considered that suitable legislation could be drafted if a \\"state of public danger\\" existed in circumstances that fell short of those for a full State of Emergency. Murray (2005), Central Africa, Part 2, pp. 25-6. Initially, Lennox-Boyd was doubtful about the political consequences of introducing such legislation and, hoping that the Devlin Commission would recommend the continuance od detention without trial, deferred a decision pending its report.Percox (20o4), Britain, Kenya and the Cold War, p. 87. When the State of Emergency ended on 16 June 1960, the emergency regulations issued under the Governor's emergency powers, including internment without trial would have ended unless the additional measures previously discussed were introduced. As the Nyasaland government was concerned that a small number of detainees would resume violent activities and intimidation, legislation was introduced in May 1960 to extend the detention of several named individuals: all these were released by 27 September.Simpson (2004), Human Rights and the End of Empire, p. 1070. =Operation Sunrise= The arrests were made as part of \\"Operation Sunrise\\", so called because the State of Emergency was declared just after midnight on 3 March and arrest squads were sent out at 4.30 am. By 6 am most principal Congress leaders had been arrested and detained, by 9 pm that day 130 had been arrested but even by 5 March a quarter if those listed for arrest had not been detained. Some were released very quickly, but 72 prominent detainees, including Dr Banda, were flown to Southern Rhodesia later on 3 March: others were detained in Nyasaland. In the course of arresting the detainees, no-one being arrested was killed although five were injured, none seriously. However, in the aftermath of these detentions, 21 people were killed on 3 March when protesting against the detentions.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 40‚Äì2, 48. Of these, 20 were killed at Nkhata Bay, where those detained in the Northern Region were being held prior to being transferred by Lake Steamer to the south. A local Congress leader, who had not been arrested, encouraged a large crowd to gather at the dockside at Nkhata Bay, apparently to secure the release of the detainees. A small detachment of troops had arrived on the vessel, but a larger group which should have arrived in the town early on 3 March were inexplicably delayed. As the handful of soldiers holding back the crowd were in danger of being overwhelmed and the promised reinforcements had not arrived, the District Commissioner felt the situation was out of control, and handed over his powers to the military, who then opened fire.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 115 Subsequent research has shown that, including those that later died of their wounds, the total death toll at Nkhata Bay was 28.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 354. The other death on 3 March was in Blantyre, and there were six more deaths in the Northern Region and five in Machinga District up to 19 March. Most of these deaths occurred when soldiers of the Royal Rhodesia Regiment or Kings African Rifles were ordered to open fire on rioters. The remainder of the 51 officially recorded deaths were in military operations in the Northern Region, termed \\"Operation Crewcut\\".Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 48‚Äì51, 61.Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 299. The District Commissioner based in Nkhata Bay in 1959 was John Brock. He subsequently told the Devlin Commission that he had been advised of the \\"murder plot\\" and, although Brock thought it was only a wild idea,Brock, Personal Account of the Events at Nkhata Bay, p. 14 his actions on 3 March were directed at protecting local European residents in Nkhata Bay. This was the one clear example that rumours of this plot had an effect on events. In fact, the European residents were unmolested throughout the day. Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959,, pp. 41, 115 The failure of the Nyasaland operation to round up all intended detainees quickly, and the deaths and initially widespread disturbances that followed that operation, was in contrast to the efficient Southern Rhodesian operation to detain 400 Southern Rhodesia African National Congress members undertaken shortly before the Nyasaland Emergency. The Southern Rhodesian government relied on the strength of the paramilitary British South Africa Police, backed by European conscripts in the Royal Rhodesia Regiment, to quell any disturbances. The Nyasaland operation demonstrated that the protectorate lacked an efficient security service on the Southern Rhodesian model.Darwin (1994), The Central African Emergency, 1959, p. 228 =Operation Crewcut= Although the initial reaction of many Congress supporters was rioting, damage to government and European property and strikes, within a few days action by the police and troops ensured that the Southern Region became calm but tense and the strikers returned to work. However, in the more remote areas, particularly of the Northern Region, resistance in the form of the destruction of bridges and government buildings and attacks on agricultural conservation schemes, continued for several months, particularly in the Misuku Hills, a remote area of rural Congress radicalism close to the border with Tanganyika Territory.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 355‚Äì6. By October 1958, there were 48 Congress branches in the Northern Region, whose members were the nucleus for a campaign of sabotage that began in that poorly- policed area in mid-February 1959 when constitutional talks broke down and continued until August 1959 when its leader was captured.McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, pp. 72, 75 79-80. This continued resistance was countered by what the governor described as a campaign of harassment, a series of punitive operations undertaken by soldiers rather than police in what were considered \\"disaffected\\" areas, mostly in the north of the protectorate. The operation against armed resistance in the Karonga District was known as \\"Operation Crewcut\\", and the aim of the campaign here and elsewhere was to restore government authority. Suspected members of Congress were arrested and temporarily detained, subject to the governor later ordering long-term detention, or together with other Africans, were charged with criminal offences, either under the emergency regulations or normal laws: a total of 1,040 persons were convicted by the courts and 840 acquitted up to the end of October 1959, when this campaign in the north ceased. In addition, collective fines were imposed on some of these areas under the emergency regulations and, during the operations, homes and property were destroyed and large numbers of Africans were physically abused.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 355‚Äì6.Simpson, (2002), The Devlin Commission, pp. 23-4. The allegations of brutality and wanton destruction made against the security forces were later considered by the Devlin Commission. It rejected claims of rape and torture made against Federation troops during Operation Crewcut, but it upheld complaints of the frequent burning of houses, the imposition of arbitrary fines and bullying behaviour, including beatings with rifle butts or fists, all of which it considered to be illegal and excessive.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 356, 358‚Äì9. The Devlin Commission Within two days of the declaration of the State of Emergency, the British cabinet under Harold Macmillan decided to set up a Commission of Inquiry into the disturbances. Despite strong parliamentary pressure for its members to be involved, the cabinet decided on a \\"limited factual enquiry\\" into the recent disturbances in Nyasaland and the events leading up to them would be carried out by a Commission of Inquiry composed of a judge and three other members. In addition, a wider Royal Commission on the future of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was to be held in 1960, which was the Monckton Commission.Simpson, (2002), The Devlin Commission, pp. 22-4. The four Commissioners were believed to belong to the British Establishment and of a conservative disposition. However, its chairman, Patrick Devlin, was independently-minded and opposed to what he saw as oppression and injustice. His three colleagues had a variety of relevant experience: one was described as the personification of decency and fair play and the two other Commissioners were both experienced and independently- minded.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 80-84.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 357.Simpson, (2002), The Devlin Commission, pp. 27-8 Macmillan did not choose Devlin as chairman, and later criticised his appointment on the basis of his Irish ancestry and Catholic upbringing, and also of supposed professional disappointment. Macmillan and his cabinet colleagues not only broadly rejected the detailed Devlin Report, but engineered the production of the rival Armitage Report, which was prepared very quickly and released on the same day as the Devlin Report.Horne, (2008) Macmillan: The Official Biography, pp. 180‚Äì1.Simpson, (2002), The Devlin Commission, p. 26. The Commissioners arrived in Nyasaland on 11 April 1959 and went about their work in a way that concerned the Nyasaland government. It was apparent that they intended a thorough investigation into the declaration of the State of Emergency and the murder plot, and were unlikely to vindicate the actions of the Nyasaland government, the police and troops.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 356‚Äì8. The British and Nyasaland governments were concerned that Devlin would question the roles of the Federal and Southern Rhodesian governments in influencing Armitage's decision to declare a State of Emergency, but they were generally successful in steering the Commission away from evidence of any plan to eliminate Banda and the NAC in order to preserve the Federation.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 62, 86.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 346-8. The Commission's Report was largely drafted by Devlin who, while in summarising the facts, added inferences to be drawn from them, directing the Secretary of State towards particular conclusions.Simpson, (2002), The Devlin Commission, p. 28. It concentrated on three areas: the State of Emergency, the murder plot and African opposition to Federation. It found that the declaration of an Emergency was necessary to restore order, but criticised instances of the illegal use of force by the police and troops, although rejecting claims of rape and torture by them.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 335-6, 360. Its strongest criticism was over the \\"murder plot\\", which it concluded did not exist as a formed plot, except in the imagination of Special Branch, and condemned using it to justify the Emergency.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 68. Finally, it noted an almost universal rejection of Federation in Nyasaland and suggested the British government should negotiate on the country's constitutional future.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 356, 359.Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 40‚Äì1. The Commission also found that the Nyasaland government's suppression of criticism and of support for Congress justified calling it \\"a police state\\". No colonial government had been so heavily criticised by an official enquiry before this.Darwin, Britain and Decolonisation, p. 250. The Colonial Office obtained a draft of the Commission's report and used it to prepare an attack in parliament. The government claimed that it had the right to accept what was favourable in the Report, such as that the State of Emergency was necessary, and reject the rest.Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 40‚Äì4. The Attorney-General Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller attacked the Repart's use of the expression \\"police state\\" and its rejection of talk about a coherent murder plot: he also claimed that any illegal force used was a regrettable operational necessityBaker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 155.Hansard (1959). House of Commons, Vol. 610 Columns 317-335 The Commissioners felt let down by this reaction, but one anticipated that the Report would soon be vindicated, as it was within a year after Iain MacLeod replaced Lennox-Boyd in October 1959.Simpson, (2002). The Devlin Commission, pp. 50, 51-2. Although their Report was initially discredited, in the longer term it helped to convince the British Government that the Federation was not acceptable to the African majority in Nyasaland.Parkinson, (2007). Bills of Rights and Decolonization, p. 36. The Devlin Report is the only example of a British judge examining whether the actions of a colonial administration in suppressing dissent were appropriate. It was not only a significant incident in British decolonization, but an expression of the values of judicial independence and commitment to the rule of law even in emergency conditions, when they are most under threat.Simpson, (2002). The Devlin Commission, p. 19 Ending the Emergency Armitage had no plans to resolve the political crisis in Nyasaland, other than the elimination of Banda and Congress and, from March 1959, he repeatedly sought Colonial Office approval either to ban Banda from returning to Nyasaland after his detention or to extend his detention (in Rhodesia or Nyasaland) indefinitely, and he was also unwilling to release most of the detainees. The Malawi Congress Party was formed as the successor to the banned Nyasaland African Congress by Orton Chirwa after his release from detention in August 1959 as interim President, although he acknowledged Banda as the party's true leader, a position that Banda assumed on his own release and return to Nyasaland. Those other African politicians that had put themselves forward as moderate alternatives to Banda were, Armitage himself admitted, not credible and without influence. Armitage's hopes of negotiating with Orton Chirwa instead of Banda were dashed when Chirwa said that only Banda had the authority to do so.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 360-3, 367. Armitage was resistant to releasing detainees to reduce their numbers, and his insistence on a detailed review of each case and his statement in July 1959 that he could not envisage releasing a hard core of 49 detainees caused tension with Macleod.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 211 In January 1960, Armitage also asked for extra troops from Southern Rhodesia when Banda was due to be released, a request that Macleod declined to authorise.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959 p. 218. Although Armitage and the Federal and Southern Rhodesian governments were apparently willing to use significant levels of force to keep Nyasaland in the Federation, by the start of 1960, the British government was no longer prepared to do so.Darwin (1994), The Central African Emergency, 1959, p. 232 The Royal Commission on the future of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (the Monckton Commission) toured the Federation in February 1960. It had been given limited terms of reference and was boycotted by the opposition Labour Party and the African nationalists in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. As the Commission's composition seemed weighted towards a continuation of the Federation, its report disappointed the British government. The Monckton Commission reported widespread and sincere opposition to the Federation in the two northern territories. It considered Federation could not survive without at least a major devolution of powers to Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, giving more voting rights to Africans and lessening racial discrimination. Most importantly, it also recommended that Britain should retain the right to allow the secession of either northern territory, recognising that African nationalists would not accept even a modified Federation.Baker, (1997). Nyasaland, 1959: A Police State? pp. 24-5. The British government broadly accepted the Monckton report, signalling a withdrawal of support for the Federation and the acceptance of early majority rule for Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. Accordingly, and despite opposition from Armitage, from the governments of the Federation and Southern Rhodesia, and from some colleagues in the cabinet, Macleod released Banda from detention on 1 April 1960 and immediately began to negotiate with him on Nyasaland's constitutional future. The State of Emergency was lifted on 16 June 1960.Baker, (1997). Nyasaland, 1959: A Police State? Vol. 50, No. 2, pp. 23‚Äì4. Following an overwhelming Malawi Congress Party victory in August 1961 elections, preparations were made for independence, which was achieved on 6 July 1964.McCracken, (2012) A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 367‚Äì9. Even before Macleod's appointment, Lord Perth and Colonial Office officials expressed doubts in October 1959 about Armitage's belief that sufficient moderates could be found to supplant Congress or in his ability to negotiate with Banda, assuming the latter were released. Armitage was informed by Macmillan on 4 January 1960 of the proposal to release Banda in February (this was later deferred to 1 April) in an acrimonious meeting in which he accused Macmillan of being prepared to risk lives in Nyasaland for reasons of political expediency in Britain.McCracken, (2012) A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 363. This was during Macmillan's visit to Blantyre, part of the Prime Minister's six-nation African tour, during which demonstrations were held in Blantyre against the continuation of the Emergency, and a number of British journalists present made allegations of police brutality against what they described as a boisterous but largely peaceful demonstrators.Coffey (2015), Does the Daily Paper rule Britannia, p.157. Several British newspapers called for an impartial inquiry into the police handling of the demonstration, which Armitage opposed. However, Macleod bowed to press and parliamentary pressure and, on 2 February, agreed to a judge-led inquiry, instructing Armitage to arrange it.Coffey (2015), Does the Daily Paper rule Britannia, pp.161, 172 The ensuing Southworth Commission cleared the Nyasaland police of brutality and criticised British correspondents for distorting events. However, the press coverage highlighted to the British public and parliament the strength of African opposition to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the degree of coercion needed to preserve it, and further discredited Armitage.Coffey (2015), Does the Daily Paper rule Britannia, p. 186 Macmillan and Macleod decided not to dismiss Armitage immediately, but in April 1960 they designated Glyn Smallwood Jones as his successor to take over in due course.McCracken, (2012) A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 364. Following Banda's release and the ending of the State of Emergency on 16 June 1960, Armitage, who did not trust Banda, was seen by Macleod as discredited and as an obstacle to constitutional progress.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 248 In August 1960, Macleod advised Armitage to go on leave pending his retirement, and he retired in April 1961 without returning to Nyasaland.Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 265-7. Recent research on the Emergency The Colonial Office was largely successful in concealing from the Devlin Commission evidence that it, Armitage and Welensky wished to eliminate Banda and the NAC to preserve the Federation.Baker (1997), State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 62, 86.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 346-8. Later research has established the degree of interference by the Federal and Southern Rhodesian governments in the declaration of the Nyasaland Emergency. Although it was claimed at the time that the Southern Rhodesian Premier, Whitehead, had proclaimed a State of Emergency there to free up troops to send to Nyasaland in response to the concerns Armitage had expressed in mid- February, it is now clear that Whitehead had been planning to suppress the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress (SRANC) since December 1958, despite little or no evidence that it was acting unlawfully, and that he had Welensky's approval for this action.Darwin (1994), The Central African Emergency, 1959, pp. 226-7 Armitage was only made aware of the planned action against the SRANC at a meeting of Prime Ministers and governors in Salisbury on 20 February, at which the governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson was also put under pressure to act against African anti-Federal parties and declare a State of Emergency in Northern Rhodesia. Benson resisted this pressure, but did place restrictions on 47 Zambian African National Congress activists.Darwin (1994), The Central African Emergency, 1959, pp. 225, 227 Whitehead also wished to take control of security in southern Nyasaland as the price for loaning 900 Southern Rhodesian police to Nyasaland following Armitage's request for police reinforcements: it was an offer Armitage felt obliged to decline.Darwin (1994), The Central African Emergency, 1959, p. 228 Baker, who had served for eight years in the colonial civil service in Nyasaland, made a number of criticisms of the Devlin Commission and Report. Baker's account of the 1959 State of Emergency was criticised by Macmillan as based largely on official documents in government archives and on the papers of, and interviews with, former British and colonial officials, but involved no similar interviews with former Congress members, such that it amounts to a partisan defence Sir Robert Armitage and his officials. Armitage, in Macmillan's opinion, failed in Cyprus and failed again in Nyasaland through a lack of political judgement, including a failure to understand nationalism in either dependency.Macmillan, (1998). Review of \\"State of Emergency: Crisis in Central Africa\\", pp. 583-4. McCracken also considers Armitage had failed to control a political crisis in Cyprus, so was determined not to fail again in Nyasaland, and that, by October 1959, the contempt he expressed for African political aspirations, even in official correspondence, amounted to racial paranoia.McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 352, 361. McCracken also suggests that Baker's underlying aim was to \\"set the record straight\\" by restoring the reputation of Nyasaland's colonial officials of the 1950s and 1960s, while attacking African nationalists and their sympathisers. Like Macmillan, he notes Baker's reliance on official sources, including Special Branch reports, and the recollections of expatriates, and the reduction of African leaders to stereotypes.McCracken, (2003).

The series starred Sarah Lancashire as Trina Lavery, a young woman who returns to her childhood home to look after her terminally ill mother, only to find the man accused of the murder of her best friend several years ago living nearby. The series was directed by Gavin Millar, with Rebecca De Souza acting as producer. The first episode gathered 9.82 million viewers. Episode two dipped slightly; gathering 9.58 million. The series was sold abroad, with both episodes combined into a single film, running at 146 minutes (minus adverts). The series was later released on VHS, exclusively via WHSmith stores. This remains the only home video release to date. Plot Trina Lavery (Sarah Lancashire) returns to her hometown of Stoke-on-Trent after 20 years, there to look after her ailing mother. Upon her arrival, Trina discovers that Bernard Cleve (Lorcan Cranitch), the man who was arrested for the murder of her best friend some years ago, is also living in Stoke, his case having been tossed out of court. Though a free man in the eyes of the law, Bernard is unable to escape suspicion when another local girl is killed. This time around, however, Trina has a feeling that Bernard was not responsible ‚Äì and in setting out to prove her theory, she risks becoming victim number three. Reception The Guardian said of the first episode; \\"Adultery on a bed of sofa cushions, burgeoning teenage sexuality in the woods and a shortage of ice in the home of Trina's alcoholic mum (she took to using frozen peas instead), these are not recognisable traits of cosy Sunday night television.

It was popular in the United Kingdom and Ireland between 1900 and the 1930s. Cine- variety was used to keep stage comedians in work during the early days of silent films and talking films. History From 1900 many of the first purpose-built cinemas had pianos, organs, and occasionally a small orchestra to accompany films. They also employed live acts on stage, along with the silent film. The types of acts that would be employed included comedy routines, acrobats, singers, entertainers and magicians. By the 1930s the cinema showing would usually include a feature film, a B movie, a trailer for the following week‚Äôs show, a newsreel, a cartoon plus a full live stage show. Those in the show were often stars of film, radio, or variety theatre. Most of the cinema chains in the UK and Ireland employed stars for their cine-variety as part of the show. This included stars such as Cicely Courtneidge, Teddy Brown and Tommy Handley from the film Elstree Calling and Clapham and Dwyer, Claude Dampier, Ronald Frankau and Stanelli from the film Radio Parade of 1935. Although cine-variety's heyday was in the 1930s, it continued through the 1950s with the shows at The Empire, Leicester Square, London.

The film stars Dulquer Salmaan, Ritu Varma, Rakshan and Niranjani Ahathian portraying Lead roles, while the later two were making their acting debuts. The film was released on 28 February 2020 along with its dubbed Telugu version Kanulu Kanulanu Dochayante. The film was success at the box office. Loosely based on the American dark comedy television series Imposters.  Plot  Siddharth (Dulquer Salmaan) and Kaliswaran Moorthy (Rakshan) are two youngsters in Chennai who apparently have no family, live alone and spend their time partying with girls. They are shown as freelance techies working from home. Siddharth falls for a door-to-door beautician, Meera (Ritu Varma). He proposes to her and she accepts. Kallis has a crush on Meera's friend, Shreya,(Niranjani Ahathian) , a chef. Meera is revealed to be an orphan brought up in an orphanage and Shreya is revealed to be sent away to fend for herself as her family faces trouble from loan sharks back in her hometown. The guys spend their money and soon realise they are running low. This is when it is shown that they are con artists, who use online shopping scams to earn money. DCP Pratap Chakravarthy (Gautham Menon) begins to investigate their scam when his daughter's laptop explodes. He realizes that the scammers use the addresses of abandoned houses and public WiFi to order electronic products on online platforms and return or re-sell them online after replacing original internal parts with old and duplicate ones. As DCP Pratap tries to track down the culprits, Siddharth changes their plan and now the boys loot expensive items from luxury cars by developing a device that hacks into the locking systems of such cars. Pratap almost closes down on them when the boys steal his friend's laptop from his car and try to sell it, but the boys escape successfully. Meera calls Siddharth and informs him that her handbag was snatched. She cries that though only 3000Rs was stolen, it had been hard- earned money. Siddharth feels guilty and the guys decide to drop the ill- earned way of surviving. They decide to settle in Goa by starting a restaurant with the remaining money from their scams and move to Goa with Meera and Shreya. Pratap tracks down the boys' address only to find the house vacated. He soon follows them to Goa. It is then shown that, though Pratap was investigating the online electronic products scam and the car thefts, this time he had actually begun tracking Meera and Shreya, who are even bigger con artists than Siddharth and Kallis. He informs them that the girls' motive is to make men fall for them, then loot their money. He had initially identified Meera has one of the con artists using a distinctive necklace that had been in the handbag snatched from her, then identified her connection to the guys, following which he had gone to Siddharth and Kallis' former home in Chennai and had eventually traced them to Goa. Siddharth and Kallis find their bag of money missing and are heart-broken to discover that the girls they had truly loved had cheated them. They hitchhike to Chennai with empty pockets and slowly use their 'criminal' minds to find the girls. They figure out that the girls are at Delhi, with Meera in the identity of Ishita, a freelance room arrangement consultant, and confront them. Shocked, the girls return the bag of money and ask them to leave, but Siddharth proposes that they team up and share the amount they steal in the next venture. If the girls fall for them in the process, they will remain together. Otherwise, they plan to share the loot and part ways. It is also revealed that Meera's real name is Madhumitha and Shreya's real name is Varsha, and that both of them were orphans in the same orphanage, who had taken to con artists after being fed up of the deceit in society, especially its men. Madhu and Varsha agree to Siddharth's deal. They decide to target a rich, old businessman, Sooraj Mehta, who eyes Madhu (as Ishita) in mediation class. Varsha also befriends Sooraj's wife in gym. The guys, using their technological brain, slowly break down the security features in Sooraj's car and house. Using a spycam in Madhu's phone and a voice recorder designed as a bracelet, they realize that he is a drug dealer, who has 1 Crore USD in his house, which is equivalent to 71 Crore RS. When the others decide to play safe by dropping the plan, Siddharth convinces them to stay on, and flee overseas after the heist to avoid Sooraj's wrath. They plan to enter the garage in Sooraj's house by using his Rolls-Royce and get his fingerprint to enter the locker room using a 3D printer. As per Siddharth's plan, Varsha is to spend the day shopping with Sooraj's wife and Madhu is to spend time with Sooraj, while the guys loot the money using Sooraj's car. They plan to hijack Sooraj's car while it is parked at the Hyatt Hotel car park, and use it to enter Sooraj's compound, knowing that they will not be seen as the car's windshield and windows are tinted. But there comes a change in their plan when Sooraj drives to his private guesthouse instead of the Hyatt Hotel, to the surprise of Madhu and the others. Shocked, the guys follow the car to a suburban area. Madhu is inside with Sooraj and the guys have only one hour to complete the heist, instead of the two that they had planned for. Siddharth tells Kallis that Sooraj's car is advanced and can be hacked to do many things. He opens an app he had devised and has the car drive itself out of the guesthouse, with some help from Kallis. They then drive to Sooraj's house and safely enter the garage but finds out that to enter through the second security door in the garage, a pattern is required. Siddharth asks Madhu to find out Sooraj's phone pattern and the guys successfully enter the garage. With the 3D printed thumbprint, they enter the locker room, open the locker and steal the money. Madhu fakes a fainting and a nosebleed and the guys return the car to the guesthouse, just in time for Sooraj to rush her and an 'unconscious' Madhu to the hospital. When Sooraj goes in to bring out the doctors, Madhu escapes. Since it would be impossible to take the cash out of the country through an airport without raising suspicion, Siddharth says that they are going to Thailand by road and the pairs set off on their bikes. They encounter Pratap doing vehicle checks at their hotel gate and Siddharth devises a plan quickly. Before the guys leave to confuse Pratap, the girls reveal that they have fallen in love with them. Happily, the guys rush off and tell Pratap that the girls are escaping in a white car. Pratap, following a car that the guys point out, assumes that they are going to the airport. He then assaults a security guard at the airport and breaches the airport security to apprehend the girls, and the guys escape. Siddharth and Kallis call Madhu and tell the girls that they have all the money and that the bags in the bikes are empty. They say that it is their revenge and that the police will reach their location in a few minutes. The girls are left shocked and devastated, and tell themselves that they deserve this for cheating Sid and Kallis in the first place. However, when the Police vehicle enters the hideout, Sid and Kallis get out of the car and say that they were just messing around and that the money really had been in the bags that the girls had. They say that because the girls didn't try to run away but stayed on feeling they deserved this for cheating Sid and Kallis, they think the girls have really started loving them and both couples reconcile and decide to settle down. In Chennai, Pratap is being questioned by the CBI for breaching airport security and for abandoning a high-profile match-fixing case that he had been working in Delhi (for which he had been checking vehicles) to go after two girls who are small-scale cheaters. In a flashback, it is revealed that Pratap was also a victim of Madhu's scams. In a scene mimicking a scene from Gautam Vasudev Menon's romantic film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, he had gifts a rare, expensive necklace to Madhu - the same one that he had used to track her down when her handbag was stolen in the first half of the movie. Too ashamed to declare that he was also a victim, Pratap hangs his head low and it is indicated that he might face a suspension for abandoning his match-fixing case. Back at Sooraj's house, Sooraj watches a CCTV footage of Siddharth and Kallis stealing the money but their face is hidden. The guys have used infrared flashlights on their caps, which have deceived the camera. Sooraj cannot complain to police too as it is illegal money. In the final scene, as they are camping on their way to Thailand, Madhumita sees her name tattooed on Siddarth's forearm and she guiltily says that it's not her name, only to get deceived as Siddarth rubs the ink off saying \\"You think I don't know you?\\" Varsha reveals herself as Thenmozhi and 'Madhumita' asks Sid to guess her name, and all four of them squabble on.

Desingh Periyasamy displays a flair for this material both in his writing and making.\\" S Subhakeerthana of The Indian Express rated the 3.5 out of 5 and wrote that \\"The film rides on clever writing and performances. Some of the funniest moments of Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal are those that involve Dulquer Salmaan and Rakshan. It is a performance-driven film, and the script gives both the actors many moments to shine, tapping into their sharp comic timing.\\" Sify gave 3.5 out of 5 and wrote that \\"Desingh Periyasamy has delivered an enjoyable romantic entertainer with enough brainy moments that keeps you hooked till the end. Though the film is lengthy compared to the current 120 minutes trend, it manages to keep us engaged.\\" Writing for First Post, Sreedhar Pillai gave 3.25 stars out of five and said that \\"Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal looks fresh, and is an enjoyable rom-com or more appropriately, a rip-roaring con ride, mainly owing to its smart writing.\\" Anupama Subramanian for Deccan Chronicle wrote that, \\"Debutant director Desingh Periyasamy's Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal is a synthesis of a rom-com and a modern crime caper, without any pretence or preachiness. So it makes for a fun-filled ride.\\"Behindwoods rated 2.75 out of 5 stars stating \\"Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithal works majorly due to the twists and Dulquer's performance. An interesting Gautham Menon moment in the preclimax acts as an icing on the cake\\". The Hindu stated \\"Director Desingh Periyasamy does a commendable job of putting together a film that lets the script be hero, and keeps you guessing and entertained\\". The New Indian Express stated \\"This film also reminded me of a film like Catch Me If You Can, with a serious cop being in pursuit of some impish criminals who are a step ahead all the time\\". India Today rated 2 out of 5 stars stating \\"Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal is interesting in a few places, thanks to the cat-and-mouse game between the lead characters. If you are willing to look past the superficial elements in the film, there's a nice story lying there on the side\\". Film Companion stated \\"It's how the film interprets Gautham Vasudev Menon's character ‚Äî essentially GVM playing a GVM hero ‚Äî that becomes a gift that keeps giving\\". Deccan Chronicle stated \\"Overall, Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal is a fine outing for a first-timer worth watching\\". The News Minute rated 3.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"What's especially refreshing about 'Kannum Kannum' is that it's not interested in lecturing to the audience\\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote \\"I wish this had been a better movie, though. It needed to be shorter, tighter, far better staged. But most importantly, the twisty plotting needed to be much more convincing in taking us from A to G to K to C. But at a generic level (and sometimes, a bit more), it‚Äôs not bad at all.\\" Superstar Rajinikanth called and appreciated Desingh Periyasamy.  Sequel  In an interview, Dulquer Salmaan told that Desingh Periyasamy planned for the sequel and also narrated the opening 15 minutes to the team.

Country, as an identity or descriptive quality, is the state or character of being rural regardless of environment. It can be at direct odds with quantitative measures of ruralness such as those used by governments for statistical analysis. Country is subjective and often intuitive. It encompasses a broad base of ideas and perceptions that may differ at local, regional or national levels. The term country can be used to refer to individuals both in singular and plural, while the term countryfolk is exclusively used collectively. Social development Identity has the tendency to be more localized within relatively isolated populations. Such populations, having distinct traditions of their own, can often be viewed as an outgroup and marginalized by the dominant culture. Accordingly, contrast between rural and urban realities not only produces measurable differences politically and economically, but also affects populations in terms of social identification. Country conceptualization shifts the focus away from the prevailing forces in society (usually centered in larger, metropolitan regions) and towards those on the periphery of society (remote areas and small towns). Consequently, this transition causes rural populations to feel less ignored, better connected with rural diaspora and significantly more empowered. By extension this transition highlights that rural culture is pervasive and does not necessarily depend on residing in a rural area. As a result country conceptualization often assists in reversing negative psychological consequences of frequent marginalization. \\"The Town Mouse and Country Mouse\\" of Aesop's Fables an early parable of urban and rural equality/divide. Cognitive definitions Country is a subjective state that perceives the rural experience as focal and inseparable to ones identity, regardless of location. This is often expressed in the demarginalization of ideas, values or lifestyles held as being representative of such a character. A concise understanding of Country as an overarching concept is difficult due to the tendency by observers to equate it with frequently associated elements. As well, by individuals and groups denoting Country with classification that limits in such terms (IE \\"rural working-class culture\\" or \\"southern culture\\"). However, country conceptualization is perhaps best epitomized not in objective elements, as place, class or environment, but rather in its subjective symbolism and in the perception that individuals can continue to retain a sense of ruralness even in urbanized areas. As there is no definitive, scholarly consensus on precisely what constitutes as Country, much of its discourse can be attributed to the artistic community who describe it in romanticized ways. In her master thesis, Manifestations of Collective Identity in Country Music - Cultural, Regional, National, Stephanie Sch√§fer denotes that country music is important tool for reinforcing this collective identity. Despite Sch√§fer's analysis of country music as losing much of its \\"ground\\" in recent years through commercialization, even modern songs such as How Country Feels (Randy Houser), A Little More Country Than That (Easton Corbin), I'm Country (Craig Morgan), She's Country (Jason Aldean), etc. continue to, directly or indirectly, address the topic of Country conceptualization. For example, Luke Bryan in What Country Is illustrates Country by contrasting it with what it is not. He elaborates that: This emphasis of non-material culture over material resonates with the rural experience as being represented through material elements rather than solely consisting of them. Within the United States country frequently transcends a close relationship with the Culture of the Southern United States as a source of unity and empowerment of local, marginalized peoples who feel left out from the dominant culture. The preference to identify as country before more tradition means of classification, such as race or class, is reflected of self-determination theory. As human beings have an inherent drive to better their association with others they consistently try to do so more effectively. Country identification is one way in that an individual strives for this realization by identifying in ways that are more advantageous to rural populations and not necessarily in ways dictated by mainstream society.

Although De'VIA works have been created throughout history, the term was first defined and recognized as an art genre in 1989. In 1989, a group of nine Deaf artists gathered at Gallaudet University shortly before the Deaf Way arts festival was being held there. Led by Betty G. Miller, known as the Mother of De'VIA, and Paul Johnston, these artists created a manifesto detailing what De'VIA is and what it includes. Since its official designation as a genre, De'VIA has helped to introduce the Deaf experience to the artistic world and give a new platform to the Deaf community.  De'VIA Criteria  The De'VIA Manifesto, an original copy of which can be found in the De'VIA Curriculum, outlines the major criteria of De'VIA works. According to the manifesto and its signatories, De'VIA work is: *representative of Deaf experiences *uses specific artistic strategies such as color contrast and centralized focus *generally within the field of visual fine arts and alternative media *not exclusive to Deaf artists and not inclusive of all Deaf artists A major point of De'VIA is its differentiation from Deaf Art. Deaf Art is a term encompassing all artists who are Deaf, while De'VIA art can be made by Deaf and hearing individuals, as long as it represents the Deaf experience and perspective. A hearing CODA (Child of deaf adult), for example, could be a contributor to De'VIA. Similarly, a Deaf artist does not necessarily belong to the De'VIA genre if their work does not use defined formal art elements common to De'VIA, such as contrastive colors and exaggerated facial features, to portray the Deaf experience.  De'VIA Manifesto Signatories  Betty G. Miller and Paul Johnston held a workshop titled \\"Expression: American Deaf Art,\\" which took place at Gallaudet University in May 1989. Attendees spent four days discussing the experiences and elements of Deaf art. At the culmination of this workshop and their discussions, they created a written manifesto to coin the term De'VIA and detail its characteristics. The following list contains the artists that participated in this workshop and signed the manifesto: * Betty G. Miller, painter * Paul Johnston, sculptor * Deborah M. Sonnenstrahl, art historian * Chuck Baird, painter * Guy Wonder, sculptor * Alex Wilhite, painter * Sandi Inches Vasnick, fiber artist * Nancy Creighton, fiber artist * Lai-Yok Ho, video artist  De'VIA Categories  Thematically, De'VIA consists of two basic categories; Resistance De'VIA and Affirmation De'VIA. =Resistance De'VIA= This branch of De'VIA includes artworks that showcase themes of audism, oralism, mainstreaming, cochlear implants, identity confusion, and eugenics. All of these themes, typically negative in the eyes of the artist, are brought forward as a form of protest, as resistance De'VIA conveys how Deaf people have been oppressed, colonized and marginalized. =Affirmation De'VIA= In contrast to resistance De'Via, affirmation De'VIA demonstrates themes of empowerment, ASL, affiliation, acculturation, acceptance, and Deafhood. Affirmation De'VIA highlights the positives by expressing the joy and empowerment within Deaf culture and the attributes of Deaf Gain that Deaf people share. These themes are used to express the Deaf experience in a poignant way, showing the powerful platform and perspective that the Deaf community holds.  De'VIA Motifs  As in many art movements, there are common symbols (or motifs) repeatedly used among different De'VIA artists in their works. Some common motifs in De'VIA works include: *Eyes *Hands *Ears *Mouth *Children *Doors *Musical instruments *Animals These motifs can be analyzed in different ways throughout the pieces in which they appear, however the four most prevalent motifs are the eyes, the hands, the ears, and the mouth. In most cases, these symbols are used to communicate a message concerning the communication of Deaf people among each other or in interactions within the hearing world. = Eyes = Some notable De'VIA pieces highlight the eyes by either scratching them out or switching them with other parts of the face. This can either showcase the artist's feelings of being ignored by hearing people or emphasize the importance of the eyes in ASL. = Hands = Since the hands are the primary source of ASL, many artists use them in their art. Chuck Baird notably uses hands in his artwork to show how certain signs visually represent their meaning. Hands in chains or shackles can also represent the artist's struggles with being prohibited from signing in school or at home.Durr, P. (1999), Deconstructing the Forced Assimilation of Deaf People via De'VIA Resistance and Affirmation Art. Visual Anthropology Review, 15: 47-68. doi:10.1525/var.2000.15.2.47  Notable De'VIA works = \\"Ameslan Prohibited\\" = This illustration by Betty G. Miller, which can be viewed here, is an example of resistance De'VIA. Ameslan is an old acronym for American Sign Language, which references the first few letters of each word: Ame(rican) S(ign) Lan(guage). The title references the act of not allowing Deaf people to sign. Through the shackling of hands, it conveys the message that denying Deaf people access to signed languages is harmful, represented by the broken fingers. By portraying that Deaf people are injured by disuse or banning from signed languages, Miller's work expresses some of the common resistance De'VIA themes like oralism, mainstreaming, and oppression. = \\"Family Dog\\" = Susan Dupor's painting \\"Family Dog\\" is also a resistance De'VIA work that visually likens the Deaf child to the family pet. Seen here, the comparison stems from the Deaf child's inability to communicate with their family due to their lack of access to language. Because of that lack of access, the child is treated like an animal which has limited communication. Dupor's piece has been found provocative by many of its viewers, and protests the hearing approaches used by hearing parents of deaf children, and therefore falls under resistance De'VIA. = \\"Whale\\" = This painting by Chuck Baird, one of De'VIA's most notable contributors, serves as an example of affirmation De'VIA. The painting incorporates the sign for whale into a beautiful seascape, where a whale would be naturally found. This juxtaposition shows the iconicity of American Sign Language and subscribes to affirmation De'VIA themes such as ASL, empowerment, and Deaf gain. = \\"Oralist Child Abuse\\" = Nancy Rourke's image shows children in an oralist setting signing the letters A(merican) S(ign) L(anguage) behind their backs. Speech class and other oralism programs are a common theme in many Deaf experiences. This image provides an example of resistance De'VIA as it showcases a protest of oralism. The title references an experience that many members of the Deaf community have lived through, an experience of language deprivation which many liken to child abuse.

He has been the object of attacks by some Catholics for interviewing Vladimir Luxuria who, on that occasion, recounted his conversion to Catholicism.

When developing interactive games designed for children aged from 1 to 6, Protey, as art director, was concerned with the development of perception of shape, colour and sound. In a year, Fox & Sheep, a German mobile application publisher, announced their acquisition of Bubl Studio At present, Protey Temen is a regular participant in art expositions, professional discussions and multi-format festivals in Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Russia, USA, Great Britain and continental Europe. Temen defines his current art practice using two key terms: ‚Äúabstract identity‚Äù and ‚Äúroutine spectacularity‚Äù. Works by Protey Temen are held by the collections of the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, the Russian State Library, Komnata (The Room) gallery, and in private collections in Russia, Germany, France and Spain. He was a participant in the Venice Biennial 2011 (Internet pavilion), the European Biennial of Modern Art Manifesta 10, and the international biennial of digital art The Wrong. Protey Temen graphics \\"Stones, Hairs\\", 2016  Works  The artist describes the surrounding world with the language of abstract graphics. Since his early childhood, Protey has developed a particular, well- recognized style which he has realized in his work both as an art director or illustrator, and in his strictly personal work. = Dobrotarism = The movement of Dobrotarism appeared in 2007, founded on the basis of the simplification of an image on a geometrical level, bright, contrasting colours and ostentatious joy. The basic goal of the artist during this period was the study of the models and structures of daily life. This resulted in the exhibition ‚ÄúIconography of Dobrotarism‚Äù, held in the ‚ÄúDom‚Äù (The House) cultural centre in 2007. From 2008 to 2009, within his ‚ÄúPost-Dobrotarism‚Äù cycle, Protey delved even deeper into abstract imaging, still remaining within the confines of his initial graphic language. ‚ÄúMy work is about ritual, about the soul, about a kind of pure thing. And a number of symbols which I constantly used ‚Äî masks, images, costumes ‚Äî they are also about this pure thing. A text and an emotional experience would stand behind each picture. I came to this realisation just a short time ago, but it was true earlier too. That same Dobrotarism is mixed up in religion, in the basics of Russian icon- painting. In fact, I became drawn into the idea of identity. And what does identity mean? It is a system of signs and symbols‚Äù. Sheet from the series \\"Atlas. The first part \\", ink, watercolor paper, 30x42 cm. = The monochrome cycle = In 2010 the monochrome period of his work began, which featured a break from the full colour palette, beginning to describe the surrounding world via independent abstract systems. By 2013 the final abandonment of colour and semi-tones occurred. The approach that arose was also applied by Protey to alternative media: to sculpture, to video-shots, to 3D monochrome textures. The basic theme of the period was the study of an object as a body, a line, a black spot: ‚ÄúThe spot was one of the basic images which I used earlier; and even now it attracts me for many reasons: in one case it can disguise extra items in an image, concealing their essence; in another case it becomes a silhouette and almost a sign, it is both the shadow of a man and a hole in the universe‚Äù. = Surritualism = In 2014, Protey formulated Surritualism as a new method. It is based on two inseparable parts: ritual, and the principle of surrealism to denude the absurdity of this or that action. In 2015 Temen decided not to use computer technologies in his works. His basic focus in 2016 was the representation of information and the practice of visual communication. Many images were inspired by book graphics inside scientific literature, including texts devoted to biology. The artist elaborated a system of image analysis based on a toolkit of frequently used representation models. Works of 2015-2016 are the beginning of the Inner School of Open Studies. These works unite images representing ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù, using popular educational guides, explanations on table-napkins and other presentational practices of exact and sensory sciences. ‚ÄúVia the plastic multiplication of these layers, Protey Temen fixes such routine processes as consideration, memory and thinking‚Äù. = Inner School of Open Studies = In 2017 Protey opened the Inner School of Open Studies, where he is both a teacher and a student. He is creating a series of textbooks and atlases within his school and gives lectures, in particular, the spring cycle of lectures at –ú–ú–û–ú–ê. ‚ÄúThe core theme Protey Temen is now working with ‚Äî that is, researching the environment, analyzing it and fixing it with the plastic language of abstract art and graphics ‚Äî has remained unchanged for many years, yet the artist‚Äôs aesthetics have obviously changed. From the pagan territory of myth and the method of surritualism developed by him, Protey approaches, step by step, a quasi-scientific way of interpreting the world. How does the gaze work, what is information, what are objects made of, why do we see a spot and perceive a symbol in a definite way, how do we influence what is occurring around us, acting as witnesses to various processes? Everything that can be conventionally laid into the sphere of sensory, reflexive personal experience, facts that cannot be checked, are codified and converted into common, popular knowledge by Protey. Gradually proving his hypotheses, he explains his own intuitive discoveries about the structure of the world, using the approach and vocabulary of a rationalist scientist. Nevertheless, the artist remains within the field of art: packing these pieces of knowledge into customary formats used by enlightenment institutions (texts, illustrative materials, graphs, visual aids) he returns the aesthetic focus to theory‚Äôs dry language. The scientific style of learning about reality usually implies the abandonment of the aesthetic component in favour of understanding the meaning of something. Protey combines the emotional experience of ‚Äúthe beautiful‚Äù and the search for ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù, unites the abstract and the concrete, manifests to us as spectators and students of his ‚Äúinner school‚Äù the similarity between the fundamental strategies of the scientific approach and art practices aimed at the revelation of the only true and faithful version of reality‚Äù. ‚Äî Julya Yousma  Selected solo exhibitions  ;2017 :Exhibition in the Apartment #68, Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building, Moscow, Russia :Having Coffee, Making Calculations, First Person exhibition / Magazijn, Amsterdam Art Weekend, Amsterdam, Netherlands :Knowledge Of (with Lucas Gutierrez), Aperto Raum, Berlin, Germany :Processes and interactions, –ú—É–∑–µ–π –ê—Ä—Ç4, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ ;2016 :One Ant Climbed Into Astronaut‚Äôs Ear, Moscow Architectural Institute, Moscow, Russia ;2015 :Untitled Corridor (with Vadim Gershman), Lazy Susan Gallery, New York, USA ;2014 :The Gift, Komnata Gallery, Moscow, Russia :Live Collective Art Project, Summer Music Program, Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow, Russia :The Cave of Generosity, Komnata Gallery, MMOMA, Moscow, Russia ;2013 :Wall, Poster Stars, New Holland, St. Petersburg, Russia :Don‚Äôt Cross the Line when Dancing on the Seashore, Emzin, NLB Gallery Avla, Lyublyana, Slovenia ;2012 :Video Texture, Textura Festival, Scene Molot, Perm, Russia :Fragile and About Music, Exhibition, ‚ÄúManhattan‚Äù Business Center, Ekaterinburg, Russia :Soon Wave, Opening, Polyteatr by Eduard Boyakov, Moscow, Russia :Screensaver, Stoned Boys, Solyanka Club, Moscow, Russia :I am Eating when Bored, Gruppa Krovi, 180m¬≤ Gallery, Moscow, Russia ;2011 :Every Day Is The Same, Exhibition, Demetra Art Hotel, St. Petersburg, Russia :Passion the Movie, Rojo Nova, Cinemateka de Brasiliera, Sao Paulo, Brazil :Mechanics Logotype, Media Pole, Gallery LVS, Seoul, Korea ;2010 :Oil Project, Gruppa Krovi, Annexe Gallery, Bordeaux, France :Dollars & Rozes, Gruppa Krovi, Permian Economic Forum, Perm, Russia :Easter Egg, Easter, Street, St. Petersburg, Russia ;2009 :New Year Action, Gruppa Krovi, Tretyakovskaya metro, Moscow, Russia :Dollars & Rozes, Gruppa Krovi, Expo Center and Streets, Novosibirsk, Russia :Last Show, Gruppa Krovi, Flacon Design Factory, Moscow, Russia :Dollars & Rozes, Gruppa Krovi, Winzavod, Moscow, Russia :Shaders, Exhibition, Open Studio, Berlin, Germany :Breakfast Heroes, Pictopia, Open Studio, Berlin, Germany ;2008 :Advertisement Magazine, Un Sedicesimo Magazine, Edizioni Corraini, Mantova, Italy :Ovaloromb, Videoperformance, Solyanka Club, Moscow, Russia ;2007 :Dobrotarism Icons, Exhibition, Dom Club, Moscow, Russia  Selected group exhibitions  Knowledge Of, Chapter B, The Quickest Via pavilion, The Wrong biennale, World Wide Web, 2017 Processes and Interactions, Art4 Museum, Moscow, Russia, 2016‚Äì2017 Various Works Selection, META ‚Äì The Wrong New Digital Art Biennale, 180 Creative Camp, Abrantes, Portugal, 2014 Newspaper, L‚Äô√âcole europ√©enne sup√©rieure d‚Äôart de Bretagne, Rennes, France, 2013 Passion the Movie.

HMG was invented during World War II by the company's founder, Herbert Falder. Today it is broadly used, including by the British Museum and the York Archaeological Trust. In 1997, HMG was used to adhere pieces of the Anglo-Saxon Pioneer helmet, which was found broken into between 100 and 200 fragments. Particularly fragile areas had their cracks injected with a solution of HMG diluted 50% with acetone, to consolidate them and prevent them from collapsing; holes made while cleaning away corrosion were likewise injected with pigmented HMG. Stronger areas, such as the sinister cheek guard, found in eighteen pieces, and the nasal, were joined directly with the adhesive. Finally, HMG was also used to adhere glass fibre matting on the inside of the helmet, strengthening weak joins and covering gaps, the latter to provide backing against which gapfill could be applied. Technical properties HMG is advertised with a flash point, and a temperature resistance. It is insoluble in water and soluble in acetone, and is composed of 70% amyl acetate solvent, 25% cellulose nitrate, approximately 5% of the plasticizer dibutyl phthalate, and a small amount of a phenolic resin leveling agent.

Biography Clara Estella Zeiss was born on March 20, 1867, in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of Carl Zeiss and Helen E. Dreyer (1840‚Äì1907). Mrs. C. W. Trowbridge was the first State president of the International Sunshine Society, and Baumhoff acted as treasurer and secretary, also superintendent of junior work. This State Branch was organized in 1902. The International Sunshine Society was founded in 1896, in New York, with eighteen members, by Cynthia Westover Alden. In 1914 the membership numbers over 300,000, and extended to all parts of the world. Of the original members who supported and assisted the Sunshine Sewing School, only the following were living in 1914: Mrs. Wm. E. Warren (who was Mrs. F. M. Biebinger), Mrs. John Conrath, Mrs. W. H. Sturgess, Lola V. Hays, Marcella Keys-Hanaford, Mrs. Jos. Maloney, and Mrs. J. C. Woodson. Baumhoff became the honorary president, while Marcella Keys-Hanaford was the president. The Sunshine Society accomplished a wonderful amount of good in places where the regularly organized charitable associations could not readily reach. They were always quick to respond to appeals for assistance, taking methods for placing the sick and afflicted in immediate touch with the best care and attention from physicians, placing them in hospitals, and rendering any assistance that may be needed in any direction, ranging from temporary relief from poverty to long treatments for clironic cases of disease of body and mind. While the work was general, yet in 1914 Baumhoff's special plan was to reach, through her Missouri Division, all the people possible by the press, pulpit, free lectures ‚Äî which she gave by traveling all through the State ‚Äî correspondence and sending out of literature on the subject, on the prevention of blindness, and to give those already blind opportunities of education to enable them to become self-respecting and independent. She wanted to awaken an interest throughout the State in the care, maintenance and training of dependent Wind children, before presenting the Blind Babies' Bill to the next Legislature. In her lectures, she proposed to use the deaf, dumb and blind deserted child ‚Äî who already had all these advantages to demonstrate the possibilities of and necessity for such care. Baumhoff resigned as State president of the Missouri Branch, that she could devote all her time to the interest of the blind children of Missouri, and in honor of her long and faithful service to the State organization was unanimously elected honorary president of the Missouri Division for life. Besides the care of blind children, the society maintained a baby ward in the Children's Home Society of Missouri. Much convalescent work was also done, wheelchairs were provided where needed, and social service work of the city was always greatly assisted by the Sunshine Society of St. Louis. Baumhoff also gave, during 1914, a series of lectures to young women to help them look out for themselves, and eliminate, as far as possible, the foundation of trouble, illness, or wrong, caused by the words, \\"I did not know.\\" The following Sunshine Memorials, most of which were studied, financed, and gotten into good order by Baumhoff, before presenting to the State Sunshine for adoption, were: Winter of 1901‚Äì1902, maintained the Sunshine Sewing School at Seventh and Gratiot Streets, thereby aiding 200 poor children and their parents; closely followed by furnishing a room in the Sunshine Convalescent Home in the Mountains of Hendersonville, N. C; room in the New Blind Girls' Home (St. Louis); two cribs in the Brooklyn Blind Babies' Home; Sunshine Baby Ward in the Missouri Cliildren's Home (St. Louis), with eighteen memorial cribs; aided three Sunshine Scholarships; maintained a crib in the St. Louis Children's Hospital for five years; gave twenty-one libraries to isolated towns and institutions; loan of ten wheelchairs to shut-ins unable to buy or rent one; assisted, placed and supported eighteen refined old folks, many of them four-score years; cheering the shut-ins and four-score members; helped and saved young girls from temptation and vice. Before adopting Baumhoff's seven-year studied plan of intelligent mothering, care and training of blind children under school age in their own homes, as far as it is deemed advisable, it was considered wisest to protect all of the Sunshine interests by incorporating the Missouri Division, International Sunshine Society, which was accomplished January 25, 1912. It was hoped by using this plan for blind children to preserve the little children's individuality by mothering, and at less expense, and to make no efforts to establish a blind babies' home until absolutely necessary. This society had no indebtedness, no paid officers or solicitors. It did more practical humanitarian work with a limited treasury and established more paid-up memorials than any other society of its size and kind. The local work owed much of its success to the Press and the hearty co- operation with other social agencies, which avoided duplication of work, waste of time and expense. The International Sunshine Society did more for blind babies in a comparatively few years of its existence, than a century has otherwise seen done for this class of service. The \\"light hunger\\" of a blind child retards its growth and progress mentally, physically morally and spiritually. If it was not intelligently assisted to develop its mind, and thus given its birthright to become as sweet, lovable, bright and progressive as the sighted child, it would take later more time, patience, love, individual attention and mothering to help the blind child than a normal one. Clara Estelle Baumhoff was a charter member of the Papyrus Club, Twinkler's Club (both writers' clubs); was a member of the Mother's Circle of the Shenandoah School, as well as of various educational and philanthropical organizations. She contributed many short stories for children, valuable social service articles to leading magazines, and published her novel, That Awful Brother, full of humor and pathos, embodying much of her sunshine activities. She married Frederick W. Baumhoff, postmaster of St. Louis, and had three sons, Eugene, Frederick William Baumhoff, Jr (1893‚Äì1958) and Herbert, all serving during World War I. During World War I she was interested in war relief work and was one of the first women in St. Louis to assume an active part to aid the American soldiers in France. She lived at 3501 Victor Street, St. Louis, and died on March 27, 1919. She is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis.

Background On 2 July following a Viet Cong (VC) mortar and sapper attack on Da Nang Air Base that destroyed three aircraft and damaged a further three, the United States Marine Corps tactical area of responsibility was extended south of the base to a line south of the Cau Do River. This area had been a stronghold of the Vietminh during the French Indochina War and remained a VC stronghold. On 12 July, units of the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines operating around Cam Ne received fire from a VC force coming from the hamlet of Cam Ne 4 (numbered in order to identify it in the complex of six villages of the same name). Patrolling in the area continued during July and into August. Commonplace military procedure for US forces when villages or areas were generally uncooperative or hostile were to burn down the villages and rounding up civilians for deportation to refugee camps in urban areas or RVN-controlled areas. On 3 August 1965, Company D, 1/9 Marines was sent to Cam Ne in support of Operation Blastout with orders to destroy the VC forces and their fortifications, including any structures from which they received fire. As the Marines moved into Cam Ne they were met with sporadic fire, wounding one Marine, but the VC withdrew. The entire village was extensively entrenched and fortified and the Marines found 267 Punji stick traps, 3 grenade booby traps and 6 anti-personnel mines. The Marines then proceeded to destroy 51 huts and 38 trenches, tunnels and fighting positions. With dusk approaching the Marines began to withdraw and again came under fire from the VC, the Marines then called in an artillery and mortar barrage and four 105mm shells and 21 81mm mortar rounds hit the VC positions. =The CBS Report= CBS news correspondent Morley Safer was in Da Nang to report on Marine activities. On 3 August Safer joined the Marines headed for Cam Ne. Safer was accompanied by a South Vietnamese cameraman, Ha Tue Can. The operation at Cam Ne was filmed by Can and narrated by Safer. The film showed a Marine, armed with a rifle, lighting a hut with his cigarette lighter. No opposition was evident. According to Safer's report the Marines were under orders to burn to the ground any hamlet from which they received even a single burst of sniper fire. Old men and women who were pleading for the Marines to spare their houses were ignored. The houses and personal belongings were burned. Pleas from the villagers to delay while their possessions were removed were ignored. All rice stores were burned. The day's operation netted four prisoners, all of whom were old men. CBS realized they had an important and powerful story as soon as it was received in New York. CBS News President Fred Friendly confirmed the validity of the story with Safer. The images were shocking, but the network felt the story was important and should be shown. The incident was broadcast on CBS Evening News on August 5, 1965. Reaction to the Cam Ne report was immediate and powerful. CBS was inundated with calls and letters critical of this negative portrayal of American military personnel. The day after the film was broadcast, U. S. President Lyndon Johnson telephoned CBS President Frank Stanton to complain the report insulted the American flag. The President ordered a background investigation on Safer, certain he was working for the Communists. No such affiliation was found. LBJ next ordered an investigation of the Marine officer in charge of the Cam Ne operation, certain Safer must have bribed the Marine to burn Cam Ne. Nothing came of this either. The Pentagon asked CBS to replace Safer as Vietnam correspondent. The Department of Defense began monitoring the evening television newscasts. Safer followed up his initial report with additional broadcasts critical of Marine operations in the area. The commander of the Marines in Vietnam, Major General Lew Walt, banned Safer from all of I Corps, the Marine Corps area of responsibility in South Vietnam (the order was later rescinded). In the days that followed, the U.S. media carried additional stories of the impact of Marine operations on South Vietnamese civilians around Da Nang. =The Marine Corps perspective= The huts were burned to ensure they would not be reused by VC forces after the Americans moved on. The Viet Cong force estimated to be between 30 and 100 strong had fired upon the Marines as they withdrew from the village. Four Marines were wounded and one Vietnamese child were killed in the fighting. No enemy bodies were found; the Marines assumed they carried off their dead. The Marines used great force on August 3 at Cam Ne because they expected it to be occupied by Viet Cong soldiers. They had taken casualties there the previous month. They felt the CBS report was distorted and were critical of CBS for telling only part of the story.Marine Corps Gazette, Vol.49, No. 10, October 1965, p. 29. On 9 August, another Marine unit operating near Cam Ne came under enemy fire: two Marines were killed and more than twenty were wounded. The Marines decided to complete the job of securing the area. On 18 August the Marines returned in force, but this time, the villagers were given full warning. In addition to searching Cam Ne, the Marines built shelters for Vietnamese civilians. The entire village was cleared. No VC were found in Cam Ne and there were no casualties.  Conclusion  Although American military commanders considered Safer's report both distorted and incomplete, they were not unresponsive to it.< They realized killing civilians and destruction of village property had serious consequences in a struggle where winning hearts and minds was an essential component of military victory. Over a year later during two Operation County Fair a joint US-ARVN sweep of the village complex (not necessarily the same village as Cam Ne refers to a set of six villages) on 17 March 1966, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines claiming to have killed 2 VC in the village and captured a suspected VC nurse and held 13 others for questioning and found two ARVN deserters. In order to balance its initial, critical reports, subsequent CBS reports presented positive aspects of Marine operations in the Cam Ne area. COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland ordered the preparation of new guidelines concerning contact between U.S. military forces and Vietnamese civilians. Published in September 1968 nearly 3 years after the event, the rules forbade indiscriminate destruction of populated areas . When possible, villagers were to receive advance warning of upcoming assaults. South Vietnamese troops would accompany the American forces to assist in searching dwellings and communicating with civilians. Although the Pentagon considered censoring American journalists reporting from Vietnam, the plans were never adopted.

It was founded to serve the rapidly growing market for electrical power transmission and for telegraph and telephone cables. It grew into a massive industrial empire with factories in many French cities and abroad. In 1962 it merged with the Compagnie fran√ßaise des m√©taux and became Tr√©fim√©taux. In 1967 Tr√©fim√©taux was acquired by Pechiney. The various plants were closed or sold over the years. Founder The company was created by Lazare Weiller (1858‚Äì1928), who was born in the small town of S√©lestat in Alsace on 20 July 1858. He studied in Angoul√™me and Paris, and then in Trinity College, Oxford. He returned to Angoul√™me to work in his cousin's factory, which produced metal sheets for the paper industry. He became interested in the problem of drawing copper wires, for which there was growing demand, adapted the process of rolling hot steel rods into wire so the method could be used with copper and launched his own company in Angoul√™me to make copper wire in this way. He developed a bronze alloy that combined the conductivity of copper with the strength to remain stretched between poles apart, of great value to telegraph and telephone companies, and obtained several patents in France and other countries. In 1880 at the age of 22 Weiller created what would become the Tr√©fileries et Laminoirs du Havre. Weiller joined the board of the Soci√©t√© des t√©l√©phones, which was both a customer and an investor in his company. Weiller remained interested in research and explored transmission of images over electrical wires, colour photography and flying. He was elected a deputy in 1914, and held office through World War I, then was a senator from 1920 until his death in 1928. Early years Atelier de tr√©filerie Lazare Weiller 1892 Lazare Weiller in 1920 Weiller created the Soci√©t√© Lazare Weiller in 1883, with the first factory in Angoul√™me, and was the main owner of the enterprise. The company was incorporated on 7 July 1883. Weiller acquired land along the Paris‚ÄìLe Havre railway and the new Canal de Tancarville in 1895, and in 1896 built a larger factory at Graville(fr) in the Le Havre region. The choice of location was to take advantage of Le Havre as a port of entry for copper and a port from which to export products to England and the United States. In 1898 the Le Havre factory had 14 steam engines with 8,300 horsepower and 114 electric machines. The factory avoided employing great numbers of workers, but in 1897 had 900 employees, rising to almost 2,000 in 1913. It covered about of which half was roofed. It included forges, foundries, rolling mills and wireworks and processed copper, steel, aluminum, brass, bronze and nickel. The bulk of the output was for electrical equipment and construction of telephone and telegraph lines. In 1901 the company became the Compagnie des Tr√©fileries et Laminoirs du Havre (TLH). Weiller became associated with Swiss banks, and from 1907 started to acquire facilities and companies to become a huge industrial complex. The company, now a soci√©t√© anonyme, increased market share through purchase of the Soci√©t√© coop√©rative des fonderies, laminoirs et tr√©fileries de Rugles in 1907. In 1911 TLH further increased its production of electrical wires and cables by merging with the Canalisation √©lectrique company, giving it a dominant position in the industry, reducing competition and opening new markets in Paris streetcars, the PTT and other ministries, railways and so on. Eug√®ne √âtienne was appointed to the TLH board in 1911, left this position when he became Minister of War in January 1913, then rejoined the board the next year and became president until his death in 1921. √âtienne was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1881 to 1919. He was leader of the Colonial group in the chamber of deputies, and agitated for expansion of railway lines in the colonies. He felt that the future of TLH lay in developing the railways and ports of the colonial empire. Etienne was linked to Robert Pinot of the Comit√© des forges. In 1913 the company's assets were 57,800,000 francs, making it the 22nd largest industrial company in France, and the third largest manufacturer of electrical equipment after the Compagnie Francaise Thomson-Houston and Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Electricit√©. Members of the board of TLH were also involved in many other companies, helping the growth of the enterprise. Examples were Henri Cahen, director of the Soci√©t√© des applications industrielles; Alphonse Hauser, retired chief engineer of the navy and administrator of the Compagnie des ports de Tunis, Sousse et Sfax; Raymond Jarry, administrator of the Soci√©t√© des hauts fourneaux de la Chiers; Gaston de La Mathe, administrator of the Soci√©t√© √âclairage √©lectrique and Soci√©t√© √ânergie du nord de la France; and Ren√© Robard, an engineer also on the board of Alluminio italiano. Hippolyte Bouchayer, √âmile Cahen, Henri Cahen, Raymond Jarry and Ren√© Robard were all members of the board of TLH and of its Italian subsidiary Le Trafilerie e laminatoi di metalli, which produced copper wire and steel and copper pipe for the Italian market, particularly the Italian armed forces. World War I  During World War I of 2,700 employees at Le Harve, 2,200 were enlisted in the army, the factory was placed under military control and engaged in production of war material. Women and children were employed in large numbers, as were refugees from Belgium and the occupied parts of France. The number of worker rose to 6,800 at Le Havre and 1,300 at Rugles. In the spring of 1917 five workers were dismissed for circulating a petition that objected to downgrading the classification of some jobs and demanded a cost of living allowance. During this period Louis Loucheur, administrator of TLH, became Minister of Armaments. The company bought several cargo ships, which were armed in Bordeaux. In the summer of 1914 TLH took control of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de couleurs m√©talliques et de l'aluminium lamin√©. TLH tried but failed to acquire the Soci√©t√© √©lectrom√©tallurgique fran√ßaise de Froges, the largest French producer of aluminum. TLH did manage to acquire a large stake in the Soci√©t√© d'Alais et de la Camargue, an aluminum producer. This company in turn took control of the Soci√©t√© √©lectrom√©tallurgique de Froges in 1919 to become the Compagnie des produits chimiques et √©lectrom√©tallurgiques d'Alais, Froges et Camargue (Pechiney). Hippolyte Bouchayer represented TLH in Pechiney. Although TLH did not gained as large a share of aluminum as they wanted in France, the company expanded its interests in this metal in Norway and Italy. Later history The plant in La Havre after World War II Another view of the post- war plant The company later moved its headquarters to Paris and came to have factories in Le Havre, Rugles, Saint-Maurice, Grenoble, Charleval, la Praz, Dijon, Montreuil-Belfroy, Darn√©tal, Saint-Denis, La Courneuve, Poissy and Pont-de-Ch√©ruy. Eug√®ne Maucl√®re (1857‚Äì1933), former controller-general of the army and councilor of state, a member of the board of the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e and vice-president of the Mokta-el-Hadid and Phosphates de Gafsa mining companies, joined the board of TLH as president in 1931. In 1932 TLH was the largest manufacturers of copper, lead, zinc, tin and metal products in Le Havre, which now received 60% of copper imports into France thanks to its connections with North America. The plant made wire, tubes and sheets of copper and steel which were then shipped to the mechanical construction and electrical industries. A quarter of output went to the colonies. As of 1939 TLH employed 4.673 workers in Le Havre. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) in the period between 1940 and 1944 TLH had to deal with a shortage of copper, and made more use of aluminum and aluminum alloys. From 1943 Henri Lafond was President of the Mines du Huaron and on the board of Tr√©fileries et Laminoirs du Havre. A 1952 study said Trefileries et Laminoirs du Havre had a capital of 3,132 million francs and holdings in Hauts Fourneaux de la Chiers, Alais-Froges, Financiere Metallurgique Electrique, Lignes Telegraphiques et Telephoniques, Etablissements Bouchery, Signaux et Entreprises Electriques, Etablissements Coquillard and the Societe Procol. TLH was also part-owner of Pechiney. Merger and subsequent changes In 1962 TLH merged with the Compagnie fran√ßaise des m√©taux and became Tr√©fim√©taux. In 1966 the wire drawing and steel cabling operations of Plant 2 were taken over by the Soci√©t√© des hauts fourneaux de Chiers-Ch√¢tillon, which opened a casting and rolling mill to manufacture small aluminum alloy cables in 1968. In 1969 Chiers-Ch√¢tillon merged with Cousin fr√®res to form the Soci√©t√© Seine et Lys, which closed in 1972, laying off 425 people. Many of those who lost their jobs were women. In 1967 Tr√©fim√©taux was acquired by Pechiney and became the copper division of that group, contributing 8% of the group's total. In 1971 Pechiney merged with Ugine Kuhlmann to form Pechiney Ugine Kuhlman (PUK). From 1974 PUK suffered serious losses. The threat of mass dismissals was first aired in 1974. Between 1980 and 1987 the Tr√©fim√©taux subsidiary reduced staff from 6,000 to 2,500 and closed the factories in Le Havre and Dives sur Mer. In 1980 it sold its cable production activities to Pirelli. The Tr√©fim√©taux copper mill in Le Havre closed in 1980, and in 1981 Tr√©fim√©taux closed its remaining operations in Le Havre. It was succeeded by three companies: Cuivres et Alliages; Chiers, Ch√¢tillon Gorcy (which later became Hauts Fourneaux de la Chiers and then Technor); and Thomson Cables. Cuivres et Alliages was closed in 1984.

Early life Garrett was born Clare Pfeifer on July 26, 1882, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Carl Pfeifer, a prominent engineer, who took an important part in the erection of the Eads Bridge. When she was ten years old her father died at the age of forty. Both her parents were German-born, and came from Germany as children, the mother, Marie Rotteck, in 1848, and the father several years later. Her brother, H. J. Pfeifer, followed in his father's footsteps, was the engineer, maintenance of way, of the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis. She studied in St. Louis and then went to Paris and New York. She attended the public schools of St. Louis and later was a pupil of Sacred Heart Convent. In 1906, while in London, she married Edmund A. Garrett, an artist and inventor. They had two sons, Carl and Julian, who were often models for their mother. St. Louis 1890‚Äì1902 At the age of eighteen she first attended classes at the art school in the old museum on Locust Street, where Robert P. Bringhurst was her first and the most efficient and painstaking instructor she ever had. Garrett related that she did nothing serious for the first year; she played and wasted her time, and it was not until the closing week of the term that she thought of her work other than as a diversion and a lark. Her lack of concentration annoyed Bringhurst and be became discouraged with her. \\"You had better give it up. You have no ability,\\" he told her. \\"I have ability\\" she cried. \\"I will do this thing,\\" pointing to a difficult model, \\"and I will finish it, too.\\" This thoroughly aroused her slumbering energy and ambition. Her interest in her work became absorbing and she won scholarships as well as their first medal. Studying at the St. Louis School of Arts from 1893 to 1897, she won scholarships, and in 1897 its prize medal. From that time until 1902 she maintained her own studio in St. Louis, where she became busy with her first commissions, and a number of large pieces, among them the already referred - to bust of President McKinley, in the McKinley High School, a fifty-foot frieze of children in the Eugene Field School (1901), and a memorial bas- relief at the Mary Institute. According to Mary Powell in Public Art in St. Louis, the Eugene Field School frieze was still in place in 1925, but currently the piece is lost. For two years after finishing the course she lived an altogether social life, but tiring of it, finally fell back on her art, which occupied time that had come to lag heavily, and gave her an opportunity to express the latent talent she had allowed to lie dormant. The development of her art and the acquirement of an aim in life date from this period. Her first studio in St. Louis was in the Y. M. C. A. Building‚Äîfor one year. And the first commission was from Mr. Ittner, the architect, for the frieze in the Eugene Field kindergarten. She lived at 4128 Botanical Avenue, St. Louis. Kingsbury Place In St. Louis three of Garrett's large pieces could be seen at the Mary Institute, the Eugene Field School and McKinley High School. A fourth, posed by a St. Louis girl and named Carrie Kingsbury or Awakening of Spring (1902), stands still today at the entrance of Kingsbury Place adorning the Union Boulevard gateway. The Kingsbury piece took two years of work to Garrett and once unveiled, the sensual nudity of the girl caused such an uproar that Garrett used the $7000 ($ in dollars) compensation to move to Paris. A number of smaller pieces were in many of St. Louis' finest homes. She was splendidly remunerated, busts bringing her $1,000 ($ in dollars), and other pieces in proportion. Awakening of Spring by Clara Pfeifer Garrett She acted as assistant to Bringhurst for several years, while studying in the art school, and spent some time in Omaha, assisting him in work on the pediment of the Art Building, under construction for the Fair. This included decorating cornices. Often she would work on scaffolding twelve feet high. Here an interesting incident took place. Garrett preferred modeling children wherever the opportunity presents itself, and made a number of very good nudes of little cherubs which were put on the cornices. One night, soon after, the Salvation Army women chopped them down with axes. They were heavily fined and obliged to pay for them. Their artistic point of view evidently did not coincide with that of the artist. This brought a great deal of notoriety at the time to both Bringhurst and his assistant. Paris 1902‚Äì1904 In 1902 Garrett was able to realize the cherished ambition of every aspiring artist, to study in Paris, where she entered L'Ecole des Beaux Arts, under Marquette and Merci√©. This was the great French school, and was the greatest of art and architecture in the world. Afterwards, she left there for more advanced work, the study of her own models in her own studio. Emile Bourdelle, the French sculptor, renowned for great subtlety in his work, she chose as her critic. For the first year he came weekly, afterward only as Garrett sent for him. For each criticism his fee was 50 francs ($10) ($ in dollars), from which we learn that not only is art long and life short, but that it is expensive, too. Her work was exhibited in the Salon, Champs Elysees, Paris, 1903‚Äì05, the three years she resided abroad. Les Crysalides was exhibited in the Royal Academy, London, 1904, and again at the 101st Annual Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1906 hosted by the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts. Always in 1904 she was awarded a bronze medal by the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, held in St. Louis in 1904, for Echo, a bronze in the nude. New York 1905‚Äì1915 Clara Pfeifer Garrett A portrait in low-relief (bas-relief) of her husband was exhibited by the National Sculpture Society, New York, in 1905, and by it awarded honorable mention. Until her return from the East to St. Louis she was a regular exhibitor at the National Academy, and at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In New York she lived first at 15 E. 59th St, New York City, and later at 993 E. 150th St., New York City. In 1906 her Boy Teasing a Turtle, a fountain figure exhibited in Paris at the Salon of 1903 and at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, in 1904, was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It was purchased by Sir Caspar Purdon Clarke , the director of the museum, from the Gorham Company, Fifth Avenue, New York, through whom Garrett sold her smaller pieces exclusively. Always in 1906 she exhibited 3 pieces at the National Academy of Design 81st exhibition held at 215 West 57th Street, New York City: Lorette, Mrs. B. and her daughter, Madame C. et sa fille. In 1907 she exhibited three pieces at the Boston Art Club fine arts exhibition: Statuette of a Little Girl, The Naiade (statuette) and Portrait in Relief. In 1908 she exhibited one piece, My son, at the National Academy of Design during their 83rd Annual Exhibition. Her husband had a collection of platinum-print photographs of his wife's many pieces of work, pieces that were sold and scattered from New York to California. Among them, not already mentioned, was one which carried a strong appeal, Budding Womanhood, owned by David Belasco; a medallion portrait relief of Mrs. Hudson E. Bridge, and a life-size group of a French lady with her young daughter. Another was The Peasant Boy, which she sold to Gorham & Co., silversmiths. The Boy Piper and Sleep were figures in the Strauss photograph gallery in St. Louis. A model for a clock, which attracted much attention, was made for Mrs. James Blair. St. Louis 1915‚Äì1929 Clara Pfeiffer Garrett, Mother and Daughter In 1915 she obtained the sculpture prize of the Artists' Guild of St. Louis and in 1916 the St. Louis Art League prize of $500 ($ in dollars) with the sculpture Mother and Daughter. In 1915 Dr. Frank J. Lutz retired. He built up the St. Louis Medical Library later Library of the St. Louis Medical Society. In recognition of this service the society accepted a life-size bronze medallion of Dr. Lutz presented by members of the society in 1916. The members subscribed a minimum of one dollar each. They collected $163. Clara Pfeifer Garrett offered to make the medallion for $150. The model was completed on February 14, 1915, and accepted by the committee. It was then sent to New York and cast in bronze by the Gorham Company. On its return to St. Louis Garrett asked the privilege of entering the medallion in competition in the second annual Open Competitive Exhibition of the St. Louis Artists Guild. The Committee, with the consent of Dr. Lutz, granted the request and the tablet won the first prize in sculpture, the Susan Rebecca Carleton prize of $100. In the Bulletin of the St. Louis Art League, Vol. 11, No. 2, is a photograph of the tablet and in a review of the exhibition: \\"Mrs. Garrett in her tablet to Dr. Frank J. Lutz shows praiseworthy capacity to carry a serious sculptural work through to completion in a thoroughly workmanlike manner.\\" Beverly Hills 1929‚Äì1941 From 1929 to 1941 Garrett lived in Beverly Hills, California. Later life and death She died on May 15, 1946, in New York City.

Hall and Louis Louaillier were American political figures who were ordered detained during the War of 1812 under the order of Major General Andrew Jackson in 1815. Hall later put Jackson under investigation and oversaw the trial that led to Jackson being fined.  Background  Upon entering New Orleans in December 1814, Major General Andrew Jackson declared martial law to establish control of the city to defend it from British forces. It was the first such declaration in United States history.  Louisiana Courier article by Louis Louaillier  On March 3, 1815, Louisiana State Senator Louis Louaillier wrote an anonymous article in the Louisiana Courier criticizing Andrew Jackson's declaration of martial law and his refusal to release the militia after the British ceded the field of battle. Two days after the article appeared, Louaillier admitted to writing the article, and Jackson ordered Louaillier's arrest. U.S. District Court Judge Dominic A. Hall signed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Louaillier, and Jackson subsequently ordered Hall's arrest as well. Jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrests of Louaillier, Hall, and John Dick (a lawyer) and after intervention of State Judge Joshua Lewis. Lewis was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia, and also signed a separate writ of habeas corpus against Jackson, his commanding officer, seeking Judge Hall's release. Jackson proceeded with a court-martial of Louaillier. Louaillier was later exonerated, but Jackson did not release him from jail. Jackson then released Hall and escorted him beyond the city limits, outside the zone of martial law. Jackson told Hall not to return until the war had officially ended. Just two days later, Jackson received official word of the Treaty of Ghent and immediately lifted martial law and released all prisoners.  Trial and fine of Andrew Jackson  Hall later ordered an investigation of Jackson's actions in New Orleans, and Jackson was brought before the court, overseen by Hall, and was subsequently fined $1,000 for contempt of court, which he paid in full. Jackson's fine was later paid back to him by Congress, with interest, in 1844, to around $2,700.

In 1994, the Chicago Tribune said they were \\"among the top country groups of Eastern Europe and Russia\\". That same year, they performed their bluegrass-influenced music before the genre's founder, Bill Monroe, at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. As of 2013, they were the only Eastern European group to play at the Opry. Their repertoire includes a mix of music, from Russian folk to American bluegrass, to country- rock, rock-and-roll and blues. The band toured the United States six times from 1991 to 1994. They have performed country and bluegrass-influenced music longer than any other Russian group, with a total of 15 albums over 30 years, 3 in the United States and 12 more in Russia. The band is still active, but with a different lineup of performers than they had in the mid-1980s and 1990s when they rose to international prominence. In 2010 they played at the Montreux Jazz Festival. The band's name –ö—É–∫—É—Ä—É–∑–ê is the Russian word for popcorn. Years after the founding, the story of taking the name has been lost, as different members remember different things. The name wasn't meant to imply corny or funny, however. It was a serious name that implied that the band had many flavors, just as corn has many flavors, depending upon where it is grown. Beginnings The band began as a student \\"collective\\". In 1975, students Sergei Senchilo (acoustic guitar) and Czech student Vladimir Ambros (harmonica) got together to play songs of United States, England, and Scotland. By the next year, they had attracted others, and were calling the group Ornament. Ornament lasted until about 1983. Beginning in 1984, some of its members continued to play together under the new name Kukuruza. They began their interest in western music before the end of the Cold War. Their early adaptation of western music in the years before perestroika was difficult and dangerous, because western music was suspect (possibly illegal) in the Soviet Union. Facing bans for playing \\"music of the ideological enemy,\\" they pursued their musical interests in the mid-1980s, attending music festivals and recording their first album, We Sing in English, which was not one of their bluegrass albums. The Soviet Union gradually loosened official resistance to western music and some western bands were able to tour. After seeing performances by Roy Clark (who visited Russia in 1976 and 1988) and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (who toured Russia in 1977), the students who would become Ornament and Kukuruza looked for music that they could access to learn from. They learned the bluegrass style by listening to Czech bands, and to American performances through banned Voice of America shortwave radio broadcasts and black-market second-hand records. Bluegrass has specific instruments, some of which were rare in Russia. Others were present, but not played in the bluegrass style there. They chose western instruments and taught themselves to use them, dobro, banjo, mandolin, fiddle and guitar, as well as electric guitar. Not being in the United States, they didn't have the bluegrass community's artistic pressure to conform to use only acoustic instruments. They adapted electric guitar into their mix, perhaps led by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, whom they had seen in concert, who also used electric guitar in some of their music. Learning the style on their own, they successfully blended it with Russian music. They began a process of fusing east and west. Songs such as John Hartford's 1971 progressive bluegrass \\"Vamp in the Middle\\" were translated and adapted, using bluegrass instruments to create the sound but blending with Russian vocals. Similarly they applied western instruments (electric guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle) to a Russian jazz work, Leonid Utesov's \\"The Old Cabby's Song\\". Russian folk songs were adapted too, and one of the band, Andrei Shepelev, proved to be a songwriter as well. He was credited as writing or adapting many of their pieces on the albums made in the United States. When the 1998 record, Endless Journey was released, the president at Gadfly Records, Mitch Cantor, commented on the group's style. He said that he didn't think of them as a bluegrass band, but a group with a \\"unique juxtaposition of styles,\\" able to switch between Russian traditional, jazz and bluegrass styles of music, yet still maintain their own sound. United States tours The band made tours to the United States in the early 1990s. During the release of their second record made in the United States, Crossing Borders, they performed at the Grand Ole Opry, and were on the television show Nashville Now. They were given the opportunities to work with county music performers Emmylou Harris, Doc Watson and Jerry Douglas, the latter of whom performed on their Crossing Borders album.

The Blocknot consisted of fifty sheets of 5-figure random additive, 100 additive groups to a sheet. No sheet was used more than once, thus the blocknots were in effect a form of One-time pad. The Soviet Unions highest grade ciphers that were used in the East, were the 5-figure codebook enciphered with the Blocknot book, and were generally considered unbreakable.I-19ab, p.17 Technical Description Blocknots were distributed centrally from an office in Moscow. Every Blocknot contained 5-figure groups in a number of sheets, for the enciphering of 5-figure messages. The encipherment was effected by applying additives taken from the pad, of which 50-100 5-figure groups appeared. Each pad had a 5-figure number and each sheet had a 2-figure number running consecutively. There were 5 different types of Blocknots, in two different categoriesVol 4 p. 105 *The Individual in which each table of random numbers was used only once. *The General in which each page of the Blocknot was valid for one day. The security of the additive sequence rested on the choice of different starting points for each message. In 5-figure messages, the blocknot was one of the first 10 Groups in the message. Its position changed at long intervals, but was always easy to re-identify.I-19b, p. 16 The Russians differentiated between three types of blocks: # The 3-block, DRIERBLOCK. I-block for Individual Block: 50 pages, additive read off in one direction only. The messages could be used and read only between 2 wireless telegraphy stations on one net. # The 6-block, SECHSERBLOCK. Z-block for Circular Block: 30 pages, additive read off in either direction. The messages could be used and read, between all W/T stations in a net. # The 2-block, ZWEIERBLOCK. OS-block. Used only in traffic from lower to higher formations. Two other types were used, in lower echelons. # Notblock: Used in an emergency. # Blocknot used for passing on traffic.I-190 p.9 The distribution of Blocknots was carried out centrally from Moscow to Army Groups then to Armies. The Army was responsible for their distribution throughout the lower levels of the army down to company level. Independent units took their cipher material with them. Occasionally the same blocknot was distributed to two units on different parts of the front, which enabled Depth to be established. Records of all Blocknots used were kept in Berlin and when a repeat was noticed a BLOCKNOT ANGEBOT message was sent out to all German Signals units, to indicate that it may have been possible to break the code using it. There was no certainty in this.I-19c p. 10 Corporal Althans, a cryptanalyst with the General der Nachrichtenaufkl√§rung stated while being interrogated by TICOM: :It seems that depths of up to 8 were established at the beginning of the Russian Campaign but that no 5-figure code was broken after May 1943 German cryptanalysts who were prisoners of war stated under interrogation, that each of the figures 0 to 9 were placed en clair usually within the first ten groups of the text or sometimes at the end. One indicator was the Blocknot number and the consisted of two random figures, the figure representing the type, and the remaining two, the page of the Blocknot being used.I-19c p. 13 In long messages, 000000 was placed in the message when the end of a page had been reached. Chi number The Chi-number was the serial numbering of all 5-figure messages passing through the hands of the Cipher Officer, starting on the first of January and ending on thirty-first December of the current year. It always appeared as the last group in an intercepted message, e.g. 00001 on the 1st January, or when the unit was newly set up. The progression of Chi-numbers was carefully observed and recorded in the form of a graph. A Russian corps had about 10 5-figure messages per day, and Army about 20-30 and a Front about 60-100. After only a relatively short time, the individual curves separated sharply and the type of formation could be recognized by the height of the Chi-number alone. Monitoring Blocknots were tracked in a card index, that was maintained by the Signal Intelligence Evaluation Centre (NAAS). The NAAS functionality included evaluation and traffic analysis, cryptanalysis, collation and dissemination of intelligence. The card index, which was one amongst several Card Indexes. A careful recording and study of blocks provided the positive clues in the identification and tracking of formations using 5-figure ciphers. The index was subdivided into two files:I-19b, p. 16 #Search card index, contained all blocknots and chi-numbers whether or not they were known. #Unit card index, contained only known Block and Chi-numbers. Inspector Berger, who was the chief cryptanalyst of NAAS 1 stated that the two files formed: :The most important and surest instruments for identifying Russian radio nets, known to him. The Blocknots were also used in the Stationary Intercept Company (Feste), the military unit that were designed to work at a lower level to the NAAS, at the Army level and were semi-motorized, and closer to the front. The Feste used the Blocknot value along with several other parameters to build a network diagram. The network diagram was studied extensively, as part of a 6-stage process, that involved several departments within the Feste. The final outcome was a metric which dermined the most interesting circuit for traffic monitoring, and least interesting, were monitoring of traffic should cease. Analysis Johannes Marquart was a mathematician and cryptanalyst who initially worked for Inspectorate 7/VI and later led Referat Ia of Group IV of the General der Nachrichtenaufkl√§rung. Marquart was assigned the study of the Soviet Union Blocknot traffic. Marquart and his unit conducted extensive research in an attempt to discover the method by which they were produced. All the counts which they made, however, failed to reveal any non-random characteristics in the design of the tables, and while they thought the Blocknots must have been generated by machine, they were never able to draw any concrete deductions as a result of their research. Example The Soviet 3rd Guard Tank Army transmits a 5-figure message with the Blocknot of 37581 (one of the first 10 groups in the message). On the same day the Block 37582 was used by the same formation. The next day 37583 appeared. Thereafter, for a period, the Army was not heard by German Wireless telegraphy intercept operators, as it was maintaining wireless silence. After a few days, an unidentified net with the Blocknot 37588 is picked up. This message net is claimed, because of the proximity of the blocks (88/83) to be the 3rd Guard Tank Army. The missing Blocknots 84-87 were presumably used in telegraphic, telephonic or courier communications. The Chi number provides confirmation of the first assumption, based on proximity of blocknots in most cases.

Retrieved 29 January 2018. With the end of the Second World War, employment opportunities for women (which had been substantially expanded to meet wartime demands) contracted; the social expectations that women would become full-time mothers once they had children also acted as a cultural barrier to employment. In the late 1940s, Judith Hubback became aware of her mother-in-law, Eva Hubback's, social studies on working-class housewives and took an interest in replies to her surveys.Helen McCarthy, \\"Social Science and Married Women's Employment in Post-War Britain\\", Past and Present, vol. 233, no. 1 (2016), p. 280. She became increasingly interested in women's attitudes towards work and self-funded her own postal surveys as part of a project to explore the lives of highly educated, married women in Britain. She published the results of her surveys in 1954 as a pamphlet, Graduate Wives, which attracted coverage in national newspapers. She followed it up in 1957 with a much more substantial book: Wives Who Went to College, described by The Guardian as \\"considerably ahead of its time\\". In the words of the historian Helen McCarthy, Hubback was one of a number of researchers in the 1950s (such as Viola Klein, Pearl Jephcott, Ferdynand Zweig, Nancy Seear and Hannah Gavron) who \\"helped to entrench new understandings of married women‚Äôs employment as a fundamental feature of advanced industrial societies, and one that solved the dilemmas of ‚Äòmodern‚Äô woman across social classes.\\"McCarthy, p. 270. She reported the frustrations of highly qualified women who felt constrained to stop working once they married or to care for their children; she concluded that women who sacrificed themselves and their capacity for self-actualisation to become full-time mothers and wives instead were \\"often too self-sacrificing in the sense that they let themselves drift into a state of mind in which their daily lives gradually destroy them as individuals\\".Judith Hubback, Wives Who Went to College (1957), pp. 150‚Äì1, cited in McCarthy, p. 284. Hubback argued that women could balance motherhood, marriage and work only through the full support of their husbands.Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska (ed.), Women in Twentieth-Century Britain: Social, Cultural and Political Change (Longman, 2001), p. 126.

His works spanned a range of media including watercolors, oils and acrylics, lithographs, and sculptures. His subjects included landscapes, horse and sailboat races, urban and industrial scenes, burlesque and ballet dancers, nudes, still life, and narrative works. He was born in Chicago, Illinois and graduated with a B.A. from the Art Institute of Chicago where he studied under the post-impressionist master Louis Ritman. Upon graduation in 1943 he won the prestigious Joseph Ryerson Traveling Fellowship. In 1946 he married Yvonne Fillis, a singer and dancer whom he met while she was a student at the Goodman School of Drama. Pen was an instructor at the Art Institute of Chicago, serving on its faculty from 1948 until 1963. His long association with the Institute included service as President of the Alumni Association and Director of Oxbow, the Art Institute's summer school of painting (1964-1965). He travelled widely in Europe, North Africa, the Caribbean, and South America each summer to paint; in 1958 he received a Huntington Hartford Foundation Grant that enabled him to paint while in residence at Hartford's Pacific Palisades, CA artists' retreat. Pen resigned from the Art Institute faculty in order to develop his private studio, where he taught from 1965‚Äî1989. During the politically turbulent 1960s Pen was employed as a court artist to document trials because cameras were not permitted in the courtroom. Pen's work has been exhibited in numerous galleries, including Carroll Carstairs Gallery, (NYC), The Joseph Welna Gallery, The Frank Oehlschlaeger Gallery, and currently at the Richard Norton Gallery (Chicago). Paintings may be seen in public collections at The National Gallery of Art, The Library of Congress, The Vincent Price/Sears Collection, and the Art Institute of Chicago as well as in private collections throughout America.

His work explores the way in which things move within unusual (often trapezoidal) shapes. Pen believed that our eyes rarely look at anything steadily and directly. His work leads the viewer beyond the confinement of the \\"square.\\" Most importantly, Pen felt that innovation is the key to art. He is documented as the first artist to advocate shaped canvases. Pen's distinctive style, in both its strength and beauty, takes bold strokes beyond Impressionism to Futurism.

It was presented to Parliament on 1 February 2018 by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.  Premise  The 2018 budget was considered to be a crucial one, as it would be the first since the rollout of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime in India. It was widely expected that the budget would either increase the exemption limit, or introduce a standard deduction for salaried people to reduce the tax burden, in addition to a reduction of the tax rate for the ‚Äì slab from 20% to 10%, and an increase in the 30% band above . The budget also came on the heels of a cut in the corporate tax rate in the United States. Printing of the budget began on 20 January 2018 with the traditional Halwa ceremony. Significant announcements The budget contained a number of significant announcements. It included a healthcare programme called the National Health Protection Scheme (Ayushman Bharat) to cover 10 crore (100 million) poor families. The Government proposed to contribute 12% to the Employees' Provident Fund for new employees for three years. It was proposed that the medical allowance and transportation allowance be replaced by a standard deduction of for salaried employees. The allocation to the Ministry of Defence was , with to be spent on the day-to-day running of the armed forces, and on modernisation, with the rest being allocated for pensions. There was no reduction in personal income tax rates, and the Cess on income tax was to be increased from 3% to 4%. A 10% tax on long-term capital gains (LTCG) was reintroduced after a 14-year absence. The Corporate tax was reduced from 30% to 25% for companies with turnover up to . Customs duties were increased for various products. A special scheme to tackle air pollution in Delhi was also introduced. The salaries of Members of Parliament were doubled and their total emoluments are likely to go up from Rs 1.4 lakh to Rs 2.3 lakh per month. Further, the salaries will be increased every five years. Reactions Reaction to the budget was mixed-to-positive. = Political = Political reaction to the budget was mixed. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Prime Minister, Narendra Modi said that the budget is \\"development- friendly,\\" focused on the needs of the rural areas and will strengthen the vision of a \\"new-India\\". The Congress leader, former prime minister and noted economist Manmohan Singh suggested that the arithmetic behind the budget was \\"faulty\\". The general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)), Sitaram Yechury said the budget was \\"unconnected to ground realities\\". Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Sri.N.Chandra Babu Naidu is not satisfied with the budget planning as it completely ignored the special status and special package for the state. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and chief minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal said on Twitter that the budget contained nothing for the middle class and traders. Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, Janta Dal (United) (JDU) leader, praised the budget for the proposals on minimum support price for farmers and the healthcare scheme. Congress leader and former finance minister P. Chidambaram said that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had failed the fiscal consolidation test, and that there was no relief for the average taxpayer. = Stock market = Both of India's national indices, the BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50, fell sharply in the aftermath of the budget. The government, however, said that the fall in the stock market was not solely due to the budget. Finance and Revenue Secretary, Dr. Hasmukh Adhia said that fall in stock indices was due to global market meltdown, and not because of the reintroduction of LTCG tax, he added the government will look into the slump. = Others = Credit rating agency, Fitch, said that the budget, whilst supporting growth, does not address the problem of fiscal consolidation, and leaves the problem of India's relatively weak finances, to the next government. Economic Affairs Secretary, Subhash Chandra Garg, said, that the government would try to convince credit rating agencies, like Standard and Poor's and Fitch, on its commitments to fiscal consolidation.

The legislation is part of the historical policy of the Law and Justice party which seeks to present a narrative of ethnic Poles exclusively as victims and heroes. The law was met with widespread international criticism as it is seen as an infringement on freedom of expression, academic freedom, and a barrier to open discussion on Polish collaborationism. The law is part of a broader wave of memory laws in Central and Eastern Europe which has gone along with the rise of illiberal democracy in the region. Article 2a, which requires the Institute of National Remembrance to investigate crimes against Polish citizens by Ukrainian nationalists, also caused controversy. As most Ukrainians residing in Poland had Polish citizenship, Article 2a indicates that the law's references to the \\"Polish nation\\" must be understood in an ethnic sense. While the act does not mention the \\"Polish death camp\\" controversy (involving concentration camps that had been built by Nazi Germany during World War II on German-occupied Polish soil), the act's chief intent was to address that controversy. Under the Act, charges of offending the \\"good name\\" of Poland or the Polish nation may be brought by the Institute of National Remembrance or by accredited NGOs such as the Polish League Against Defamation. Originally, offenses against the \\"good name\\" of Poland were punishable as criminal offenses with up to 3 years in prison. Following an international outcry, a June 2018 amendment modified the \\"good-name\\" offense to a civil offense that can be prosecuted in civil courts. The June 2018 amendment also removed exceptions for research and the arts that were present in the original law.  History  A 2006 amendment with some of the same aims, Article 132a of the Polish Penal Code, was passed in 2006 with the efforts of Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro, but was invalidated two years later. The amendment was seen as targeting the writings of historian Jan T. Gross, whose work on the Jedwabne Pogrom triggered wide public debate in Poland; the amendment was frequently dubbed Lex Gross (Latin: Gross's Law).The Polish ‚ÄòHolocaust Law‚Äô revisited: The Devastating Effects of Prejudice-Mongering, Marta Bucholc and Maciej Komornik, Cultures of History, 19 February 2019Rzepa, Joanna. \\"Translation, conflict and the politics of memory: Jan Karski's Story of a Secret State.\\" Translation Studies 11.3 (2018): 315-332. After a period of lobbying, the first version of the 2018 Amendment was drafted on 17 February 2016 by Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro. On 30 August 2016 the Council of Ministers, presided over by Prime Minister Beata Szyd≈Ço, forwarded the draft to the Sejm. In September 2016, Zbigniew Ziobro asserted that the \\"Polish death camp\\" term constituted an attack on the \\"good name of the Polish nation\\". The proposed legislation was criticized internationally as an attempt to suppress discussion of crimes that had been committed during the Holocaust by Polish citizens. The addition of the \\"ban on propaganda of Banderism\\" to the law (Article 2a) was spearheaded by the right-wing political movement, Kukiz'15. Kukiz'15 submitted this addition on July 16, 2016, however it was blocked by Civic Platform and Law and Justice parties citing \\"the good of Polish‚ÄìUkrainian relations\\". Eventually, Article 2a was added to the bill on 25 January 2018 during the second reading. On 26 January 2018, after the bill's third reading, the Polish Parliament's lower chamber, the Sejm, approved the bill, which would apply to Poles as well as to foreigners. On 1 February 2018 the upper chamber, the Senate, passed the bill without amendment. On 6 February 2018 President Andrzej Duda signed the bill into law. According to an opinion poll conducted in February 2018, 51% of Poles opposed the 2018 amendment. Some parts of the law will come into effect 14 days after its registration in Dziennik Ustaw (the Register of Statutes), with the full law coming into effect within 3 months. The law is was referred to the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland for review of its compliance with the Polish Constitution. The bill led to an outcry of condemnations against Poland in the United States, Europe, and Israel. Some critics went so far as to accuse the Polish government of Holocaust denial. The Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory urging Jews to refrain from visiting Poland due to \\"Poland‚Äôs government campaign to change the historical truth by denying Polish complicity in the Nazi atrocities\\". As of May 2018, 70 different charges under the act were filed in Polish courts. Most, however, were by Polish citizens protesting the law by filing a self-incrimination. A non-protest charge was filed against the BBC for a production on the Auschwitz concentration camp that used the term \\"Polish Jewish ghettos\\". Original bill The proposed law modifies a previous law relating to the Institute of National Remembrance (namely, the Act of 18 December 1998 on the Institute of National Remembrance ‚Äì Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation (Dz.U. 1998 nr 155 poz. 1016)). The following main articles were added in February 2018: *Article 55a: > 1\\\\. Whoever claims, publicly and contrary to the facts, that the Polish > Nation or the Republic of Poland is responsible or co-responsible for Nazi > crimes committed by the Third Reich, as specified in Article 6 of the > Charter of the International Military Tribunal enclosed to the International > agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of > the European Axis, signed in London on 8 August 1945 (Polish Journal of Laws > of 1947, item 367), or for other felonies that constitute crimes against > peace, crimes against humanity or war crimes, or whoever otherwise grossly > diminishes the responsibility of the true perpetrators of said crimes‚Äîshall > be liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to 3 years. The sentence shall be > made public. 2\\\\. If the act specified in clause 1 is committed > unintentionally, the perpetrator shall be liable to a fine or a restriction > of liberty. 3\\\\. No offence is committed if the criminal act specified in > clauses 1 and 2 is committed in the course of the one‚Äôs artistic or academic > activity.‚Äô *Article 2a: > The crimes of Ukrainian nationalists and members of Ukrainian organizations > collaborating with the Third German Reich, as defined in the Act, are acts > committed by Ukrainian nationalists in the years 1925‚Äì1950, involving the > use of violence, terror or other forms of violation of human rights, against > individuals or ethnic groups. One of the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists > and members of Ukrainian organizations collaborating with the Third German > Reich is their involvement in the extermination of the Jewish population and > genocide on citizens of the Second Polish Republic in Volhynia and Eastern > Lesser Poland.\\" Article 55a  Historians widely agree that some Poles were complicit in the Holocaust, betraying and murdering Jews.Holocaust law wields a 'blunt instrument' against Poland's past, BBC, Joel Gunter, 3 February 2018 Article 55a was condemned by Holocaust Charities, the United States, the European Union, and Israel for being an obstacle to free discussions on Polish complicity in the Holocaust. A letter signed by many prominent persons in early February, including journalist Anne Applebaum and the 3rd President of Poland Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski, said: \\"Why should the victims and witnesses of the Holocaust have to watch what they say for fear of being arrested, and will the testimony of a Jewish survivor who ‚Äúfeared Poles‚Äù be a punishable offence?\\". According to Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett of the POLIN museum, \\"These attempts to legislate what can and cannot be said is actually destroying the good name of Poland.\\" Former prime minister Donald Tusk tweeted, \\"Whoever spreads the false phrase about \\"Polish camps\\" is detrimental to the good name and interests of Poland. The authors of the law have promoted this vile slander to the whole world as effectively as no one has before. So, according to the law ...\\" Even before being passed, the law damaged the Israel‚ÄìPoland relations. Israel's Foreign Ministry director-general Yuval Rotem reported that preserving the memory of the Holocaust takes priority over international relations. He said that \\"Preserving the memory of the Holocaust is a matter beyond the bilateral relationship between Israel and Poland. It is a core issue cutting to the essence of the Jewish people\\". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Poland of Holocaust denial. Yad Vashem condemned the Polish bill, saying that, while \\"Polish death camps\\" as a phrase is a historic misrepresentation, the legislation is \\"liable to blur the historical truths regarding the assistance the Germans received from the Polish population during the Holocaust\\". In the U.S., Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed \\"disappointment\\" in the bill, adding: \\"Enactment of this law adversely affects freedom of speech and academic inquiry.\\" Jeffrey Kopstein of the University of Toronto and Jason Wittenberg of the University of California, Berkeley, authors of the book, Intimate Violence: Anti-Jewish Pogroms on the Eve of the Holocaust, about anti-Jewish violence in Poland such as the Szczuczyn pogrom, opine that the purpose of the new bill \\"is clear: to restrict discussion of Polish complicity.\\" They also suggest that \\"Poland‚Äôs current government will likely face the unpalatable prospect of enforcing an unenforceable law and denying what the mainstream scholarly community has increasingly shown to be true: Some Poles were complicit in the Holocaust.\\" Prof. Stanis≈Çaw Krajewski of the University of Warsaw, who co-chairs the Polish Council of Christians and Jews, said that \\"The way the law is formulated makes it a blunt instrument for paralysing and punishing anyone you don't like\\", and that \\"the government's harsh, dismissive reaction to critics has encouraged many people to think they can now attack Jews.\\" On 5 March 2018, in front of the Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw and Wroc≈Çaw, 45 Polish citizens made public statements referring to historical events, including the Jedwabne pogrom and the Szczuczyn pogrom. The citizens claimed that they attributed responsibility for the events and alleged that their public statements constituted criminal acts under Article 55a of the amended Act of the Institute of National Memory. In the Prosecutors' offices, the citizens deposited formal written documents reporting their alleged crimes. In The Indian Yearbook of Comparative Law, Indian scholar Kanika Gauba wrote that, whereas Holocaust legislation in other countries enacts a duty to remember by means of criminalizing Holocaust denial, the Polish bill enacts a duty to forget by instituting \\"collective amnesia\\" on the complicity of part of the Polish population in the Holocaust. =Amendment= Pressure from the United States Department of State and threat of downgrading the US-Poland relationship were significant in causing the Polish government to change course.Szklarski, Bohdan, and Piotr Ilowski. \\"Searching for Solid Ground in Polish-American Relations in the Second Year of the Trump Administration.\\" (2019): 65-82. In late June 2018, the Polish government decided to stop waiting for a ruling from the constitutional court and in a hasty process, the legislation passed in a single day, modified the act. The revision removed the possibility of criminal prosecution, but also removed the exemption of scholarship and arts from the law. While violating the \\"good name\\" of Poland provision is no longer a criminal charge, charges may still be levied in a civil court. Following the amendment, the Polish and Israeli prime ministers issued a joint declaration condemning antisemitism and rejecting \\"anti- Polonism\\". This statement was condemned by Yad Vashem and its former director, Holocaust survivor Yitzhak Arad, because it was seen as equating the two. =Prosecutions= The first case to be brought under the law was by Polish League Against Defamation against an Argentine newspaper, Pagina/12, and its journalist Federico Pavlovsky, who used a picture of cursed soldiers to illustrate an article on the Jedwabne pogrom. Pagina/12 published an article that stated: \\"If successful, this attempt at international censorship could threaten freedom of expression worldwide.\\" In 2019, the League lost an 18-month lawsuit in which it alleged that Jewish News had defamed the Polish nation with an article titled \\"Polish restitution law excludes most Holocaust survivors and heirs\\". In 2020, it lost an appeal against the verdict. In particular, the League objected to the fact that the article referred to \\"Nazis\\" instead of \\"German Nazis\\" and did not explicitly state that \\"Germans\\" were responsible for killing 90% of Poland's Jewish population. In 2019, a case against Gross for writing that Poles had killed more Jews than Germans during the war was dropped after a right-wing historian, Piotr Gontarczyk, said that no reliable statistics are available on the matter. Article 2a In 2019, article 2a was decreed to be void and non-binding by the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland. The Amendment's passage worsened Polish‚ÄìUkrainian relations, already contentious on the questions of the prewar Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the wartime and postwar Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych have been considered Ukrainian national heroes in Ukraine, and war criminals in Poland. In Ukraine, the Amendment has been called \\"the Anti-Banderovite Law\\". The director of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance, Volodymyr Viatrovych, asserted that the Amendment's principal target is Ukrainians residing in Poland. The Polish law has been compared to Ukrainian Law 2538-1, passed in 2015. Mission statement change Article 1 - the mission statement of the Institute - was changed to include \\"protecting the reputation of the Republic of Poland and the Polish Nation\\". Prof. Havi Dreifuss, head of Yad Vashem's Center for Research on the Holocaust in Poland, noted that with the change of the law in question the IPN‚Äôs fundamental role has changed and this was reflected in their mission statement.

He was also a co-founder of the Association for Medical Mission at Stuttgart that evolved into the German Institute for Medical Mission (Dif√§m), an organization for worldwide Christian medical mission based in T√ºbingen.  Early life  Coat of arms of the Liebend√∂rfer family The Liebend√∂rfer family had been living in the W√ºrttemberg region since the end of the Thirty Years' War. Eugen Liebend√∂rfer was the son of Jakob Friedrich Liebend√∂rfer (who died in 1880 at Wain), who was the station commander of the Landj√§ger special police force in Leutkirch, and Elisabeth Lochbiller from Memmingen (who died in 1899 at Ravensburg).  Work in India  Inspired by the Swabian Pietism movement of the German Lutheran church, Eugen Liebend√∂rfer joined the Basel Mission. After training in Basel, he travelled to India as a missionary in 1875 at the age of 23. He arrived at the West Indian port of Calicut (Kozhikode) on 1 October 1875 and moved to work at the mission station at Thalassery, Malabar District (in the state of Kerala in modern south India) which was then part of the Madras Presidency of British Raj. Until 1846, this mission station used to be supervised by Julie and Hermann Gundert, who were the grandparents of Hermann Hesse. On 5 November 1878, he married Emilie Lydia Layer (born in 1856 in Wilhelmsdorf, W√ºrttemberg) at the mission station at Thalassery. Liebend√∂rfer regularly published articles in a Malayalam news periodical and described the internal structure of the human body; in the opinion of Wilhelm Schlatter, the historiographer of the Basel Mission, the Indian doctors were not knowledgeable about this. He also prepared two booklets that discussed on the topics of caring for little children and marital responsibilities. On 7 July 1882 Liebend√∂rfer witnessed the tragic death of 60 people due to a bridge collapse incident caused by a ferry that had rammed into a bridge pier. However, he was able to rescue and supply 20 people from the river. Driven by this painful experience, he returned home by 1883 and studied medicine in Basel for about three and a half years, from 1883 to 1886. His thesis published in 1886 was titled \\"√úber den Einfluss des Tropenklimas auf den Europ√§er : mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung Ostindiens\\". After completing his medical education, he became the first medical missionary doctor in India and remained so until 1896. During this period, he rebuilt and furnished a hospital at Calicut. His success won him respect among the local population, even as they compared his modern medical treatment methods to those of a traditional local healer, although he attributed the medical success of his work as a work of God. He introduced a revolutionary change in the region, when he could start to treat women and examine them by listening with a stethoscope. Eventually, the British government also handed him over the leadership of a Leper hospital. As the medical mission became more important and popular, many women from Malabar were also trained as doctors and nurses. In 1893, he opened another small hospital in Kottakkal, about 44 km south of Calicut, and trained Indian doctors there. The funds required to run the hospital was raised from the people around, including resident British and natives; the church members of Kottakkal also contributed according to their ability, the poor offered one or two days of free labour at the hospital in lieu of monetary contributions.  Return to Germany  By the end of 1895, owing to his serious illness, he returned to Stuttgart. He spent time in the Kurhaus Palmenwald in Freudenstadt, where he had friendly and close contact with the parents of Hermann Hesse. In 1898, together with the entrepreneur Paul Lechler, Liebend√∂rfer founded the Association for Medical Mission as an aid organization of the Basel Mission. Liebend√∂rfer was the first managing director of this association and remained so until shortly before his death. The Association for Medical Mission formed the basis for the current Dif√§m (German Institute for Medical Mission).  Death  Eugen Liebend√∂rfer had chronic health issues and died at the age of 50 years in Stuttgart on 3 October 1902.  Legacy  The hospitals he built at Calicut are still intact and one serves as a dormitory for girls. A second mission hospital was also built at Bettageri, Coorg as part of the Basel medical mission.

The Command of the Main Staff often came into clashed with civilian authorities, partly because of different perception of political repercussions of military operations on world public opinion (political leadership of Republika Srpska was, naturally, more sensitive on international pressures), and partly because of interweaving of responsibilities, especially about material and financial supply of the Army.Balkan Battlegrounds Vol.2, pp. 268 According to opinion of some experts who studied the course of the Bosnian War, the Command of the Main Staff of the Army of Republika Srpska proved to be the most capable military leadership among the participants in the war:  Chiefs of the General Staff  See also  * Army of Republika Srpska * Ministry of Defence (Republika Srpska)  References  Bibliography  * Balkan Battlegrounds: A Military History of the Yugoslav Conflict, 1990‚Äì1995 Volume I and II.

The type and only species is Mansourasaurus shahinae. The discovery of Mansourasaurus was considered quite significant by paleontologists, because very few Late Cretaceous sauropod remains had been found in Africa where the rocky strata that preserve remains elsewhere and produce rich fossil beds were typically not found exposed at or near ground level. Discovery and naming Voice of America report about the discovery Hesham Sallam, a paleontologist at Mansoura University, together with a team of students discovered a sauropod skeleton in the Dakhla Oasis in Egypt's Western Desert. In 2016, it was reported that over thirty dinosaur specimens had been excavated, among them titanosaurian sauropods.Iman El-Dawoudi, Patrick M O'Connor, Mahmoud Kora and Joseph J W Sertich, 2016, \\"NEW DINOSAUR REMAINS FROM THE CAMPANIAN QUSEIR FORMATION, WESTERN DESERT, EGYPT\\", SVP October 2016, Program and Abstracts, p 129 Based on this skeleton, the type species Mansourasaurus shahinae was named and described in January 2018, by Hesham M. Sallam, Eric Gorscak, Patrick M. O'Connor, Iman A. El-Dawoudi, Sanaa El-Sayed, Sara Saber, Mahmoud A. Kora, Joseph J. W. Sertich, Erik R. Seiffert and Matthew C. Lamanna. The generic name refers to the Mansoura University. The specific name honours Mona Shahin, one of the founders of the Mansoura University Vertebrate Paleontology Center. The Mansourasaurus specimen described in 2018 is its holotype, MUVP 200, discovered in a layer of the Quseir Formation dating from the late Campanian, about seventy-three million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull and lower jaws. It contains a fragment of the skull roof, a part of the lower braincase, the dentaries of the lower jaws, three neck vertebrae, two back vertebrae, eight ribs, the right scapula, the right coracoid, both humeri, a radius, a third metacarpal, three metatarsals, and parts of osteoderms. The skeleton was found on a surface of four by three metres. It was not articulated. The authors concluded that the holotype is a juvenile specimen, because the bones of its shoulder girdle had not yet fused. An ulna, specimen MUVP 201, found at twenty metres distance from the skeleton, was not referred to the species as it seemed somewhat too large for the holotype individual and a general connection to the species could not be proven. Description The‚Äînot fully-grown‚Äîholotype individual was about long. It probably weighed about 5,000 kg, approximately the same as a bull African elephant. The describing authors indicated a number of distinguishing traits. These are autapomorphies, unique derived characters. Each lower jaw dentary bears ten teeth. Where the dentaries touch each other, at the front of the lower jaws, they possess a common \\"chin\\", equalling a third of the front height. The horizontal groove in the inner side of the dentary, the fossa Meckeliana, largely opens to below. The anterior middle neck vertebrae are pierced by a foramen in the rear side. In at least one anterior middle neck vertebra the parapophysis, the process which bears the facet for the lower rib head, has a horizontal length equal to the vertebral centrum as a whole. With some anterior neck vertebrae, the bone web between the heads of the neck rib is pierced by a foramen. The lower end of the radius has a transverse width four times larger than the width measured from the front to the rear. Phylogeny Mansourasaurus was placed in the Titanosauria in a derived position as a sister species of Lohuecotitan. A cladistic analysis showed it to belong to a clade of otherwise largely Eurasian sauropods, also including Ampelosaurus, Lirainosaurus, Nemegtosaurus, Opisthocoelicaudia and Paludititan, more or less contemporaneous forms. Hypotheses about relationships between Late Cretaceous African and Eurasian sauropods had been hard to test, because very few of their remains had been found in Africa. Mansourasaurus represents the best-known continental African (i.e. excluding Madagascar) titanosaur of the Upper Cretaceous from the time period after the Cenomanian. Its existence would show that the continent was far less isolated from the various Eurasian landmasses than had been assumed. The ancestors of Mansourasaurus would have reached Africa from Europe.

It was produced and written by Rip Van Ronkel and directed by Joseph Pevney.  Summary  James Benedict, the director of the United States space program, is in charge of operations aboard an American rotating wheel space station, the first of its kind. The imminent launch from the station of the first manned lunar orbital spacecraft is aborted due to a meteor impact. Benedict testifies before a United States Senate committee, some of whose members believe that the construction of the station was an unnecessary expense which is delaying achievement of the Moon mission. An impartial observer, Dr. Kurt Easton, is sent to the space station to observe operations as the crew prepares for the second attempt to launch the Moon mission. This launch is also aborted, however, when the lunar spacecraft's nuclear engine malfunctions due to ice buildup, necessitating rapid action by Dave Reynolds, the spacecraft's commander, to prevent an explosion. Meanwhile, Benedict, whose long-term romantic relationship has not yet led to marriage, finds himself to be one corner of a love quadrangle when Reynolds' wife reveals that she is in love with him.  Cast  * Harry Townes: James Benedict * John Agar: Matthews * Charles Aidman: Dave Reynolds * Whitney Blake: Jane Kramer * Gail Kobe: Kim Reynolds * Edward C. Platt: Kurt Easton  Production history  According to science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl, \\"virtually no information [is] available about this film.\\" Westfahl speculated that Destination Space, a joint production of Paramount Pictures and CBS, was actually a pilot for a prospective TV series about space travel, produced in competition with the pilot for Men into Space. According to Westfahl's theory, CBS chose the latter series, which debuted in 1959.Westfahl, p. 51. Rip Van Ronkel, the producer and writer of Destination Space, was the co-screenwriter of the 1950 science fiction film Destination Moon. Destination Space makes extensive use of stock footage from the 1955 Paramount science fiction film Conquest of Space. Reception The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction found the movie to be weighed down by a forced romantic triangle and more talking than action; however, the movie had some positive points. The movie points out the extreme cost of space travel and strives for realism. The movie also notes the dangers of space travel as many missions have failed. In all, the Encyclopedia found the movie of interest.

Bailovic held the civil service rank of civil servant () and was promoted to senior civil servant or Oberregierungsrat in 1944. Bailovic was considered an anti-Nazi, who held anti-Nazi views, and refused to wear German decorations, when in uniform. Bailovic was also a Turkish interpreter and spent significant time in evaluation, providing intelligence. Military career Bailovic was a colonel in the Austro-Hungarian Army, who served as an officer in Trieste and was director of the Austrian cipher bureau during World War I. He was considered a middle ranking official of the Austrian cipher section, by Fenner, before and during World War II. During the Anschluss, Bailovic refused to surrender the keys of his department to the Nazis when Austria was subsumed. Subsequently, he was relegated to a minor position in the Austrian civil service. General Erich Fellgiebel and Fritz Thiele, recognising his potential, ordered Wilhelm Fenner to Vienna, to bring Bailovic, along with seven of his colleagues back to Germany, to be employed as cryptanalysts and evaluators. In the final tally, only 4 people came back with Bailovic, that included Joseph Seifert, the then current director of the Austrian cipher bureau. Upon their landing in Germany, a Forschungsamt official met the party at the airport where the Forschungsamt (abbr. FA) official offered money to Bailovic to work for them, which Fenner found disturbing. Bailovic initially worked for the FA, which was the Luftwaffe's chief Hermann G√∂ring private cipher bureau, specifically for the Nazi Party. Bailovic worked at the FA unit for several months, when he left unexpectedly and was known to be employed by Inspectorate 7/VI by Autumn 1941, when he ran the Balkan desk. During this period, the results from solving both codes and cyphers in the Balkan section were generally forwarded to KONA 4, the Signals unit assigned to the Balkans theatre. For much of his working life in Inspectorate 7/VI, Bailovic ran the informal Bailovic Party, that was an anti-nazi clique. After the 20 July plot, the Nazi, Grupperleiter Major Lechner was appointed to replace Major Mettig as commander of In 7/VI. The Bailovic Party held the most able personnel and was highly regarded, but dwindling Balkan traffic meant the unit became superfluous, and lost most of the prestige and power. With a new Nazi leader in Major Lechner, the group was disbanded. Bailovic was removed from the unit, along with several others, with Lechner being posted to the west to become commander of KONA 6. In October 1944, Bailovic was appointed to the OKW/Chi in the position as head of the desk dealing specifically with Balkan traffic. Towards the end of the war, he became an administrator, after the Balkans were invaded as Balkan message traffic dwindled and became progressively rarer, as the war reached its conclusion.

It was built for sugar manufacturer Christian R√∏nnenkamp in 1829 and was listed on the Danish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places in 1950. History Christian R√∏nnenkamp A sugar refinery known as St. Croix Sugar House was established at the site by √òsters√∏isk-guineisk Handelsselskab in c. 1783. The company was liquidized in 1787 and the sugar refinery finally closed during the economic crisis of the war with England and the bombardment of Copenhagen in 1907. It was finally sold in auction to Christian R√∏nnenkamp who already owned a sugar refinery in Dronningens Rv√¶rgade. He constructed the building at Amaliegade 4 in 1828-29 and moved his sugar business to the new site. He lived in the building at No. 4 but also used it as a retail outlet. In 1835, R√∏nnenkamp purchased the estates of N√¶sbyg√•rd and Bavelse from the Danish government. He then sold his property in Copenhagen and the sugar refinery closed but at least in the beginning he seems to have experimented with cultivation of sugar beats on his new estates. Count Carl von Moltke, who had lived at Sankt Ann√¶ Plads 15 for the last nine years, moved to Amaliegasde 4 in 1854 or 184 but soon thereafter continued to Amaliegade 17.

Life and career The Black Night Shade was a black stallion sired by Poison and out of Final's Call Girl. His grandsires were both World Grand Champions; his paternal grandsire was The Pushover and his maternal grandsire was Pride's Final Edition. He was bred by Mark Chandler of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee and foaled on June 20, 1998.http://www.walkerswest.com/Champs/TheBlackNightShade.htm When The Black Night Shade was only a few hours old, his dam died of colic. Chandler took the orphaned colt to Special Care in Shelbyville, Tennessee. He was fed goat's milk with a bottle every hour day and night for his first two weeks; it was then cut to every two hours. The Black Night Shade was named by the workers at the farm, who had been looking at a medical book and noticed that black nightshade is a poisonous plant; they thought the name was appropriate since the colt was sired by Poison. When The Black Night Shade was 16 months old, Chandler sent him to trainer Jimmy McConnell's Formac Stables, located in Union City, Tennessee, to begin his early training. Chandler had told McConnell he would sell the colt, but McConnell did not want to see The Black Night Shade sold out of his stable. He contacted a couple he knew were looking to purchase a Walking Horse, Tom and Judy Waite, and they bought The Black Night Shade sight unseen. He was their first show horse. McConnell showed The Black Night Shade sparingly as a two-year-old, because he thought the colt was too small and underdeveloped in comparison with other horses his age, as a result of being bottlefed. The Black Night Shade won his first blue ribbon in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration as a two-year-old. As a three-year-old he won the stallion preliminary class for his age division. The following year, he had some difficulty and McConnell made a last-minute decision to show him in a stake class against aged horses, those five years or older. The Black Night Shade won the class and for the rest of the season competed against aged horses, except at the Celebration. In 2003 he was officially an aged horse and won multiple stakes before entering the Celebration. He placed second in the World Grand Championship, making him the Reserve World Grand Champion. McConnell and the Waites believed he could win, and the following year he won the World Grand Championship. The Black Night Shade died on January 14, 2008. He had been standing at stud at Joe Martin Stables at the time of his death.

In comparison to the Canada Company, a similar enterprise in Upper Canada that thrived through collaboration with the local government, the BALC indulged in land speculation, made immigration a secondary priority, and struggled throughout its existence. History=Origin and formation= Following the success of the Canada Company in spurring settlement efforts in Upper Canada, similar efforts were initiated to establish a similar company to promote settlement in the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada. A group of investors in Montreal, headed by Francis Nathaniel Burton, proposed organizing a Lower Canada Land Company, and sent William Bowman Felton to London to promote their venture. While there, he encountered a group with similar objectives. The groups decided to combine together, and, at a meeting in February 1832, decided to proceed with creating the British American Land Company. It was incorporated by royal charter in March 1834, and secured a private Act from the Parliament of the United Kingdom, enabling it to: #operate directly in any of the Provinces and colonies in British North America by virtue of the Royal charter, and appoint Commissioners and Agents for the purpose of purchasing and disposing of land therein; #where any seigniorial lands are acquired by the Company (whether held √† titre de fief et seigneurie, √† titre de fief en arri√®re-fief, or √† titre de cens), commute all feudal and seigniorial rights, so that such lands will be held in free and common socage (and any Crown lands acquired by the Company would have the same status); and #hire indentured servants, for periods of time not to exceed seven years, for service in British North America.

This consisted of of unsurveyed lands in the County of Sherbrooke; together with in Crown reserves and surveyed Crown lands in the Counties of Sherbrooke, Shefford and Stanstead. It would later acquire further lands through public auctions and private sales, bringing its total holdings up to . Upon Fraser's appointment in 1835, the Company's activities began in earnest, being concentrated in three places: #Sherbrooke, as the Company's headquarters #Victoria, in Lingwick Township, as the centre of settlement activities #Port St. Francis, at the foot of Lake Saint Pierre, as the port of entry for the district Colonization efforts Wharves and warehouses were constructed at Port St. Francis, as were grist mills, sawmills and other facilities within the territory. Lands were sold subject to a 20% down payment, with the balance payable in three subsequent annual instalments, and the Company also offered to help clear the land and build a log house upon it for an extra charge. During 1836, during the first year of activity, three hundred families had settled in Victoria, occupying , while had been sold in other districts. By deliberately working to increase the English-speaking portion of the population of Lower Canada, it was denounced by the Parti patriote and was referred to in the Ninety-two Resolutions adopted by the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in 1834. It was also denounced during the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1837, where a proclamation issued by Patriote leader Robert Nelson declared that all unsold Company lands \\"are of right the property of the State of Lower Canada.\\" Sherbrooke, where the Saint-Fran√ßois and Magog Rivers meet (1839). The British American Land Company would later exploit the waterpower arising from its water rights to promote the town's industrial development. The expenses incurred to open up the lands were high in relation to the revenues earned from their subsequent disposition. The 1837 Rebellion discouraged immigration to Lower Canada, frightening off the better class of potential immigrants, and many of the current settlers were defaulting on their payments or even abandoning their lands. Many of the local agents were also neglecting their duties or pilfering the company stores, and the Company resisted attempts by local councils to impose property taxes on its holdings. This would eventually lead to the Company experiencing financial problems in 1841, forcing it to return of the St. Francis tract to the Province of Canada. In 1843, the Company began focus its efforts on selling land to the local French-Canadian population, disposing it on new terms, consisting of no down payment, interest payments only for the first ten years, with the principal then being payable in four equal annual instalments. In the beginning, such obligations could be settled by payment in kind. In 1858, the Company returned a further to the Province, in consideration for certain sums due to the Crown. Exploitation of natural resources and manufacturing The Company's finances would subsequently improve, and its earnings would be invested in other industrial concerns, including railroads, mining and Sherbrooke's textile mills, and it would operate other industrial enterprises itself. It would also get into the business of lending money, and, in 1876, the law governing interest was modified with respect to the loans made by the Company, so that it could charge an annual rate up to 8%, in place of the then legal maximum of 6%. It would also begin to sell landholdings in large blocks for their value as timber. In 1872, it sold to Cyrus Sullivan Clark of Bangor, Maine, who purchased a further from the company in the following year. These holdings were approximately half the size of the Crown timber limits that he already possessed. Later years By 1910, it had sold the greater part of its holdings, but continued to operate until its dissolution in 1948. Most of the Company's records appear to have since been carelessly destroyed.

Concerned with what they saw as a diversion between Christian faith and a commitment to social justice, the Chicago Declaration was written as a call to reject racism, economic materialism, economic inequality, militarism, and sexism. Under the leadership of Ron Sider, The Chicago Declaration became the founding document for Evangelicals for Social Action, a think-tank which seeks to develop biblical solutions to social and economic problems through incubating programs that operate at the intersection of faith and social justice.  Description  At the first Calvin College conference on politics that Paul B. Henry organized in the spring of 1973, several organizers, including David Moberg, Rufus Jones, and Paul Henry, decided to call a weekend workshop over Thanksgiving, 1973. The committee invited a broad range of evangelical leaders to come and talk about the need for strengthening evangelical social concern. Nearly forty individuals attended: older evangelicals like Carl F. H. Henry, Frank Gaebelein; younger evangelicals like Jim Wallis, John Perkins, Sharon Gallagher, Rich Mouw, and Ron Sider. Perhaps fittingly, they held their meeting at the YMCA on Wabash Avenue in Chicago. The assembled individuals wrote and signed The Chicago Declaration of Evangelical Social Concern, confessing the failure of evangelical Christianity to confront injustice, racism, and discrimination against women, and pledging to do better. The Chicago Declaration of Evangelical Social Concern became the founding document for Evangelicals for Social Action, which was founded in 1974. Dick Ostling of Time magazine wrote that it was probably the first time in the 20th century that forty evangelical leaders spent a whole weekend discussing social action. Writing for the Chicago Sun Times, Roy Larson declared that someday, church historians would write that ‚Äúthe most significant church-related event of 1973\\" at this gathering. As Christianity Today magazine noted on the 30th anniversary of the declaration, the conference's stated purpose wouldn't register as surprising today, when evangelicals from all different political stripes agree that at least some form of social justice is a central tenant of the Christian faith. But \\"...Thirty years ago, only a frustrated minority‚Äîlike those at the Chicago meeting‚Äîthought so...Three decades ago, a lot of evangelicals would have called this political meddling, if not selling out the gospel.\\"  Signatories  * John F.

Lingerie dresses were worn by various classes of women in North America and Europe in the decade of the 1900s up to the 1920s.

In their first season together, the Englot rink won the 2017 Manitoba Scotties Tournament of Hearts, and went all the way to the final of the 2017 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, after finishing the round robin in first place, with a 10-1 record. The team would lose in the final against Team Ontario, skipped by Rachel Homan. Their successful season qualified the team for the 2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, but they would have less success there, finishing with a 2-6 record. However, as the Rachel Homan team won the event, and would go on to represent Canada at the Olympics, the Englot rink would be invited to play as Team Canada at the 2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, a spot normally reserved for the defending champions. There, the team finished with a 6-5 record, in 6th place, missing the playoffs. Also that season, the team would play in the 2018 Continental Cup of Curling. After the 2017-18 season Wilson-Westcott announced that she would be taking time off to complete her Masters Degree. Personal life Wilson-Westcott is married to Brandy Westcott.

He constructed the listed property at Amaliegade 4 in Copenhagen and owned the estates of N√¶sbyholm (N√¶sbyholm Slot) and Bavelse from 1835. Early life and education R√∏nnenkamp was born in Flensburg in Schleswig-Holstein. He was the son of merchant and hospital superintendent Nicolaj Christian R√∏nnenkamp (1757‚Äì1832,) by his first wife Catharina (Tine) R√∏nnenkamp n√©e Todsen (1763‚Äì87). He was the brother of Hanna R√∂nnenkamp M√ºller (1783-1868). Career in Copenhagen Amaliegade 4 He moved to Copenhagen when he was 15 years old where he first became a merchant's apprentice. R√∏nnenkamp subsequently established his own grocery business on Store Kongensgade. He later established himself as a wholesaler and expanded his business with a sugar refinery in c. 1819. He moved his business to the corner of Sankt Ann√¶ Plads and Amaliegade after acquiring the former St. Croix House in auction in late 1828. St. Croix Sugar House had probably been established by the Baltic Sea Guinea Trading Company (√òsters√∏isk-guineisk Handelsselskab) in about 1893. R√∏nnenkamp constructed the building at present day Amaliegade 4 located in the Frederiksstaden Quarter of central Copenhagen between 1828-29. He sold sugar from the premises and also expanded the activities to comprise refining and sale of salt. N√¶sbyholm and Bavelse R√∏nnenkamp purchased the estates of N√¶sbyholm and Bavelse from the Danish government in 1835. From then on he spent most of his time running his estates. He implemented agricultural reforms and refurbished many of the buildings. Titles R√∏nnenkamp was awarded the title Council of State (Etatsr√•d) in 1852 and Chamberlain (Kammerherre) in 1858. In 1856, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog Family and legacy H. W. Bissen, 1844 On 19 January 1822, R√∏nnenkamp married Jessy Caroline Howden in Helsing√∏r (1796-1872). The couple had no children. They created a number of charities and grants. These included a home for 16 men and women from their two estates in N√¶sby (Den R√∏nnenkampske Stiftelse), a home for old seamen in Flensburg, a grant for purchase of paintings and sculptures and Christiansdal kloster with residences for 24 women. R√∏nnenkamp's widow left an additional DKK 500,000 to Christiansdal kloster. R√∏nnenkamp left the estates at N√¶stbyholm and Bavelse to his sister Hanna's grandson, Peter Christian M√ºller (1854-1930), who adopted the surname Howden-R√∏nnenkamp.

She captured one French privateer and numerous small merchantmen, but spent most of her career escorting convoys to and from the West Indies. She foundered in 1807 while serving on the Halifax, Nova Scotia, station. Design Busy was the sole vessel of her class. Her designer was John Henslow, and she was identical with his contemporaneous except that Busy was a brig-sloop and Echo was a ship-sloop.Winfield (2008), p.282. Henslow's designs were in competition with Sir William Rule's designs for a brig-sloop () and a ship-sloop (). Rule's brig-sloop design won as the Admiralty ultimately ordered 106 Cruizer-class brig-sloops. Career In December 1797 Commander John Ackworth Ommanney (or Ommaney) commissioned Busy for the North Sea. On 7 August 1798 and Busy intercepted off Goree in the North Sea a Swedish convoy under the escort of . The British vessels demanded that the Swedes come into port to have their cargo inspected for enemy (French) cargo. Although Sweden was neutral, Ulla Fersens captain acceded to this demand as the two British vessels out-gunned him and he wanted to avoid loss of life. As Busy was escorting the Swedish vessels into The Downs they encountered a British squadron that had been searching for the Swedes. Ommanney then turned the convoy over to the British squadron.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, pp.30406. The Swedish merchant vessels were inspected, one was seized, and the rest departed. The vessel that was seized was Adelarde, and Busy ended up sharing the prize money with at least ten other vessels. On 29 July 1799 Busy was in company with the hired armed lugger Fox when they captured Der Winter. Then on 2 August they captured Vrow Rica and Neutralitrie and two days later Elizabeth. On 10 August they detained Maximilan Fredericks. On 16 September 1799 Busy captured the French privateer lugger Dragon, of Dunkirk, as Dragon was coming from Norway. After a short chase along the Dutch coast, Ommaney drove her to anchor in heavy surf about five miles from Egmont. Ten men of her crew that were British subjects tried to escape in one of her boats but eight of the men drowned when the boat upset in the surf. Dragon, Citizen Liard, master, was armed with two with two 12-pounder carronades and fourteen 4-pounder guns, eight of which she had thrown overboard during the chase. Ommaney sent Dragon into Yarmouth.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.67. Then Busy took part in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799. On 28 August 1799, the fleet captured several Dutch hulks and ships in the New Diep, in Holland. Babet was listed among the vessels qualifying to share in the prize money. Similarly, Busy was present at the subsequent Vlieter Incident on 30 August. Between November and December Busy was back with her builders who were making good defects in her construction that had been discovered. On 7 February 1800 Busy arrived at Portsmouth with a large convoy from The Downs. Then on 13 February Busy sailed for the Leeward Islands as one of the escorts for a fleet of 150 merchantmen.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.155. While Ommanney was on the Leeward Island's Station, Busy captured or recaptured five vessels: *26 April: sloop Lover, of 98 tons (bm) and 7 men.

Thanks to the testimonies of the Arabs, the West has always known that ancient Egypt was a country of mummies. Today, we know most of the process of mummification, desiccation of bodies obtained through the dry climate of Egypt, the removal of viscera, the use of natron and bandages. Similarly, we know what kind of rituals accompanied the preparation of the corpse, who were responsible for the mummification process. As for why the mummification, it is related to the Egyptian religion, for which it is the guarantee of immortality, the possibility of a new life (life after death). Based on recent radiographic and genetic analyses of bodies, Fran√ßoise Dunand and Roger Lichtenberg take stock of the historical knowledge of mummies, and add a scientific dimension in this small colourful book‚Äî (lit. 'The Mummies: A Journey into Eternity'; US edition ‚Äì Mummies: A Voyage Through Eternity; UK edition ‚Äì Mummies: A Journey Through Eternity)‚Äîpublished by √âditions Gallimard in the series of their collection. According to standards of the collection, the book is richly documented with more than 200 illustrations‚Äîdrawings, paintings, sculptures, X-ray photographs of mummies, etc., which illustrate the body copy as the pages are pretty equally shared between images and texts‚Äîand printed on glossy paper. This book is an archaeological and anthropological study on funeral practices in ancient Egypt. It opens with full-page head shots of nine mummies from the excavated by Dunand's IFAO team. Images from the excavation at the Duch necropolis are also some of the book's highlights. The authors approach the subject from different angles: the discoveries of mummies by the Western world (chap. I, \\"Mummies Come to Light\\"), such as the writings of Herodotus and curiosity of Egyptomania in the 19th century, up to the scientific research of the 20th century with the contribution of radiology techniques (chap. V, \\"Under Expert Analysis\\"). The second chapter‚Äî\\"Making a Better Mummy\\"‚Äîdeals with how the ancient Egyptians mummified a body, while the third chapter, \\"Toward Immortality\\", illustrated with ancient paintings explaining the rites and beliefs. Chapter IV, \\"From Eternal Life to Harsh Reality\\" tells the valuable offerings which the ancient Egyptians furnished with their dead, and the direct consequence of this: the pillaging of tombs. In the last chapter (chap. V), the scientists give anthropological results. In its second part‚Äîthe \\"Documents\\" section‚Äîthe book provides a compilation of excerpts taken from some ancient documents and texts by 19th-century investigators, which is divided into five parts: 1, Funeral Rites; 2, Mummification According to Herodotus; 3, An Unpeaceful End; 4, Two Sensational Discoveries; 5, Looking into Mummies. The book closes with a chronology, map, further reading, list of illustrations and an index. It has been translated into American and British English, Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Russian, South Korean, Spanish, Swedish and traditional Chinese.

He is also the father of fur trader Louis Vasquez. Early life Benito was born in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, in 1738. He was son of Francisco Vasquez and Maria de LaPointe. By that time, the Spanish Army was reorganised on the French model and the old Tercios were transformed into Regiments. At the age of 24, Benito was a soldier in the Infantry Regiment of Leon, Spain. Comparative Atlas of Defence in Latin America / 2008 Edition, p.42 (PDF) In 1766 he arrived in Spanish Louisiana, with the Spanish army, destined to take over the former French possessions. The Spanish Louisiana was ceded to Spain by France after the British victory in the Seven Years' War, when the British gained Florida in exchange with Spain for French lands west of the Mississippi River.Goodwin, 152. Benito came to Spanish Louisiana in the service of the governor Ulloa, under the command of Pedro Piernas They were first stationed at the Spanish fort at Natchez, then transferred to St. Louis. After a brief period they, they left for Cuba when Ulloa was expelled by the French rebels in Neo Orleans. They returned to St. Louis under the command of the new governor, Alejandro O'Reilly. In 1772, Benito finished his active military service shortly thereafter and began his career as a merchant and fur trader. He was made a militia officer and was cited for heroism for his performance against the British in the May 26, 1780 battle of St. Louis. =Marriage and family= In September 1773, it was given to him a land grant in St. Louis by Spanish Lt. Governor Piernas. One year after that, Benito married a french woman called Marie-Julie Papin (daughter of Pierre Papin dit Baronet & Catherine-Marguerite-Madeline Guichard). They had twelve children together; Felicite, Julia, Benito Jr., Francisco Javier, Antoine Francois dit Baronet ( Zebulon Pikes' interpreter and an officer in the 1st US Infantry Regiment who fought at the battles of Tippecanoe, Ft. Madison and Lundy's Lane), Joseph dit Pepe, Victoria, Marie-Antoinette (died in infancy), Hypolite dit Guillory, Celeste, Catherine-Eulalie & the youngest, a famous fur trader called Pierre Louis Vasquez.

Conard, p. 529 As a catholic, Benito Vasquez provided the first bell for the original St. Louis Cathedral, the first catholic church in St. Louis, transporting it up from New Orleans. St Louis Cathedral Records; Vasquez papers file, Missouri Historical Society Library: Pierre Louis Vasquez Bible in possession of Douglas Whitney. Benito‚Äôs house was a poteaux en terre (posts in the earth) house that measured 30 x 25 feet, and was originally built by Rene Kiersereau in 1766. Vasquez bought the house in Block 9 in 1780 with 62 pounds of furs. The house of posts was built on the site of the north leg of the St. Louis arch. Noted activities Benito had trouble making money in the fur trade because he was a small trader trying to compete with the larger interests of the Chouteaus. After denouncing the Spanish governor at New Orleans for not granting him trading rights, Vasquez was jailed for 35 days. Vasquez became one of the major shippers of goods between St. Louis and New Orleans. He was also considered one of St. Louis‚Äô \\"merchant elite.\\" When the first Catholic church was built in St Louis, Vasquez helped finance it and was one of the leading members of its congregation. In 1780, he was appointed lieutenant of the militia formed in anticipation of a British attack on the village. The British and their Native American allies did attack, on May 25-26, 1780, but the garrison and its cannon drove them off. He earned the rank of Captain in 1784. Vasquez decided to ally himself with Jacques Clamorgan and other merchants in the ill-fated Missouri Company of the 1790s. Formed to bring order and greater profits to the fur trading business, the Missouri Company was plagued by a lack of furs, competition from the British, and attacks by Native American tribes. Virtually all of its partners lost their investments, plunging many of them into financial ruin. His fortunes declined and the advent of the Americans in 1804 did nothing to improve them. Vasquez and his wife had to sell their house and were supported by their children. American and European fur traders quickly moved up the Missouri River following the Louisiana Purchase and Lewis and Clark's exploration, but even before that, by 1790, Vasquez decided to ally himself with Jacques Clamorgan and other merchants in the ill-fated Missouri Company. Formed to bring order and greater profits to the fur trading business, the Missouri Company was plagued by a lack of furs, competition from the British, and attacks by Native American tribes. Virtually all of its partners lost their investments, plunging many of them into financial ruin. The next recorded mention of him was in 1794 after he had returned from trading with the Osage tribe. His fortunes declined and the advent of the Americans in 1804 did nothing to improve them. In 1807 the Spanish explorer and fur trader Manuel Lisa began organizing a trade expedition to the upper Missouri River region. The enterprise was led by Lisa himself and Benito Vasquez (Jr,) as his second- in-command. On that expedition, a company of men moved up the Missouri until they reached the mouth of the Yellowstone River. After ascending the Yellowstone more than 150 miles, Benito Vasquez (Jr.) helped Lisa establishing a trading post on November 21 at the mouth of the Bighorn River in present-day Montana. named Fort Raymond. It was the first such outpost in the upper Missouri region. In 1807 Benito was at the Mandan village, on the Missouri with Manuel Lisa, having problems with the Blackfeet.

Vasquez and his wife had to sell their house and were supported by their children. In 1809 Benito V√°squez (Jr,)joined Lisa's Missouri Fur Company, based in St. Louis. The city was developing rapidly based on revenues from the western fur trade. Manuel Lisa sent his trappers to the upper Missouri River for furs.

Noble, photograph date unknown Jordan Bankston Noble also known as Jordan B. Noble (October 14, 1800 - June 20, 1890) was an African American soldier and public figure who is best known for his role as a military drummer in the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. Noble's drum played a crucial role in relaying his commander's orders during the surprise assault against the British forces on December 23, 1814, and the main British advance on January 8, 1815. Jordan Noble also served in the Seminole Wars, Mexican- American War under Zachary Taylor, and the American Civil War for both the Confederacy and the Union.  Early life  Jordan Noble was born in Augusta, Georgia on October 14, 1800, to African and European parents. Although there are no records of who his parents were, it is known that Jordan Noble was born into slavery and was looked after by his mother, who was also a slave. In 1811, he and his mother moved to New Orleans, and took up residence in the old Spanish Barracks. Shortly after, the young Jordan Noble enlisted in the United States Army.  Military service  Jordan B. Noble participated in the Battle of New Orleans Drum used by Jordan B. Noble as a drummer in the Battle of New Orleans = The War of 1812 = At the age of 14, Jordan Noble joined the 7th U.S. Army Regiment in 1812, as a drummer. Military drummers in early American warfare were used to convey orders, and in the fog of war, it was their drumbeats that informed soldiers what to do next.  The Battle of New Orleans  The first firefight of the battle of New Orleans took place on the evening of December 23, 1814. The British forces, led by Admiral Alexander Cochrane and General John Keane landed just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, where they decided to make camp for the night. As the British troops set up camp and waited for the remainder of their forces to join them, Major General Andrew Jackson used this opportunity to launch a surprise attack by water and land. Although one of the units that participated in the American land assault was Major Louis D'Aquin's Battalion of Free Men of Color, Jordan Noble was not among them. He was serving under the 7th Army Regiment. On January 8, 1815, the British launched their main and final assault on the American forces defending New Orleans. During the battle, young Noble held his position and continued the beat on his drum. In the confusion of the battle, this let the troops know what needed to be done, and that the American force was still successfully defending the city. This was the final battle of the War of 1812, as the Treaty of Ghent had recently been signed and was on its way to the United States from Europe.  Military career after the War of 1812  After the Battle of New Orleans and the War of 1812, Jordan B. Noble went on to serve in the Seminole Wars, Mexican-American War under Zachary Taylor, and the American Civil War for both the Confederacy and the Union. His role on both sides of the Civil War was due to his extreme patriotism. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Jordan Noble raised a company of freed African Americans to fight for the Confederacy. After Union General Benjamin Butler took control of New Orleans from the Confederacy, Jordan Noble then raised a company that fought for the U.S.A.  Later life and death  After his military career ended, Jordan B. Noble continued to be a prominent fixture in New Orleans culture. He would participate in parades, be seen around town playing the same drum he used in the Battle of New Orleans and would even recreate the famous drumbeat that was heard during battle.

During the First World War the hospital moved to Bazoilles-sur-Meuse, Department Vosges, in the advance section, France where it was set up to deal with war casualties. History After the United States entered the war in April 1917 its soldiers, as part of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), began to arrive France later that year. To deal with casualties the AEF would take they set a series of hospitals throughout Europe.

Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 2009 based on specimens collected in May 2005 and April 2006. One individual of the new species was collected in 2005, and a second was found in 2006. Later, three more individuals were identified in the mammal collections at Kunming Institute of Zoology that had been originally collected in 1963. Its species name xinanzhongguoensis is pronounced ‚Äúshee-nan-joong-guo-en-sis.‚Äù The name xinanzhongguoensis was derived from the Pinyin words \\"west\\" (xi), \\"south\\" (nan), and \\"China\\" (Zhongguo), describing a species that can be found in southwestern China. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA placed R. xinanzhongguoensis as the basal member of a clade containing Geoffroy's horseshoe bat, greater horseshoe bat, Ruwenzori horseshoe bat, R√ºppell's horseshoe bat, and Darling's horseshoe bat. Phylogenetically, it belongs to the \\"Afro-Palearctic\\" lineage of the horseshoe bat family, as described by Guill√©n-Servent et al. in 2003. Species in the horseshoe bat genus are traditionally divided into \\"species groups\\"; Amador et al. stated that they believe that R. xinanzhongguoensis is so unique, it belongs in its own species group. Description It weighs . It is considered a large member of its genus. Its dorsal fur is \\"dull medium brown\\" and its ventral fur is paler in color. Its flight membranes are dark brown. Its ears are brown, relatively small, and partly transparent. Near its base, the sides of the sella are parallel; it narrows to a wedge-shaped, rounded tip. The lancet is spear-shaped. Its dental formula is typical for a horseshoe bat, at , for a total of 32 teeth. The length of its whole body is ; its forearm is long; its tail is long; its ear is long. Biology It is nocturnal, sleeping in sheltered roosts during the day such as caves. It is known to roost with other horseshoe bats, including the intermediate horseshoe bat. Few individuals have been encountered, so little is known about its reproductive biology. However, a pregnant female was once encountered in April. Range and habitat It occurs in wet habitat within the East Asian Monsoon zone. It has been documented at elevations of above sea level. All three areas where it has been documented are mountainous. Conservation It is currently evaluated as near-threatened by the IUCN. It is only known from three localities and it has an estimated extent of occurrence of . The habitat in areas where it does occur is severely fragmented, with ongoing declines in the extent and quality of the habitat. It is threatened by disturbance of its roosts as caving tourism expands in China. Degradation of its habitat is also caused by logging and agricultural conversion.

It receives core funding from Creative New Zealand and has a major contract with the Department of Corrections. It also has support and sponsorship from local government, philanthropic trusts and businesses around New Zealand. Key activities= Arts Access Awards = Every year, it presents the Arts Access Awards in Parliament. Formerly called the Big ‚ÄòA‚Äô Awards, and as of 2018 named the Te Putanga Toi Arts Access Awards, they were introduced in 2007 to recognise the contribution of individuals and organisations in providing access to the arts. There are currently seven awards, including a Community Partnership award, a Museum award, two Arts in Corrections awards the Arts Access Artistic Achievement Award for artists with a disability or lived experience of mental ill-health, and an Arts Access Accolade, presented to someone who has made a significant contribution to accessibility. =Arts For All Network = The Arts For All initiative began in late 2010 with the release of Arts For All: NgƒÅ toi m≈ç te katoa, a practical guide about ways that arts organisations, museums and galleries can improve and encourage access. The Arts for All Network was established as an ongoing programme in 2011. Networks have been established in Wellington, Auckland, Canterbury, Otago and Taranaki and bring together representatives from the disability sector, arts and cultural organisations, and venues to share resources and ideas about building new audiences by improving access for disabled people. Since 2011, the programme has seen significant improvements in access: for example, audio described and sign interpreted performances are now a regular feature of many performing arts companies.https://artsaccess.org.nz/arts-for- all/uploads/sites/artsaccess/files/images/2014%20creative%20spaces/Arts_For_All_Final_Website_Dec_2014.pdf = Creative spaces = A recognised part of the social services in New Zealand, creative spaces provide a space, a sense of community, resources and support for people to produce art or participate in artistic activities such as theatre, dance, visual arts, creative writing and music. Many are exclusively used by people with disabilities or lived experience of mental ill health, while others are open to a broader cross-section of the community such as youth, unemployed people and people in the criminal justice system. It is estimated that there are around 80 or more creative spaces throughout New Zealand. These include Vincents Art Workshop in Wellington, the first such space established in 1985, as well as Artsenta, which opened in Dunedin in 1986. = Arts in Corrections = Arts Access Aotearoa has a long-standing relationship with the Department of Corrections to facilitate and advise on arts projects and programmes in prisons throughout New Zealand. This has resulted in some exciting initiatives such as an exhibition of prison art in Parliament and a week-long theatre workshop and performance in Arohata Prison led by German theatre director Uta Plate. Other successful projects include two quilting groups run by volunteer quilters, and ballet workshops led by the Royal New Zealand Ballet.

It is the only official museum in China that memorializes the Korean War (called the \\"War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea\\" in China). First established in 1958, it was rebuilt at its current location in October 1990. The new museum was opened on 27 July 1993, the 40th anniversary of the Panmunjom armistice. Since 2014 it has been closed for refurbishment. History The memorial is the only official museum about the Korean War in China. It was first established in 1958 as an annex of the local history museum of Dandong, Liaoning Province, which is China's main border city with North Korea and played a critical role in the Korean War. Construction for a much grander building began in October 1990, and the new museum was opened on 27 July 1993 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Panmunjom armistice. The museum spent more than 10 years collecting all the names of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers killed in the war. In 2006, it announced that it had collected 183,108 names, which has become an authoritative death count of Chinese soldiers in the Korean War. The museum plans to build a \\"martyrs' wall\\" inscribing the complete list of names. In 2008, the memorial was included in the first batch of 83 national first-grade museums of China. In November 2013, however, it was demoted to a second-grade museum in a reassessment. The museum was closed in 2014 for a major refurbishment. As of 2017, it has not yet reopened. Location and facilities The museum is located on Mount Yinghua north of downtown Dandong, overlooking the North Korean city of Sinuiju across the Yalu River. It consists of three major structures: the main exhibition hall, a panoramic painting hall, and a memorial tower, surrounded by a park. It occupies an area of , with a total building floor area of . Exhibitions The exhibition in the main hall comprises more than 700 photographs and over 1,000 artifacts, as well as models, charts, paintings, and sculptures that explain the progress of the war. The exhibition extols the fraternity between the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the (North) Korean People's Army and laments the sufferings of the civilian population in both Korea and China. A major focus of the museum is the sufferings of the Chinese prisoners of war held in the Geoje prison camp in South Korea, with photographs showing Chinese POWs who had anti-Communist slogans forcibly tattooed on them. However, the museum does not mention the discrimination the POWs suffered after they were repatriated to China or the persecution some of them endured during the Cultural Revolution. The panoramic painting hall contains a giant painting depicting the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River (1950), a decisive victory by the People's Volunteer Army. Measuring long and high, it was China's largest panoramic painting when the museum opened in 1993. The painting encircles a revolving viewing platform in the centre of the hall. The memorial tower is tall, which signifies the year 1953, when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. The tower's name is written in the calligraphy of Deng Xiaoping.

The capital of the polity and its chieftain also bore the same name; although neither the chief nor his settlements were ever visited in person by the expedition. Their encounters consisted of messages sent by runners and a three-day long canoe battle on the Mississippi River. Multiple archaeological cultures, archaeological sites, and protohistoric and early historic period Native American groups have been proposed by historians and archaeologists to identify the polity, but their identity will probably never be known with any degree of certainty. De Soto journals=1542 : Messages with Quigualtam= Hudson‚Äôs proposed de Soto route through Arkansas Artist's conception of the Parkin Site, circa 1539 Romanticized depiction of the burial of de Soto by William A. Crafts, 1876 The journals of the Spanish expedition of Hernando de Soto record their encounter with a powerful chiefdom located on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River several days journey below the polity of Guachoya (in present-day Chicot County, Arkansas). By this point the expedition had been traversing the southeast for several years and had spent the majority of the previous year in the area of the modern state of Arkansas among the Late Mississippian culture paramount chiefdoms of Quizquiz, Casqui, and Pacaha, as well as their many vassal states. Modern archaeological research has placed the capital of Casqui at the Parkin Site and equated the polity of Pacaha with the Nodena Phase. Not finding the precious metals and gems the Europeans desired, the expedition left eastern Arkansas and headed west across central Arkansas and into the Ozark Mountains in their search for riches. Finding nothing they considered of value and contending with considerable native resistance; de Soto and his men returned to the Mississippi River, where they found the maize-rich polities of Guachoya and Anilco (thought by some archaeologists and historians to be the Menard-Hodges Site in modern-day Arkansas County, Arkansas). After encountering resistance from Anilco and entreaties of alliance from their traditional enemies, the Guachoya; de Soto made his headquarters at Guachoya. De Soto interrogated the chief about the societies living downstream, hoping to find a rich \\"province\\" to conquer, where he could set up the colony he had delayed founding in his search for more portable valuables. By this time de Soto had begun employing a ruse with the native populations; seeking to convince them that he was an immortal deity, \\"son of the sun\\". After learning of Quigualtum, de Soto sent a message demanding his obeisance and to bring him examples of the most valuable thing in his land; presumably the gold or other riches valued by Europeans. Before a reply could return, de Soto fell seriously ill and took to his bed. Quigualtum sent back a message that astonished and infuriated de Soto: Angered by the chief's arrogant response but by then too weak to get up from his bed, de Soto could not mount an armed response. Afterward followed a period with Anilco and other local towns conspiring with Quigualtum to mount a combined attack against the Spaniards. In order to strike fear into Quigualtum and the others, and to punish Anilco, from his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all of the men of Anilco. His men obeyed and did not stop with killing the men; they were said to have massacred women and children as well. DeSoto died of his illness a few days later in May 1542, in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day McArthur, Arkansas. His body was weighted down with sand and under cover of darkness consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River. In order to keep the ruse up and forestall possible attacks, his men informed the local peoples that de Soto had ascended into the sky but would return. His remaining men, now commanded by his aide de camp Moscoso, decided to attempt an overland journey to Mexico in order to avoid sailing downriver. They made it as far as Texas, meeting Late Caddoan Mississippian peoples along the way, before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition had to backtrack to Guachoya. =1543 : Mississippi River battle= Small prehistoric canoe on display at the Winterville onsite museum They spent the winter of 1542-1543 building a small fleet of seven \\"bergantines\\", or pinnaces, to attempt the river route to the Gulf of Mexico and on to Mexico. Once the spring floods had abated, they headed down the Mississippi River on July 2, 1543. After sailing for several days, the expedition came upon a great fleet of over one hundred war canoes. Made from enormous hollowed-out cypress logs, the larger canoes were big enough to seat 60 to 70 passengers. They had ranks of seated paddlers, 20-30 per side, with a standing warrior armed with bow and arrows stationed between each one. Some of the larger canoes were also color coded, with the canoes, oars, and the clothing and weaponry of the crew all painted the same color. Although many of the canoes were not this large, their crews still moved with precision, speed, and skill. Seated in several of the great canoes were the fleet commanders, chiefs with awnings to shade and protect them from the sun, one of them possibly Quigualtam himself. Under the pretense of negotiating, the canoes attacked the Spanish. Over the course of the running battle, eleven Spaniards were killed and many more wounded as the expedition fled downstream. The war canoe crews chanted war songs, whose rhythm and speed set the speed of the paddling of their craft. The songs glorified their prowess in battle and extolled their courage. The songs also lambasted the Spaniards as cowards and thieves who would soon perish; that on land their corpses had been food for dogs and birds and that on the river they would feed the fish. The songs frequently mentioned the name of their great chief Quigualtam and ,at the end of each song, the singers would give a great shout of triumph. The Spaniards no longer had long-range offensive weapons. The gunpowder for their arquebuses had run out long before and the guns melted down to make nails for the boats; the limited number of crossbows had mostly stopped working as well. The Spaniards placed their armor and cane matting around the boats gunwales to protect from the arrows. The Native Americans began arcing their arrows into the air so they came straight down and injured more of the Spaniards. The fleet chased them for several days, rarely letting up on their attack on the Spaniards. On the third day, the Spanish reached the edge of their attackers' territory. The war fleet turned around and headed back upriver, continuing to chant and shout the name of their leader. Within a day the expedition encountered another fleet of canoes belonging to a powerful but unnamed chiefdom. These warriors also gave chase downriver for several days until the foreigners had left their territory. After one more encounter with a small native group near the coast, the expedition finally made it to the Gulf on July 16, 1543, a few weeks after they had left Guachoya. Proposed identifications Holly Bluff Site Winterville Site, near Greenville, Mississippi Various scholars have proposed and debated the identities of Quigualtam and the unnamed chiefdom and the exact locations of their polities. Historian Charles M. Hudson has suggested that Quigualtam was centered on the area surrounding the Holly Bluff or Winterville Sites in the lower Yazoo Basin. Archeologists believe that these two large Plaquemine culture sites had been abandoned by this time; the capital of the polity had probably shifted to another of the numerous sites within its territory. Other scholars have proposed the Glass Site and Emerald Mound as possibilities for the two polities. The Glass Site is on the flood plain between the Mississippi River and the Natchez Bluffs, approximately south of modern Vicksburg. It was on the northern edge of the Emerald Phase (1500 ‚Äì 1680) of the protohistoric Natchez chiefdom. During this period, its capital was located at the massive Emerald Mound near modern-day Stanton, Mississippi. These two sites were the only major ceremonial centers on this stretch of the Mississippi River occupied during the protohistoric period from 1500 to 1650 CE. Since the Spaniards never made it ashore to leave archaeological evidence of contact with these two groups, their exact identity will probably never be determined with certainty. No further recorded European contact with the indigenous people in this area occurred for almost 140 years, until the first French explorers reached the area in the 1680s. By the historic period, power had shifted within the Natchez polity from Emerald Mound to the Grand Village of the Natchez, and the Glass Site had also been abandoned. In the meantime native peoples of the region suffered from epidemics of infectious disease. They contracted these from members of the de Soto expedition, among whom the diseases were endemic, and indirectly from other Native Americans who had contact with European traders on the Gulf coast. The Spaniards' technique of using local rivalries to their advantage had upset the delicate political balance between native groups, who had existed in a state of low-level endemic warfare between polities for generations. In addition, a series of disastrous multi-year droughts spanned the latter half of the 16th century. Many societies in the region began to collapse. Remnant populations of Mississippian peoples began migrating across and down the Mississippi, sometimes settling in areas recently deserted by Plaquemine peoples, and at other times displacing or merging with the Plaquemine populations on the lower river. The Plaquemine culture contracted southward and abandoned the northern Natchez Bluffs altogether. The Lower Yazoo basin region, once occupied by the Winterville and Holly Bluff polity, became the territory of the historic period Yazoo, Tunica and Koroa tribes. They had migrated from further upriver, thought by archaeologists to be the descendants of Quizquiz and other polities encountered by de Soto in the Memphis area, who were escaping the destruction of their societies left in de Soto's wake. The Tioux and Grigra divisions of the Natchez were recent additions, also Tunica speakers from up the river who had been adopted into the Natchez tribe.

It is a family business that has been in the Tanimura and Antle families since its founding in 1982.  History  George Tanimura was born in San Juan Bautista, California, on July 2, 1915. He was the oldest of twelve siblings, and began working in his family's Castroville, California, iceberg lettuce fields while in grade school. He took over as the head of his family and its business as a teenager when his father died in the midst of the Great Depression. He and his brothers built a large business. Then they lost all their land and property when he and other family members were sent to an Arizonan internment camp during World War II due to his Japanese ancestry, even as his brothers fought for the U.S. overseas. It was there that he met and married his wife. Following the war, Tanimura and his brothers rebuilt the family business, starting as field laborers on small plots of land in Gilroy, California. They saved enough to buy an acre of land and rebuilt their business. By the late 1940s, Tanimura and his brothers began working with grower-shipper Bud Antle, and eventually began growing exclusively for that company. Bud Antle, born in 1914, began farming lettuce in the Salinas Valley under the Bud Antle brand name. In 1972, after Bud Antle died at age 58, Bud's son Bob became chief executive officer of the Antle businesses. Following six years of further development, the Antle businesses merged with Castle & Cooke (now Dole Food Co. Inc.) and he joined its upper management. Bob served on the Castle & Cooke board of directors until 1982. After his departure in 1982, Bob, along with his sons, Rick and Mike, formed Tanimura & Antle with George Tanimura and his brothers, Charlie, Johnny, Tommy, and Bob, and nephews Gary and Keith. George and Bob Tanimura and Bob Antle became co-chairmen of the board. With the death of Bob Antle, his son Rick Antle assumed the position of CEO. Rick Antle was President of Tanimura & Antle since its inception, and became CEO in 2003. He was also associated with Salad Time LLC, Earthbound Farm, LLC, Ready Pac Produce, Inc., Dulcinea Farms LLC and Pacific Ag Rentals. Rick Antle was a graduate of California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and was designated a Distinguished Alumnus by the University's Department of Agriculture.

In 2015, to address an acute shortage of farm workers, Tanimura & Antle embarked on a program to provide employee housing for its workers, beginning with a $17 million expenditure for new housing for year- round employees at the old company town of Spreckels. Tanimura & Antle is pursuing reductions in labor in the fields through the use of computerized/automated planting, thinning and weeding equipment. In February 2017, Tanimura & Antle launched an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), allowing employees to become partial owners of the company.  Operations  Tanimura & Antle owns 27,000 acres and farms 40,000 acres with its partners annually throughout its growing locations in California and Arizona. A hydroponic operation is located in Tennessee. Tanimura & Antle focuses on salad produce, primarily lettuce, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, and green onions.  Library  The Tanimura & Antle Family Memorial Library on the California State University, Monterey Bay campus is a donation from Bob Antle. The library serves as the centerpiece for this developing campus on the former grounds of Fort Ord. It serves as the social and intellectual hub of the university.

Australia and China are the two countries in the world where plagues of mice are known to occur. Mouse plagues occur in southern and eastern Australia usually in the grain-growing regions around every four years. Aggregating around food sources during plagues, the density of mice can reach up to 3,000 mice per hectare. An early localised plague of mice occurred around Walgett in New South Wales in 1871. In 1872 another plague was recorded near Saddleworth in South Australia with farmers ploughing the soil to destroy mice nests. In 1880 a plague of mice was noted along an area of the Goulburn River. South Australia experienced another plague in 1890 in the Mid North region in areas around Oladdie, Mundoora and Georgetown. In 1904 further plagues occurred in parts of New South Wales including Condobolin and other parts of the Lachlan River and around Moree, New South Wales extending all the way to coastal areas. The plague of 1917 was one of the largest mouse plagues in Australia that occurred on and around the Darling Downs area of Queensland, areas around Beulah, Campbells Creek and Willenabrina in Victoria and parts of South Australia including Balaklava Eventually mice reached the Goldfields-Esperance and Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia. Plagues of mice have been occurring ever since with increasing frequency. More incidences of plagues occurred in 1918 in parts of Victoria and New South Wales. In 1922 areas around Dubbo, New South Wales and Tamworth in New South Wales were hit again followed by more plagues through the Riverina in 1925. Mice struck again in 1928 in parts of Queensland around Warwick Further plagues occurred around Wimmera in Victoria, Loxton in South Australia and Winton in Queensland in 1931 and more recorded in parts of New South Wales in 1932 including Culgoa and Parkes. The next plague hit areas around Warracknabeal and Hopetoun in Victoria but was less intense than the 1932 plagues. In 1952 parts of Victoria and South Australia were struck by mouse plagues. Areas in New South Wales and Queensland were hit by mouse plagues in 1955. In 1956 parts of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia experienced the worst mouse plague the area had known. Parts of outback New South Wales around Bourke were hit by plagues of mice in 1967. In 1972 parts of Queensland were hit by mouse plagues as were parts of Victoria and New South Wales in 1975. A plague in Victoria in 1979 cost farmers 15 million in lost crops and damaged machinery. the plagues continued into 1980. Australia's worst ever mouse plague occurred in 1993 and caused an estimated 96 million worth of damage to crops and attacked livestock in piggeries and poultry farms. They also destroyed rubber and electrical insulation, damaged farm vehicles, and ruined cars and buildings. Another plague occurred in 1994 affecting parts of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory South Australia and northern Victoria. Mouse numbers built to plague numbers in early 2011 in southern Queensland, through New South Wales, western Victoria and South Australia spreading to the Nullarbor Plain region of Western Australia in late 2011.

Lacking the fuel to do this, the aircraft landed at Helsinki Airport, Finland, where the hijackers kept hostages to demand that the Finnish authorities refuel the aircraft and provide it with a new crew. The hijackers fell asleep, however, and the hostages escaped. Without this bargaining power, the hijackers surrendered and were extradited back to the Soviet Union, where they were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.  Incident  The Tu-134 departed Petrozavodsk Airport on 10 July 1977 with a passenger complement of approximately seventy and an intended destination of Leningrad-Pulkovo Airport. Partway through the flight, however, the aircraft was commandeered by 19-year-old Alexandr Zagirnjak and 22-year- old Gennadi Sheludko. The two had smuggled guns and what appeared to be a grenade on board, though it was later revealed to be a non-explosive training grenade, and demanded that the crew fly it to Stockholm. As the aircraft did not have the fuel to travel over the Baltic Sea to the Swedish capital, the crew were forced to divert to Helsinki Airport, Finland. Upon landing, the hijackers released all of the crew and a significant number of its passengers. The remainder, which reportedly included at least seven children for some period of time, were held back as hostages. Zagirnjak and Sheludko hoped to use them as leverage to get Finnish authorities to refuel the aircraft, replace the Soviet crew, and allow them to fly to their original destination. This plan was foiled, however, when Zagirnjak and Sheludko fell asleep, which allowed the remaining hostages to escape. Lacking bargaining power, the hijackers surrendered not long after. The Finnish government returned them to the Soviet Union three days later, complying with a unique anti-hijacking treaty they had signed with the Soviets in 1974. Sheludko, who had a previous criminal record for theft, would eventually be sentenced to fifteen years; Zagirnjak received eight. The incident came as part of a recent increase in airliner hijacking. The Washington Post reported that it was the third such crime in a week, with the others occurring in the Middle East and South America, and that the last successful hijacking of a Soviet aircraft had been only two months earlier.

The original Colossal tree and its pollinizer were planted in approximately 1888-1890 by Benjamin Tonella in Nevada City, California Nave, Michael, Some More Thoughts on the Colossal, The Western Chestnut, Vol 2 Number 3, Summer 2000 The most likely source for the trees was The Barren Hill Nursery of Felix Gillet. Gillet imported some of the best French chestnut cultivars and also imported an assortment of Japanese chestnuts. Gillet died in 1908 and the nursery was bought by C. E. Parsons. Parsons introduced the Colossal chestnut commercially in 1925. In 2000, the original ‚ÄòColossal‚Äô tree was over tall, with a spread of over and a trunk circumference approaching . Culture Colossal tree growth is vigorous but the wood is somewhat weak. Reportedly, heavily loaded spreading branches can break under high burr load or in strong wind Colossal Washington Chestnut Company, accessed Jan 2018 For almost all American commercial chestnut growers the Colossal chestnut tree is the producer of the largest nuts and the most nuts. Colossal orchards require interspersed planting of pollenizers. Results from wind-pollination and hand-pollination experiments in Michigan strongly suggest that the highest Colossal nut production is achieved when pollen is available at anthesis. Anthesis in mid- Michigan is generally between late-June and early-July.Medina-Mora, Carmen et al STUDIES TO DETERMINE PHENOLOGY AND POLLINATION IN THE EUROPEAN X JAPANESE HYBRID CV. ‚ÄòCOLOSSAL‚Äô IN MICHIGAN ORCHARDS 6th International Chestnut Symposium October 9‚Äì13, 2017, accessed 2018 Grafted trees may start producing at a young age within the first few years of transplanting.

Colossal nuts have occurrence of double or triple embryos per nut. The pellicle (skin) of the nuts is thick. Fresh refrigerated nuts should be consumed within 90 days because Colossal nuts do not store well. The taste of Colossal nuts is average with high sucrose content.Warmund MR, et al. Descriptive sensory analysis and free sugar contents of chestnut cultivars grown in North America J Sci Food Agric. 2011. accessed 2018 There are other cultivars, where chestnuts rank higher in taste tests. In the California central valley, under ideal conditions, Colossal orchards can produce of nuts per acre. Due to early bud break, late spring frosts can cause damage on early leaves and buds.

The Lamb vector is defined as :\\\\mathbf l = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{u} where \\\\mathbf{u} is the velocity field and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}= abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{u} is the vorticity field of the flow.

In irrotational flow, Lamb vector is zero, as in Beltrami flow. The concept of Lamb vector is widely used in turbulent flows. The Lamb vector is analogous to electric field, when the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation is compared with Maxwell's equations. Properties of Lamb vector The divergence of the lamb vector can be derived from vector identities, : abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf l = \\\\mathbf u\\\\cdot abla\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega -\\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol\\\\omega. At the same time, the divergence can also be obtained from Navier‚ÄìStokes equation by taking its divergence.

It premiered on Fox Family on July 25, 1999. It is based on the 1989 novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. Plot Jeff Corrigan (Patrick Duffy) is a dutiful CFO of an international corporation who knows too many secrets: His boss, Eric Loftin (Dominic Raacke), has been using the books to hide illegal activities, relying on Jeff to keep everything quiet. However, fitted with a wire and carrying a disc full of evidence, Jeff leaves the office one afternoon prepared to ruin Loftin with the FBI's assistance; led by agent Ellie Foster (Anne Marie Loder), the law enforcement team moves in and arrests Loftin, but not before he threatens Jeff's estranged family. Foster immediately secures Jeff's wife Liz (Pam Dawber), daughter April (Tanja Reichert) and son Bram (David Kaye), keeping them secluded without any outside contact. This all comes as a surprise to the family since Jeff never told them he had been working in cahoots with the FBI. Loftin escapes, and along with his colleagues, spends his energy on finding the Corrigans and wiping them out. The victims move from hotel to hotel until they are eventually placed in a relocation program, forced to become one big happy unit while assuming a new identity. April, who will do anything to see her boyfriend again, runs away and risks everyone's safety. Forced to emerge in order to save her, Jeff confronts Loftin in a final showdown.

Designed by NBBJ and landscape firm Site Workshop, the three glass domes are covered in pentagonal hexecontahedron panels and serve as an employee lounge and workspace. The spheres, which range from three to four stories tall, house 40,000 plants as well as meeting space and retail stores. They are located under the Day 1 building on Lenora Street. The complex opened to Amazon employees and limited public access on January 30, 2018. The spheres are reserved mainly for Amazon employees, but are open to the public through weekly headquarters tours and an exhibit on the ground floor. Design Common area and coffee shop in the central sphere The spheres are located along Lenora Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, under Day 1 in Amazon's Seattle headquarters campus. The three intersecting spherical domes range from in height and take up half of a city block. They use over 2,600 panes of glass and of steel, arranged with five-sided panels of a pentagonal hexecontahedron. The largest sphere, in the center, is four stories tall and has of space; it houses the cafeteria, stairway, elevators, and bathrooms. The stairwell shaft is covered by a four-story \\"living wall\\" with 25,000 plants, including carnivorous species from Asia. The spheres have meeting spaces, tables, and benches that can seat a total of 800 people. The complex, nicknamed \\"Bezos' balls\\" by the media, has become a recognizable landmark and tourist attraction for the Denny Triangle area since the beginning of its construction. The structure has been compared to the city's iconic Space Needle, built as a futuristic landmark for the Century 21 Exposition in 1962. It was designed with influences from biophilic design, incorporating nature into the built environment. Flora The spheres have 40,000 plants from 50 countries and are divided into three areas, with the western and eastern domes segregated into the Old World and New World. The domes are kept at a temperature of and 60 percent humidity during the daytime. Amazon employed a full-time horticulturalist to grow the building's 40,000 plants over a three-year period at a greenhouse in Redmond. Amazon donated space in the greenhouse to the University of Washington's botany program during renovation of their Life Sciences Building in 2016. Among the 40 to 50 trees in the spheres, the largest is a Ficus rubiginosa tree, nicknamed \\"Rubi\\", which was lifted into the spheres by a crane in June 2017. An Amorphophallus titanum corpse flower named \\"Morticia\\" bloomed for 48 hours in October 2018, attracting 5,000 visitors to the Spheres as Amazon opened the facility to public viewing for a limited time. A taller corpse flower, named Bellatrix, bloomed in June 2019 and prompted another public viewing that attracted large crowds. History The eastern sphere's steel structure seen in August 2016, during glass installation Amazon began planning a large Seattle headquarters campus in the early 2010s, acquiring three blocks in the Denny Triangle area in 2012. The original design for the second tower included a six-story building with flexible workspaces and a meeting center, but was later changed to a spherical conservatory. The revised design by NBBJ, which had been in development since 2012, was unveiled in May 2013 to a mixed reaction from the city's project design review board. While hailed as a bold design, it was criticized for the lack of rain protection, public access, and the amount of energy needed to climatize the facility. In August, NBBJ released an updated design that replaced the supporting steel structures under the glass with organic forms called \\"Catalan spheres\\". The city's design review board approved the design in October 2013, after slight changes to the understructure were made. Construction on the spheres began in 2015, and the first pieces of the steel structure were erected in February 2016. The steel was painted white and covered with glass panels that were installed beginning in April. The first plant, an Australian tree fern, was moved from the Redmond greenhouse and planted in May 2017. The spheres were dedicated on January 29, 2018, by Jeff Bezos, Mayor Jenny Durkan, County Executive Dow Constantine, and Governor Jay Inslee. Bezos ceremonially opened the complex using an Alexa voice command. It opened to Amazon employees the following day, along with a public exhibit named the \\"Understory\\" below the spheres. Public access is provided as part of weekly guided tours of the Amazon headquarters campus and a twice-monthly weekend reservation program.

He stood several times for the Wellington City Council as a Labour candidate in 1965, 1968 and a 1969 by-election. While generally polling well he never won a seat. =Death= Hill died in Wellington in 2001. Personal life Hill's first marriage was to Jean O'Hagan Morton, an author who published three novels and a collection of writings all under the name Jean O. Hill. They had three daughters, Rowena, Beatrice and Theodora. His daughter Beatrice Tinsley had a notable career as an astronomer and cosmologist in the United States, where she was renowned as one of the world's greatest astrophysicists, but died prematurely in 1981 at the age of 40.

IEC Common Data Dictionary (abbreviated: IEC CDD) is a metadata registry based on the data model defined in IEC 61360-2/ISO 13584-42 with an enhancement of its modelling capability adopted from IEC 62656-1. The description of the data model for dictionary developers in particular for those in electrotechnical domains is given in IEC 61360-1. Currently the scope of the registry is extended to cover all ISO and IEC domains, thus it is no longer \\"IEC CDD\\", nevertheless it is hosted by IEC-CO and is maintained by IEC SC 3D with a joint working group formed between IEC SC 3D and ISO TC 184/SC4. The data model of the CDD references ISO/IEC 11179 for the identification of the registered elements . It is used to host product classifications. - This means the IEC CDD is a database providing classifications and metadata definitions for describing products. The IEC CDD is an International Standard in the form of an online database, not in the form of (e-)paper, and is given the standard number IEC 61360-4 DB. Thus the metadata registered into the database has the status of International Standard. The procedure to add a new definition or a set of definitions is based on the IEC database procedure, described in Annex SL of the IEC supplementary of the ISO/IEC directive Part 1. This process for updating the content is called a \\"Change Request\\" and when a Change Request is issued and adopted, the proposed item will become part of the International Standard, IEC 61360-4 DB, within approximately 6 months.  Use  IEC CDD originally was intended to support electronic exchange of digital information (e.g. for e-commerce ). The exchanged information is based on concepts, which are standardized as a common basis. New information concepts related to smart manufacturing and Industrie 4.0 are based on use of IEC CDD and similar dictionaries. The intention for these use cases is to provide the meaning of data values by referencing the data definitions in the dictionaries. Such annotated data values then can be exchanged within one production system between machines of different manufacturers or between different companies.  Scope  The data specification for IEC CDD is provided by IEC 61360. This means IEC CDD stores concepts which are based on IEC 61360, such as * Uniquely identified classes and properties, and their relations; * Uniquely identified values and value lists; * terminology and definitions based on accepted international standards; * technical representation of concepts including units and data types and their identification. The representation of a product and its features is based on a hierarchy of classes. The characteristics of the product are represented with help of the property definitions related to the classes. Such property definitions may be based on general datatypes or based on specific values and value lists (e.g. for defining a supported range). Each class and each property may be defined with name and textual descriptions in multiple languages. Such a definition for a property representation can be used as base for product descriptions in e-catalogues or for B2B communications (see B2B e-commerce).  Content  Selection of the domain to be displayed in the overview page. (Shows the currently publicly available domains.) The IEC CDD hosts different product classifications (based on international standards) for * process automation equipment (based on IEC 61987), * low voltage switchgear and controlgear (based on IEC 62683), * electro-electronic components (provided by IEC TC47), * optics (based on ISO 23584, test), * measuring instruments (based on IEC ISO 13584-501, test), * environmental declaration (based on IEC 60721, test). The IEC CDD is organized into different domains, each domain providing one of these product classifications. Each of these domains can be accessed directly using the HTML user interface of IEC CDD. The IEC CDD also hosts UNITS for MEASUREMENT (based on IEC 62720). These units are hosted in a domain which cannot be accessed directly by the HTML user interface, but which can be referenced by the product classifications listed above (for example it is referenced by the product classification for electro-electronic components).  Procedure to introduce new information into IEC CDD  The procedure to integrate new concepts is defined by \\"ISO/IEC directives supplement ‚Äì Procedures specific to IEC\\", Annex SL. In order to provide new content or improvement of the content of IEC CDD, a Change Request (CR) may be submitted to IEC SC3D. The CR is reviewed by SC3D experts for syntactic correctness and completeness. After that, during Evaluation stage the CR will be checked for correctness of formal definitions according to the definition rules as defined by ISO/IEC directives Part 2, as well as syntactic and semantic consistency. After these checks the CR is voted to reach Validation stage.

Contributions in Structural Biology  Sujata Sharma was the first structural biologist to successfully demonstrate the proteolytic production of N- and C-terminal molecular halves of Lactoferrin, crystallize the C-lobe and determine the three-dimensional structure Her studies have established the fact that lactoferrin has a direct role in chelating the unbound non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which in turn leads to the reduction in the NSAID-induced gastropathy . The studies on the structure determination of Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein which is a component of the innate immune system and are conserved from insects to mammals, have given a new direction for the development of this protein as a natural protein antibiotic . The structural studies on the lactoperoxidase system, that is, lactoperoxidase along with its inorganic ion substrates, hydrogen peroxide, and oxidized products have given new insights into the structure-function interrelationships of this antimicrobial protein . Her structural studies on SPX-40 have demonstrated that the molecule acts as a protective signalling factor for breast cancer cells and have validated this protein as a drug target for breast cancer. She has also been involved in the designing of inhibitors, both small organic and inorganic compounds and peptides, against these protein targets. She has successfully demonstrated the potency of these ligands in several animal models.

The game was originally released in 2016 on OUYA and ForgeTV, and was later ported to the Nintendo Switch. With the announcement of the Nintendo Switch, the team decided to port and enhance the game for the new console. The game was released on Nintendo Switch on February 6, 2018.  Gameplay  In a top-down view the player must dodge and destroy enemies while collecting pickups they drop. Black Hole is a twin-stick shooter in space where the player flies through different black holes in a top-down view and fights numerous enemies located inside the black hole. Choosing one of the ships the player starts off with very little weapon power. Through pickups that the enemies drop the ship can be upgraded between each completed level to enhance the primary weapon, unlock a secondary weapon and other various ship upgrades. At the end of each black hole after several levels there is a boss fight.  Features  The game consists of 40 levels across 4 themed black holes or worlds. There are 4 different worlds, mechanical, fire, ice, and beast. The player may choose one of three possible spaceships which can be upgraded in between each level. The game contains 3 difficulty levels and features time and score leaderboards for each of them. Multiple achievements can be unlocked which don't have any influence on the game. In the Nintendo Switch version, a colorblind mode and speedrun mode was added, which changed the differently colored pickups into more readable letters. The game also integrates HD Rumble, a fully playable touchscreen mode, and also the possibility to play with motion controls or the IR camera, both of which are not meant as the main way of input but more of a fun way to play the game.  Reception  The early reviews state that, while not bringing much new to the shoot 'em up genre, it is still a solid single player game that fits well on the Nintendo Switch.

It has one of the tallest minarets in the city and overlooks Place R'cif in the heart of the medina.  Location and name  The mosque is located just west of Place R'cif, a large public square created in the 20th century(Information indicated on official signage at Place R'cif.) to provide easier access to the interior of the medina (it is one of the only places inside the medina that can be reached by car). Its name means \\"Mosque of the Paved Road\\". It was built on a cliffside along the shore of the Bou Khareb River (Oued Bou Khareb) which passes through the center of the city, though the river is now hidden underground between Place R'Cif and the south edge of the city. The mosque is also near the central souqs (markets) of the city, stretching downhill from the Qarawiyyin area.  History = Construction = The mosque was built in the 18th century during the reign of the Alaouite sultan Moulay Slimane (1792-1822). (Although one author attributes it to the reign of Moulay Mohammed bin Abdallah between 1757 and 1790.) It is recorded that Moulay Slimane commissioned two marble fountains and a marble water basin which were placed in the mosque's courtyard (sahn) in 1797. The sultan's architect in charge of these works as al-Hassan al-Soudani. = Role in 1937 protests = The mosque was a prominent rallying point during the riots and protests that occurred across multiple Moroccan cities in late 1937 against the French Protectorate authorities. The protests were sparked by food shortages which threatened local tribes, dispossessed of their best lands by the French, with starvation. They were exacerbated by the French authorities' violent suppression of protests in Meknes (near Fes), killing 13 people and injuring more. Not long after, protests spread to Fes. Crowds of demonstrators used the R'cif and Qarawiyyin Mosques as gathering points before marching out into the city, with 1500 marching from the R'cif mosque alone. On October 28, French authorities sent troops to occupy the entire medina, including the mosques. This resulted in a confrontation inside the mosque during which 6 people were injured by grenades thrown by French troops. Order was eventually reestablished soon after, but the protests were one of the pivotal points in the evolution the Moroccan nationalist movement, which transitioned from a reformist agenda to demands for independence.  Architecture  The mosque occupies an area of roughly 1500 square meters. The mosque features one of the tallest minarets in the old city, making it very prominent on the skyline, especially from the south. The minaret has a square base and is decorated simply with bands of green faience. The main gate of the mosque opens on its west side, facing a small public square. It is decorated with a carved geometric pattern inside a square frame, typical of the Almohad and Marinid architectural legacies, filled with predominantly green tiles decorated with arabesques and small areas of mosaic tiles (zellij). Above the gate is an ornately carved wooden canopy, likely of cedar, also typical of Moroccan architecture, and further above and behind rises the minaret of the mosque. Inside the mosque is a wide courtyard (sahn) surrounded by arcaded galleries, at the center of is a rectangular water basin (to aid in ablutions) under a small roofed pavilion. On the east side of the courtyard is a large roofed prayer hall marked by rows of horseshoe arches. This overall layout is similar to other Moroccan mosques. The mihrab is also very traditional, consisting of an alcove with a horseshoe arch resting on engaged columns of marble (reused from Saadian monuments), surrounded by carved stucco decoration of typical Moroccan arabesque motifs and calligraphic inscriptions, highlighted with painted colours. In addition to being a Friday mosque (i.e. a large mosque that accommodates Friday prayers and hosts a khutba), it also hosted a small library of books for use in the mosque. The mosque also had a public street fountain to offer water to local residents.  Gallery  File:29612-Fez (27595871294).jpgR'cif Mosque seen from the south.

The school's building phase was completed in 1881. History In the 19th century, new types of schools began to appear in Azerbaijan. During this period, there was only one main school in Baku, and one classical gymnasium in Ganja. This changed after the demand for education in the region grew, two schools were no longer sufficient thus prompting the population of the city to appeal to the Petersburg-Caucasian committee. The appeal stated: The efforts of the local population led to the foundation of the school in Shusha on September 20, 1881. After the first years of the school's opening, 159 pupils were enrolled in the school, consisting of preparatory classes and three main classes, 58 of the students were Azerbaijani, 91 were Armenian, whilst the other 10 were student from other nationalities. In 1886, 7,500 manats were spent on the school. In 1890, a representative of the Caucasian Ministry of education brought Ziaaddovla Anishir…ôvan, Mirza Qajar, and anthropologist Shantr. This arrival peaked the interest of the students, which lowered the percentage of absence at the school to 7.64%. The school was an open-minded establishment which promoted the acquisition of languages other than Azerbaijani. In 1890, contrary to the Tbilisi schools, German was not forced upon the students, but the choice to learn it was made available. Mirza Salah bey Zohrabbeyov, Yusif bey Malikhaqnazarov, Hashim bey Vazirov, were part of the well-known educators of the time, who taught in the School. The two famous Azerbaijani writers Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev and Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli were amongst the students who enrolled at the Shusha Realni School.
