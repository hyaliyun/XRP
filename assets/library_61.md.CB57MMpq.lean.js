Decisions were made in the king's name by the Regency Council, which was made up of the most important and influential people in the government of England, and dominated by the king's uncle Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (brother of the king's father and predecessor, Henry V) and Bishop (Cardinal from 1426) Henry Beaufort (Gloucester's half-uncle). The individuals who constituted the Regency Council as at 9 December 1422 were : * John, Duke of Bedford * Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester * Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter * Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester * Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury * John Kemp, Bishop of London * Philip Morgan, Bishop of Worcester * John Wakering, Bishop of Norwich * Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland * Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland * John Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk * Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March * Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick * Henry FitzHugh, 3rd Baron FitzHugh * Sir John Tiptoft * Ralph Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell * Sir Walter Hungerford * Sir Walter Beauchamp Although the nominal leadership of the regency lay with John, Duke of Bedford (Gloucester's older brother), he spent most of his time ruling the English territories in France. Gloucester thus took the post of Lord Protector of the Realm in order to rule England while Bedford was absent. In practice, however, he was forced to share power with Cardinal Henry Beaufort, who held the position of Lord Chancellor and led a regency council composed of England's prominent magnates. Much of the period was marked by quarrels and disputes between Gloucester and the cardinal. Tensions between both parties could be seen in events such as the Parliament of Bats. The Council soon split along lines of opposition and support to the continuation of the war in France. Gloucester had always been fervently in favour of finishing the war his brother had started in France and seeing it through to victory at any price. However, in the face of a resurgent French army led by Joan of Arc and the crowning of the Dauphin as Charles VII in 1429, it became clear that the French were gaining the upper hand and slowly expelling the English from their country. A peace party emerged led by Cardinal Beaufort, who saw the war as a drain on resources and unwinnable. However, for most of the period the regency council was able to govern effectively and fairly. The splits became most evident towards the end. In 1432, Anne of Burgundy died; she was the younger sister of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. Anne had been the wife of John, Duke of Bedford, and their marriage was instrumental in maintaining the alliance between England and Burgundy against France. However, following her death, Bedford married Jacquetta of Luxembourg, which the Duke of Burgundy disapproved of and Burgundy made peace with France. With the loss of the alliance with Burgundy, Bedford became convinced that peace was the only solution, but at a conference arranged in Arras in 1435, the English delegation refused to give up their claim to the French throne. Bedford died just after the conference and was replaced with Richard, Duke of York who did not favour the peace policy. When Henry finally came of age in 1437, he took over at just about the worst time possible, when splits about the war and rivalries between the various nobles were at their deepest. The Crown had suffered huge war debts, and there was general lack of leadership in the French territories which seemed to be slipping slowly but surely out of English hands.

No. 51-2640, 781st Troop Carrier Squadron / 465th Troop Carrier Wing. AC-119G gunship The Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar (Navy and Marine Corps designation R4Q) was an American military transport aircraft developed from the World War II-era Fairchild C-82 Packet, designed to carry cargo, personnel, litter patients, and mechanized equipment, and to drop cargo and troops by parachute. The first C-119 made its initial flight in November 1947, and by the time production ceased in 1955, more than 1,100 C-119s had been built. Its cargo-hauling ability and unusual twin-boom design earned it the nickname \\"Flying Boxcar\\". Development The Air Force C-119 and Navy R4Q was initially a redesign of the earlier C-82 Packet, built between 1945 and 1948. The Packet provided service to the Air Force's Tactical Air Command and Military Air Transport Service for nearly nine years during which time its design was found to have several serious problems. All of these were addressed in the C-119. In contrast to the C-82, the cockpit was moved forward to fit flush with the nose rather than its previous location over the cargo compartment. This resulted in more usable cargo space and larger loads than the C-82 could accommodate. The C-119 also featured more powerful engines, and a wider and stronger airframe. The first C-119 prototype (called the XC-82B) first flew in November 1947, with deliveries of C-119Bs from Fairchild's Hagerstown, Maryland factory beginning in December 1949.Swanborough and Bowers 1963, pp. 262‚Äì263. In 1951, Henry J. Kaiser was awarded a contract to assemble additional C-119s at the Kaiser-Frazer automotive factory located in the former B-24 plant at Willow Run Airport in Belleville, Michigan. Initially, the Kaiser-built C-119F differed from the Fairchild aircraft by the use of Wright R-3350-85 Duplex Cyclone engines in place of Fairchild's use of the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial engine. Kaiser built 71 C-119s at Willow Run in 1952 and 1953 (AF Ser. No. 51-8098 to 51-8168) before converting the factory for a planned production of the Chase C-123 that never eventuated. The Kaiser sub-contract was frowned upon by Fairchild, and efforts were made through political channels to stop Kaiser's production, which may have proven successful. Following Kaiser's termination of C-119 production the contract for the C-123 was instead awarded to Fairchild. Most Kaiser-built aircraft were issued to the U.S. Marine Corps as R4Qs, with several later turned over to the South Vietnamese air force in the 1970s. The AC-119G \\"Shadow\\" gunship variant was fitted with four six- barrel 7.62√ó51mm NATO miniguns, armor plating, flare launchers, and night- capable infrared equipment. Like the AC-130 that preceded it, the AC-119 proved to be a potent weapon. The AC-119 was made more deadly by the introduction of the AC-119K \\"Stinger\\" version, which featured the addition of two General Electric M61 Vulcan 20 mm cannon, improved avionics, and two underwing-mounted General Electric J85-GE-17 turbojet engines, adding nearly of thrust. Other major variants included the EC-119J, used for satellite tracking, and the YC-119H Skyvan prototype, with larger wings and tail. In civilian use, many C-119s feature the \\"Jet-Pack\\" modification, which incorporates a Westinghouse J34 turbojet engine in a nacelle above the fuselage. =Production= Number built: 1,183 consisting of: *1,112 built by Fairchild *71 built by Kaiser-Frazer Corp Two additional airframes were built by Fairchild for static tests Operational history 403rd TCW C-119s drop the 187th RCT over Korea, 1952. C-119 in flight The aircraft saw extensive action during the Korean War as a troop and equipment transport. Two months later, the C-119 deployed with the 314th Troop Carrier Group and served in Korea throughout the war.Lloyd 2005, pp. 55, 165. In December 1950, after People's Republic of China Expeditionary People's Volunteer Army troops blew up a bridge at a narrow point on the evacuation route between Koto-ri and Hungnam, blocking the withdrawal of U.N. forces, eight U.S. Air Force C-119 Flying Boxcars flown by the 314th Troop Carrier Group. were used to drop portable bridge sections by parachute. The bridge, consisting of eight separate sixteen-foot long, 2,900-pound sections, was dropped one section at a time, using two parachutes on each section. Four of these sections, together with additional wooden extensions were successfully reassembled into a replacement bridge by Marine Corps combat engineers and the US Army 58th Engineer Treadway Bridge Company, enabling U.N. forces to reach Hungnam. From 1951 to 1962, C-119C, F and G models served with U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and Far East Air Forces (FEAF) as the first-line Combat Cargo units, and did yeoman work as freight haulers with the 60th Troop Carrier Wing, the 317th Troop Carrier Wing and the 465th Troop Carrier Wing in Europe, based first in Germany and then in France with roughly 150 aircraft operating anywhere from Greenland to India. A similar number of aircraft served in the Pacific and the Far East. In 1958, the 317th absorbed the 465th, and transitioned to the C-130s, but the units of the former 60th Troop Carrier Wing, the 10th, 11th and 12th Troop Carrier Squadrons, continued to fly C-119s until 1962, the last non-Air Force Reserve and non-Air National Guard operational units to fly the \\"Boxcars.\\" The USAF Strategic Air Command had C-119 Flying Boxcars in service from 1955 to 1973. Perhaps the most remarkable use of the C-119 was the aerial recovery of balloons, UAVs, and even satellites. The first use of this technique was in 1955, when C-119s were used to recover Ryan AQM-34 Firebee unmanned targets. The 456th Troop Carrier Wing, which was attached to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) from 25 April 1955 ‚Äì 26 May 1956, used C-119s to retrieve instrument packages from high-altitude reconnaissance balloons. C-119s from the 6593rd Test Squadron based at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii performed several aerial recoveries of film-return capsules during the early years of the Corona spy satellite program. On 19 August 1960, the recovery by a C-119 of film from the Corona mission code- named Discoverer 14 was the first successful recovery of film from an orbiting satellite and the first aerial recovery of an object returning from Earth orbit.\\"Discoverer 14 ‚Äì NSSDC ID: 1960-010A.\\" NASA. Retrieved: 28 June 2011. The C-119 went on to see extensive service in French Indochina, beginning in 1953 with aircraft secretly loaned by the CIA to French forces for troop support. These aircraft were generally flown in French markings by American CIA pilots often accompanied by French officers and support staff. The C-119 was to play a major role during the siege at Dien Bien Phu, where they flew into increasingly heavy fire while dropping supplies to the besieged French forces.Grandolini 1996, pp. 52‚Äì60. The only two American pilot casualties of the siege at Dien Bien Phu were James B. McGovern Jr. and Wallace A. Buford. Both pilots, together with a French crew member, were killed in early June, 1954, when their C-119, while making an artillery drop, was hit and crippled by Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire; the aircraft then flew an additional into Laos before it crashed. During the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the C-119 was extensively used to supply Indian forces. President Kennedy allowed sales of spare C-119 on a priority basis upon request by the Indian government. During the Vietnam War, the incredible success of the Douglas AC-47 Spooky but limitations of the size and carrying capacity of the plane led the USAF to develop a larger plane to carry more surveillance gear, weaponry, and ammunition, the AC-130 Spectre. However, due to the strong demands of C-130s for cargo use there were not enough Hercules frames to provide Spectres for operations against the enemy. The USAF filled the gap by converting C-119s into AC-119s each equipped with four 7.62 minigun pods, a Xenon searchlight, night observation sight, flare launcher, fire control computer and TRW fire control safety display to prevent incidents of friendly fire. The new AC-119 squadron was given the call-sign \\"Creep\\" that launched a wave of indignation that led the Air Force to change the name to \\"Shadow\\" on 1 December 1968.pp. 213‚Äì214 Chinnery, Philip Any Time, Any Place Airlife Publishing Ltd 1994 C-119Gs were modified as AC-119G Shadows and AC-119K Stingers. They were used successfully in both close air support missions in South Vietnam and interdiction missions against trucks and supplies along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. All the AC-119G Gunships were transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force starting in 1970 as the American forces began to be withdrawn. Fairchild C-119G of the Royal Belgian Air Force in 1965 During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Air National Guard and USAF Reserve pilots flew C-119's to drop parachutist students for the US Army Parachute School at Ft. Benning, Georgia. After retirement from active duty, substantial numbers of C-119s and R4Qs soldiered on in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard until the mid-1970s, the R4Qs also being redesignated as C-119s in 1962. The last military use of the C-119 by the United States ended in 1974 when a single squadron of Navy Reserve C-119s based at Naval Air Facility Detroit/Selfridge Air National Guard Base near Detroit, Michigan, and two squadrons based at Naval Air Station Los Alamitos, California replaced their C-119s with newer aircraft. Many C-119s were provided to other nations as part of the Military Assistance Program, including Belgium, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Italy, Jordan, Taiwan, and (as previously mentioned) South Vietnam. The type was also used by the Royal Canadian Air Force, and by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps under the designation R4Q until 1962 when they were also redesignated as C-119. =Civilian use= jet pod above the fuselage). C-119G instrument panel A number of aircraft were acquired by companies who were contracted by the United States Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management to provide airtankers for fighting wildfires. Others were pressed into civilian cargo service. After a series of crashes, the age and safety of the aircraft being used as airtankers became a serious concern, and the U.S. C-119 airtanker fleet was permanently grounded in 1987. Eventually, many of these aircraft were provided to museums across the U.S. in a complicated ‚Äì and ultimately illegal ‚Äì scheme where stored USAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports and Navy Lockheed P-3 Orion anti-submarine patrol aircraft were provided to the contractors in exchange for the C-119s.\\"United States v. Fuchs\\" U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Appeal 9810173, filed July 6, 2000. Retrieved: 28 June 2011. (See U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal.) After the end of the airtanker days, many C-119s flew in Alaska for Northern Pacific Transport, Gifford Aviation, Stebbins & Ambler Air transport, and Delta Associates, being used for public service contracts, such as hauling building materials to the villages in the bush of Alaska that have no road access. Several aircraft were observed, as late as 1990, by paratroopers with the 6th Infantry Division, to be in Forest Service use as jump planes for \\"smokejumper\\" firefighters in Alaska. These aircraft were boarded and toured, by the Army paratroopers, at Ft Wainwright, Alaska.

The leaves are trifoliolate, alternate, or spiraled, and the flowers are pea-like but larger, with distinctive curved petals, and occurring in racemes. Like other legumes, Mucuna plants bear pods. They are generally bat-pollinated and produce seeds that are buoyant sea-beans. These have a characteristic three-layered appearance, appearing like the eyes of a large mammal in some species and like a hamburger in others (most notably M. sloanei) and giving rise to common names like deer-eye beans, donkey-eye beans, ox-eye beans, or hamburger seed. The name of the genus is derived from mucun√£, a Tupi‚ÄìGuarani word for these species. Ecology Some Mucuna species are used as food plants by caterpillars of Lepidoptera. These include Morpho butterflies and the two-barred flasher (Astraptes fulgerator) which is sometimes found on M. holtonii and perhaps others. The plant pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella mucunae is named for being first discovered on Mucuna. Uses Mucuna poggei pods Mucuna birdwoodiana in Hong Kong The pods of some species are covered in coarse hairs that contain the proteolytic enzyme mucunain and cause itchy blisters when they come in contact with skin; specific epithets such as pruriens (Latin: \\"itching\\") or urens (Latinized Ancient Greek: \\"stinging like a nettle\\") refer to this. Mucuna pod hairs are a common ingredient in itching powder. Other parts of the plant have medicinal properties. The plants or their extracts are sold in herbalism against a range of conditions, such as urinary tract, neurological and menstruation disorders, constipation, edema, fevers, tuberculosis, ulcers, and helminthiases like elephantiasis.Oudhia (2002) In an experiment to test if M. pruriens might have an effect on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, Katzenschlager et al. found that a seed powder had a comparable, if not more favourable, effect as commercial formulations of L-dopa, although the trial only consisted of 4 people per test group.Katzenschlager et al. (2004) M. pruriens was found to increase phosphorus availability after application of rock phosphate in one Nigerian experiment.Vanlauwe et al. (2000) M. pruriens was used in Native American milpa agriculture. Mucuna seeds contain a large number of anti- nutritional compounds. The most important is L-dopa, which the digestive system of most animals confuses with the amino acid tyrosine, causing the production of defective proteins. Other anti-nutrients are tannins, lectins, phytic acid, cyanogenic glycosides, and trypsin and amylase inhibitors, although all these can be removed by long cooking. M. pruriens may also contain chemicals such as serotonin, 5-HTP, nicotine and the hallucinogenic tryptamines 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenine and dimethyltryptamine,Erowid (2002): Mucuna pruriens. Created 2002-APR-22. Retrieved 2007-DEC-17 Mucuna is not traditionally consumed as a food crop, but some preliminary experiments have shown that if the anti-nutrients are removed or at least brought down to safe level, the beans can be fed to livestock or people. The L-dopa content is the most important and difficult toxin to get rid of. The seeds must be extensively processed before they can be safely eaten. Diallo & Berhe found the best method was to crack open the seeds and soak them in constantly running fresh water such as under an open faucet for 36 hours, or to put them in a bag and leave in a flowing river for 72 hours, before cooking them for over an hour. Over a thousand people in the Republic of Guinea were fed a meal of Mucuna (mixed with many other ingredients) with no obvious ill effects.Diallo & Berhe (2003) Species Mucuna urens parts drawing from Vervolg ob de Avbeeldingen der artseny-gewassen met derzelver Nederduitsche en Latynsche beschryvingen (Adolphus Ypey, 1813) Mucuna urens habitus Mucuna urens seed, sometimes called Hamburger bean Mucuna urens - MHNT * Mucuna adans * Mucuna acuminata * Mucuna amblyodon * Mucuna argyrophylla * Mucuna atropurpurea (Roxb.)

It was published in January 1853 by Firth, Pond, & Co. of New York. Foster was likely inspired by Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, as evidenced by the title of a sketch in Foster‚Äôs sketchbook, ‚ÄúPoor Uncle Tom, Good-Night!‚Äù Some have claimed that Foster was inspired by visits to the Bardstown, Kentucky plantation called Federal Hill in the 1850s. However, no direct or contemporary evidence of this visit has surfaced, and this claim has been contested by most prominent Foster scholars, including William Austin, Ken Emerson, and John Tasker Howard. Interpretations of the song vary widely. Most scholars of Foster agree that the song is a sentimental minstrel song, in contrast with the earlier bawdy comic minstrel songs like ‚ÄúOh Susanna‚Äù and ‚ÄúDe Camptown Races.‚Äù Frederick Douglass wrote in his 1855 autobiography My Bondage and My Freedom that the song \\"awakens sympathies for the slave, in which antislavery principles take root, grow, and flourish\\".Douglass, Frederick. My Bondage and My Freedom: Part I- Life as a Slave, Part II- Life as a Freeman, with an introduction by James M'Cune Smith. New York and Auburn: Miller, Orton & Mulligan (1855); ed. John Stauffer, Random House (2003) . However, the song‚Äôs inclusion in blackface minstrel shows, ‚ÄúTom shows‚Äù (stagings of Stowe‚Äôs novel of varying degrees of sincerity and faithfulness to the original text), and other settings have clouded its reception greatly. Creation and career impact The creation of the song \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\\" established a decisive moment within Stephen Foster's career in regard to his personal beliefs on the institution of slavery. It also is an example of the common theme of the loss of home, which is prevalent throughout Foster's work. In March 1852, Harriet Beecher Stowe's abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin appeared in bookstores in Foster's hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The novel, written about the plight of a slave in Kentucky, had a profound effect on Foster's future songwriting by altering the tone of his music to sympathize the position of the enslaved person. In his notebook, Foster penned the lyrics inspired by Stowe's novel, initially named \\"Poor Old Uncle Tom, Good-Night!\\" Foster ultimately removed references to Stowe's book, renaming the work, \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good- Night!\\" Some contend that Foster's song includes distinct Kentucky imagery from a visit to a Kentucky plantation owned by John Rowan in Bardstown, Kentucky. Foster's brother Morrison indicated in correspondence in 1898 that Foster was an \\"occasional visitor\\" to this plantation, Federal Hill. However, no contemporary evidence exists to confirm that Foster visited the plantation at or near the time of the song's composition, and the imagery in the song does not include any specific markers to Federal Hill. The Foster and Rowan family's close relationship appears to have been initiated through Stephen's sister Charlotte, who stayed with the Rowans at Federal Hill in 1828. While Charlotte lived with the Rowan family, Atkinson Hill Rowan made a proposal of marriage to her, which she ultimately declined. Charlotte died in the home of George Washing Barclay, a cousin of both families, with Atkinson Hill Rowan at her bedside. The song \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\\" is one of many examples of the loss of home in Foster's work. Biographers believe that this common theme originated from the loss of Foster's childhood home, known as the \\"White Cottage\\", an estate his mother referred to as an Eden, in reference to the Garden of Eden. The family was financially supported by the family patriarch William Foster, who owned vast holdings, which were lost through bad business dealings that left the family destitute and unable to keep possession of the White Cottage; the family was forced to leave the estate when Stephen Foster was three years old. After years of financial instability and the sharing of memories of the White Cottage with Stephen by his parents and siblings, the impact of longing for a permanent home that was no longer available to him greatly influenced his writing. Public sentiment Frederick Douglass in 1856 Upon its release in 1853 by Firth, Pond & Company, \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night\\" grew quickly in popularity, selling thousands of copies. From the beginning, the song's meaning was contested. The song's popular and nostalgic theme of the loss of home resonated with the public and received support from some within the abolitionist movement in the United States. For example, African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass promoted the song, among other similar songs of the time period, in his autobiography My Bondage and My Freedom as evoking a sentimental theme that promotes and popularizes the cause of abolishing slavery in the United States. Douglass commented, \\"They [My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!, etc.] are heart songs, and the finest feelings of human nature are expressed in them. [They] can make the heart sad as well as merry, and can call forth a tear as well as a smile. They awaken the sympathies for the slave\\", he stated, \\"in which anti- slavery principles take root and flourish\\". However, Foster also wrote and published the song as a \\"plantation melody,\\" or a sentimental minstrel song in the vein of \\"Old Folks at Home\\" or \\"Old Black Joe.\\" The song was popular on the blackface minstrel stage and in melodrama through the nineteenth century. Frequently, the song was included in \\"Tom shows,\\" stagings of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The song remained popular in amateur blackface minstrel shows through at least the first half of the twentieth century. While some of the shows (especially melodrama) in which \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" depicted slavery as wrong and the enslaved people sympathetically, many of these shows hewed to the common demeaning traditions and tropes of blackface minstrelsy. The song held popularity for over a decade and throughout the American Civil War. The song's reach throughout the United States and popularity has been attributed to soldiers of the war, who passed the tune from location to location during the war's tenure. The song remained popular through the nineteenth century. The typical reduction of the song's title from \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good- Night!\\" to \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" occurred after the turn of the century. The song's first verse and chorus are recited annually at the Kentucky Derby. Colonel Matt Winn introduced the song as a derby tradition. As early as 1930, it was played to accompany the Post Parade; the University of Louisville Marching Band has played the song for all but a few years since 1936. In 1982, Churchill Downs honored Foster by establishing the Stephen Foster Handicap. The University of Kentucky, University of Louisville, Murray State University, Eastern Kentucky University, and Western Kentucky University bands play the song at their schools' football and basketball games. Kentucky state song The song became increasingly popular as a symbol for Kentucky in the early twentieth century, a period marked by the reconciliation of sectional tensions and the consolidation of white supremacist power. This period was marked nationally by widespread racial violence and the implementation of racist Jim Crow laws. During this period. Foster's song was increasingly adopted as a symbol of a romanticized vision of the antebellum period of Kentucky, glossing over or romanticizing Kentucky's history of chattel slavery, depicted in the song. In 1928, \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" was \\"selected and adopted\\" by the Kentucky state legislature as the state's official song.When originally enacted, the provision was located at section 4618p of the Kentucky Statutes. After the re-codification of those Statutes in 1942, the provision now resides at section 2.100 of Title I, Chapter 2 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes. It has remained so, subject to one change that was made in 1986. In that year, a Japanese youth group visiting the Kentucky General Assembly sang the song to the legislators, using the original lyrics that included the word \\"darkies\\". Legislator Carl Hines was offended by this and subsequently introduced a resolution that would substitute the word \\"people\\" in place of \\"darkies\\" whenever the song was used by the House of Representatives. A similar resolution was introduced by Georgia Davis Powers in the Kentucky State Senate. The resolution was adopted by both chambers. Discussion of the episode begins approximately 82 minutes into the interview. Also see the contemporaneous reporting that appeared in the article written by Bob Johnson in the edition of March 12, 1986 of the Courier-Journal (page 18) and the Associated Press article that appeared in the edition of March 21, 1986 of the Lexington Herald-Leader (page A11). Hines' resolution was House Resolution 159 (1986); Powers' resolution was Senate Resolution 114 (1986). Modern impact Today, the song \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" remains an important composition due to its role in the evolution of American songwriting and is an influential song in American culture. According to popular-song analysts, the appeal of the theme of 'returning home' is one in which listeners of \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" are able to personally relate within their own lives. Many revisions and updates of the song have occurred throughout the past century, which have further ingrained the song in American culture. The song's origin in the blackface minstrel tradition, and its frequent continued use to depict the antebellum slave-holding south as genteel and romantic cloud its legacy. Recording history \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" was recorded many times during the early era of cylinder recordings. The Cylinder Audio Archive at the University of California (Santa Barbara) Library contains 19 commercial recordings of the song (in addition to several home recordings). In most cases, even those of the commercial recordings, the Archive is unable to determine the precise dates (or even years) of either their recording or their release, with some cylinders being dated only to a forty-year range from the 1890s to the 1920s. The earliest recording of \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" for which the Archive was able to determine a precise year of release is from 1898 and features an unidentified cornet duo.Columbia Phonograph Company 2813 (cylinder 14763 at the Cylinder Audio Archive). However, the song is known to have been recorded earlier than that (in February 1894) by the Standard Quartette, a vocal group that was appearing in a musical that featured the song (making their recording perhaps the earliest example of a cast recording). No copy of that cylinder is known to have survived. The Standard Quartette is discussed in Chapter 6 (pages 92-102). The February 1894 recordings are discussed at pages 95-97. And although cylinder recordings were more popular during the 1800s than disc records, some of the latter were being sold, mostly by Berliner Gramophone. A version sung by A.C. Weaver was recorded in September 1894 and released with catalog number 175. Note that Berliner issued \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" several times through 1899, with different singers. These re- recordings were released under the same catalog number as the original but with differently-suffixed matrix numbers. For example, the version sung by Weaver has matrix number 175-Z, whereas a later version by Irish tenor George J. Gaskin (recorded in 1897) has matrix number 175-ZZ. The popularity of \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" as recording material continued into the 20th century, despite the fact that the song was then more than fifty years old. In the first two decades of the century, newly established Victor Records released thirteen versions of the song (plus five more recordings that included it as part of a medley). During that same period, Columbia Records issued a similar number, including one by Margaret Wilson (daughter of U.S. president Woodrow Wilson).Columbia Records (\\"Symphony Series\\") A-2416 (1917) One of the major vocal groups of the day, the Peerless Quartet, recorded it twice,Indestructible Records 694 (1908) and Everlasting Records 1077 (1909) as did internationally known operatic soprano Alma Gluck.Victor Records 74386 (1914) and 74468 (1916). It was also recorded by various marching and concert bands, including three recordings by one of the most well-known, Sousa's Band,Berliner 129 (1898), Victor 3264 (1901) and Victor 2481 (1903). The two Victor recordings were labeled \\"fantasies\\". as well as three by the house concert band at Edison Records.Edison Gold Moulded 8818 (1904), Edison Amberol 87 (1909), and Edison Blue Amberol 2239 (1914), all credited to the Edison Concert Band. Although the frequency of its recording dropped off as the century progressed, \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" continued to be used as material by some of the major popular singers of the day. Versions were recorded by Kate Smith,MGM Records 30474, part of Smith's Songs of Stephen Foster album (MGM E-106) Bing Crosby,Crosby's recording appeared as the B-side on two of his singles‚Äî\\"'Til Reveille\\" (Decca Records 3886, 1941) and \\"De Camptown Races\\" (Decca Records 25129, 1947). It also appeared in his Stephen Foster album (Decca Records A-440 and A-482, both 1946). and Al Jolson.Decca Records 27365 (circa 1950) A version by operatic contralto Marian Anderson was released in JapanVictor Co. of Japan SD-4. This is the same recording that was released by Victor Records in the United States with catalog number 18314. The recording and release dates are unclear, but the physical characteristics of the label for the Japanese release (red label, circular non-scroll border, etc.), as well as the numbering of the American release, suggest that both were issued in the very early 1940s (and certainly before the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States). The recording later appeared on the 1951 LP Great Combinations (RCA Victor LM 1703). and Paul Robeson recorded his version for an English company while living in London in the late 1920s.His Master's Voice B.3653. The recording's entry at the British Library gives the recording date as October 2, 1928 (see item number BLLSA4329674 at www.explore.bl.uk). The song continued to find expression in non-traditional forms, including a New Orleans jazz version by Louis ArmstrongOn the album Satchmo Plays King Oliver (Audio Fidelity Records AFSD 5930, 1960) and a swing version by Gene Krupa.Columbia Records 35205 (1939) For a listing of some other recorded versions of the song, see External links. In 2001, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America promoted a list of the 365 \\"Songs of the Century\\" that best displayed \\"historical significance of not only the song but also of the record and artist\\". \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" appeared on that list (the only song written by Foster to do so), represented by the 1908 recording of operatic soprano Geraldine Farrar (Victor Records 88238). Adaptations By the time commercial music began to be recorded, the verse melody of \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" had become so widely known that recording artists sometimes quoted it in material that was otherwise unrelated to Foster's song. The 1918 song \\"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody\\", recorded and popularized by Al Jolson, quotes the chorus phrase \\"weep no more my lady\\", and also makes reference to two other Foster songs. Henry Burr's 1921 recording of \\"Kentucky Home\\" quotes the verse melody in an interlude midway through the record.Victor Records 18821. Written by Harold Weeks and Abe Brashen. And vaudeville singer Billy Murray's 1923 recording of \\"Happy and Go-Lucky in My Old Kentucky Home\\" adds the melody in the record's finale.Victor Records 19240. Written by Clarence Gaskill. Another version of \\"Happy and Go-Lucky ...\\" was recorded a few months later by The Happiness Boys, who extended Murray's arrangement by quoting \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" as a countermelody not just in the finale, but also in other parts of the song. That version was issued on Federal Records 5376 (the company not to be confused with the Cincinnati-based Federal Records that operated in the 1950s). It was also issued on Sears, Roebuck's Silvertone label, with catalog number 2376. An earlier recording by Murray, 1915's \\"We'll Have a Jubilee in My Old Kentucky Home\\", takes the further step of incorporating a portion of Foster's melody (but not his lyrics) into each chorus.Edison Blue Amberol Records 2748. Written by Walter Donaldson. And a few decades earlier than that, a young Charles Ives, while still a student at Yale University in the 1890s, used Foster's melody (both the verse and the chorus) as a strain in one of his marches. Ives often quoted from Foster and musicologist Clayton Henderson has detected material from \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" in eight of his works. The march is identified as Ives' third (i.e., \\"March No.3\\"). It apparently had not been recorded until 1974, when it appeared on the Yale Theater Orchestra's Old Songs Deranged (Columbia Masterworks M 32969). Because Ives added the Foster quote to a work he had already composed, there are two versions of that march‚Äîone that incorporates the melody and one that does not. The version that incorporates the melody also appears on the Detroit Chamber Winds' 1993 album Remembrance: A Charles Ives Collection (Koch International Classics 7182). In the mid-1960s, songwriter Randy Newman used the verse of \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" (with modified lyrics) as the chorus to his \\"Turpentine and Dandelion Wine\\". Newman recorded this adaptation for his 12 Songs album (1970, Reprise RS 6373) under the title \\"Old Kentucky Home\\". However, the adaptation had been recorded earlier at least twice. The first was by the Beau Brummels, who recorded it for their Triangle album (1967, Warner Brothers WS 1692). The second was by the Alan Price Set, who included it as the B-side to their \\"Love Story\\" single (1968, Decca F 12808). Since Newman's recording, the adaptation was covered several times more. The only version that charted was by Johnny Cash, who released it as a single from his John R. Cash album (1975, Columbia KC 33370). The single reached No. 42 on Billboard's country-music chart. Note that the various cover versions generally use slightly different titles, some adding \\"My\\" to Newman's title, others omitting \\"Old\\". Also, some use Newman's original title of \\"Turpentine and Dandelion Wine\\" as a subtitle. A more complete listing of these cover versions can be found in External links. Appearance in media \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" has appeared in many films, live action and animated, and in television episodes, in the 20th and 21st centuries. The original title for the first draft of Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel Gone with the Wind was \\"Tote The Weary Load\\", a lyric from \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\\" Scarlett O‚ÄôHara and Rhett Butler sing the song in Chapter 17, and the lyric \\"a few more days for to tote the weary load\\" appears in the text of the novel as Scarlett is returning to Tara.Mitchell, Margaret. Gone with the Wind. 1936. Edition: Hamilton Books, 2016. GoogleBooks pt.258. Judy Garland sang \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\\" live on December 14, 1938, on the radio show, America Calling. She later covered it again on The All Time Flop Parade with Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters. On April 29, 1953, Garland headlined a Kentucky Derby week appearance in Lexington, Kentucky, named \\"The Bluegrass Festival\\" where she sang the song \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\", accompanied by a single violin. In 1939, \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" was featured in the film version of Gone With The Wind both instrumentally and with lyrics. In the movie, Prissy, played by Butterfly McQueen, sings the line, \\"a few more days for to tote the weary load\\". In 1940, Bing Crosby sang \\"My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!\\" via radio broadcast with Leopold Stokowski conducting a symphony for the dedication of the Stephen Foster postage stamp release held in Bardstown, Kentucky, at My Old Kentucky Home. Bugs Bunny sang the opening bars to this song in the original version of the 1953 Warner Brothers cartoon Southern Fried Rabbit. In the unedited version, Bugs is playing the banjo disguised in blackface to fool Yosemite Sam. Later releases omit this part due to negative racial stereotypes. Kate Smith performed the song on March 20, 1969, on The Dean Martin Show with Mickey Rooney and Barbara Eden. The song was covered in The Simpsons, Season 21, Episode 13, \\"The Color Yellow\\". Marge and Lisa read from the footnotes of a cookbook written by Mabel Simpson in which she describes the escape of a slave, Virgil, who is assisted by Eliza Simpson. Virgil and Eliza find safe harbor in a circus operated by Krusty the Clown, who hides them from slave patrollers by disguising them as circus acts. Krusty asks what talents Virgil possesses, to which he replies that he has music talent and then performs the song, \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" while playing violin. The song also appears in the episode \\"Rosebud\\", where a young George Burns sings the song's first line. The song was covered in Mad Men, Season 3, Episode 3, \\"My Old Kentucky Home.\\" Roger Sterling (played by John Slattery) performs the song in blackface for a company Kentucky Derby party. Johnny Depp, Lyle Lovett, David Amram and Warren Zevon covered the song \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" at the tribute memorial of journalist Hunter Thompson in December 1996. One of Thompson's most notable pieces, \\"The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved\\", in addition to Thompson being a native of Louisville, Kentucky, inspired the performers to cover the song for his tribute. The performance was recreated 9 years later in 2005 at midnight after Thompson's ashes were blasted from a cannon. Lyrics by Stephen Foster The original Stephen Foster lyrics of the song, were: The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home. 'Tis summer, the darkies are gay, The corn top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom While the birds make music all the day. The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, All merry, all happy, and bright. By 'n by hard times comes a-knocking at the door, Then my old Kentucky home, good night. Weep no more my lady, oh! weep no more today! We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home, For the old Kentucky home far away. They hunt no more for the 'possum and the coon, On the meadow, the hill and the shore, They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon, On the bench by the old cabin door. The day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart, With sorrow where all was delight. The time has come when the darkies have to part, Then my old Kentucky home, good night! Weep no more my lady, oh! weep no more today! We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home, For the old Kentucky home far away. The head must bow and the back will have to bend, Wherever the darkies may go. A few more days and the trouble all will end, In the field where the sugar-canes grow. A few more days for to tote the weary load, No matter 'twill never be light. A few more days till we totter on the road, Then my old Kentucky home, good-night! Weep no more my lady, oh! weep no more today! We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home, For the old Kentucky home far away.Aldrich, Mark. A Catalog of Folk Song Settings for Wind Band, p. 74 (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2004).Foster, Stephen. Stephen Foster Song Book: Original Sheet Music of 40 Songs, p. 67 (Courier Corporation, 1974). Adaptations Most modern renditions of the song change the word darkies to people (with the Commonwealth of Kentucky officially adopting this change in 1986). Many other adaptations of the song have been sung over the years. The following example changes the lyrics from third- to first-person, begins in past tense then changes to present tense, and adds more direct reference to slavery in an effort to represent Foster's original intent for the song to honor the story told in Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. The sun shone bright on the old Kentucky home. 'Twas summer, and we were all gay. The corn was ripe and the meadow was in bloom, While the songbirds made their music all the day. The children rolled ‚Äòround my little cabin floor, All merry, all happy, all bright. But by 'n by hard times came a-knocking at my door, Then my old Kentucky home, good night. Weep no more my lady, oh! weep no more today! Oh, we'll sing one song for the old Kentucky home, For my old Kentucky home far away. We‚Äôll hunt no more for the 'possum or the coon, In the meadow, on the hill, or the shore, We‚Äôll sing no more by the glimmer of the moon, On the bench by my old cabin door. The days go by like a shadow o'er my heart, Now there‚Äôs sorrow where all was delight. The time has come, when I am sold apart, Then my old Kentucky home, good night! Weep no more my lady, oh! weep no more today! Oh, we'll sing one song for the old Kentucky home, For my old Kentucky home far away. Now my head must bow and my back will have to bend, Down the river, where I am to go. A few more days and my trouble all will end, In the fields where the sugar-canes grow. A few more days for to tote my weary load, ‚ÄòTis no matter, it will never be light. A few more days, now my seeds are all sowed, Then my old Kentucky home, good-night! Weep no more my lady, oh! weep no more today! Oh, we'll one song for the old Kentucky home, For my old Kentucky home far away.

Krier combines an international architecture & planning practice with writing and teaching. He is well-known for his master plan for Poundbury, in Dorset, England. He is the younger brother of architect Rob Krier.  Biography  On 27 October 2017, in the Main Square of Poundbury, Prince Charles unveiled a statue in tribute to the late Queen Mother, the pedestal of which was designed by L√©on Krier. The Krier House, Seaside, Florida, designed late 1980s Alessandria, Italy Krier abandoned his architectural studies at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in 1968, after only one year, to work in the office of architect James Stirling in London, UK. After four years working for Stirling, interrupted by a two years association with Josef Paul Kleihues in Berlin, Krier spent 20 years in England practicing and teaching at the Architectural Association and Royal College of Art. In this period, Krier's statement: ‚ÄúI am an architect, because I don‚Äôt build‚Äù,Ian Latham, \\"L√©on Krier. A Profile....\\", Architectural Design, vol. 57, no 1/2, 1987, p.37 became a famous expression of his uncompromising anti-modernist attitude. From the late 1970s onwards he has been one of the most influential modern traditional architects and planners. He is one of the first and most prominent critics of architectural modernism, mainly of its functional zoning and the ensuing suburbanism, campaigning for the reconstruction of the traditional European city model and its growth based on the polycentric city model. His ideas had a great influence on the New Urbanism movement, both in the USA and Europe. The most complete compilation of them is published in his book The Architecture of Community. He is best known for his masterplan for, and ongoing oversight of, the development of Poundbury, an urban extension to Dorchester, UK for the Duchy of Cornwall and the Prince of Wales; and for his masterplan for Paseo Cayal√°, an extension of four new urban quarters for Guatemala City. From 1976‚Äì2016 Krier was a visiting professor at the Universities of Princeton, Yale, Virginia, Cornell and Notre Dame. From 1987‚Äì90 Krier was the first director of the SOMAI, the Skidmore, Owings & Merrill Architectural Institute, in Chicago. Since 1990, Krier has been industrial designer for Valli e Valli - Assa Abloy and Giorgetti, an Italian furniture company. In 2003 Krier became the inaugural Driehaus Architecture Prize laureate. Krier acts as architectural consultant on his urban planning projects but only designs buildings of his personal choice. Amongst his best known realizations are the temporary fa√ßade at the 1980 Venice Biennale; the Krier house in the resort village of Seaside, Florida, USA (where he also advised on the masterplan); the S√£o Miguel Odrinhas Archaeological Museum of Sintra, Portugal; the Windsor Village Hall in Florida; the Jorge M. Perez Architecture Center, the University of Miami School of Architecture in Miami, Florida; and the new Neighbourhood Center Citt√† Nuova in Alessandria, Italy. Though Krier is well known for his defense of classical architecture and the reconstruction of traditional ‚ÄúEuropean city‚Äù models, close scrutiny of his work in fact shows a shift from an early Modernist rationalist approach (project for University of Bielefeld, 1968) towards a vernacular and classical approach both formally and technologically. The project that marked a major turning point in his campaigning attitude towards the reconstruction of the traditional European city was his scheme (unrealized) for the 'reconstruction' of his home city of Luxembourg (1978), in response to the modernist redevelopment of the city. He later master planned Luxembourg's new Cit√© Judiciaire that was to be architecturally designed by his brother (1990‚Äì2008). In 1990, of the nine experts invited he was the only one to support the Dresden citizens initiative to reconstruct the historic Dresden Frauenkirche and the Historische Neumarkt area and, in 2007, the Frankfurt Altstadt Forum, citizen initiative which succeeded in reconstructing the historic \\"H√ºhnermarkt\\" area against strong professional and political opposition. Krier has applied his theories in large-scale, detailed plans for numerous cities in the Western world like the unrealized schemes Kingston upon Hull (1977), Rome (1977), Luxembourg (1978) most comprehensive masterplan focusing on sprawl repair and town center repair, West Berlin (1977‚Äì83), Bremen (1978‚Äì1980), Stockholm (1981), Poing Nord, Munich (1983), a masterplan for the completion till the year 2000 of Washington D.C. (1984) commissioned by the M.O.M.A of New York; Atlantis, an ideal classical town for intellectuals and artists, Tenerife (1987); also in projects for new towns commissioned by developers, like Area Fiat, Novoli, Italy, (1993) and Corbeanca Romania (2007), and by public administrations like the redevelopment of Tor Bella Monaca, a degraded suburb of Rome, (2010) and a long term redevelopment policy plan of the municipal area of Cattolica, Rimini, Italy (2017) and those of High Malton Masterplan for the Fitzwilliam Estate, Yorkshire, U.K. (2014) and the redevelopment of the demised Fawley Waterside Power Station, Southampton, U.K. (2017) in the permitting stage; then in built developments like Knokke, Heulebrug Belgium (1998) near completion after Krier‚Äôs plan but without his direction; and in his masterplan for Newquay growth area (2002-2006), Cornwall, UK, after his resignation continued by Adam Associates. And the ones he is currently implementing for Poundbury Dorset, U.K. (1988 onwards); Paseo Cayal√°, Guatemala City (2003 onwards); and El Socorro, two new urban quarters for Guatemala City (2018 onwards) and a new town, Herencia de Allende, near San Miguel de Allende, M√©xico (2018 onwards). The size of the city Guatemala City, Guatemala, by L√©on Krier Krier agreed with the viewpoint of the late Heinrich Tessenow that there is a strict relationship between the economic and cultural wealth of a city, on the one hand, and the limitation of its population on the other. But this is not a matter of mere hypothesis, he argues, but historical fact. The measurements and geometric organization of a city and of its quarters are not the result of mere chance or accident or simply of economic necessity, but rather represents a civilizing order which is not only aesthetic and technical but also legislative and ethical. Krier claims, that ‚Äúthe whole of Paris is a pre- industrial city which still works, because it is so adaptable, something the creations of the 20th century will never be. A city like Milton Keynes cannot survive an economic crisis, or any other kind of crisis, because it is planned as a mathematically determined social and economic project. If that model collapses, the city will collapse with it.‚Äù Thus Krier argues not merely against the contemporary modernist city (he in fact argues that places like Los Angeles, U.S., are not cities), but against a gigantism tendency in urban growth, evident in the exploding scale of urban networks and buildings in European cities throughout the 19th century which was a result of the concentration of economic, political and cultural power.Leon Krier, ‚ÄúUrban Components‚Äù, Architectural Design, vol. 54, no 7/8, 1984, p.43 In response to this, Krier proposed the reconstruction of the European city, based on polycentric settlement models which are dictated not by machine scale but by human scale both horizontally and vertically, of self-sufficient mixed use quarters not exceeding (able to be crossed in 10 minutes walk) of building heights of 3 to 5 floors or 100 steps (able to be walked up comfortably) and which are limited not by mere administrative borders but by walkable, ridable, drivable boulevards, tracks, park ways. Cities then grow by the multiplication of independent urban quarters, not by horizontal or vertical over-extensions of established urban cores.  On the development of the city  Krier has written a number of essays ‚àí many first published in the journal Architectural Design, against modernist town planning and its principle of dividing up the city into a system of single use zones (housing, shopping, industry, leisure, etc.), as well as the resultant suburbia, commuting, etc. Indeed, Krier sees the modernist planner as a tyrannical figure that imposes detrimental megastructural scale more dictated by ideology than necessity.Leon Krier; 'Houses, Palaces, Cities', Architectural Design, London, 54, 7/8, 1984. Krier summons up his criticisms and pinpoints concepts in the form of series of drawings and didactic annotated diagrams, often in his own handwriting, eventually collected in his book Drawings for Architecture, like the concept of Urban in his 1983 diagram of a truly urban town= RES PUBLICA+RES PRIVATE. There he conceives the basic urban fabric, made of private buildings and uses, as an object of vernacular local design and the exceptional public and institutional buildings as objects of classical architecture and located in privileged sites, on squares and in the focus of major vistas.  On architecture and the city  Windsor, Florida, 1997, by L√©on Krier The principle behind Krier‚Äôs writings has been to explain the rational foundations of architecture and the city, stating that ‚ÄúIn the language of symbols, there can exist no misunderstanding‚Äù. That is to say, for Krier, buildings have a rational order and type: a house, a palace, a temple, a campanile, a church; but also a roof, a column, a window, etc., what he terms ‚Äúnameable objects‚Äù. As projects get bigger, he goes on to argue, the buildings should not get bigger, but divide up; thus, for instance, in his unrealized scheme for a school in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (1978), France, the school became a ‚Äúcity in miniature‚Äù. Krier proposes functional programs greatly varied within each block and plot. For him the building‚Äôs design should always be typologically or tectonically justified and the variety of building types and volumes should reflect this functional variety in an evident and natural way; in short all gratuitous uniformity or gratuitous variety should be avoided designing neighboring building lots of dimensional, functional and thus formal variety and in such a way as to generate networks of public spaces consisting of public streets, squares, avenues, boulevards, parks. For Krier it is essential to compose at once the harmony of the urban blocks and of the inseparable public spaces generated between them. In searching for such a typological architecture, Krier‚Äôs work has been termed ‚Äúan architecture without a style‚Äù. However, it has also been pointed out that the appearance of his architecture is very much like Roman architecture, which he then places in all his projects, be it central London, Stockholm, Tenerife or Florida.‚ÄùCharles Jencks, ‚ÄúPost-Modernism and Eclectic Continuity‚Äù, Architectural Design, vol. 57, no 1/2, 1987, 25 =A selection of manifesto texts by Krier= Many of these are available online *The idea of reconstruction *Critique of zoning *Town and country *Critique of the megastructural city *Critique of industrialization *Urban components *The city within the city ‚Äì Les Quartiers *The size of a city *Critique of Modernisms *Organic versus mechanical composition *Names and nicknames *Building and architecture *The reconstruction of the European city *What is an urban quartier?

Proclaimed the \\"longest shortest river in the world\\" by locals, it runs entirely within the city limits of New Braunfels in southeast Comal County. It is a tributary of the Guadalupe River. The Comal begins at Comal Springs in Landa Park and flows until its junction with the Guadalupe. The Comal was originally called the Little Guadalupe in early Spanish accounts. After Spaniard Pedro de Rivera y Villal√≥n identified the longer river as the Guadalupe in 1727, the Comal was given its current name. The name means basin or flat dish in Spanish. Historically, the Comal was used to power watermills and cotton gins by early German settlers, and later to provide hydroelectric power. The river is primarily used for water recreation today, being the location of the original Schlitterbahn water amusement park. The water is administered by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. The river is also one of only two rivers to host the fountain darter, a fish now in danger of extinction. The only other river inhabited by the darter is the nearby San Marcos River. Recreation Mild currents, clear water, and a host of lost items left behind by tubers make the river a common locale for scuba diving. Because the Comal maintains a temperature of approximately year round, divers are present in both the summer and the winter. Thousands of people tube down the Comal River in the spring and summer. Tubing on the Comal provides a less intense alternative to tubing on the nearby Guadalupe river, where one may encounter frequent rapids and boulders to paddle around. The Schlitterbahn Water Park is built along a stretch of the river.

It was discovered on 21 March 1993, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at the Palomar Observatory in California. The likely S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 8.0 hours. It was named after children's television host Fred Rogers.  Orbit and classification  Misterrogers is a member of the Mars-crossing asteroids, a dynamically unstable group between the main belt and the near-Earth populations, crossing the orbit of Mars at 1.66 AU. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.5‚Äì3.1 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,311 days; semi-major axis of 2.34 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.34 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as ' at the Goethe Link Observatory in September 1952. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery published by the Digitized Sky Survey, taken at Palomar in May 1990, almost 3 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Fred McFeely Rogers (1928‚Äì2003), who was the host of the children's television program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood for more than 30 years. The naming was proposed, and citation prepared, by John G. Radzilowicz, Director of the Henry Buhl, Jr. Planetarium & Observatory at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 May 2003 (). Rogers had a lifelong fascination with the sky and astronomy, obtained a pilot's license while still in high school‚Äîalso produced with the Carnegie Science Center a planetarium show called The Sky above Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which is still shown at many planetariums across the United States.  Physical characteristics  Misterrogers is an assumed, stony S-type asteroid. In line with the body's determined albedo (see below). = Rotation period = In April 2011, a rotational lightcurve of Misterrogers was obtained from photometric observations by Brian A. Skiff at Anderson Mesa Station. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.13 magnitude (). A low brightness amplitude is indicative for a spherical rather than elongated shape. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Misterrogers measures 6.33 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28. However, a WISE-study dedicated to Mars- crossing asteroids in 2017 determined a larger diameter of 8.19 kilometers with an albedo of 0.20.

The London Necropolis Railway was opened in 1854 as a reaction to severe overcrowding in London's existing graveyards and cemeteries. It aimed to use the recently developed technology of the railway to move as many burials as possible to the newly built Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey. This location was within easy travelling distance of London, but distant enough for the dead not to pose any risk to public hygiene. There were two locations for the station; the first was in operation from 1854 to 1902, the second from 1902 to 1941. Although it had its own branch line into Brookwood Cemetery, most of the route of the London Necropolis Railway ran on the existing London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which could also be used to hold funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies. In 1899 the location of the terminus was blocking the expansion of Waterloo station. After much negotiation, the LSWR reached agreement with the London Necropolis Company, the owners of the cemetery and the railway: in return for the existing site, the LSWR re-equipped the London Necropolis Railway and supplied it with a new station on Westminster Bridge Road. This new building was designed to contrast with other funeral directors' premises by being as attractive as possible. In 1902 the railway moved into the new building, and the earlier station was demolished. On 16 April 1941, during World War II the station was heavily damaged in an air raid. Much of the building was destroyed and the tracks to the station were rendered unusable. Although some funeral trains continued to run from nearby Waterloo station, the London terminus was never used again. Following the end of the war the London Necropolis Company decided that reopening the London Necropolis Railway was not financially worthwhile, and the surviving part of the station building was sold as office space. This remnant remains intact, and relatively unaltered since its opening.  Background  In the first half of the 19th century the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. The city's dead had been buried in and around the local churches. With a limited amount of space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. Despite the rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300 acres (0.5 sq mi; 1.2 km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply, and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. In 1848‚Äì49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. In the wake of public concerns following the cholera epidemics and the findings of a Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851. Under the Burials Act, new burials were prohibited in what were then the built-up areas of London. = London Necropolis Company = alt=Map of a city surrounded by small cemeteries, and two larger proposed cemeteries slightly further out. A railway line runs from the city to a single large cemetery to the southwest, a long way further out. Sir Richard Broun and Richard Sprye proposed to use the emerging technology of mechanised land transport to solve the problem of London's dead. Broun and Sprye envisaged buying a single very large tract of land around from London in Brookwood near Woking, Surrey, to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis. At this distance, the land would be far beyond the maximum anticipated size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) ‚Äì which had connected London to Woking in 1838 ‚Äì would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that the speed of the railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site. On 30 June 1852 the promoters of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed, and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company (LNC) was formed. The former Woking Common, owned by the Earl of Onslow at Brookwood was chosen as the site for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did not specify detail of how the funeral trains were to operate. On 7 November 1854 the new cemetery opened and the southern Anglican section was consecrated by Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester. On 13 November the first scheduled London Necropolis Railway train left the new London Necropolis railway station for the cemetery, and the first burial (that of the stillborn twins of a Mr and Mrs Hore of Ewer Street, Southwark Borough) took place.  First station (1854‚Äì1902)  A site for the London terminus near Waterloo had been suggested by Sir Richard Broun. Its proximity to the River Thames meant that bodies could be cheaply transported to the terminus by water from much of London, while being situated near three major Thames bridges meant that the area was easily accessed from both north and south of the river by road. The arches of the huge brick viaduct carrying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo station) were easily converted into mortuaries. Broun also felt that the journey out of London from Waterloo Bridge would be less distressing for mourners: while most of the rail routes out of London ran through tunnels and deep cuttings, or through densely populated areas, at this time the urban development of what is now south London had not taken place and the LSWR route ran almost entirely through parkland and countryside. The LNC also contemplated taking over the LSWR's former terminus at Nine Elms railway station (which following the 1848 opening of the much more convenient Waterloo Bridge station was used only for goods traffic, chartered trains taking migrants to North America, and the private trains of the royal family) as either the main or a secondary terminus. Despite objections from local residents concerned about the effects of potentially large numbers of dead bodies being stored in a largely residential area, in March 1854 the LNC settled on a single terminus in Waterloo and purchased a plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street (now Leake Street) for the site. Architect William Tite and engineer William Cubitt drew up a design for a station, which was approved in June 1854. The station was completed in October 1854, at a total construction cost of ¬£23,231 14s 4d (about ¬£ in terms of spending power). On 13 November 1854 the first train left London for the new London Necropolis. Tite and Cubitt's design was based around a three-storey main building, separated from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines. The private access road was intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and to avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The ground floor contained a grand entrance hall and staircase for mourners attending first and second class funerals, a smaller entrance hall and staircase for those attending lower classes of funeral, and two mortuaries which occupied the majority of the floor. A large room adjacent to the mortuary held a reserve stock of around 300 coffins. Most mourners would have commissioned their own coffins, or used coffins bought by the deceased during their lifetime but, explained an official of the LNC (in 1898) the reserve of coffins was kept so that \\"should a guest die in a hotel, and the landlord wished to keep it quiet, we are notified, and in the middle of the night we come for the corpse, and take it away in one of our ready-made wooden overcoats\\". The first floor held the LNC's boardroom, the LNC's funerary workshops, a series of separate waiting rooms for those attending second and third class funerals, and the building's main toilets. The second floor, level with the LSWR railway line, held the train shed covering the two private rail lines and the single platform at which the trains stopped, eight or nine waiting rooms for first class mourners, and further toilets for their use. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level. A glass roof was positioned in order that no shadow be cast on the hearse carriage waiting at the platform at the time the trains were scheduled to depart, and the western wall was windowless to avoid passengers using the LSWR station being able to see into the Necropolis station. Glass panels inset between the two rail lines allowed sunlight through to the private access road below. Unlike most railway stations of the period, the designs of the first, second and third class waiting rooms were largely identical with only superficial differences. Although the original terminus did not have its own chapel, on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church. On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel. One of the more notable funerals to be held at the terminus was that of Friedrich Engels, co-creator (with Karl Marx) of modern communism, who died in London on 5 August 1895. Engels had expressed a wish to be cremated and his ashes scattered at sea, but there was no crematorium near London. The LNC had an arrangement with Woking Crematorium, by which Necropolis Railway stations and trains could be used by mourners attending cremations at Woking. For Engels's funeral on 10 August 1895 around 150 people attended a morning service in a waiting room at the LNC terminus. Although the cremation was scheduled for 1:15 pm formalities with the death certificate delayed the departure, and the special train did not arrive at the cemetery's North station (the station serving the part of the cemetery reserved for non-Anglicans) until after 4:00 pm. The majority of the mourners remained at North station in the cemetery, and only 12 mourners accompanied the coffin to Woking; as the service had already been held in London, on arrival at Woking, Engels's body was transferred straight from the hearse to the furnace. Engels's ashes (cremated remains) were recovered from the furnace and transferred to an unrecorded location in Brookwood Cemetery, and 17 days later removed from the cemetery and scattered from Beachy Head (in East Sussex). Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor Marx died in 1898 and was also cremated at Woking following a service at the LNC's London terminus (probably in the same room in which Engels's service had been held three years previously) and carriage to North station by the Necropolis Railway. Woking Crematorium, first used for human cremation in 1885, cooperated closely with the LNC, as they hoped to prevent the LNC building their own crematorium at Brookwood. The LNC never built their own crematorium, although a columbarium (building for the storage of cremation ashes) was added to Brookwood Cemetery in 1910. For extremely large funerals such as those of major public figures, the LSWR would provide additional trains from Waterloo to Brookwood station on the main line to meet the demand. Charles Bradlaugh, Member of Parliament for Northampton, was a vocal advocate of Indian self-government and a popular figure among the Indian community in London, many of whom attended his funeral on 3 February 1891. Over 5,000 mourners, including 21-year-old Mohandas Gandhi, were carried on three long special LSWR trains, one of which was 17 carriages long. In 1874, with Waterloo Bridge station becoming extremely busy, the LSWR attempted to take over one of the LNC's two rail lines. An 1875 agreement between the LSWR and LNC permitted the LSWR to take over the westernmost track (that not served by the platform), in return for improved terms on the lease of the land currently leased by the LNC from the LSWR, and the LSWR taking over the maintenance of the structure supporting the LNC lines. In 1876 and 1877 the roof and western wall of the LNC train shed were demolished and replaced with a cantilevered awning over the single platform; the platform was extended to compensate for the loss of the second line. = Waterloo expansion proposal = In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge station in 1886) was equipped with new signals, which required a gantry spanning all the lines into the station. In return for the LSWR cladding the LNC's entrance on Westminster Bridge Road with white glazed brick, the LNC gave consent for the stanchion supporting the gantry to rest on the LNC's platform, while reserving the right to demand the gantry be removed. At this time the LSWR also leased a small plot of land west of the Westminster Bridge Road entrance to serve as the site of new offices for the LNC, designed by Cyril Bazett Tubbs. As the site of the Necropolis station had been intentionally chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as an obstacle to any increase in the number of lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus. In 1896 the LSWR formally presented the LNC with a proposal to provide the LNC with a new station in return for the existing station. The LNC agreed to the proposals, but with a number of conditions attached. The LSWR was to allow the LNC control of the design of the new station, lease the new station to the LNC for a token rent in perpetuity, provide new rolling stock, remove any limit on the number of passengers using the Necropolis service, and provide the free carriage of machinery and equipment to be used in the cemetery. The LNC had an extremely strong negotiating position as their existing site was crucial to any expansion of Waterloo station, and in addition they had the legal right to demand the removal of the stanchion supporting Waterloo's signal gantry. Although the LSWR was extremely unhappy at what they considered excessive demands, they had no choice but to comply. In May 1899 the companies signed an agreement, in which the LSWR gave in to every LNC demand. In addition the LSWR paid ¬£12,000 compensation (about ¬£ in terms of consumer spending power) for the inconvenience of relocating the LNC station and offices, and agreed that mourners returning from the cemetery could travel on any LSWR train to Waterloo, Vauxhall or Clapham Junction.  Second station (1902‚Äì1941)  alt=Narrow four storey red building above a wide archway The site for the replacement terminus was identified in 1896, and bought by the LSWR in 1899 for ¬£5,500 (about ¬£ in terms of consumer spending power). South of the existing station and on the opposite side of Westminster Bridge Road, its main entrance was at 121 Westminster Bridge Road. The site was roughly S-shaped: the entrance from Westminster Bridge Road led to a strip of land at a right angle to the entrance and running behind existing buildings on Westminster Bridge Road. This in turn led to the location identified for the two new rail lines, at a right angle to the central strip (i.e. parallel to the entrance). Work on the new station began in the summer of 1900, and was completed on 8 February 1902 at a total construction cost to the LSWR of ¬£43,494 (about ¬£ in terms of consumer spending power) excluding the cost of the land. While construction was underway the original terminus remained in use, although the LSWR was granted running rights through the station. On 23 February Major J. W. Pringle of the Board of Trade inspected the new building and expressed concerns over the safety of the arrangements for trains entering the station from the main line, which entailed crossing the LSWR's multiple tracks. He was also unhappy about the newly installed passenger lifts and the unfinished nature of the passenger terminus, but nonetheless approved the limited use of the new station for funeral trains. Soon after the transfer of LNC services to the new building the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station, destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus. The new building, also designed by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, was designed for attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey office building stood at 188 Westminster Bridge Road. The ground floor was taken up by a large arch leading to a waiting room, an office for general enquiries, and the long driveway leading to the station itself; above this were the LNC's offices and boardrooms. First class mourners entered through the driveway under the office building which turned sharply left to run beneath a glass canopy parallel to Westminster Bridge Road; this stretch was faced with glazed white brick and lined with palm and bay trees. The driveway ran past mortuaries and storerooms to the lifts and stairs to the platforms, and also to a secondary entrance on Newnham Terrace (off Hercules Road). Above the mortuaries and storerooms were the LNC's workshops. Lifts and an elaborate wrought-iron staircase led from the lower two floors to platform level on the second floor. This upper level housed a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood to pay their respects to the deceased. A short and wide pathway led to the first class platform, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office; the first class platform was equipped with five separate waiting rooms to keep mourners from different funeral parties separate. A glass screen separated the first class platform and circulating area from the platform and circulating area for third class passengers. The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and not equipped with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase led to a single communal waiting room on the first floor, and to the third class platform on the second floor, much shorter than the first class platform. There was still an ability to transport large parties on occasions. The funeral of Indian businessman Sir Nowroji Saklatwala on 25 July 1938 saw 155 mourners travelling first class on a dedicated LNC train.  Operations  alt=Railway ticket labelled \\"Southern Railways London Necropolis Coffin Ticket, Waterloo to Brookwood, Third Class The London Necropolis Company offered three classes of funerals. A first class funeral allowed the person buying the funeral to select the grave site of their choice anywhere in the cemetery; at the time of opening, first class prices began at ¬£2 10s (about ¬£ in terms) for a basic plot with no special coffin specifications. It was expected by the LNC that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following the funeral. Second class funerals cost ¬£1 (about ¬£ in terms) and allowed some control over the burial location. The right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings (about ¬£ in terms); if a permanent memorial was not erected the LNC reserved the right to re-use the grave in future. Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense in the section of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor. Brookwood was one of the few cemeteries to permit burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend funerals without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance. For those third class funerals paid for by the parish, two third class tickets would be provided at the parish's expense (one ticket in the case of a child's death). Further mourners for third class funerals were obliged to pay for their own tickets to the Necropolis. On arrival at the terminus the mourners would be led either to one of the dedicated first class waiting rooms (for first and second class funerals) or to the communal third class waiting room. The coffin would be discreetly unloaded from the hearse and sent to the platform level by lift. Those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch the coffins being loaded onto the train if they so wished. (After the relocation to the new London terminus in 1902, some funeral services would be held in the Chapelle Ardente at platform level, for those cases where mourners were unable to make the journey to Brookwood.) Each door of the waiting train would be labelled with the name of the deceased, to ensure all passengers travelled with the correct funeral party; the names of the deceased being carried on the train would be called in turn, and that person's mourners would board the train. At the time the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with separate Anglican and Nonconformist sections of the train. This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers. Intended to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35 am (11.20 am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction (where the branch line into the cemetery left the main LSWR line) at 12.25 pm (12.20 pm on Sundays). The train only ran if there was a coffin or passengers at the London terminus waiting to use it, and both the journey from London to Brookwood and the later return would be cancelled if nobody was due to leave London that morning. It would not run if there was only a single third or second class coffin to be carried, and in these cases the coffin and funeral party would be held until the next service. Generally the trains ran direct from London to the cemetery, other than occasional stops to take on water. Between 1890 and 1910 the trains also sometimes stopped at Vauxhall and Clapham Junction for the benefit of mourners from south west London who did not want to travel via the Waterloo terminus, but these intermediate stops were discontinued and never reinstated. After 1 October 1900 the Sunday trains were discontinued, and from 1902 the daily train service was ended and trains ran only as required.  Destruction  During the Second World War Waterloo station and the nearby Thames bridges were a significant target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the Necropolis station during the London Blitz of 1940‚Äì41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged during the early stages of the bombing campaign, and services generally continued as normal. alt=A railway platform strewn with rubble. Broken girders jut out above the platform, while alongside the platform a set of railway lines stop abruptly at a large crater. Next to the railway line is a burned-out railway carriage tilted at an acute angle. During the night of 16‚Äì17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area, and the LNC's good fortune in avoiding damage to their facilities finally ran out. In the early stages of the air raid the rolling stock stored in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, although the terminal building itself remained unscathed. At 10.30 pm multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building. While the office building and platforms survived, the workshops, driveway and Chapelle Ardente were destroyed, along with the third class waiting room. The Divisional Engineer of the Southern Railway (SR, which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways) inspected the damage at 2.00 pm on 17 April, and his report read simply \\"Necropolis and buildings demolished\\". On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed. The last recorded funeral carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish (1868‚Äì1941), buried on 11 April 1941. The SR offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling to and from the cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR's fast and frequent services to their own Brookwood railway station. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which bona fide mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11.57 am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional departure time), but the SR management (themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage) refused to entertain any compromise.  Closure  In September 1945, following the end of hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained, the branch line was in extremely poor condition. Although the original promoters of the scheme had envisaged Brookwood Cemetery becoming London's main or only cemetery, the scheme had never been as popular as they had hoped. In the original proposal, Sir Richard Broun had calculated that over its first century of operations the cemetery would have seen around five million burials at a rate of 50,000 per year, the great majority of which would have utilised the railway. In reality at the time the last train ran on 11 April 1941, almost 87 years after opening, only 203,041 people had been buried in the cemetery. Before the outbreak of hostilities increased use of motorised road transport had damaged the profitability of the railway for both the LNC and the SR. Faced with the costs of rebuilding the cemetery branch line, building a new London terminus and replacing the rolling stock damaged or destroyed in the air raid, the directors concluded that \\"past experience and present changed conditions made the running of the Necropolis private train obsolete\\". In mid-1946 the LNC formally informed the SR that the Westminster Bridge Road terminus would not be reopened. The decision prompted complicated negotiations with the SR over the future of the LNC facilities in London. In December 1946 the directors of the two companies finally reached agreement. The railway-related portions of the LNC site (the waiting rooms, the caretaker's flat and the platforms themselves) would pass into the direct ownership of the SR, while the remaining surviving portions of the site (the office block on Westminster Bridge Road, the driveway and the ruined central portion of the site) would pass to the LNC to use or dispose of as they saw fit. The LNC sold the site to the British Humane Association in May 1947 for ¬£21,000 (about ¬£ in terms of consumer spending power), and the offices of the LNC were transferred to the Superintendent's Office at Brookwood. The SR continued to use the surviving sections of the track as occasional sidings into the 1950s, before clearing what remained of their section of the site. With most of the LNC's business being operated by road, an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC to make use of SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals, subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR (British Railways after 1948) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train. Although one of the LNC's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used, and coffins were carried in the luggage space of the SR's coaches. Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the funeral party and transported by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations, or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road. = The site today = The site of the first terminus was cleared during the expansion of the viaduct into Waterloo in the early 20th century, and no trace of it remains. Most of the site of the second station was sold by the LNC and built over with new office developments in the years following the end of the Second World War, but the office building on Westminster Bridge Road, over the former entrance to the station driveway, remains relatively unaltered externally although the words \\"London Necropolis\\" carved into the stone above the driveway have been covered. Refurbishments and cleaning in the 1980s restored the fa√ßade of the building to an appearance similar to that of the time of its building. Other than iron columns in Newnham Terrace which once supported the Necropolis Railway tracks, and a surviving section of the internal driveway used as a car park, the Westminster Bridge Road building is the only surviving part of the London Necropolis Railway in London.

The operation was performed successfully on September 7, 2001 by Professor Jacques Marescaux and his team from the IRCAD (Institute for Research into Cancer of the Digestive System). This was the first time in medical history that a technical solution proved capable of reducing the time delay inherent to long distance transmissions sufficiently to make this type of procedure possible. The name was derived from the American aviator Charles Lindbergh, because he was the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Details of the procedure The operation involved minimally invasive surgery: The 45-minute procedure consisted of a cholecystectomy on a 68-year- old female patient in surgical ward A in Strasbourg Civil Hospital, in Eastern France. From New York, the surgeon controlled the arms of the ZEUS Robotic Surgical System, designed by Computer Motion, to operate on the patient. The link between the robotic system and the surgeon was provided by a high-speed fiberoptic service deployed thanks to the combined efforts of several France Telecom group entities. Commenting on the operation, Professor Marescaux said: Project partners The surgery was the result of a closely coordinated partnership between IRCAD, the France T√©l√©com group and Computer Motion, the developer of Zeus surgical robotic systems. The EITS (European Institute of Telesurgery) was also involved.

The present incarnation replaced the Victoria Tower after the latter burned down in 1916, along with most of the Centre Block; only the Library of Parliament survived. It serves as a Canadian icon and had been featured prominently on the Canadian twenty- dollar bill directly adjacent the queen's visage, until the change to polymer. Characteristics Designed by Jean Omer Marchand and John A. Pearson, the tower is a campanile whose height reaches 92.2 m (302 ft 6 in), over which are arranged a multitude of stone carvings, including approximately 370 gargoyles, grotesques, and friezes, keeping with the Victorian High Gothic style of the rest of the parliamentary complex. The walls are of Nepean sandstone and the roof is of reinforced concrete covered with copper. One of four grotesques at the corners of the Peace Tower At its base is a porte-coch√®re within four equilateral pointed arches, the north of which frames the main entrance of the Centre Block, and the jambs of the south adorned by the supporters of the Royal Arms of Canada. Near the apex, just below the steeply pitched roof, are the tower's 4.8 m (16 ft) diameter clock faces, one on each of the four facades. The mechanical workings of the timepiece were manufactured by the Verdin Company and are set by the National Research Council Time Signal. One level below, running around the circumference of the tower's shaft, is an observation deck. This was the highest accessible space in Ottawa until the early 1970s; the Peace Tower dominated the Ottawa skyline, as a strict 45.7 m (150 ft) height limit was placed on other buildings. That limit, however, was later rescinded, leading the Peace Tower to lose its distinction as the city's tallest structure. Cantilevered out at each of the four corners of the tower, at the level of the observation platform, are four 2.5 m (8 ft 4 in) long, 75 cm (2 ft 6 in) high, and 45 cm (1 ft 6 in) thick gargoyles made of Stanstead grey granite from Beebe, Quebec. South clock face and the glass windows of the observation deck below The tower's flagpole holds symbolic significance, acting as the flagpole of the nation. As such, strict protocol surrounds the display of banners atop the Peace Tower, such as half-masting for national mourning and showing the flag of the sovereign, that of any member of the Royal Family, or the flag of the governor general, when any of those persons are present on Parliament Hill. In 1981, a new inclined elevator was installed. It travels on a 10¬∞ angle for the first , shifting its position horizontally , and straight up for the remainder of the climb. The elevator car stays level at all times during its movement because it has a gimbal- mounted double frame. Before the installation of the new elevator, the observatory had been reached by taking first one elevator, then climbing a flight of stairs to a second elevator. =Memorial Chamber= The Peace Tower was designed by architect John A. Pearson not only to stand as an architectural feature and landmark, but also to function as a memorial to Canadians who had given their lives during the Great War. It thus houses the Memorial Chamber, a vaulted 7.3 m by 7.3 m (24 ft by 24 ft) room directly above the porte-cochere, with stained glass windows and various other features illustrating Canada's war record, such as the brass plates made from spent shell casings found on battlefields that were inlaid into the floor, and bore the name of each of Canada's major conflicts during the First World War. Stone that architect John Pearson personally collected from the main European battlefields where Canadians were killed is included in the floors and walls. Pearson described the room, also called the Memorial Chapel, as a \\"sacred grove in the middle of the forest.\\" The stone walls were originally to have been inscribed with the names of all Canada's servicemen and women who had died during the First World War; but, without enough space for all 66,000 names, it was later decided to place Books of Remembrance there instead; the books list all Canadian soldiers, airmen, and seamen who died in service of the Crown‚Äîwhether that of Britain (before 1931) or that of Canada (after 1931)‚Äîor allied countries in foreign wars, including the War of 1812, the Nile Expedition and Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, and the Korean War. The books are displayed in glass cases on seven altars around the chamber, the pages of each book turned at 11 a.m. daily so every name is on display to visitors at least once during each calendar year. Amidst the carved marble plaques detailing Canadian military involvement since Confederation, five marble plaques on display in the Memorial Room present literary passages. Two plaques contain (in English and French) \\"In Flanders Fields\\" by Canadian physician Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. One plaque has an excerpt from French-Canadian author Gabrielle Roy's novel Bonheur d'occasion (The Tin Flute). Psalm 139:8-10 from the Bible is etched on another plaque in both French and English. A fifth plaque is inscribed with the moving poem \\"On Going To The Wars\\" by Canadian writer Earle Birney: \\"On Going to the Wars\\" by Earle Birney, from the Memorial Chamber in the Peace Tower ::I go that we may breast ::again the Dorset ::downs in zest ::and walk ::the Kentish lanes ::where I began ::a larger life ::in knowing you. ::Yet ::if from seething sky ::I win reprieve ::but by the ::slowing crutch ::or whitened cane, ::my doom will yet ::have helped to hold ::in bloom ::old English orchards ::and Canadian woods ::unscarred by steel, ::Acadian ::and Columbian roofs ::unswept by flame. ::My mother ::will be kept ::from stumbling down ::a prairie road illumed ::by burning barns ::and snowed ::by patterned death. Sculpture Various elements within the room were formed with stone quarried from the battlefields of Europe: from the United Kingdom came Hoptonwood limestone; from Belgium, black marble for the wall plinths and altar steps, as well as St. Anne marble for the clustered columns that support the fan vault ceiling from each corner of the room; and from France, Ch√¢teau-Gaillard stone for the walls and the vault itself, as well as stone from Flanders' fields. These materials were worked into 700 carved elements by a number of different artists and sculptors under the direction of Ira Lake, who desired to tell not only the complete story of Canada's participation in the First World War, but also to commemorate military units as far back as the 17th century regime of New France. John Pearson's drawings for the new Centre Block of Parliament Hill, showing a section through the Memorial Chamber with elevation of the north wall and the staircase that rises behind it Around the entrance archway are The Sword of Victory‚Äîa bas-relief above the opening‚Äîand two stone lions by Pearson, the modeller Charles Adamson, and the sculptor Cl√©ophas Soucy, each bearing a shield; the shield to the left bears the Dragon of Destruction and the date 1914, while that on the right shows the Dove of Peace perched on a crown and the date 1918. Within the tympanum of the antechamber's arch is the sculpted work by Pearson and Soucy, The Tunnellers' Friends, which shows representations of animals that served during the war: reindeer, pack mules, carrier pigeons, horses, dogs, canaries, and mice, all above the inscription THE TUNNELLERS‚Äô FRIENDS, THE HUMBLE BEASTS THAT SERVED AND DIED. Around the archivolt at the other end of the entrance passage are sculpted animals and insects, such as beetles, spiders, lizards, butterflies, rats, hares, bats, birds, frogs, and bees; John Pearson stated that these were to represent the flora and fauna of Canada. The inscription around this arch is an excerpt from John Ceredigion Jones' poem The Returning Man: ALL'S WELL FOR OVER THERE AMONG HIS PEERS A HAPPY WARRIOR SLEEPS. The walls of the Memorial Chamber are divided into 17 niches designed by Ira Lake and A. Fortescue Duguid. Each contain a marble slab under a gothic blind arch topped with a gablet and finial, and decorated with various badges and insignia, including those of, on the mouldings: Canada's 178 pre-1914 militia regiments; in the pierced quatrefoil panels: cavalry, and non-infantry field units; in the diaper background: pre-Confederation French and British regiments and colonial forces; on the gablet crockets: reinforced battalions; on the gablet springers: all branches of the Canadian Corps; on the arch quatrefoil and cusps: Badges and insignia of Canada's 178 pre-1914 militia regiments: The Royal Canadian Dragoons, Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), The Governor General's Body Guard, 1st Hussars, 2nd Dragoons, 3rd The Prince of Wales' Canadian Dragoons; on the arch spandrels: medals and war decorations of the allied countries; on the shield: coats of arms appropriate to the relevant historical context; and on the low relief panel: historical scenes of Canadians during World War I. The marble panels themselves originally described the various campaigns and battles in the theatres of war between 1914 and 1918. These, however, were replaced in 1982 with panels illustrating the Canadian Forces' engagements from the Fenian Raids to the Korean War, along with excerpts from the Bible, poems, and other literature. Windows After John Pearson canvassed British artists in stained glass for designs for the Memorial Chamber's windows, he settled on Frank S.J. Hollister of Toronto for the task; Hollister's proposal was presented in 1925 to the Department of Public Works for the Governor-in-Council's approval. Each of the three 7 m by 3.5 m windows is divided into vertical quadrants by stone mullions and contain allegorical figures amongst heraldic symbols, including the Royal Arms of Canada, the arms of each of the provinces, and those of the United Kingdom. ; The Call to Arms This window displays four allegories: Victory, as a woman holding a crown and surrounded by a laurel branch and a helmet on a shield; Labour, a male figure amongst objects such as a shovel, spinning wheel, and astrolabe, with the motto Fortitudo Industria et Pax (Strength Industry and Peace); Progress, a man holding a book and quill, surrounded by a celestial crown, weighing scales, hourglass, and galley; and Science, a male holding a microscope and flask, amongst symbols such as a globe and torch, all below a ribbon indicating metallurgy, mineralogy, and chemistry. These four figures are arranged above four lower panels, the first showing three inscriptions: THANKS BE TO GOD WHO GIVE THUS THE VICTORY, from 1 Corinthians 15:57, FAITH UNTO DEATH, and ACQUIT YE LIKE MEN BE STRONG, both from 1 Corinthians 16:13. Also in this section is a crowd of people bearing shields and spears, who represent the people of Canada uniting in response to the call of the man shown in the second panel, who holds a sword and trumpet, calling \\"To Arms\\"; at his side is a child holding flowers, representing faith and courage. This section also displays the words THOU HAST GIRDED ME WITH STRENGTH UNTO THE BATTLE, from Psalm 18:39. In the third panel stands a woman supporting a rod entwined with winged serpents, the Rod of Asclepius, characterising the nurses of battle, and below her is the phrase TRUE WORTH THAT NEVER KNOWS IGNOBLE DEFEAT SHINES WITH UNDIMMED GLORY, taken from Horace's Odes. The fourth bay displays a group of men and horses congregating from farms, offices, and factories, while a fleet of ships rests at bay awaiting the men to carry them to war. Looking up the south face of the Peace Tower, showing one of the Memorial Chamber's windows, The Dawn of Peace ; The Assembly of Remembrance This is the south window, the first panel of which shows the archangel Michael holding a trumpet, representing the call to battle, and, above his head, a seated woman with children at her knee, symbolising the sacrifices of women and children in the name of liberty, honour, and justice, while in the lower portion an armoured figure bears the Crown of Victory in his hands. The second panel contains the inscriptions: AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL REMEMBER THEM, taken from the work of Laurence Binyon, and FREEDOM IS THE SURE POSSESSION OF THOSE ALONE WHO HAVE COURAGE TO DEFEND IT, from Pericles, as well as, in the lower portion, an armoured figure holding a flambeau, and, in the upper part, St. George slaying the dragon. The third panel contains Lady Justice bearing the Scales of Justice and the Great Sword of Judgement, the sword-guard of which shows a figure in a crucifixion pose‚Äîrepresenting suffering for both the victors and the defeated‚Äîand below her the words JUSTITIA LIBERTAS PERPETUO (Justice Liberty in Perpetuity). Beneath Lady Justice in this panel is the heroic figure of Canada wearing armour and helmet and holding the laurel wreath of victory, but looking mournfully at the Book of Remembrance, and behind her are two other persons, one symbolising Canadian motherhood and the other First Nations. The fourth quadrant shows Joan of Arc bearing a shield and standing before the royal coat of arms of France. ; The Dawn of Peace Similar to the other windows, this one shows four figures across the top portion. The first of these is the figure of the Victory of Peace, holding both a palm branch and the sword of judgement, while a dove flies overhead. The second person shown is that of Prosperity, who holds a wheat sheaf and a sicle, and, next to him, is Progress, bearing a winged wheel and with the Lamp of Knowledge above his head. The fourth figure is Plenty, symbolising the replenishment of both material and spirit through noble pursuit. Arranged in the lower portion of the window is a crowd of people assembled in peace and led by three figures in the foreground and bearing the symbols of their trades: Industry holds a mallet and dynamo, Agriculture bears a scythe, Honour carries a torch inscribed with words from John McCrae's poem In Flanders Fields: BE THE TORCH YOURS TO HOLD IT HIGH, and Motherhood, who is surrounded by children. At the base of the second and third panels are the phrases: HE MAKETH WARS TO CEASE, from Psalm 46:9, and JUDGEMENT SHALL RETURN UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS, from Psalm 94:15. =Carillon= Accompanying the Peace Tower clock is a 53-bell carillon, conceived by an act of parliament as a commemoration of the 1918 armistice that ended World War 1 and was inaugurated on 1 July 1927, the 60th anniversary of Confederation. The smallest of the bells weighs and the bourdon weighs , all cast and tuned by Gillett & Johnston in Croydon, England, and which are used by the Dominion Carillonneur for both regular recitals and to toll to mark major occasions such as state funerals and Remembrance Day. Each bell is stationary and is struck by its internal clapper, itself mechanically linked to the carillon keyboard, to create a note, a particular one on the music scale for each bell. In this way, the carillon plays similarly to a piano, allowing the carillonneur to change the sounds by varying the way he or she strikes the keys. History The tower under construction in 1921 Coming immediately after the destruction of the parliament buildings by fire in 1916, the Peace Tower's conception coincided with the end of the First World War. With this in mind, Prime Minister Robert Borden dedicated the site of the tower on 1 July 1917, with the words: \\"[the tower will be a] memorial to the debt of our forefathers and to the valour of those Canadians who, in the Great War, fought for the liberties of Canada, of the Empire, and of humanity.\\" Two years later, the Peace Tower's cornerstone was laid by Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), during his wider royal tour of Canada on September 1, 1919, and the structure was topped out in 1922. In the summer of 1925, an informal ceremony was held in the Memorial Chamber, where in Governor General of Canada the Viscount Byng of Vimy; Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King; Leader of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition Arthur Meighen; and the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces during World War I, the Earl Haig, laid the base stones of the clustered marble columns that support the fan vault ceiling. The Prince of Wales then returned to Ottawa again in 1927 to dedicate the altar of the Memorial Chamber and to inaugurate the Dominion Carillon, the first playing of which on that day was heard by listeners across the country on the first ever coast-to-coast radio broadcast in Canada. Upon completion, the Peace Tower stood as the tallest building in Ottawa as well as the whole of Canada. Starting in 1994, the Peace Tower was covered and the accessible spaces closed for a two-year conservation project aimed at reversing deterioration of the masonry and preventing further moisture penetration. However, the machinery of the clock was not within the scope of work and, on 24 May 2006, the clock stopped for the first time in 28 years, with the display inactive at 7:28 for about one day.

A hatch, an opening which may also be in a wall and need not be flush with the surface, is similar; in some cases either name is applicable. A small door in a wall, floor or ceiling used to gain access to equipment is called an access hatch or access door. History Omega, the last square-rigged sailing cargo ship Originally, trapdoors were sack traps in mills, and allowed the sacks to pass up through the mill while naturally falling back to a closed position. Many buildings with flat roofs have hatches that provide access to the roof. On ships, hatches are usually not flush, and never called trapdoors‚Äîprovide access to the deck. Cargo ships, including bulk carriers, have large hatches for access to the holds. Gallows Most 19th- and early 20th-century gallows featured a trapdoor, usually with two flaps. The victim was placed at the join. The edge of a trapdoor farthest from the hinge accelerates faster than gravity, so that the prisoner does not hit the flaps but falls freely. Railways The term trapdoor also refers to a plate in the entry vestibule of a passenger railcar that permits access to high-level platforms when lying flat against the floor of the car, and which can be flipped open to expose steps for accessing ground-level platforms. Many American commuter railroads which operate the Comet railcars made by Bombardier have trapdoors to accommodate passengers boarding and alighting on both high-level and ground-level platforms. Amtrak's Viewliner, Amfleet, and Horizon railcar fleets all have trapdoors. Biology Trapdoor spiders hide in an underground nest they line with their silk, and then conceal it with a hinged silk lid, the trapdoor. Star traps in theatre 19th century Star trap from the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, Now at the Victoria and Albert Museum In theatrical use, \\"star traps\\" allowed explosively fast appearances on stage, such as Jinn appearing in a puff of smoke. Fiction Hidden trapdoors occasionally appear in fiction, as entrances to secret passageways, dungeons, or to secret tunnels. They also appear as literal traps into which a hapless pedestrian may fall if they happen to step on one. A trapdoor features in a late scene of the 1963 film Charade. Cary Grant's character releases a trapdoor in the stage of a theatre to save Audrey Hepburn's character from Walter Matthau's character.https://www.filmsite.org/char.html See also * Trap (disambiguation) * Angstloch *Trapdoor function References External links Doors Parts of a theatre ","title":"Trapdoor"},{"id":"1371614","text":"Brian West (born June 10, 1978 in LaGrange, Georgia) is a retired American soccer striker.

Seet was born in Singapore to a Singaporean father and an Irish mother who emigrated to Canada shortly after he was born. He currently resides in Toronto, Ontario and has lived in Oxford and London, UK. Biography =Early life= Seet began singing in the church choir at St. Peter's Anglican Church in Cobourg, Ontario at age 4 and started piano lessons at 5. At 13 years old, he played the carillon at St. Peter's for several years. When he was 15, he was recruited as the church organist and choir director at St. George's Church in Grafton and Trinity Anglican Church Colborne, Ontario for 3 years before leaving for university. During this period, he played viola in the Northumberland Symphony Orchestra and was the president of his high school band in Cobourg. Seet briefly attended Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario but then transferred to Cobourg District Collegiate Institute East where his father was teaching. He was highly involved in musical productions and programs at both schools. He was accepted to several universities for music performance and composition programs but chose to study Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo whereupon he taught himself guitar and began songwriting. Upon graduating, Seet continued writing and recording songs while still working in various aspects of technology and performing in other Toronto bands. =Music career= He recorded and released Melatonin independently in 2000 and Arousal Disasters on February 14, 2003 with Aporia Records/MapleNationwide. Thanks To Science, We've Got Love was produced in 2007 but was only made available on iTunes and other digital audio formats in early 2008. The End of the Beginning EP, released in 2009, was similarly only made available digitally. The material from \\"Thanks To Science, We've Got Love\\" was largely derived from compositions pitched for television and film with Offensive Tie Publishing in Boston. Most of the work on \\"The End of the Beginning\\" was written and recorded in Oxford. Seet was one of the founders and organizers of Toronto's annual Jeff Buckley Tribute (2000‚Äì2003), and produces, records and performs for other artists and also composes music for film and television and advertising. His song, Precious Things, was used in the second episode of the Canadian television police drama, Flashpoint. Style His writing often employs arching melodies over top sometimes uncommonly used chords, voicing and song structure. His compositional style has changed over the course of his recordings but has maintained a signature production style. Earlier work (Melatonin (album), Arousal Disasters) was centered around conventional rock and pop instrumentation. More recent recordings include marrying symphonic elements with electronic/synth and rock instruments, as well as occasionally more simple arrangements with guitar or ukulele guitar (\\"Precious Things\\"). Songs vary from melancholic to anthemic with many of them drawing upon art rock and pop references.

Biography Hegarty, also known as Diane LaVey and Diana Hall, was born July 10, 1942. As well as being a self-described sorceress, Diane was co-founder with Anton LaVey of the Church of Satan and served as High Priestess for approximately 25 years. Anton LaVey divorced his first wife Carole and began a relationship with Hegarty that lasted 24 years, from 1960 to 1984. They had a child, Zeena Schreck (n√©e LaVey). At the end of their relationship Diane Hegarty sued for palimony. She appears in many of the filmed rituals of the Church. These have become stock footage for anyone desiring a depiction of Satanism. Along with her Satanic duties as hostess, model enchantress, mother and magician's wife, she helped Anton raise a lion cub named Togare. Hegarty administered the Church and typed and edited The Satanic Bible, The Satanic Rituals, The Compleat Witch (aka The Satanic Witch) and The Devil‚Äôs Notebook. She did most of the Church's administrative, press and member relations work. Their daughter Zeena Schreck was in the media spotlight at age 3, at her Satanic baptism, and again defending the Church of Satan against allegations of Satanic ritual abuse as public representative and High Priestess of the Church of Satan between 1985-1990 during the 1980s Satanic panic, the politically-motivated Christian fundamentalist witch-hunts in America.

It marks the feature- length screen debut for Kate Nelligan. The screenplay was written by Tom Stoppard and Thomas Wiseman. Caine plays a successful English novelist whose discontented wife, played by Jackson, decides to take a holiday to Germany in order to \\"find herself\\". There she meets a mysterious young man, played by Berger, in an elevator, which initiates an often bizarre, but extremely mature examination of desire, responsibility and the nature of love. The film was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition. Plot Elizabeth, bored wife of a successful pulp writer in England, leaves husband and child and runs away to the German town of Baden- Baden. There she meets Thomas, who claims to be a poet but whom viewers know to be a petty thief, conman, drug courier and gigolo. Though the two are briefly attracted to each other, she returns home. He, hunted by gangsters for a drug consignment he has lost, follows her to England. Lewis, highly suspicious of his wife, invites the young man to stay with them and act as his secretary. Initially resenting the presence of the handsome stranger, Elizabeth one night starts an affair and the two run away with no money to the south of France. Lewis follows them, he in turn being followed by the gangsters looking for Thomas. At the end the gangsters reclaim Thomas, presumably for execution, while Lewis reclaims Elizabeth.

It was founded in 1999 and published by Taegan Goddard , a former policy adviser to Democratic U.S. Senator Donald Riegle and Independent Governor Lowell Weicker, and the co-author of the 1998 political management book, You Won - Now What? How Americans Can Make Democracy Work from City Hall to the White House with political commentator Chris Riback. History As the son of a lawyer, teacher and writer, Goddard grew up in a household that regularly discussed politics and the role of journalists in communicating the behind the scenes workings of the government. He further cultivated that interest at Vassar College and the Harvard Kennedy School. He was inspired to create Political Wire by a print Wall Street Journal column called Washington Wire. In an interview with PR Week, called Making it in the Political Blogosphere Goddard explained why he created the site: \\"I do it for the same people who, going back a dozen years, always wanted that political page. So, in a practical sense, it‚Äôs for people who‚Äôre very similar to me, who like politics to the same degree that I do and also enjoy it almost as a game. While some people might read the sports page first every day, there‚Äôs a whole group of people who read Political Wire first every day, because that‚Äôs something that gets them going in the morning. Those people, I find, are professionally employed in politics or public affairs. They work either in political offices or on campaigns, or are elected and appointed officials themselves. In many cases they‚Äôre journalists who cover politics and, obviously, there are also the political junkies out there who just find it interesting.\\" Blog topics are typically drawn from a curated list of writers rather than websites although left and right sources including the Democratic forum Daily Kos and the conservative blog Hot Air provide additional perspectives. Readership Political Wire is officially non-partisan. Goddard described his website as \\"a place where you want to start your day and then return various times a day to find out what's going on in the world of politics... the people who read Political Wire tend to be the political insiders and political junkies, the lawmakers and their staffs, journalists, and people who make a living in the world of public affairs.\\" It is a subscription service with a nominal fee for membership. By 2016, it was attracting upwards of 10,000,000 readers per month. Goddard told Fishbowl DC that people sometimes get confused by his politics because he's fiercely independent in his views and \\"not a joiner by nature.\\" In the media In 2006, Goddard formed a content partnership with Congressional Quarterly. The partnership was expanded in early 2009 so that CQ sold all advertising on Political Wire. The agreement expired in 2013 and the site is still owned and published by Goddard. During the 2008 presidential election, PC Magazine named Political Wire one of the 20 best political web sites of 2008. In 2012, Time named @politicalwire as one of the top Twitter 140 Twitter feeds. Political Wire's Twitter site has also received acclaim outside the country and was named one of the \\"Top 50 US Politics Twitter Accounts to Follow.\\" The site has also been praised by political analysts such as Chuck Todd, Stuart Rothenberg, Charlie Cook and Larry Sabato.http://politicalwire.com/#links Goddard has appeared as a guest to discuss political headlines on The Daily Beast and MSNBC . He has been a panelist for numerous political roundtables. Related sites Goddard also created Taegan Goddard's Wonk Wire,http://wonkwire.com a site focused on the latest public policy news, Taegan Goddard's Political Dictionary,http://politicaldictionary.com which explores the language of politics, as well as Taegan Goddard's Political Job Hunt,http://politicaljobhunt.com which helps people interested in working in politics and public affairs. On January 13, 2013, Goddard agreed to maintain a daily blog for The Week, titled The Cloakroom.

In 1999, she opposed the merger of the Democratic Left into the Labour Party. In 2002, she was openly critical of Labour Party leader Ruairi Quinn following a poor showing by Labour in the 2002 Irish General Election.

Early and private life Healy-Rae was born outside Kilgarvan, County Kerry, the first of six children born to Daniel and Mary Healy, and he grew up on the family farm. The Rae part of his surname derives from the local townland where he was born, Reacaisleach. He was educated at the local National School in Kilgarvan. He emigrated to the United States in 1953 but soon returned to Ireland. He played for the local hurling and Gaelic football teams in Kilgarvan, where he won two senior county hurling titles with the club in 1956 and 1958. Healy-Rae was also a saxophone player with the Kilgarvan Dance Band. By the 1960s, he was well established in the plant hire business in south Kerry. In 1969, he became a publican when he purchased an old premises that had been closed for some time in Kilgarvan. The family pub is now run by his son, Danny. Healy-Rae was married to Julie Healy, but the couple separated in 1977. Two sons, Danny and Michael were members of Kerry County Council for the Killarney and Killorglin electoral areas respectively before becoming TDs. His eldest daughter Joan (Mrs. Larkin) teaches in a Catholic School in New York. His other daughter, Rosemary, is a barrister-at- law. She was appointed to a paid position on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal in 2007. She was re-appointed, for three further years, by Justice Minister Dermot Ahern on 11 November 2010. A son, Denis, runs his own business, and another son, John Healy (he does not use Rae), is a full- time official with and former President of the Garda Representative Association. Political career =Early involvement= Healy-Rae first became involved in politics in the 1960s. He headed several Fianna F√°il by- election campaigns, most notably the election of John O'Leary to the D√°il in 1966. O'Leary retained the seat for thirty-one years. Healy-Rae later lent his services to several other Fianna F√°il election campaigns in County Limerick, County Cork and County Galway. In 1973, Healy-Rae was first co-opted to Kerry County Council as a Fianna F√°il member, following the death of sitting Kerry County Councillor Michael Doherty. He was elected to the council in his own right in 1974 and re-elected in every subsequent election. Healy-Rae served on the council for 30 years, until he had to resign his seat because of the abolition of the dual mandate in 2003. During the 1970s and 1980s, Healy-Rae served three times as Fianna F√°il's director of elections in Kerry South. In this capacity he was given the task of delivering two of the three seats for the Fianna F√°il Party. =Election to D√°il √âireann= Healy-Rae broke from Fianna F√°il in controversial circumstances prior to the 1997 general election. When the party refused to nominate him as a candidate in Kerry South, he decided to run as an Independent candidate. This move surprised the party, with many commentators giving him little chance of getting elected. However, Healy-Rae took a seat and denied Fianna F√°il the chance of taking a second seat in the constituency. After the election, the Fianna F√°il and Progressive Democrats prospective government was still short of an overall majority. Healy-Rae was one of four Independent TDs (the others were Harry Blaney, Tom Gildea and Mildred Fox) who supported the government throughout its five-year term and rejectect the opposition Fine Gael. In return for this support he secured funding for projects in his constituency and chairmanship of the Environment committee. His policy approach could be defined as populist, primarily driven by his rural background and constituency, and he frequently demanded upgrades to public services such as schools and roads in his constituency as the price of his support for the government. Healy-Rae contested the 2002 general election and although his seat looked in doubt at some stages of the campaign and he received only the fourth-highest number of first-preference votes, he was narrowly re-elected, winning the third seat. He sat through fewer than half the meetings of an Oireachtas committee tasked with dealing with social welfare he received ‚Ç¨20,000 a year to chair. He got up and left during 25pc of the meetings of the committee leaving the vice- chairman, Charlie O'Connor, to oversee the meetings and absented himself entirely from a further 25pc of meetings, despite a convention that chairmen appointed by the government should fully chair all meetings. =External support for Fianna F√°il= He was again re-elected to the D√°il at the 2007 general election and signed a confidence and supply deal with Fianna F√°il. Promising to support the government in return for investment in the South Kerry constituency. The details of this deal were not made public. Healy-Rae has been criticised for not making the details of the deal public and for supporting the government over highly controversial cutbacks (in contrast to Finian McGrath who made the details public by entering his deal into the D√°il record and who withdrew his support from the government in 2008, over cutbacks in the health sector). He was confronted publicly by members of the Kerry Public Sector Workers Alliance about his continual support for cutbacks and for the Irish bank bailout. Healy-Rae said he was powerless as he had only one vote and that they \\"should talk to the Green Party that are making the big changes\\". Retirement On 26 June 2008, Healy-Rae announced that he intended to retire at the next general election. His son Michael Healy-Rae was selected as a candidate by the Healy-Rae organisation on 28 October 2010, and was elected at the 2011 general election. Death Healy-Rae died on 5 December 2014, at Kerry General Hospital in Tralee after a long illness.

In October 2017, Raja was elected as the vice- president of the Parliament of Norway, the second time in Norway's history that a Muslim has been elected to that office.  Early life  Born in Oslo into a family of Pakistani descent, he was raised in the St. Hanshaugen neighborhood in Oslo. His father Abdul Qayyum Raja (1937‚Äì ) was a factory worker who worked at the Christiania Spigerverk steel plant in Nydalen, while his mother Akthar Nasim (1949‚Äì ) was a homemaker. Raja describes his parents as someone who \\"used violence as a part of the parenting, violence was relatively common in my community\\". In 1992, at age 15 he was taken away from home due to the ongoing violence in the household. He was subsequently placed in a hospice for recovering drug-addicts, which he later would describe as a \\"hellish dump\\". After being relocated to a nearby orphanage, he dropped out of high school. After six months at the orphanage, he was allowed to move back home, after which his parents sent him to Pakistan. Upon his return to Norway, he re-enrolled in high-school and according to him \\"had his mind set on becoming a lawyer\\" after seeing Kevin Costner in the film JFK. = Education = After graduating from Foss Upper Secondary School, he enrolled at University of Southampton, and graduated with a degree in Human Rights and Behavioural Sciences in Law. Raja was in 2003 the first non-ethnic Norwegian to receive the Norway Scholar that have been rewarded since 1920 at University of Oxford, Wadham College and there he studied for the MSc degree in Psychology. He holds also an undergraduate degree in Criminology and Master of Law degree Cand.jur. degree from University of Oslo cum laude.  Career  He has worked as a criminal defense lawyer for four years and been civil case litigator for two. During his years as criminal defense lawyer he was appointed by the court to be lead defense lawyer on several murderer-cases, in and abroad of the country, and he also had the lead defense on several largest drug cases in Norwegian history. While working as lawyer Raja also took advantage of the position a famous lawyer gets by advocating civil rights for all, defending poor peoples rights and helping ethnic minorities fight injustice. In 2008 Raja was appointed by the Norwegian Government, King in Council, to be office bearer as Board Leader of Norwegian Immigration Appeals Board, equivalent to a judge in a refugee court. After this he also served as Police Prosecutor at National Police Immigration Service, and later was posted as Norwegian diplomat at Royal Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi, India. A member of the Norwegian Liberal Party, he was at the end of 2012 nominated as the top candidate for Akershus Venstre in the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election.Venstres stortingskandidater er klare Venstre.no, December 2, 2012 (in Norwegian) He is thus the first person in Norwegian politics with minority background to be nominated at top of a ballot-list for National parliament election. He was elected to the National Assembly in September 2013 for four years term. He was in June 2016 re-nominated by Akershus Venstre as their top- candidate for the general election that were held in September 2017. = Minister = Following the Progress Party's withdrawal from government in January 2020, Raja was appointed Minister of Culture and Sports, succeeding his party leader Trine Skei Grande, who had been appointed Minister of Education. One of his first major cases as minister, was to deal with restrictions regarding the spread of COVID-19 in the country regarding sports. Measures that where applied, were that football and other sports with audiences, should not have fully packed tribunes and that players should keep distance while playing. By May, the government lifted restrictions and allowed children's football to be in close contact while playing, effective 15 June. The month after, he expressed shock after learning that the NIF had lacked to make reports and work more effectively against racism. He demanded that they'd make a report on racism. The NIF expressed appreciation for Raja's initiative and that they will work constructively together to fight racism in sports. In July, the government allowed for foreign film production to take place in Norway, with Raja himself approving that Tom Cruise and the crew of Mission: Impossible 7 being allowed to shoot in M√∏re og Romsdal in August. In mid- August, he announced his final decision to run for the Liberal Party leadership to succeed outgoing Trine Skei Grande, becoming the second Liberal politician to announce their intention to seek the leadership after Sveinung Rotevatn. Raja was however open to becoming deputy leader if that's what the party required. On 23 August, he was designated deputy leader of the party, with Rotevatn as first deputy and Melby as party leader, unanimously by the party's election committee. At the party conference in September, he was elected second deputy leader, with Melby as leader and Rotevatn as first deputy, unopposed. On 30 September, the government announced that contact training for broad sports would be allowed from 12 October, and at the same time would allow for a larger field of audiences to attend matches. Raja also stated that every municipality should evaluate themselves whether or not it‚Äôs safe to allow contact training.  Advocacy and positions in public debate  Raja has been a well known person in the media since his days as student. From variety of position, spokesman for the Norwegian-Pakistani students, spokesman for the largest mosque in Norway - World Islamic Mission, positioned as famous lawyer and columnist at Aftenposten and Morgenbladet, he has been an eager debater in the Norwegian society. In the years 2009-2011 he organized a series of dialogue meetings at the House of Literature, with controversial topics, such as why there is hate among Muslims, Jews and homosexuals. In these debates the leaders of Norway from all position participated; ranging from at that time Norwegian Secretary of State Jonas Gahr St√∏re, the chief of PST, chief editors of largest Medias, even the Norwegian Royal Crown Prince. For this effort Raja was also rewarded the highest Freedom of Speech award. Raja has been a lifelong opponent of spanking and corporal punishment of children. This stems from his experiences as a child growing up in Norway, where he was subjected to severe cane-whipping by the local Koranic teacher at the mosque as well as corporal punishment by his Pakistani parents and as a result contacted child protective services on his own, who took him into protective care for six months.Article about Raja's book Talsmann (the spokesman) in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten, In response to revelations about child abuse in a Mosque, he called for Koranic teachers which are found to have beaten children to immediately leave Norway, stating that \\"they are not welcome\\". After a memorial service for the victims of the World Trade Center attack in 2001 (at the American Church, Frogner, Oslo), he said it is \\"important that moderate Muslims ... share the sorrow and distance ourselves from extremist violence and acts of terror\\". He has voiced opposition to forced marriages as well as marriages based on the caste system within the south-Asian community in Norway. Also an outspoken opponent of arranged marriages, of which he said in 2013; \\"it is essential to break up the marriage pattern in the Norwegian- Pakistani community, so that arranged marriages becomes uncommon\\". Raja founded the Norwegian think tank www.Minotenk.no and has as member of Parliament been both founding member of and member of the steering committee of International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief www.IPPFORB.COM  Personal life  Raja is married to psychologist Nadia Ansar. They first met while he was studying law, and she was studying psychology at the University of Oslo. They currently reside in the Ekeberg district of Oslo, along with their three children, twins Maya and Sara, and son Adam. Awards In 2010, Raja was awarded the Fritt Ord Award for freedom of speech. On 15 November 2017 he was named the 2018 recipient of the International Religious Liberty Association's International Award for Outstanding Leadership in Religious Freedom Advocacy.

When viewed in cross- section, a rabbet is two-sided and open to the edge or end of the surface into which it is cut. An example of the use of a rabbet is in a glazing bar where it makes provision for the insertion of the pane of glass and putty. It may also accommodate the edge of the back panel of a cabinet. It is also used in door and casement window jambs, and for shiplap planking. A rabbet can be used to form a joint with another piece of wood (often containing a dado). Rebate joints are easy to construct and have good appeal to them. They are simple to use in carpentry based work but can be doubtful when it comes to the strength of the joint. Nails and screws can be added to help increase the overall strength.  Etymology  The word rabbet is from Old French rabbat, \\"a recess into a wall\\", and rabattre \\"to beat down\\".

For each word in the passphrase, five rolls of the dice are required. The numbers from 1 to 6 that come up in the rolls are assembled as a five-digit number, e.g. 43146. That number is then used to look up a word in a word list. In the English list 43146 corresponds to munch. By generating several words in sequence, a lengthy passphrase can be constructed. A Diceware word list is any list of 6^5 = 7\\\\,776 unique words, preferably ones the user will find easy to spell and to remember. The contents of the word list do not have to be protected or concealed in any way, as the security of a Diceware passphrase is in the number of words selected, and the number of words each selected word could be taken from. Lists have been compiled for several languages, including Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Maori, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. The level of unpredictability of a Diceware passphrase can be easily calculated: each word adds 12.9 bits of entropy to the passphrase (that is, \\\\log_2(6^5) bits). Originally, in 1995, Diceware creator Arnold Reinhold considered five words (64 bits) the minimal length needed by average users. However, starting in 2014, Reinhold recommends that at least six words (77 bits) should be used. This level of unpredictability assumes that a potential attacker knows that Diceware has been used to generate the passphrase, knows the particular word list used, and knows exactly how many words make up the passphrase. If the attacker has less information, the entropy can be greater than 12.9 bits per word. The above calculations of the Diceware algorithm's entropy assume that, as recommended by Diceware's author, each word is separated by a space. If, instead, words are simply concatenated, the calculated entropy is slightly reduced due to redundancy; for example, the three-word Diceware phrases \\"in put clammy\\" and \\"input clam my\\" become identical if the spaces are removed. EFF wordlists The Electronic Frontier Foundation published three alternative English diceware word lists in 2016, further emphasizing ease-of-memorization with a bias against obscure, abstract or otherwise problematic words; one tradeoff is that typical EFF- style passphrases require typing a larger number of characters. Snippet The original diceware word list consists of a line for each of the 7,776 possible five-die combinations.

This gigantic structure was built during the Sassanid era (224‚Äì651). The Khoramabad River runs past the eastern and south-western side of the Falak-ol-Aflak hill providing the fortress some natural protection on those sides. Today, the western and northern sides of the hill are bordered by the residential districts of Khorramabad. History Falak-ol-Aflak castle is amongst the most important structures built during the Sassanid era. It has been known by a number of names since it was built over 1800 years ago. Recorded names have referred to it as Shapur-Khast or Sabr-Khast fortress, Dezbaz, Khoramabad castle, and ultimately the Falak-ol- Aflak Castle. Under the Pahlavi dynasty, after being used as a prison until 1968, it was transformed into a museum complex. Architectural layout The foundations of the actual castle measure approximately . The height of the entire structure, including the hill, reaches to 40 meters above the surrounding area. The castle itself covers an area of . The perimeter extends for in perimeter and its tallest wall is 22.5 metres high. This space is divided into four large halls, and their associated rooms and corridors. The rooms all surround two courtyards with the following measurements: the first courtyard measures and the second . When originally built the castle used to have 12 towers, but only eight remain standing today. The building's entrance is situated towards the north, within the body of the northwestern tower. The water well of the fortress lies in the area behind the first courtyard. Reaching a depth of 40 meters, the majority of the well's shaft is carved into the rock in order to reach the source of the Golestan spring. The well remains usable to this day. The materials used in the construction of the fortress are mud-bricks, mud-fired bricks, stone, wood, and mortar. Panorama of Falak ol aflak Castle = Surrounding structures = Archaeological studies have identified the existence of a two layered rampart with twelve towers around the present day construction. This surrounding rampart mainly stretched westward. From the twelve original towers, only two remain and these are situated northwest and southwest of the existing fortress.Falak ol aflak castle is in center of Khorramabad city = Dehumidifier = Falak ol-Aflak Castle appears to have been built with a dehumidifier system. Previously, the experts believed these dehumidifier canals with a height of more than 1 meter covering all the area beneath the castle were hide-outs for the residents. But in reality, due to being aware of the changing climate in the region and the underground waters, the Sassanid engineers have equipped the castle with a dehumidifier. Falak ol-Aflak castle is made with different materials like stone and wood that are vulnerable to humidity. That is why the castle was built on the highest point of the city of Khoram-abad, so that the wind could penetrate the building and dry its foundations.

He made a brief comeback, playing in one further match in 1815. Overall, Lord made 90 known appearances in first-class cricket. He was mostly associated with Middlesex and with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) as a ground staff bowler. Lord is best remembered as the founder of Lord's Cricket Ground. Early life Lord was born in Thirsk, Yorkshire, in what is now the town museum. His father was a Roman Catholic yeoman, who had his lands sequestered for supporting the Jacobite rising in 1745 and afterwards he had to work as a labourer. The Lord family later moved to Diss, Norfolk, where Thomas Lord was brought up. Once he was out of childhood, Lord moved to London and got a job as a bowler and general attendant at the White Conduit Club in Islington. Career Lord is known to have begun playing about 1780 but his first recorded game was on his \\"own ground\\", now referred to as Lord's Old Ground, at the current site of Dorset Square on 31 May 1787 when he played for Middlesex v. Essex. Lord has never been given much credit as a player but the match records of the 1790s indicate that he was a very good bowler, although it is true that his opposition was not always of the highest standard. In 1786 Thomas Lord was approached by George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea, and Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, who were the leading members of the White Conduit Club. They wanted Lord to find a more private venue for their club and offered him a guarantee against any losses he might suffer. In May 1787, Lord acquired seven acres (28,000 m¬≤) off Dorset Square and started his first ground. White Conduit relocated there and soon afterwards formed, or merged into, the new Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The lease on the first ground ended in 1810 and Lord obtained an eighty-year lease on two fields, the Brick and Great Fields at North Bank, St John's Wood. The second venue, now referred to as Lord's Middle Ground, was built by 1809 when the first games were played there by St John's Wood Cricket Club. This was later merged into MCC who relocated to the Middle Ground in 1811. In 1813 Parliament requisitioned the land for the Regent's Canal, which was cut through the site, thereby necessitating a further move. Lord's third ground The Tavern Stand at Lord's Cricket Ground as it looks today. Lord then moved his ground to the present site in St John's Wood, literally taking his turf with him. It opened in 1814. Lord was not, however, making enough money and therefore obtained permission to develop part of the ground for housing, a move which would have left only 150 square yards of playing area. To counter his plan, Lord was bought out for ¬£5,000 by prominent MCC member William Ward, a noted batsman who was also a director of the Bank of England. Despite the change of ownership, the ground has continued to bear Lord's name. Retirement St John the Evangelist, West Meon Lord remained in St John's Wood till 1830 when he retired to West Meon in Hampshire, where he died in 1832. His son, also Thomas Lord, and born in Marylebone on 27 December 1794, was also a first-class cricketer. Thomas Lord is buried in the churchyard of St John's Church at West Meon. The village has a public house named after him and is just a few miles from Hambledon, home of the famous Hambledon Cricket Club.

Her successor (AGB-5003) has the same name. She was decommissioned in July 2008, and is expected to revive under the new owner as a facility for observation and exhibition regarding weather and environment. She was launched in December 1981, and was commissioned in November 1982 to succeed to Fuji (AGB-5001). Since November 1983, she served in 25 Antarctic expeditions. She was able to move at 3 knots breaking 1.5 meters of ice. In 2008, the government began to invite public contribution of plans to utilize this ship after the scheduled retirement. As to the first invitation, however, none of the plans was adopted mainly due to prime cost and problem on securing safety. In October 2008, after the retirement, the government once decided to scrap this ship. Nevertheless, there were requests of preserving Shirase sent to the authority, even from ordinary people who were not engaged in the Antarctic project. And, the mean price of iron scrap was declining since the summer of 2008. In 2009, the government again accepted public applications from 17 July to 11 September. Four parties submitted plans, and a plan by a weather information company Weathernews Inc. was adopted by 9 November 2009. On its website, Weathernews says it hopes to rename it as \\"SHIRASE\\" (not in hiragana but in Latin alphabet capitals) and to utilize it as a facility for monitoring the polar circles, for observing weather around Tokyo and for exhibitions, discussions and experiences on climate changes and global environment. On 10 February 2010, the ship was handed over to Weathernews. Weathernews officially took over the vessel on 11 February 2010.  Naming  In Japanese, the name \\"Shirase\\" is written in hiragana. This name was adopted from among about 62,000 entries from the public. Officially, this name is said to have been taken from Shirase Glacier. (Due to a JMSDF internal naming rule, an icebreaker was to take a name from a place.) This glacier bears the family name, which is written in kanji, of Lieutenant Nobu Shirase, a Japanese pioneer of Antarctic exploration.

It is considered one of the three best medical schools in the country and a premier medical research center. Its main campus is located in a charming old coffee farm in the outskirts of the city, with a total built area of , including a small lake. It has a central building with the main departments for the basic medical sciences and an adjoining University Hospital, with 847 beds. In 2003, the hospital provided in-patient care to 33,973 persons and out-patient (ambulatory) care to approximately 588,000. All medical care is provided free of charge. History Crest of arms of the School of Medicine The Ribeir√£o Preto Medical School was the third founded in the state of S√£o Paulo and the first outside the capital. In 1951, the state government supported the creation of the school as a way of promoting a better coverage of physicians to the rapidly growing cities in its hinterland. A committee was formed in the University of S√£o Paulo to study and to propose the new school. A professor from the University, physician and parasitologist Dr. Zeferino Vaz was nominated as its chairman and later became the Faculty's first dean, remaining until 1964. With great foresight, and against many resistances of the traditional medical academic establishment, he advocated a modern, research- based school, with all professors with full-time dedication. This was unheard of at that time in Brazil: in this Vaz was trying to follow the most successful American medical schools, such as Johns Hopkins Medical School. Lacking the researchers and professors with the mentality and experience he needed, he resorted to inviting them from Europe and United States. The school campus was established in a beautiful wooded area in the outskirts of Ribeir√£o Preto, which was formerly the seat of a state technical agricultural school, and before that, a coffee farm. In the beginning, since the city still lacked adequate resources for housing the professors, several houses in a Mediterranean style were built and furnished for free, thus compensating for the relatively small salaries that were paid to them at that time. By means of such drive to excellence, soon the School of Medicine of Ribeir√£o Preto achieved prominence and a unique status in Brazil. In 2013, it, along with the S√£o Paulo Research Foundation, made plans to begin testing an HIV vaccine, HIVBr18, in monkeys.

Praem. (January 17, 1913 - January 31, 2003), was a Dutch Roman Catholic priest and social activist. He was a Premonstratensian priest expatriate in Germany, who became known for his humanitarian work, particularly as founder of the international Catholic association Aid to the Church in Need. He was known affectuously as the \\"Bacon Priest\\". Ecclesiastical career Born in Mijdrecht, Netherlands, he originally intended to become a teacher and enrolled at the University of Utrecht in 1932 to study Classical Philology. There he was also editor in a student newspaper and co-founder of a political party, which had only a short existence. He decided instead to follow a religious life and in 1934 entered the Premonstratensian Tongerlo Abbey, of the Norbertine Order, in the province of Antwerp, in Belgium, taking the religious name Werenfried, in honour of an early Medieval Germanic saint. He became the abbot's secretary, after a bout of tuberculosis that left him too weak for missionary work. He was ordained a priest on 25 July 1940.Obituary of Father Werenfried van Straaten, The Daily Telegraph (London, England), Feb. 1, 2003 =Humanitarian work= He first rose to public attention at Christmas, 1947, when he wrote an article entitled \\"Peace on Earth? No Room at the Inn,\\" in which he appealed to all faithful to help the fourteen million German civilians displaced from the east at the end of World War II, six million of whom were Roman Catholics. These refugees and expellees resided in very primitive camps, mostly former Nazi concentration camps or Allied POW camps located in the western occupation zones of Germany and - for a minority - in the Netherlands and Belgium, and suffered from malnutrition and lack of medical care. The response to the article of Van Straaten was unexpectedly generous, proving charity still existed and hatred was lessening towards the former enemies. He earned his nickname, \\"Bacon Priest\\" () due to his appeals to Flemish farmers for contributions of food for the German refugees, appeals which met with considerable amounts of meat being donated. His next concern was the pastoral care of the six million displaced Catholics, some of which were housed in purely Protestant areas, without their own churches and pastors. With the action \\"A vehicle for God\\" he converted used buses and trucks into mobile altars. In 1953, van Straaten called the International Building Order into being to motivate students to help refugees and displaced persons build their own homes in Germany. This initial work led to the formation of Aid to the Church in Need (Kirche in Not), centered in K√∂nigstein, Germany, in 1952. After 1950, he was active in Catholic relief work worldwide, through church appeals, public speaking, and his newsletter, The Mirror, which he began publishing in 1953. After the plight of the expellees in the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany was largely alleviated, his concern became the persecuted church in the now communist- dominated Eastern Europe. After the collapse of the Soviet regime, he tried to bridge the trenches to the Catholic Church, through generous help to the Russian Orthodox Church. Werenfried van Straaten succeeded in combining social engagement with dedication to the proclamation of the faith. For his life's work he was honored many times by the church and the state. He also wrote a number of books, including They Call Me The Bacon Priest (1960). In his later years he was active in anti-abortion activism, demonstrating and speaking out against abortion in Western Europe and the United States. He died on January 31, 2003 at Bad Soden in Germany at the age of 90 years. He is buried in the cemetery of K√∂nigstein im Taunus. Werenfried Prize At the 3rd International Congress Treffpunkt Weltkirche, held from 11 to 13 April 2008, in Augsburg, the Father Werenfried Prize was awarded for the first time to the Friends of the St. Clemens Church in Berlin. This prize, endowed with 1000 euros, was awarded jointly with the Katholische Sonntagszeitung.

Early years √ñzel is a son of a police officer from S√∂ke. He attended primary and secondary school in Kastamonu, √áankƒ±rƒ± and Ankara. He attended classes at Political Science Faculty of Ankara University, and graduated from the French Language department of Hacettepe University. Career √ñzel published Halkƒ±n Dostlarƒ± magazine with Ataol Behramoƒülu. √ñzel's songs of freedom derived its content from socialism but their structure and symbolism reflected the tastes of the Second New Generation movement in Turkish poetry. In the 1970s, √ñzel developed a mystic and Islamist view which shocked his leftist audience. He worked as a French lecturer in the State Conservatory. He spent all his time writing after he retired. Because of both his interesting character and works, he took an impressive place among his contemporaries. √ñzel, who published his early poems in 1963, became salient with densely using images and his meticulous effort to choose words. He collected his early poems in the book called Geceleyin Bir Ko≈üu (A Run in the Night, 1966), in which he searches the truth of being human. His attributions about gathering the innovations and experimental sides of Turkish Poetry with social realism and his success to realize it caused to his second book called Evet ƒ∞syan (Yes, Rebel, 1969) made big echoes. In 1970, he published Halkƒ±n Dostlarƒ± review with Ataol Behramoƒülu. In fact, Ataol Behramoƒülu purified his poetry by leaving out crude propaganda and naive didacticism. ƒ∞smet √ñzel, perhaps the most talented of the group, turned to Islam for inspiration, but preserved the revolutionary bravura of his Marxist days. In following years, ƒ∞smet √ñzel experienced great changes in his political and philosophical approaches, and dedicated himself to the Islamic thought. When asked by his friend Murat Belge, a noted socialist intellectual, the reason for his conversion, √ñzel replied, \\"a man looks either after his freedom or his security, but he cannot acquire one without the other. All my life has been a search for ontological security. I am convinced that I found this security in the Qur'an. Islam is a healing for me. Those who either have no wounds or are not aware of their wounds will have no need for this healing.\\" However, √ñzel is convinced that mankind is sick. In Three Problems: Technology, Civilization and Alienation and in To Speak in Difficult Times and also It Is Prohibited to Eat the Stones, √ñzel argues that mankind is from an acute alienation which is a result of destructive technology, artificial division of man and nature, and the enlightened principles of Islam which emphasize the synthesis of the sacred and the profane is the only medicine available for this disease. Three Problems is one of the most influential books of recent times in Turkey. Another following twenty years, he claimed that he broke the ties with the Islamic Media. His third work called Cinayetler Kitabƒ± (The Book of Murders, 1975) was a perfect example of his quality in writing poems which it emphasizes the dedication to his early works. In addition to putting his understanding of poetry, the book called ≈ûiir Okuma Kƒ±lavuzu (The Handbook of Reading a Poem, 1980) also points an still being a research field: the contemporary position of Turkish Poetry. In the book called Celladƒ±ma G√ºl√ºmserken (When I Smile at My Executioner, 1984), the main borders of ƒ∞smet √ñzel's poetic world clarified, he collected all his poems in the book Erbain / Kƒ±rk Yƒ±lƒ±n ≈ûiirleri (Erbain - The Poems of 40 Years, 1987). Except newspaper works, starting from 1960, he published his poems and works in Devinim 60, Papir√ºs, Yeni Dergi, ≈ûiir Sanatƒ±, Halkƒ±n Dostlarƒ± (1964‚Äì71), Dirili≈ü, Mavera, G√∂steri, etc. The most notable of these is undoubtedly the column he had in newspapers of Yeni Devir (1977‚Äì79 and 1981‚Äì82), beginning from 1981-82 / 1985 partially in the Mill√Æ Gazete, moreover also in the Yeni ≈ûafak newspaper. Both in these works and his first essay book called √ú√ß Mesele (In Three Problems: Technology, Civilization and Alienation) (1978), he defended that Muslims had to be dependent to the Islamic sources itself. He claimed that this is the most realistic and rightful effort in the conditions that is far and away from Islamic Sources. He won the Writers' Union Turkey's Essay Award (1985) and Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral Award (1995) with his book Ta≈ülarƒ± Yemek Yasak (It Is Prohibited to Eat the Stones). He told his views about intellectual agenda in the television program ƒ∞smet √ñzel'le Ba≈üba≈üa (Alone with ƒ∞smet √ñzel) which was hosted by ƒ∞smail Kara on Channel 7. √ñzel has aimed at a new awareness of social responsibilities. In the 1970s, he adopted a mystical view of life without losing the strength of expression and inventiveness which he had evolved during his socialist period. He has drawn upon his knowledge of Western philosophy, Marxist sociology, and radical Islamist political theory to advocate a modern Islamic perspective that does not hesitate to criticize genuine societal ills while simultaneously remaining faithful to the ethical values and spiritual dimensions of religion. √ñzel, a Marxist convert to Islam: \\"I did not consider myself a part of the society I was in‚Äîbut as a candidate for the courageous and uncompromising defense of the cause of the just.\\" ƒ∞smet √ñzel, an ex-Marxist convert and the most prominent Islamist intellectual, argued that it was Atat√ºrk's reforms that, ironically Islamicized Turkey by forcing people to internalize and value their religious identity and not simply take it for granted as in the past. According to him, \\"Muslim is a terrorist. The first duty of the Muslim is to be a terrorist. Infidels will be afraid of Muslims. When they are not afraid, a Muslim is not a Muslim.\\"ƒ∞smet √ñzel \\"M√ºsl√ºmanlar Ter√∂risttir\\" (in Turkish): \\"M√ºsl√ºman ter√∂risttir. M√ºsl√ºman'ƒ±n ilk vazifesi ter√∂rist olmaktƒ±r. K√¢firler M√ºsl√ºmanlardan korkacaktƒ±r. Korkmadƒ±klarƒ± zaman M√ºsl√ºman, M√ºsl√ºman deƒüildir.\\" He stated that \\"I accept that by being a Muslim, the entire non-Muslim world is lower than me. So I am a Muslim and everyone who is not a Muslim is a lower person than me. As with all other religions, they can only be tolerated as a human, if not Muslim.\\"\\"M√ºsl√ºman olmayan herkes benden daha d√º≈ü√ºk bir insandƒ±r.\\" ƒ∞smet √ñzel (in Turkish): \\"Ben M√ºsl√ºman olmakla b√ºt√ºn gayrim√ºslim d√ºnyanƒ±n benim altƒ±mda olduƒüunu kabul ediyorum. Yani ben bir M√ºsl√ºman'ƒ±m ve M√ºsl√ºman olmayan herkes benden daha d√º≈ü√ºk bir insandƒ±r. B√ºt√ºn diƒüer dinler olduƒüu gibi insan olarak da, yani M√ºsl√ºman deƒüilse sadece ho≈üg√∂r√ºlebilir.\\" He wrote a poem titled, Of not being a Jew, in which he lamented the fact that he felt like a pursued Jew, but had no second country to go to. \\"Your load is heavy / He's very heavy / Just because he's your brother / Your brothers are your pogroms / When you reach the doorsteps of your friends / Starts your Diaspora,\\" he wrote. \\"As a political system in Turkey, socialism is possible, Turkism is probable, Islam is certain\\", however in a recent article he defended the isolation of Muslims from the society unless they adapt to the secular democracy, and emphasized Islam as a political system in Turkey is dead.http://www.dipnot.tv/10254/ikna- odalarina-giren-ogrenciler-cok-kizacak-ismet-ozel-ikna-odalari-tutarli-bir- isti.aspx Bibliography =Poetry= #Geceleyin Bir Ko≈üu (A Run in the Night) #Evet, ƒ∞syan (Yes, Rebellion) #Cinayetler Kitabƒ± (The Book of Murders) #Celladƒ±ma G√ºl√ºmserken (When I Smile at My Executioner) #Erbain (The Poems of 40 Years) #Bir Yusuf Masalƒ± (A Yusef Fairytale) #√áatlƒ±ycak Kadar A≈ük√Æ (Enough Love to Crack) #Of Not Being A Jew =Books= #√ú√ß Mesele (Three Problems) #Zor Zamanda Konu≈ümak (Speaking in Hard Times) #Ta≈ülarƒ± Yemek Yasak (It is Prohibited to Eat the Stones) #Bakanlar ve G√∂renler (Lookers and Seers) #Faydasƒ±z Yazƒ±lar (Useless Writings) #ƒ∞rtica Elden Gidiyor (Reaction is Getting Out of Hand) #Surat Asmak Hakkƒ±mƒ±z (Our Right to Frown) #Tehdit Deƒüil Teklif (An Offer Not a Threat) #Waldo Sen Neden Burada Deƒüilsin?

He created several characters who are now famous, such as The Toff (The Honourable Richard Rollison), Commander George Gideon of Scotland Yard, Inspector Roger West, The Baron (John Mannering), Doctor Emmanuel Cellini and Doctor Stanislaus Alexander Palfrey. The most popular of these was Gideon of Scotland Yard, who was the basis for the television series Gideon's Way and for the John Ford movie Gideon's Day (1958). The Baron character was also made into a 1960s TV series starring Steve Forrest as The Baron. Life and career John Creasey was born in Southfields, Surrey, to a working-class family. He was the seventh of nine children of Ruth and Joseph Creasey, a poor coach maker. Creasey was educated at Fulham Elementary School and Sloane School, both in London. From 1923 to 1935 he worked various clerical, factory, and sales jobs while trying to establish himself as a writer. After a number of rejections, Creasey's first book was published in 1930. His first crime novel, Seven Times Seven, was published in January 1932 by Melrose. It was a story about a gang of criminals. In 1935 he became a full-time writer. In 1937 alone, twenty-nine of his books were published. A phenomenally fast writer, he once suggested that he could be shut up in a glass-box and write there a whole book. In 1938, he created the character The Toff with the first novel Introducing the Toff. The Toff series would continue for 59 novels from 1938 to 1978. The Toff, The Honourable Richard Rollison, is an aristocrat and an amateur sleuth. (\\"Toff\\" is a British slang expression for an aristocrat.) During World War II, he created the character of Dr. Stanislaus Alexander Palfrey, a British secret service agent, who forms Z5, a secret underground group that owes its allegiance to the Allies. The first novel of the Dr. Palfrey 34-book series was Traitor's Doom, published in 1942 by John Long Ltd., while the last was The Whirlwind in 1979. Several adaptations were made of Creasey's novels. On film these included: Salute the Toff (1952, also known as Brighthaven Express in the USA), Hammer the Toff (1952), John Ford's Gideon's Day (1958, also known as Gideon of Scotland Yard in the USA), released by Columbia Pictures, and Cat & Mouse (1958, also known as The Desperate Men in the USA), written as Michael Halliday. On television, a series based on the Commander George Gideon character, Gideon's Way, was produced from 1964 to 1965 by ITC Entertainment and starring John Gregson in the title r√¥le. ITC followed this with a version of Creasey's The Baron character (1965‚Äì66), starring Steve Forrest. Between 1967 and 1971 the BBC produced a radio version of Creasey's Roger West stories with actor Patrick Allen in the title role as Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Roger \\"Handsome\\" West, with Allen's real-life wife Sarah Lawson playing the role of West's wife Janet. In 1962, Creasey won an Edgar Award for Best Novel, from the Mystery Writers of America (MWA), for Gideon's Fire, written under the pseudonym J. J. Marric. In 1969 he received the MWA's greatest honour, the Grand Master Award. He served one term as president of the organization in 1966, one of only three non-American writers to be so honoured. Creasey had as many publishers as he had pseudonyms, but enjoyed enduring relations with John Long and Hodder & Stoughton in the UK. After he finally broke into the American market in the 1950s, many of his books were released by Harper and Scribners; Walker reissued many older titles in the revised editions. He died at Salisbury, Wiltshire in 1973. In 2007, his family transferred all of Creasey's copyrights and other legal rights to Owatonna Media. Owatonna Media on-sold these copyrights to Coolabi Plc in 2009, but retained a master licence in radio and audio rights. These rights are commercially licensed in the UK and abroad. =Richard Creasey= John's son Richard Creasey is also an author as well as a distinguished television producer, having served both in the private sector and at the BBC, and as the British producer of Patrick Watson's worldwide Canadian television documentary series The Struggle for Democracy. He has developed his father's \\"Doctor Palfrey\\" series by penning a new series of techno-thrillers around the character of Doctor Thomas Palfrey. Crime Writers' Association (CWA) In 1953, John Creasey founded the Crime Writers' Association (CWA) in the UK. The CWA New Blood Dagger is awarded in his memory, for first books by previously unpublished writers; sponsored by BBC Audiobooks, it includes a prize of ¬£1000. This award was known previously as the John Creasey Memorial Dagger. Pseudonyms His pseudonyms include: * Gordon Ashe * Henry St. John Cooper * Credo * Norman Deane * Robert Caine Frazer * Patrick Gill * Michael Halliday * Charles Hogarth (with Ian Bowen) * Brian Hope * Colin Hughes * Kyle Hunt * Abel Mann * Peter Manton * J.J.

Reilly, and Jimmy Wilde. Romantic novels under the names of Margaret Cooke, M.E. Cooke, and Elise Fecamps. Political career As well as being an author, Creasey was a committed Liberal party member though he later became an independent.\\"Man of Mystery\\", Ian Millsted, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 57, Winter 2007‚Äì08 He said that he had been organising Liberal street-corner meetings from the age of 12. At the time of the 1945 general election Creasey was Chairman of the local Liberal Association in Bournemouth where his publicity and writing skills were instrumental in helping the Liberals to an atypical second place. He was adopted as prospective parliamentary candidate for Bournemouth West in 1946 and appeared on the platform at the 1947 Liberal Assembly, which was held in Bournemouth. He fought Bournemouth West in the 1950 general election, coming third. He became increasingly unhappy with the party through the 1950s though and disagreed so much with the party's policy concerning the Suez Crisis he resigned his membership. However, after the Orpington by-election success of 1962 and impressed with Jo Grimond's leadership of the party he seemed to be reviving his Liberal activity. By January 1966 however, he had founded the All Party Alliance, a pressure group which sought to unite the best people from all parties. The platform of the All Party Alliance was based on running industry by councils made up of workers, managers, investors and government to avoid industrial action, with a mind to eventually eliminate income tax.Man of Mystery, Ian Millsted, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 57, Winter 2007-08 Creasey fought by-elections as an independent in support of this idea in 1967 at Nuneaton, Brierley Hill and Manchester Gorton. He also fought Oldham West during the by-election of June 1968. He did well for an independent with the first-past-the-post system, having limited resources and often little time to campaign. In Oldham West he beat his old party's candidate into fourth place. He could not seem to shed his affection for the Liberal party however, congratulating Birmingham Ladywood by-election victor Wallace Lawler in July 1969 and attending the 1969 party assembly albeit to promote All Party Alliance aims. In 1972 he relaunched the All Party Alliance as Evolution to Democracy (Evo). Evo merged with Colin Campion's \\"The Organisation\\", a Yorkshire-based party which advocated coalition governments based on the proportion of votes cast for each party, to form the \\"Independent Democratic Alliance\\", which soon faded after Creasey's death, and its poor performance in the February 1974 general election.F. W. S. Craig, Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections Honours He was awarded the Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services in the United Kingdom's National Savings Movement during World War II.

Homewood is bordered on the southwest by the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway which follows the old Pennsylvania Railroad line toward downtown Pittsburgh. Geography Homewood is located in the easternmost part of Pittsburgh, bordered on the east by East Hills, on the west by Larimer, on the North by Lincoln-Lemington Belmar, and on the south by North Point Breeze. History Homewood was founded in 1832 by Judge William Wilkins. It was later annexed by the city of Pittsburgh on December 1, 1884. Homewood in the beginning held mainly estates for the wealthy; Homewood was also the Pittsburgh residence of industrialists Andrew Carnegie and Thomas M. Carnegie until the late 1880s. Starting in the 1910s, Irish, Italian, German, and upper middle class black families started moving into Homewood due to the low-cost of housing. This caused Homewood to become more diverse. At first relations between the white and black residents of Homewood were quite good, it was not until later that tensions between the different ethnic groups became more strained. In the 1950s the city claimed land in the Lower Hill District for the Civic Arena, and in the process, displaced 8,000 people. Most of them were less affluent blacks who then settled in rental apartments in Homewood, creating a large disparity in the number of blacks to whites in the region. This sudden influx of black residents caused a lot of the white middle class to move away from Homewood, creating a population shift from 22% black in 1950 to 66% black in 1960. As a result of the area being predominantly African-American, it was greatly affected by the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on 4 April 1968, whose murder caused riots in Homewood. The riots caused great damage to local businesses, severely crippling the business district there. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Homewood‚Äôs identity and reputation were further degraded by the proliferation of gangs dealing in illegal drugs. The Homewood-Brushton Revitalization and the Development Corporation put together a strong effort to rebuild the area, it accomplished this by building homes and helping to open new businesses. Demographics The 2000 Census demographics of the neighborhood are 98.3% African American, 0.6% White, 0.3% Asian, 0.0% American Indian, and 0.8% from 2 or more races. The 2010 Census demographics of Homewood are 97.8% African American, 1.2% White, 0.3% American Indian, 0.15% Asian, 0.04% Native Hawaiian, and 0.37% other. Neighborhoods Homewood is officially divided into three neighborhoods: Homewood North, Homewood South and Homewood West. *Homewood North is a neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA's east city area. It has zip codes of both 15221 and 15208, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by both the council members for District 9 (Northeast Neighborhoods). *Homewood South is a neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA's east city area. It has ZIP Codes of both 15208 and 15221, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 9 (Northeast Neighborhoods). *Homewood West is a neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA's east city area. It has ZIP Codes of both 15206 and 15208, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 9 (Northeast Neighborhoods). **Notable: Charles 'Teenie' Harris, photographer **Mary Cardwell Dawson, founder of the National Negro Opera Company Education Homewood is located in the Pittsburgh Public Schools district. The area offers a mix of neighborhood schools as well as specialized magnet schools. The public schools are Pittsburgh Lincoln School (K-5), Pittsburgh Faison School (K-5), and Westinghouse High School (6-12). Higher education includes the Community College of Allegheny County's Homewood Brushton Center. Employment Homewood generally has a lower income per capita than both the Pittsburgh average as well as the Pennsylvania average. This area also has a lower median household income than the Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania average. Consequently, the unemployment rate tends to be higher in Homewood than in the surrounding areas of Pittsburgh. Statistics show that of the employed population, men earn more per person on average than women. This disparity is in spite of the fact that there are more employed women in Homewood than men. Transportation Homewood is served by the Homewood station on the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway. City Steps The Homewood neighborhood has 8 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Homewood, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and provide an easy way to travel through this hilly area.

It encompasses the northern boundary of Big Lagoon as it snakes toward Pensacola Bay to the east. Wild Grande Lagoon and its minor tributaries lay within the boundaries of the park, as does the alligator- inhabited Long Pond, a man-made freshwater pond. The park includes several archaeological sites. Park development in the 1980s partially disturbed a middens from the Woodland period. This and other evidence points to historical use of this maritime habitat to forage on abundant shell fish. The park is a 'gateway site' for the Great Florida Birding Trail. It features nine distinct natural communities including estuarine tidal marsh, mesic flatwoods, wet flatwoods, and is dominated by scrubby flatwoods.

He was the Speaker of Verkhovna Rada (parliament) of Ukraine twice, first from 1994 to 1998 and then from July 2006 to September 2007. Moroz is one of the founders and leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine which was an influential political party in Ukraine. Moroz lost parliamentary representation when the Socialist Party failed to secure sufficient number of votes (2.86%) in the 2007 snap parliamentary election, falling 0.14% short of the 3% election threshold. Biography Moroz was born on 29 February 1944 in Buda, Tarashcha Raion of the Kyiv Oblast. After graduating from the local school in 1960, Moroz graduated from the Agricultural Academy of the Ukrainian SSR to become a mechanical engineer. He then worked in many careers, including as a teacher and engineer for twelve years. Moroz joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, moving from the First Secretary of local Regional Committee of the Communist Party to the position of the Head of the Kyiv Oblast Committee and the Oblast Trade Union Committee. He was a recipient of the Medal \\"For Labour Valour\\". He was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1972 to 1991. He became a deputy of Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) in 1990. During the August 1991 Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, Moroz was Communist majority leader in the Verkhovna Rada.Historic vote for independence, The Ukrainian Weekly (1 September 1991) On 26 October 1991, he arranged the congress that formed the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) as a successor of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine. Moroz ran as a presidential candidate as a nominee of the Socialist Party of Ukraine in the 1994 and 1999 presidential elections, but he came third both times, with 13.04% of the vote in 1994 and 11.29% in 1999. In 1999, many experts predicted that Moroz had a chance to defeat incumbent Leonid Kuchma in the election run-off and according to many observers the government rigged the election resultsProfile: Socialist Party of Ukraine's Oleksandr Moroz - RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY in favor of Petro Symonenko (of the Communist Party of Ukraine) in order to make sure that unpopular Symonenko, rather than Moroz, would compete against Kuchma in the run-off vote. In 1996, Moroz together with several other parties prevented President Kuchma's attempt to concentrate most of the powers in the President's hands and led the parliament to adopt on 28 June the new Constitution that includes many positions close to the demands of left-wing parties. After signing the treaty of \\"Kanev Four\\" in 1999, he became an acknowledged leader of the non-Communist opposition to Kuchma. At a 2001 sitting of the Verkhovna Rada, Moroz made public Mykola Melnychenko‚Äôs tapes that alleged the involvement of the top leaders of the state (including President Kuchma) in the murder of famous independent journalist Georgiy Gongadze that provoked the political crisis in Ukraine known as the Cassette Scandal. Moroz was a member of a special board \\"Forum of national salvation\\", a representative of a Public Committee of Protection of the Constitution \\"Ukraine without Kuchma\\" and later \\"Rise, Ukraine!\\" in charge of negotiations with representatives of the regime. In 2002, the Socialist Party (which included Yuriy Lutsenko, Josef Vinski, Mykola Rudkovski and Valentyna Semenyuk) got the fourth place in the 2002 parliamentary election. The Socialists joined the \\"oppositional four\\", a group of parties that also included Our Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko Electoral Bloc and the Communist Party of Ukraine. Olexandr Moroz (First round) - percentage of total national voteMoroz (left), with Viktor Yushchenko In the 2004 presidential election, Moroz was nominated by the Socialist Party which he has chaired since 1991. He won third place with 5.81% of the vote. As a longtime leader of anti-Kuchma forces, Moroz quickly announced his support for Viktor Yushchenko's presidential bid against Kuchma's Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, thus making Yushchenko the favourite to win in round two. That Yushchenko did not win despite this endorsement was used to argue that there was election fraud in the run-off. Moroz supported the subsequent Orange Revolution, the mass protests that eventually led to the annulment of the vote results and to a revote won by Yushchenko. The support of the Ukrainian Socialists he brought to Yushchenko's campaign was important to widen Yushchenko's appeal to voters. Similarly, the votes of Moroz's Socialist Party faction in Verkhovna Rada (parliament) were crucial for passing several important resolutions during the Orange Revolution, particularly the non- confidence vote in the Kuchma‚ÄìYanukovych government involved in election fraud scandal. After the 2006 parliamentary election, Moroz was elected the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on 6 July 2006 (238 ayes, 226 needed for election) with support of the Party of Regions, the Socialist Party and Communist factions. The Socialist Party of Ukraine received 2.86% of the national vote in the 2007 parliamentary election, falling 0.14% below the election threshold, denying them the right of representation and removing Moroz as a member of Ukraine's Parliament. The Socialist Party chose the party leader Oleksandr Moroz as their presidential candidate for the 2010 presidential election, whose first-round ballot was scheduled to be held on 17 January 2010. 268 out of 422 party congress delegates registered supported the Moroz's nomination. During the election, Moroz received 0,38% of the votes. –¶–í–ö –æ–ø—Ä–∏–ª—é–¥–Ω–∏–ª–∞ –æ—Ñ—ñ—Ü—ñ–π–Ω—ñ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏ 1-–≥–æ —Ç—É—Ä—É –≤–∏–±–æ—Ä—ñ–≤, Gazeta.ua (January 25, 2010) Public opinion polls did not rate the Socialist Party or its leader Moroz as they were undecided as to their participation in the presidential election. In 2005, Moroz received 5.8% of the national vote. An opinion polls conducted by FOM-Ukraine in April 2009 showed Moroz with less than 1% support, with most analysts not considering Moroz as a serious contender as he would not win sufficient number of votes in the first-round presidential ballot, scheduled for 17 January 2010. After leading his party for twenty years, Moroz was succeeded as party leader by Vasyl Tsushko in July 2010.Economy minister appointed Socialist Party head, Kyiv Post (July 26, 2010) However, he was again elected as party leader in August 2011.Oleksandr Moroz elected Chairman of Socialist Party of Ukraine , National Radio Company of Ukraine (August 15, 2011) In April 2012, Petro Ustenko was elected as Moroz's successor as party leader.Petro Ustenko heads Socialist Party of Ukraine, Kyiv Post (30 April 2012) Moroz tried to return to parliament in the 2012 parliamentary election, running as an independent candidate, single-member districts number 93 (first- past-the-post wins a parliament seat) located in Kyiv Oblast; but he finished third in this district with 11.94% of the votes.Single-mandate constituency ‚Ññ 93, Central Election Commission of Ukraine In the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election, Moroz is a candidate for the Socialist Party of Oleksandr Moroz. The CEC registered Tymoshenko, Lyashka and 4 other presidential candidates, Ukrayinska Pravda (January 25, 2019)  Political views  Since organized the left-leaning Socialist Party of Ukraine, his party ideology largely evolved from orthodox communism to social democracy. He himself is a left-wing social democrat of the European type who uses both Marxist and social democratic ideas. For this reason, he met strong opposition from a more rigid-wing of his party represented by the supporters of Nataliya Vitrenko. Finally, Vitrenko left the Socialist Party, proclaimed the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine and bannered Moroz as \\"opportunist\\" and \\"traitor\\", much helping Kuchma to fight the opposition of Ukraine of which Moroz' Socialist Party was part. After the last radicals headed by Ivan Chyzh left the party and formed an organization called Spravedlyvist (Justness), Moroz was able to transform his party closer to the European social democratic model. Moroz and his party supported the political reform and Ukraine's transition towards a more European parliamentary democracy which shifted the power balance in Ukraine stripping the President of some of his powers in favor of the parliament. During the Orange Revolution, his party voted for the changes to the Ukrainian Constitution, changes that made Ukraine a parliamentary and not a presidential republic. This constitution, pushed by Moroz and Petro Symonenko, went into effect in January 2006 despite Viktor Yushchenko's furious opposition. Moroz also speaks in support of the preservation of land for Ukrainian farmers and has made many promises about resolving social problems using socialist rhetoric. The program of his party begins with a statement that demands real democracy for working people.  Bibliography  Moroz is fond of poetry and chess.

Kloss (pronounced with a long o, like \\"close\\") was an undergraduate student in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (class of 1953), but never received a degree. He was responsible for a number of innovations, including, in part, the acoustic suspension loudspeaker and the high fidelity cassette deck. In 2000, Kloss was one of the first inductees into the Consumer Electronics Association's Hall of Fame. He earned an Emmy Award for his development of a projection television system, the Advent VideoBeam 1000. Career During the course of his half-century career, Kloss founded or co-founded several significant audio and video equipment manufacturing companies, most of which were located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at least during the period he was directly associated with them. After entering MIT in 1948, Kloss bought woodworking tools which he used to make enclosures for a speaker designed by an MIT professor and his student. Henry dropped out of MIT after being drafted. He was assigned to work in New Jersey, and took a night course in high fidelity taught by Edgar Villchur at New York University. Kloss was an early adopter of new technology, including the transistor, Dolby noise reduction, and chromium dioxide magnetic recording tape. =Kloss Industries= In the early 1950s, Kloss built (but did not design) the Baruch- Lang speaker in his loft in Cambridge while he was a student at MIT. This corner speaker had four 5\\" drivers (\\"and 15 holes\\"), and sold for $25 (or $30 for the Deluxe Model \\"with a handsome frame and grill cloth\\"). =Acoustic Research= Kloss co-founded Acoustic Research, Inc. (AR) with Edgar Villchur in the summer of 1954. Villchur, a former teacher of Kloss, had designed what he called the \\"acoustic suspension\\" loudspeaker, an elegant solution to the problem of bass harmonic distortion. Villchur had written and was awarded a patent for the acoustic-suspension loudspeaker system [US Patent No. 2,775,309, December 15, 1956], and had built a prototype of the design at his home in Woodstock, New York. Villchur had tried to sell the patent to both Altec Lansing and Bozak, manufacturers of large speakers at the time, but neither company was interested. Altec told Villchur, \\"if something like what you describe was possible, our engineers would have already discovered it\\". After class one afternoon in the spring of 1954, Villchur and Kloss rode from New York City to Woodstock in Villchur's 1938 Buick, to allow Kloss to hear the prototype. After this, they jointly decided to manufacture the new speaker design which became known as the \\"AR-1\\", the first commercial acoustic- suspension loudspeaker system. Villchur was 100% responsible for the design and patent of the system; Kloss was responsible for perhaps 75% of the mechanical design of the speaker cabinet and system.Lander, David, \\"A Glorious Time: AR's Edgar Villchur and Roy Allison,\\" Stereophile, January, 2005 =KLH (KLH Research and Development Corporation)= planetary-geared knob for tuning, excellent sound quality, and a minimalist design. Kloss began his custom of eponymous products by lending his last name's initial to KLH as a founder in 1957, along with Malcolm Low and J. Anton Hofmann (son of pianist J√≥zef Hofmann), who had also been investors in AR. At Cambridge-based KLH, Kloss continued to build speakers such as the classic KLH Model Five and Six, and produced one of the first small FM radios with high selectivity, the Model Eight. The KLH Nine was the world's first full range (flat from 40 Hz - 20 kHz) electrostatic loudspeaker (1960). The tweeter was mounted near the middle, with ten woofer panels occupying the remaining area. Prototypes were completed at JansZen Laboratory and put into field tests starting in 1957, and once perfected, the speakers were put into production at KLH. Though KLH was sold to the Singer Corporation in 1964, Kloss remained at the firm for a short time to assist in the development of additional speakers and electronic music products, and the firm continued to attract design and engineering talent. Kloss created the first transistorized record player, the KLH Model Eleven. In 1967, he collaborated with Ray Dolby of Dolby Laboratories to develop the lower-cost \\"B\\" version of the Dolby noise reduction system to reduce tape hiss. This resulted in the KLH Model Forty reel-to-reel tape recorder, the first appearance of Dolby technology in the consumer product market. By 1967, Kloss had left KLH; it was eventually sold to the Japanese firm Kyocera, and production was shifted overseas. By 1979, nearly all of the original design and engineering team had left the company. =Advent Corporation= An early stand-alone Advent Dolby noise reduction unit, for tape playback use only. Later models also supported recording on tape. Kloss founded Advent Corporation in 1967. Around 1968, Kloss had quit KLH to develop a low-cost projection television, but had trouble financing the leading-edge research and development that was still required. To earn some money, he decided to build a high-performance, low-cost, dual-driver speaker system, \\"The Advent Loudspeaker\\". A still lower-cost speaker of similar design, \\"The Smaller Advent Loudspeaker\\", was released later. Advent designed and produced the Advent 201, the first high-fidelity cassette tape player and recorder incorporating Dolby B noise reduction. The new tape recorder had a plain, prosaic appearance that downplayed its revolutionary design and capabilities. A later incrementally-improved model, the Advent 201A, featured new Sendust tape heads which were more resistant than standard permalloy heads to abrasion from high-performance chromium dioxide coated tapes. In 1972, the Advent VideoBeam 1000 was finally released, the first large screen projection television for home use. =Kloss Video Corporation= In 1977, Kloss founded Kloss Video Corporation (KVC) as a spin-off company. He invented the Novatron tube there, which increased the efficiency of projection TVs. Having pioneered large-screen video projection systems, Kloss found himself undercut by lower- cost models from Japan, and he eventually shut down his company. =Cambridge SoundWorks= Cambridge SoundWorks - A Satellite speaker from a FPS2000 surround set Cambridge SoundWorks was founded by Kloss and Tom DeVesto in 1988. That company was quite successful, producing dozens of different models of speakers. They also produced table radios and high quality speaker systems for computers. Kloss left Cambridge SoundWorks in 1997, and the company became a subsidiary of Creative Technology. =Tivoli Audio= Henry Kloss design: Tivoli Audio PAL Former Cambridge SoundWorks co-founder Tom DeVesto founded Tivoli Audio in 2000 to sell a new table radio which Kloss designed after a brief retirement. Tivoli made the Model One (mono) and Model Two (stereo) table radios using MOSFET technology to increase selectivity; both radios have a classic appearance similar in appearance to Kloss' KLH Model Eight radio. The high-quality tuner combined with a good speaker arrangement led some reviewers to call these modern radios \\"Bose killers\\". However, the Cambridge SoundWorks Model 88 had used some similar technology, leading to a lawsuit between Cambridge Soundworks and Tivoli Audio. Design and marketing philosophy Very early in his career, Kloss decided to concentrate on designing audiovisual equipment which combined high quality, often with leading-edge consumer technology, with moderate pricing. The external appearance of his products was strongly influenced by the minimalist Bauhaus esthetic style. In his marketing and advertising, he emphasized both the high performance and the moderate cost of his products. To keep prices low, he often sold products via mail order, with generous trial period and return policies. Personal life Kloss was sometimes seen riding an old bicycle on the streets of Cambridge, or driving an old but durable car. He usually dressed informally in well-worn clothes, and had a direct, pragmatic approach to problem-solving. Old customers would sometimes drop by his house looking for long-discontinued replacement parts, which Kloss would obligingly retrieve from the basement. His offices were cluttered with equipment and circuit boards, and he wore his gray hair pulled back out of the way in a ponytail. He died suddenly of a subdural hematoma on January 31, 2002. He was survived by a son, two daughters, and seven grandchildren. References *Stereophile obituary *Wes Phillips (2002) Henry Kloss: The Man Who Changed Audio and Video *CE Hall of Fame: Henry Kloss.

E. (2013). 11 Multiple perpetrator rape victimization. Handbook on the Study of Multiple Perpetrator Rape: A Multidisciplinary Response to an International Problem, Miranda A.H Horvath, Jessica Woodhams (Editors), 4, Chapter 11; is the rape of a single victim by two or more violators (typically at least three).Neumann, Stephani. Gang Rape: Examining Peer Support and Alcohol in Fraternities. Sex Crimes and Paraphilia. Hickey, Eric W., 397-407 Gang rapes are forged on shared identity of the same religion or race. There are multiple motives for the serial gang rapes, such as for sexual entitlement, asserting sexual prowess, war, punishment, and in up to 30% cases for targeting another race or religion. The term was coined by Bernice Sandler. It may also be referred to as party rape.  Gang rape in literature  = Hebrew Bible = The Hebrew Bible documents two narratives of gang rapes (both of which are homosexual): the infamous account of Sodom and the story of the Levite Concubine in Gibeah (presented as a doublet with mimicking literary structure to the former). Both instances result in the judgement of Yahweh through destruction and war respectively.  Characteristics of serial rape gangs  = Serial behavior = Gang rapes often involve two or more men as perpetrators. These rapes have characteristics beyond those found in rape by individuals; for example, gang rapists tend to be younger and serial in their crimes, the gang is more often under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Gang rapes are more violent; the sexual and non-sexual injuries to the victim are often far more severe. The gang members typically dehumanize their target victim(s) before and during the rape.Ullman, Sarah (1999). A comparison of gang and individual rape incidents. Violence and victims, 14(2), pp. 123‚Äì133Porter, L. E., & Alison, L. J. (2001). A Partially Ordered Scale of Influence in Violent Group Behavior An Example From Gang Rape. Small Group Research, 32(4), pp. 475‚Äì497 Everywhere there is a tendency to blame the victim; however, gang rapes are almost always premeditated in their intent, target victim(s), social proof, and psychological causes.Smith, Merril (Ed.). (2004). Encyclopedia of rape. Greenwood Publishing Group.Ellis, Lee (Ed.). (1989). Theories of Rape: Recent Inquiries Into the Causes of Sexual Aggression. Taylor & Francis. Certain events such as civil wars, hate propaganda, and ethnic conflicts increase the incidence rate of gang rapes.Thompson, Allan (Ed.) (2007), The media and the Rwanda genocide. IDRC, Barnes, A. (Ed.). (2005). The handbook of women, psychology, and the law. John Wiley & Sons Rape gang members often have a binding force such as the same religion, race or place of residence thereby forming a close-knit peer pressure group, encouraged by the behavior of their fellow criminals. A 2013 study based on 25 year crime data from US and Europe, between 10% to 20% of all rapes were gang rapes. Less than one in three gang rapes are reported, while less than 1 in 20 attempted but failed gang rapes are reported. = Group-think criminal spiral = Gang rape can be seen as an example of a group criminal spin. Accordingly, a group of individuals may perform an initial behavior that proceeds in a criminal direction far beyond the initial intention of its participants. Within this process, each group member contributes a certain role towards the development of the criminal spin‚Äîeven the passive members, who are silent participants, support the spin by their very presence. It is considered a group criminal spin because the most gang members perform this act only during a group interaction, \\"letting themselves\\" deviate from their everyday norms. On these occasions, the group interaction provides an \\"I can\\" component of a spin: Although each member does not usually sense an inner ability and permission to act in the criminal direction, i.e., to gang rape, the perceived power of the group supplies this sense and allows the act. In the same way, a group interaction may display an \\"I must\\" motive, thus social forces within the group directs it towards raping. In any case, the interaction of members of a group in a spin gives rise to self-centered norms that contribute to the further development of the criminal spin till the extreme point of an accomplishment of the rape. Group rape is often committed while committing another offense, e.g., robbery, and in line with Ben Azzai's warning in the Ethics of the Fathers that ‚Äúone sin leads to another sin‚Äù, the planned robbery also turns into an unplanned group rape. In such a process of an acute group spin, the group operates as a whole that is larger than its parts.Akers, R. L., & Jensen, G. F. (2006). The empirical status of social learning theory of crime and deviance: The past, present, and future. In F. Cullen, J. P. Wright, & K. R. Blevins (Eds.), Taking stock: The status of criminological theory. Advances in criminological theory (Vol. 15, pp. 37-76). New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction. Even if its individual members would not have committed the rape, their collective spin leads to an extreme escalation of violence. Research on members of youth gangs exhibiting chronic group spin patterns has also validated this claim, given that the extent of the offenses committed by the members had grown since they joined the gang.Battin-Pearson, S. R., Thornberry, T. P., Hawkins, D. J., & Krohn, M. D. (1998). Gang mem- bership, delinquent peers, and delinquent behavior. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs. Motives = Sexual entitlement and entertainment= A 2013 Lancet report also found that among the motives for rape were sexual entitlement and seeking of entertainment. Associated factors in the crime included alcohol misuse, poverty, personal history of childhood victimization, need to prove heterosexual performance, dominance over women, and participation in gangs and related activities. Most cases were not reported to law enforcement, and just 23% of single or multiple perpetrator rapes that were reported by the victims ended in prison sentence. The 1886 Mount Rennie rape case in Sydney in Australia falls in this category. =As an act of war= Gang rapes during civil wars and ethnic riots take added dimension of becoming a means of revenge, sending a message to the victims' community, inducing fear in the opponent, and creating a sense of solidarity among the soldiers or militants or the violent group.Olujic, M. B. (1995). Women, rape, and war: The continued trauma of refugees and displaced persons in Croatia. Anthropology of East Europe Review, 13(1), pp. 62‚Äì67Miller, Jody, & Glassner, Barry (1997).

Qualitative research, pp. 99‚Äì112, chapter 8 Major ethnic conflicts and wars within the last 50 years have witnessed a campaign of gang rapes.Card, Claudia, Rape as a Weapon of War, Hypatia 11.4 (1996), pp. 5‚Äì18 Rapes by Soviet soldiers and the Mahmudiyah rape and killings by American soldiers are examples of such war crimes. The Congo war saw thousands of gang rapes every week, with each relief center reporting 10 or more daily victims of gang rape with battering of women. The Rwandan genocide of 1994 witnessed numerous gang rapes by soldiers.Morris, M. (1996). By force of arms: Rape, war, and military culture. Duke Law Journal, 45, pp. 651‚Äì699 The Bosnian war during the 1990s saw a similar campaign of gang rapes.Stiglmayer, A. (Ed.). (1994). Mass rape: The war against women in Bosnia-Herzegovina, University of Nebraska Press In the 2000s, civil war-torn countries, for example Sudan, Afghanistan and Syria, reported high rates of gang rapes by government soldiers, security forces, insurgents, and militias.Farr, Kathryn. \\"Extreme war rape in today‚Äôs civil- war-torn states: A contextual and comparative analysis.\\" Gender Issues 26.1 (2009): pp. 1‚Äì41 Similar incidents have been recorded in Libya, and Mali. =As punishment= A 2013 Lancet report on rape and gang rape in Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka found that the crime was committed for various motives, including as a means to inflict punishment on the victim. Traditionally, the Cheyenne people of North America used gang rape as punishment for female transgressions. A similar practice existed among the Munduruku people of South America. Among the Mpumalanga of South Africa, there are instances of gang rape as punishment. In Argentina and Pakistan, gang rape has been reported to have been ordered as punishment. = Religious or racial factors= Though having the same race or religion often acts as a binding force for creating a close-knit serial rape gangs, studies reported that 30% of these shared-identity rape gangs specifically targeted people of another religion or race.Allison, Julie and Wrightsman, Lawrence (1993). Rape: The misunderstood crime. Sage, Selection of notable cases =Australia= * Ashfield gang rapes, four Pakistani brothers and a Nepali student were convicted and imprisoned for rapes committed over a six-month period in 2002. * Sydney gang rapes, a series of gang rape attacks committed by a group of up to fourteen Lebanese Australian youths in Sydney in 2000. =United Kingdom= * Medomsley Detention Centre, 1800+ victims, a prison for young male offenders in Durham, England from 1961 until the late 1980s, where more than 1,800 living former inmates have reported sexual and physical abuse by staff, some of which included being raped by a group at the home of an abusive prison guard. Many of the prison guards are believed to have belonged to a paedophile ring. * Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, organised child sexual abuse that occurred in the northern English town of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, from the late 1980s until the 2010s, 1400+ victims.Why Did British Police Ignore Pakistani Gangs Abusing 1,400 Rotherham Children?

This caused protests throughout the country since Mumbai with its very active nightlife was previously considered a safe haven for women. The city sessions court found the accused guilty and sentenced death penalty to the three repeat offenders in the Shakti Mills gang rape case, making them the first in the country to get the death sentence stipulated under the newly enacted Section 376E of the Indian Penal Code. * Delta Meghwal rape case On 29 March 2016, the corpse of Delta Meghwal, a 17-year-old Dalit girl, was found in her hostel's water tank. Following the registration of the police case the hostel warden, physical education teacher, and principal were arrested by Bikaner police and kept under judicial custody. The State eventually acceded to a CBI inquiry after the issue became politicized. * Kathua rape case On 17 January 2018, Asifa, an 8-year old minor girl, was raped and murdered in Rasana village near Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir. The incident made national news when charges were filed against eight men in April 2018. The arrests of the accused led to protests from groups, one of which was attended by two ministers from the Bharatiya Janata Party, both of whom have now resigned. The rape and murder, as well as the support the accused received, sparked widespread outrage. * Unnao rape case The Unnao rape case saw an allegation that lawmaker Kuldeep Singh Sengar had raped a 17-year old girl in 2017. In 2018, the alleged victim's father was jailed under the Arms Act and died in prison after being allegedly beaten up by Sengar's brother and several others. Also in 2018, a witness to the alleged assault, Yunus, died and was immediately buried by his family with no autopsy and no communication to police or investigators. Yunus' wife and family said Yunus had been ill and died a natural death. The uncle of the alleged victim was arrested and jailed in 2018 due to an 18-year-old gun-firing case. In 2019, a truck with blackened license plates hit the car in which the alleged victim and others were riding in. As a result, the victim's paternal and maternal aunts were killed. The alleged victim and her lawyer were critically injured. The police officers assigned to provide security for the alleged victim were not present, with the explanation that there was no space in the car in which the alleged victim was traveling in. Gang rape statistics by countries :This is an incomplete list of countries, where government or media have acknowledged the problem of gang rape. A study found that the gang rapes involved more alcohol and drug use, night attacks and severe sexual assault outcomes and less victim resistance and fewer weapons than individual rapes. Another study found that group sexual assaults were more violent and had greater resistance from the victim than individual sexual assaults and that victims of group sexual assaults were more likely to seek crisis and police services, to contemplate suicide and seek psychotherapy than those involved in individual assaults. The two groups were about the same in the amount of drug use and drinking during the assault. Porter and Alison have analyzed 739 gang rape cases from US and UK, and found over 20% of the gang rape victims died from injuries from the gang rape. Gang rape is sometimes stereotyped in media as a crime of poor, minorities, or culture; however, gang rape incidence rates are high in wealthy college campuses, among non-minorities and every culture.Sanday, P. (2007). Fraternity gang rape: Sex, brotherhood, and privilege on campus. New York University Press, =Bangladesh= A 2013 Lancet study reports 1.9% of all rural men in Bangladesh have committed multiple perpetrator rape (gang rape) of a woman who was not a partner, compared to 1.4% urban men. 35% of those who have committed gang rapes against women have also committed additional rapes where the victim was a man. The motives of rape included a combination of reasons. Two thirds of the gang rape perpetrators claimed entertainment as their motive, 30% claimed they participated in gang rape out of anger and to inflict punishment on the victim, while 11% indicated the crime followed alcohol consumption. =Brazil= Gang rape, or estupro coletivo, is prevalent in Brazil. In the state of Rio de Janeiro alone, over 6,000 rapes are reported every year (or about 37 per 100,000 people). Nationwide, the rape rate varied between 26 and 32 per 100,000 women in 2009.Joseph Murray, Crime and violence in Brazil: Systematic review of time trends, prevalence rates and risk factors, Aggressive Violent Behavior, Sep 2013; 18(5): 471‚Äì483 The arrest rates on rape complaints, was 4% in Rio.Rape in Brazil still an invisible crime, Fabiola Ortiz, Inter Press Service (June 24 2013); Quote \\"The civil police reported that in the first four months of 2013 there were 1,822 rapes committed in the state, while only 70 persons were arrested for these crimes.\\" About 19.6% of 2011 rapes were gang rapes.Pablo Lira, √çndice de viol√™ncia criminalizada (IVC), II Congresso Consad de Gest√£o P√∫blica, Gest√£o em seguran√ßa p√∫blica, Government of Brasil (2013); pp. 17‚Äì23 =Canada= Peer pressure and sexual aggression are among the cited reasons for the crime.De Keseredy & Kelly (1995), Sexual abuse in Canadian university and college dating relationships: The contribution of male peer support, Journal of Family Violence, 10(1), 41‚Äì53Horvath & Kelly (2009), Multiple perpetrator rape: Naming an offence and initial research findings, Journal of Sexual Aggression, 15(1), 83-96 Since 1983, Canada does not track rape or gang rape statistics separately, but tracks and reports Sexual Assault Tier 3 which includes both rape and gang rape. The average Sexual Assault Tier 3 victim rate in Canada was 15 per 100,000 women, and 0 per 100,000 men, according to a 2013 Statistics Canada article.Maire Sinha, Measuring violence against women: Statistical trends Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Statistics Canada, Govt of Canada (February 2013) =China= A Lancet study reports, an online survey of 980 Chinese men, 2.2% of them admitted to having committed gang rape (multiple perpetrator rape) of a non-partner woman. About 36% of the perpetrators had raped more than one woman, 50% of those who had committed gang rape had raped both partner as single perpetrator as well as non-partner during a gang rape, while 32% had gang raped a woman and raped a man. The study also found that 90% of the rapists were in the 15‚Äì29 age group at the time they perpetrated the first rape. In July 2013, the son of a Chinese general was charged with four other men to being part of a gang rape. This case raised significant public anger over seemingly privileged treatment of elite gang rape criminals. =Egypt= Over two dozen gang rapes were reported during civil protests in Egypt from January to March 2013; however, activists claim that many more gang rapes often go unreported because most women are too ashamed to go to the police or even tell their relatives. During July 2013 at Tahrir Square, mobs assaulted and gang raped at least 46 women in 4 days. A Dutch journalist was also gang-raped in Tahrir Square. A similar gang rape and gang beating was reported by an American journalist in 2011. In a separate survey, over 90% of Egyptian women claimed to have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime. =France= Between 5000 and 7000 gang rapes are reported in France every year. In banlieues organised gang-rapes are referred to as tournantes, or \\"pass-arounds\\"). One of the first people to bring public attention to the culture of gang rape was Samira Bellil, who published a book called Dans l'enfer des tournantes (\\"In Gang Rape Hell\\"). In October 2012, two girls in Fontenay-sous-Bois on the outskirts of Paris reported experiencing daily gang rapes in the high-rise tower blocks, sometimes by scores of boys. One witness described 50 boys \\"queuing\\" to rape her. 10 of the 14 defendants who were minors at the time of gang rape were acquitted, while the remaining 4 adults found guilty were given 0 to 12 months in prison. This case shocked the country. In 2014, the case of a Canadian tourist allegedly gang raped by four police officers in Paris received international attention. =Germany= =India= As with other countries, India does not collect separate data on gang rapes. Rapes are also suggested to be underreported. The gang rape of a 23-year-old student on a public bus, on 16 December 2012 has focused international attention on India‚Äôs legal system, especially laws pertaining to the protection of women. It sparked large protests across the capital of India, Delhi. Reports of gang rape of tourists in India have been reported. =Indonesia= Reported cases of gang rape include Jakarta International School gang rape of a six-year-old,Ont. teacher detained in Indonesia as gang- rape witness Toronto News, July 17, 2014 gang rape of a Malaysian student in Indonesia, 22-Year-Old Malaysian Student Gang Raped In Indonesia Malaysia, May 2014 and Aceh gang rape case where the victim was charged with adultery when she reported the crime.Indonesian woman gang-raped, faces caning for adultery May 6, 2014 A Lancet study of Jakarta and Jayapura city on New Guinea island, found gang rape prevalence rate to be 2% and 6.8% of all Indonesian men respectively who, at some point in their lifetime, have committed multiple perpetrator rape. About 52% of the perpetrators had raped more than one woman, 64% of those who had committed gang rape had raped both partner as single perpetrator as well as non-partner during a gang rape, while 12% had gang raped a woman and raped a man. The study also found that 90% of the rapists in Indonesia were in the 15‚Äì29 age group when they committed their first rape. =Iran= Many incidents of gang rapes have been reported in Iran. In several cases, the police officials have blamed the victim for not wearing hijab, and in one case arresting the victim and two activists, who were trying to bring attention to the gang rape.Iranian Women call for action on gang-rapes Amnesty International (1 August 2011)Gang rapes in Iran cause fear and religious controversy BBC News (15 June 2011) While official statistics on reported and pending gang rapes in Iran are not published by the Iranian government, public hangings for gang rapes are routinely reported in Iranian newspapers.Four convicted rapists hanged Parvand Iran News (12 October 2011)Six men hanged for gang rape August 2013 =Malaysia= A 15-year-old schoolgirl in Ketereh Kelantan, was gang raped by more than 30 men.T Leong, Malaysian teenager gang- raped by 38 men Reuters Malaysia reported about 3,000 rape cases in 2012, a rape incidence rate of about 10.7 rapes per 100,000 people. About 52% of these victims were less than 16 years old. Like other nations, Malaysia does not segregate rape and gang rape cases. =Nigeria= Nigeria reports thousands of gang rapes every year.Onyejekwe, Chineze J. (2008). Nigeria: The Dominance of Rape. Journal of International Women's Studies, 10(1), pp. 48‚Äì63Akinade, E. A., Adewuyi, T. D. O., & Sulaiman, A. (2010). Socio-legal factors that influence the perpetuation of rape in Nigeria. Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 5, pp. 1760‚Äì1764 In 2011, the ABSU gang rape, in which the gang videotaped their crime, drew widespread attention and protests inside Nigeria. The prevalence of group rape has been proposed as a significant contributor to spread of sexual diseases and AIDS.Dartnall, E., & Jewkes, R. (2012). Sexual violence against women: The scope of the problem. Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology. =Pakistan= The 2013 National Crime Data report for Pakistan suggest a current rape rate of 8.4 women per 100,000 population, of which about 10% were gang rapes.Crime report Shakeel Anjum, The News (Pakistan) In some cases, such as Mukhtar Mai gang rape in Muzaffargarh, village elder's council (jirga) in Pakistan have ordered that the girl in a family is gang-raped as a means of punishing her brother, and this punishment was then carried out in public with everyone watching.Pakistan: Girl gang- raped as local punishment IRIN, United Nations News Service (2 July 2002) In 2011, Pakistan's Supreme Court freed 5 men who committed the gang-rape because their action was on orders of the village council.Pakistan Supreme Court frees five in gang-rape case that received global attention Pamela Constable, Washington Post (April 21, 2011)Pakistan Supreme Court frees 5 accused of gang rape Alex Rodriguez, Los Angeles Times (April 22, 2011) Other gang rape cases reported in 2013 include Bahawalpur gang rape,9-year old Pakistani girl kidnapped and gang-raped RT News (January 5, 2013) Lahore gang rape,13 being grilled over gang rape The Nation, Pakistan (June 22, 2013) Peshawar gang rape,Alleged Pakistan gag-rape victim to appeal acquittals Radio Free Europe (February 1, 2013) Karachi gang rape of a polio-disabled girl,Polio-affected girl gang raped in Karachi CNBC (July 18, 2013) among others. Trans women are not immune. In 2018, a trans woman from Peshawar was kidnapped and raped by eleven men, who filmed the assault and shared it on social media. =Papua New Guinea= A Lancet study reports 14.1% of all men admitted to having committed gang rape (multiple perpetrator rape) of a non-partner woman sometime in their lifetime. 44% of these perpetrators had raped more than 1 woman over their lifetime. In Papua New Guinea, 25% of the first rape was committed at a juvenile age less than 15, while in 70% of the cases the perpetrator's age was 15‚Äì29 at the time of first crime. =Saudi Arabia= The Qatif rape case was a 2006 gang rape of a teenage girl by seven men. The justice received criticism because the victim was initially ordered to get lashed 200 times but the ruling was overturned by the monarch after a backlash. =South Africa= Gang rapes occur frequently in South Africa,South Africa, once called ‚Äòthe world‚Äôs rape capital,‚Äô is running out of rape kits Caitlin Dewey, Washington Post, March 5, 2013 and in certain parts it is called jackrolling. South Africa reported over 64,000 rapes in 2012, or about 127.5 women per 100,000 population.Crime Research and Statistics, South African Police Service (2013) With one woman raped every 4 minutes, South Africa has world's highest rape incidence rate per 100,000 women. Between 10% to 33% of all rapes are gang rapes involving three or more people. About 25% of youth near Johannesburg described gang rape as recreational and fun.Swart L et al. Rape surveillance through district surgeons‚Äô offices in Johannesburg, 1996‚Äì1998: findings, evaluation and prevention implications.South African Journal of Psychology, 2000, 30:1‚Äì10. In certain parts of South Africa where boys are often involved in gang rapes, called jackrolling, rape rates are higher. 40% of reported rape cases are on children below the age of 12. Vogelman and Lewis report 44% of rapists in South Africa have engaged in gang rape. The National Institute of Crime Rehabilitation of South Africa claims only 1 out of 20 rapes are reported in South Africa, suggesting 1,300 women are raped every day. A 2010 nationwide survey reported that about 27% of all South African men above the age of 18 have raped a woman in their lifetime one or more times, while 8.9% of all adult men have participated in a gang rape.Rachel Jewkes et al, Why, when and how men rape: understanding rape perpetration in South Africa, South African Crime Quarterly, Vol. 34, December 2010, pp. 23‚Äì31 The gang rape prevalence rate varied significantly in different provinces of South Africa; for example, in Eastern Cape, 13.9% of men had gang raped a woman who was not a partner. In February 2013, a 17-year-old girl was gang raped, mutilated and left to die in a town near Cape Town. This led to widespread protests. =Spain= Reported gang rape cases include gang rape of a British tourist in Spain where one of the rapists was a 70-year-old man,Spain: 70-Year-Old 'Leads Gang Rape' of British Tourist in Malaga International Business Times (2013) and gang rape in Huelva of a 13-year-old girl with mental disability.M√∫ltiple violaci√≥n infantil en Huelva La Razon, Spain =Sweden= In 2013, Forskning & Framsteg (FoF), a Swedish popular science magazine, published an article reporting that ‚ÄúThe evidence suggests that gang rapes in Sweden is increasing - despite the decline in violent crime in general.‚ÄùDramatisk √∂kning av antalet anm√§lda gruppv√•ldt√§kter. Forskning & Framsteg (2013-10-09). Retrieved on 2017-01-25. FoF went on to report that, ‚ÄúThe increase, which primarily occurred in the 2000s, may have to do with \\"rape with multiple perpetrators\\" from 2004, classified as \\"serious crime\\", which means that more obscure cases fall into this category.‚Äù FoF further reports that ‚ÄúNational Council's investigator, Klara Hradilova-Selin, said that \\"developments could at least partly be interpreted in terms of an actual increase.\\" Although there are a number of other important reasons why we are seeing more reports, such as, Klara Hradilova-Selin goes on to say, ‚Äúmore woman dare to go the police‚Äù and an ‚Äúincreased alcohol consumption‚Äù. Finally FoF goes on to report that in the 1990s ‚ÄúIn the gang rape of three or more perpetrators 39 percent are foreign born.‚Äù The statistics for gang rapes were not investigated by Swedish authorities after 2006. On 21 January 2017, in Uppsala, Sweden, a group of Arab Facebook users allegedly committed a live streaming crime, gang raping an unconscious woman for several hours. The crime was stopped when viewers of the Facebook live feed realized what was happening and phoned the police, who entered the apartment and interrupted the crime still in progress. In March 2018, newspaper Expressen investigated gang rape court cases from the two preceding years and found that there were 43 men having been convicted. Their average age was 21 and 13 were under the age of 18 when the crime was committed. Of the convicted, 40 out of the 43 were either immigrants (born abroad) or born in Sweden to immigrant parents. Another investigation by newspaper Aftonbladet found that of 112 men and boys convicted for gang rape since July 2012, 82 were born outside Europe. The median age of the victims was 15, while 7 out of 10 perpetrators were between 15 and 20. =United Arab Emirates= In several cases in 2013, the courts of the UAE have sentenced the gang raped woman to prison under its laws. For example, a British woman, after she reported being gang raped by three men, was charged with the crime of drinking alcohol in UAE; an Arab woman was sentenced to one year in prison for illicit sex after she complained of gang rape; an Australian woman was similarly sentenced to jail after she reported gang rape in the UAE, while a Norwegian woman was jailed for illicit sex when she reported rape by Arab men. In another case, an 18-year Arab woman withdrew her complaint of gang rape inside a car by six men when the prosecution threatened her with a long jail term for consensual sex with multiple men. According to ABC News, a French teenage boy was gang raped by three Dubai men. The authorities demanded that the tourist confess he is gay and that he asked for sex. The boy insisted he was raped and diplomatic pressure led to the arrest and conviction of the gang members. =United Kingdom= A number of gang rapes have taken place in the United Kingdom, although the UK authorities had not separately collected data on gang rapes until the 2011 Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre report on localised grooming entitled \\"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\\", but which only deals with adolescent victims. However Scotland Yard earlier in 2009, stated a concern over the rise of 'gang sex attacks' in London, detailing an increase of 71 cases in 2003/2004 to 93 cases in 2008/2009. Media reports of gang rapes in the UK are often racially charged since late 2000. This due to a particular pattern of repeated non-white perpetrated gang rapes in the metropolitan areas. The Rochdale sex trafficking gang would later epitomise the phenomenon. The Home Office report of 2013 described these cases as '[showing] a particular model... of organised, serious exploitation and abuse that involves predominantly Pakistani-heritage men grooming and abusing predominantly white British girls.' The report stresses that the Government does not believe 'localised grooming' is intrinsic of any culture, religion, and or race, despite acknowledging the phenomenon. In March 2014, Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker described \\"ground breaking work\\" to identify women and girls who can get drawn into gangs. \\"Girls associated with gangs can face sexual violence and we have provided ¬£1.2m for 13 Young People's Advocates to support those at risk,\\" he said on the launch of a report by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), a think-tank established in 2002 by Iain Duncan Smith, another Cabinet minister. Baker said the government had set up a network of more than 70 people with experience of dealing with gangs to work with 33 of the worst affected areas of the country, including 20 in London. In one case cited by the CSJ report, a schoolgirl was abducted and sexually assaulted by nine males because she criticised a gang member. The report found that girls as young as eight were being used to carry drugs while female gang members in their teens were being pressured to have sex with boys as young as 10 to initiate males into gangs. A 2014 report by the Office of the Children's Commissioner suggested that almost 2,500 children had been known to be victims of child sexual exploitation by gangs and groups. In July 2018 Home Secretary Sajid Javid ordered research into the particular characteristics of grooming gangs. However, as of March 2020 this report has not been released with the Home Office claiming it is ‚Äònot in public interest‚Äô to release the findings. =United States= The US reports about 85,000 rapes a year, or an average of 27.3 rapes per 100,000 population.http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and- analysis/statistics/crime/CTS12_Sexual_violence.xls] There is a rape in the US every 6.2 minutes. As with other countries, the US does not collect separate data on gang rapes; Vogelman and Lewis estimate 25% of all rapes in the US are gang rapes. Another source indicates 21.8% of American rapes are gang rapes.Horvath, Miranda et al. Handbook on the Study of Multiple Perpetrator Rape. Routledge 2013, p. 15. A Roger Williams University study estimates from survey of crime data that 16% of all male rapists in the US participated in a gang rape crime.Rape Myths and Facts, RW University (2012) A 15-year-old girl in Chicago was gang raped on Facebook live in 2017 while watched by over 40 people. On a separate occasion two teens, one 15 years old and one 16, were gang raped by over 11 men. Some examples of gang rapes reported in local media in 2013 include the Cleveland, Texas gang rape, Richmond gang rape, Vanderbilt University gang rape, New Orleans gang rape, St Paul gang rape, Miami gang rape/murder, Chicago gang rape, and Delaware park gang rape, among others.

Arthur Henry Mee (21 July 187527 May 1943) was an English writer, journalist and educator. He is best known for The Harmsworth Self-Educator, The Children's Encyclop√¶dia, The Children's Newspaper, and The King's England. The vast majority of the content is a description of churches and associated local worthies. The tone is looking back to the time of the Great War, even during publication of volumes in the 1940s. He produced other works, most of which had what would today be described as an overly patriotic tone, particularly when discussing the countryside or subjects from history. Early life He was born on 21 July 1875 at Stapleford near Nottingham, England, the second of the ten children of Henry Mee (b. 1852), railway fireman, and his wife, Mary (n√©e Fletcher). As a boy he earned money from reading the reports of Parliament to a local blind man. Career Mee's former home in Tulse Hill, London. The blue plaque at Tulse Hill. Mee left school at 14 to join a local newspaper, where he became an editor by age 20. He contributed many non-fiction articles to magazines and joined the staff of The Daily Mail in 1898. He was made literary editor five years later. In 1903 he began working for publisher Alfred Harmsworth's Amalgamated Press. He was appointed general editor of The Harmsworth Self- Educator (1905‚Äì1907), in collaboration with John Hammerton. In 1908 he began work on The Children's Encyclop√¶dia, which came out as a fortnightly magazine. The series was published and bound in eight volumes soon afterwards, and later expanded to ten volumes. After the success of The Children's Encyclop√¶dia, he started the first newspaper published for children, the weekly Children's Newspaper, which was published until 1965. Mee also wrote London ‚Äì Heart of the Empire and Wonder of the World, which became a very popular book. Although he made money from these works, he did not receive a fair share. He had a large house built overlooking the hills near Eynsford in Kent. Its development from design to the final building was depicted in later editions of The Children's Encyclop√¶dia. Mee had one child, but, despite his work, declared that he had no particular affinity with children. His works for them suggest that his interest was in trying to encourage the raising of a generation of patriotic and moral citizens. He came from a Baptist upbringing, and supported the temperance movement. Death and legacy He died in London aged 67. His books continued to be published after his death, most notably The King's England, a guide to the counties of England. Mee's works were successful abroad. The Children's Encyclop√¶dia was translated into Chinese and sold well in the United States under the title The Book of Knowledge. Mee exhibited a number of prejudices in his writing, notably anti-Catholic and anti- intellectual (which may best be illustrated by his treatment of Alexander of Hales in the Gloucestershire volume of the 'King's England').

Formed in 1995, they first split up in 2002 and have reunited occasionally since 2005. The band has released four studio albums, plus various EPs and singles. History =Formation (1995)= The Promise Ring were formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from the aftermath of several Midwest emo groups in February 1995: guitarists Jason Gnewikow and Matt Mangan (both formerly of None Left Standing), drummer Dan Didier and bassist Scott Beschta (both formerly of Ceilishrine). Mangan moved to Indianapolis soon after the group formed, resulting in them inviting Cap'n Jazz guitarist Davey von Bohlen as Mangan's replacement after he had moved to Milwaukee. Von Bohlen was friends with Gnewikow prior to this, but Didier and Beschta became new acquaintances to him after joining the group. The band recorded a three-track demo which included \\"Jupiter\\", \\"12 Sweaters Red\\" and \\"Mineral Point\\" that March, and played their first show shortly afterwards. In June, the group went on a 10-day tour of the East Coast; after a brief five- day rest, Bohlen went back on tour with Cap'n Jazz to support the release of their debut. After the ninth day of the tour, Cap'n Jazz broke up, and Bohlen was able to focus his time on the Promise Ring. =Early releases and 30¬∞ Everywhere (1996‚Äì1997)= The band released a 7\\" vinyl single through Foresight Records, which contained the tracks \\"Watertown Plank\\" and \\"Mineral Point\\". Foresight was owned by a friend of theirs. The band then went on tour, performing in church halls and basements across the US. Texas Is the Reason guitarist Norman Brannon acquired copies of the group's demo and 7\\" single and gave them to Jade Tree co-founder Tim Own. Shortly afterwards, the band were signed to the independent label for a three-album contract. After further touring at the start of 1996, the Falsetto Keeps Time EP was released in February, and was followed by a split single with Texas Is the Reason in May. Both releases were successful, with the band continuing to tour and work on material that would feature on their debut album. The Promise Ring's first studio album, titled 30¬∞ Everywhere, was released by Jade Tree in September 1996. Retrospectively, band members have voiced their dislike of the record; according to Bohlen, the album was recorded in only five days. The band additionally was confused about how they wanted to approach the music on the new record; Bohlen described the situation as one \\"where we had no idea what we wanted to do or how we wanted it to come out.\\" Didier later spoke of his dislike of Casey Rice's engineering on the record, as well as Bohlen's illness during the recording: \\"it was the wrong recording at the wrong time with the wrong person.\\" Despite this, the release was an underground success, earning the group attention from independent publications. The attention was drawn and aided by the inclusion of \\"A Picture Postcard\\", which had earlier appeared on the Falsetto Keeps Time and would go on to become a staple of the emo genre. The song again appeared as part of an EP titled The Horse Latitudes, which effectively reissued the band's earlier work in early 1997. Although the band had 500‚Äì600 copies of 30¬∞ Everywhere to sell over the course of several gigs, they managed to sell all the copies in one show when they reached CBGB's. The band further promoted 30¬∞ Everywhere starting with a six-week US tour with Texas Is the Reason, followed by a European tour in April and May 1997. =Nothing Feels Good (1997‚Äì1998)= Immediately following the European tour's conclusion, the band began writing new material for their second album, sometimes jamming for inspiration. The group went to Memphis, Tennessee and recorded the album, titled Nothing Feels Good, at Easley McCain Recording with producer J. Robbins of Jawbox. The group opted for a cleaner, more pop- oriented sound with the help of Robbins, which contrasted 30¬∞ Everywhere and the punk rock-like approach Bohlen used in Cap'n Jazz. The relationship between Didier and Beschta throughout the sessions progressively deteriorated. Around the release of Nothing Feels Good, Beschta was replaced by Tim Burton for the album's supporting tour. Burton was a former bandmate with Gnewikow in None Left Standing. A music video was made for the album's fourth track, \\"Why Did Ever We Meet\\"; it was directed by Darren Doane. Though the sessions were marked by turbulence, the album received excellent critical reception, and was featured on best-of album lists for the year by the likes of The New York Times and Teen People. In February 1998, the band were traveling back home from a show,Salamon 1999, p. 148 while on tour with Hum, in the midst of a snowstorm. Their van flipped over after Bohlen hit a bump on the road; Bohlen flew head-first through the windshield. Bohlen (who had head trauma), Burton (who had broken bones) and Didier, were released from hospital the following morning. Gnewikow, however, was in the intensive care unit for three further weeks due to a broken collarbone and other injuries. Following the van accident, the band decided to replace their guitarist once again, hiring Scott Schoenbeck in favor of Burton. The band took a six-week break to recover from the van accident before resuming shows with Jimmy Eat World in the East Coast of the US, and a European stint with Jets to Brazil. The band again toured with Jets to Brazil across the US in October and Japan in November. =Boys + Girls, Very Emergency and Electric Pink (1998‚Äì2001)= In October 1998, the band released the Boys + Girls EP, which contained the two tracks \\"Tell Everyone We're Dead\\" and \\"Best Looking Boys\\". These two tracks showcased the band move in a more pop-oriented direction. In March 1999, the band performed new material during a few shows, leading up to their European tour that April. Following that stint, the group began recording their next album Very Emergency, at Inner Ear Studios in Washington, D.C. J. Robbins would return as producer of the new album, but production credit was this time split between Robbins and the band. Robbins, Jenny Toomey and Smart Went Crazy member Hilary Soldati made guest appearances on the album. The recordings were mixed at Smart Studios, before they were mastered by Alan Douches at West Side Music. The sessions resulted in an album which moved much more towards power pop than emo, much like its predecessor Boys + Girls. Jade Tree released Very Emergency on September 28, 1999. Around the time of release, they went on a brief tour to promote the album on the East Coast and in Canada with Euphone. Darren Doane returned to film the music video for \\"Emergency! Emergency!\\"; the band agreed to make the video because Doane volunteered to do it for free.Jacks 1999, p. 68 It premiered on 120 Minutes in October. The band reconvened with Robbins to tour the US with his band, Burning Airlines, through October and November; they were joined by Pele and the Dismemberment Plan, among others. Further shows were added with Burning Airlines, pushing the trek into early December. The band performed in Japan in February 2000, before taking a break. They went on an American East Coast and Midwest tour the following month with Rich Creamy Paint, the Explosion and Pele. In May and June, the band were scheduled to go on a European tour with Burning Airlines, however, on the day they were due to leave to begin the shows, Bohlen was diagnosed with meningioma, a brain tumor variant. The tour was immediately cancelled and Bohlen underwent surgery on May 8. Up to this point, he had been suffering from strong headaches whenever the band performed for a year and a half. Two outtakes from the Very Emergency sessions were included on the Electric Pink EP, released in mid-May. The band took the next few months off to recuperate. They began playing shows again in September, when the band supported Bad Religion for three weeks on their US tour; however, Bohlen developed a post- operative infection during this stint that resulted in the group dropping off. They played shows in February 2001 to make up for the cancelled shows they had planned for December. =Side projects, Wood/Water and disbandment (2001‚Äì2002)= Following their final release in 2002, wood/water, which featured bassist Ryan Weber, The Promise Ring decided to move on to new projects, like Von Bohlen's and Didier's new band named Maritime. =Reunions= The band reunited for the Flower 15 Festival in late November 2005 in Chicago, at Metro Chicago. In mid-June 2009, a hidden webpage was discovered on the Anti website detailing an upcoming Promise Ring greatest hits compilation entitled, It's Not Brain Surgery: The Best Of. The page was subsequently removed and no official release information has yet surfaced about this posthumous compilation. On November 18, 2011, The Promise Ring alluded to a second reunion via their Twitter, writing: \\"Hello again...\\". Four days later, the band announced that they would be performing live on February 24, 2012 at Turner Hall in Milwaukee, which was followed by a Chicago date at the Metro on February 25. Drummer Dan Didier said that there would likely be more shows. To coincide with the reunion, The Promise Ring announced they would be releasing a rarities collection in the summer of 2012 on former (and reunited) manager Jeff Castelaz's record label, Dangerbird Records. As of October 2015, the collection has not been released. The Promise Ring performed at the 2012 Bamboozle Festival in Asbury Park, New Jersey with Foo Fighters, Blink-182, Jimmy Eat World, and others. The band played at the Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin on November 4, 2012. The performed again in 2015 on New Year's Eve at Metro Chicago, playing their second album, Nothing Feels Good, in its entirety. On August 14, 2016, The Promise Ring played the second Wrecking Ball festival in Atlanta. This event was the last to be held at The Masquerade.

It is loosely based upon Bilal's comic book La Foire aux immortels (The Carnival of Immortals). Immortal was one of the first major films (along with Casshern and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow) to be shot entirely on a \\"digital backlot\\", blending live actors with computer generated surroundings. The French video game studio Quantic Dream helped produce much of the cinematics.  Plot summary  The film takes place in New York City in late 21 century, where genetically altered humans live side by side with unaltered men and women, and where Central Park has been mysteriously encased in an \\"intrusion zone\\" where people who attempt to enter are instantly killed. A strange pyramid has appeared over the city; inside, the gods of ancient Egypt have judged Horus, one of their fellow gods, to cease his immortality. In the city below, Jill, a young woman with blue hair, is arrested. She is not completely human; her tissues appear to be no more than a few months old according to an examining physician, although her physical form is already that of an adult. She also possesses a number of secret powers, including one that enables her to procreate with gods, though she knows nothing of this. Horus is given a limited time to interact with the humans of New York and procreate. During his search for a host body, Horus encounters Nikopol, a rebel condemned to 30 years of hibernation who, due to a mechanical accident, escapes his prison one year early. Horus has been unsuccessful in attempting to take over the bodies of other humans; due to an incompatibility with the genetic alterations humans have undergone, the host bodies self-destruct while attempting to accommodate a god. Nikopol's body is acceptable as it has been frozen in prison/storage and not undergone the genetic changes causing the rejections. Horus takes partial control of Nikopol's body and starts looking for a woman he can mate with to provide him a son before his death sentence is carried out. When Horus/Nikopol discovers Jill, they become entangled in a web of murder and intrigue.

Consisting of a series of short stories, Copper has a very irregular schedule, with a long hiatus that lasted from 2009 to 2016. Kibuishi's webcomic was nominated for an Eisner Award in digital comics, and the work was compiled into a print volume in 2010. Development Copper began in April 2002. The pages of Kibuishi's webcomic make use of a large, square format, rather than using traditional comic book dimensions. Aside from the first page, all of the Copper pages are presented in color. The schedule of Copper is slow, new updates appearing once a month. Each page of Copper tells a self-contained story, though there are a few recurring characters. In May 2005 all of the 25 web strips that had been published to date were published as a series of 13\\" square archival prints by Nucleus,Kazu at Nucleus together with some other prints of Kibuishi's artwork. In July 2006, Kibuishi put the webcomic on hiatus again due to work on his graphic novel Amulet, among other projects, and it returned in September 2007. A single page was posted in mid-2009, after which Copper saw no further updates until December 2016, a period of nearly seven years.  Short stories  In each self-contained story the boy Copper and his talking dog Fred journey through a detailed but economically drawn landscape - sometimes beautiful, sometimes bleak, sometimes surreal. Fred usually has some concise and forcefully expressive comment to make on their circumstances, while Copper is generally more cheerfully optimistic. The first three strips suggest that their adventures are dreams. After that the question is usually left open. In three of the strips, Copper is haunted by a mysterious girl: a redhead who appears to be trapped inside a purple bubble that always floats just out of Copper's reach; a dark-haired girl with amber sunglasses who taunts him from a distance, and a blond girl wearing a red shirt with a P on it. Fred also suffers girl trouble when, to his horror, he falls in love with a female dog owned by another girl. The first volume of Kibuishi's comic anthology Flight (2004) contains two short Copper stories: the 18-page \\"Maiden Voyage\\", and the 4-page \\"Picnic\\". A further story, \\"Mushroom Crossing\\", appeared in Flight Explorer Volume One. All of these stories have also appeared on the website, but since they were designed for book publication they use traditional print- comic dimensions. \\"Maiden Voyage\\" sees Copper building an airplane from parts purchased at the local Plane*Mart supermarket, while Fred constantly frets that the plane might crash. In the end his fears turn out to be justified. In \\"Picnic\\" Copper and Fred take an aerial picnic in an airship, which Fred manages to sleep through. In \\"Mushroom Crossing\\" Copper and Fred cross a canyon, but Fred ends up falling into the canyon and finding himself with talking mushrooms, who let him back out of the canyon after yelling at him. Print compilation January 2010 saw the publication of Copper in book form, containing all of the existing pages as well Kibuishi's short stories for Flight and a step-by-step examination of Kibuishi's creation process. Reception Copper was named one of the best webcomics of 2004 by The Webcomics Examiner, Joe Zabel describing it as \\"one of the most impressive achievements in webcomics\\" despite its low number of pages. The webcomic was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Digital Comic 2006. Rating Copper a 9 out of 10, Jiffy Burke of Sequential Tart stated that \\"each of the full-page, full-color vignettes revealed in Copper are stand-alone wonders of imagination.\\" Burke compared its art to that of Jhonen Vasquez and Bill Watterson, and said that Copper's art is \\"consistently amazing and has unique personality\\".

Life  Tansey had an early introduction to art. These early childhood experiences had a profound effect on Tansey's painting style from the inception of his career as an artist. Many of Tansey's paintings are monochromatic and seem old-fashioned. His method involves laying down a layer of monochrome pigment on canvas that can be altered easily only before it dries. This leaves Tansey only about a six-hour window in which to complete his alterations. As such, he works in a style similar to fresco painters, painting in segments that he can finish in this short time frame. Tansey's choice of color and tone lends a specific feeling to each painting. Tansey lives in a two-story studio in downtown New York City and works there from late afternoon throughout the night almost every day. The first floor of his studio is reserved for final paintings only, while the second floor is where he creates all of the preparatory sketches and variations that inspire his completed works. He derives his inspiration from photographic reproductions and magazine clippings, and works in stages of small sketches and drawings until he is prepared for the final painting.  Education  From the time he was a young child, Tansey knew that he wanted to continue the family tradition and pursue a future in the art industry. He attended Saturday art classes at the San Francisco Art Institute in his early teen years and made a habit of regularly visiting art museums in the area. Beginning in 1969, Tansey spent three years studying at the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. There his works portrayed a deep interest in the appropriation and simulation of media which was a style that did not become popular until the 1980s. His early concern with this technique displays Tansey's deep understanding of art history and the development of art over time. After graduating, Tansey worked as an assistant at the San Jose State University Gallery. There he became well acquainted with the art that would later influence much of his work. In 1974, Tansey enrolled in the graduate program at Hunter College in New York City. He spent four years studying there, in what was possibly the top graduate art program of the era. There Tansey continued his examination of the historic art introduced to him by his parents, as well as modern painting and sculpture techniques and artists.  Work  Tansey's paintings normally depict everyday or historical occurrences, though they typically reveal certain oddities under closer scrutinization. He argues that representation has other functions rather than \\"capturing the real.\\" He argues that his work is about \\"how different realities interact with each other.\\" One of Tansey's most potent pieces from this early period is The Last Judgement (1971), which he created from oil on masonite. He was inspired by Michelangelo's fresco in the Sistine Chapel and proceeded to reproduce it in 32 rectangular sections. These were placed on display, arranged four across and eight tall. The entire study was done in shades of grey and brown. For Tansey, this project was \\"a synthesis of photographic, illustrative, and painterly qualities‚Ä¶ The meaning of the work resided in the process of re-translation- reinterpretation reproduction- rather than in its perceptual equivalence to reality.\\" In producing this piece, Tansey \\"discovered the notion of the 'unlimited brush'- any object able to carry paint could function as a brush‚Ä¶ touch was equivalent to light‚Ä¶ scraping off the paint let the white ground show through.\\" This technique becomes the basis for many of his later paintings. In this stepwise process, the overwhelming and complex fresco that Tansey saw in the Sistine Chapel was broken down into a methodological and grid-like cacophony of figures. At first glance, Tansey's distinctive paintings appear to depict straight narrative scenes but closer scrutiny reveals an undercurrent of quirks and visual puns. By thus manipulating the conventions and structures of figurative painting, he creates corollaries for literary, philosophical, and historical concepts in visual allegories about the nature and implications of perception, meaning, and interpretation in art. His work is in major collections including Modern Art Museum, Fort Worth; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Broad Art Foundation, Los Angeles; and Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D.C. Solo exhibitions include Kunsthalle Museum, Basel (1990); \\"Mark Tansey: Art and Source\\", Seattle Art Museum, Washington (1990, traveled to Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Canada, St. Louis Art Museum, Missouri, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, List Visual Art Center, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas through 1991); Fisher Landau Center for Art, Long Island City, New York (2005) and Museum Kurhaus Kleve, Germany (2005, traveled to W√ºrttembergischer Kunstverein, Stuttgart, Germany). In the 1970s, influenced by the work of Ren√© Magritte's eight methods, he began to search for ways of displaying oppositions and contradictions as the motivation for a painting. From this he decided that illustration and representation were fundamentally necessary to heal the rift between art and practice, between symbol and meaning. The implication is that he as an artist is searching for a \\"drive\\" to incorporate in his subjects, that would engage the viewer intellectually, while avoiding simple visual methods and opting for a more subtle and, consequently, more sophisticated and effective approach. Most of his paintings can readily be used as examples of that approach, where at first glance nothing is out of ordinary, but then it becomes apparent that certain elements are out of context, while remaining coherent visually, thus creating the conflict.

He is best known for accompanying Jean- Pierre Blanchard on his 1785 balloon flight across the English Channel. Biography Born in Boston, Jeffries graduated from Harvard College [Class of 1763] and obtained his medical degree at the University of Aberdeen. Dr. Jeffries played a role in the trial for the Boston Massacre as a witness for the defense. He was the surgeon for Patrick Carr, who was one of the Americans shot during that incident. Between 1771 through 1774 Jeffries was a surgeon on board a squadron of British ships in Boston Harbor and helped the wounded British soldiers on June 17, 1775 at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Jeffries is credited with being among America's first weather observers. He began taking daily weather measurements in 1774 in Boston, as well as taking weather observations in a balloon over London in 1784. National Weatherperson's Day is celebrated in his honor on 5 February, his birthday.February 5 is National Weatherperson's Day The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a collection of his papers, including a letter he dropped from the balloon during his historic flight, considered the oldest piece of airmail in existence.Jeffries Air-Mail Letter Collection. He fled to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1776 and later to England 1779, and was employed by the Crown during this time. In 1785, Jeffries and Jean-Pierre Blanchard crossed the English Channel in a balloon, becoming the first human beings to cross the Channel by air. Jeffries lived in England from 1779 to 1790. Despite being named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act, he returned to private practice in Boston, staying there until his death in 1819. His son John Jeffries II (1796‚Äì1876) [Harvard] Class of 1815] was an ophthalmic surgeon and co-founded the Massachusetts Charitable Eye and Ear Infirmary.

The CompM2 is a battery- powered, non-magnifying red dot type of reflex sight for firearms manufactured by Aimpoint AB. It was first introduced in the U.S. Armed Forces in 2000 , designated as the M68 Close Combat Optic (M68 CCO; NSN: 1240-01-411-1265). It is also known as the M68 Aimpoint and is designed to meet United States military standards. The sight is designed for use with the M16/M4 family of rifles, but can be mounted on any weapon fitted with an upper Picatinny rail. It is also NVG-compatible‚Äîthe aiming dot is still visible through night vision scopes and goggles. Overview The sight is water-tight down to 25 meters and runs on one 3-volt lithium battery type 2L76 or DL1/3N. Aiming dot brightness is adjustable for better visibility or increased battery life. The M68 is parallax-free at around 45.7 m (50 yards), meaning that the red dot will not change position based on eye position at that range.Army Field Manual FM 3-22.9, Chapter 8. www.globalsecurity.org.

A variant known as the ECOS-N (NSN: 1240-01-495-1385) is also issued as part of the U.S. SOPMOD kit. The sight is also available on the civilian market and is employed by various law enforcement organizations (especially for SWAT type situations that involve close quarters work) and by recreational shooters. By August 2011, the U.S. Army had bought 1,000,000 M68 Close Combat Optics. Some 85 percent of Army M4s are issued with the CCO, though optics can vary depending on unit. The sight allows soldiers to engage targets out to 300 meters while keeping both eyes open for situational awareness. Post combat surveys show an 85 percent acceptance rate of the CCO as an effective optic and for its value for close quarters fighting. =Dimensions= *Length: 130 mm (5.1 in) *Width: 55 mm (2.2 in) *Height: 55 mm (2.2 in) *Mounting ring width: 30 mm (1.2 in) Users *: Used by Hellenic Army SF. *: Used by PASKAL on XM8 and Heckler & Koch G36E rifles. : Used on Heckler & Koch HK416. : Mounted and used on M4 carbines in African Union mission in Somalia. *: M68 Close Combat Optic donated by United States to Ukrainian Special Forces * See also *SOPMOD References External links *U.S. Army website with entry on the M68 *Increasing Small Arms Lethality in Afghanistan: Taking Back the Infantry Half-Kilometer Describes the use of the M68 CCO Firearm sights ","title":"Aimpoint CompM2"},{"id":"1371950","text":"Transportation in Salt Lake City consists of a wide network of roads, an extensive bus system, a light rail system, and a commuter rail line. Although Salt Lake City, Utah is a traditionally car-oriented city (as are most other cities in the western United States), the rapidly growing public transit system has a high number of riders for a city of its size, and public transit is widely supported by its residents and businesses. Nearly all public transit in the city is operated by the Utah Transit Authority. In addition to operating the bus system, it also operates the TRAX light rail system, which contains three lines, the first of which runs from downtown south to Draper, the second runs from University of Utah southwest to South Jordan, and the third from the Salt Lake City International Airport east through downtown and then southwest to West Valley City. A commuter rail line, called the FrontRunner, runs north through Davis County to Ogden in central Weber County and south to Provo in central Utah County. UTA also operates a streetcar line that connects the Sugar House neighborhood with the TRAX system in South Salt Lake. The road system is also extensive, with three interstate highways, two additional state freeways, a limited-access highway, and a third state freeway under development/construction. However, the geographic constrictions of the Salt Lake Valley, as well as its rapid population growth, has led to severe congestion problems. Roads Spaghetti Bowl\\" Two major interstate highways, Interstate 15 and Interstate 80, intersect just west of downtown. I-15 comes in from the north end of the state, through Davis County, and heads straight south through the Salt Lake Valley and on through Utah County to leave the state on its southwest corner. I-80 comes in from the west side of the state, through Tooele County and passes the Salt Lake City International Airport before merging with I-15 west of downtown. The merge continues south for about before I-80 splits east again. It passes through largely residential areas through northern South Salt Lake and the Sugar House neighborhood of Salt Lake City before entering Parley's Canyon, passing through Summit County, and leaving the state on its northeast corner. Interstate 215, known as the \\"Belt Route\\", forms a 270¬∞ loop around Salt Lake City and its first-ring suburbs. It enters the Rose Park neighborhood in northwestern Salt Lake City from Davis County (where it recently split from I-15) and continues south, intersecting I-80 and State Route 201 before turning east in Taylorsville, intersecting I-15 in Murray, and turning north in Holladay. From there it parallels the Wasatch Range through the affluent residential eastern suburbs before ending at I-80 at the mouth of Parley's Canyon. This belt route largely serves as a commuter route for the suburbs. The 2002 Winter Olympics prompted an urgent acceleration of the already planned massive overhaul of I-15, from 600 North in Salt Lake City to 10600 South in Sandy. The interstate was expanded to ten lanes, including two high-occupancy vehicle (HOV/express) lanes. Portions of I-80 and I-215 were also reconstructed. Since original construction, the HOV lanes have been evolved to what the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) refers to as Express Lanes. These Express Lanes, also known as High-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes) are for use by vehicles with two or more persons (including buses), motorcycles, and clean-fuel vehicles. Other vehicles can also use the lanes if they use an Express Pass. The Express Pass allows for automatic electronic toll collection. Tolls vary by distance driven in the lanes and current traffic congestion. State Route 201, known locally as the \\"21st South Freeway\\" or the \\"201\\", is a freeway that heads westward from the southern I-80/I-15 junction, known as the \\"Spaghetti Bowl\\", along the border of Salt Lake City and West Valley City. This is a largely congested route that serves much of the west side commuter traffic. As it dips southward into Magna, it is downgraded to an expressway, although it is eventually planned to be upgraded to a freeway as traffic from Tooele County increases. It continues westward to I-80 near the Tooele County line. In addition to serving the westside of the valley SR-201 also serves as a commuter freeway for Tooele County and an alternative to I-80 when needed. Bangerter Highway (State Route 154) is an expressway that serves the quickly growing west and south sides of the valley. It begins near I-15 in Draper then heads west through Bluffdale and Riverton before heading north along the west side of the valley through South Jordan, West Jordan, West Valley City, and Salt Lake City before crossing over I-80 and ending at the Salt Lake City International Airport. Another expressway, that will eventually become a freeway, is the Mountain View Corridor (SR-85 and a section of the Legacy Highway project) which runs from Utah County along the west side of the valley until it reaches I-80. So far only the frontage road portion of the section that runs from Redwood Road (SR-68) at about 16000 South north to 5400 South (SR-73) at 6400 West has been completed. Construction on the section north to 4100 South has begun. However, these frontage roads function as a four lane divided expressway until the freeway is completed. Another major roadway through the valley is State Street, which is the portion of US-89 that shoots arrow-straight south through the valley from Downtown Salt Lake City to Draper, before connecting with I-15. Public Transit A TRAX train in downtown Salt Lake City. There are several modes of public transportation, nearly all of which are operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). =Light Rail (TRAX)= TRAX is a 50-station, light rail system (officially called, but rarely known as, \\"Transit Express\\") that serves Salt Lake County. In anticipation of the 2002 Winter Olympics, the system was approved in 1995. The first line began service on December 4, 1999 and currently links downtown with Draper, and another line to the University of Utah was completed in 2001, with an extension to the University of Utah Health Sciences Center in 2003. Extensions to West Valley City and to South Jordan were opened in 2011, an extension from downtown to the Salt Lake City International Airport opened in April 2013, and an extension from Sandy to Draper opened in August 2013. There are also eventual plans for a TRAX line to connect the Airport extension to the South Jordan extension, roughly along 5600 West (SR-172). In the far future, light rail might also be extended into southern Davis County and northern Utah County. The FrontRunner at North Temple station as it passes under the North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe TRAX station =Commuter Rail (the FrontRunner)= The FrontRunner (so named because it runs along the Wasatch Front urban corridor), is a 16-station, commuter rail line that runs from Ogden to Provo through Salt Lake City. By 2040, it is expected to extend from Brigham City in Box Elder County to Santaquin in southern Utah County, the approximate extents of the Wasatch Front. Construction on the first segment, between Salt Lake City and Pleasant View (just north of Ogden) began on August 10, 2005 and was opened north to Ogden on April 26, 2008. The FrontRunner was extended to Pleasant View station on September 29, 2008, offering morning and evening service past Ogden. Although service north of Ogden was cancelled in August 2018. The FrontRunner South extension south to Provo (in central Utah County) opened for service on December 10, 2012. UTA buses at the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub (Salt Lake Central station) =Bus= UTA also runs the bus system in the Salt Lake City area. The bus system reaches almost everywhere within Salt Lake City, and many points in the Salt Lake Valley and beyond, serving the entire length of the Wasatch Front. Other services provided by UTA include a paratransit service, which has curbside pickup for disabled riders, express buses running between Salt Lake City and its major suburbs, and winter service to the ski resorts in the Wasatch Range. Transit service (bus and light rail) is free within Downtown Salt Lake City and the adjacent area up to the State Capitol, UTA refers to this area as its Free Fare Zone. S Line trains in South Salt Lake (as viewed from Sugar House, December 2013) =Streetcar= For several years city officials have been studying the idea of building a modern streetcar line, a lower-speed and lower-capacity type of rail system than the TRAX light rail, and similar to the Portland Streetcar and Seattle's South Lake Union Streetcar, both of which have been visited and studied by Salt Lake officials in connection with this proposal. The S Line (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) began service in December 2013. The S Line connects the Central Pointe TRAX station in South Salt Lake with the Sugar House business district, running along a rail right- of-way at about 2300 South.Sugar House Trolley blog This developed from an earlier proposal for a heritage streetcar line. The estimated cost was $40 million to $50 million, but officials predicted that the line will generate much new property development in the areas through which it would run and would raise the value of existing development. The city of Salt Lake providing $2.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) and requested money from the federal government to have the line completed by 2012. Air Salt Lake City is serviced by the Salt Lake City International Airport and serves as a hub for Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection partner SkyWest Airlines. The airport offers non-stop domestic and international flights to cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Amsterdam, London, Vancouver, Calgary, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Cancun, and Paris. A regional airport, known as South Valley Regional Airport (formerly known as Salt Lake Airport 2), is located in West Jordan and serves as a general aviation and military helicopter training airport. Passenger rail & bus Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) provides service to Salt Lake City and the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub, operating its California Zephyr daily in both directions between Chicago, Illinois and Emeryville, California (in the San Francisco Bay Area). The next westbound stop is in Winnemucca and the next eastbound station is in Provo. Greyhound bus parked at the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub Greyhound Lines, provides interstate and intercity commercial bus service and operates out of the Salt Lake Intermodal Hub. Destinations for direct routes include Denver, Colorado; Portland, Oregon; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Reno, Nevada. Some of Greyhound's connections are operated in conjunction with Amtrak's Thruway Motorcoach. Taxi Three taxicab services exist in Salt Lake City: Ute Cab, City Cab, and Yellow Cab. In 2004, a controversy sprung up between entrepreneurs wishing to enter the taxi market in the city, and the mayor's office, which has maintained tight restrictions on the taxi fleet. The controversy was fueled by Yellow Cab's advocacy of Mayor Rocky Anderson's re-election campaign by displaying the mayor's campaign ads wrapped around the company's taxis, and further by the decision by the mayor's campaign not to report this as a political in-kind contribution. Anderson drove a cab for Yellow Cab while in college.

The roadway was first laid out in the mid-18th century and given its name in 1806. As originally designed, it connected Newark with the area north and west of the Pompton River in what is now Riverdale. Its south end is Broadway in Newark; its north end is the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike. As such, it was part of an alternate route between Newark and Paterson. In 1917, the road was designated as part of New Jersey State Highway 8. After the 1927 New Jersey State Highway renumbering, part of the road became Route 23, while another section became part of Route 9 (now County Route 506 or CR 506). Charlie Barnet recorded the song Pompton Turnpike, which was written by Will Osborne and Dick Rogers, about the Meadowbrook, a swing era performance venue on Pompton Avenue in Cedar Grove, NJ. It is now a Macedonian Orthodox Church. The song was covered as a jazz/blues vocal version by Louis Jordan, the \\"King of the Jukebox\\" in the 1940s. President Grover Cleveland was born in a small house in Caldwell on the turnpike, now Bloomfield Avenue, west of the Pompton Avenue intersection.

Route 23 bypasses this short stretch of the old road, and it is impossible to return to Route 23 at the north end of this short stretch. History In 1806, Israel Crane, a prominent businessman closely associated with the development of Montclair and Bloomfield, obtained a charter on February 24, 1806 from the state to build the private road, in the name of the \\"Newark and Bloomfield Turnpike Company\\". Israel Crane eventually became the sole owner of the stock, and the sole operator of this toll road known as the Newark-Pompton Turnpike, which opened with four toll gates at Newark, Montclair, Pine Brook, and Singac. Because of his exclusive control of the turnpike, he was given the title \\"King Crane.\\" The \\"Newark and Bloomfield Turnpike\\" made the markets of Newark and New York accessible to the farms in the northern and western portions of New Jersey. With this improved transportation Bloomfield and Montclair became commercial centers, with taverns, wheelwrights, blacksmiths and wagon makers. In 1870, the executors of Mr. Crane's estate sold the Turnpike to the Essex County Road Board. They widened, graded and macadamized the now public highway, and gave it the name of Bloomfield Avenue. Between 1933 & 1935, the Newark-Pompton Turnpike was built into a four-lane undivided arterial to connect with U.S. Route 46 (US 46). This was the section north of US 46 in Wayne up to what is now the exit (Overpass) by the present NJ Transit Route 23 Park/Ride Lot. A new alignment of Route 23 then continued north, removing the state highway from the rest of the Newark-Pompton Turnpike (except for a short ¬Ω mile stretch in Pompton Plains and Riverdale). The Highway continued on a new alignment north through Riverdale, Butler & Kinnelon, connecting to the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike in what was once known as Smith's Mills in West Milford. During the 1980s, Route 23 was upgraded from an outmoded arterial to a modern freeway with service roads.

Among the other earliest chartered or incorporated railroads, only the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad were chartered with passenger services in mind. Later, after mergers, the UNJ&CC; became a subsidiary part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) system in New Jersey by the later merger and acquisition of several predecessor companies in 1872; these purchases also included the PRR's main line to New York City (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor). Prior to 1872, its main lines were the Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C&A;, below), the first railroad in New Jersey and one of the first railroads in the United States. The Camden and Amboy was the first railroad to be conceived primarily as a passenger railroad and the first to employ steam locomotives to replace animal powered vehicles on rails. C&A; first purchased and operated (what is now the oldest surviving operable steam locomotive in the world today) the John Bull, imported from Great Britain in 1831. Its operations also led to the important development of the iron T-rail type rail tracks that became standard around the world. The United Company also included the Delaware and Raritan Canal, an early foe and then friend of the C&A.; The new conglomerate also included the New Jersey Rail Road and Transportation Company, the first railroad across the New Jersey Palisades. History John Bull, circa 1831 The first railroad charter in the United States was issued on February 6, 1815 to the New Jersey Railroad Company. Its proprietors included the famous inventor John Stevens. Based on turnpike charters, it allowed the company to build between New Brunswick and Trenton, and became a model for railroad charters in the future. The Robert Stevens discussed below was the son of John Stevens. In the early 19th century, travel between New York and Philadelphia, then America's two largest cities, was difficult and expensive. In 1800, a trip between the two cities, by horse, could take as long as eleven hours on a good day and as long as twenty on a bad one. Heavy goods went by boat, around Cape May, New Jersey. In 1829, eager to reduce the cost and difficulty of travel, New Jersey began investigating a cross-state canal and railroads. Railroads had already met with success in Britain and several American cities were planning lines of their own. The legislature, amid very aggressive lobbying, decided to build both a canal and a railroad. The canal and the railroad were to be built parallel to each other and controlled by separate companies chartered by the legislature. Each corporation was to give the state $100,000 worth of stock and pay a transit tax levied on cargo and each passenger carried. The corporation chartered to build the canal complicated this arrangement by deciding to also build a railroad. The legislature responded with a so-called \\"Marriage Act\\" to combine the two companies. =Camden and Amboy: 1830‚Äì1834= The Camden & Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C&A;) was chartered on February 4, 1830, on the same day as the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, after the two competing companies had come to a compromise. The C&A; and D&R; had the same goals ‚Äî to connect the Delaware River, serving Philadelphia, with the Raritan River, for access to New York City ‚Äî one by tow-path canal with some new innovations to cross the hills and the other by the untried railroad technology then emerging in Europe. Both ventures were considered risky, and both needed right-of-way grants from the legislature along the river's banks, requiring negotiations and design compromises before either could lay claim to a land rights charter. Subsequently, the D&R; was built to the west of the original C&A;, leaving the Delaware at Trenton and running roughly northeast to New Brunswick along the Raritan River valley, while (from the other direction) the original C&A; ran south from New York Harbor via South Amboy on Raritan Bay to Camden, thence across the breadth of New Jersey, connecting by ferry across the Delaware River to Philadelphia, both indirectly but much more rapidly linking New York and Philadelphia--at the time America's fastest growing city with its largest city and, perhaps more importantly, tying together many of its oldest industrial centers. Raritan Bay is located at the southern portion of Lower New York Bay between the U.S. states of New York and New Jersey, and is part of the New York Bight. Raritan Bay is shown as the highlighted area south of Lower New York Bay and north of Monmouth County. The bay is bounded on the west by South Amboy, New Jersey, where the Camden and Amboy Railroad (C&A;) had its northern terminus. The historic C&A; was the nation's first passenger railroad company. It connected New York City (harbor) to Philadelphia and Camden. 1834 stock certificate of the\\"Joint Companies\\" signed by Robert L. Stevens (The B.C. Cooper Collection) Robert L. Stevens was president of the C&A; in the 1830s and 1840s. The C&A; was organized on April 28, 1830. Surveys began on June 16. As railroads were a relatively new development in the U.S., rails and locomotives were imported from Britain. Construction began December 4, 1830, at Bordentown on the Delaware River; construction efforts were supported by horse-drawn carriages. R. Stephenson and Company built a locomotive steam engine for the Camden and Amboy that was completed in July 1831 and shipped to Philadelphia from Liverpool on the 14th of the same month. It was received by \\"Edwin A. Stephens for the Camden and South Amboy R. Road & Trans Co.\\" The locomotive engine was named John Bull in reference to its place of manufacture. As of 1986, it was the oldest operable locomotive engine. The John Bull arrived at Bordentown on September 4, 1831, and was first tested on November 12. The first section, from Stewarts Point Wharf near Bordentown north to Hightstown, was opened to the public on October 1, 1832, being operated by horse at first. Initially, service between Philadelphia and Stewarts Point Wharf was provided by steamboats, and a stagecoach trip was used between Hightstown and South Amboy. The trip cost $3 and ran in 9.5 hours, 1‚Äì2 hours faster than other routes. The remainder of the line to South Amboy (the current Hightstown Industrial Track) opened on December 17, allowing for the elimination of the stagecoach transfer, but the Delaware froze on December 27, requiring stagecoach operation south of Bordentown. Freight service began on January 24, 1833. Regular locomotive operation by the John Bull began on September 9 of that year. Within two months a derailment killed two people; this was the earliest recorded train accident involving the death of passengers. In the fall of 1833 the line was extended south to Delanco, and the full line to Camden was completed on December 19, 1834. The C&A; was profitable as soon as it started operations. In 1833 the company grossed about $500,000 but only had expenses totaling $287,000. =Jersey City‚ÄìTrenton: 1832‚Äì1839= On March 7, 1832, the New Jersey Rail Road and Transportation Company (NJRR) was chartered as a parallel line to the C&A;, beginning at Jersey City, closer to New York City, but was limited to building south to New Brunswick due to the C&A;'s influence; the C&A; would build the part from New Brunswick south to Spotswood (changed to Trenton in 1836 due to the alliance with the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad). In November 1832 the NJRR acquired control of the Newark Turnpike, which paralleled the planned alignment east of Newark, to avoid problems caused by competition. The stock of the Essex and Middlesex Turnpike, running south from Newark to New Brunswick, was bought April 6, 1833; the majority of the line was built directly along the turnpike. The alignment as originally planned crossed the Passaic River on the Centre Street Bridge, then curved south along Park Place and Broad Street directly into the turnpike. A branch would have run from the west end of the bridge south along the river and then southwest to the main line at the south end of Broad Street, but this became the main line and the original plan along Broad Street was never built. C&A; coach #3, built 1836, the second oldest passenger coach extant in the U.S. On November 24, 1833, the NJRR bought out the Proprietors of the Bridges over the Rivers Passaic and Hackensack, who had monopolies on their bridges over the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers (on the Newark Turnpike), in order to eliminate their threat. Around 1852, the NJRR acquired the Newark Plank Road and Ferry Company (incorporated 1849) to keep the Passaic and Hackensack monopoly. Regular NJRR service began September 15, 1834, between Newark and Jersey City, using a temporary track over Bergen Hill. An extension to Elizabeth opened December 21, 1835, using the turnpike from the south end of Broad Street. Service to Rahway began January 1, 1836, again along the turnpike from a point south of Elizabeth. Locomotives were only used south of Newark until January 11, though some horse power operations continued east of Newark. The line opened to east of New Brunswick July 11, with an omnibus transfer the rest of the way; the turnpike was used north of Iselin. On September 8, 1836, the NJRR acquired a majority of stock of the New Brunswick Bridge Company to avoid its local monopoly over crossings of the Raritan River. The double-deck bridge over the Raritan opened October 31, 1837, with a road beneath the railroad, taking the NJRR to New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Bridge Company was authorized to charge a toll on the lower level on May 7, 1838. The old 1795 Albany Street Bridge was removed in 1849, but was later rebuilt. thumb The Bergen Hill Cut, the last part of the Jersey City‚ÄìNew Brunswick line to be finished, opened on January 22, 1838, replacing the old temporary alignment over the hill and ending the use of horse power. On March 15, 1837, a supplement to the C&A;'s charter was passed, allowing the branch to New Brunswick connecting with the New Jersey Rail Road to branch off of the C&A; at Bordentown rather than Spotswood, to pass through Trenton for a connection with the Trenton Delaware Bridge and the Philadelphia & Trenton Railroad. Portions could be built next to the Delaware and Raritan Canal or along the New Brunswick and Trenton Turnpike. Construction on the branch began in September 1837 between Bordentown and Trenton, where it was built on the east bank of the D&R; Canal. The initial branch opened April 4, 1838. Construction on the extension to New Brunswick began June of that year, opening January 1, 1839. The branch continued northeast from Trenton on the east bank of the canal, splitting at Kingston and running cross-country to Millstone Junction, southwest of New Brunswick. That same day, the NJRR was completed from New Brunswick to Millstone Junction. Despite forming one third of the route, the NJRR only got one sixth of the earnings from the joint operation, which ran between Philadelphia and New York City in 5.5 hours. =Further connections and realignments: 1839‚Äì1867= 6th Massachusetts Militia Regiment departing Jersey City to defend Washington, 18 April, 1861 By 1839, a connection opened between the Philadelphia & Trenton Railroad and the C&A;'s Trenton Branch, including a bridge over the Delaware and Raritan (D&R;) Canal in Trenton. This allowed for through Philadelphia‚ÄìJersey City operation, but most traffic continued to run via Camden due to the distance between the P&T;'s Kensington terminal and central Philadelphia. On May 31, 1854, the C&A; decided to realign and straighten the Trenton Branch between Trenton and Deans Pond (near Monmouth Junction) due to bad soil conditions on the bank of the D&R; Canal. A plank road, later upgraded to a railroad branch, would be built to connect to Princeton, which the new alignment would bypass. A tunnel under the canal in Trenton was completed in March 1860, for the connection between the P&T; Railroad and the new alignment. Construction on the new line began October 1862; the Clinton Street Station on the new line at Trenton opened April 20, 1863, replacing the old State Street Station. The first train ran through the new tunnel on October 5, 1863, and the new line (along what is now the Northeast Corridor) opened November 23, cutting New York City‚ÄìTrenton time to 2.5 hours. The second track on the new line opened September 1864, but the old line remained for southbound freight. The Princeton Branch opened May 29, 1865, on which date passenger trains stopped running over the old line. The old line was removed between Trenton and Princeton in July; a portion in Trenton was kept to serve businesses. The Princeton‚ÄìKingston section was removed in September when freight operations began on the Princeton Branch; track north of Kingston (which was not next to the canal) was retained to serve the Rocky Hill Railroad. =Competition= Centre Street Bridge to Harrison. Closely tied to the early NJRR was the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad (P&HR;), later the main line of the Erie Railroad. The P&HR; agreed in June 1833 to build to the west side of the New Jersey Palisades at Marion Junction, where it would use the NJRR's Bergen Hill Cut the rest of the way to the Hudson River. The P&HR; opened November 29, 1833, prior to the opening of any part of the NJRR, in the meantime using a stagecoach along the Newark Turnpike to reach the river. A trackage rights agreement was made October 10, 1834, and P&HR; operation to Jersey City began October 20. The Long Dock Tunnel opened April 15, 1861, giving the P&HR; (by then part of the Erie) its own route to the Hudson River. Also involved with the NJRR was the Morris and Essex Railroad (M&E;), later the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's (DL&W;) main line. On October 21, 1836, the NJRR agreed to carry M&E; traffic between Newark and Jersey City, beginning on November 19. A new alignment meeting the NJRR in Harrison opened August 5, 1854. On October 14, 1863, the M&E; began using the Long Dock Tunnel. The Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) also used the NJRR to reach Jersey City from Elizabeth until its own line opened on August 1, 1864. The C&A; often used legislative and legal means to protect its monopoly on New York City-Philadelphia travel. The monopoly was finally broken on May 1, 1876, with the completion of the National Railway, over seven years after the legal monopoly expired. On January 19, 1831, New Jersey passed a supplement to the D&R; Canal's charter, allowing them to build a railroad alongside their canal. However, this was soon mooted by the union between the C&A; and D&R.; On February 15, 1831, the C&A; and D&R; were combined as the Joint Companies, with all important decisions made by a Joint Board, and all stock was consolidated. An act passed February 4, 1831, gave the C&A; monopoly powers for nine years against railroads built within three miles of the C&A;, in exchange for the state receiving 1000 shares of stock. The Protection Act, passed March 2, 1832, expanded this to give the Joint Companies a monopoly on New York City-Philadelphia traffic across New Jersey. On March 16, 1854, this exclusive right was extended to January 1, 1869, as long as the C&A; helped other railroads including the West Jersey Railroad and double-tracked its main line. In Summer 1835 Robert F. Stockton bought control of the Trenton Delaware Bridge and Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad to end its competition with the C&A; and the legal battle to connect at New Brunswick with the NJRR. On October 12 the C&A;/D&R; Joint Board authorized a purchase of the P&T;, and an agreement was signed November 11, by which the P&T; would send all traffic beyond Trenton to New York City via the C&A.; A pro-C&A; board was elected by the P&T; on January 12, 1836, and on June 1 the stock of all three companies was divided pro rata. On September 1, 1862, a competing line began operating via the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad and Camden and Atlantic Railroad, running steamboats between New York City and Port Monmouth at the north end of the R&DB.; This common threat caused the C&A; and NJRR to work more closely, signing an agreement October 1. The Newark and New York Railroad, later part of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, opened in July 1869, giving major competition to the NJRR from Newark east. =PRR lease= Map of the Camden & Amboy Railway and associated lines, showing the old alignment that operated north from Trenton until May 29, 1865 On February 1, 1867, the C&A; and NJRR were informally joined as the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Companies (UNJ). The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) approved a lease of the UNJ on May 15, 1871, and the UNJ approved May 19. On May 18, 1872, the C&A;, D&R; Canal and NJRR were consolidated, forming the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company. The new company was split into two divisions: the New York Division consisted of the NJRR and the C&A; Trenton Branch towards Philadelphia, while the Amboy Division was the original C&A; main line. In 1968 the PRR merged with the New York Central Railroad, to form the Penn Central. A series of events including inflation, poor management, abnormally harsh weather conditions and the withdrawal of a government- guaranteed 200-million-dollar operating loan forced the Penn Central to file for bankruptcy protection in 1970. The Penn Central operated under court supervision until 1976, when the Northeast Corridor rail line was transferred to Amtrak for use in passenger service, and the remaining lines were transferred to Conrail. Initially Conrail operated commuter rail service on its lines under contract to the New Jersey Department of Transportation. In 1979, the commuter lines were acquired by New Jersey Transit. Other branches *Burlington and Mount Holly Railroad and Transportation Company - opened in 1849, providing a branch from Burlington southeast to Mount Holly. From opening it was controlled by the C&A.; *Belvidere Delaware Railroad - also controlled by the C&A;, opened in stages from 1851 to 1855, running north from Trenton to Belvidere. The BDRR was leased to the UNJ on January 1, 1876. *Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad - opened in 1853 from the C&A; at Jamesburg east to Freehold, also under C&A; control. In January 1866 a connecting line opened between the new Trenton Branch at Monmouth Junction and the original main line at Jamesburg. That line, built under the F&J; charter, was transferred to the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company on July 29, 1874. A July 16, 1879 agreement leased the F&J; to the UNJ from June 1, 1879. *Millstone and New Brunswick Railroad - opened in 1854, running west from the south end of the NJRR at Millstone Junction to Millstone. The M&NB; was bought on April 21, 1915 at foreclosure. *Bonhampton - opened in 1860 *Perth Amboy and Woodbridge Railroad, operated by the NJRR, opened in 1864 as a branch from Rahway south to Perth Amboy. A June 26, 1889 agreement leased the PA&W; to the UNJ from January 1, 1891. *Rocky Hill Railroad and Transportation Company - opened in 1864 as a branch of the C&A; from Kingston on the old alignment north to Rocky Hill. The C&A; leased it November 22, 1869 and began operating it June 1, 1870. *Camden and Burlington County Railroad - running east from Camden to Mount Holly, opened in 1867 under C&A; operation. In 1868 the C&A; leased the Vincentown Branch of Burlington County Railroad, and soon after formally leased the C&BC.; *Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad - opened from the C&A; at Hightstown south to Pemberton in 1868, under lease and operation by the C&A.; *NJRR was authorized to acquire underwater land at Harsimus Cove on March 30, 1868. That land became a major freight terminal, served by the Harsimus Branch. *Mount Holly, Lumberton and Medford Railroad opened in 1869 under C&A; lease, running south from Mount Holly to Medford. *In April 1870 a new direct line opened across the Passaic River, bypassing the Centre Street Bridge. The old bridge remained for freight and to serve downtown. Included in the new line was a new station at Market Street, now Newark Penn Station. *Columbus, Kinkora and Springfield Railroad - leased March 11, 1871. The Mercer and Somerset Railroad was leased October 1, 1871. *In 1872 a short branch was built at Florence to serve a foundry on the Delaware River. * Millham Branch - opened in 1876, connected the old and new alignments northeast of Trenton. Current Historical marker signifying the Camden & Amboy Railroad in Cranbury Until 1999, the original C&A; alignment and the Trenton Branch from Pavonia Yard to Trenton was labeled as Conrail's Bordentown Secondary. It is presently operating as New Jersey Transit's RiverLINE, a Diesel multiple unit light rail transit line. Freight trains operate overnight under a Federal Railroad Administration waiver. The remaining portion of the Trenton Branch is part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. The original line from Bordentown heading north to Robbinsville is operated by CSX as the Robbinsville Industrial Track. The line ceased being a through route in 1967 when the PRR severed trackage between Windsor- Hightstown. Conrail abandoned the Hightstown-Cranbury segment in late 1982; additional trackage between Windsor-Robbinsville was dismantled in 2011 by Conrail Shared Assets. CSX operates the line north of Cranbury to South Amboy via Jamesburg. The Princeton Branch is still used by New Jersey Transit for passengers. The old alignment in Trenton is still used for freight; the old alignment from Rocky Hill to Monmouth Junction was abandoned in 1983 by Conrail, and the Rocky Hill Branch was obliterated by Conrail for the use of a rail trail along the D&R; Canal. However, the Florence Branch still exists. For 49 miles east from Trenton to the site of Manhattan Transfer station the line is part of the Northeast Corridor; from there east to the east side of the Palisades PATH and Conrail's Passaic and Harsimus Line occupy the right- of-way, side by side. East of the Palisades, the elevated structure to Exchange Place Terminal has been largely torn down, as has the elevated structure to Harsimus Cove (with the exception of the Harsimus Stem Embankment), but PATH follows the alignment of the former underground.

He is most associated with the first manned flight in Norway. Biography Dons was born in √òvre Eiker, Norway. He was the son of Johannes Albrecht Dons (1839-1921) and Johanne Marie Fleischer (1850-1943). He attended the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy (1901-05) and Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg (1907-08). From 1909, he served in the Royal Norwegian Navy as second in command on board Norway's first submarine HNoMS Kobben. He was a naval attache at the Norwegian Legacy in Washington, D.C.(1917-19) and held the same position at London and Paris (1927-30). Dons was the head of the Naval submarine fleet and served in the Admiral Staff (1929-35). On 1 June 1912 Dons performed the first manned flight in Norway in a monoplane named Start. The fixed-wing aircraft was designed by Etrich Taube and was made in Germany by Edmund Rumpler. A few days later, 7 June, Dons flew from Borre over Horten, crossing Oslofjord to Moss and Fredrikstad - covering a distance of 48 km in 35 minutes. In 1935 Dons published his book: Start: En norsk flyvehistorie fra 1912-13 (Oslo: Cammermeyers, 1935). Start is on display at the Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection located at Gardermoen, north of Oslo, Norway.

He taught at the Kharkov Institute of Engineering and Economics, the Kharkiv V.I. Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and the University of Kharkiv. He proposed new methods of economic planning based on the principles of new democratic centralism. His dissertation took form in \\"Plan, benefit and prisms\\" published in Pravda (1962). This became a basis for the Soviet reforms of 1965. His most notable works were \\"Structure of the balance of an industrial company\\" (1948), \\"Means to raise the profitability of the socialist companies\\" (1956), \\"Analysis of the use of resources\\" (1963), \\"Plan and benefits for the Soviet economy\\" (1965) and \\"Planning of the socialism\\" (1967). Reforms inspired by Liberman unsuccessfully attempted to revitalize the Soviet economy during the 1960s. Liberman's reform proposals were also implemented in East Germany.

The last two volumes of The Sources of Social Power, Global Empires and Revolution 1890-1945 and Globalizations 1945-2011, were published by CUP in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Mann's work has been subject of several books, including J.A. Hall and R. Schroder (eds). The Anatomy of Power: Social Theory of Michael Mann, (Cambridge UP, 2006) and R. Schroder (ed.) Global Powers: Michael Mann's Anatomy of 20th century and Beyond, (Cambridge UP, 2016). Mann was elected as a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 2015.

Universal Flowering (Mirovoi rastsvet) is the name given by Pavel Filonov to his system of analytical art. The system arose from cubo- futurist experiments and works that he undertook from 1913-1915. It is characterized by very dense, minutely facetted, and relatively flat surfaces created by working from the particular to the general, using the smallest of brushes and the sharpest of pencils. The images have both Cubism's multiple vantage points and Futurism's representation of a figure over time. A number of the paintings, while having a given orientation, are painted as though they could be oriented in a variety of ways. Filonov's philosophy was originally formalized in written form in 1915, which was revised and published as The Declaration of Universal Flowering in 1923 when Filonov was a professor at the (then) Petrograd Academy of Arts.

The tool division merged with Baker International in 1987 to form Baker Hughes, the world's third-largest oil-services company. The name \\"Summa\\", Latin for \\"highest\\", was allegedly chosen by several of Hughes' employees without consulting him first. Hughes was allegedly dissatisfied, and preferred the name \\"HRH Properties\\" - with the initials standing for both \\"Howard Robard Hughes\\" and \\"Hughes Resort Hotels\\". His suggestions were never implemented, and the company remained Summa for 18 years following Hughes' death. Properties  This new holding company contained Hughes' varied investments including: * KLAS-TV - the Las Vegas CBS affiliate, reportedly purchased because Hughes was dismayed that the station never played his favorite late night movies. * Hughes Airwest - a regional airline * Hughes Sports Network * Hughes Helicopters - a former division of Hughes Aircraft Company retained by Summa when the remainder of the aircraft business was donated to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as its endowment * Sands Hotel * Frontier Hotel and Casino * Landmark Hotel and Casino * Castaways Hotel and Casino * Desert Inn * Silver Slipper Casino * Xanadu Princess Resort * Hughes Nevada Mining * General American Oil Company History  Howard Hughes died in 1976 at the age of 70, without a valid will. Administrators were appointed, led by his cousin William Lummis. Most of Summa's operations were gradually liquidated. Summa's Nevada money-losing mining interests were sold by the end of 1976, while KLAS-TV and Hughes Sports Network were both sold in 1978. Hughes Airwest was sold to Republic Airlines for $38.5 million in October 1980, and Hughes Helicopters was sold to McDonnell Douglas for $470 million in January 1984. The hotel and casino properties were gradually sold off during the 1980s. As its original businesses were sold, Summa recast itself as a real estate developer, using the vast tracts of undeveloped land Hughes had amassed around Las Vegas as a starting point. In the early 1980's Summa Corporation supervised its holdings from leased office space in the Alexander Dawson building, owned by Girard B. Henderson of Alexander Dawson, Inc., in Las Vegas. It was perfect for security reasons, since it had two underground floors. In September 1994 Summa Corporation was renamed The Howard Hughes Corporation, both to honor Howard Hughes and to fulfill his original intentions of keeping his name on the business. Howard Hughes Corp. was acquired by the Rouse Company in 1996. Rouse was, in turn, acquired by General Growth Properties in November, 2004. The current version of The Howard Hughes Corporation was spun off in 2010 and is now a developer and operator of master-planned communities.

Plot Summary - 1931 edition Out on a leisurely shopping trip, Nancy, Bess and George encounter an odd French-Chinese perfume saleswoman, who is reluctant to sell a particular fragrance to Bess. On a return train trip to River Heights, they ponder her odd behavior and encounter the malnourished Millie (Joanne in the later versions of the book) Byrd, who is on her way to \\"the city\\" to seek employment. Millie becomes acquainted with the girls, and when Nancy accompanies her to a job interview, she uncovers a mysterious code in the office. Millie's grandmother, owner of Red Gate Farm, welcomes the trio and Millie to her farm where they plan to vacation as paid boarders, and assist with waiting on other boarders. Once on the farm, Nancy uncovers a strange group called The Black Snake Colony‚Äîa \\"nature cult\\"‚Äîwho are tenants on an outlying portion of Mrs. Byrd's farm. Accused of passing counterfeit money, Nancy shares details of the odd colony and the codes obtained in the office building with Federal agents. Nancy, Bess, George, and Millie go undercover disguised in the white robes and hoods worn by the cult members, and join them in their cave hideaway. This volume also serves to further develop the Bess and George characters, and their affectionate yet sometimes antagonistic relationship. 1961 revision For the 1961 version of the book, the plot elements did not change much. Millie's name is now Joanne. George is bitten by a snake, and one of the federal agents is the son of a boarder at Red Gate Farm. Al Sniggs, gruff right-hand man of Maurice Hale, is now named Al Snead. Artwork The original cover art and four illustrations were executed by R.H. Tandy. He updated his own frontispiece to pen and ink in 1943. In 1950, Bill Gillies introduced new art which was prominently featured in promotions and advertisements, as well as on one-half of Rudy Nappi's endpaper design, introduced in 1953. The iconic image is of Nancy spying on a cave from behind a tree. Because the story is nearly the same as the original version, the art was retained when the 1961 revision was introduced. It was never revised again, and remains in print as of 2009. Various editions have come under criticism from adult collectors, mainly because the costumes worn by the Colony members resemble KKK apparel.

These older modes of transportation were made for a relatively well-defined downtown area and strong neighborhoods at the end of several former streetcar lines, now mostly bus lines. Due to Seattle's isthmus-like geography and the concentration of jobs within the city, much of the flow of transportation in the metropolitan area is through the city proper. North-south transportation is highly dependent on the Interstate 5 corridor, which connects the Puget Sound area with southwest Washington cities and the Portland metropolitan area, as well as cities to the north such as Bellingham and Vancouver, Canada. I-5 continues as British Columbia Highway 99 at the U.S.-Canada border's Peace Arch crossing, between Blaine and Surrey. State Route 99 is also a major arterial in the western half of the city; it included the now defunct Alaskan Way Viaduct along the Seattle waterfront. The Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was opened in place of the elevated viaduct in February 2019 on account of seismic instability. Transportation to and from the east is via State Route 520's Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and Interstate 90's Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and Third Lake Washington Bridge, all over Lake Washington. Those bridges are respectively the first, second, and fifth longest floating bridges in the world. State Route 522 connects Seattle to its northeastern suburbs. Two public transportation agencies serve Seattle: King County Metro, which operates local and commuter buses within King County, and Sound Transit, which operates commuter rail, light rail, and regional express buses within the greater Puget Sound region. In recent years, as Seattle's population and employment has surged, transit has played an increasingly important role in transportation within the metro area. By 2017, nearly 50% of commuters to downtown Seattle arrived via mass transit. Unlike most North American cities, water transportation remains important. Washington State Ferries, the largest ferry system in the United States and the third largest in the world, operates a passenger-only ferry from Colman Dock in Downtown to Vashon Island, car ferries from Colman Dock to Bainbridge Island and to Bremerton, and a car ferry from West Seattle to Vashon Island to Southworth. Seattle was once home to the Kalakala, a streamlined art deco-style ferry that sailed from the 1930s to the 1960s. Seattle contains most of Boeing Field, officially named King County International Airport; but most airline passengers use Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in the city of SeaTac. Seattle is also served by three Amtrak routes from the King Street Station: the Cascades, Coast Starlight, and Empire Builder lines.  History  Horse-drawn streetcar at what is now the corner of Occidental and Yesler, 1884 Even though Seattle is old enough that railways and streetcars once dominated its transportation system, the city is now largely dominated by automobiles, but has recently started rebuilding streetcar lines and light rail routes. Seattle is also serviced by an extensive network of bus routes and two commuter rail routes connecting it to many of its suburbs. Organized land transportation in Seattle dates back at least to 1871; by that date a wagon traveled twice daily from what is now First Avenue (near Elliott Bay) to Lake Washington; the fare was 50 cents, no small sum for that era. In 1880 a two-horse carriage carried passengers and freight from roughly today's Pioneer Square to Belltown every two hours at a fare of 12.5 cents in an open coach or 15 cents in a covered coach. This was shortly followed by similar services connecting out to Lake Union and to Madison Park on Lake Washington. Water transport was important even within what are now city limits. A steamer connected South Lake Union to Latona (between today's Lower Wallingford and the University District and another steamer crossed Green Lake. The first street railway, Seattle Street Railway, came in 1884, with horse-drawn cars plying of track up today's Second Avenue to Pine Street, then up First Avenue to Battery Street. Yesler Way and Jackson Street got their cable cars (from Pioneer Square to Lake Washington) in 1888, allowing public transportation on routes over hills too steep for horses. Electric streetcars appeared in 1889, making Seattle one of the first cities in the United States to adopt this innovation.. Newell also writes that the entrepreneur of both the first horse-drawn streetcars and the first electric streetcars was Frank Osgood from Boston; his partners in the enterprise were Seattle pioneer David Denny and Judge Thomas Burke. The Great Seattle Fire did not slow this progress at all: by 1890, there were lines along the waterfront from South Seattle (today's South Park) to Lower Queen Anne and from the center of town to Capitol Hill, Madison Park, and Madrona. These were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. At the turn of the century, the streets were so bad that a boy named Joseph Bufonchio drowned in a sink-hole at the corner of Third and Jackson. As Gordon Newell noted in 1956, contemporary reports did not seem to consider this particularly unusual. At that time, there were about 25 independent transit lines in Seattle. By 1907, the Seattle Electric Company, owned by Boston-based Stone and Webster, leveraged its foothold in the electric power industry to consolidate these into one operation, known after 1912 as the Puget Sound Traction, Light and Power Company. It cost a nickel to ride. Puget Sound Traction was bought out by the city in 1919 for US$15 million. However, under the city's management the streetcars chronically ran a loss (even after a 1923 fare increase to three rides for a quarter, a fare of 8-and-a-third cents), and the quality of the system deteriorated. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma‚ÄìSeattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett‚ÄìSeattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. When the city received a US$10.2 million federal grant to pay off transit-related debts and modernize its transit system, rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening in 1940 of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcar service in Seattle in the early hours of April 12, 1941. This left an extensive network of buses (including of trolleybus lines) under an independent Municipal Transportation Commission as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region. The new transit system was jammed and profitable during the gasoline and rubber rationing of World War II, but the automobile reigned supreme after the war. Fares rose to 10 cents, the first of many increases that would lead to a present-day fare of $2.75. Streets, roads, and automobiles Interstate 5 highway passing through Seattle. A large volume of southbound traffic is visible during rush hour. Seattle set its first speed limit in the 1880s, in the days of horse-drawn vehicles. At that time, traffic in the Pioneer Square neighborhood was limited to . The city is described in a mid-20th-century civics textbook as \\"a city of islands‚Äîislands created both by water and by abrupt valleys that can be traversed only by bridges.\\" Already by 1948, 221,500 vehicles a day crossed the city's bridges across the Lake Washington Ship Canal and Duwamish River; except for the high Aurora Bridge (officially George Washington Memorial Bridge) across the Ship Canal, these were all drawbridges. This was before the construction of the Interstate Highways or State Route 520; the original Lake Washington Floating Bridge (opened 1940) provided the only road out of town to the east; construction of the Alaskan Way Viaduct, the first limited access highway through the city center, was still under way. Even with the lesser population of that time and fewer major highways, difficulty parking downtown had already become \\"practically an institution\\". The total number of vehicles parking downtown in a day would already have filled a parking lot the size of downtown had they all been there at once; naturally, many of these were there only briefly for shopping. Parking meters had been introduced in the early 1940s, and multi-level parking garages provided some relief (and would later provide more), but the impact of the automobile on the city was very apparent. The city was considering various proposals, such as the establishment of large parking lots on the periphery of downtown with shuttle buses into the center. The city was seeking (and failing to get) state permission to use the right of eminent domain to acquire property for multi-level parking lots. Later, in the mid-1960s, the historic Seattle Hotel building was torn down for just this purpose; the reaction against that sparked the preservationist movement for the revival of Pioneer Square, and made it clear that the city would not solve its problem by demolishing a ring around downtown. Over 15,000 Seattleites are members of the car sharing program Zipcar (formerly Flexcar). While not all members are frequent users, the use of these shared cars has been substantial enough to justify the purchase of over 150 cars and other light vehicles for the program, with an additional vehicle purchased approximately every ten days. Two other car-sharing services, Car2Go and ReachNow, operate within Seattle. = SR 99 Tunnel = Upper (southbound) deck of the SR 99 Tunnel The Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel, also known as the SR 99 Tunnel, is a 2-mile bored double-decker highway tunnel carrying a section of State Route 99 (SR 99) under Downtown Seattle from SoDo in the south to South Lake Union in the north. Since the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, the replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct has been the source of much political controversy demonstrating the Seattle process. Options for replacing the viaduct, which carried 110,000 vehicles per day, included either replacing it with a cut-and-cover tunnel, replacing it with another elevated highway, or eliminating it while modifying other surface streets and public transportation. The current plan emerged in 2009 when government officials agreed to a deep-bore tunnel. Construction began in July 2013 using \\"Bertha\\", at the time the world's largest-diameter tunnel boring machine. After several delays, tunnel boring was completed in April 2017, and the tunnel opened to traffic on February 4, 2019. = Freeways in the metropolitan region = There are 21 different freeways and highways the make up the Seattle freeway system. They are: Interstate 5, Interstate 405, Interstate 90, Interstate 705, US 2, SR 3, SR 16, SR 18, the Alaskan Way Viaduct/SR 99, SR 167, SR 303/Waaga Way, SR 410, SR 509, SR 512, SR 518, SR 520, SR 525, SR 526, SR 599, the Port of Seattle owned Airport Expressway, and the City of Seattle owned West Seattle Freeway. Interstate 5 is the major North-South route through the region. Interstate 5 is four or five lanes for most of its way through the metro area. The freeway connects the metro area to California, Oregon, and British Columbia. The freeway system uses ramp meters to help keep traffic moving. WSDOT uses variable message signs to let travelers know if there is an accident, to tell drivers how long their drive will be to certain areas, and for Amber Alerts. Recently, WSDOT installed variable speed signs along SR 520 and I-90 between I-5 and I-405, and along I-5 between the West Seattle Freeway and SR 520. There are also HOV lanes to move buses and carpools faster on many freeways and arterials. The HOV lanes on I-405 allow general purpose traffic to use them after 7pm (till about 5am), and the lanes on SR 167 are actually HOT lanes (carpools may use the lanes free; solo drivers can use the lanes for a variable fee). There are 225 lane miles of HOV lanes built and another 100 unbuilt. Freeway improvements are paid for by two gas taxes, 2003 Gas Tax and 2005 Gas Tax.  Interstate 5  This is Seattle's largest and widest freeway. Traffic back-ups going into Seattle from the north and south are very common during the morning and evening rush hours. thumb The freeway runs just east of Downtown Tacoma as it goes through the metro area. After going through Federal Way and the west side of Kent it passes by a major shopping mall, Southcenter in Tukwila, where it connects with the south terminus of Interstate 405. Then the freeway continues and passes by SeaTac International Airport in the inner southern suburbs of Seattle and passes very close to Boeing Field (also known as King County International Airport). As the freeway heads towards Downtown Seattle, reversible lanes, or express lanes, branch off the mainline and continue north through the city. The express lanes carry southbound traffic in the morning and northbound traffic in the afternoon. The Express Lanes merge with the main line in the Northgate area of North Seattle. After that, I-5 continues north through the cities of Shoreline, Mountlake Terrace, and Lynnwood. In Lynnwood it merges with Interstate 405 again. It continues north to the last large city in Seattle Metro area, Everett. It was built in South Tacoma between 1955 and 1957, North Tacoma to Kent between 1959 and 1961, between Kent and downtown Seattle in 1966, from downtown Seattle to Roanoke Street in 1964, from Roanoke Street to Lake City Way/SR 522 in 1960, and north of there to Everett in 1964.  Interstate 90  This freeway goes east out of Seattle, eventually terminating in Boston. The freeway was originally built in 1940 from Rainier Avenue to Issaquah. It passes through the Eastside's largest city, Bellevue, and skirts the north side of Factoria Mall in Bellevue, where it interchanges with the north-south Interstate 405. Then the freeway continues east and passes through Issaquah, Snoqualmie, and North Bend before climbing into the Cascade Mountains. The freeway originally consisted of four lanes, and crossed the Lacey V. Murrow Floating Bridge. In the early 1950s, an interchange was built at Rainier Avenue and the highway extended 1 mile closer to Seattle's city centre along \\"Corwin Place\\". In the early 1960s, traffic congestion forced the Department of Highways to institute a tidal flow system, in which three lanes, controlled by overhead signals went into Seattle in the morning, and the toward Bellevue in the afternoon. In 1968, improvements to the east of Mercer Island were made; the highway was widened to up to 6 lanes in each direction and the interchange with I-405 was upgraded from a cloverleaf to a fully directional interchange. Litigation kept the 7-mile section between Bellevue and Interstate 5 from being upgraded until the 1980s, at which time a new bridge from the Eastside to Mercer Island was built and the dangerous \\"bulge\\" was removed from the Lacey V. Murrow Floating Bridge. In 1990, the renovations/widening of the freeway were completed, including the new Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge over Lake Washington to carry westbound traffic and the HOV/reversible lanes, or express lanes, from Bellevue to Seattle, with general-purpose traffic allowed to use the reversible lanes in between Mercer Island and Seattle. The express lanes carry westbound traffic in the morning and eastbound traffic in the afternoon. Further improvements are now being made to put HOV lanes in both outer roadways to ready the center roadway for Sound Transit's Link light rail.  Interstate 405  Interstate 405 begins in Tukwila at I-5, SR 518, and Westfield Southcenter, and continues east through Renton and then turns north and runs through Bellevue, Kirkland, and Bothell, before turning northwest and crossing I-5 in Lynnwood (near Alderwood Mall), where it becomes SR 525, a freeway for its first few miles. I-405 was built in stages between 1955 and 1968, with a major upgrade north of Bellevue to Bothell in 1972. HOV lanes were added in the 1980s and 1990s, the interchange between I-405 and SR 520 was upgraded in the early 1990s, and new ramps have been added in downtown Bellevue in recent years to supplement the original interchange at NE 8th Street.  SR 520  SR 520 begins in Seattle at I-5 and continues east across Lake Washington on the Evergreen Point Bridge through Bellevue, interchanges with I-405, then turns northeast, passes the main Microsoft campus (which funded an overpass at NE 36th St and an interchange at NE 40th to supplement the existing interchange at NE 51st St), and terminates in Redmond at SR 202. The section between I-5 and Bellevue Way was opened in 1963, with the interchange at I-405 built in 1966. It was further extended to it current terminus between 1973 and 1982. The Washington State Department of Transportation is currently widening the freeway on the Eastside, modifying interchanges, and moving the HOV lanes to the inside of the roadway.  SR 167  SR 167, also known as the Valley Freeway, begins in Renton at I-405 and continues south through Kent, Auburn, where it interchanges with SR 410, Pacific, and Algona, then interchanges with SR 410, and currently terminates at SR 161. The Valley Freeway was built in stages between 1964 and 1977, with a major upgrade of its southern end in 1986. The Washington State Department of Transportation is currently planning to extend the freeway to Tacoma. SR 167 has HOV lanes between I-405 and SR 18 which also allow single-passenger vehicles to use them for a variable fee, also known as HOT lanes.  SR 99/SR 599  SR 99/SR 599, parts of which are also known as West Marginal Way, begins in Tukwila at I-5 and continues north to the First Avenue South Bridge, where it interchanges with SR 509, then continues as a surface street (East Marginal Way) for a few miles, then, adjacent to CenturyLink Field, becomes the SR 99 Tunnel. This tunnel passes under downtown Seattle and emerges in South Lake Union as Aurora Avenue, a divided expressway (partial control of access with interchanges) until Green Lake, where it becomes a surface street again. SR 599 was built in 1968, the freeway portion of SR 99 was built in 1956 as was the First Avenue South Bridge (a second structure was built next to the first in the early 1990s), and the Alaskan Way Viaduct was open in 1952, with an extension open in 1959, until its closure and demolition in 2019. North of that, Aurora Avenue was built in 1932, including the cantilever/truss George Washington Memorial Bridge.  West Seattle Freeway  The West Seattle Freeway begins in Seattle at I-5 and continues west, where it interchanges with SR 99 and terminates at a signal at Fauntleroy Way SW and 35th Avenue SW. The West Seattle Freeway was built in 1941, and the high-level bridge opened in 1984 and the roadway was widened in 2012 between I-5 and SR 99.  Other freeways  Most of the other freeways in the Seattle area are two lanes in each direction and generally travel in a north/south direction, with the exceptions of US 2, SR 410, SR 512, SR 518, SR 526, and Waaga Way. SR 16 is signed east-west but it travels mostly north-south. Mass transit Seattle public buses at a base. Buses with the green-and-yellow livery and blue-and-yellow livery are King County Metro buses; the bus with the white-and-blue livery is a Sound Transit bus. Central Link light rail trains in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel at the University Street Station Two public transportation agencies serve the city of Seattle: King County Metro Transit and Sound Transit. Snohomish County's Community Transit also runs bus routes to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington. Sound Transit is the regional transit authority, commissioned by voters in 1996 to build a system of light rail, express buses, and commuter rail within the Central Puget Sound area. The agency provides a number of regional express bus routes connecting Seattle with neighboring suburbs and cities. Its Sounder commuter rail system consists of two lines, linking Seattle with Tacoma along its Southern run and Seattle with Everett along its Northern run. Several stations in intermediate cities along the lines are also served. The light rail system, called Link Light Rail, includes the initial Central Link from downtown Seattle to Sea-Tac Airport, which began service in 2009. A extension to the University of Washington called University Link began service in 2016. Future extensions approved by voters in 2008 are planned to connect the University of Washington to Northgate, Lynnwood and other areas to the north; east across Lake Washington to Bellevue and Redmond; and south to Federal Way. The Sound Transit 3 ballot measure, passed in 2016, will further expand the system both regionally and within the city, with service to Tacoma, Everett, Issaquah, south Kirkland, and to the neighborhoods Ballard and West Seattle. ORCA readers at the Chinatown-International District station. The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel is a 1.3-mile tunnel under downtown built in 1987 to relieve bus congestion along surface streets. The tunnel was retrofitted from 2005 to 2007 to accommodate light rail, and in 2009, Link light rail trains began serving tunnel stations as part of the initial Central Link segment. All tunnel bus routes were rerouted to surface streets in 2019 to make way for the demolition of Convention Place Station, making the tunnel an exclusive subway for Link trains within the city core. Above the tunnel, 3rd Avenue through downtown serves as a major bus arterial, with access restricted to buses only during peak commuting hours. The city is currently in the process of expanding a modern streetcar network. In December 2007, the city inaugurated its South Lake Union Streetcar line between Westlake Center and stops in the South Lake Union neighborhood. In 2009, the Seattle city council approved a second line, the First Hill Streetcar, to connect First Hill to Link light rail at Capitol Hill and International District/Chinatown stations. The line began service in 2016 after two years of delays. Metro Transit also operated a historic Waterfront Streetcar line that ran along Alaskan Way, but the streetcar's maintenance barn was demolished to make room for the Olympic Sculpture Park, resulting in the subsequent closure of the line. King County Metro now operates a replacement bus line that mirrors the route. The proposed City Center Connector project would connect the South Lake Union and First Hill streetcars into a single line with a routing along 1st Avenue in Downtown Seattle. In 2009, the ORCA Card was introduced as a new way for fare payment between the seven transit agencies in the Puget Sound region. The card uses RFID technology to handle payment from either passes, vouchers, or the E-purse, a stored value debit account. ORCA's precursor, PugetPass, will be retained as one of the several passes that can be loaded automatically onto the card. The system also calculates transfers for a two-hour window for those paying with the E-purse. Seattle Center Monorail. The Seattle Center Monorail, constructed for the Century 21 Exposition, runs approximately between Seattle Center in Lower Queen Anne and Westlake Center in Downtown. Metro Transit offers a trip planner on its web site that provides information for public transit in Seattle and surrounding areas (King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties), including Sound Transit's Regional Express bus routes, Sounder commuter rail, Washington State Ferries, and the Seattle Center Monorail. Riders enter their intended origin and destination, along with optional time, date, and other information, and the trip planner displays itineraries showing the stops, departure and arrival times, and times to get from the origin to the destination. Metro Transit uploads their route schedules to Google and this has spawned a new generation of trip planners such as TransitTrips. BoltBus began offering Seattle's first curbside intercity coach service in May 2012, with Portland as its first destination. =Public transportation statistics= According to Moovit, the average amount of time Seattle-area commuters spend using public transit on a weekday is 74 minutes. 27% of public transit riders commute for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 minutes, while 22% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 12.5 km, while 34% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Bicycle There are extensive multi-use car-free regional pathways linking the city and county to the surrounding areas, including the King County Regional Trails System, which has of trails throughout the county. Many of the trails were converted from former railways, including the popular Burke-Gilman Trail. The Seattle Department of Transportation aims to develop a network of bike lanes, including lanes on streets, protected bike lanes, and trails, within the city by 2034. An urban bike sharing system, named Pronto Cycle Share, was launched in October 2014 and discontinued in March 2017. A pilot program allowing private dockless bike sharing companies to operate within the city began in July 2017, making Seattle the first major city in North America to feature such a system.  Airports  Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Kenmore Air DHC-3 Otter on Lake Union (Kenmore Air Harbor Seaplane Base) The city's primary commercial airport is Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, locally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located in the city of SeaTac, which is named for the airport. It is operated by the Port of Seattle and is served by a number of airlines connecting the region with international, national, and domestic destinations. The airport is a major hub for Delta Air Lines as well as Alaska Airlines and its regional subsidiary, Horizon Air. Paine Field in Everett also began operating flights in February 2019 following the construction of a two gate passenger terminal. It receives a limited number of daily flights from Alaska Airlines and United Airlines. Closer to downtown, Boeing Field is used for general aviation, cargo flights, and testing/delivery of Boeing airliners. In 2005, Southwest Airlines requested permission to move passenger operations from Sea‚ÄìTac to Boeing Field but were turned down by the county.

It lies between the villages of Tregaron and Llanfair Clydogau. History and description St. David's church The grade II* listed parish church of St David dates from the 12th century, on a site associated with religious worship since the 7th century. Fragments of much older buildings are incorporated into the Norman church. The church contains a modern statue of Saint David and a collection of Celtic crosses. When the Synod of Brefi was held in the village in the sixth century, it is said that the small hill upon which the church stands marks the spot where the ground was miraculously raised up under St David so that he could be heard better at this synod. In addition to the Anglican church, there is a non-conformist chapel, two pubs and one village shop. The village and the surrounding area are largely Welsh-speaking and the local economy is dominated by sheep and dairy farming. A mile (1500m) to the south-west and still within the parish is Pont Gogoyan, also a grade II* listed structure over the River Teifi. In 1977 the village was the scene of one of the world's biggest ever raids involving the drug LSD. Over 6 million tabs of the drug were seized as part of Operation Julie on 26 March of that year. The village is the home of the character in the television comedy series Little Britain.

Built in 1903 as a private residence, it has since served a number of functions, and currently serves as the Algerian Embassy to Canada. History The house was built between 1901 and 1903 by Ottawa lumber baron J.R. Booth who built it for his daughter Gertrude and her husband Andrew Fleck. It was designed by John W.H. Watts, who also designed Booth House. Gertrude Fleck lived there until her death in 1940 when it was purchased by Senator Norman Paterson who lived in it until his death in 1983. After Paterson's death, the house was bought by developers who hoped to turn it into a retirement home. These efforts fell through, however, and the house was left abandoned for a number of years. It fell victim to vandalism and water damage before being bought by local developer Robert Van Eyk in 1989 for some $1.3 million with the plan to turn it into a bed and breakfast. However, since the building was zoned only for residential purposes, the city blocked this plan. In 1992, the building was sold to Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corp. for just over a million dollars. They hoped to turn the structure into a meditation centre and headquarters of the Natural Law Party of Canada. Extensive renovations, reportedly costing almost two million dollars, were undertaken and the building was fully restored.Doors Open (Ottawa) Algerian embassy In 2002, the Maharishi Corp. sold the building for $2.95 million to Algeria.

It began as part of the oil drilling tool business founded by Howard R. Hughes, Sr., in 1913, which under his son Howard Hughes, Jr., diversified into real estate development. The real estate operations became a separate company, which was acquired by The Rouse Company, which in turn was acquired by General Growth Properties (GGP). In 2010, GGP spun off The Howard Hughes Corporation as a separate company. History =Early origins= The company dates to 1909 when Howard Hughes, Sr. received two patents for his revolutionary oil well drilling bits. In 1913, Hughes and Walter Sharp incorporated the Sharp-Hughes Tool Company. In 1915, Hughes became the sole owner and renamed the company Hughes Tool Company. Hughes Sr. died in 1924, and was succeeded by his son Howard Jr. The younger Hughes became involved in many businesses, including aviation, motion pictures, radio and television broadcasting, and real estate. In the 1950s, Hughes acquired some vacant land in and around Las Vegas; in the 1960s, he moved to Las Vegas, where he lived in (and bought) the Desert Inn Hotel and Casino, acquired other casinos and hotels, and bought up more vacant land, which was left undeveloped during his lifetime. =Formation as Summa Corporation= In 1972, Hughes Tool Company was separated from other Hughes interests and became a publicly owned company. The rest of Hughes' businesses were regrouped as Summa Corporation. The name \\"Summa\\" (Latin for \\"highest\\") was adopted by corporate managers against the wishes of Hughes himself, who wanted to use his name. (He suggested \\"HRH Properties\\", for \\"Hughes Resorts and Hotels\\" ‚Äì also his own initials, but was ignored.) =Company refocused on real estate= After Hughes died in 1976 at age 70, successors at Summa refocused the company on real estate development and casino operations, selling all non-core business holdings over the next few years. Holdings sold off were: * Hughes Nevada Mining, sold off in 1977. * KLAS Inc., holding company for the Las Vegas affiliate of CBS, sold to Landmark Communications (now Landmark Media Enterprises) in 1978. * Hughes Air Corporation, holding company for Hughes Air West; sold to Republic Airlines in 1979. * Hughes Helicopters Inc., sold to McDonnell-Douglas in 1984 and renamed McDonnell- Douglas Helicopters. This company is currently MD Helicopters a subsidiary of Lynn Tilton controlled Patriarch Partners. * Hughes Sports Network, a production company specializing in the broadcast of sporting events, sold in the mid-1980s. Summa also owned hotels and casinos, primarily in Las Vegas, which constituted the bulk of Summa's business in the 1970s. = Hotels and casinos formerly owned by Summa = * Desert Inn Hotel and Casino (demolished in 2001, replaced by Wynn Las Vegas) * Sands Hotel and Casino (demolished in 1996, replaced by The Venetian) * The Landmark Hotel and Casino (demolished in 1993 to expand parking lot of Las Vegas Convention Center) * Castaways hotel and casino (demolished in 1987, replaced by The Mirage and Treasure Island) * Silver Slipper (demolished in 1986 to expand parking lot of Frontier Hotel and Casino) * Frontier Hotel and Casino (demolished in November, 2007) * Xanadu Beach Resort & Marina, Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas * Britannia Beach Hotel Paradise Island, Bahamas - now the Coral Towers Hotel at Atlantis Paradise Island * Harold's Club, Reno, Nevada =Company renamed and sold off= In 1994, Hughes' heirs renamed Summa \\"The Howard Hughes Corporation\\". Hughes' heirs sold the company to The Rouse Company in 1996, and the company survived as a Rouse subsidiary. Rouse was acquired by General Growth Properties (GGP) in 2004. GGP filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2009. The company proposed a reorganization plan that included spinning off a new company named General Growth Opportunities, which would include those properties that had long-term development potential but little or no income. The name of the proposed spin-off was later changed to The Howard Hughes Corporation (THHC). The spin-off of THHC to GGP's shareholders was completed on November 9, 2010, when GGP exited bankruptcy. The new company held a portfolio that included GGP's master planned communities, mixed-use developments, and undeveloped land. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman was appointed chairman of the new company. Current properties The company divides its properties into three segments: master planned communities, operating assets, and strategic developments. =Master planned communities= The company has five master planned communities, with a total of approximately of land remaining to be developed or sold. * Bridgeland, Texas * Columbia, Maryland * Summerlin, Nevada * The Woodlands, Texas * The Woodlands Hills, Texas =Operating assets= This category comprises 65 revenue-generating assets, including retail, office, multi-family residential, and hotel properties, most of which are located in the company's five master planned communities.

Amateur Astronomer Edwin Holmes was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, in 1839. He later moved to London where he worked as a seller of glass. He lived at Hornsey Rise in North London from where he observed with a 12-inch aperture reflecting telescope he had manufactured himself. His targets included double stars. Holmes was a regular contributor to the British Astronomical Association and to the magazine The English Mechanic and World of Science. He became well known for his letters to the English Mechanic, often robustly criticising the opinions of other amateur astronomers, occasionally causing controversy. In particular, he argued for the use of reflecting telescopes in preference to refractors of similar cost. The Discovery of Comet 17P/Holmes Edwin Holmes discovered the periodic comet 17P/Holmes on 6 November 1892, and his discovery was confirmed within days at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. Holmes discovered the comet after it suddenly brightened, allowing him to notice it close in the sky to the great Andromeda Galaxy. The comet remained visible to the unaided eye for another three weeks until it faded away. 75 days later the comet once again brightened to naked-eye visibility. Holmes was later awarded the Donohoe Comet Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He was appointed an associate of the Astronomical Society of Wales, a form of honorary membership.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) is a stock exchange based in the city of Shanghai, China. It is one of the two stock exchanges operating independently in mainland China, the other being the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The Shanghai Stock Exchange is the world's 4th largest stock market by market capitalization at US$4.0 trillion . Unlike the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is still not entirely open to foreign investors and often affected by the decisions of the central government,China Briefing - Foreigners Now Allowed to List on Shanghai Stock Exchange - retrieved on January 21, 2009. due to capital account controls exercised by the Chinese mainland authorities.International Herald Tribune - China further loosens its capital controls - retrieved on January 21, 2009. The current exchange was re-established on November 26, 1990, and was in operation on December 19 of the same year. It is a non-profit organization directly administered by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The Shanghai Clearing House provides security for financial market participants, and efficient clearing services development purposes, but also conductive to international peers inter-agency communication and cooperation. It provides central counterparty clearing of foreign currency in the interbank market, including clearing, settlement, margin management, collateral management, information services, consulting services, and related management department under other business. History The formation of the International Settlement (foreign concession areas) in Shanghai was the result of the Treaty of Nanking of 1842 (which ended the First Opium War) and subsequent agreements between the Chinese and foreign governments were crucial to the development of foreign trade in China and of the foreign community in Shanghai. The market for securities trading in Shanghai begins in the late 1860s. The first shares list appeared in June 1866 and by then Shanghai's International Settlement had developed the conditions conducive to the emergence of a share market: several banks, a legal framework for joint-stock companies, and an interest in diversification among the established trading houses (although the trading houses themselves remained partnerships). In 1891 during the boom in mining shares, foreign businessmen founded the \\"Shanghai Sharebrokers' Association\\" headquartered in Shanghai as China's first stock exchange. In 1904 the Association applied for registration in Hong Kong under the provision of the Companies ordinance and was renamed as the \\"Shanghai Stock Exchange\\". The supply of securities came primarily from local companies. In the early days, banks dominated private shares but, by 1880, only the Hong Kong and Shanghai local banks remained. Later in 1920 and 1921, \\"Shanghai Securities & Commodities Exchange\\" and \\"Shanghai Chinese Merchant Exchange\\" started operation respectively. An amalgamation eventually took place in 1929, and the combined markets operated thereafter as the \\"Shanghai Stock Exchange\\". Shipping, insurance, and docks persisted to 1940 but were overshadowed by industrial shares after the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895, which permitted Japan, and by extension other nations which had treaties with China, to establish factories in Shanghai and other treaty ports. Rubber plantations became the staple of stock trading beginning in the second decade of the 20th century. By the 1930s, Shanghai had emerged as the financial center of the Far East, where both Chinese and foreign investors could trade stocks, debentures, government bonds, and futures. The operation of Shanghai Stock Exchange came to an abrupt halt after Japanese troops occupied the Shanghai International Settlement on December 8, 1941. In 1946, the Shanghai Stock Exchange resumed its operations before closing again 3 years later in 1949, after the Communist revolution took place. After the Cultural Revolution ended and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, China was re-opened to the outside world in 1978. During the 1980s, China‚Äôs securities market evolved in tandem with the country's economic reform and opening up and the development of socialist market economy. On 26 November 1990, the Shanghai Stock Exchange was re-established and operations began a few weeks later on 19 December.William Arthur Thomas, Western Capitalism in China: A History of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Structure The securities listed at the SSE include the three main categories of stocks, bonds, and funds. Bonds traded on SSE include treasury bonds (T-bond), corporate bonds, and convertible corporate bonds. SSE T-bond market is the most active of its kind in China. There are two types of stocks being issued in the Shanghai Stock Exchange: \\"A\\" shares and \\"B\\" shares. A shares are priced in the local renminbi yuan currency, while B shares are quoted in U.S. dollars. Initially, trading in A shares are restricted to domestic investors only while B shares are available to both domestic (since 2001) and foreign investors. However, after reforms were implemented in December 2002, foreign investors are now allowed (with limitations) to trade in A shares under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program which was officially launched in 2003. Currently, a total of 98 foreign institutional investors have been approved to buy and sell A shares under the QFII program. Quotas under the QFII program were US$30 billion and increased to US$80 billion as of April, 2012. There has been a plan to eventually merge the two types of shares in the future. The SSE is open for trading every Monday to Friday. The morning session begins with centralized competitive pricing from 09:15 to 09:25, and continues with consecutive bidding from 09:30 to 11:30. This is followed by the afternoon consecutive bidding session, which starts from 13:00 to 15:00. The market is closed on Saturday and Sunday and other holidays announced by the SSE.Market Hours, Shanghai Stock Exchange via Wikinvest Indices The SSE Composite (also known as Shanghai Composite) Index is the most commonly used indicator to reflect SSE's market performance. Constituents for the SSE Composite Index are all listed stocks (A shares and B shares) at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The Base Day for the SSE Composite Index is December 19, 1990. The Base Period is the total market capitalization of all stocks of that day. The Base Value is 100. The index was launched on July 15, 1991. At the end of 2006, the index reaches 2,675.47.

To put it algebraically, for a positive integer n, there is a multiset of n integers {a1, ..., an}, for which the equalities n = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i hold. Negative numbers are allowed in the multiset. For example, 5 is amenable since 5 = 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 5. All and only those numbers congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4), except 4, are amenable. The first few amenable numbers are: 1, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13 ... A solution for integers of the form n = 4k + 1 could be given by a set of 2k (+1)s and 2k (-1)s and n itself. (This generalizes the example of 5 given above.) Although not obvious from the definition, the set of amenable numbers is closed under multiplication (the product of two amenable numbers is an amenable number). All composite numbers would be amenable if the multiset was allowed to be of any length, because, even if other solutions are available, one can always obtain a solution by taking the prime factorization (expressed with repeated factors rather than exponents) and add as many 1s as necessary to add up to n. The product of this set of integers will yield n no matter how many 1s there are in the set. Furthermore, still under this assumption, any integer n would be amenable. Consider the inelegant solution for n of }. In the sum, the positive ones are cancelled out by the negative ones, leaving n, while in the product, the two negative ones cancel out the effect of their signs. Amenable numbers should not be confused with amicable numbers, which are pairs of integers whose divisors add up to each other.

He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1966 to 1981, and held a number of high- profile cabinet portfolios in the government of Edward Schreyer. Miller was raised in a Jewish family in north-end Winnipeg. He was educated at the Peretz School, St. John's High School and the University of Manitoba. He spent time in the armed services and worked for a number of years at a collection agency in eastern Canada. He returned to Winnipeg in the 1940s, and worked at The People's Bookstore, the north end bookstore owned by his family. In the early 1950s, Miller started a small business called Acme Metal Products. He was also involved in B'nai Brith and the Royal Canadian Legion. Miller served as a trustee on the Seven Oaks School Board from 1953 to 1958, as an alderman on the West Kildonan city council from 1959 to 1964, and as Mayor of West Kildonan from 1964 to 1966. He was first elected to the provincial legislature in the 1966 election, winning an easy victory in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Seven Oaks. Miller had long been a personal friend of fellow MLA Saul Cherniack, and soon established himself as one of Cherniack's closest political allies. In 1968-69, Cherniack and Miller played a significant role in convincing federal Member of Parliament Edward Schreyer to replace Russell Paulley as leader of the provincial NDP. Both would later become among Schreyer's most trusted confidants. Miller was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1969, in which the NDP under Schreyer formed government for the first time. On July 15, 1969, he was named Minister of Youth and Education. As the former mayor of a suburban community, Miller was one of the few prominent New Democrats in Manitoba to oppose the party's call for a united City of Winnipeg at their 1968 policy convention. He later acquiesced to the plan, and assisted Cherniack in public consultations on the subject throughout 1970. After a cabinet shuffle on September 9, 1971, Miller was named Minister of Colleges and University Affairs. In the same year, he opposed a controversial government initiative to provide provincial funding to denominational schools. This measure was opposed by many on both the government side and the opposition. When the legislation was defeated in a free vote, Miller and Schreyer made arrangements for specific denominational schools to receive provincial money by working in conjunction with the public system. Miller was re-elected in the provincial election of 1973, although by a narrower margin than previously; local opposition to amalgamation was undoubtedly a factor. On August 29, 1973, he was named Minister of Urban Affairs. Miller served as Minister of Health and Social Development from January 28 to December 23, 1974, but was transferred back to Urban Affairs thereafter. He also served as Minister responsible for the Manitoba Housing and Renewal Corporation from January 28, 1974 to September 22, 1976. While retaining the Urban Affairs portfolio, Miller was also promoted to the Ministry of Finance on September 22, 1976. In this capacity, he passed legislation allowing for the province to introduce its own treasury banks. This policy was never enacted, however, due in part to Miller's concerns that it would label the NDP government as radically socialist. Miller helped launch pharmacare and student aid, but often said that his greatest satisfaction was ‚Äúbeing in the first NDP cabinet in Manitoba.‚Äù In 1977, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. The NDP were defeated in the provincial election of 1977, and Miller was personally re-elected over Progressive Conservative candidate Carl Zawatsky by only 820 votes. In 1979, he was one of only three MLAs to support Saul Cherniack for interim party leader after Schreyer's resignation. He did not play a major role in the legislature after this time, and did not seek re-election in 1981. Following his political career, he served as Chairman of the Manitoba Telephone System (1981-1985). Miller died of cancer at Winnipeg on 1 September 1993. He is commemorated by Saul Miller Drive in Winnipeg. There are papers at the Archives of Manitoba.

The element was introduced in Netscape Navigator but is no longer supported and often ignored by modern Web browsers; some, such as Internet Explorer, never supported the element at all. Despite its initial popularity among home users in the 1990s, it fell out of favor due to its overuse and the difficulty it presents in reading. Lou Montulli, often credited as the inventor of the blink element, claims he only suggested the idea, without writing any actual code.  Usage  The blink element is non-standard, and as such there is no authoritative specification of its syntax or semantics. While Bert Bos of the World Wide Web Consortium has produced a Document Type Definition that includes syntax for the blink element (defining it as a phrase element on a par with elements for emphasis and citations), the comments in the DTD explain that it is intended as a joke. Syntax of the blink element type is identical to such standard HTML inline elements as span. For example: . The rate of blinking is browser-specific, and the tag contains no parameters or means to adjust the rate of blinking. In versions of Mozilla Firefox that support the tag, the text alternates between being visible for three quarters of a second and being invisible for one quarter of a second. The blink element type was first invented for Netscape Navigator and was supported in its descendants, such as Mozilla Firefox (except for the Netscape 6 and early Mozilla suite browsers); it was removed in version 23.  HTML  MDN Microsoft's Internet Explorer and WebKit (the browser engine behind Apple's Safari and Google Chrome) never supported it, even in its CSS incarnation. It was also supported by the Opera Internet Browser, but support ended in version 15 when that browser switched to a WebKit-based engine. Vivaldi, despite its roots as a spiritual successor to the Presto-based Opera, also does not support a functional blink tag. Some software supports the blink element as an easter egg. Google Search blinks parts of the page when one searches for \\"blink html\\". Android's user interface framework supports the blink tag, labeling it as \`TAG_1995\` in its source code.  Implementation  The blink value of the CSS text-decoration property allows authors to suggest that text should blink without using proprietary tags, but the CSS 2.1 Specification states that \\"conforming user agents may simply not blink the text\\" in order to comply with the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines. Text to blink here The blink element may also effectively be re-implemented using CSS animations. blink, .blink { -webkit-animation: blink 1s step-end infinite; -moz-animation: blink 1s step- end infinite; -o-animation: blink 1s step-end infinite; animation: blink 1s step-end infinite; } @-webkit-keyframes blink { 67% { opacity: 0 } } @-moz- keyframes blink { 67% { opacity: 0 } } @-o-keyframes blink { 67% { opacity: 0 } } @keyframes blink { 67% { opacity: 0 } } Similar effects can also be achieved through the use of JavaScript. Text to blink here Or alternatively, the blink functionality can be implemented with the help of jQuery. Text to blink here  Usability and accessibility  A 1982 Apple Computer manual for developers advised against using blinking text, warning that \\"flashing [text] should only be used to indicate imminent destruction of data or the program\\". The blink element has been consistently criticised by usability and accessibility experts. In 1996 Jakob Nielsen described the element as \\"simply evil\\" in his Alertbox column Top Ten Mistakes in Web Design. The World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 state that content authors should avoid causing the screen to flicker or blink, noting that such effects can cause problems for people with cognitive disabilities or photosensitive epilepsy. The United States Federal Government's Section 508 states that pages should avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency between 2 Hz and 55 Hz, a range that covers rapidly blinking text. The German Federal Government's Barrierefreie Informationstechnik-Verordnung (Accessible Information Technology Ordinance) also states that flickering or blinking content should be avoided. To comply with the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines a user agent must either \\"allow configuration to render animated or blinking text content as motionless, unblinking text\\" or never blink text. Mozilla Firefox satisfied this requirement by providing a hidden configuration option to disable blinking, browser.blink_allowed, which could be accessed through about:config. The blinking feature has been disabled altogether since version 23.

The birthdate is calculated from a 1562 woodcut of Day that proclaims his age to be 40 (\\"Life is death and death is life: √¶tatis su√¶ XXXX\\"). ‚Äì 23 July 1584) was an English Protestant printer. He specialised in printing and distributing Protestant literature and pamphlets, and produced many small-format religious books, such as ABCs, sermons, and translations of psalms. He found fame, however, as the publisher of John Foxe's Actes and Monuments, also known as the Book of Martyrs, the largest and most technologically accomplished book printed in sixteenth-century England.King, Book of Martyrs, 81. Day rose to the top of his profession during the reign of Edward VI (1547‚Äì1553). At this time, restrictions on publishers were relaxed, and a wave of propaganda on behalf of the English Reformation was encouraged by the government of the Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. During the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary I, many Protestant printers fled to the continent, but Day stayed in England and continued to print Protestant literature. In 1554, he was arrested and imprisoned, presumably for these illicit printing activities.King, Book of Martyrs, 82. Under Queen Elizabeth I, Day returned to his premises at Aldersgate in London, where he enjoyed the patronage of high-ranking officials and nobles, including William Cecil, Robert Dudley, and Matthew Parker. With their support, he published the Book of Martyrs and was awarded monopolies for some of the most popular English books, such as The ABC with Little Catechism and The Whole Booke of Psalmes.King, Book of Martyrs, 83. Day, whose technical skill matched his business acumen, has been called \\"the master printer of the English Reformation\\".King, Book of Martyrs, 80. Early career Day's origins and the events of his early life remain obscure. Scholars have assumed that Day was born and raised in Dunwich, but there is no direct evidence that proves this claim.Evenden. Day owned a house in Dunwich. Other scholars suggest that Day may have been foreign-born, but the evidence supporting this claim is inconclusive as well. He may have been in London by 1540, as his name is mentioned in a city deposition as being a former servant of the printer and physician Thomas Raynalde. In 1546, he was probably one of twenty men who were granted the freedom of the city by redemption to work for the Stringers' Company of London.Pettegree. The next year, he began printing with a partner, William Seres; the two based their operations at the parish of St Sepulchre in London.Alford, 118. Day and Seres specialised in religious works, such as those by Robert Crowley, which were largely related to theological controversies of the time.King, Book trade, 167. The Protestant Reformation was advancing rapidly, and the laws against the publication of heretical works were being relaxed. In 1548, ten of the twenty works that the two men published were devoted to criticizing the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. One of those publications, a satirical poem by Luke Shepherd titled Iohn Bon and Mast Person, almost landed Day in jail.Evenden. An evangelical Yeoman of the Guard named Edward Underhill prevented Day's arrest. Day and Seres also translated important works of Continental Protestantism for the English market, notably Herman von Wied's A Simple and Religious Consultation in 1547.Evenden. In 1549, Day opened a new shop in Cheapside, and the next year, he and Seres were successful enough to amicably separate their businesses.Alford, 118‚Äì19. Day set up his new home and printing establishment at Aldersgate in the parish of St Anne and St Agnes and transferred from the Stringers' to the Stationers' Company. Day found Aldersgate's foreigner-friendly attributes helpful in attracting skilled Dutch workers, whom he relied on throughout his career. He soon established himself as a quality printer, and in 1551, he reprinted an elaborate edition of the Bible that he had previously produced with Seres.Alford, 119. The next year, he secured a valuable patent to print the works of John Ponet and Thomas Beccon. This enraged one of his competitors, Reginald Wolfe, who already held a patent to print Ponet's Catechism in Latin. Eventually, a compromise patent was issued which allowed Wolfe to continue printing the Catechism in Latin and Day to print the work in English. Day reaped more benefits from the deal than Wolfe: the English printings were used far more extensively than the Latin ones, and the ABC was eventually appended with Ponet's Catechism. With a reputation for Protestant godliness and connections to people like John Dudley, William Cecil, and Catherine Willoughby, a successful career seemed assured for Day. Unfortunately for Day, Queen Mary ascended the throne in 1553 and the entire religious climate of the country changed. For years, it was thought that at the accession of Mary, Day fled to the Continent to avoid persecution. However, typographical and other evidence has convinced scholars that Day set up a clandestine press in premises connected to William Cecil in Lincolnshire,Foxe reported that Sir William Cooke \\"was committed to vile prison for that he suffered this our printer to print\\" a prohibited book. Cooke was the brother-in-law of William Cecil, who supported a secret press that Day operated at Stamford, Lincolnshire. King, Book of Martyrs, 82. and that he continued to print Protestant polemical works under the pseudonym Michael Wood.Fairfield, 221. The \\"Michael Wood\\" pamphlets included Protestant writings by Lady Jane Grey, John Hooper, and Stephen Gardiner, and attacks on Mary and her advisors.King, Book trade, 172. On 16 October 1554, according to the diary of Henry Machyn, Day was caught and sent to the Tower of London for printing \\"naughty books\\".Machyn writes in that day's entry: \\"The xvj day of October cam rydyng owt of Northfoke on John Day prynter and ys servand, and a prest, and an-odur prynter, for pryntyng of noythy bokes, to the Towre.\\" King, Book of Martyrs, 82. In the Book of Martyrs, Foxe records statements made in prison to Day by the future martyr John Rogers, \\"spake being then in prison, to the Printer of this present booke, who then also was layd up for lyke cause of religion\\".Rogers was executed in February 1555. King, Book of Martyrs, 82. Perhaps because the flight of foreign Protestant workers under Mary was causing a shortage of printers, Day was released the next year and allowed to work again, but only as a jobbing printer.Evenden and Roberts. He reunited with Seres (also recently released from prison) to produce works of Catholicism for Catholic printer John Wayland, a far cry from the Protestant polemics he printed prior to imprisonment.King, Book of Martyrs, 173. He also served as the official printer of the City of London for two years. Elizabethan period A page from Cuningham's Cosmographical Glasse printed by Day in 1559 With the death of Mary and the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558, Day's business blossomed once more. Day was already close to Cecil, who had now become one of the new Queen's top advisors. Through Cecil, Day was awarded the valuable monopoly on printing ABCs. He also befriended Robert Dudley (son of John Dudley), another of Elizabeth's favorites. With the help of his connections, Day was able to obtain a lucrative patent to print William Cuningham's Cosmographical Glasse.During this period, the sovereign could grant patents to favored printers, giving them monopolies over particular works, often for a fixed number of years. These royal patents were not subject to regulation by the Stationers' Company, which otherwise controlled the book trade. He produced the first edition in 1559 using a new italic font of the highest quality (probably cut by Fran√ßois Guyot) and a large number of impressive woodcuts. Day absorbed the high production costs himself, since he knew the work would solidify his reputation as a master printer. Day's patent to print Cuningham‚Äîhis first under Elizabeth‚Äîgave him exclusive rights to the work for life; it also allowed him to retain a monopoly for seven years on any other original works that were not covered by other patents, were \\"compiled at Day's expense\\",King, John Day, 204. and were \\"not repugnant to Holy Scripture or the law\\". This stipulation would be an important source of income for the rest of his life. Day took advantage of the monopoly clause, reestablishing his Edwardian patent for The ABC with Little Catechism. In 1559, he obtained a patent for The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Collected into English Meter, a metrical psalter, compiled mostly by Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins, that Day first published in 1562.Miller. The Stationers' Company guaranteed Day the right to print all \\"psalmes in metre with note\\", in other words, psalms with music. Despite the fact that psalmes had usually been learned by rote, the business proved lucrative, reflecting a rise in musical literacy during the period.Smith, 24. The Whole Booke of Psalmes became the period's best-selling book and the standard English psalter of its time. Day's monopolies on these perennially popular works would be the basis of great wealth over the years and a good deal of conflict between him and his fellow stationers. In legal proceedings towards the end of Day's life, it was estimated that these particular patents were worth between ¬£200 and ¬£500 per year. =Actes and Monuments= Woodcut from Day's 1563 first printing of John Foxe's Actes and Monuments depicting the execution of Thomas Cranmer, 1556 In 1563, Day undertook the work for which he is best known, John Foxe's Actes and Monuments (also called The Book of Martyrs). Day and Foxe probably met through Cecil, and the two became close collaborators. Foxe was among those who seized on the advances in the printing trade as a tool for the spread of the Protestant Reformation.Foxe wrote: \\"It pleased God to open to man, the art of Printyng, the tyme whereof was shortely after the burnyng of Hus and Hierome. Printyng being opened, incontinent [ie. immediately] ministred to the Church, the instrumentes and tooles of learnyng and knowledge\\". King, Book of Martyrs, 71. There is a tradition that Foxe, who revised and added material while the book was being set in type, actually lived at Day's shop at Aldersgate during the production of the book; he certainly received correspondence there and visited regularly.\\"At Mr Daies the printer dwellyng over Aldersgate beneth S. martens \\". King, Book of Martyrs, 80. Day heavily invested time and money in the production of Foxe's book, the largest publishing project undertaken in England to that time,Hattaway, 44. and he took an active part in the compilation of the material.King, Book of Martyrs, 32. Day used changes in type sizes or fonts to distinguish Foxe's editorial insertions from texts of his sources.King, Book of Martyrs, 58. The resulting lavish folio filled with woodcuts was an expensive luxury item,The Protestant controversialist William Turner objected to the book's costliness: \\"not a few of the poor have complained about the great price of the book, who...because of poverty and the lack of means, cannot obtain godly books for themselves, while the rich, for the most part, obtain them out of ostentation, in order that they may seem godly\\". Letter of 20 November 1563. King, Book of Martyrs, 111. but it sold well and Day profited from his investment. Woodcut from John Foxe's Actes and Monuments depicting the burning of Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley in 1555 Day continued to take on challenging and difficult projects. He had already printed the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham.King, Book of Martyrs, 121. For this work, Day, known for his fine and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by Fran√ßois Guyot, a French type-founder known to have worked for Day and lived in his household.King, Book of Martyrs, 85‚Äì86. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he printed Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams‚Äîone of the first printed books ever to do so. In the same year, he printed Ascham's Scholemaster. Day and Foxe completed a second edition of the Book of Martyrs in 1570. It was even larger than the first‚Äîa total of 2,300 pages in two enormous folio volumes‚Äîand at one point, Day ran out of paper (which he imported) and had to paste smaller sheets together to make do.King, Book of Martyrs, 88. This edition received official recognition: William Cecil and the Privy Council directed the church to ensure that copies were available to parishioners, and in 1571, the Convocation ordered that every cathedral church and the household of every senior member of the clergy should own a copy.King, Book of Martyrs, 112. The edition has been recorded as costing sixteen shillings, roughly equivalent to two months' wages for a skilled London clothworker at the time.King, Book of Martyrs, 88‚Äì89. =Final years= By the late 1570s, there was open discontent among the less wealthy members of the Stationers' Company about Day's extensive patents. He was compelled to go to court against printers who pirated works to which he owned the rights. Among those brought to trial was Roger Ward, who admitted to pirating 10,000 copies of ABC with Catechisms in a font which imitated Day's. Day's former apprentice and sub-contractor John Wolfe admitted in court that he had pirated The Whole Booke of Psalmes but justified his actions on the grounds that Day's monopolies were a restraint of trade.Smith, 24‚Äì25. It was Wolfe who led a group of \\"poor printers\\", as they called themselves, in a campaign against the patents in the late 1570s.In their \\"Complaynt\\" to the Privy Council, the \\"poor printers\\" claimed that \\"the privilidges latelie granted by her Majestie under her hignes great seale of England...Concerninge the arte of printing of bookes hath and will be the overthrowe of the Printers and Stacioners within this Cittie\\". Smith, 25. As a result of an official investigation, Day was eventually obliged to concede certain titles to the Company for the benefit of the poorer printers, but he kept the titles he printed most.Smith, 25. John Day commemorative tablet, Edinburgh Central Library In 1580, Day became Master of the Stationers' Company, and focused vigorously on defending the industry against piracy.Smith, 184. His official powers included the right of \\"search and seizure\\", which he did not hesitate to exercise on behalf of the trade or to further his own interests. In 1584, he sent men to break into Wolfe's premises and destroy any materials relating to suspected piracy. Four years before, he had even destroyed his son Richard's printing equipment after Richard had printed the ABC and the Psalmes without his permission. Though Richard was technically co-patentee of these titles, John Day pursued him into the courts and all but destroyed his printing career.Smith, 27. In 1582, Day's health began to deteriorate quickly. Though weakening, he raced to complete another edition of Actes and Monuments in 1583, printing it on at least four presses.King, Book of Martyrs, 84. It was unusual for books of this size and ambition to go beyond one or two printings. Holinshed's Chronicles, the only book of the time to rival the Book of Martyrs in scope and reputation, never went into a third edition.King, Book of Martyrs, 91. Day died on 23 July 1584 at Walden in Essex. He married twice and fathered thirteen children in each marriage. Day's printer's device showed a sleeper awakening, with the motto \\"Arise for it is Day,\\" both a play on his name and an allusion to the new era of religious reform, in which he was a significant figure.

Originally from Dunblane in Scotland he moved to New Zealand with his family when he was 17. Musical career After a stint as a teenager in the late '70's playing rhythm guitar in working men's clubs and other unlicensed venues with Gavin Keen (lead guitar), Graeme Dooley (drums) and Spike Quinn (bass) in 60's covers band Feedback. In 1980, while he was a student at the University of Otago in Dunedin, he co-founded the band Sneaky Feelings, for which he was vocalist, lead guitarist, and songwriter. After the band dissolved in 1989, Bannister formed Dribbling Darts and worked as a journalist and reviewer. Both bands had music released on the Flying Nun record label. He has also worked briefly with The Mutton Birds. He released a solo album, Moth, in 2007 as One Man Bannister. In 2008 he released an album with The Weather called Aroha Ave, and in 2011 a self-titled album with The Changing Same. =Positively George Street= In the mid-1990s, Bannister began writing a memoir about his experiences as a musician in the 1980s Dunedin scene. Partly, this was a response to concerns he had over being \\"written out\\" of New Zealand's indie music history: \\"I published a book ... about Sneaky Feelings because I felt we were being written out of the label's history and indeed out of indie history, for example our non-appearance in various articles about Flying Nun, in indie discographies, and in local ... rock polls\\".Matthew Bannister, \\"'Loaded': Indie Guitar Rock, Canonism, White Masculinities,\\" Popular Music 25, no. 1 (2006): 79 This book, Positively George Street, was published in 1999. Academic career In 1998, Bannister returned to full-time study as a PhD candidate in the Department of Film, TV and Media Studies at the University of Auckland, graduating in 2003. His thesis was entitled White Man's Soul: Pakeha masculinities in popular music of New Zealand / Aotearoa. A revised version of the thesis appeared as a book, White Boys, White Noise: Masculinities and 1980s Guitar Rock, in the Ashgate Popular Music and Folk Series in 2006. He now works at the Waikato Institute of Technology (WINTEC) as Theory/Post Graduate advisor in the School of Media Arts. Personal life Bannister's father was a botanist working at Otago University.

Biography =Early life= Together with his brother, Stanis≈Çaw Kazanowski (starost of Krosno, Jawor√≥w and Przedbor), Adam was raised with crown prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw. He accompanied him during his attempt to become a Russian Tzar, in the Chocim war of 1621 and the 1620s European voyage. In 1631 he became the starost of Barcko. When W≈Çadys≈Çaw became king in 1634, he was showered with gifts and new official titles. In 1634 he became the starost of Borysowo, and gained the rank of podstoli and soon after that, stolnik. Later that year he married El≈ºbieta S≈Çuszczanka (later Hieronimowa Radziejowska, when she married Hieronim Radziejowski), but the couple stayed childless.:pl:Adam Kazanowski (ok. 1599-1649) =Royal titles and wealth= As a sign of friendship, W≈Çadys≈Çaw bestowed many favours, positions and gifts to Kazanowski, who soon had his own palace in Warsaw. He soon became the richest magnate in Poland, and owned close to half of the Praga district in the capital. A contemporary writer, after his death, wrote: Never has Poland seen so much wealth in a private hand of a single man. Those many favours, especially coupled with both Kazanowski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw lavish spending, raised many protests from the Commonwealth's parliament. They had, however, little effect on both Kazanowski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw. =Opinion and influence= Kazanowski was viewed by many as a greedy, arrogant magnate with a 'bad influence' on the king, but he always remained close to W≈Çadys≈Çaw. When W≈Çadys≈Çaw's royal treasury ran dry once, Adam Kazanowski loaned him his money and mortgaged many of his goods, saying My liege, I cannot become poor when I am near to you, but I will not be rich without you. This friendship gave him enough political leverage to remain an important player in the Commonwealth's politics. Privy to the king's thoughts and secrets, and organiser of many lavish parties and festivities, he was not interested in the 'great (foreign) politics', but he was a powerful player in the smaller court intrigues. He knew many secrets of the royal court, and could influence W≈Çadys≈Çaw to be friendly or not towards various newcomers, envoys and other visitors to the court. His influence did diminish after 1637, when W≈Çadys≈Çaw married Habsburg Archduchess Cecilia Renata of Austria. After that, Kazanowski became an enemy of the queen and other Habsburg supporters, like Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski, and allied himself with Piotr Gembicki (chancellor until 1642). =Death= Kazanowski died in 1649 and was buried in St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw.Kazanowscy See also *Kazanowski Palace *Krzysztofory Palace *Bielsk Podlaski References External links * internautica.pl Portrait of Adam Kazanowski in red ≈ºupan by Peter Danckerts de Rij (display at Wawel Castle) Secular senators of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth 1599 births 1649 deaths Adam Burials at St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw ","title":"Adam Kazanowski"},{"id":"1372230","text":"The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) is a non-profit organization funded by the National Cancer Institute with the purpose of supporting research for the prevention and treatment of all gynecologic cancers, such as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, vulvar cancer, and vaginal cancer.

Band members are Salim Vera (vocals, guitars), Antonio Jauregui (bass), Manolo Hidalgo (lead guitar), Jeffry Fischman (drums) (1996‚Äì2005) and Ivan Mindreau (drums) (2005‚Äì2009), luego entrar√≠a wilder Lopez (2009-2017),actualmente el baterista es Hugo Ortiz . They are winners of two Los Premios MTV Latinoam√©rica, in the categories: Best Artist ‚Äî Southwest (2002), and Best Artist ‚Äî Central (2003) and have toured all over Peru. History =1996‚Äì2000: early years - Libido= They released their self-titled album Libido in 1998. It included hit singles like \\"Como un perro\\" and \\"Sed\\". L√≠bido started touring all over the country. As a result of the success of its first album, the group began to play at Peru's premier venues; meanwhile, their music began to be noticed by North American radio stations with Spanish rock programming, in specialized magazines, and on music web sites. =2000‚Äì2002: Hembra= In 2000, the band took a break from touring to record their second album titled Hembra. It was produced by Tweety Gonz√°lez and mixed by Doug Trantow, and was recorded in Buenos Aires and Los Angeles. This album marked the beginning of L√≠bido's working relationship with Sony Music, which helped reinforce its presence in the Peruvian market; the market had already been struck by a high level of piracy. The album became number 1 in Peru and the single 'En esta habitaci√≥n'.. With this album they achieved two #1 hits in the rankings of local radio stations with the singles 'Tres' and 'En esta habitaci√≥n'. The music videos for the singles were directed by Juan Pablo Olivares y Picky Talarico, respectively. After this, they took their music to places such as Buenos Aires, Argentina (Buenos Aires Hot Festival in January 2001); the United States (the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, in March 2001; the ASCAP AMPT Music Series Miami in October 2000, and headlining the Show to benefit IRC Miami Chapter in December 2001); Caracas, Venezuela (Festival Nuevas Bandas 2001); and Santiago, Chile (July 2001). During this period they received on behalf of their recording house gold and platinum albums which certified the high sales of 'Hembra' in Peru: its sales in that country were about the same as its sales throughout all the rest of the American continent. During 2001 they continued headlining festivals in Peru: the Festival de la Cerveza in Cuzco (June 2000) and Arequipa (August 2001 and 2002); the Feria del Hogar (Lima, August 2001); and the Lima Music Fest (November 2001). Throughout this time, they continued holding concerts throughout the country. September 2002 was a high point in the life of the group. They received a nomination in the first MTV Video Music Awards Latinoam√©rica and terminated their contract with Sony Music. September was also the start of the recording of their third disc in Estudios Panda (Argentina), under the production of the Canadian Duane Baron and mixing engineer Thom Russo. In October 2002, L√≠bido won the Best South-West Artist honor at the MTV Latin American VMAs. This was a great moment for Peruvian rock music since it marked the first international recognition received by any Peruvian rock band. =2002‚Äì2005: Pop*Porn= In December 2002, the band released their third album Pop*Porn which repeated the success of Hembra, certified double platinum for its high sales volume in only three days on the market. Their single \\"Fr√°gil\\" was number one for three weeks on MTV and was nominated for a MTV Video Music Award. In March 2003, L√≠bido again took part in the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. This was a preamble to their first U.S. tour. The music video for 'Fr√°gil' ('Fragile') had a strong presence on MTV Central, and had the top spot in the Top 20 for three consecutive weeks. In June, the band participated again in the Festival de la Cerveza Cuzque√±a. At the start of July 2003, Pop*Porn was released in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Ecuador, and Colombia. In October 2003, L√≠bido again triumphed at the second Latin American MTV Video Music Awards (VMALAs), when they won the \\"Best Central Artist\\" category for the second consecutive year. This also involved their participation in a live Pre-Show for the VMALAs, which was the first performance by a Peruvian rock band to be broadcast live to all of North America. In the second half of 2003, the group continued traversing South America with appearances in the Festival de la Cerveza Pace√±a in La Paz (Bolivia) and the Cabildo Rock & Pop Festival in Montevideo (Uruguay). Meanwhile, in December 2003, 'pop*porn' was published in Argentina by Alerta! Discos (owned by Zeta Bosio), and Chile. In 2004, L√≠bido recommenced its activities with the filming of their new video for 'No Ser√° lo Mismo Sin Ti' ('It won't be the same without you'). In December 2004, L√≠bido released their first live album titled L√≠bido Ac√∫stica. After a long break at the beginning of 2005, original drummer Jeffry Fischman left the band for personal reasons, and to continue his studies in the US, with his replacement Ivan Mindreau behind the drums. =2005‚Äì2009: Lo √öltimo que Hable Ayer= By October 2005, their new album, Lo √öltimo que Hable Ayer ('The last thing I said Yesterday'), was released. Instead of the rock sound that made L√≠bido famous, they chose a more experimental sound. With their first radio single \\"Culpable\\", they began their promotion for the new album. It was very controversial among fans, who claimed that it wasn't the same without Jeffry Fischman and that L√≠bido's music has been going downhill. = 2009‚Äì2010: Un D√≠a Nuevo and Rarezas = After four years of hiatus, Libido returned with the studio album Un D√≠a Nuevo, which was released on July 16, 2009. Months before the release of Un D√≠a Nuevo, Libido had begun a publicity strategy through the mobile phone network Claro. Its two singles are Nadie Sabe lo que Vendra and Malvada. After Un Dia Nuevo album came out, the band decided to record another studio album. This new album would include some old songs that did not make it on previous albums. It was released along with a DVD featuring the band's greatest hits. After the release, the band set out to tour around the country. = 2012- 2015: Other Presentations = A few years after touring passed and they decided to make a new album. With the new band member, they confirmed to go out and perform again. In May, the band was invited to participate in a private concert for Terra Live Music in which they presented \\"Cuelgo el Telefono, \\"El instinto del Actor\\", \\"La Info\\" and \\"Ya no me Juzgues\\". After this, Ivan Mindreau left the band and Wilder Lopez came in and took his place as drummer. In this year, Antonio Jauregui, bassist and co founder of the band, decided to leave the band for personal reasons. There appeared to be some discrepancies with the other members of the group regarding musical preferences and production. Juan Pablo del Aguila, summoned by Wilder, came along for a rehearsal. Juan Pablo then became the new bass player of the band and they established the new and current formation of the band and began working on a more modern sound and started to rehearse and perform a lot more often, again. For the new year, with the new member of the group, they performed in a few festivals around Lima. On July 6, the band released an album/DVD \\"Sesion en vivo\\". This album was recorded during the first month of the year in the Casino Atlantic City, Miraflores, Lima - Peru. This new production included many re-made songs from older albums and a couple of new tunes among which was their latest \\"Tan Suave\\". This was the official presentation of the new young members of the band. New blood, a new sound. The band announced to make a new production from the previous years. On May 23 the band participated in Festival Vivo X El Rock5. = 2016- present: Amar o matar = The New EP is called \\"Amar o Matar\\". It's got six songs. The first song released as a single \\"Pero A√∫n Sigo Vi√©ndote\\" They released a Video clip of this single on YouTube on the third week of January. The video has over 100k views so far.

History Ma'agan Michael boat Amedeo Modigliani, 1907, Portrait of Maude Abrantes, oil on canvas, 81 x 54 cm The Hecht Museum was established in 1984 by Reuben Hecht, director of Dagon Silos and a founding member of the University of Haifa Board of Governors. For sixty years, Hecht collected archaeological artefacts representing the material culture of the Land of Israel in ancient times. He was particularly interested in finds from the Canaanite period to the end of the Byzantine period. Hecht believed that archeology was an important expression of Zionism and these ancient artifacts were proof of the link between the Jewish people and Eretz Israel. Exhibits Exhibits display the archaeology and history of the Land of Israel in chronological sequence, from the Chalcolithic period to the Byzantine period. Exhibits include coins, weights, Semitic seals, jewelry, artifacts from the Temple Mount excavations; Phoenician metalworking, woodworking, stone vessels, glass making, and mosaics. The museum is also home to the Ma'agan Michael Ship, the wreck of a fifth-century BCE merchantman. The museum art collection includes French painting of the Barbizon School, Impressionism, Post-impressionism, and the School of Paris, and Jewish art from mid-nineteenth to early twentieth century. The museum owns paintings by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, √âdouard Manet, Claude Monet, Camille Jacob Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh, Amedeo Modigliani, Max Liebermann. Activities The museum has an acoustic auditorium that seats 380 and a pipe organ, built by Gideon Shamir from parts of organs used in churches throughout the country over a century ago. It also serves as a study center for students and academic researchers, offering enrichment studies in archaeology, art, Bible, and history for schoolchildren, soldiers, teachers and the public at large. The Museum holds an annual art competition open to high-school students, soldiers, and fine arts students. Winners of the competition are granted scholarships by the Hecht Foundation, which also awards fellowships to M.A. and Ph.D. students in the Departments of Archeology and Maritime Civilizations. The Museum holds conferences, symposia, seminars, and lectures and publishes catalogs of its exhibitions of archeology and art. Journal Michmanim, the museum journal, publishes scholarly articles on archaeological research and artifacts in the museum collection.

There is no evidence that the former accountant turned researcher Mignol had knowledge of Hamilton or Savage's earlier work when he began his experiments in 1941.

Denial: Why Business Leaders Fail to Look Facts in the Face---and What to Do About It March 4, 2010 Retrieved July 26, 2015 In 1968, Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of the radial tire design, documenting its longer tread life, better steering characteristics, and less rolling resistance, which increases gas mileage.Consumer Reports, \\"Tires,\\" Consumer Reports, (August 1968): 404-409.Welch, David Bloomberg Businessweek A Tale of Two Tires May 4, 2006 Retrieved July 26, 2015 In 1970, Ford Motor Company produced the first American-made vehicle with radial tires as standard equipment, Michelin tires fitted to the Continental Mark III.Vaughan, Daniel Conceptcarz.com 1969 Lincoln Continental news, pictures, specifications, and information September 2008 Retrieved July 26, 2015 In 1974, Charles J. Pilliod, Jr., the new CEO of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, faced a major investment decision regarding retooling for the radial tire, following the 1973 oil crisis. Despite heavy criticism at the time, Pilliod invested heavily in new factories and tooling to build the radial tire. Today, only Goodyear, Cooper, Titan and Specialty Tires of America remain independent among US tire manufacturers, and the radial has a market share of 100%. Sam Gibara, who headed Goodyear from 1996 to 2003, has noted that without the action of Pilliod, Goodyear \\"wouldn't be around today.\\" In 1974, Pirelli developed the wide radial tire on a request of the Lancia rally racing team for a tire to handle the power of the new Lancia Stratos and in the succeeding year, Pirelli introduced a wide tire with a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial construction for the Monte Carlo Rally winning works Stratos. Radial technology is now the standard design for essentially all automotive tires. Bias tires are still used on trailers due to their weight carrying ability and resistance to swaying when towed. For aircraft, the transition is happening more slowly, as tires are certified along with the airframe. A radial has less material in the sidewall, so it weighs less, runs cooler and lasts longer. For smaller planes, bias tires afford more stability at higher speeds and have stronger sidewalls.  Construction  A series of plies of cord reinforces a tire. Without this, a tire would be flexible and weak. The network of cords that gives the tire strength and shape is called the carcass. Since the 1960s, all common tires have a carcass of cords of polyester, steel, or other textile materials, inlaid with several layers of rubber. In the past, the fabric was built up on a flat steel drum, with the cords at angles of about +60 and ‚àí60 degrees from the direction of travel, so they criss-crossed over each other. They were called cross ply or bias ply tires. The plies were turned up around the steel wire beads and the combined tread/sidewall applied. The green (uncured) tire was loaded over a curing bladder and shaped into the mold. This shaping process caused the cords in the tire to assume an S-shape from bead to bead. The angle under the tread, the crown angle, stretched down to about 36 degrees. In the sidewall region the angle was 45 degrees, and in the bead it remained at 60 degrees. The low crown angle gave rigidity to support the tread and the high sidewall angle gave comfort. To increase strength, the manufacturer would increase the number of plies, and the heat buildup in the tire.Kraus, James Autouniversum.wordpress.com Michelin and the birth of the radial tire March 7, 2011 Retrieved July 26, 2015 By comparison, radial tires lay all of the cord plies at 90 degrees to the direction of travel (that is, across the tire from lip to lip). This design avoids having the plies rub against each other as the tire flexes, reducing the tire's rolling friction. This allows vehicles with radial tires to achieve better fuel economy than with bias-ply tires. It also accounts for the slightly \\"low on air\\" (bulging) look that radial tire sidewalls have, especially when compared to bias-ply tires. With only radial cords, a radial tire would not be sufficiently rigid at the contact with the ground. To add further stiffness, the entire tire is surrounded by additional belts oriented closer to the direction of travel, but usually at some \\"spiral\\" angle. These belts can be made of steel (hence the term steel-belted radial), polyester, or Aramid fibers such as Twaron or Kevlar. In this way, low radial tires separate the tire carcass into two separate systems: * The radial cords in the sidewall allow it to act like a spring, giving flexibility and ride comfort. * The rigid steel belts reinforce the tread region, giving high mileage and performance. Each system can then be individually optimized for best performance. Application Radial tires have different characteristics of springiness from those of bias-ply tires, and a different degree of slip while steering. A benefit was that cars could now be made lighter because they would not have to make up for the deficiencies of bias-ply tires. However, motorists were not accustomed to the feel, hence the suspension systems of cars had to be modified. Ford Motor Company engineer Jack Bajer experimented in the 1960s on a Ford Falcon, by giving it less tight steering, and adding both isolators to the drive shaft and bushings to the suspension, the latter being to absorb the thump of riding over asphalt expansion joints in a concrete roadway. Radial tires have occasionally found application on bicycles, used on the 1980s Miyata touring bicycle; models 1000 and 610,Sheldon Brown: Japanese cycles in the American market: http://www.sheldonbrown.com/japan.html#miyata and more recently in 2009 on the Maxxis Radiale.Maxxis Radiale: Panaracer radial tires were also standard on the Jamis Gentry model bicycle in 1985. The steel wires in radial tires become magnetized with use, so as they rotate, an alternating magnetic field is created. It is quite measurable with an EMF meter close to the wheel well when the wheel is rotating, and is rich in harmonics up to several hundred hertz. Features The advantages of radial tires over bias ply: * Flexible sidewalls * Reduced fuel consumption due to less rolling resistance * A softer ride because of the layout of the tire's plies and because of the flex of the sidewalls. This assumes equivalent profiles between the two tires (also, as stated above, at lower speeds radial-ply tires will react more harshly to ridges in the road such as expansion joints). * More stable contact with the road surface. * Steel Belted ‚Äì Results in tougher overall construction * Longer Tread Life * Wider Footprint * Less ground compaction and damage * Reduction in tire replacement due to less heat generated by the tire. * Reduced machine maintenance costs.

He is best known for his writings and speeches about technology, society, and engineering culture. Bob is a Fellow of the IEEE and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He is also a member of TTI/Vanguard's advisory board. Early life Robert Lucky was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and went to high school in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He studied electrical engineering at Purdue University, graduating with a BSEE in 1957. He stayed on at Purdue and was granted an MSEE in 1959. Continuing at Purdue he did his PhD research under John C Hancock, writing a thesis on simultaneous amplitude modulated and phase modulated digital communication. In his thesis he derived two-dimensional signal constellations that are similar to those used in the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) systems commonly used in high speed digital communications today. He received his PhD from Purdue in 1961. Career Lucky joined Bell Labs in 1961, where his initial assignment was in the Data Theory Department under William R Bennett. In 1964 he made his best known invention, the adaptive equalizer, and in the years to follow he was promoted a number of times, becoming in 1982 the executive director of the communications sciences research division. This division comprised essentially all of the Bell Labs research on wireless, optical systems, and other communications systems topics, as well as some of the Bell Labs research on physics and computer science. Two Nobel Prizes were won by researchers in the division. Lucky left Bell Labs in 1992 and joined Bellcore, the research laboratory for the divested Bell Telephone companies, where he was corporate vice president, responsible for management of research. A few years later Bellcore was sold to SAIC (Science Applications International) and renamed Telcordia Technologies. Robert Lucky retired from Telcordia in 2002. Adaptive equalizer In the early 1960s the highest speed for modems on telephone lines was 2400 bits per second. Higher speeds were not possible because of intersymbol interference. Each dialed connection would have a different distorting effect on the series of pulses sent to convey digital information, smearing successive pulses and entangling them, resulting in errors in detection. Lucky invented a way to adaptively undo the smearing effects by automatic adjustment of a variable filter, using a tapped delay line with adjustable gains at each tap. The equalizer used a steepest descent algorithm to minimize distortion. It was initially trained by a series of known pulses, but during actual data transmission it relied upon decision- directed adjustment, which assumed that decisions about pulses were largely correct and could be used for reconstruction of the ongoing error. The first adaptive equalizer, in 1964, used 13 adjustable gains, each set by 8 relays. The rack of equipment was about 5 feet high. Its use immediately made possible data transmission at 9600 bits per second ‚Äì four times the highest previously attainable speed. Shortly thereafter, the relays were replaced with transistor switches, then in succeeding years the equalizer was implemented with a special purpose integrated circuit. Today adaptive equalization is built into almost every modem and is simply a subroutine in the instruction program for an embedded microprocessor. Advisory positions Throughout his career, Lucky has been heavily involved in advisory and participatory roles in engineering societies, universities, and government. In the IEEE he has been editor of the Proceedings of the IEEE, president of the Communications Society, and executive vice president of the parent IEEE. His government service included being chairman of the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Technological Advisory Council, chairman of the statutory visiting committee of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and membership on the Defense Science Board. He also has been active with the National Academy of Engineering and on the advisory boards of a number of universities. Honors and awards Among his honors, Lucky has been awarded four honorary doctorate degrees, the 1987 Marconi Prize, the 1995 IEEE Edison Medal, and the 1998 Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and to both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. Writings He is the author (with J Salz and EJ Weldon) of a textbook, Principles of Data Communications (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1965). He wrote a popularized account of information theory in Silicon Dreams (St Martins Press, New York, 1989). A compilation of his essays was published under the title Lucky Strikes Again (Wiley/IEEE Press, 1992). Since 1982 he has written a bi-monthly column, Reflections, in IEEE Spectrum Magazine, which features his essays on technology and engineering culture. Later career Since retirement in 2002, Lucky has been a member of the Defense Science Board, chairman of the board of ANSER, Inc., a member of the Laboratory Operations Board of the United States Department of Energy, chairman of Marconi Society, and a member of advisory board of TTI/Vanguard. The governor of New Jersey appointed him to the Authority for the Redevelopment of Fort Monmouth, and he was elected chairman of that Authority.

Artemidoros Aniketos (Greek: ; epithet means \\"the Invincible\\") was a king who ruled in the area of Gandhara and Pushkalavati in modern northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. A son of Maues? Artemidoros has a Greek name and has traditionally been seen as an Indo-Greek king. His remaining coins generally feature portraits of Artemidoros and Hellenistic deities and are typical of Indo-Greek rulers, but on a coin described by numismatician R. C. Senior, Artemidoros seems to claim to be the son of the Indo-Scythian king Maues. Not only does this coin enable a closer dating of Artemidoros; it also sheds new light on the transient ethnic identities during the decline of the Indo-Greek kingdom. While Maues was 'Great King of Kings', Artemidoros only styled himself King; it appears as though he ruled only a smaller part of his father's dominions. He was either challenged by or ruled in tandem with other kings such as Menander II, whose coins have been found alongside his, and Apollodotus II. =New evaluation= Coin showing the additional letter \\"Cha\\" after \\"Putasa\\". In a 2009 article however,Osmund Bopearachchi Was Indo-Greek Artemidoros the son of Indo-Sctythian Maues Bopearachchi disputes the interpretation of the coin according to which Artemidoros would be son of Maues. The analysis of several similar coins in good condition and cleaned-up reveals that the obverse should be read rajatirajasa moasa putrasa ca artemidorosa, the ca (pronounced \\"cha\\") meaning \\"and\\", which opens the way to a possible translation being \\"King of kings Maues, and the son of Artemidoros\\". This would suggest that the son of Artemidoros would have issued coins in the name of his father, recognizing at the same time the suzerainty of Maues. In that case, Artemidoros would have been a regular Indo-Greek king, whose son simply made a transition with the rule of Maues. Time of rule Bopearachchi has suggested a date of c. 85-80 BCE, but this was before the appearance of the Maues coin. Senior's dating is wider, c. 100‚Äì80 BCE, because Senior has given Maues an earlier date. Coins During the 1990s, several new types of Artemidoros' coins appeared, of variable quality. R. C. Senior has suggested that Artemidoros relied mostly on temporary mints, perhaps because he held no major cities. All his coins were Indian bilinguals.

It is one of the major Somali clans, with a vast traditional territory spanning 3 major regions of Somalia: Bari, Nugaal and Mudug. From Bosaso down to Garacad, the Majerteen are settled in what is literally considered to be the 'Horn of Africa'. Its members form a part of the Darod clan family, and primarily inhabit the Puntland state of northeastern Somalia. The Majeerteen Sultanates played an important role in the pre-independence era of Somalia. Majeerteens also held many other significant government posts in the 1960s and 1970s, and continue to play a key role in Puntland state and Somalia as a whole. Territory The Majeerteen are traditionally settled in Somalia's northern regions of Bari, Nugal and Mudug.Royal African Society, African Affairs, Volume 101, (Oxford University Press: 2002) p.101. They can also be found in Kismayo in southern Somalia due to migrations starting in the 19th century along with their fellow members of the larger Harti subclan, the Dhulbahante, Dishiishe and Warsangeli. The Majeerteen are traditionally settled in the land in-between Bandar Siyada an ancient port town facing the Gulf of Aden, and Garacad a coastal port town, facing the Indian Ocean and all the land in between which corresponds to the area encompassing the Horn of Africa. Therefore, the Majerteen are settled in what is literally considered to be 'the Horn of Africa'. Some Majeerteen people are also found in the Somali Region internationally referred to Ogaden, specifically in the Hawd region near the Somalia border. The Majeerteen are part of Darod subclans within Somalia. The Majeerteen are more commonly found in the cities of Bosaso, Garowe and Galkacyo which are all regional capitals of Bari, Somalia, Nugal, Somalia and Mudug respectively. Majeerteen Kingdoms Majeerteen ruler Ali Yusuf Kenadid, 2nd Sultan of the Sultanate of Hobyo. Before the famous Majeerteen Sultanate there was the Sultanate of Amaanle (Abdirahman Awe) which was overthrown and overtaken by Osman Mahamuud who became the subsequent King and Sultan. The Majeerteen Sultanate was founded in the early-18th century. It rose to prominence in the following century, under the reign of the resourceful King (Boqor) Osman Mahamuud.Helen Chapin Metz, Somalia: a country study, (The Division: 1993), p.10. His Sultanate controlled Bari Karkaar, Nugaaal and also central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity maintained a robust trading network, entered into treaties with foreign powers, and exerted strong centralized authority on the domestic front.Horn of Africa, Volume 15, Issues 1-4, (Horn of Africa Journal: 1997), p.130.Transformation towards a regulated economy, (WSP Transition Programme, Somali Programme: 2000) p.62. Osman Mahamuud's Sultanate was nearly destroyed in the late-1800s by a power struggle between himself and his ambitious cousin, Yusuf Ali Kenadid who founded the Sultanate of Hobyo in 1878. Initially he wanted to seize control of the neighbouring Majeerteen Sultanate, ruled by his cousin Boqor Osman Mahamud. However, Yusuf Ali Kenadid was unsuccessful in this endeavour, and was eventually forced into exile in Yemen. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the Arabian Peninsula with a band of Hadhrami musketeers and a group of devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to overpower the local Hawiye clans and establish the Kingdom of Hobyo in 1878.Lee V. Cassanelli, The shaping of Somali society: reconstructing the history of a pastoral people, 1600-1900, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p.75. Ruins of a Majeerteen Sultanate castle in Bargal As with the Majeerteen Sultanate, the Sultanate of Hobyo exerted a strong centralized authority during its existence, and possessed all of the organs and trappings of an integrated modern state: a functioning bureaucracy, a hereditary nobility, titled aristocrats, a state flag, as well as a professional army.Michigan State University. African Studies Center, Northeast African studies, Volumes 11-12, (Michigan State University Press: 1989), p.32. Both sultanates also maintained written records of their activities, which still exist. In late 1889, Boqor Osman entered into a treaty with the Italians, making his realm an Italian protectorate. His rival Sultan Kenadid had signed a similar agreement vis-a- vis his own Sultanate the year before. Both rulers had signed the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist objectives, with Boqor Osman looking to use Italy's support in his ongoing power struggle with Kenadid over the Majeerteen Sultanate. Boqor Osman and Sultan Kenadid also hoped to exploit the conflicting interests among the European imperial powers that were then looking to control the Somali peninsula, so as to avoid direct occupation of their territories by force.The Majeerteen Sultanates The relationship between the Sultanate of Hobyo and Italy soured when Sultan Kenadid refused the Italians' proposal to allow a British contingent of troops to disembark in his Sultanate so that they might then pursue their battle against the Somali religious and nationalist leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's Dervish forces. Viewed as too much of a threat by the Italians, Sultan Kenadid was eventually exiled to Aden in Yemen and then to Eritrea, as was his son Ali Yusuf, the heir apparent to his throne. Osman Yusuf Kenadid, the son of the first Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid, was a famous poet and scholar. Osman Yusuf Kenadid was the inventor of the first phonetically standard script for the Somali language in the 1920s, the Osmanya Script.

The archaeologists noted that they thought the same thing that attracts visitors to the park today, the waterfall, also attracted Native Americans to the site. Remnants of the gristmill, distillery and oil well were also found by the team from the university. Geology Extended systems of underwater caves, sinkholes and springs are found throughout Florida. The limestone is topped with sandy soils deposited as ancient beaches over millions of years as global sea levels rose and fell. During the last glacial period, lower sea levels and a drier climate revealed a much wider peninsula, largely savanna. Falling Waters State Park lies atop a bed of limestone that has been eroded over the years by water which has created the sinkholes and caverns that are found throughout the park. The waterfalls of Falling Waters State Park fall into a sinkhole known as Falling Waters Sink. The waterfalls are fed by springs that are dependent on rainfall. The water from the falls disappears into a large cavern at the base of the sinkhole. The sinkhole can be accessed by visitors by way of a paved trail and boardwalk. Recreation Falling Water State Park is open for year-round recreation including camping, fishing, hiking and swimming. The park is noted for hosting campfire circles. Park rangers give interpretive talks at the circles and present a slide show. The main campground is on one of the highest hills in Florida at . It has twenty-four sites that are equipped with electricity, fresh water, picnic tables and grills and a clothesline. Swimming and fishing are permitted in the lake.

Initially gaining recognition amongst the Auden Group as a highly imaginative surrealist writer, in the 1930s he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, after which his writing shifted towards Marxist realism. His literary career spanned over eighty years. Early life and education Upward was born on 9 September 1903 in Romford, Essex, where his father had a doctor's surgery. His parents were Harold Arthur Upward (1874‚Äì1958), who came from a middle class family on the Isle of Wight, and Louisa \\"Isa\\" Upward (n√©e Jones; 1869‚Äì1951), who had trained as a nurse and tried acting. His mother, who had grown up in Wanstead but was of Welsh descent, came from a lower middle class background but was very class conscious, a trait Upward strongly disliked. His siblings were John Mervyn Upward (1905‚Äì1999); Laurence Vaughan Upward (1909‚Äì1970), who suffered from schizophrenia;Edward Upward and Left-Wing Literary Culture in Britain, Benjamin Kohlmann et al, 2013 and Yolande Isa Upward (1911‚Äì2004). Another brother, Harold, was born in 1907 and died in infancy that same year. His first cousin once removed was the poet and novelist Allen Upward, who committed suicide in 1926. In 1917, at the insistence of his mother, Upward was sent to Repton School, where he became a close friend of Christopher Isherwood in the sixth form. Upward's first published material appeared in the school magazine, The Reptonian, in February 1920. From 1922 to 1925 he attended Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, reading History and then English. After the arrival of Isherwood in Cambridge in 1923 the two created the surreal town of Mortmere, an obscene parody and repudiation of the various upper-class characters they encountered at the university. Upward was awarded Cambridge's Chancellor's Medal for English Verse in 1924, for his poem \\"Buddha\\". Through Isherwood Upward met and befriended W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender; his first meeting with Auden was at a caf√© in Soho in 1927. Teaching and communist activities From January 1926 Upward took up various teaching jobs in a number of locations, such as Carbis Bay, Worcester, Lockerbie, Scarborough and Stowe. In 1932 he became an English master at Alleyn's School, Dulwich, having been recommended by a friend of his brother, Mer, who was also a schoolmaster and became headmaster of Port Regis School the following year. He remained at Alleyn's until his retirement in 1961. In 1931 he began attending meetings of a branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain in Bethnal Green, and canvassed for Joe Vaughan, the CPGB candidate for Bethnal Green South West in that year's general election. In 1932 he joined the party on a probationary basis, which was partly self-imposed, and travelled to the Soviet Union as part of a delegation that also included Barbara Wootton. He also visited Isherwood and Spender in Berlin. He became a full member of the party in 1934. In 1936 he married Hilda Percival (1909‚Äì1995), a fellow teacher and CPGB member, with whom he had a son and a daughter (their son, Christopher Upward, became a linguist). During the Second World War the family was evacuated with Upward's school to Cleveleys in Lancashire, where Alleyn's temporarily merged with the nearby Rossall School. Starting in 1942 Upward and his wife began to be investigated by MI5 in relation to their communist activities.Stansky, P., Edward Upward: Art and Life, p. 160 Upward remained committed to internationalism and socialism for the rest of his life, although he and Hilda left the CPGB in 1948, believing that it was no longer revolutionary and that its leadership was trying to appease the Labour government. Upward c. 1972 Upward's first novel, Journey to the Border, was published by the Hogarth Press in 1938. It describes in poetic prose the rebellion of a private tutor against his employer and the menacing world of the 1930s, inducing a nightmarish state, and concluding with the recognition that he must join the workers' movement. After this, Upward found it increasingly difficult to write anything, and so in 1952‚Äì53 he took a sabbatical year from teaching in order to focus more intently on his writing, but this backfired and resulted in a nervous breakdown. During this time he destroyed most of his Mortmere stories from his Cambridge days, having concluded that such grotesque and fantastical fiction was inappropriate in a post-Holocaust world. In 1954 Upward began to overcome his creative block and started work on an autobiographical trilogy titled The Spiral Ascent, dealing with the struggle of a poet, Alan Sebrill, to combine his creative endeavours with political commitment to the CPGB. The trilogy was published in the years following Upward's early retirement in 1961 to the house where his parents used to live in Sandown, Isle of Wight. In the Thirties (1962), the first volume, describes Sebrill's early involvement with the CPGB and the struggle against the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. The Rotten Elements (1969) involves Sebrill and his wife's clash with the party leadership, and their decision to leave the party. The final volume, No Home but the Struggle (1977), sees Sebrill find new meaning by joining the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which helps him to write again. It also includes largely autobiographical recollections of Upward‚Äôs family and childhood, inspired by Marcel Proust, whom Upward greatly admired. Later years In the last decades of the twentieth century Upward returned to writing short stories, which were published, along with reprints of earlier works, by the Enitharmon Press. His last years were also punctuated by sadness, with the deaths of his wife Hilda, in 1995, and his son Christopher, in 2002. In 2003 Enitharmon celebrated his centenary by publishing selected short stories, edited by Alan Walker, as A Renegade in Springtime. He often gave interviews recalling memories of his famous friends. In an interview with Nicholas Wroe, which appeared in The Guardian the month before his hundredth birthday, Upward explained that the title \\"came from an idea for a story about Auden. I never wrote the story, but the phrase stayed. The renegade is the one with a sense of reality and everyone else is too happy-go-lucky.\\" His last story, \\"Crommelin-Brown\\", was written in 2003, shortly before he turned 100. In 2005 Upward was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and awarded its Benson Medal. On 13 February 2009 Upward died of a chest infection at a care home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, where he had relocated in 2004 to be close to his daughter. He was 105 years old. Edward Upward: Art and Life by Peter Stansky was published in May 2016. There are collections of Upward's literary papers and correspondence in the British Library (Add MS 89002) and in the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.

The first few days following the assassinations included a number of key events that shaped the subsequent course of the genocide. These included: the seizing of power by an interim government directed by the hard-line Akazu clique; the liquidation of opposition Hutu politicians; the implementation of plans to carry out a genocide throughout the country; and the murder of United Nations peacekeepers, contributing to the impulse of the international community to refrain from intervention.  The crisis committee meets (6th)  :For details of the assassination and events in the minutes immediately afterward, see Assassination of Juv√©nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira. At approximately 8:20 pm on April 6, 1994, the plane carrying Rwandan President Juv√©nal Habyarimana, Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) Chief of Staff Deogratias Nsabimana, and other prominent figures was shot down while approaching Kigali International Airport. Defence Minister Augustin Bizimana was in Cameroon attending a meeting, along with Col. Aloys Ntiwiragabo, head of army intelligence, G-2. Approximately one and a half to two hours after the crash, the officers at army headquarters in Kigali realized that they had to decide whom to appoint the new army chief of staff and somberly gathered in a meeting room. Soon after Col. Th√©oneste Bagosora, director of the office of the minister of defence, arrived and stated that it was his responsibility to chair the meeting. Bagosora had a poor reputation as a military man, having received his appointment due to his political connections in the governing MRND party. One colonel suggested that Major-General Augustin Ndindiliyimana, chief of the staff of the National Gendarmerie, would be a more appropriate choice, but Ndindiliyimana declined to take responsibility, to the astonishment of some officers.Linda Melvern, Conspiracy to Murder: The Rwandan Genocide, Verso: New York, 2004, , p. 137 There was widespread fear of a power vacuum. Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana was next in the line of political succession but most officers believed that she was not capable of governing; Bagosora dismissed the option of putting themselves under the authority of Uwiligiyimana. There was discussion about abiding by the Arusha Accords, but this would require consulting with the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front on the next steps. Bagosora suggested that the military should take over, but received the support of only one officer, Lt-Col Cyprien Kayumba, director of Defense Ministry financial services. Most officers were desperate to avoid the impression of a coup d'√©tat. Someone commented that the Accords were still in effect and the United Nations remained in the country. The officers agreed to contact the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) and invite General Rom√©o Dallaire, UNAMIR Force Commander, to the meeting to show that a coup was not being carried out.Melvern (2004), pp. 137-138 Assassination of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana and moderate Hutus During the nighttime from 6 April to 7 April, the members of the Forces arm√©es rwandaises, under the leadership of Bagosora, engaged in heated discourse with General Rom√©o Dallaire, then commander of the UNAMIR. UNAMIR served as the military and legal force behind the Prime Minister of Rwanda, in addition to its other peacekeeping duties. Madame Agathe Uwiligiyimana, the Rwandan Prime Minister, planned to launch an appeal for calm over the radio the following morning. General Dallaire sent an armed escort of five Ghanaian and ten Belgian peacekeepers to Uwiligiyimana to accompany her to the radio station. However, the presidential guard took control of the state radio station that morning and Madame Uwilingyimana had to cancel her speech. Later that day, the presidential guard assassinated her along with 10 Belgian UNAMIR peacekeepers. At 9:00 p.m., Dallaire learned that Belgians had been killed and Ghanaians brought to safety by Hutu forces. Many powerful moderate Hutus who favored the Arusha Accords were later assassinated. An attempt was made on the life of Faustin Twagiramungu, the prime minister of the Transitional Broad Based Government under the accords, but it failed thanks to the efforts of the UNAMIR.  Execution of Belgian peacekeepers  Memorial for the dead Belgian UNAMIR personnel in Kigali. The presidential guard captured the fifteen UN peacekeeping troops from UNAMIR, who had been protecting the country's prime minister, Madame Uwilingiyimana. Five out of the fifteen were Ghanaian soldiers who were quickly set free. The other ten were Belgians from the Paracommando Brigade, and were tortured and hacked to death with machetes.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/etc/script.html Major Bernard Ntuyahaga was convicted of the Belgians' murders in 2007. In his book, Me Against My Brother, Scott Peterson describes the barbaric reported details of their murders: > Their Achilles tendons were cut so they couldn't run, and the Belgian > soldiers were castrated and died choking on their genitalia.*Peterson, Scot. > Me Against My Brother: At War in Somalia, Sudan, and Rwanda: A Journalist > Reports from the Battlefields of Africa.

The 13th > Anniversary of The Rwandan Genocides , Friday, April 6, 2007 Bagosora and his entourage immediately advised General Dallaire that it was better for the Belgians to leave immediately because the radio accused them of being the perpetrators behind the attack on the presidential airplane. These accusations had aroused the uncontrollable anger of the group. Earlier in the year, General Dallaire had been told by an informer named \\"Jean-Pierre\\" in January 1994 that there was a plan to attack the Belgians in order to make them leave the UNAMIR, where they formed the largest contingent of soldiers. The names of the peacekeepers who died are:http://www.cdomuseum.be/ANGLAIS/09_uk.htm * Lt. Thierry Lottin * 1Sgt. Yannick Leroy * Cpl. Bruno Bassinne * Cpl. Stephane Lhoir * Cpl. Bruno Meaux * Cpl.

Alain Debatty Evacuation of foreign personnel by Belgium and France France and Belgium formed two separate militarily assisted evacuation operations whose actions are detailed in the role of the international community section. France also evacuated dignitaries, families of Habyarimana regime officials, and the children in a presidential orphanage. These evacuations were the cause of two very large controversies, after the fact. The first is over whether the genocide could have been stopped at the outset by nearby Western troops. At the time, there were American soldiers in Burundi, two hundred kilometres south of Kigali. Larger groups of Western troops were also a few hours from Rwanda by aeroplane. Soldiers agree that these troops had the power to retake control of Kigali and to decisively support UNAMIR, which had a lamentable lack of equipment. The other controversy related to the complete refusal to evacuate the endangered Tutsi. The only Western country which evacuated any Tutsi was Belgium; these were a very few Tutsi who had succeeded in including themselves into the evacuated groups by negotiation or infiltration. Composition of the interim government The new government was created after the assassination of the Prime Minister, Madame Uwilingiyimana. Its prime minister was the first to be condemned by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda: Jean Kambanda, who pleaded guilty. Read sub-chapters 14.4 to 14.8 of the United Nations report. This government was characterized as controlling the genocide. The ICTR has sentenced or is in the process of sentencing the majority of its members. It seems that there was a fight for influence between Colonel Bagosora, who controlled the presidential guard, and the chief of staff of the FAR who wished to create a civil government. This government was thus the result of a trade-off of circumstances and Bagosora, who renounced a military government, \\"set up‚Äù (according to the terms of the agreement with the UN) a civil government formed of adept members of the Hutu Power, motivated by the extermination of the Tutsi. Civil war starts again between the RGF and the RPF In 1993, the Arusha peace Accords established Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) and Rwandese Government Forces (RGF) sectors within Kigali, leaving a demilitarized zone between the two. Each side was supposed to work towards disarming after the Broad-Based Transitional Government (BBTG) was established, setting the stage for democracy and healing after the recent civil wars. The RGF was closely affiliated with the Presidential Guard and the Gendarmes (national police force of Rwanda), and loyal to the Rwandan president Habyarimana (a Hutu). Other Hutu power extremist groups aligned themselves with the RGF (including the MRND, the president's own Hutu power extremist political party). On the opposite side, the RPF was viewed by the RGF and affiliated groups as trying to take control of Rwanda with only Tutsi interests in mind, shutting out the Hutus in an attempt to return to colonial times when the Tutsis were the ruling class. Caught in the middle were moderates trying to weave the fragile peace tighter together. April 6, 1994, was the start of the civil war and ensuing genocide. That evening, the Rwandan president Major General Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was shot down over the Kigali airport. Also on board was Cyprien Ntaryamira, the president of Burundi, and Deogratias Nsabimana, the chief of staff of the army. There were no survivors. The RGF immediately blamed the RPF for the assassination, and that very night the fragile peace accords shattered. The Presidential Guard immediately set out on well planned missions to assassinate all moderate Hutus and every last Tutsi, starting with those affiliated with the now destroyed Arusha Accords and the BBTG. They began their mission literally after the plane crash, wasting no time. When April 7 dawned, the country was already deep in bloodshed. After the plane crash, UNAMIR found themselves spread thinly throughout the city, with their mandate now up in the air. They did not have enough forces to provide security for those now under attack, and were told by the United Nations to not fire unless fired upon. Civilians poured into the UN areas seeking protection, to find no food, running water, or electricity, the last two being severed very rapidly after the assassination of President Habyarimana. UNAMIR had little guidance as far as how they were to treat the civilians, and to what extent protection could be provided. Added to this were dozens of government employees and those in former positions of power who immediately realized they were in grave danger. Calls to UNAMIR for protection came faster than UNAMIR could respond, and traveling through Kigali to rescue people was not only highly dangerous, but impossible in many circumstances. Lack of vehicles, lack of secure communication, lack of gasoline, and lack of troops crippled the rescue efforts. On April 7, it was decided that Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister of the interim government and someone who worked vigilantly towards establishing the BBTG, should give a speech to the populace calling for calm. Radio Rwanda was the chosen, government controlled radio station, but she was denied access and assassinated shortly thereafter. With Madame Agathe murdered and the government controlled radio station off limits, there was no one to calm the civilians. Misinformation and hate speech began to fill the radio waves from the independent station, RTLM. RTLM immediately blamed Belgian peacekeepers and the RPF for the President's plane crash, asking for the population to rise up and kill the peace keepers and all Tutsi 'cockroaches'. Fear and hate, already deeply rooted within the country, was further spread at lightning speed, leaving UNAMIR powerless to stop the broadcasts despite pleas to the RGF to cease transmissions. The RPF (Rwandese Patriotic Front) became the only force capable of stopping the Presidential Guard (along with the Gendarmes and Interahamwe - Kinyarwanda for 'those who attack together') who were setting up roadblocks throughout Kigali and starting the process of slaughtering Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Interahamwe were composed of local citizens, driven to extreme hate against the Tutsis, and were very difficult to control due to their close ties to the local communities and alliance with the RGF. UNAMIR's hands were tied. So the RPF, now out of options, launched major offenses against the RGF, with the RGF returning fire. The RGF leadership disavowed any connection with the 'rogue' gangs committing the killings, though the RGF leader, Colonel Th√©oneste Bagosora, was later convicted of being a key orchestrator of the genocide. With all diplomatic ties severed, the only way to end the slaughter was to battle the RGF and wrestle control away from the Hutu extremist groups. The RPF were also guilty of bloodshed; some Hutu extremists who were thought, or known, to have killed innocent civilians were killed by the RPF, although not nearly to the extent of the 800,000 murdered Tutsis. The fighting which began late on the evening of April 6 did not end for another hundred days, leaving hundreds of thousands dead, missing, and displaced.

Originally built as a Norwegian fisheries research and enforcement vessel, she was purchased by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in Edinburgh, Scotland, in August 1996. Originally named Sea Shepherd III, the name was changed in 1999 to Ocean Warrior, before eventually being renamed in 2002 after Canadian writer Farley Mowat. She was the flagship of Sea Shepherd's fleet until seized by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans off the coast of Newfoundland in April 2008. She was sold for C$5,000 by court order in November 2009 to Green Ship LLC, a company headquartered in Oregon. During 2010, she was moored in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, undergoing refit for operation as an expedition vessel for research in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, by 2011, the ship was on the market again to cover unpaid docking fees and was eventually sold in March 2013. The vessel, stripped of her superstructure having been purchased for scrap, sank at her berth at Shelburne, Nova Scotia in June 2015 and was subsequently raised. The vessel remained laid up at Shelburne until July 2017, when the hulk was taken away to be broken up.  Career  The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society used the vessel to monitor international waters for violations of international fisheries agreements. Farley Mowat officially began her career in the waters off Costa Rica, immersed in controversy over policing actions against illegal fishing activities. In March and April 2008, Farley Mowat was involved in controversy related to the 2008 Canadian commercial seal hunt. On 12 April 2008, Fisheries and Oceans Canada seized Farley Mowat in the Cabot Strait after the ship came near the seal hunt without an observation permit and two collisions with a coast guard vessel occurred. During the raid, the captain and first officer were arrested and later charged for the incident. While seized, Farley Mowat was held by Fisheries and Oceans Canada at Sydney, Nova Scotia until put up for sale. The location of the ship at the time of the seizure is controversial. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society claims the ship was seized illegally in international waters. The Canadian Fisheries minister claims that the ship was seized in Canadian waters, but also that the Fisheries Act gave him authority to order the boarding outside Canada's territorial waters zone of . The captain and first officer made a court appearance on 1 May 2008. On 2 July 2008, they entered a plea of not guilty to coming too close to sealers. Convicted in absentia in June 2009 on two counts each of approaching within of a seal hunt, the pair were sentenced on 10 September 2009 to fines totaling C$45,000. MV Fundy Paradise, CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent, RV Farley Mowat, Sydport Nova Scotia, March 2009 On 27 February 2009, the Canadian Crown-in- Council announced that Farley Mowat was being put up for sale to cover approximately C$500,000 in berthing fees accrued since the April 2008 seizure. Subsequently, Farley Mowat was reportedly sold for C$50,000, but the buyer did not complete the transaction. As of September 2009 the ship was still in the possession of the Canadian government and continued to accrue berthing fees. Sea Shepherd later stated that the seizure of the ship had been expected and, in fact, encouraged. Therefore, she had been used in provocation, with the full intention to have the Canadian government end up with, in their opinion, a more or less worthless vessel. Farley Mowat arrived in Halifax on 18 December 2009 for refit and was towed to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia where she was tied up . It was reported in November 2009 that the vessel has been sold for the sum of C$5,000 to the Green Ship LLC subsidiary of Stephen Munson's organization Tenthmil to be used in a survey of the North Pacific Gyre. , Farley Mowat remained berthed in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia for a refit under the direction of Cliff Hodder. In early 2013, with unpaid docking fees on the order of C$90,000 and Green Ship LLC apparently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the ship was sold at a sheriff's auction to an undisclosed buyer. The buyer was later identified as Tracy Dodds of Eastern Scrap and Demolition Services, a Halifax-based company; the purchase price was C$9,200. The vessel sat in Lunenburg for several months, during which the superstructure was removed, before being evicted by the Lunenburg Waterfront Development Corporation for non-payment of docking fees. In early September 2013, Farley Mowat was towed to Shelburne, Nova Scotia, on the way to Meteghan, Nova Scotia, where she would be scrapped. On 24 June 2015, Farley Mowat sank at her berth and came to rest on the bottom of the harbour. The vessel was subsequently refloated and of pollutants were removed, with the Canadian Coast Guard incurring costs of some C$815,000. Owner Tracy Dodds was found to be in contempt of court for failing to remove the vessel or pay C$10,000 in penalties and fees. On 3 August 2016, Dodds was arrested in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on contempt charges and subsequently served 20 days in jail. As of 29 December 2016, Farley Mowat hulk remained docked in Shelburne, with over C$130,000 in docking fees owing. In June 2017, the Canadian Coast Guard informed Shelburne city staff that the vessel would be removed in the following weeks to be broken up. On 26 July 2017, the hulk was towed away by Atlantic Towing under contract from the Canadian Coast Guard to be broken up at Liverpool, Nova Scotia.  Registration  Farley Mowat registered under the Canadian flag in April 2002. In October of the same year, the government suspended her registration. The complete record of registration is unclear, but the latest record under Canadian Vessel Registration Query System is closing on 20 November 2006. The United Kingdom revoked the ship's registration in early December 2006; the same day it was issued. Sea Shepherd then received registration for her in Belize on 19 December 2006. Ten days later, on 29 December 2006, Farley Mowat cleared Australian Customs in Hobart, Tasmania, only hours before Belize struck her flag. During 2007, the ship operated without an officially recognised registration flag. In May 2007, Sea Shepherd issued a press release stating that the Mohawk long house of the Iroquois Confederacy, in response to the Canadian government action, had agreed to the ship (and Sea Shepherd's other ship Robert Hunter) flying their flag. It was not clear if this was recognised as a registration by port authorities as the body is not internationally recognised as a country. The vessel was registered in the Netherlands in 2008.  Successor  In January 2015, Sea Shepherd USA purchased two recently decommissioned U.S. Coast Guard Island-class patrol boats, one of which has been christened the MY Farley Mowat.

They are typically the fourth type of roadway classified below the Interstate Highway, the U.S. Route numbered highway and the state highway. The County Route system is defined by two types in New Jersey. First, 500 Series County Routes, also called state secondary routes (to the state highway), are county highways numbered in a statewide system with three-digit numbers that begin with 5. These roads form a second network of routes that supplement the facilitation of the State Routes. Each 500 Series route is unique and is not permitted to be duplicated in another county for a separate route. The second category is defined as Non-500 Series County Routes. Non-500 Series County Routes include 1-digit, 2-digit, 600 Series, 700 Series and 800 Series. These, by definition, are discontinuous across county borders and must be contained entirely within that county. Unlike 500 Series County routes, these route numbers are unique to each county, and are typically assigned to more local routes than the statewide 500-series county route system. They are typically of a lesser classification of streets like minor arterials or collector roadways rather than major arterials or thoroughfares. In the counties that use 600-series numbers, the selection of this range was coordinated within the state, gradually replacing older systems of mainly one- and two-digit routes.Historical Maps of New Jersey With very rare exceptions (such as County Route 537), the 500 series follows the rule of cardinal direction used for Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes: even-numbered roads run east and west, while odd-numbered roads run north and south. East-west routes tend to be numbered with the lowest numbers in the northern part of the state and the highest numbers in the southern part of the state, also like the U.S. Routes. In northern New Jersey, north-south routes range from CR 501 in the east to CR 521 in the west, although numbering in the southern part of the state tends to be more haphazard. County route numbers have not wholly replaced the preexisting names of the local roads to which they were assigned. Street signs at major intersections will denote both the local road name and the county route number if it has one. Residents who live along county routes rarely, if ever, give their address as \\"123 County Route 5xx\\" unless no name for the route has been established, as is the case in some rural areas. History of the 500-series { \\"type\\": \\"ExternalData\\", \\"service\\": \\"page\\", \\"title\\": \\"Bergen County 200 Series County Routes.map\\", } The precursor to the 500 series was a group of three roads in Bergen County which received the numbers 200, 201, and 203 in the late 1930s. 200 ran from Oakland to Alpine; 201 ran from Ridgewood to Alpine; and 203 ran from Weehawken to Alpine. US 202 runs through Bergen County, thus the planners skipped this number. In February 1942, a group of civil defense routes was assigned with numbers in the 500s in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. These roads were designed as through routes for civilian use in case the state highway system was needed by the military during World War II operations. These routes were numbered in relation to existing routes. For example, Civil Route 501 ran parallel to US 1 and Civil Route 532 was an extension of NY 32 into New Jersey. The current series of roads in the 500s was established by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) in 1952. Some of the roads had spurs or alternate routes established; about one-third of these survive today even though such designations were eliminated from the primary state system in the 1953 New Jersey State Highway renumbering. (The others have become 600-series county routes as described below.) Other county routes Camden County, marked with an older square shield design Middlesex County's pre-600-series numbering Most counties in New Jersey follow the 500-series county routes with their own county routes numbered otherwise, typically in the 600-series. Only two counties - Bergen CountyNJDOT Straight-line diagrams table of contents for Bergen County and Monmouth CountyNJDOT Straight-line diagrams table of contents for Monmouth County - have not adopted 600-series numbers. Ocean CountyNJDOT Straight-line diagrams table of contents for Ocean County also has a number of minor one- and two-digit routes in addition to their 600-series routes. While the majority of New Jersey's counties put signs on their 600 (or secondary) routes, Hudson County apparently doesn't sign any of them, and Ocean County has chosen to sporadically sign them. The only 600 signage to appear in Ocean County has been put up as a result of recent construction projects, which can cause confusion for those not familiar with the area. In some counties, the 600-series numbers can break into the 700s and even 800s.

It is a Baroque palace on the hilly bank of the Dnipro River. History The Maryinsky Palace as it appeared in 1918 whilst serving as the tsar's Kyiv residence The palace was ordered to be constructed in 1744 by the Russian Empress Elizaveta Petrovna, and was designed by Bartolomeo Rastrelli, the most famous architect working in the Russian Empire at that time. One of the students of Rastrelli, Ivan Michurin, together with a group of other architects, completed the palace in 1752. Empress Elizabeth, however, did not live long enough to see the palace. The first royal figure to stay in the palace was Empress Catherine II, who visited Kyiv in 1787. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the palace was the main residence of Governors-General. In the early 19th century, the palace burned down in a series of fires, and was in total disrepair and abandoned for almost half a century. In 1870, Alexander II of Russia had the palace reconstructed by the architect Konstantin Mayevsky, using old drawings and watercolours as guide. It was then renamed after the reigning Empress Maria Alexandrovna. By her wish, a large park was established off the southern side of the palace. The palace was used as a residence for visiting members of the imperial family until 1917. During the years of the Russian Civil War in 1917-20, the palace was used as the Kyiv revkom headquarters, particularly during the Kyiv Bolshevik Uprising. In the 1920s the building belonged to an agricultural school, soon after which it became a museum. The Mariyinsky was badly damaged in World War II, and restored at the end of the 1940s. Another major restoration was completed in the early 1980s.  Presidential Standard  presidential standard is flown at the Maryinsky Palace Whilst the presidential standard was not typically flown above the residence of the Ukrainian president, it has become increasingly common, in recent years, for the standard to be raised above the Maryinsky Palace - particularly when the president is in residence or hosting other heads of state. This change in protocol has brought Ukraine more into line with other European nations, in which it is common practice to fly the head of state's standard as a symbol of the authority of their office.

An excavator; main hydraulics: Boom cylinders, swingdrive, cooler fan and trackdrive Fundamental features of using hydraulics compared to mechanics for force and torque increase/decrease in a transmission. Hydraulic machines use liquid fluid power to perform work. Heavy construction vehicles are a common example. In this type of machine, hydraulic fluid is pumped to various hydraulic motors and hydraulic cylinders throughout the machine and becomes pressurized according to the resistance present. The fluid is controlled directly or automatically by control valves and distributed through hoses, tubes, and/or pipes. Hydraulic systems, like pneumatic systems, are based on Pascal's law which states that any pressure applied to a fluid inside a closed system will transmit that pressure equally everywhere and in all directions. A hydraulic system uses an in-compressible liquid as its fluid, rather than a compressible gas. The popularity of hydraulic machinery is due to the very large amount of power that can be transferred through small tubes and flexible hoses, and the high power density and wide array of actuators that can make use of this power, and the huge multiplication of forces that can be achieved by applying pressures over relatively large areas. One drawback, compared to machines using gears and shafts, is that any transmission of power results in some losses due to resistance of fluid flow through the piping. History Joseph Bramah patented the hydraulic press in 1795. While working at Bramah's shop, Henry Maudslay suggested a cup leather packing. Because it produced superior results, the hydraulic press eventually displaced the steam hammer for metal forging. To supply large scale power that was impractical for individual steam engines, central station hydraulic systems were developed. Hydraulic power was used to operate cranes and other machinery in British ports and elsewhere in Europe. The largest hydraulic system was in London. Hydraulic power was used extensively in Bessemer steel production. Hydraulic power was also used for elevators, to operate canal locks and rotating sections of bridges. Some of these systems remained in use well into the twentieth century. Harry Franklin Vickers was called the \\"Father of Industrial Hydraulics\\" by ASME. Force and torque multiplication A fundamental feature of hydraulic systems is the ability to apply force or torque multiplication in an easy way, independent of the distance between the input and output, without the need for mechanical gears or levers, either by altering the effective areas in two connected cylinders or the effective displacement (cc/rev) between a pump and motor. In normal cases, hydraulic ratios are combined with a mechanical force or torque ratio for optimum machine designs such as boom movements and trackdrives for an excavator. ;Examples ;;Two hydraulic cylinders interconnected: Cylinder C1 is one inch in radius, and cylinder C2 is ten inches in radius. If the force exerted on C1 is 10 lbf, the force exerted by C2 is 1000 lbf because C2 is a hundred times larger in area (S = œÄr¬≤) as C1. The downside to this is that you have to move C1 a hundred inches to move C2 one inch. The most common use for this is the classical hydraulic jack where a pumping cylinder with a small diameter is connected to the lifting cylinder with a large diameter. ;;Pump and motor: If a hydraulic rotary pump with the displacement 10 cc/rev is connected to a hydraulic rotary motor with 100 cc/rev, the shaft torque required to drive the pump is one tenth of the torque then available at the motor shaft, but the shaft speed (rev/min) for the motor is also only one tenth of the pump shaft speed. This combination is actually the same type of force multiplication as the cylinder example, just that the linear force in this case is a rotary force, defined as torque. Both these examples are usually referred to as a hydraulic transmission or hydrostatic transmission involving a certain hydraulic \\"gear ratio\\". Hydraulic circuits A hydraulic circuit is a system comprising an interconnected set of discrete components that transport liquid. The purpose of this system may be to control where fluid flows (as in a network of tubes of coolant in a thermodynamic system) or to control fluid pressure (as in hydraulic amplifiers). For example, hydraulic machinery uses hydraulic circuits (in which hydraulic fluid is pushed, under pressure, through hydraulic pumps, pipes, tubes, hoses, hydraulic motors, hydraulic cylinders, and so on) to move heavy loads. The approach of describing a fluid system in terms of discrete components is inspired by the success of electrical circuit theory. Just as electric circuit theory works when elements are discrete and linear, hydraulic circuit theory works best when the elements (passive component such as pipes or transmission lines or active components such as power packs or pumps) are discrete and linear. This usually means that hydraulic circuit analysis works best for long, thin tubes with discrete pumps, as found in chemical process flow systems or microscale devices. The circuit comprises the following components: * Active components ** Hydraulic power pack * Transmission lines ** Hydraulic hoses * Passive components ** Hydraulic cylinders For the hydraulic fluid to do work, it must flow to the actuator and/or motors, then return to a reservoir. The fluid is then filtered and re-pumped. The path taken by hydraulic fluid is called a hydraulic circuit of which there are several types. * Open center circuits use pumps which supply a continuous flow. The flow is returned to tank through the control valve's open center; that is, when the control valve is centered, it provides an open return path to tank and the fluid is not pumped to a high pressure. Otherwise, if the control valve is actuated it routes fluid to and from an actuator and tank. The fluid's pressure will rise to meet any resistance, since the pump has a constant output. If the pressure rises too high, fluid returns to tank through a pressure relief valve. Multiple control valves may be stacked in series . This type of circuit can use inexpensive, constant displacement pumps. * Closed center circuits supply full pressure to the control valves, whether any valves are actuated or not. The pumps vary their flow rate, pumping very little hydraulic fluid until the operator actuates a valve. The valve's spool therefore doesn't need an open center return path to tank. Multiple valves can be connected in a parallel arrangement and system pressure is equal for all valves. Open loop and closed loop circuits = Open loop circuits = Open-loop: Pump-inlet and motor- return (via the directional valve) are connected to the hydraulic tank. The term loop applies to feedback; the more correct term is open versus closed \\"circuit\\". Open center circuits use pumps which supply a continuous flow. The flow is returned to the tank through the control valve's open center; that is, when the control valve is centered, it provides an open return path to the tank and the fluid is not pumped to a high pressure. Otherwise, if the control valve is actuated it routes fluid to and from an actuator and tank. The fluid's pressure will rise to meet any resistance, since the pump has a constant output. If the pressure rises too high, fluid returns to the tank through a pressure relief valve. Multiple control valves may be stacked in series. This type of circuit can use inexpensive, constant displacement pumps. = Closed loop circuits = Closed-loop: Motor-return is connected directly to the pump-inlet. To keep up pressure on the low pressure side, the circuits have a charge pump (a small gearpump) that supplies cooled and filtered oil to the low pressure side. Closed-loop circuits are generally used for hydrostatic transmissions in mobile applications. Advantages: No directional valve and better response, the circuit can work with higher pressure. The pump swivel angle covers both positive and negative flow direction. Disadvantages: The pump cannot be utilized for any other hydraulic function in an easy way and cooling can be a problem due to limited exchange of oil flow. High power closed loop systems generally must have a 'flush-valve' assembled in the circuit in order to exchange much more flow than the basic leakage flow from the pump and the motor, for increased cooling and filtering. The flush valve is normally integrated in the motor housing to get a cooling effect for the oil that is rotating in the motor housing itself. The losses in the motor housing from rotating effects and losses in the ball bearings can be considerable as motor speeds will reach 4000-5000 rev/min or even more at maximum vehicle speed. The leakage flow as well as the extra flush flow must be supplied by the charge pump. A large charge pump is thus very important if the transmission is designed for high pressures and high motor speeds. High oil temperature is usually a major problem when using hydrostatic transmissions at high vehicle speeds for longer periods, for instance when transporting the machine from one work place to the other. High oil temperatures for long periods will drastically reduce the lifetime of the transmission. To keep down the oil temperature, the system pressure during transport must be lowered, meaning that the minimum displacement for the motor must be limited to a reasonable value. Circuit pressure during transport around 200-250 bar is recommended. Closed loop systems in mobile equipment are generally used for the transmission as an alternative to mechanical and hydrodynamic (converter) transmissions. The advantage is a stepless gear ratio (continuously variable speed/torque) and a more flexible control of the gear ratio depending on the load and operating conditions. The hydrostatic transmission is generally limited to around 200 kW maximum power, as the total cost gets too high at higher power compared to a hydrodynamic transmission. Large wheel loaders for instance and heavy machines are therefore usually equipped with converter transmissions. Recent technical achievements for the converter transmissions have improved the efficiency and developments in the software have also improved the characteristics, for example selectable gear shifting programs during operation and more gear steps, giving them characteristics close to the hydrostatic transmission. Constant pressure and load-sensing systems Hydrostatic transmissions for earth moving machines, such as for track loaders, are often equipped with a separate 'inch pedal' that is used to temporarily increase the diesel engine rpm while reducing the vehicle speed in order to increase the available hydraulic power output for the working hydraulics at low speeds and increase the tractive effort. The function is similar to stalling a converter gearbox at high engine rpm. The inch function affects the preset characteristics for the 'hydrostatic' gear ratio versus diesel engine rpm. = Constant pressure (CP) systems = The closed center circuits exist in two basic configurations, normally related to the regulator for the variable pump that supplies the oil: * Constant pressure systems (CP-system), standard. Pump pressure always equals the pressure setting for the pump regulator. This setting must cover the maximum required load pressure. Pump delivers flow according to required sum of flow to the consumers. The CP-system generates large power losses if the machine works with large variations in load pressure and the average system pressure is much lower than the pressure setting for the pump regulator. CP is simple in design, and works like a pneumatic system. New hydraulic functions can easily be added and the system is quick in response. * Constant pressure systems (CP- system), unloaded. Same basic configuration as 'standard' CP-system but the pump is unloaded to a low stand-by pressure when all valves are in neutral position. Not so fast response as standard CP but pump lifetime is prolonged. = Load-sensing (LS) systems = Load-sensing systems (LS-system) generates less power losses as the pump can reduce both flow and pressure to match the load requirements, but requires more tuning than the CP-system with respect to system stability. The LS-system also requires additional logical valves and compensator valves in the directional valves, thus it is technically more complex and more expensive than the CP-system. The LS-system generates a constant power loss related to the regulating pressure drop for the pump regulator : Power loss = \\\\Delta p_{LS} \\\\cdot Q_{tot} The average \\\\Delta p_{LS} is around 2 MPa (290 psi). If the pump flow is high the extra loss can be considerable. The power loss also increases if the load pressures vary a lot. The cylinder areas, motor displacements and mechanical torque arms must be designed to match load pressure in order to bring down the power losses. Pump pressure always equals the maximum load pressure when several functions are run simultaneously and the power input to the pump equals the (max. load pressure + ŒîpLS) x sum of flow. =Five basic types of load-sensing systems= # Load sensing without compensators in the directional valves. Hydraulically controlled LS-pump. # Load sensing with up-stream compensator for each connected directional valve. Hydraulically controlled LS-pump. # Load sensing with down-stream compensator for each connected directional valve. Hydraulically controlled LS-pump. # Load sensing with a combination of up- stream and down-stream compensators. Hydraulically controlled LS-pump. # Load sensing with synchronized, both electric controlled pump displacement and electric controlled valve flow area for faster response, increased stability and fewer system losses. This is a new type of LS-system, not yet fully developed. Technically the down-stream mounted compensator in a valveblock can physically be mounted \\"up-stream\\", but work as a down-stream compensator. System type (3) gives the advantage that activated functions are synchronized independent of pump flow capacity. The flow relation between 2 or more activated functions remains independent of load pressures, even if the pump reaches the maximum swivel angle. This feature is important for machines that often run with the pump at maximum swivel angle and with several activated functions that must be synchronized in speed, such as with excavators. With type (4) system, the functions with up-stream compensators have priority. Example: Steering-function for a wheel loader. The system type with down- stream compensators usually have a unique trademark depending on the manufacturer of the valves, for example \\"LSC\\" (Linde Hydraulics), \\"LUDV\\" (Bosch Rexroth Hydraulics) and \\"Flowsharing\\" (Parker Hydraulics) etc. No official standardized name for this type of system has been established but Flowsharing is a common name for it.  Components  =Hydraulic pump= An exploded view of an external gear pump. Hydraulic pumps supply fluid to the components in the system. Pressure in the system develops in reaction to the load. Hence, a pump rated for 5,000 psi is capable of maintaining flow against a load of 5,000 psi. Pumps have a power density about ten times greater than an electric motor (by volume). They are powered by an electric motor or an engine, connected through gears, belts, or a flexible elastomeric coupling to reduce vibration. Common types of hydraulic pumps to hydraulic machinery applications are; * Gear pump: cheap, durable (especially in g-rotor form), simple. Less efficient, because they are constant (fixed) displacement, and mainly suitable for pressures below 20 MPa (3000 psi). * Vane pump: cheap and simple, reliable. Good for higher-flow low-pressure output. * Axial piston pump: many designed with a variable displacement mechanism, to vary output flow for automatic control of pressure. There are various axial piston pump designs, including swashplate (sometimes referred to as a valveplate pump) and checkball (sometimes referred to as a wobble plate pump). The most common is the swashplate pump. A variable-angle swashplate causes the pistons to reciprocate a greater or lesser distance per rotation, allowing output flow rate and pressure to be varied (greater displacement angle causes higher flow rate, lower pressure, and vice versa). * Radial piston pump: normally used for very high pressure at small flows. Piston pumps are more expensive than gear or vane pumps, but provide longer life operating at higher pressure, with difficult fluids and longer continuous duty cycles. Piston pumps make up one half of a hydrostatic transmission. =Control valves= scissor lift Directional control valves route the fluid to the desired actuator. They usually consist of a spool inside a cast iron or steel housing. The spool slides to different positions in the housing, and intersecting grooves and channels route the fluid based on the spool's position. The spool has a central (neutral) position maintained with springs; in this position the supply fluid is blocked, or returned to tank. Sliding the spool to one side routes the hydraulic fluid to an actuator and provides a return path from the actuator to tank. When the spool is moved to the opposite direction the supply and return paths are switched. When the spool is allowed to return to neutral (center) position the actuator fluid paths are blocked, locking it in position. Directional control valves are usually designed to be stackable, with one valve for each hydraulic cylinder, and one fluid input supplying all the valves in the stack. Tolerances are very tight in order to handle the high pressure and avoid leaking, spools typically have a clearance with the housing of less than a thousandth of an inch (25 ¬µm). The valve block will be mounted to the machine's frame with a three point pattern to avoid distorting the valve block and jamming the valve's sensitive components. The spool position may be actuated by mechanical levers, hydraulic pilot pressure, or solenoids which push the spool left or right. A seal allows part of the spool to protrude outside the housing, where it is accessible to the actuator. The main valve block is usually a stack of off the shelf directional control valves chosen by flow capacity and performance. Some valves are designed to be proportional (flow rate proportional to valve position), while others may be simply on-off. The control valve is one of the most expensive and sensitive parts of a hydraulic circuit. * Pressure relief valves are used in several places in hydraulic machinery; on the return circuit to maintain a small amount of pressure for brakes, pilot lines, etc... On hydraulic cylinders, to prevent overloading and hydraulic line/seal rupture. On the hydraulic reservoir, to maintain a small positive pressure which excludes moisture and contamination. * Pressure regulators reduce the supply pressure of hydraulic fluids as needed for various circuits. * Sequence valves control the sequence of hydraulic circuits; to ensure that one hydraulic cylinder is fully extended before another starts its stroke, for example. * Shuttle valves provide a logical or function. * Check valves are one-way valves, allowing an accumulator to charge and maintain its pressure after the machine is turned off, for example. * Pilot controlled check valves are one-way valve that can be opened (for both directions) by a foreign pressure signal. For instance if the load should not be held by the check valve anymore. Often the foreign pressure comes from the other pipe that is connected to the motor or cylinder. * Counterbalance valves are in fact a special type of pilot controlled check valve. Whereas the check valve is open or closed, the counterbalance valve acts a bit like a pilot controlled flow control. * Cartridge valves are in fact the inner part of a check valve; they are off the shelf components with a standardized envelope, making them easy to populate a proprietary valve block. They are available in many configurations; on/off, proportional, pressure relief, etc. They generally screw into a valve block and are electrically controlled to provide logic and automated functions. * Hydraulic fuses are in- line safety devices designed to automatically seal off a hydraulic line if pressure becomes too low, or safely vent fluid if pressure becomes too high. * Auxiliary valves in complex hydraulic systems may have auxiliary valve blocks to handle various duties unseen to the operator, such as accumulator charging, cooling fan operation, air conditioning power, etc. They are usually custom valves designed for the particular machine, and may consist of a metal block with ports and channels drilled. Cartridge valves are threaded into the ports and may be electrically controlled by switches or a microprocessor to route fluid power as needed. =Actuators= * Hydraulic cylinder * Hydraulic motor (a pump plumbed in reverse); hydraulic motors with axial configuration use Swashplates for highly accurate control and also in 'no stop' continuous (360¬∞) precision positioning mechanisms. These are frequently driven by several hydraulic pistons acting in sequence. * Hydrostatic transmission * Brakes =Reservoir= The hydraulic fluid reservoir holds excess hydraulic fluid to accommodate volume changes from: cylinder extension and contraction, temperature driven expansion and contraction, and leaks. The reservoir is also designed to aid in separation of air from the fluid and also work as a heat accumulator to cover losses in the system when peak power is used. Design engineers are always pressured to reduce the size of hydraulic reservoirs, while equipment operators always appreciate larger reservoirs. Reservoirs can also help separate dirt and other particulate from the oil, as the particulate will generally settle to the bottom of the tank. Some designs include dynamic flow channels on the fluid's return path that allow for a smaller reservoir. =Accumulators= Accumulators are a common part of hydraulic machinery. Their function is to store energy by using pressurized gas. One type is a tube with a floating piston. On the one side of the piston there is a charge of pressurized gas, and on the other side is the fluid. Bladders are used in other designs. Reservoirs store a system's fluid. Examples of accumulator uses are backup power for steering or brakes, or to act as a shock absorber for the hydraulic circuit., =Hydraulic fluid= Also known as tractor fluid, hydraulic fluid is the life of the hydraulic circuit. It is usually petroleum oil with various additives. Some hydraulic machines require fire resistant fluids, depending on their applications. In some factories where food is prepared, either an edible oil or water is used as a working fluid for health and safety reasons. In addition to transferring energy, hydraulic fluid needs to lubricate components, suspend contaminants and metal filings for transport to the filter, and to function well to several hundred degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius. =Filters= Filters are an important part of hydraulic systems which removes the unwanted particles from fluid. Metal particles are continually produced by mechanical components and need to be removed along with other contaminants. Filters may be positioned in many locations. The filter may be located between the reservoir and the pump intake. Blockage of the filter will cause cavitation and possibly failure of the pump. Sometimes the filter is located between the pump and the control valves. This arrangement is more expensive, since the filter housing is pressurized, but eliminates cavitation problems and protects the control valve from pump failures. The third common filter location is just before the return line enters the reservoir. This location is relatively insensitive to blockage and does not require a pressurized housing, but contaminants that enter the reservoir from external sources are not filtered until passing through the system at least once. Filters are used from 7 micron to 15 micron depends upon the viscosity grade of hydraulic oil. = Tubes, pipes and hoses= Hydraulic tubes are seamless steel precision pipes, specially manufactured for hydraulics. The tubes have standard sizes for different pressure ranges, with standard diameters up to 100 mm. The tubes are supplied by manufacturers in lengths of 6 m, cleaned, oiled and plugged. The tubes are interconnected by different types of flanges (especially for the larger sizes and pressures), welding cones/nipples (with o-ring seal), several types of flare connection and by cut-rings. In larger sizes, hydraulic pipes are used. Direct joining of tubes by welding is not acceptable since the interior cannot be inspected. Hydraulic pipe is used in case standard hydraulic tubes are not available. Generally these are used for low pressure. They can be connected by threaded connections, but usually by welds. Because of the larger diameters the pipe can usually be inspected internally after welding. Black pipe is non- galvanized and suitable for welding. Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, and fluid compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes can not be used, usually to provide flexibility for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and steel layers. A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The bend radius of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum bend radius will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals. Tubes and pipes for hydraulic n applications are internally oiled before the system is commissioned. Usually steel piping is painted outside. Where flare and other couplings are used, the paint is removed under the nut, and is a location where corrosion can begin. For this reason, in marine applications most piping is stainless steel. =Seals, fittings and connections= Components of a hydraulic system [sources (e.g. pumps), controls (e.g. valves) and actuators (e.g. cylinders)] need connections that will contain and direct the hydraulic fluid without leaking or losing the pressure that makes them work. In some cases, the components can be made to bolt together with fluid paths built-in. In more cases, though, rigid tubing or flexible hoses are used to direct the flow from one component to the next. Each component has entry and exit points for the fluid involved (called ports) sized according to how much fluid is expected to pass through it. There are a number of standardized methods in use to attach the hose or tube to the component. Some are intended for ease of use and service, others are better for higher system pressures or control of leakage. The most common method, in general, is to provide in each component a female-threaded port, on each hose or tube a female-threaded captive nut, and use a separate adapter fitting with matching male threads to connect the two. This is functional, economical to manufacture, and easy to service. Fittings serve several purposes; # To join components with ports of different sizes. # To bridge different standards; O-ring boss to JIC, or pipe threads to face seal, for example. # To allow proper orientation of components, a 90¬∞, 45¬∞, straight, or swivel fitting is chosen as needed. They are designed to be positioned in the correct orientation and then tightened. # To incorporate bulkhead hardware to pass the fluid through an obstructing wall. # A quick disconnect fitting may be added to a machine without modification of hoses or valves A typical piece of machinery or heavy equipment may have thousands of sealed connection points and several different types: * Pipe fittings, the fitting is screwed in until tight, difficult to orient an angled fitting correctly without over or under tightening. * O-ring boss, the fitting is screwed into a boss and orientated as needed, an additional nut tightens the fitting, washer and o-ring in place. * Flare fittings, are metal to metal compression seals deformed with a cone nut and pressed into a flare mating. * Face seal, metal flanges with a groove and o-ring seal are fastened together. * Beam seals are costly metal to metal seals used primarily in aircraft. * Swaged seals, tubes are connected with fittings that are swaged permanently in place. Primarily used in aircraft. Elastomeric seals (O-ring boss and face seal) are the most common types of seals in heavy equipment and are capable of reliably sealing 6000+ psi (40+ MPa) of fluid pressure.

Repeats were shown on the network's Sunday afternoon schedule in the summer of 1971. It was similar in style to the studio's considerably more successful The Flintstones, and used several of the same essential voice actors and plots. Also, like The Flintstones, Where's Huddles? aired in the evening during prime time, had a laugh track, and had somewhat adult themes. All ten episodes were produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The summer replacement was intended be a trial run for a full prime-time series, but only lasted for ten episodes. The episodes were repeated again in summer 1971. Overview The show's premise involved a professional football quarterback named Ed Huddles (voiced by Cliff Norton) and his neighbor, the team's center Bubba McCoy (voiced by Mel Blanc). They played for a team called the Rhinos. Other characters included Ed's wife Marge Huddles (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl), the Huddles' daughter Pom-Pom, and their black teammate Freight Train (voiced by Herb Jeffries). Bubba's wife Penny McCoy was played by comedic actress Marie Wilson in her final role before her death from cancer in 1972. The regular foil was Claude Pertwee (Paul Lynde), who lived alone with his cat Beverley and could tolerate the wives, but considered the men to be \\"savages\\".It was broadly hinted that Pertwee was gay, especially since \\"savage\\" was slang for homosexuals at the time. (Lynde, who did the voice, was gay himself, though not publicly.) His look and temperamental behavior are similar to Mr. Peevly from Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch. The Rhinos' football announcer was voiced by sportscaster Dick Enberg, who at the time was the voice of the Los Angeles Rams. Alan Reed had a recurring role as Mad Dog Maloney, the Rhinos' coach. The Huddles had a dog named Fumbles, voiced by Don Messick. Fumbles, much like Muttley, would often laugh at someone's misfortune, but whereas Muttley's laugh was wheezy in nature, Fumbles' laugh was more guttural. Most of the in-game action consisted of recycled animation (a shot of the team's running back side-kicking and stiff-arming defenders was one shot that was particularly frequently used). Paul Lynde was credited for his role in this series as Claude Pertwee; this was unusual for Lynde, as he generally went uncredited in his other work for Hanna-Barbera at the time, which consisted mostly of Saturday morning cartoons (as opposed to Where's Huddles?, which aired in prime time). In addition to the Huddles television series, there was also a comic book (with art by Roger Armstrong) which ran for three issues from Gold Key/Whitman Comics in 1971. Episodes =Season 1 (1970)= Home media On July 26, 2016, Warner Archive released Where's Huddles?: The Complete Series on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection.

In 2019, General Mills rereleased Chex Quest and its previously unofficial 2008 sequel, and presented a mini-documentary on YouTube.Apple News/Food & Wine Magazine May 24th 2019. Gameplay Zorching a Flemoid Originally based on the Doom engine, the gameplay present in Chex Quest is substantially identical to its predecessor. The game is played in a first person perspective with the player character navigating through quasi-3D environments while enemies attempt to attack and immobilize him. Along the way, various cereal-themed power-ups, weapons, and ammunition can be found that can boost the player character's health and make him better able to counterattack or flee his enemies. When the final boss is defeated in the last level, the game is won. A few notable differences from Doom are evident, however, regarding enemy profiles (specifically the loss of long-range attacks in low-level enemies and the loss of movement in high-level enemies) and the number of levels in each world (restricted to 5 levels in Chex Quest).Take That, Orphan Annie!. The Buffalo News. 10 August 1997. Plot Set on a distant planet named Bazoik, the game follows the Chex Warrior, a soldier clad in a Chex-shaped suit of armor, as he eradicates the invasion of the planet by the 'Flemoids': a species of slimy, green invertebrates, who have infested the planet and captured many helpless colonists, whom the Chex Warrior must save. His main weapons are devices called \\"zorchers\\", which teleports his enemies to their home dimension. The game starts at the landing pad of the research center on Bazoik; other levels include the laboratory, the arboretum, and finally, the caverns of Bazoik, where the Flemoids have established their colony. Their principal weapon is the use of mucus as a projectile. Development Produced with a small team of developers on a budget of around $500,000, Chex Quest began life as the brainchild of the WatersMolitor promotion agency ‚Äì an award-winning group that had been hired by Ralston Foods to reinvigorate the Chex cereal brand. The original game concept was created by Dean Hyers and Mike Koenigs as a non- violent CD-ROM computer game to be released with 5.7 million boxes of Rice Chex, Wheat Chex, and Corn Chex cereals in order to cast Chex as a cereal that was exciting and fun for children while appealing to modern sensibilities by targeting home PC owners. The game would be a high-quality program whose normal retail value would be between $30 and $35. However, it would be offered to consumers for free with no increase to the cost of the cereal box. The development of Chex Quest differed from traditional video game development in that the basic game engine had already been created and the bulk of the creation process consisted of aesthetic changes made to the music and artwork from The Ultimate Doom. For budgetary reasons, Id Software was contacted and an inexpensive license was obtained for the Doom engine which was considered obsolete in light of Id's recently released Quake. Chex Quest was the first foray into professional game development for lead artist Charles Jacobi and programmer Scott Holman, though both had previously modded Doom levels in the past. In an interview with PC Gamer magazine in 2009, Jacobi stated that the biggest reason for the lasting success of Chex Quest has been that it is still essentially a disguised version of Doom with basically unaltered game dynamics. Indeed, the game has been recognized for having a sense of humor about its identity and origins.Plante, Chris. The Forgotten First-Person Shooters You Need to Play: Chex Quest . UGO. (reprinted at 1up.com ) 24 September 2010. Humorous aspects of the conversion take the form of ironic in- jokes related to Doom resulting from the more or less exact \\"translation\\" of previous non-essential Doom decorations into their non-essential Chex Quest equivalents. Thus the bloodied bodies and the twitching torsos from Doom become the goo-covered cereal pieces and the cereal victims twitching to extract themselves from goo in Chex Quest. Likewise, according to the plot the \\"health\\" meter represents the Chex Warrior's ability to move, with 0% representing being completely covered in slime and unable to move. The picture of the Chex Warrior in the status bar display becomes progressively more coated in slime, as opposed to bleeding as does the face in Doom. Because time was limited, pre-existing tools popular with the Doom fan community (such as the level creation tool Doombuilder) were utilized in level design, and sound effects such as the distinctive vocalization of the Flemoids were created by creative director Dean Hyers and audio designer Andrew Benson playing around in a sound booth. During development, aesthetic decisions had to be run by Ralston for approval and this resulted in a number of modifications. The zorchers, for instance, were originally intended to look like a classic raygun, though they were changed to look like a remote control or Star Trek tricorder due to Ralston's concerns that it looked too much like a violent gun. All of the higher-powered weapons were then designed on the tricorder model. However, the Zorch launcher and Phasing Zorcher were modified again toward the end of the design phase to have a more distinctive look. Zorch weapons were also originally going to \\"neutralize\\" flemoids with nutritional foods like banana slices, milk, and strawberries, but due to Ralston's worries that this might encourage food fighting, this was changed so that the zorcher emitted pink light and \\"sent back\\" the flemoids, making them vanish. Early designs for the Chex Warrior also had his head and body all as one giant Chex piece. However, this was changed due to aesthetic similarities to the M&M;'s animated characters. The flemoids were originally yellow, but this was changed to green due to limitations in the Doom color palette.Jacobi, Charles. Chex Quest 1 Concepts! Chucktropolis. Retrieved 1 February 2013. Additional development team members include: Producer Kimberly Hyers, Technical Coordinator Dave Brus, Project Manager Mary Bregi.Info provided by Creative Director ;Promotion In support of the promotion, coupons and advertisements were included in newspapers and magazines with total circulation of 42 million; promotional art was added to the front of all boxes containing the game; a 30-second television advertisement was broadcast; and a website (chexquest.com) was launched to present game tips, Chex recipes, and further plot details such as character biographies. To cut down on development costs, WatersMolitor formed a promotional partnership with America Online who actually manufactured the CDs in exchange for which all copies of Chex Quest came bundled with the AOL software and a \\"50 Free Hours\\" subscription offer. WatersMolitor also created a telephone help-line for gamers who encountered problems with the gameGaw, Jonathan.

Star Tribune. 31 January 1997. and hired fledgling new media company, Digital Caf√©, to provide coding, plot, animations, original music and art for the game. =Comparison with Doom= Some parameters used to start Doom are also used to start Chex Quest. Despite Chex Quest's major changes from its predecessor, there are still a few remaining relics (e.g. levels from other Ultimate Doom episodes and some in-game text). While Doom has a cheat code scheme in which every cheat starts with \\"id\\", the codes in Chex Quest are based on the names of the people in the production crew of the game, with a few exceptions.Chex Quest Cheats & Codes. IGN. 2012. PC speaker sound effects from the DOS version of Doom have been modified and are used in Chex Quest. Whereas Doom is rated M for Mature, Chex Quest was made to be a child-friendly game for all audiences. Nearly all of the graphics and audio from Doom have been replaced, from textures to enemies to weapons. ;Leftover levels Chex Quest has only the first five levels from The Ultimate Doom converted for the game. Some leftover levels are playable (as Chex Quest conversions) only via the level warp parameter at startup.Foster, Neil. Chex Quest. Hardcore Gaming 101. 13 February 2014. These leftover levels include maps 6 through 9 from episode 1 as well as all maps in episodes 2, 3, and 4. In these levels the music reverts to the original score from Ultimate Doom. After the level warp parameter is used to access maps E3M1 or E4M1, the remainder of the levels (through map 5) within the episode selected can be accessed by completing the levels in the episode in order (just as with the standard level progression in Doom or Chex Quest). Unfortunately, bugs prevent any of the other levels from launching upon completion of the level before it, and similarly E4M9 cannot be reached from E4M2 as previously. Completion of E2M5 (via either exit) displays the end graphic originally displayed at the end of The Shores Of Hell, the second episode of the original Doom, and completing E3M5 displays the end sequence from Inferno, the third episode. Likewise, completing E4M5 displays the end graphic from Thy Flesh Consumed, the fourth and final episode of The Ultimate Doom. Both of the latter two end sequences feature a decapitated rabbit named Daisy. The intermission screen shown after completing E2M5 Episode intermission texts which originally (i.e. in Doom) were displayed upon completion of E1M8, E2M8, E3M8, and E4M8 are now found in modified form for Chex Quest. Thus completion of E1M5 in Chex Quest now displays the new message: \\"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THE NEXT MISSION? PRESS THE ESCAPE KEY TO CONTINUE...\\" Completion of the leftover level E2M5 displays the message: \\"YOU'VE DONE IT!!\\" which never appears in The Ultimate Doom. Likewise, the episode intermission text displayed upon completion of E3M5 reads: \\"WONDERFUL JOB!\\", and that displayed upon completion of E4M5 reads: \\"FANTASTIC\\" again neither of which ever appeared in the original game. Charles Jacobi has said that there were never any plans to produce more than five levels and that he knew Scott Holman, another programmer, ran through the text strings and changed any that seemed inappropriate, without knowing where they went. The skins for the more difficult enemies from Doom have not been converted as these enemies were not employed in Chex Quest levels, but rather the skins have been removed entirely. This introduces an additional experience for those playing the \\"leftover levels\\" as these difficult enemies still exist in a completely invisible form. This also goes for items like the partial invisibility, berserker pack, light amp goggles, and all skull keycards. In addition, the music from the original registered Doom as well as the overworld graphics (depicting Gigeresque scenes of death and hell) and maps that were not modified (E1M6 through E4M9) were left intact, allowing anybody with WAD file editing knowledge to create their own copy of registered Doom (specifically The Ultimate Doom). Reception and legacy On release, the game was received largely positively by gamers. Consumers of diverse ages gave enthusiastic feedback, and there were many requests for the development of sequels. Corporate sales of Chex cereal also saw a tremendous boost with incremental volume over base increasing by 295% and volume share increasing 48% from the previous year. These increases were directly attributed to the release of Chex Quest, and General Mills deemed the promotion \\"highly successful.\\"Fitzgerald, Kate. \\"News - Events & Promotions: See The CD-ROMs: Package Goods Lure Consumers With Offers Of Free Software.\\" Advertising Age. Pg.48. 29 September 1997. Although the promotion only lasted 6 weeks, the game continued to be played well beyond the promotional period and promotional marketing groups considered the brand image to have been revitalized \\"from old-fashioned and stodgy to exciting, fun and modern.\\" Despite this, what little critical attention Chex Quest received in the video game press tended to be negative. Comparisons of the game to its forerunner (Doom) and to other similar games of the day were often unfavorable to Chex Quest, which was pejoratively labeled a \\"Doom clone\\", and the game was regarded as an imitation with little to no innovation.Arsenault, Dominic. Video Game Genre, Evolution and Innovation - Part III. Game Genre and Innovation: Imitation and Evolution. Eludamos: Journal for Computer Game Culture. Vol.3, No.2. Pp.149-176. 2009. Noted cereal scholar Scott Bruce decried General Mills' decision to invent a new mascot for Chex cereal for such frivolous purposes, and dismissed the Chex Warrior as not compelling enough to sell the product.Teitell, Beth. Sweet nothings - Free playthings? Most cereal boxes come up empty. The Boston Herald. 17 July 1997. In modern times, Chex Quest is often considered to have been highly innovative and to have pioneered the use of licensed modding to insert product placement into established titles.Vedrashko, Ilya.

Catch a 'Vibe' on line. The Boston Herald. 8 August 1997. The game has attracted a sizeable cult following, and its fanbase has been noted with interest by critics for the continued devotion to the game despite its great age. Other critics, however, have characterized the game as bad even for a Doom clone.Mamatas, Nick; Yeffeth, Glen; Thomason, Jennifer.

Developed on an even tighter schedule than the original game, Chex Quest 2 was rushed to completion and consequently the level design and progression notably suffered. Plans were drafted to allow individual WAD file levels and updates to the game to be posted on the company Web site as an effective way of generating traffic there,The Gasman Cometh. The Buffalo News. 16 February 1997. and an end sequence suggesting a possible third installation was available for viewing. Before a third title in the series was developed, the promotion came to an end and both the original Chex Quest and Chex Quest 2 became effectively unavailable until they were posted for download on Internet fan pages several years later. A number of fangame editions were completed by fans to act as the third game in the series. However, nearly a decade would pass before a second sequel was created with any claim of canonicity with the original two games. In this sequel's plot, the Chex Warrior returns to his home planet and lands in Chex City only to discover that the Flemoid threat has reached his homeworld. There, the player battles through a terrestrial spaceport, a cinema (showing three videos each endlessly looping), a museum, and the eponymous city (Chextropolis), until reaching the sewers to confront an end boss named \\"The Maximus\\".  Chex Quest 3  In 2008, Chex Quest 3 was developed and released as a service to fans by former Digital Caf√© members Charles Jacobi (art director and lead artist) and Scott Holman (programmer). Former Digital Caf√© sound design leader Andrew Benson, also contributed several songs for the game. Originally intended as a single standalone level, Jacobi announced the development of a full sequel at the Chex Quest Fan Page (Chexquest.org) in June 2008, and the full game was released in September of the same year.Plante, Chris.

Chex Quest 2 in particular had been remastered, with some levels significantly revised or completely overhauled. Charles Jacobi credited the praise and compliments of fans, especially through fan-made projects such as one titled \\"The Ultimate Chex Quest\\", as inspiration to complete this project. The plot for this sequel is set ten years later than the events of the first two Chex Quest games, with the invasion of the planet Ralston by the Flemoids. The breadth of the story was expanded to a much larger scale, possessing a seemingly more grim scenario than the predecessors‚Äîthe latter of which Charles Jacobi dispelled as unintentional, in that he simply \\"wanted it to feel bigger\\" than the first two games.  Chex Quest HD  In response to an interview question regarding the possibility of a canonical Kickstarter-funded Chex Quest 4, Jacobi pointed out that the franchise is owned by General Mills so a funded project would likely violate copyright and trademark laws. However, freely distributed non- tarnishing modifications created by hobbyists would probably be protected as free speech. In 2016 Jacobi revealed that a high definition remake of the original game called Chex Quest HD was in development using Unreal Engine 4 with the permission of General Mills. A trailer for the remake was released in February 2019. Like the original game it will contain five levels and be released for free. The remake was released on May 18th, 2020 and can be acquired through Steam. The Chex Warrior, the protagonist of the original game, is given the name Fred Chexter in the remake. =Fanbase= Similarities have been drawn by fans between Chex Quest and GoldenEye with respect to the legal rights to the game subsequent to the original creators' purchase by larger companies. These corporate events have made the likelihood of later official sequels rather uncertain. As with GoldenEye, however, Chex Quest still has a devoted cult fanbase who still create fan-art, new WAD files, and even full sequels to the game 20 years after the game's original release‚Äîa fact that has been used to highlight the capacity for PC games to foster and support community innovation.Decker, Logan. FanService. PC Gamer. #207. Pg.5. December 2010. Chex Quest has gained a devoted fanbase since its cereal-box release in 1996. Often simultaneous fans of Chex cereal and the Doom series, the active Chex Quest fan community has produced a host of fan-made sequels, and numerous unofficial projects have been undertaken including the Chex Trek series and the Zorchmatch mod. Other examples which have arguably entered the fanon include a fan-made Chex Quest 3 and Chex Quest 4, and such .wad and Game Maker sequels as Return of the Chex Warrior, Chex Quest Project Z, and the Chex Quest platformer. There are fan-made Chex Quest WADs designed for nearly all major Doom source ports, even the original Doom engine.

The first tenant was the Speaker of the Senate of Canada, Joseph Edouard Cauchon. The building was named by Cauchon's wife after Stadacona, the First Nations name for their native Quebec City. It then became home to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and his family, who lived there from 1878 to 1883 before moving to Earnscliffe. It later became home to other prominent individuals, including Sir Frederick Borden and William Rowley. After World War II, it was purchased by the Kingdom of Belgium and became the residence of the Belgian ambassador. In 1995, downsizing led them to put it on the market for $1.7 million. It was bought by the Government of Brunei Darussalam, which uses the building as its High Commission.

In chess notation, it is almost always represented the same way as a single check (\\"+\\"), but is sometimes symbolized by \\"++\\" (however, \\"++\\" is also sometimes used to denote checkmateTim Just and Daniel Burg, 2003, U.S. Chess Federation's Official Rules of Chess, 5th ed., , p. 218). This article uses the latter convention for clarity. Chess The most common form of double check involves one piece moving to deliver check and revealing a discovered check at the same time from a piece it had been blocking. (Such a check is an inherent part of the type of smothered mate known as Philidor's legacy.) The only possible replies to a double check are king moves, as both checking pieces cannot be captured or blocked at once. In some cases, the king can capture one checking piece and escape the other in a single move. In exceptional circumstances, it is possible for the moved piece to not participate in the double check (i.e. to give a \\"double discovered check\\", though this name is not actually used). The only way for this to happen in orthodox chess is by way of an en passant capture. In the position shown, Black has just played 1...g7‚Äìg5. White replies 2.hxg6++. The result is a double check even though the pawn White moved does not give check (one check is given by the rook, discovered by the capturing pawn's move; the other by the bishop, discovered by the captured pawn's removal). Such a double check is extremely rare in practical play, but is sometimes found in problems. =Game examples= Aron Nimzowitsch wrote, \\"Even the laziest king flees wildly in the face of a double check.\\" Because the only possible response to a double check is a king move, the double check is often an important tactical motif. A famous example is R√©ti‚ÄìTartakower, Vienna 1910, which arose after 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Qd3 e5 6.dxe5 Qa5+ 7.Bd2 Qxe5 8.0-0-0 Nxe4 9.Qd8+ (sacrificing a queen in order to set up a double check) Kxd8 10.Bg5++ and White mates after 10...Ke8 11.Rd8# or 10...Kc7 11.Bd8#. A double check was also seen in the celebrated Evergreen Game, Anderssen‚ÄìDufresne, 1852. Anderssen won with 20.Rxe7+! Nxe7 21.Qxd7+!! (a queen sacrifice to set up a deadly double check) Kxd7 22.Bf5++ Ke8 (or 22...Kc6 23.Bd7#) 23.Bd7+ Kf8 24.Bxe7#. =Variants= { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\"   } In chess with variant rules or fairy pieces, other ways of delivering a double check may be possible. Triple, quadruple and even quintuple checks may also be possible. For example, in the position shown, after Black plays 1...d5, White plays 2.exd6e.p.+++++ (the moa is a non-leaping knight which first takes a diagonal step, then an orthogonal one; the grasshopper captures by leaping over an intervening piece). After the en passant capture, five pieces check the black king: both moas, the rook, the grasshopper and the bishop. Xiangqi In xiangqi, the Chinese version of chess, triple check and even quadruple check is possible even without using fairy pieces, as in the following examples: { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"font-size:88%; width:40em; border- collapse:collapse;\\" -valign=\\"top\\"  style=\\"border:#ccc 1px solid; padding:5px;\\"  Triple check: Red moved his horse from e5 to d7, giving check and exposing a double check from the chariot and cannon.  style=\\"border:#ccc 1px solid; padding:5px;\\"  Quadruple check: Red moved his chariot from f9 to e9, uncovering two checks from the horses, giving a check of its own, and making a platform for the cannon at e7 to give yet another check. In janggi, using the same pieces and adding two elephants which both attack the general through the chariot's square allows a sextuple check. } References Chess terminology de:Abzug (Schach)#Doppelschach sv:Schacka#Dubbelschack ","title":"Double check"},{"id":"1372392","text":"Noel Treacy (born 18 December 1951) is a former Irish Fianna F√°il politician. He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Galway East constituency from 1982 to 2011. Treacy was born in Ballinasloe, County Galway in 1951. He was educated at Gurteen National School and St. Joseph's College, Garbally Park in Ballinasloe. He worked as an auctioneer and financial services manager before entering public life. He is married to Mary Cloonan and has three daughters and one son. Treacy was first elected to D√°il √âireann at a by-election in July 1982 caused by the death of Fianna F√°il TD Johnny Callanan and was re-elected at each election until his retirement in 2011. His election marked the last time a government party was successful in winning a by-election until the election of Patrick Nulty of the Labour Party in the Dublin West by-election in 2011. He was a member of Galway County Council from 1985‚Äì91. Over his many years in the D√°il, Treacy has held a number of junior ministerial portfolios. In 1987 Treacy joined the junior ministerial team as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works and the Central Development Committee. The following year he became Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. It was in this capacity that Treacy became the State's first Minister for Heritage Affairs. Between 1989 and 1991 he served as Minister of State for Children at the Department of Health, before being appointed Minister of State at the Department of Justice with responsibility for Law Reform. In 1992 Treacy returned to the Department of Finance again before serving at the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Transport, Energy and Communications during the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìLabour Party government holding special responsibility for Energy. Some months after Fianna F√°il's return to power in 1997 Treacy became Minister for Science, Technology and Commerce at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science replacing Michael Smith who had been promoted to cabinet following the resignation of Ray Burke. Following re-election in 2002 he became Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, with responsibility for Food and Horticulture. He contested the 1999 European Parliament election in Connacht‚ÄìUlster unsuccessfully. Following Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's cabinet reshuffle in September 2004, Treacy was appointed Minister of State at the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach, with special responsibility for European Affairs. Treacy was returned to D√°il √âireann at the 2007 general election. This was his eighth successive time to be elected. However, the manner in which this was achieved is somewhat unusual in Irish politics for it was Treacy's seventh time to be elected at a general election without reaching the necessary quota of votes. However, following 17 years as a Minister of State in various administrations, Treacy was not reappointed to a junior ministerial post by then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. He was subsequently appointed Chairman of Joint Oireachtas Committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. He retired from politics at the 2011 general election.

The Eora (Yura) are an Aboriginal Australian people of New South Wales. Eora is the name given by the earliest settlers to a group of Aboriginal people belonging to the clans along the coastal area of what is now known as the Sydney basin, in New South Wales, Australia. Contact with the first white settlement's bridgehead into Australia quickly devastated much of the population through epidemics of smallpox and other diseases. Their descendants live on, though their languages, social system, way of life and traditions are mostly lost. Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity occurred in and around Sydney for at least 30,000 years, in the Upper Paleolithic period. However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools found in Sydney's far western suburbs gravel sediments were dated to be from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP, which would mean that humans could have been in the region earlier than thought. Ethnonym The meaning of the Eora ethnonym is not known. Contemporary accounts state that it simply meant \\"people\\", though one theory proposes that the word was constructed from e (yes) and ora (country). Descendants of the Eora use the word as a regional name. Language The language spoken by the Eora has, since the time of R. H. Mathews, been called Dharuk, which generally refers to what is known as the inland variety, as opposed to the coastal form Iyora (or Eora). It was described as \\"extremely grateful to the ear, being in many instances expressive and sonorous,\\" by David Collins. It became extinct after the first two generations, and has been partially reconstructed in some general outlines from the many notes made of it by the original colonists, in particular from the notebooks of William Dawes, who picked up the languages spoken by the Eora from his companion Patyegarang. Some of the words of Aboriginal language still in use today are from the Eora (possibly Tharawal) language and include: dingo=dingu; woomera=wamara; boomerang=combining wamarang and bumarit, two sword-like fighting sticks; corroboree=garabara; wallaby, wombat, waratah, and boobook (owl). The Australian bush term bogey (to bathe) comes from a Port Jackson Dharuk root buugi-. Country Eora territory, composed of sandstone coastal outcrops and ridges, coves, mangrove swamps, creeks and tidal lagoons, was estimated by Norman Tindale to extend over some , from Port Jackson's northern shores up to the Hawkesbury River plateau's margins, around Pittwater. Its southern borders were as far as Botany Bay and the Georges River. Westwards it extended to Parramatta. In terms of tribal boundaries, the Kuringgai lay to the north: on the Western edges were the Darug; and to the south, around Kundul were the Gwiyagal, a northern clan of the Tharawal. Their clan identification, belonging to numerous groups of about 50 members, overrode more general Eora loyalties, according to Governor Phillip, a point first made by David Collins and underlined decades later by a visiting Russian naval officer, Aleksey Rossiysky in 1814, who wrote: > each man considers his own community to be the best. When he chances to meet > a fellow-countryman from another community, and if someone speaks well of > the other man, he will invariably start to abuse him, saying that he is > reputed to be a cannibal, robber, great coward and so forth. Bands and clans Eora is used specifically of the people around the first area of white settlement in Sydney. The generic term Eora generally is used with a wider denotation to embrace some 29 bands. The sizes of bands, as opposed to clans, could range from 20 to 60 but averaged around 50 members. -gal denominates the clan or extendeds family group affixed to the place name. * Cammeraygal.

(Southern shore of Botany Bay) The Wangal, Wallumettagal and Burramattagal constituted the three Parramatta saltwater peoples. It has been suggested that these had a matrilineal pattern of descent. Lifestyle The traditional Eora people were largely coastal dwellers and lived mainly from the produce of the sea. They were expert in close-to-shore navigation, fishing, cooking, and eating in the bays and harbours in their bark canoes. The Eora people did not grow or plant crops; although the women picked herbs which were used in herbal remedies. They made extensive use of rock shelters, many of which were later destroyed by settlers who mined them for their rich concentrations of phosphates, which were then used for manure. Wetland management was important: Queenscliff, Curl Curl and the Dee Why lagoons furnished abundant food, culled seasonally. Summer foods consisted of oyster, netted mullet caught in nets, with fat fish caught on a line and larger fish taken on burley and speared from rock ledges. As summer drew to an end, feasting on turtle was a prized occasion. In winter, one foraged for and hunted possum, echidna, fruit bats, wallaby and kangaroo. The Eora placed a time limit on formal battles engaged to settle inter-tribal grievances. Such fights were regulated to begin late in the afternoon, and to cease shortly after twilight. History The first Sydney-area contact occurred when James Cook's Endeavour anchored in Botany Bay. A drawing, thought recently to be the handiwork of the Polynesian navigator Tupaia who was on board Cook's ship, survives depicting Aboriginals in Botany Bay, around Kurnell. The Eora were at first bewildered by settlers wreaking havoc on their trees and landscape. After an early contact with the Tharawal, meetings with Eora soon followed: they were disconcerted by the suspicion these visitors were ghosts, whose sex was unknown, until the delight of recognition ensued when one sailor dropped his pants to clarify their perplexity. There were 17 encounters in the first month, as the Eora sought to defend their territorial and fishing rights. Misunderstandings were frequent: Governor Phillip mistook scarring on women's temples as proof of men's mistreatment, when it was a trace of mourning practices. From the outset, the colonizers kidnapped Eora to train them to be intermediaries between the settlers and the indigenous people. The first man to suffer this fate was the Guringai Arabanoo, who died soon after in the smallpox epidemic of 1789. Several months later, Bennelong and Colebee were captured for a similar purpose. The latter escaped while Bennelong stayed for some months, learning more about the British food needs, etiquette, weaponry and hierarchy than anything they garnered from conversing with him. Eventually Phillip built a brick house for the former at the site of the present Sydney Opera House at Tubowgulle, (Bennelong Point). The hut was demolished five years later. When the First Fleet of 1,300 convicts, guards, and administrators arrived in January 1788, the Eora numbered about 1,500. By early 1789 frequent remarks were made of great numbers of decomposed bodies of Eora natives which settlers and sailors came across on beaches, in coves and in the bays. Canoes, commonly seen being paddled around the harbor of Port Jackson, had disappeared. The Sydney natives called the disease that was wiping them out (gai-galla) and what was diagnosed as a smallpox epidemic in April 1789 effectively decimated the Port Jackson tribes. Robert King states that of an estimated 2,000 Eora, half (Bennelong's contemporary estimate) were decimated by the contagion. Smallpox and other introduced disease, together with starvation from the plundering of their fish resources, is said to have accounted for the virtual extinction of the 30‚Äì50 strong Cadigal clan on the peninsula (kattai) between Sydney Cove and South Head. J. L. Kohen estimates that between 50 and 90 percent of members of local tribes died during the first three years of settlement. No settler child showed any symptoms of the disease. The English rebuffed any responsibility for the epidemic. It has been suggested that either rogue convicts/settlers or the governing authority itself spread the smallpox when ammunition stocks ran low and muskets, when not faulty, proved inadequate to defend the outpost. It is known that several officers of the Fleet had experience of war in North America where using smallpox to diminish tribes had been used as early as 1763. Several foreign reports, independent of English sources, such as those of Alexandro Malaspina in 1793 and Louis de Freycinet in 1802 give the impression that the settlers' relations with the Eora who survived the epidemic were generally amenable. Governor Phillip chose not to retaliate after he was speared by Willemering at Kayemai (Manly Cove) on 7 September 1790, in the presence of Bennelong who had, in the meantime, \\"gone bush\\". Governor William Bligh wrote in 1806: \\"Much has been said about the propriety of their being compelled to work as Slaves, but as I have ever considered them the real Proprietors of the Soil, I have never suffered any restraint whatever on these lines, or suffered any injury to be done to their persons or property.\\" Governor Macquarie established a Native Institution to house aboriginal and also Maori children to civilize them, on the condition they could only be visited by their parents on one day, 28 December, a year. It proved a disaster, and many children died there. Aboriginal people continued to camp in central Sydney until they were evicted from their camps, such as the one at Circular Quay in the 1880s. Song An Eora song has survived. It was sung by Bennelong and Yemmerrawanne at a concert in London in 1793. Their words and the music were transcribed by Edward Jones and published in 1811. A modern version of the song was rendered by Clarence Slockee and Matthew Doyle at the State Library of NSW, August 2010, and may be heard online. Notable people * Bennelong, a Wangal of the Eora peoples, served as a link between the British colony at Sydney and the Eora people in the early days of the colony.

It is the home of London Contemporary Dance School, Richard Alston Dance Company, and the Robin Howard Dance Theatre. History The building was designed by Robert William Edis as the headquarters of the 20th Middlesex (Artists') Volunteer Rifle Corps and built by Charles Kynoch and Company of Clapham between 1888 and 1889. It was officially opened by the Prince of Wales. The 20th Middlesex (Artists') Volunteer Rifle Corps became the 28th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Artists' Rifles) in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the Western Front. When the London Regiment was broken up and the battalions reallocated to other units in August 1937, the hall became the home of the Artists Rifles, The Rifle Brigade.Gregory, p. 253 The unit was disbanded in 1945, after the Second World War, but reformed again in the Rifle Brigade in January 1947 but transferred to the Army Air Corps in July 1947 as the 21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists Rifles).Gregory, p. 297 The drill hall fell vacant when the 21st Special Air Service Regiment moved out to the Duke of York's Headquarters in the late 1960s. The drill hall, which had been colloquially known as \\"The Artists Place\\", became simply \\"The Place\\" when the Contemporary Ballet Trust took over the premises in 1969. In 1976 the Contemporary Ballet Trust, under the leadership of Robin Howard, acquired the freehold of the premises as well as a site in Flaxman Terrace so facilitating an extension studio block to be built. In 1971 The Royal Shakespeare Company leased the building to provide them with a venue for new writing, experimental work and \\"small-scale examination of‚Ä¶classical work\\". The director was Buzz Goodbody. Later in the 1970s the Contemporary Ballet Trust established the London Contemporary Dance School and the London Contemporary Dance Theatre both of which were formed at The Place; in 1994 the latter body was succeeded by the Richard Alston Dance Company which remains located at The Place. Then in 1999 a major redevelopment programme, principally funded by the National Lottery, allowed the refurbishment of the original drill hall and the replacement of the studio block with six new state-of-the-art dance studios designed by architects Allies and Morrison. Two further dance studios, the Weston Studio and the Monument Studio, were added in 2008. From 2004 to 2013 Bloomberg sponsored The Place Prize, a large contemporary choreography competition. In September 2007, Kenneth Tharp OBE took up the new position of Chief Executive of The Place. Tharp stepped down in November 2016 and was replaced, as interim chief executive, by Steven Browning. In summer 2017 Clare Connor was permanently appointed to the post.

It was also revealed that Callely had offered to personally buy a new car for one of his civil service advisers, in an attempt to persuade the adviser not to leave their job. Callely's department had an unusually high turnover of staff for some time under his stewardship. Callely lost his seat at the 2007 general election and was also unsuccessful at the Seanad elections for the Industrial and Commercial Panel in 2007. He was subsequently appointed by the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to the Seanad. He did not contest the 2011 general election or the 2011 Seanad election. On 4 April 2011, Callely was fined ‚Ç¨60 in court for using a mobile phone while driving. Complaint to Standards Commission In 2005, the Standards in Public Office Commission received a complaint regarding an advertisement for the Operation Freeflow system which outlined traffic and travel arrangements in Dublin in the pre-Christmas period, and which featured a photograph of Callely, then Minister of State. The complainant was of the view that the Minister's appearance in the advertisement was a direct contravention of section 2.2.3 of the Code of Conduct for Office Holders as outlined above. The Standards Commission wrote to the complainant advising that they did not consider that the inclusion of a photograph of an office holder in an advertisement relating to a matter which encompassed his functions as an office holder was necessarily inappropriate. However, it also considered that the provisions of the code were insufficiently clear so as to distinguish between the appropriate use of a photograph of an office holder as part of a necessary advertising campaign and an inappropriate raising of profile in the context of a general election. The Standards Commission wrote to the Taoiseach and requested that the provisions of section 2.2.3 of the Code of Conduct for office holders be reviewed in order that office holders are provided with clear guidelines as to the circumstances in which public resources can be used in a way which avoids the inappropriate raising of profile in the context of a general election. Expenses scandal On 30 May 2010, a Freedom of Information Act request revealed Callely had claimed expenses totalling ‚Ç¨81,015 since 2007 for overnight and travel expenses to a house in County Cork. Callely said that following the loss of his D√°il seat in 2007, he took up residence in Cork. After his nomination to the Seanad, Callely informed Oireachtas officials in December 2007 that his \\"current principal residence\\" was Kilcrohane, Bantry in County Cork, which is 370 km from Leinster House. The Irish Independent reported that he was still politically active in Dublin, ran a constituency office on the northside of Dublin and attended Fianna F√°il meetings locally. Following pressure from the then Taioseach Brian Cowen, Callely resigned the Fianna F√°il party whip on 5 June 2010. He claimed a ‚Ç¨140 \\"overnight\\" allowance on hundreds of occasions when attending the Seanad ‚Äì even though he stayed in his Dublin home on the nights in question. Following further revelations about Callely's expenses in August 2010, he was suspended without prejudice from the Fianna F√°il party pending the outcome of an internal investigation. A further complaint against Callely followed later that month and he resigned from the Fianna F√°il organisation on 24 August. Arrests and conviction Callely was arrested on 25 January 2012 concerning allegations he had used forged receipts for mobile phone kits.\\"Callely arrested in probe over mobile phone receipts\\", TheJournal.ie, 25 January 2012. He was arrested again in April 2013, and taken to Clontarf Garda Station, where he was charged in connection with alleged fraud and theft offences. The charges were reported to relate to an ongoing investigation about the alleged use of false invoices to claim expenses for the purchase of mobile phones. Later that day he was charged with six counts of using fraudulent instruments in the Dublin Criminal Courts of Justice. In March 2014, Callely pleaded guilty to making false mobile phone expenses claims while a member of the Oireachtas, and was convicted in July 2014 and sentenced to 5 months in prison.\\"Ivor Callely sentenced to five months in prison\\", The Irish Times, 28 July 2014. In passing sentence, Judge Mary Ellen Ring ruled that Callely's position at the time was an aggravating factor and said that a prison term was demanded by the public interest. He served his sentence at Wheatfield Prison in Clondalkin, Dublin. Separately, on 27 April 2012, Callely was fined ‚Ç¨150 in court for driving without an NCT disc displayed. In May 2012, the Irish Independent also revealed that Callely was overpaid almost ‚Ç¨6,000 in mileage expenses while he was a Minister of State from 2004 to 2005. This error (separate to the invoice fraud) was discovered in 2010 but he had refused to pay back the money. When Callely was asked by the Department of Transport to make proposals for repayment on a goodwill basis, he replied that due to the need to devote his energy to other proceedings he was not in a position to deal with the issue at that time. In May 2016 a bench order was again issued for Callely's arrest, when he failed to attend a court sitting relating to non-payment of a debt. It was subsequently reported on Tuesday 17 May that Callely had already made arrangements to pay this debt and therefore did not need to appear in court. This was explained as a breakdown in communication. It was reported on Wednesday 18 May however that this was not the case, that there was no breakdown of communication and that no arrangements had been made to pay the debt.

Founded in 1967, and strongly influenced by the ideas of American modern and postmodern dance artists Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham, the company was probably the first contemporary dance company in the UK, and played a pioneering role in developing the art form in that country. Choreographers such as Siobhan Davies, Christopher Bannerman and Micha Bergese, worked alongside composers like Barrington Pheloung to create new works which were performed at the Sadler's Wells Theatre and toured the UK and internationally. Well-known works created by the company include: * Cell (1969) * Troy Game (1974) * Forest (1976) * Nympheas (1976) * Stabat Mater (1976) * Sphinx (1977) * Rainbow Bandit (1979) * Run Like Thunder (1983) LCDT won the 1975 Evening Standard Award for Outstanding Achievement In Ballet and Olivier Awards on three occasions: in 1978, 1989‚Äì1990 and 1994. The company closed in 1994 when The Place refocused its work, creating the Richard Alston Dance Company, and developing a bigger presenting programme for the Robin Howard Dance Theatre. London Contemporary Dance School was originally conceived to train dancers for the company, and awarded its first degree in practical dance in 1982.

Chuck Yeager was a technical consultant in the game and his digitized voice is featured in the game, giving encouragement and praise before and after missions. The game is characterized for its balance of an action laden gameplay which focuses on classical dog fights and a simple yet realistic flight model. The game was initially available for MS-DOS, and later ported to the Macintosh. The latter version is considered superior as its graphical display is at a much higher resolution, multi-player network play is supported, and saved movies may be exported in QuickTime format. Gameplay The game features three modes: Free Flight, which put the user in a selected airplane in a non-hostile environment; Create a Mission, where the user could specify which airplane to pilot against a selected number of AI-driven aircraft of varying levels of difficulty; and Historical Flight, where user could select among three wars to fly in: World War II, Korean, and Vietnam. All missions are based upon actual missions ranging from strafing attacks of World War II, the open dogfights of modern air warfare, and the combat missions of Vietnam, which included bomber escorts. The name of the actual pilot involved and the outcome of the encounter are told to the player, as a way for the player to judge air combat prowess (though it did not affect the overall scoring). This feature separated the game from other similar games of its time, and influenced future work on later flight simulations. However, large, famous battles in the wars are not included (for example, there are no D-Day, Pearl Harbor, or Battle of Britain missions). For World War II, the missions are based solely on the European Theater of Operations. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1991 said that Chuck Yeagers graphics and flight models impressed a Vietnam War combat pilot, and predicted that it would be \\"popular with both flight sim veterans and newcomers\\". A survey in the magazine that year of strategy and war games gave it four and a half stars out of five, a 1993 survey in the magazine of wargames gave the game three-plus stars. and a 1994 survey gave the Macintosh version (\\"a few minor improvements\\") four stars out of five. In 1994, the magazine stated that Hellcats Over the Pacific and F/A-18 Hornet had better graphics on the Macintosh but Chuck Yeager flying was more realistic, despite the lack of a rudder. The magazine concluded that it \\"is worth a test flight, especially for we Mac-types who must live on a thin diet of top-flight games\\". In 1996, the magazine ranked it as the 35th best PC game of all time. In 1994, PC Gamer US named Air Combat the 9th best computer game ever. The editors wrote, \\"It may not have the most realistic flight models in the world, and the plane and ground graphics show their age, but there's no denying that Chuck Yeager's Air Combat succeeds wildly where it counts most ‚Äî in creating a realistic sense of flight.\\" That same year, PC Gamer UK named it the 47th best computer game of all time, writing that it \\"offers the perfect hour or two of dogfighting.\\" In 1998, PC Gamer declared it the 23rd-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \\"classic\\" and a \\"golden oldie\\".

He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Wexford constituency from 1982 to 2016. He is a former Minister of State. His most recent role was as Minister of State with special responsibility for Fisheries at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (2007‚Äì2008). Early and private life John Browne was born in Marshalstown, County Wexford in 1948. He was educated locally at St Mary's Christian Brothers School in Enniscorthy. Browne worked as a salesman before becoming involved in politics and was also an inter-county hurler for Wexford. Browne is married to Judy and they have three children, a fourth child now deceased. His uncle Se√°n Browne, was also a TD, who was first elected in 1957. He retired due to ill health. John Browne topped the poll in the constituency of Wexford on a number of occasions. Political career Browne first became involved in politics in 1979 when he was elected to Enniscorthy Urban District Council and to Wexford County Council. Browne was first elected to D√°il √âireann at the November 1982 general election for the constituency of Wexford and has been re-elected at every election since. Over his career Browne has held a number of government and opposition positions. Not long after his election he was appointed assistant Chief Whip. When Fianna F√°il returned to power in 1987 he remained on the backbenches however. The election of Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach in 1992 saw Browne become Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food with special responsibility for the Food Industry. In 1993 he was moved to the post of Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with special responsibility for Environmental Protection, serving in that position until 1994. In 1997 Fianna F√°il were back in power, however, Browne remained on the backbenches. In 2002 he received a promotion to the post of Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In Bertie Ahern's Cabinet reshuffle of 2004 Browne became Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, serving under Mary Coughlan, Ireland's first female Agriculture Minister. Following a junior ministerial reshuffle in February 2006 Browne returned to his previous department, where he served as Minister of State with responsibility for the Marine. Browne has also served as Chairman of a number of Oireachtas Committees, including, Agriculture, Marine, Social Affairs, and Finance. After the 2007 general election, he was appointed as Minister of State for Fisheries, the office was previously known as Minister of State with special responsibility for the Marine. On 13 May 2008, shortly after Brian Cowen became Taoiseach, Browne lost his position as Minister of State for Fisheries in a major re-shuffle by the new leader - he was not appointed to any other junior ministry. He is currently the Fianna F√°il spokesperson on Marine and Fisheries. Browne was involved in controversy in November 2011 when it emerged that the Department of Public Expenditure incorrectly paid him a pension from his time as a junior minister at the Department of Agriculture worth ‚Ç¨7,396.31 despite still being a sitting TD. The Department of public expenditure apologised to the TD for the embarrassment caused to him. He did not contest the 2016 general election, and his son James Browne was elected in his place.

The show debuted on September 9, 1967, on CBS. Hanna-Barbera produced one season for the original airing of the show, although the original 18 episodes were rerun during the 1968‚Äì69 television season, with The Herculoids ending its run on September 6, 1969. Eleven new episodes were produced in 1981 as part of the Space Stars show. The plotlines are rooted in science fiction, and have story direction and content similar to Jonny Quest and Space Ghost. In the show, the space barbarian family Zandor, Tara and son Dorno fight alongside their giant pets the Herculoids ‚Äî laser dragon Zok, space rhinoceros Tundro, rock ape Igoo and the shape-shifting Gloop and his son Gleep ‚Äî to keep their planet safe from invading robots, mad scientists and mutants. The diverse team fought an endless battle against a stream of villains including, according to Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, \\"the Faceless People, Destroyer Ants, Raider Apes, Mutoids, Arnoids, Zorbots, the Mekkano mechanical men and the Ogs, a strange form of vegetable life.\\" This series is set on the distant planet Amzot (renamed Quasar in the later series Space Stars, with which it otherwise shared a continuity). The name \\"Amzot\\" was first mentioned in the Space Ghost episode \\"The Molten Monsters of Moltar\\" (in which the Herculoids made a brief guest appearance) and in the series proper in the \\"Time Creatures\\" episode. Characters There are eight regular characters who make up the Herculoids: =The Herculoids= Humans The three humans were the only ones who could communicate in English. * Zandor (voiced by Mike Road) - The protector of Amzot/Quasar, and leader of The Herculoids. * Tara (voiced by Virginia Gregg) - Zandor's wife. * Dorno (voiced by Ted Eccles in the original series, Sparky Marcus in 1981) - Son of Zandor and Tara. Despite being their son, he still refers to them by their first names, rather than \\"Mother\\" and \\"Father.\\" However, this changed in the 1980s revival of the series. Creatures The five creature characters of The Herculoids are: * Zok (voiced by Mike Road) - A bat-winged laser dragon. He can emit laser beams from his eyes and tail. His eyes also produce a \\"nega-beam\\" that can neutralize certain energy attacks. Zok can survive in space unaided, is capable of interstellar travel, and can also breathe fire. * Igoo (voiced by Mike Road) - A rock ape. An extremely large and powerful simian, he has extremely dense rocklike skin and is nearly invulnerable to harm. In one episode, Igoo wades through a pond of molten lava. Igoo has a kind and gentle temperament as well as a great fondness and devotion for Tara, and would do anything for her. * Tundro (voiced by Mike Road) - A 10-legged, four-horned rhinoceros/Triceratops hybrid. He can shoot explosive energy rocks from his cannon-horn (Zandor, Tara, and Dorno also occasionally shoot similar rocks with slingshots). His natural armor-plating is exceptionally strong, similar to Igoo's rock skin. His legs have the ability to extend to a remarkable length, somewhat like stilts. He can also spin his head at blinding speed, allowing him to drill through solid rock, and has the ability to make magnificent leaps. * Gloop and Gleep (both voiced by Don Messick) - Two protoplasmic creatures. They are able to absorb and deflect energy blasts and laser beams, often placing themselves between attackers and other Herculoids to act as shields. They can also form shapes including, but not limited to: cushions, trampolines or parachutes to break falls; stretching themselves between tree limbs or rocks to act as slingshots; encircling an attacker's limbs to restrain them, or the entire body to squeeze and render them unconscious. Gloop is the larger of the two and Gleep is the smaller. Legacy After its initial run, The Herculoids was featured in several anthology wheel series produced by Hanna-Barbara including Hanna‚ÄìBarbera's World of Super Adventure, Space Stars (for which 11 additional episodes were created), and both the Cartoon Network and Boomerang incarnations of Super Adventures. The series has also influenced other artists of various mediums. Award-winning video game designer David Crane has stated that he enjoyed the series as a child and that the character of Blobert from the A Boy and His Blob franchise was directly inspired by Gloop and Gleep. Jamaican American DJ DJ Kool Herc at one time employed a backing band which also drew its name from the show, fictionalized versions of which appear in the Netflix period series The Get Down. =Cameos= Roughly contemporaneous to their own series premiere, the Herculoids made an appearance in an episode of Space Ghost, \\"The Molten Monsters of Moltar\\" (sources are unclear and/or inconsistent as to exact airdates). In the \\"Council of Doom\\" story arc, Space Ghost, while battling the combined might of all of his enemies, meets a number of Hanna- Barbera heroes just as they were debuting in their own respective series. Along with the Herculoids were Shazzan, Moby Dick and the Mighty Mightor, the last two sharing one series. Several episodes of Space Ghost Coast to Coast mention or show the Herculoids. In \\"Lawsuit\\", Space Ghost mentions the Herculoids' planet. In the episode \\"Sequel\\", he goes to their planet and refers to it as a \\"rotten hippie monster commune\\" after they demand he leave while pelting him with stones.Ghost Planet Central Gloop is mentioned by name and features prominently in the Sealab 2021 episode \\"Hail, Squishface\\". Gloop makes several guest appearances on Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law as well. Gleep is mentioned at one point but he does make cameos in \\"Mindless\\" and \\"Juror in Court\\", and Zok makes an appearance in \\"Peanut Puberty\\" (Phil Ken Sebben throws a graph chart at him). Tundro makes an appearance in \\"Beyond the Valley of the Dinosaurs\\" firing his energy rocks at Phil Ken Sebben, who forgot to close the hot tub time portal to prehistoric times, and Tara appears on the evolution chart in between Fred Flintstone and Race Bannon in \\"Evolutionary War\\". The Herculoids is mentioned in an episode of The Venture Bros., where an old \\"fan letter\\" of Dr. Venture to the show is discovered. Upon reading, the letter is revealed to be more akin to hate mail; young Rusty Venture called the Herculoids hippies for not fighting in Vietnam. Tundro and Gloop appear in an episode of Family Guy, \\"8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter\\". In the scene, Gloop fails to get a babysitting job from Lois. In protest, Tundro shows up and fires his energy rocks at Lois. Gloop and Gleep appeared in a cameo as captured prisoners of a hostile alien race in the Dexter's Laboratory episode \\"Mis-Placed in Space\\". The Herculoids appear in issue 50 of New Mutants when Professor X is searching for Magik on a planet in the Shi'ar galaxy.

The adjective \\"gravitational\\" is derived from the symmetry of a gravitational theory, namely from general covariance. A gravitational anomaly is generally synonymous with diffeomorphism anomaly, since general covariance is symmetry under coordinate reparametrization; i.e. diffeomorphism. General covariance is the basis of general relativity, the classical theory of gravitation. Moreover, it is necessary for the consistency of any theory of quantum gravity, since it is required in order to cancel unphysical degrees of freedom with a negative norm, namely gravitons polarized along the time direction. Therefore, all gravitational anomalies must cancel out. The anomaly usually appears as a Feynman diagram with a chiral fermion running in the loop (a polygon) with n external gravitons attached to the loop where n=1+D/2 where D is the spacetime dimension.  Gravitational anomalies  Consider a classical gravitational field represented by the vielbein e^a_{\\\\;\\\\mu} and a quantized Fermi field \\\\psi. The generating functional for this quantum field is Z[e^a_{\\\\;\\\\mu}]=e^{-W[e^a_{\\\\;\\\\mu}]}=\\\\int d\\\\bar{\\\\psi}d\\\\psi\\\\;\\\\; e^{-\\\\int d^4x e \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\psi}}, where W is the quantum action and the e factor before the Lagrangian is the vielbein determinant, the variation of the quantum action renders \\\\delta W[e^a_{\\\\;\\\\mu}]=\\\\int d^4x \\\\; e \\\\langle T^\\\\mu_{\\\\;a}\\\\rangle \\\\delta e^a_{\\\\;\\\\mu} in which we denote a mean value with respect to the path integral by the bracket \\\\langle\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\rangle.

He has been a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Cavan‚ÄìMonaghan constituency since 1992. He previously served as Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade from 2016 to 2020, Minister for Justice and Law Reform from January 2011 to March 2011, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 2008 to 2011, Minister of State for Children from 2007 to 2008 and Minister of State for Food, Forestry and Horticulture from 2004 to 2007. Early Life Born in Cavan in 1956, Smith was educated at Bawnboy National School, St. Camillus College, Killucan, County Westmeath, and University College, Dublin, where he gained a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Economics. For 15 years he worked as special advisor to the Fianna F√°il politician and former T√°naiste, John Wilson. Political Career Smith was first elected to D√°il √âireann at the 1992 general election for the Cavan‚ÄìMonaghan constituency and has been re- elected at every subsequent election since. In the 28th D√°il, he was Government Whip on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. In Bertie Ahern's 2004 cabinet reshuffle, Smith was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food with special responsibility for Food and Horticulture. Following the 2007 general election, Smith became Minister of State for Children, succeeding Brian Lenihan Jnr in that position. On 7 May 2008, he was appointed as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Brian Cowen's cabinet. In July 2010, Smith launched the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. Its overall target to increase the value of Ireland's agri-food and fisheries exports by ‚Ç¨5bn to reach ‚Ç¨12bn by 2020. A September 2012 progress report on the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, found that farmers and other primary producers had passed the halfway mark towards meeting their 2020 targets. In 2010, during his term as Minister for Agriculture, he offered free cheese to Ireland's poor via a European Union scheme that had been around since the 1980s. The public received Smith's announcement poorly and it was reported outside Ireland as the country became \\"a laughing stock internationally\\".> Smith was then forced to defend his own scheme. Following the resignation of Dermot Ahern from the cabinet in January 2011, Smith was also appointed as Minister for Justice and Law Reform. Just before leaving office, Smith gave the go-ahead for genetically modified organism (GMO) foods to enter Ireland.

Treiman, Sam, and Roman Jackiw, (2014). Current algebra and anomalies. Princeton University Press. All gauge anomalies must cancel out. Anomalies in gauge symmetries lead to an inconsistency, since a gauge symmetry is required in order to cancel degrees of freedom with a negative norm which are unphysical (such as a photon polarized in the time direction). Indeed, cancellation occurs in the Standard Model. The term gauge anomaly is usually used for vector gauge anomalies. Another type of gauge anomaly is the gravitational anomaly, because coordinate reparametrization (called a diffeomorphism) is the gauge symmetry of gravitation. Calculation of the anomaly Anomalies occur only in even spacetime dimensions. For example, the anomalies in the usual 4 spacetime dimensions arise from triangle Feynman diagrams. =Vector gauge anomalies= In vector gauge anomalies (in gauge symmetries whose gauge boson is a vector), the anomaly is a chiral anomaly, and can be calculated exactly at one loop level, via a Feynman diagram with a chiral fermion running in the loop with n external gauge bosons attached to the loop where n=1+D/2 where D is the spacetime dimension. Image:Triangle diagram.svg Let us look at the (semi)effective action we get after integrating over the chiral fermions. If there is a gauge anomaly, the resulting action will not be gauge invariant. If we denote by \\\\delta_\\\\epsilon the operator corresponding to an infinitesimal gauge transformation by Œµ, then the Frobenius consistency condition requires that :\\\\left[\\\\delta_{\\\\epsilon_1},\\\\delta_{\\\\epsilon_2}\\\\right]\\\\mathcal{F}=\\\\delta_{\\\\left[\\\\epsilon_1,\\\\epsilon_2\\\\right]}\\\\mathcal{F} for any functional \\\\mathcal{F}, including the (semi)effective action S where [,] is the Lie bracket. As \\\\delta_\\\\epsilon S is linear in Œµ, we can write :\\\\delta_\\\\epsilon S=\\\\int_{M^d} \\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\epsilon) where Œ©(d) is d-form as a functional of the nonintegrated fields and is linear in Œµ. Let us make the further assumption (which turns out to be valid in all the cases of interest) that this functional is local (i.e. Œ©(d)(x) only depends upon the values of the fields and their derivatives at x) and that it can be expressed as the exterior product of p-forms. If the spacetime Md is closed (i.e. without boundary) and oriented, then it is the boundary of some d+1 dimensional oriented manifold Md+1. If we then arbitrarily extend the fields (including Œµ) as defined on Md to Md+1 with the only condition being they match on the boundaries and the expression Œ©(d), being the exterior product of p-forms, can be extended and defined in the interior, then :\\\\delta_\\\\epsilon S=\\\\int_{M^{d+1}} d\\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\epsilon). The Frobenius consistency condition now becomes :\\\\left[\\\\delta_{\\\\epsilon_1},\\\\delta_{\\\\epsilon_2}\\\\right]S=\\\\int_{M^{d+1}}\\\\left[\\\\delta_{\\\\epsilon_1}d\\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\epsilon_2)-\\\\delta_{\\\\epsilon_2}d\\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\epsilon_1)\\\\right]=\\\\int_{M^{d+1}}d\\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\left[\\\\epsilon_1,\\\\epsilon_2\\\\right]). As the previous equation is valid for any arbitrary extension of the fields into the interior, :\\\\delta_{\\\\epsilon_1}d\\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\epsilon_2)-\\\\delta_{\\\\epsilon_2}d\\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\epsilon_1)=d\\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\left[\\\\epsilon_1,\\\\epsilon_2\\\\right]). Because of the Frobenius consistency condition, this means that there exists a d+1-form Œ©(d+1) (not depending upon Œµ) defined over Md+1 satisfying :\\\\delta_\\\\epsilon \\\\Omega^{(d+1)}=d\\\\Omega^{(d)}( \\\\epsilon ). Œ©(d+1) is often called a Chern-Simons form. Once again, if we assume Œ©(d+1) can be expressed as an exterior product and that it can be extended into a d+1 -form in a d+2 dimensional oriented manifold, we can define :\\\\Omega^{(d+2)}=d\\\\Omega^{(d+1)} in d+2 dimensions. Œ©(d+2) is gauge invariant: :\\\\delta_\\\\epsilon \\\\Omega^{(d+2)}=d\\\\delta_\\\\epsilon \\\\Omega^{(d+1)}=d^2\\\\Omega^{(d)}(\\\\epsilon)=0 as d and Œ¥Œµ commute. =Gravitational anomalies= See also *chiral gauge theory References Anomalies in physics ","title":"Gauge anomaly"},{"id":"1372456","text":"Glenbrook South High School, or GBS, is a public four-year high school located in Glenview, Illinois, a north suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. It is part of Northfield Township High School District, which also includes Glenbrook North High School. Glenbrook South should not be confused with Glenbard South High School, another suburban Chicago high school located in Glen Ellyn, Illinois that is also referred to as \\"GBS\\". Feeder schools that attend GBS are Attea, Springman, Field (Glenview portions), and Maple (Glenview portions). According to state standardized test scores, 29% of students are at least proficient in math and 40% in reading, as tested by the Illinois State Board of Education. These figures indicate that the schools performance is above the state high school median of 24% proficiency in Math and Reading. History In 1962, due to overcrowding at Glenbrook North, Glenbrook South High School was established. It underwent a dramatic expansion in 2002 adding dozens of classrooms, revamping the music and performing art facilities, and reconfiguring the parking lots and athletics fields. During the summer of 2007, Glenbrook South updated six science classrooms from the 1960s and reconfigured two others to create full-size science classrooms. The Dean's Office, and Student Activities Office were also renovated. A new Food Court was constructed along with a Student Activities Center that was created by reconfiguring the faculty lounge. Construction at GBS was completed with the addition of a practice gym, which increased PE capacity and a new pool with handicapped access, eight lane capacity and a diving depth of fourteen feet. A new fitness center opened in May 2008 and the former weight room was converted into two health classrooms, a driver education classroom and a Health/Driver Education office. Today, Glenbrook South High School, along with Glenbrook North, are noted for their outstanding curriculum and quality of education, having been repeatedly named to a variety of best-in-the-nation lists. For example, as part of the First in the World Consortium, GBS and GBN students scored first in the world in international math & science testing. Academics In 2008, Glenbrook South had an average composite ACT score of 24.3, and graduated 99.6% of its senior class. Glenbrook South did not make Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, a state test part of the No Child Left Behind Act. According to 2019 statistics, Glenbrook South was ranked 12th in terms of the best high schools in the state of Illinois. Of the roughly 3000 students who attend GBS, roughly 42% are from minority groups. Students represent these categories: 2.4% African American, 11.3% Hispanic, 0.1% American Indian, 18.1% Asian, 65.2% white, 22.1% financially disadvantaged students. Students have a State Test Performance Index of 97.9 and a Poverty-Adjustment Performance Index of 1.55. The Disadvantaged Students' State Test Proficiency Rate is 38.3 with a Disadvantaged Students Performance Gap of 11.0, while the Non-disadvantaged Students' State Test Proficiency Rate is 71.6 and Current State Test Achievement Gap is 33.3. In College-Ready Student Performance, the College Readiness Index is 43.5, participation rate is 46.8%, Quality Adjusted Participation rate is 42.4%, Participant Passing Rate is 90.6%, and Exam Passing rate is 92.0%. Advanced Placement student performance is reflected in an AP Participation Rate of 46.8%, a Quality Adjusted Participation rate of 42.4%, a Participant Passing Rate of 90.6%, and Exam Passing rate of 92.0%. The Federal No Child Left Behind Act as applied in Illinois requires 100% of students to meet standards on the Prairie State Achievement Exam by 2013. Glenbrook South High School continues to focus curricular efforts on academic growth for each student. These efforts focus on the meaningful implementation of the [College Readiness Standards] http://www.act.org/standard/ from ACT.

Currently it is a city of regional significance in the Sumy region of Ukraine, just south of the Russian border. Hlukhiv is administratively incorporated as a city of oblast significance. Hlukhiv Municipality includes Hlukhiv and the village of Sliporod. Hlukhiv also serves as administrative center of Hlukhiv Raion but does not belong to the raion. Population: It is known for being a capital of the Cossack Hetmanate after deposition of Ivan Mazepa in 1708‚Äì1764. The former Soviet Chervone-Pustohorod air base is located near Hlukhiv.  History  Coat of arms of Hlukhiv Regiment in 1663‚Äì65, a province of Cossack Hetmanate First noticed by chroniclers as a Severian town in 1152. Sometime in 1247 Hlukhiv became the seat of a branch of the princely house of Chernigov following the Mongol invasion of Rus. Between 1320 and 1503 it was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania before being conquered by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1618 it became part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (in the Czernih√≥w Voivodeship of the Crown of Poland) and was granted Magdeburg Rights in 1644 by W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa. In 1648‚Äì1764 it was part of the Cossack Hetmanate within the Nizhyn Regiment (province). In 1654 the Cossack Hetmanate came under military protectorate of the Tsardom of Muscovy in accordance with the Treaty of Pereyaslav and in 1664, during the siege of Hlukhiv, the Russo-Cossack garrison of the town successfully defended against a superiour Polish army which suffered great losses during the following retreat. According to the Truce of Andrusovo along with the rest Left-bank Ukraine it was ceded to the Tsardom of Muscovy in 1667. In 1708 after realizing that Ivan Mazepa sided with Carl XII, Peter the Great order to destroy Baturyn and transfer capital to Hlukhiv. Here in November 1708 was elected a new Hetman of Zaporizhian Host Ivan Skoropadsky, while the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Halych and all Little Russia Ioasaf was forced to proclaim anathema onto Mazepa in the St. Trinity Cathedral (destroyed in 1962). Hlukhiv served as the capital of the Cossack Hetmanate in 1708-64 and until 1773 the administrative center of the Little Russia Governorate. Under the last hetmans of Ukraine, the town was remodeled in the Baroque style. Subsequently, it declined in consequence of frequent fires, so that very few of its architectural gems survived. Since the first school of singing in the Russian Empire was established there in 1738, the town has a rich musical heritage. Composers Dmytro Bortniansky and Maksym Berezovsky, whose statues grace the Bortniansky Square of Hlukhiv, are believed to have studied there. In 1874 in Hlukhiv was established a college (today Hlukhiv National Pedagogical University of Oleksandr Dovzhenko). In 1879 Russian millionaires of Ukrainian descent Tereshchenko brothers established a free hospital of St. Euphrosyne and supported it financially. In 1899 on the funds of Tereshchenko family in Hlukhiv was established another college (today Agrarian college of the Sumy Agrarian University). In 1918 the city became part of Ukraine, however already in January 1918 it was occupied by the Soviet troops for several months. The Soviet regime returned again to the city a year later in 1919. During World War II, Hlukhiv was occupied by the German Army from 9 September 1941 to 30 August 1943. In 1994 in the city was established the State Historical and Cultural Heritage Park. In October 2015 at the local election, the mayor of the city became , a naturalized Ukrainian from France and great grandson of Mikhail Tereshchenko. Tereshchenko stepped down as mayor in October 2018 with the intention to become a candidate in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election.Hlukhiv mayor steps down to run for president, LB.ua (1 October 2018) Yet, during the November‚ÄìDecember 30 days martial law in Ukraine he resumed his position as mayor and on 3 January 2019 he declared his support for (another) presidential candidate Andriy Sadovyi during a congress of Sadovyi's party Self Reliance. Tereshchenko supported Sadovyi's candidacy for the presidency by Ukrayinska Pravda (3 January 2019)  Sights  The oldest building in the town is the church of St. Nicholas (1693), modeled after traditional wooden churches and executed in the Ukrainian Baroque style. The church, repaired and renovated in 1871, has three pear-shaped domes and a two-storey bell tower. The church of the Savior's Transfiguration (1765) straddles the line between Baroque and Neoclassicism, while the massive Neo-Byzantine cathedral (1884‚Äì93) resembles St Volodymyr's Cathedral in Kyiv. Probably the best known landmark of modern Hlukhiv is the conspicuous water tower (1927‚Äì29), though more historical interest attaches to the triumphal arch, dated either to 1744 or 1766. It has been suggested that the architect of this rather plain structure was Andrey Kvasov. The arch, the oldest in Ukraine, sustained damage during World War II but was subsequently restored. Religion Most dominant religious presentation in the city has the Russian Orthodox Church through the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). Near Hlukhiv in the village of Sosnivka is located a small monastery (Russian Orthodox Church) Glinsk Hermitage.  Agricultural research  Due to the traditional cultivation of industrial hemp in the area, Hlukhiv has become home to the Institute of Bast Crops of the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences, working on breeding improved hemp and flax cultivars. In the 1970s, the institute developed low-THC hemp varieties for industrial cultivation.Hemp will help Ukraine to grow wealthy Interview with Dr. V. G.

The game is a first person shooter with a variety of weapons and levels, but has a hillbilly theme, primarily taking place in a fictional Arkansas town. Many of the weapons and power-ups border on the nonsensical, and in some ways the game is a parody of both first shooter games and rural American life. It features music by psychobilly and cowpunk artists such as The Beat Farmers and Mojo Nixon. The game has been re- released on GOG.com and Steam with support for Windows and macOS.  Gameplay  Redneck Rampage is a first-person shooter and offers a variety of ways for the character to regenerate health or hit points. These power-ups consist of moon pies, pork rinds, and alcohol. A small supply of each can be carried for future use (the two exceptions being pork rinds and Delicious Googoo Clusters, which were used automatically upon being picked up). Each of these power-ups had distinct disadvantages: The more food the character ate, the more flatulent he became (represented by a \\"gut\\" meter in the user display), making it difficult to sneak up on enemies as the character would move forward and make a distinct fart sound frequently after eating. However, eating food did decrease the \\"drunk meter\\" slightly (see below). When drinking alcohol, the health was restored and as an added benefit the character became somewhat less affected by enemy fire. This only worked to a minor degree, and the more the character drank, the less coordinated he became. Alcohol consumption was measured on a \\"drunk meter\\" in the user display. After consuming a large amount of alcohol, the character's movements would become erratic and the user would have difficulty controlling the character as he moved in directions that did not correspond to the input on the keyboard. The in-game video would also become grainy and less viewable. At the maximum drunk level, the character would simply fall down, followed by the sounds of vomiting and the loss of all motor regardless of user input. All of these effects would pass after a few minutes as the character sobered up. During this time, the character could use weapons and was essentially defenseless. The side effects of both power-up types forced the user to use them sparingly and gave another reason to avoid damage during gameplay. However, one other power-up, moonshine, gave the player increased speed for a brief amount of time, at the end of which both the \\"drunk meter\\" and the \\"gut meter\\" were reset to zero.  Plot  The game's plot revolves around two brothers, Leonard and Bubba, fighting through the fictional town of Hickston, Arkansas to rescue their prized pig Bessie and thwart an alien invasion. The brothers battle through such locales as a meat packing plant and a trailer park, and battle evil clones of their neighbors. There are also male and female alien enemies. The bosses are the Assface and the leader of the alien invasion, the Queen Vixen. Add-ons and spin-offs =Redneck Rampage: Suckin' Grits on Route 66= Redneck Rampage: Suckin' Grits on Route 66 is a 12-level expansion pack for Redneck Rampage. It was developed by Sunstorm Interactive. The add-on contains several new locations and textures, as well as a new ending. =Redneck Deer Huntin'= Redneck Deer Huntin' is a hunting game for the PC using the same engine as the previous games in the series. It was developed by Xatrix Entertainment and released in 1997. =Redneck Rampage Rides Again= Redneck Rampage Rides Again is the sequel to Redneck Rampage, and includes 14 new single player levels, 7 new multiplayer levels, new enemies, weapons, and vehicles, including motorcycles and swamp boats. After Leonard and Bubba crash-land a UFO, they find themselves in the middle of the desert (Area 69). Along the way, they are hunted by aliens and must blast their way through jackalope farms, Disgraceland, a riverboat, a brothel and various other locales. It was developed by Xatrix Entertainment and released on May 31, 1998. =Off-Road Redneck Racing= Off-Road Redneck Racing is a spin-off racing game released in 2001 for the PC. Unlike the previous games, it was not developed by Xatrix, instead by Rage Games; however, Interplay remained the owner of the IP, and thus they published it. Besides the game's namesake, the only relation to the previous games are of Leonard and Bubba on the box art, borrowed voice lines of Leonard from the original games sporadically used during a race, and slightly similar textures being used on some artwork and also in-game. This is the first and only game in the series not to use the Build game engine. = Compilations/Demos = *The Cuss Pack is an add-on which added stronger language to the game, was released on July 22, 1997. The add-on was available for download on Interplay's online store, but users had to pay $1 with a credit card to ensure that the buyer of the add-on was of adult age.

Reception  In the United States, Redneck Rampage debuted at #7 on PC Data's computer game sales chart for May 1997. It claimed 13th place the following month, before falling to positions 17 and 20 in July and August, respectively. Reviews for the title were mixed, but even the harshest reviewers were able to appreciate the game's energy and sense of humor. Arinn Dembo writing for Cnet Gamecenter gave the game three stars, and said it deserved \\"big points for its psychobilly soundtrack\\", \\"big points for being genuinely funny at times\\", and offered \\"good fun using a crowbar to beat aliens, 'Old Coots' and 'Billy Rays' to death\\". Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"As creative as much of this game is, its gameplay is same-old, same-old. It's fun, but when it's over, you're more likely to remember the 'Yee-has' and health-replenishing whisky bottles instead of any of the challenge or gameplay.\\" Redneck Rampage was nominated in the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' first annual Interactive Achievement Awards in the category \\"Computer Action Game of the Year\\".

Development John Fishwick & Sons pre-production Titan in the 1980s Reading Transport Titan in July 2008 Wiltax Titan with the rare Park Royal bodywork in April 2007 Greater Manchester Transport Titan in October 2009 Stagecoach in East Kent's preserved Titan in April 2009, this was the final Titan built in November 1984 Big Bus Company open-top Titan in May 2006 The Titan was conceived in 1973 as project B15 and was intended as a replacement for the Bristol VRT, Daimler Fleetline and Leyland Atlantean. Following the success of the single-decker Leyland National, it was decided, from the outset, that the vehicle would be very standardised and of integral construction. This allowed more flexibility in the location of mechanical components and allowed a reduced step-height. The move away from body-on-chassis construction caused concern for the bodybuilders, who had already lost market share to the Leyland National. Talks regarding licensing agreements were held with Alexander and Northern Counties, both major suppliers to their respective local markets, but no agreements were reached. Leyland saw London Transport (LT) as a major market, so the specification was heavily influenced by their preferences. LT was suffering problems with its Daimler/Leyland Fleetline one-person-operated double-deckers and wanted more input into the design. Leyland, too wanted to gain more operator input than had been the case with the Leyland National. Five prototypes (B15.01-B15.05) were constructed between 1975 and 1977, two of which were evaluated in London.Leyland Titan Bus Lists on the Web Specification The Titan was long, wide and high. The main body structure was aluminium and the body was assembled using Avdel 'Avdelok' rivets similar to the Leyland National. Single and dual-door layouts were offered, with a number of options for the location of the staircase. Mechanically, independent front suspension and a drop-centre rear axle were used, with air suspension and power hydraulic brakes as standard. The prototype engine was a turbocharged version of the Leyland 500 series, although this was changed to Gardner 6LXB for production, as a result of customer preference and concerns over fuel economy and reliability of the 500 series. The Leyland TL11 engine was available for later production versions. The engine was mounted vertically at the rear, with the radiator located separately in a compartment above the engine. This led to an unusual off-centre square rear window. The overall design was advanced for the time and improved on noise and emission requirements by considerable margins. Production The Titan name, previously used for a front-engined double-decker, was revived for production in June 1977. It was intended that Park Royal Vehicles would build the first 100 vehicles, with production then transferring to AEC in Southall. This caused industrial relations problems at Park Royal and some 200 skilled craftspeople left. Production was very slow and the first vehicle was not delivered until August 1978. In October 1978, Leyland announced the AEC factory would close, with the intention of keeping Titan production at Park Royal. The very slow production rate continued, causing cancellation of a number of existing orders. The industrial relations problems continued, as Leyland sought to replace the skilled staff, who had left, with semi-skilled workers. Finally, Leyland announced in October 1979 that Park Royal would close in May 1980.Park Royal closure: Titan future assured Commercial Motor 26 October 1979 Once this decision had been made and a productivity-related redundancy package negotiated, production increased dramatically. Whereas Park Royal had taken 14 months to build the first 100 vehicles, it took just seven months to build the final 150. Efforts to transfer production to Eastern Coach Works in Lowestoft failed, again due to difficult industrial relations, so it was finally decided that production would recommence at an expanded facility in Workington, which also built the Leyland National.Leyalnd's hiccup Commercial Motor 2 February 1980On-off Titan is off but not finished yet Commercial Motor 16 February 1980Titan gets the kiss of life in Cumbria Commercial Motor 5 April 1980 It took almost a year to expand the facility, transfer the jigs and tooling from Park Royal and recommence production. The continued delays caused the loss of further orders. Besides the production difficulties, other aspects of the Titan specification, which was strongly influenced by London Transport, were unpopular. Power hydraulic brakes, a fixed height of and an inability to specify local bodywork all limited the Titan's appeal. Outside London, the Greater Manchester PTE bought 15 (against an original order of 190) and the West Midlands PTE bought five (against an original order of 80) which were later sold to London Transport. The first deliveries for each operator were displayed at the 1978 British Motor Show at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. Reading Transport bought two Park Royal Titans to full London specification and a further 10 from Workington, five of which had high-ratio rear axles and coach seats for express services into London. However planned orders for Greater Glasgow PTE, Lothian Regional Transport, Maidstone & District, Merseyside Transport, Southend Transport and Tyne & Wear Transport were eventually cancelled and simply never got built due to these delays. One was exported to Hong Kong and entered service with China Motor Bus. A long version of the Titan had been planned for this operator but that too was cancelled as a result of the difficulties at Park Royal and two Leyland Victory Mark 2s were built instead. A demonstrator, built in 1982, failed to secure any further orders, operators preferring the flexibility and lower cost of the Leyland Olympian. This vehicle was eventually sold to a Scottish independent operator, Ian Glass of Haddington. London's orders were split between the Titan and the MCW Metrobus but production of Titan for London alone was proving uneconomic. Strong pressure was brought to bear to increase the Titan share of the London orders. As a result, Leyland received the entire order for 275 vehicles in 1982. This led to layoffs at Metro Cammell Weymann. The 1983 order also favoured Leyland, with 210 Titan and 150 Metrobuses. The decision was made to end production, upon completion of a final batch of 240 ordered in 1984,LT kills off Titan...and ECW? Commercial Motor 2 July 1983 with Leyland focusing on the Olympian. In London The orders from London Transport were as follows: *1979: 100 (T1‚Äì100) *1980: 150 (T101‚Äì250) ‚Äî reduced from 250 due to industrial relations difficulties at Park RoyalLT's new generation Commercial Motor 20 April 1979 *1981: 150 (T251‚Äì400) *1982: 275 (T401‚Äì675) *1983: 210 (T676‚Äì885) *1984: 240 (T886‚Äì1125) The first production Titans were delivered in August 1978 and entered service at Hornchurch in December 1978 on routes 165, 246 and 252. The Titan's London Transport service career saw it working in the eastern and south eastern half of the capital, though a surplus of the type following tendering reverses in the later 1980s, saw Titans spread to some north London garages. Withdrawals began in December 1992, with large numbers passing to other operators. The most significant user of former London Titans was Merseyside's largest bus operator Merseybus who entered into an agreement with London Buses to purchase 250 from the end of 1992 to 1994. Many of these were extensively refurbished and replaced time expired Leyland Atlantean's within the Merseybus fleet which by the mid-1990s were over 20 years old. Initially concentrated at the Merseybus depot at Gillmoss in North Liverpool parent company MTL Trust Holdings Ltd also transferred ex-London Titans to Merseyside from its MTL London division and ultimately approximately 400 ex-London Titans came to Merseyside with Merseybus and the other companies within MTL as well as many other bus companies within the Merseyside region like Aintree Coachlines, Avon Buses, GTL, Liverpool City Coaches/Citybus, Merseyline Travel and Village Group. A few of these Merseyside operators also used ex-Greater Manchester and West Midlands Titans as well and Village Group also operated the B15 prototype NHG732P for a brief period during 1997-98 before being acquired by MTL in 1998. Other users of ex-London Titans around this time included Oxford Bus Company and Kinchbus. Further buses remained on London work under the ownership of independent contractors such as London Suburban Buses, London & Country, BTS and London Coaches (later Atlas Bus). One of the final Titan deliveries, fleet T990, was destroyed in the Aldwych bus bombing in 1996. Upon the privatisation of the London Buses subsidiaries, the remaining Titans were distributed between London Central, Stagecoach East London and Stagecoach Selkent. The latter pair began cascading their Titans away almost immediately, spreading them throughout the country. Stagecoach East London's last Titans were withdrawn in September 2001 and Selkent's in November 2001, leaving London Central with a small number of spare buses which were eventually whittled down. Amid a small ceremony, the last one, T1018 was retired from route 40 on 19 June 2003.London's Leyland Titan Breathes its Last London Bus Page 19 June 2003 Titans today In London, the low emission zone saw the last Blue Triangle and Sullivan Buses Titans withdrawn; the Big Bus Company had completely replaced all its Titans by June 2009. Outside London, they have all been withdrawn since due to them not being DDA Compliant. Stagecoach, who acquired a large number of the type by buying East London and Selkent in 1994, now only have preserved examples of the type. Some of the Titans went abroad, such as New York City, Las Vegas or Florida in the USA, Melbourne, Australia and a couple went to New Zealand. They also function as open-top sightseeing buses.

The adjective \\"mixed\\" usually refers to a mixture of a gravitational anomaly and gauge anomaly, but may also refer to a mixture of two different gauge groups tensored together, like the SU(2) and the U(1) of the Standard Model. The anomaly usually appears as a Feynman diagram with a chiral fermion running in the loop (a polygon) with n‚àík external gravitons and k external gauge bosons attached to the loop where n=1+D/2 where D is the spacetime dimension. Chiral fermions only occur in even spacetime dimensions. For example, the anomalies in the usual 4 spacetime dimensions arise from triangle Feynman diagrams.

It was developed from the Yak-17 in the late 1940s and used a reverse-engineered copy of a British engine. It was not built in large numbers as it was inferior in performance to the swept-wing Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15. Many Yak-23s were exported to the Warsaw Pact nations and remained in service for most of the 1950s, although some were still in use a decade later. Development and description Yakovlev Yak-23UTI On 11 March 1947, the Council of People's Commissars ordered several design bureaux (OKB), including that of Alexander Yakovlev, to develop a single-seat, straight-winged jet fighter to be equipped with a single British Rolls-Royce Nene or Rolls-Royce Derwent turbojet engine. The aircraft should have a maximum speed of at sea level and a speed of at an altitude of . It should be able to climb to that altitude in 3.5 minutes or less and should have a maximum range of no less than . Alexander Yakovlev decided to develop two designs, the Yakovlev Yak-25 in accordance with the Ministry's order and a lightweight, more agile aircraft (the Yak-23) in the hopes that one or the other would win an order from the Ministry. Yakovlev's decision was a risky one as it could be construed as unauthorized use of state monies if discovered, which could have landed Yakovlev in a lot of trouble.Gordon & Kommissarov 2014, pp. 156‚Äì57. To minimize risk, the new aircraft used the same \\"pod-and-boom\\" layout as the earlier Yak-17 fighter, but the metal fuselage was redesigned as a semi-monocoque structure with the single-seat, unpressurized cockpit and its teardrop-shaped canopy positioned just above the trailing edge of the wing. Not coincidentally, this was also above the exhaust of the centrifugal-flow Klimov RD-500 engine, an unlicensed copy of the Derwent V. Fitted with tricycle landing gear, the main landing gear retracted inwards into the fuselage while the nose gear retracted forwards. Unlike the installation in the Yak-17, the Yak-23's forward landing gear was flush with the fuselage when retracted. The laminar-flow, two-spar, wing was mounted in the middle of the fuselage. It was equipped with slotted flaps and ailerons and had a modest 3¬∞ 30' dihedral. The horizontal stabilizers had 5¬∞ of dihedral. The pilot was protected by a bulletproof windscreen and the armored back of the ejection seat. The Yak-23 was equipped with five non-self-sealing fuel tanks in the fuselage that had a total capacity of of fuel. In addition it could carry a pair of drop tanks under the wingtips. The fighter was armed with two Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 autocannon, each with 90 rounds.Gordon & Kommissarov 2014, pp. 204‚Äì11. Two prototypes and a static-test airframe were ordered and the aircraft first flew on 8 July 1947 with the Hero of the Soviet Union, Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Ivanov, at the controls. While still involved in its manufacturer's flight testing, the first prototype participated in the flypast at Tushino Airfield on 3 August. The Yakovlev OKB concluded its testing on 24 September and turned over the second prototype for state acceptance trials on 22 October. Although the Yak-23 was accepted for series production, it was criticized of heavy aileron and rudder forces, lack of cockpit pressurization and heating and ventilation, protection for the pilot and weak armament. The test pilots did praise it as highly maneuverable, with a good acceleration and takeoff and climb capabilities thanks to a high thrust-to-weight ratio. The second prototype was modified afterwards to address some of these issues and successfully tested again in 1948.Gordon & Kommissarov 2014, pp. 164‚Äì65, 168. Operational history The first aircraft were produced in a factory in Tbilisi in October 1949. In late 1949 they entered Soviet air force service. The Yak-23 was quickly replaced in the Soviet service with the more complicated swept-wing MiG-15, which offered superior performance. In all, only 316 Yak-23 aircraft were built before production ended in 1951. Apart from the fighter there were two trainer versions of the Yak-23 which were built in small numbers. The Yak-23UTI two- seat trainer which appears to have had the unusual arrangement of having the instructor seated in front of the student, and the Yak-23DC trainer which was produced in Romania. Small numbers of Yak-23s were exported to Czechoslovakia (20 from 1949, named S-101), Bulgaria (from 1949), Poland (about 100, from 1950), Romania (62, from 1951). Poland and Czechoslovakia acquired licenses for the aircraft, but built the superior MiG-15 instead. Yak-23s were withdrawn by the late 1950s, except in Romania which used them for another decade. =U.S. testing= A single Yak-23 was acquired by US intelligence via Yugoslavia in November 1953. The aircraft was a Romanian Yak-23 flown by Mihail Diaconu who had defected with it. The aircraft arrived disassembled and was shipped to the U.S. Air Force Test and Evaluation Center at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio. It was reassembled and made operational for several test flights, during which time it was disguised with U.S. markings. Efforts were made to keep the aircraft's identity secret and it was flown only in the early morning. On one occasion it was passed on the runway by a formation of F-86 Sabres whose pilots inquired as to the plane's identity. A story was conceived that the aircraft was a Bell X-5, which had a similar layout. At the completion of design and flight evaluations the aircraft was again disassembled and shipped quietly back to Yugoslavia in its original paint scheme. =Records= On September 21, 1957, the Polish pilot Andrzej Ab≈Çamowicz set two FAI world records in the Yak-23 with civilian markings SP- GLK, in its weight class, climbing to 3,000 m (9,843 ft) in 119 seconds (4,962.6 ft/min, 25,21 m/s) and to 6,000 m (19,685 ft) in 197 seconds (5,995.4 ft/min, 30,45 m/s). This plane was withdrawn in 1961.

Founded as an academy in 1885 by the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity, the college achieved four-year college status in 1935 and was then called Holy Family College. In 1972 the college became separately incorporated from the Franciscan order, and was renamed Silver Lake College of the Holy Family. The college announced it is closing in 2020, with the final classes held through August 2020.  History  Holy Family College traces its history to 1885 when the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity established Holy Family Academy and Normal School to prepare young women who entered the religious community for teaching. They founded Holy Family College in 1935. The college began admitting lay women in 1957 and became coeducational in 1969. The college was located in a wing of Holy Family Convent for 25 years. In the late 1950s, a capital campaign was launched to build a new college building on 36 acres adjacent to Holy Family Convent. The new Holy Family College building opened in 1960. In 1972 the college became separately incorporated from the Franciscan order, and was renamed Silver Lake College of the Holy Family. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Silver Lake College of the Holy Family expanded programs to nontraditional students. Beginning in the mid 1980s, the college also offered degree-completion programs and professional development coursework. The St. Joseph Parish church and school, located on campus, added space for meetings, classes and offices. It was named the Generose Enrichment Center for the first college president, Mother M. Generose Cahill, and opened in 2003. George F. Arnold was appointed the college's first lay president and served from 2004 to 2013. Clare Hall was renovated to offer on-campus student housing in 2009. Dr. Robert B. Callahan became Holy Family College's 11th president in 2018. In September 2019, Silver Lake College announced that it would be renamed Holy Family College, in a return to its Franciscan roots. In May 2020, Holy Family College announced it would be closing in late August 2020. The college cited increased expenses and the coronavirus pandemic's drastic effects on enrollment. Enrollment Enrollment is approximately 500 students from the United States and other countries. *32% male *68% female *14% minority Academics Holy Family College offers 21 undergraduate programs and three graduate programs. Accelerated evening coursework on the main campus in Manitowoc and at outreach sites in the state are offered to those with associate degrees who are pursuing a bachelor's or graduate degree. Programs also include academic counseling and credit for prior learning. Other available coursework includes teacher certification and certificate programs ranging from business to ministry to social work. =Four-year nursing program= With a Bachelor of Science in nursing completion program already in place, Silver Lake College opened a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing program in its renovated, $1.5 million nursing wing in 2016. = Work college = In 2016 Silver Lake College initiated SLC Works, a program that incorporates jobs into students' schedules in order to give them work experience, build their r√©sum√©s and apply money earned toward their student debt. In the 2016‚Äì17 academic year, all new full-time residential freshmen and transfer students began participating in SLC Works as a condition of enrollment.  Athletics  HFC athletic teams were known as the Lakers. The college joined the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) in 2016. Holy Family College competed in the NAIA as an independent institution. At the time of the campus closure, HFC offered men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball, men's soccer, women's soccer, men's cross country, women's cross country, men's bowling, and women's bowling.  Accreditation  Holy Family College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, the National Association of Schools of Music, and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.  State of Wisconsin certifications  The college's certifications include the Wisconsin Board of Nursing, Wisconsin Social Work Certificate, and the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.  Memberships  Silver Lake is a member of the Wisconsin Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.

In a camera system the coverage must be large enough to cover the sensor or film used. In a view camera system, because the film plane can be moved independently of the lens plane, the lens must have enough coverage to cover the film while it is offset from the center of the coverage area. Inadequate coverage can lead to vignetting. Sensors in modern digital cameras come in several sizes. Some popular sizes include \\"full-frame\\" or 35mm, APS-C, and 1-inch. Lenses are often intended to work with one of these sensor formats, but in some cases a lens can be used with multiple formats. A ‚Äúfull-frame‚Äù type lens produces an image circle that is large enough to cover a 35mm sensor. Because APS-C sensors are smaller than 35mm sensors a full frame lens should be compatible with an APS-C sensor. An APS-C type lens often does not have the coverage to cast light on the entirety of a 35mm sensor, causing dark corners in the images. thumb One common misconception about lenses is that focal length determines the angle of view for a lens, when in reality it is a combination of focal length, lens coverage, and sensor size. A lens of a certain focal length on a large sensor will yield a wider angle of view than the same lens used with a smaller sensor.

The riots were triggered by economic problems, including food shortages and mass unemployment. It eventually led to the resignation of President Suharto and the fall of the New Order government. The main targets of the violence were ethnic Chinese Indonesians, but most of the casualties were caused by a massive fire and occurred among looters.Collins 2002 , p. 597. It was estimated that more than a thousand people died in the riots. At least 168 cases of rape were reported, and material damage was valued at more than Rp 3.1 trillion. As of 2010, legal proceedings regarding the riots have yet to be completed.  Background  On 27 July 1996, soldiers, police, and civilians attacked the headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party (', PDI) in Central Jakarta, which was occupied by supporters of party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of former President Sukarno. Megawati had been selected as party leader in general congress in December 1993. Her selection, however, was seen as a threat by the New Order government, which suppressed free speech during its 30 years in power. Popular support of Megawati and the PDI was growing leading up to the 1997 legislative election and threatened the dominance of the ruling Golkar party. The government declared Megawati's appointment invalid and organised a new congress in June 1996, during which a new party leader was selected. The attackers said they were acting on behalf of the rightful party leadership. The incident evolved into two days of rioting in Jakarta that the government blamed on the People's Democratic Party (', PRD). Violence continued up to the election on 29 May 1997, which was won by Golkar with 74% of the votes. The divided PDI received only 3% of the votes, while the mostly Muslim United Development Party (', PPP) received 22%. Trisakti University students demonstrate to reject the 1998 Special Session of the People's Consultative Assembly, which elected Suharto to seven consecutive five-year terms in office as president between 1968 and 1998. The election was marred by widespread cases of vote-rigging, causing public outcry especially among supporters of the PPP, which had called on the government to follow a democratic process lest the results be rejected by the public. At this time, Indonesia was experiencing an economic boom with its gross domestic product growing at a rate of 8% in 1996, led by the manufacturing sector. Five months after the election, however, it was caught in the Asian Financial Crisis which began when the Thai baht collapsed in July. The rupiah dropped from Rp2,450 to Rp4,000 to the US dollar between July and October, and economic growth slowed to 1.4% in the fourth quarter. Unable to stabilise the economy, the government sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The rupiah declined further to one-sixth of its original value by January 1998. With rising unemployment and inflated food prices, the public lost confidence in the government's ability to turn the economy around. Violence spread throughout the island of Java, but the government exercised its power in February and imposed a 25-day ban on street protests. Law enforcement officials were given the authority to imprison anyone found participating in political activities in violation of the ban. Suharto was elected by the People's Consultative Assembly (', MPR) to a seventh consecutive five-year term as president in March. Despite calls for economic and political reforms, his controversial Seventh Development Cabinet included his family members and cronies, including prot√©g√© B. J. Habibie as vice-president. Student demonstrations in campuses grew in intensity following these events.  Riots  = Medan (4‚Äì8 May) = Trisakti University students and police forces clash in May 1998 By the beginning of May, students had been demonstrating in campuses throughout Medan for nearly two months. The growing number of demonstrators was coupled with increasing calls from the public for overall reforms. On 27 April, the death of a student in a vehicle accident was blamed on security officials who had fired tear gas onto the campus. Over the next few days, the clashes between students and security forces grew. On 2 May, a showroom of the \\"national car\\" Timor, whose controversial development was spearheaded by the President's son Tommy Suharto, was attacked. When the government announced on 4 May that it would increase the price of gasoline by 70% and triple the price of electricity, campus groups reacted. More than 500 students gathered at the State Institute of Teacher Training and Education (', IKIP Negeri). Security forces barricaded the campus to prevent students from leaving and allegedly threw Molotov bombs at demonstrators through the day. Although the students had dispersed by late afternoon, replacement forces were brought in to keep them on campus through the night. When they were allowed to return home hours later, police reportedly stopped a group of students and assaulted them. Word of this attack spread through several witnesses, and a large group later attacked and destroyed a traffic police post. As the outnumbered police fled, protesters began attacking shopping malls and another police post. Thousands poured into the streets and burned cars and shops through the late night. On the morning of 5 May, a crowd gathered at a police station where it was reported that more than 50 people suspected of involvement in the previous night's attack were detained. When more officers arrived to confront the group, the station was attacked. The crowd moved toward the nearby market of Tembung as they burned cars and attacked houses. Shops owned by Chinese Indonesians were looted, while they reportedly left those marked with the words \\"'\\" (owned by the indigenous pribumi) in graffiti alone. When the Mobile Brigade arrived in the afternoon, the crowd was dispersed with tear gas. As businesses in Medan closed on the following day, thousands of people attacked markets throughout the city and its surrounding districts. Police and anti- riot soldiers fired rubber bullets at the crowd to disperse them but were unsuccessful. When the violence ended two days later, six people had died (two by gunshot) and one hundred were injured (nine with gunshot wounds). Police detained 51 people for questioning, and the damage was estimated in the hundreds of billions of rupiah. Many looted shophouses were mainly in nearby indigenous and outskirt areas like Jalan Aksara, Tembung, Pasar Baru, Brayan and Pancing. Meanwhile, in Chinese-majority areas such as Medan Kota and Maimun districts (Jalan Asia, Kesawan, Pandu, Cirebon, Wahidin, Sutrisno, Sumatra), Cemara, Sunggal, Setiabudi and several roads nearby are mostly safe from the mobs due to strict guarding by local residents. = Jakarta (12‚Äì14 May) = Destroyed DPR/MPR courtroom, after being occupied by students. On 9 May, one day after the violence in Medan ended, President Suharto left the country for a Group of 15 summit in Cairo, Egypt. Prior to his departure, he called on the public to end the protests. To the Suara Pembaruan daily newspaper, he said, \\"I judge that if we continue like this there will be no progress.\\" He later returned to Indonesia earlier than scheduled on 14 May, when violence in Jakarta reached its worst. The campus of Trisakti University in Grogol, West Jakarta, became the site of a gathering of 10,000 students on 12 May. They had planned on marching south toward the Parliament building, but security forces refused to allow them to leave the campus. When the students conducted a sit-in outside the campus gates, shots broke out after rocks were allegedly thrown at police. In the ensuing chaos, four students were killed. Catalysed by the student deaths, mass violence began almost simultaneously throughout Jakarta the following day. The Matahari department store in the eastern district of Jatinegara and Yogya Plaza in Klender were barricaded and deliberately torched. It was estimated that at least a thousand people died inside the buildings during the fires. Mobs also attacked Glodok in the northwestern part of the city, where the commercial area of Jakarta's Chinatown was severely damaged. Some store owners reportedly paid local thugs to protect them from the violence because security forces were mostly absent. Riots also occurred near the port of Tanjung Priok in the north, the city of Tangerang to the west, and Kebayoran Baru in the south. Properties owned by Chinese Indonesians were the most common targets. = Surakarta (14‚Äì15 May) = Student protests in Surakarta (also called Solo) began as early as March at the Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta (', UMS) and the Sebelas Maret (11 March) University (', UNS) and grew over the next two months, prompting the police to station officers outside both campuses to prevent them from entering the streets. On 8 May, later known as \\"Bloody Friday\\", a clash between UNS students and police forces resulted in hundreds of wounded students. There was also evidence of gunfire as police launched tear gas canisters and fired rubber bullets. UMS students clashed with security forces on 14 May during a protest of the Trisakti shootings in Jakarta. A report of the incident claimed that the violence was provoked by students throwing objects at police from campus grounds. Security forces were unable to disperse the group, and the angered mob of 1,000 moved eastward into the city. A showroom of Timor cars was attacked, much like the violence in Medan earlier in the month. Kostrad (Army Strategic Reserve) forces arrived as the crowd attacked banks and public buildings in the city centre and prevented them from reaching the city hall. From there, they broke up into smaller groups and attacked the surrounding districts of Surakarta. More people poured into the streets when tires were lit on fire at intersections. Because 11 companies of the Brimob, crowd control forces, and Kostrad soldiers had remained on the UMS campus, downtown Surakarta was left unprotected. Additionally, members of the Kopassus (special forces) had left the city earlier in the day. A group of 15 \\"provocateurs\\" was said to have directed crowds using walkie-talkies and incited some of the violence using crowbars to open buildings and throwing Molotov bombs into them. Because electricity was cut throughout the city that evening, residents were not able to receive television and radio coverage of the events. Instead, they relied on the local newspaper Solo Pos for accounts of the previous day on 15 May. As the attacks continued to a second day, 10,000 student protesters organised a separate peaceful protest and marched from the UNS campus to the city hall, explaining that they were not connected to the mob violence. = Other cities = On 14 May 1998, in Sidotopo, Surabaya, rioters targeted Chinese-owned stores and homes, burning their properties. After the riots, ten thousand Madurese patrolled the streets from further attempted riots, armed with celurit. The Joint Fact Finding Team (', TGPF) found two cases of rape and four cases of sexual assault. On 14 May 1998, at least ten offices, banks, and showrooms in Padang, West Sumatra, had rocks thrown at them by student rioters on the way to the Provincial People's Representative Council (DPRD) office of West Sumatra. On the same day, in Palembang, South Sumatra, ten shops were burned, more than a dozen cars were burned by rioters, and dozens of people were injured by rocks thrown by students marching to the DPRD office of South Sumatra. Thousands of police and soldiers were put on guard at various points in the city. The non-governmental Volunteer Team for Humanity (, or TRUK) reported that cases of sexual assault also took place. On 15 May 1998, at roughly 14:20 WIB, thousands of rioters from Surakarta arrived in Boyolali, burning factories, cars and homes, as well as looting stores near the Boyolali market. Banks were closed due to threats to burn Bank Central Asia branch in Salatiga, rioters blocked the road from Semarang to Surakarta. =Death toll= Most of the deaths suffered when Chinese-owned supermarkets in Jakarta were targeted for looting in May were all ethnic Chinese - including monks, some were raped and murdered. The total death toll was around 1,188 according to one report, and at least 85 women were reported raped. The violence was directed at destroying property owned by Chinese Indonesians and Chinese temples.http://mprk.ugm.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panggabean- Smith-Explaining-Anti-chinese-Riots-in-Late-20th-Century- Indonesia.pdf.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227427486_Explaining_Anti- Chinese_Riots_in_Late_20th_Century_Indonesia The majority of anti-Chinese violence in previous riots also involved only by looting Chinese shops and property without killing the owners themselves. Most Indonesians did not want to drive out the Chinese or murder them, but some of them falsely believed that the Chinese have an infinite supply of products and thought that the shops would open again in the future despite the looting. =Allegations of false pictures= On 19 August, a group called the Reformasi Presidium Council of Youth and Students of Surabaya issued a statement claiming that the rape photographs were 'bohong belaka' (flat out lies) and part of a 'rekayasa' (political engineering) with the goal of inciting hatred against Indonesia. The following day, this story was picked up by Asia Wall Street Journal, and the story broke internationally. The story claims that the sources of some of these photographs were from a gory photo exhibit and a pornographic website, including one named \\"Sexy Asian Schoolgirls\\". This story made its way into an Indonesian national newspaper, Republika, a few days later and began to be widely disseminated in other local newspapers as well. Scholars have since commented on the impact of these allegations. Following sharing of these photographs online, an intense debate broke out in online Chinese communities. Australian researcher Elaine Tay believes such discussions \\"do not give the sense that these participants are conscious of the issue of authenticity\\". As such, she argues that these commentators or \\"diasporic activists\\", have \\"unwittingly complicated the investigation into this issue\\". American author Karen Strassler is concerned with the effect of these allegations on the Indonesian public discourse. She argues that although many Indonesians did not see the photos, the \\"discussion of them in the press served those who would deny the rapes particularly well.\\" The campaign to question the veracity and authenticity of the photographs creates \\"extraordinary power to discredit the effort to gain recognition for the rape victims.\\"  Response  = Government response = B. J. Habibie takes the presidential oath of office following Suharto's resignation, one week after the violence. He later appointed a fact-finding team to investigate the May riots. Violence in Medan drew the attention of national security officers. General Wiranto, Commander of the Armed Forces (', Pangab, or Panglima ABRI), toured the affected areas on 6 May and committed his forces to help restore calm to the city. Two days later, Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto of the Kostrad (Army Strategic Reserve) deployed one of his units \\"to support local troops and assured the public that others were ready to go into troubled areas should the need arise\\". Neither effort, however, was able to contain the violence as the riots continued in Medan for another three days following Wiranto's visit, leading the public to believe that few orders were carried out by the deployed units. Order was finally restored when regional military commander Yuzaini requested the help of community leaders and youth organisations to arrange for local patrols (') with security forces. Security inaction continued as violence escalated in Jakarta, and the military leadership in charge of security in the capital city‚ÄîWiranto, Prabowo, and General Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono‚Äîwere absent. Military and police response in the capital was inconsistent. Soldiers in the northern area of Mangga Besar allegedly stood by and allowed looters to walk away with stolen goods. In Slipi to the west, soldiers reportedly risked their lives to protect civilians. In Surakarta, Armed Forces representative Colonel Sriyanto denied allegations of neglect by the military. He claimed that ground forces were limited because some units were en route to Jakarta while the few left behind were assisting police in controlling protesters at the Muhammadiyah University. For the most part, the military portrayed the violence \\"in terms of mobs gone mad, acting in an uncontrollable and spontaneous manner, outnumbering security forces\\". Susuhunan Pakubuwono XII, the traditional monarch of Surakarta, condemned the violence as behaviour \\"not in line with the cultural values held by ' (Solonese)\\". He also made a rare appearance on 19 May to demonstrate solidarity by the elites with victims of the violence. In a meeting with 5,000 students at his palace complex, he pledged a symbolic amount of Rp1,111,111 to support the students' calls for reform. As it was evident that Suharto had lost control of his senior military leaders, he resigned one week after the violence on 21 May. Two months later, on 23 July, his successor B. J. Habibie appointed the TGPF to conduct an official investigation of the May riots. During the investigation, the team had difficulty finding witnesses who were willing to testify about the violence, and the team was only given three months to investigate riots in six cities. Data collected by the team mainly came from non-governmental organisations and the state-sponsored Communication Forum for National Unity (', Bakom PKB), which had compiled numerous police reports on the incidents. The full report totalling hundreds of pages was never distributed to the public and was only available to members of the team, relevant government ministers, and a few researchers. The media received a 20-page summary in both Indonesian and English, which was then distributed widely on the Internet. To this day, government officials deny the occurrence of sexual violence, citing a lack of police reports despite overwhelming evidence from local human rights groups. = Public reaction = Chinese Indonesians in Medan became victims of the local ' (gangsters) who threatened the community with violence. Prior to the rioting, the Chinese commonly used extra-legal methods to ensure their protection and security. Consequently, groups who extorted money from the Chinese‚Äîsometimes agents of government‚Äîsaw them as nothing but \\"cash cows\\". During the violence, however, intimidation was often followed by the looting of Chinese-owned stores and businesses. Chinese Indonesians were angered and felt betrayed by this action, and many fled the area for Malaysia, Singapore, Australia or other locations in Indonesia. Those who remained checked into indigenous-owned hotels or armed themselves to form a community defence group. However, local community members distinguished this incident from previous anti-Chinese violence because threats against the Chinese were \\"a part of the socioeconomic and political structure of the city\\". They believed that the riots were incited by either student demonstrations or thugs who sought to discredit the reform movement. Stories of sexual violence with perpetrators shouting anti-Chinese slogans and other verbal abuses during the Jakarta riots shocked Indonesians. As the incidents were represented as state-sponsored violence, national and international groups became more vocal in calling for reform and the government to step down. Muhammadiyah leader Amien Rais denounced the violence in Surakarta, which he saw as more destructive than the riots on Jakarta. The Islamic organisation manages the UMS campus, where student clashes with police on 14 May prompted the ensuing violence. His statement that the Surakarta incident was orchestrated by a ' (puppeteer) rather than unorganised masses became a national headline. Unlike in Jakarta, local citizens in Surakarta did not view the violence in their city as anti- Chinese. This image was further cultivated by the insistence of influential Chinese Indonesians that the causes were \\"multifaceted\\". Most Chinese who fled during the violence returned after it had subsided, unlike those in Medan and Jakarta. = International reaction = When the Jakarta riots began, the United States government ordered the evacuation of \\"dependents and non- essential personnel\\" of the consulate. The Department of State also recommended US citizens to leave the country using commercial flights or evacuation flights organised by US forces. The and its \\"Flying Tigers\\" Marine Helicopter Squadron were stationed in the region as part of a contingency evacuation plan for US citizens and embassy personnel, known as Operation Bevel Incline. In the Department of State's \\"Indonesia Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1998\\", the US accused Suharto's government of committing \\"serious human rights abuses\\". Between the 1997 election and the riots, students and human rights activists were kidnapped and tortured while in the custody security forces. The report also mentioned that police stoned and fired at foreign journalists covering a clash between students and security forces on 6 May. As news of attacks on Chinese Indonesians during the violence reached the international ethnic Chinese community, the riots were labelled as \\"anti-Chinese\\" in nature. In a letter to President Habibie, leader of the Hong Kong Democratic Party Martin Lee wrote, \\"The severity of these two days of mayhem evoked comparisons to the Nazi regime's attacks against Jews.\\" Ethnic Chinese organised protests through the website Global Huaren, founded by Malaysian Chinese emigrant Joe Tan in New Zealand. Tan founded the website in response to \\"seeming indifference\\" around the world and spread news of the violence to professionals and colleagues. Members then coordinated rallies at Indonesian embassies and consulates in major Pacific Rim cities. Solidarity from the international community brought about a renewed awareness of ethnic and national identity‚ÄîIndonesian and Chinese‚Äîamong Chinese Indonesians \\"because for so long the one had been sacrificed for the other\\". China's cautious response to the issue caused an uproar among human rights groups. Following protests at the Indonesian embassy in Beijing in August, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made a direct appeal to the Indonesian government to ensure the protection of Chinese Indonesian communities. During a visit to Jakarta in November, Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin said that \\"Chinese Indonesians will not only serve ... the long term stability of Indonesia, but also ... the smooth development of the relationship of friendly cooperation with neighboring countries.\\" China claims they have also urged airlines to operate three more flights out of Indonesia, which transported some 200 Chinese people away from Jakarta. The riots became known in China as \\"Black May\\" (), named after a VCD documentary of the events released by the China Radio and Television Publishing House in October. Compared to China's approach, Taiwan took on a more active role in demanding the trial of those involved in the violence and protection for victims. It threatened to withdraw investments from the country, estimated at US$13 billion in 1998, and block the entry of Indonesian workers, whose population in Taiwan had reached 15,000. Taiwan justified the threats \\"based on the principles of protecting overseas Chinese and protecting human rights\\". On 9 August, Minister of Investment Hamzah Haz flew to Taiwan and apologised for the violence while promoting Indonesia as an investment destination. At the same time, a Taiwanese delegation met with Wiranto, who was then the Defence Minister under Habibie, as well as several other government ministers. Aftermath and legacy Students march to reject a special session of the MPR in November 1998. For more than a week after the riots in Jakarta, locals feared for their safety and stayed home. Most banks, businesses, and public buildings remained closed in major cities throughout the country. Some government offices reopened for the commemoration of National Awakening Day on 20 May. Despite fears that the riots could worsen, only three minor incidents occurred in smaller cities. Data compiled by the fact-finding team on the human toll of the violence in the capital was conflicting. TRUK reported 1,109 deaths from fire, 27 gunshot deaths, 91 wounded, and an additional 31 missing. Police reports counted 463 dead and 69 wounded, while the city government only reported 288 dead and 101 wounded. Property damage was estimated at Rp2.5 trillion (US$238 million), with the city government reporting 5,723 buildings and 1,948 vehicles destroyed, while police reports counted 3,862 buildings and 2,693 vehicles. Damage in Surakarta was estimated at Rp457 billion (US$46 million), with Chinese Indonesians suffering most of the material losses. Members of TGPF appointed by Habibie believed their mandate for seeking the truth behind the violence included drawing conclusions and making recommendations. Although they were given access to members of the military elite, their findings came into conflict with the military and the government. Unwilling to let go of \\"the power to be gained by having a monopoly over ... 'representations' of the violence\\", government officials and the military elite inside and outside Soeharto's circle rejected or ignored the team's findings. Sections of the report were also challenged by the national media. The People's Representative Council (', DPR) eventually declared the riots \\"ordinary crimes\\" during the Megawati administration (2001‚Äì2004). The collapse of Soeharto's government also led to the intensification of separatist movements in the outlying provinces of Aceh, Papua, and East Timor. Ethnic and religious conflicts also flared in Maluku and Central Sulawesi as law and order deteriorated. In a January 1999 poll by the daily newspaper The Jakarta Post, 77% of respondents rated public safety levels as bad or very bad. Economic conditions continued to fluctuate in the first few months of Habibie's presidency, and the National Police reported that crime increased by 10% during 1998. =Alleged military involvement= Based on reports of military inaction during the riots, the TGPF made an unprecedented allegation against the military elite. The team concluded that \\"the Armed Forces had failed to anticipate the riot, that there was a lack of adequate communications between those in command and those on the ground, and that, as a consequence, the forces had responded tardily in most cases and sometimes not at all\\". Soldiers allegedly allowed rioting to continue in some areas, while others were hesitant to fire at civilians under the Armed Forces doctrine. Evidence of decision making at the \\"highest levels\\" of government led the team to conclude the violence was \\"an effort to create a critical situation that required a form of extra-constitutional government to control the situation\\". However, its members admitted that the story lacked a crucial link between the military and rioters. According to the fact-finding team, Prabowo Subianto was a key figure in military involvement with rioters in Jakarta. Investigations revealed that violence in Jakarta was the result of an internal struggle within the military elite to become Suharto's successor, with evidence that some of the damaged areas were near military installations with reports that riot organisers had military-like characteristics. Many believed Kostrad commander Prabowo Subianto sought to become his father-in- law's successor and coveted the Commander of the Armed Forces position held by General Wiranto, who was favoured to succeed Suharto. He was also suspected of organising the kidnappings of students and activists prior to the 1997 election. Together with Operations Commander for Greater Jakarta (', Pangkoops Jaya) Major General Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, Prabowo aimed to terrorise opponents of the government and to show that Wiranto was \\"an incompetent commander who could not control disorder\\". During August and September, the fact-finding team interviewed Prabowo, Sjafrie, and other military commanders regarding their movements during the Jakarta riots. Prabowo asserted that he was unsure of the precise movements of military forces in the capital and deferred to Sjafrie. In the meantime, the Operations Commander was vague in his testimony and stated that security forces were protecting \\"priority locations\\". In its final report, the fact-finding team suspected that, on the night of 14 May, Prabowo met with several Armed Forces and prominent civilian figures at the Kostrad headquarters to discuss the organisation of the violence. However, this was later refuted by several people who attended the meeting, including prominent human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution and TGPF member Bambang Widjojanto. Further testimonies by Prabowo in the years following the investigation contradicted the team's report and led to scepticism of the team's allegations. When Suharto resigned his mandate on 21 May, both Prabowo and Wiranto were bypassed in favour of a constitutional power transfer to Vice-President Habibie. Prabowo was transferred to a non-active position on the following day before being discharged from service in August. He and Wiranto denied that the discharge was a result of disciplinary action. =Effect on Chinese Indonesian communities= A portrait of ethnic Chinese tycoon Sudono Salim‚Äîone of the world's wealthiest men at the time‚Äîand his wife is burned by rioters when his Jakarta house was ransacked during the riots. Provocateurs, suspected to be military, goaded rioters, screaming ethnic insults like \\"Cina babi!\\" () and \\"Ganyang Cina!\\" (). The provocateurs also shouted commands, directing the riots towards Chinese-owned businesses and away from Native Indonesian-owned ones. In this climate of fear, between 10,000 and 100,000 ethnic Chinese, who made up about 3‚Äì5% of Indonesia's Chinese population, fled the country. Thousands of foreign nationals and expatriates left Indonesia, some evacuated by their embassies. Sexual violence In the days during riots, many women suffered from sexual violence with most of the incidents taking place in Jakarta. The attacks appeared to be an organised campaign of assaults against ethnic Chinese women by the same groups that organised the riots. Accounts compiled by aid workers depicted a wide range of attacks from humiliation, child rape, and gang-rape followed by murder. More than a hundred women were reported to have been assaulted or killed. The Volunteer Team for Humanity recorded 168 cases of sexual assault, with 152 in Jakarta and the remaining 16 in Surakarta, Medan, Palembang, and Surabaya; of these victims, twenty had died by 14 July 1998. The US State Department noted in its report: The Indonesian government has responded with conflicting messages. President Habibie issued a statement acknowledging the violence and regretted it as \\"not in accordance with the cultural values of the Indonesian people\\" and condemned it in the name of the government and all Indonesians. However other authorities denied that any rape had taken place. The intelligence chief stated that the incident \\"was spread for political purposes to defame Indonesia\\" and the police commander threatened to prosecute any organisation publicising the rape issue on charges of spreading false rumours. In the aftermath of the violence, JFF was tasked to document the rapes. After JFF reported that the violence had been organised, General Wiranto publicly apologised for the army's failure to prevent the violence and acknowledged that elements in the military were involved. In addition to government-mandated JFF, a special rapporteur was established by the United Nations to validate JFF findings and interview some of the victims. Both have officially reported that the sexual abuse in May 1998 did occur. The rapporteur noted that the difficulty of interviewing rape victims and lack of testimonials had been used to discredit the fact-finding effort and in one instance to twist it to portray that the incident was fabricated to raise resentment against Indonesian Muslims. In 2008 National Women Commission working together with the UN rapporteur issued recommendations to the government to adopt violence elimination, victim protection and recovery, gender awareness measures. These measures have been accepted and implemented into policies. However, the general public still refuses to acknowledge the rapes and legal proceeding against the perpetrators has stalled. In popular culture Dramas and other works of fiction have been written in response to the 1998 riots, especially regarding the racial aspects and rapes of Chinese Indonesian women. These include Putri Cina (), by Indonesian Catholic priest and author Sindhunata, which deals with the loss of identity experienced by Chinese Indonesians after the riots and is written in part from the point of view of a rape victim.

The game was released in North America on April 8, 2001. The game is an enhanced remake of Dr. Mario, which was originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy consoles in 1990. The game's soundtrack was composed by Seiichi Tokunaga, featuring arrangements of classic Dr. Mario tunes and new compositions. It was re-released along with Panel de Pon and Yoshi's Cookie as part of the Japan-exclusive Nintendo Puzzle Collection, released for the GameCube in 2003.Nintendo Puzzle Collection - GameCube Preview, IGN. Gameplay A screenshot of Dr. Mario 64 gameplay. Like its predecessor, Dr. Mario 64 is a falling block tile-matching video game. The playing field is represented on-screen as a medicine bottle populated with viruses of three colors: red, blue, and yellow. The main objective of the game to clear the playing field of all the viruses using two- colored medical capsules dropped into the bottle. The player manipulates the capsules as they fall, moving them left or right and rotating such that they are positioned alongside the viruses and any existing capsules. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of the same colour are aligned in horizontal or vertical configurations, they are removed from play. The player receives a game over if the playing field fills up with capsules such that they obstruct the bottle's narrow neck. Points are awarded when viruses are destroyed. There are several single-player modes present in the game: * Classic - This mode features a similar set-up and design to the original Dr. Mario game. * Story - In this mode the player may take control of either Dr. Mario or Wario to track down the stolen Megavitamins, battling computer players on the way. * Vs. Computer - In this mode the player may battle against the computer as any character the player has played as or fought against. * Flash - In this mode the player must eliminate three particular flashing viruses faster than the computer can. * Marathon - This mode consists of a never-ending rising field of viruses which does not end until the player quits or loses. * Score Attack - In this mode the player is given three minutes to clear all of the viruses as well as get a high score. Some modes are available for two players to play simultaneously: * 2-Player Versus - Two players can battle against one another. * Flash - Two players race to eliminate three particular flashing viruses before the other player can. * Score Attack - Two players try to get the most points in a three-minute time period. * Tetris Battle - Two players collect Tetris blocks to win. A multiplayer mode also allows up to four players to compete at once. Plot The flu season has come about, and it is Dr. Mario's duty to use his Megavitamins to heal the people of the land. However, Wario, wanting to sell the pills to get rich, attempts to steal the Megavitamins, but to no avail. Afterwards, Mad Scienstein (from Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru) and Rudy the Clown (from Wario Land 3) steal the Megavitamins, and both Dr. Mario and Wario give chase. Throughout their adventure, both of them meet up with many creatures from Wario Land 3. Most of the time the fights that emerge are really misunderstandings; for example, the player may accidentally bump into a creature, who gets angry and retaliates. Dr. Mario and Wario follow Mad Scienstein to Rudy's castle, where they fight Rudy to take back the vitamins. If the game is completed on Normal or Hard mode without using a continue, one last battle occurs after defeating Rudy; the opponent is Metal Mario for Wario and Vampire Wario for Dr. Mario. Reception Dr. Mario 64 in all of its various permutations was voted #76 in the Top 100 Games of All Time poll published by Game Informer in August 2001. IGN criticized the game for being \\"more of the same\\" and gave it a middling score of 5 out of 10. GameSpot gave the game 7 out of 10, summarizing that \\"Dr. Mario is a legitimate and satisfying puzzle game that is executed rather nicely in this four-player-focused package.\\" Notes References External links * 2001 video games Dr. Mario games Wario video games Video game remakes Nintendo 64 games Falling block puzzle games IQue games Mario puzzle games Video games developed in Japan Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Dr. Mario 64"},{"id":"1372495","text":"Barrington Somers Pheloung (10 May 1954 ‚Äì 1 August 2019) was an Australian composer based in the United Kingdom.

The mall features a central building designed to resemble an ocean liner surrounded by a small village of cottage-style bungalows. It was designed by Robert V. Derrah, built in 1936, and has been called America's first outdoor shopping mall. Once a busy shopping center, the Crossroads later became private offices, primarily for the entertainment industry with a variety of music publishers and producers, television and film script writers, film and recording companies, novelists, costume designers, publicists, and casting agencies. The owner is planning on redeveloping the site. History In 1931, after Charles H. Crawford's death, his wife Ella decided to build a multi-national outdoor market - that would feel like ¬´a permanent world's fair with a cosmopolitan atmosphere¬ª - on the land where her husband was shot. She hired the Streamline Moderne architect Robert V. Derrah (who was finishing his work on the Coca-Cola Building) to design the complex.Kim Sudhalter, Have you ever wondered... What the Crossroads of the World is all about?, Onlyinhollywood.com, 1 December 2014 Derrah designed a ship-shaped structure in the center of the complex. The surrounding buildings represented different countries of the world. The complex originally held 57 shops and cafes, and 36 offices on the upper floors. The Crossroads of the World was inaugurated on 29 October 1936. The new shopping center was not a full-blown success, but it became an excellent model for outdoors malls across the world. In the 1950s, the Crossroads of the World was converted into an office complex. The Screen Actors Guild, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Jackson Browne and Alfred Hitchcock used to rent offices there. The property was purchased in 1977 by the real estate investor Mort La Kretz and restored. On June 1, 1985, Michael Perricone founded Interlock Studios, an audio post production facility, which was located in Bungalow 1522 of the complex, until 1998, when it relocated to 6520 Sunset Boulevard, and was sold to Rick Larson a few years later, who renamed it Larson Studios. In January 2019, the Los Angeles City Council approved the project to revamp the Crossroads of the World in a move to revitalize the district. Three high-rise buildings are planned to bring 950 apartments and condos, a 308-room hotel, and of commercial space.

Although it is only a little over 2 miles in length, it is the largest abandoned subway tunnel system in the United States. Construction began in the early 1900s as an upgrade to the Cincinnati streetcar system, but was abandoned due to escalating costs, the collapse of funding amidst political bickering, and the Great Depression during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1928, the construction of the subway system in Cincinnati was indefinitely canceled. There are no plans to revive the project. History Rapid transit was seen as the solution for downtown congestion in Cincinnati during the first quarter of the 20th century. Six million dollars were allocated for the project, but construction was delayed due to World War I. Unexpected post-war inflation doubled the cost of construction, so the project could not be finished at the original estimated price. Various attempts to use the subway tunnels for mass transit have been unsuccessful. Political squabbling, the Great Depression, World War II, and the rise in popularity of the automobile have contributed to the failure of the proposals. Today, many Cincinnatians are unaware of the tunnels beneath them. =Context= Former location of the Miami and Erie Canal in downtown Cincinnati. From 1825 to 1920 the Miami and Erie Canal divided Cincinnati's residential neighborhood of Over-the-Rhine from the business district of downtown. The canal was used to transport goods and people from the Great Lakes to the Ohio River and subsequently the Mississippi River via Cincinnati, until the popularity of railroads caused it to become disused. The canal became unprofitable by 1856 and was abandoned by the city in 1877. On September 15, 1883, a weekly Cincinnati magazine called The Graphic proposed that the \\"dead old ditch\\" be used to provide an unobstructed route for a subway system, with a large boulevard above. Cincinnati began adopting electric streetcars in 1888; this soon became the main form of public transportation. During this period Cincinnati was one of the seven most populous US citiesand had a rate of growth and economic importance that was similar to that of New York City and Chicago. The slow streetcars shared the crowded streets with horse-drawn carriages and people, and collided with the first automobiles on an almost daily basis. It was not unusual for trips between downtown and the surrounding suburbs to take 45 minutes to an hour. Despite having of streetcar tracks, the city found itself in a growing traffic nightmare. Another newspaper, the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, gave encouraging words to the public and said \\"We believe that the city we love, our home, is at the turning point, and that with the coming of Rapid Transit we will have the beginning of a Greater, More Prosperous, Healthier and Happier Cincinnati. We believe that a Vote for the Loop is a Vote for the best interests of all of us, and it is with pride that we state that every newspaper in the city is for the Loop, and practically all of the Business organizations as well as the Trades Unions.\\" This helped the project win the fight in the polls when the people of Cincinnati enthusiastically passed bill to start construction. =Planning= In 1910, Henry Thomas Hunt spearheaded plans for a new rapid transit system. The next year, City Council convinced the Ohio State Legislature to lease the city's portion of the canal for use as a boulevard and subway system. The city hired experts who had worked on Boston's and Chicago's rapid transit systems to research the best possible implementation for Cincinnati's rapid transit system. The result were four \\"Schemes\\", or proposed routes. The chosen plan‚ÄîScheme IV, modification H‚Äîlooped around the city hitting the central suburbs of St. Bernard and Norwood, the eastern suburbs of Oakley and Hyde Park, and then returned into downtown. In 1916, City Council authorized a bond issue of $6 million with an interest rate of 4.25 percent, and then held a plebiscite on the rapid transit plan. The bond was supposed to fund a subway system stretching across Cincinnati, which would, in turn, slow or even stop the decline of Cincinnati's population at the time. One advertisement in support of the subway proclaimed, \\"Every newspaper in the city is for the Loop, and practically all of the Business organizations as well as the Trades Unions.\\" On April 17, 1917, Cincinnati citizens voted in favor of using the bond for a Rapid Transit system, 30,165 to 14,286. The system would be built as a below grade, at grade and elevated railway. Underground portion to be built in the Miami and Erie Canal bed through downtown. Extend through the Mill Creek valley to St. Bernard, Norwood, Oakley. = Proposed route: description from 1916 bond campaignInter-Urban Entrance and Rapid Transit Railway for the City of Cincinnati 1916.

However, because the United States entered World War I just 11 days earlier, construction was halted because no capital issues of bonds were permitted during the war. =Construction and failure= When the war ended in 1918, costs had increased. By 1919 the cost of construction had doubled, increasing the original price to complete the loop from $12 million to $13 million. Regardless, the city began work on January 28, 1920, at the current intersection of Walnut Street and Central Parkway, and the city planned to raise the money to complete the loop later, since funds were so low and there was a shortage in construction materials. The subway's construction caused the foundations of buildings along the route to crack, leading to much litigation against the subway. When funds ran out in 1927, construction ended with of subway dug or graded, but no track had been laid. Liberty Street Station.leftalt= New estimates to complete the loop ranged from an additional $6 million to $12 million. The eastern part of the loop was later canceled as a cost-cutting measure. The boulevard that ran on top of the subway, Central Parkway, officially opened to traffic on October 1, 1928, and was followed by a week of public celebration. However, by the late 1920s, Prohibition had severely impacted the city, because alcoholic beverages, a major source of revenue for the city, were not allowed to be purchased. Still, as late as 1926‚Äì1927, new tunnels, such as the Hopple Street Tunnel, were being built. Once it became apparent that the original rapid transit plan had failed, political infighting in City Hall stalled any new progress, due to an anti-City Hall campaign led by city manager Murray Seasongood beginning in 1920. Newspapers started to print articles arguing against the subway, using such rationales as the tight curve of the subway and its small tunnels to try to advocate against its completion. Along with this, the cities of Norwood and Saint Bernard continuously negotiated with the city of Cincinnati, pushing the construction back another year. Two more months were piled on to the delay. Also, Brighton residents were upset with the blast damages destroying their property. The construction methods created suspicion to state examiners. In January 1929, Seasongood ‚Äì by then the Mayor ‚Äì discontinued the Rapid Transit Commission, which until then had been in control of the subway's construction; that year, his own office took control of the project. Any hope of raising the money to complete the subway was further delayed with the stock market crash of 1929. Though few citizens owned automobiles when Mayor Hunt first planned rapid transit in 1910, their increasing popularity and convenience helped fuel critics' arguments against a subway system. They began referring to the project as \\"Cincinnati's White Elephant.\\" Even so, the \\"temporary\\" hiatus on construction was expected to end after the economy got better, and many Cincinnatians, including Seasongood, hoped that the subway would finally be completed. =Attempts at revival= There have been many attempts to complete the tunnels, but the reasons why the subway was never completed or used for another significant purpose are unclear. In 1936 the city commissioned the Engineers' Club of Cincinnati to produce a report on how to use the unfinished rapid transit property. The report could not find any use for the tunnels other than what they had been designed for. Because the city's needs had changed from twenty years earlier, the report suggested that the subway \\"should be forgotten\\". In 1939 the tunnels were researched for possible automobile traffic, but were found to be unsuitable for that use. In 1940 the city sought the advice of several experts to settle once and for all the fate of the subway. The report recommended placing all streetcar and trolley transportation underground (i.e., a subway), but Cincinnati already had too many other expensive public projects underway. In any case, the plan was put on hold yet again when the United States entered World War II in 1941. During World War II the city was focused on wartime rationing, so completing the subway was not a high priority. The tunnels were suggested as possible air raid shelters, but the idea was never implemented. Underground storage of commercial and military supplies was also proposed as a use for the tunnels, or as a pathway to bring freight into the heart of the city, but both ideas were rejected because they would delay bringing mass transit to Cincinnati. After the war ended the City Planning Commission decided to not include the subway in its plans. Instead, the commission would use the loop's right-of-way as pathways for Interstate 75 and the Norwood Lateral. Then, in the 1950s, a massive water main was laid in the northbound tunnel to save $300,000 by not digging a new tunnel for the water main. According to the engineering firm Parsons Brinckerhoff, a redundant water main was installed during the construction of Fort Washington Way so the water main in the subway could be removed easily. There is also an escape clause in Ordinance No. 154-1956 that states, \\"in the event said section of the rapid transit subway is, at some future date, needed for rapid transit purposes, the Water Works shall remove said main at its sole cost.\\" In the 1960s, Hamilton county proposed the Liberty Street station be turned into a bomb shelter. However, the result was a very weak attempt at a fallout shelter that would not provide much for those residing in it. There were also suggestions by investors to turn the tunnels into passages for freight trains, but that project failed due to the sharp turns existing in the tunnels that freight trains could not handle. The subway bonds were paid off in 1966 at a total cost of $13,019,982.45. Around that time Meier's Wine Cellars Inc. wanted to use the subway tunnels to store wine, as well as install a bottling operation to draw tourists, but it fell through due to a lack of proper building codes. In the 1970s Nick Clooney wanted to turn parts of the tunnel into an underground mall and a night club, but that fell through early on due to insurance issues.Krewedl, Derek. (October 22, 2002) \\"New life for old subway?\\", Downtowner. pp.1,14. In the 1980s the city pitched the tunnels to Hollywood filmmakers as a location to shoot subway scenes. In particular, the location was presented to the makers of Batman Forever, but as of 2008 the tunnels had not been used in any feature films. In 2002, a regional light rail system was proposed to use the tunnels; the system would cost $2.6 billion and take thirty years to build. The tunnels were favored because they were in an ideal location, they could easily be used to connect the east side and the west sides of Cincinnati, and they would have saved the city at least $100 million in construction costs at the time. The light rail plan, called MetroMoves, proposed a tax levy that would have raised sales tax in Hamilton county by a half-cent. The plan was voted down by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, with 68% opposing MetroMoves. Still, an underground portion of the Riverfront Transit Center was built to serve the proposed, unbuilt MetroMoves lines; this transit center was later served by another Cincinnati streetcar line, the Cincinnati Streetcar. In 2017, shortly after the 100th anniversary of the tunnel construction, mayoral candidate Rob Richardson Jr. ran unsuccessfully on a platform that included reviving the subway system; however, this did not provide tangible construction plans or feasibility studies. Current status The uncompleted subway tunnels and stations have been described as \\"in good shape.\\" This is partially credited to the original construction quality, and partially because Cincinnati needs to maintain the tunnel, using tax revenues, due to the presence of Central Parkway on top of it. In 2008 it was estimated that it would cost $2.6 million to simply keep maintaining the tunnels, $19 million to fill the tunnels with dirt, and $100.5 million to revive the tunnels for modern subway use. Relocating the water main would cost $14 million. , the abandoned tunnel is used to carry the relocated water main and some optical fiber cables. The abandoned tunnels are frequented by urban explorers and the homeless. =Stations and route= This tunnel entrance near the Western Hills Viaduct is clearly visible from Interstate 75. Seven stations were completed along Central Parkway: four underground and three above ground. The underground stations remain intact, but the above-ground stations were demolished when I-75 was built in the 1960s. The underground stations' locations are at Race Street, Liberty Street, Linn Street, and Brighton Place, while the above- ground stations' locations were at Marshall Street, Ludlow Avenue, Clifton Avenue, and Reading Road. The first station was the Race Street Station, which was to serve as the main hub. It was configured with the platform in the center, with the subway running along the north and south side. Next was Liberty Street, which was a through-station. It was a simple design with a platform on each side of the track. Third was Linn Street, also a through station. Laid out similarly to Liberty Street, this station has been sealed up, and can be easily missed when walking through. Fourth was Brighton Place, another through-station. Marshall Street was the most grand of the above- ground stations, located to the west near the Mill Creek Valley. Ludlow Avenue Station was constructed under the south side of the Ludlow Viaduct and was also a through-station. The last to be completed was Clifton Avenue, which was located where the street passes under present day I-75. There were additional stations in the plan; however, funding ran out as the project reached Norwood.Cincinnati's Abandoned Subway, (2010). Pro. Paige E. Malott. Dir. Leland Schuler. DVD. Time Bonus Productions, LLC, Cincinnati, OH. =Engineering= The subway tunnels run north and south. Each of the two halves of the tube has a minimum width of and a height of . Each tunnel has parallel wooden stringers which are bolted to the floor, and are intended to support steel rails that were never laid. They are from center to center, which is wider than most railway lines. All curves in the tunnel are gradual, and on those curves the outside stringer was raised higher than the inner stringer to accommodate trains traveling at speeds of more than . There were many details of the unfinished subway system, such as a provision for a station at Mohawk Corner, where the wall has been set back. At Walnut Street the lines begin to curve south to go into downtown, but they are stopped short by a bricked-up wall. The subway tunnel is double-tracked throughout its entire length, with a concrete wall separating the two tracks. Openings in the wall enable persons to step from one track to another. The tunnels are well ventilated and provide much light until Liberty Street is reached.

The congregation was founded in 1869 in Manitowoc, Wisconsin in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee, later part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay. Presently there are about 300 Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity who serve in education, health care, or spiritual direction. They serve throughout the Midwestern and Western United States, as well as in Hawaii. History The origin of the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity can be traced back to Germany. In the spring of 1854, Father Ambrose Oschwald led a party of German immigrants to the United States. Fleeing the upheavals in their homeland, they sought to establish a Catholic community in America. They founded St. Nazianz, Wisconsin, named after St. Gregory of Nazianzus. Joseph Fessler, one of the original members of the community from Baden, studied for the priesthood in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Upon being ordained in November 1865, he was assigned to Immaculate Conception Parish in Clarks Mills. He asked 23-year-old Teresa Gramlich of St. Nazianz, to come and teach catechism. In June 1866, she arrived and took up residence in an old chicken coop across from the church. Teresa taught her pupils in the choir loft. By Christmas time she was joined by two others ‚Äì twelve-year-old Mary Doyle, one of her students, and Magdalen Derler, who served as house-keeper. Joseph Albrecht, was a member of the Missionaries of the Precious Blood. Like Oschwald, Albrecht was from Germany; and like Oschwald led a similar group in search of religious freedom. In October 1866, they stopped in St. Nazianz on their way to Minnesota. When in September 1867 Albrecht's group left for Minnesota, three Sisters of the Precious Blood, Mary Ann Graf, Josepha Thoenig and Rosa Wahl decided to remain behind; they along with Teresa Gramlich began their postulancy for a new religious community forming under the direction of Fr. Fessler. Fr. Fessler sent Mary Ann, Teresa, and Rosa to Milwaukee to study with the School Sisters of Notre Dame under the direction of Mother Caroline, the founder of the School Sisters of Notre Dame in America. Upon their return to the ‚ÄúLittle Nazareth‚Äù of St. Nazianz they received news of Fr. Fessler's transfer to St. Boniface in Manitowoc. So the group followed him there, and it was there on November 4, 1869 that they began their pre-novitiate retreat and were joined by Sophia Fessler, Fr. Fessler's younger sister. November 9, 1869 those five women were received into the Third Order Regular of St. Francis ‚Äì the Founders‚Äô Day of the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity. They received their religious names: Josepha Theonig became Sr. Maria Coletta; Mary Ann Graf became Sr. Mary Hyacintha; Teresa Gramlich became Sr. Maria Gabriela; Sophia Fessler became Sr. Mary Seraphica; and Rosa Wahl became Sr. Mary Odelia, and it was she who was the first superior of the little community. Fr. Joseph Fessler was later assigned as pastor of St. Boniface Church, Manitowoc, in spring, 1868. Mother Odelia Wahl persuaded Fr. Fessler to purchase a property on Silver Lake, near Manitowoc, Wisconsin for the community's motherhouse. The cornerstone was laid July 23, 1873; and the following year, the motherhouse dedicated. In 2007, the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity and The Franciscanized World website were featured in Time Magazine‚Äôs profile of Catholic religious orders innovatively utilizing the Internet.

He was a nephew of Robert the Bruce, who created him as the first Earl of Moray. He was known for successfully capturing Edinburgh Castle from the English, and he was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Arbroath. Early life Thomas was the son of another Thomas, who was Chamberlain of Scotland and Sheriff of Roxburgh, and the grandson of the Randulf or Ranulf who gave the family their surname. It is known that the younger Thomas was the nephew of King Robert the Bruce, his mother was Martha of Kilconquhar, Robert's older half-sister.Bain, Joseph, FSA (Scot)., The Edwards in Scotland, 1296 - 1377, Edinburgh, 1901:61 & 66 The traditional view is that she was of the first marriage of Marjorie of Carrick, who was mother of Robert the Bruce by her second marriage. There has been conjecture that the King's father Robert married again after Marjorie's death and had with his second wife a daughter, Isabel, who married the elder Thomas; however, because Marjorie of Carrick did not die until 1292 and Thomas the younger was at the coronation of John Balliol in 1292, this is impossible.Weis, Fredk., Lewis, et al., The Magna Charta Sureties 1215, 5th edition, Baltimore, 2002: 50Richardson, Douglas, Plantagenet Ancestry, Baltimore, Md., 2004: 682 There is no record of Randolph's date of birth. Although the author of Scots Peerage speculated that Randolph's date of birth was 1278, his grandmother was born in 1253 or 1256, and it is unlikely that he was born when his grandmother was in her early twenties. Therefore, that date has to be called into question. War of Independence Earl Thomas's coat of arms consisted of three cushions within a double tressure. The symbolism of the cushions is not known, but they may have represented wealth and luxury. The tressure was added by Thomas to show his royal connection: the same symbol appeared on King Robert's arms Thomas supported Robert in his attempt to take the throne, and was present at his uncle's coronation in 1306. He was probably knighted by the king then or shortly after.Penman, Michael Robert the Bruce: King of the Scots p. 98 Following the Scottish defeat at the Battle of Methven, he was taken prisoner by the English, coming under the custody first of Sir Adam Gordon and then of the Earl of Lincoln. During his confinement he joined the English cause, and remained attached to them until he was captured by Sir James Douglas in 1307, and persuaded to rejoin the Scottish side. His defection came to the attention of Edward II of England, who forfeited all his lands, bestowing them on his favourite Hugh le Despencer. At an unknown date before 1314, Robert created him Earl of Moray, and he became ruler of a large swathe of land in the north of Scotland, far exceeding his southern possessions. He was also made lord of the Isle of Man, according to the reddendo or charter this was in exchange for six ships of 26 oars and money to the value of 100 merks to be paid at Inverness. Around this time he became one of Robert's most trusted lieutenants, and he seems to have accompanied him on most of his campaigns. His most famous achievement was on 14 March 1314 when he carried out a daring attack on Edinburgh Castle.Tabraham, Christopher, 'Edinburgh Castle Official Souvenir Guide' This was one of a handful of castles in Scotland still in English hands, and stood on top of an apparently unscalable rock. Amongst Moray's men was William Francis, the son of a former governor of the castle, who knew of a secret path up the rock. Moray used this path to reach the castle, and successfully retook it for the Scots. Moray played an important role in the Scottish victory at the Battle of Bannockburn, where he commanded one of the three divisions (schiltrons) of the infantry, the others being commanded by King Robert and Edward Bruce, the king's brother.Barbour, The Bruce, p 216.Ross, David R., James the Good, pp. 61-83.Scott, Ronald McNair, Robert the Bruce, pp. 149-152.Traquair, Peter Freedom's Sword. Collins, 1998. John Barbour, however, said there were four schiltrons, one commanded by James Douglas. Ireland In 1315 Moray accompanied Edward Bruce, the king's brother, during his invasion of Ireland. He was one of the principal leaders in the war against the English settlers in Ireland. He returned twice to Scotland during the war to obtain reinforcements and to get Robert's personal presence in Ireland. Diplomatic career Moray's name appears directly after Robert's on the famous Declaration of Arbroath, which was sent to Pope John XXII by the nobles of Scotland to persuade him to recognise Scotland as an independent nation. Later, in 1324, he was sent to meet the Pope in person at his court in Avignon. At this meeting, Randoph successfully persuaded Pope John to recognise Robert as King of Scots, a major diplomatic coup. The next year the Pope wrote to Moray declaring his hope and trust in his efforts to make peace between England and Scotland and gave permission for him to visit the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Moray was again sent to France in 1325, this time to persuade King Charles IV to sign the Treaty of Corbeil renewing the Franco-Scottish alliance, which he did successfully.Ronald McNair Scott: Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, Hutchinson & Co 1982, p 216 After his return to Scotland, he had a commanding role in the Battle of Stanhope Park against the English. The English suffered a humiliating defeat and were forced to sign the Treaty of Edinburgh‚ÄìNorthampton, by which Scotland's independence was finally acknowledged. Regent During the King's final years, Moray had been a constant companion, and had superintended the household of the young heir to the throne, David. Before his death, Robert decreed that Moray would serve as regent for David, who was only five years old when he succeeded as king. Moray performed this role justly and wisely, but died at Musselburgh three years later on 20 July 1332, while on his way to repel an invasion by Edward Balliol and his supporters. At the time it was said that he had been poisoned by the English, but some modern historians believe that it is more likely that he died from a kidney stone. His successor as regent was Donald, Earl of Mar. Marriage and family Thomas married Isabel, only daughter of Margaret and John Stewart of Bonkyll (killed at the Battle of Falkirk), a brother of James, High Steward of Scotland.Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, Edinburgh, 1867, vol.vii: 200.Mackenzie, A.M., M.A., D.Litt., The Rise of the Stewarts, London, 1935: 14n.Simpson, David, The Genealogical and Chronological History of the Stuarts, Edinburgh, 1713: 64-5.

Four sailors were killed and the ship suffered some damage, but she stayed afloat, got out of the line of fire, and returned unassisted to Ashdod for repairs. The ship was repaired and resumed its combat role three weeks later. IAF Eurocopter AS565, the type of helicopter used on the Sa'ar 5 class An investigation into the attack by the Israeli Navy concluded that the missile was an Iranian version of the Chinese C-802, which hit a crane in the rear of the ship. The ship's radar system was not fully functional at the time, and both the ECM and the Barak anti-missile systems were in a two-minute stand-by mode. An officer ordered that the anti-missile defenses be switched off about an hour prior to the attack without notifying the captain. The decision took into account intelligence assessments that Hezbollah did not have the capability to hit Israeli warships. The partial sensor shutdowns were known by the officer responsible, but the captain was not informed.

Plot The film opens with a woman and child, Kelly and Joanne, bursting into a London toilet. Joanne is crying and Kelly has a black eye. Eventually Kelly gets them on a train to Brighton, and it is clear they are running from someone. Joanne is an eleven-year-old runaway who is procured by a reluctant Kelly into having sex with an old violent mobster who is a paedophile. Kelly's pimp, Derek, bullies her into complying, but it all goes horribly wrong, and the old mobster is killed, presumably by one of the girls. The older man's son, Stuart, then forces Derek to find the girls. The film follows the duo's flight from London in the wake of what has happened. Arriving initially in Brighton, Kelly visits her friend Karen and tries to earn enough money through prostituting herself to help Joanne afford the train to Devon, where the child's grandmother lives. The two are eventually tracked down by her pimp and his associate and taken to meet Stuart at a secluded field. Upon arrival, Kelly's pimp and associate are made to dig two graves, presumably for the girls. However, Stuart decides that the girls are the victims in this episode and decides instead to kill Kelly's pimp and associate. The film ends with Kelly and Joanne arriving at Joanne's grandma's house in Devon. Kelly watches from a distance as the girl and the grandmother hug, then turns away.

This leads to an inconsistency in the theory because the space of configurations which is being integrated over in the functional integral involves both a configuration and the same configuration after a large gauge transformation has acted upon it and the sum of all such contributions is zero and the space of configurations cannot be split into connected components for which the integral is nonzero. Alternatively, the existence of a global anomaly implies that the measure of Feynman's functional integral cannot be defined globally. The adjective \\"global\\" refers to the properties of a group that are not visible locally. For example, all features of a discrete group (as opposed to a Lie group) are global in character. A famous example is an SU(2) Yang‚ÄìMills theory in 4D with an odd number of chiral fermions transforming as doublets under SU(2). Many types of global anomalies must cancel for a theory to be consistent. An example is modular invariance, the requirement of anomaly cancellation for a part of a gravitational anomaly that deals with the large diffeomorphisms over two dimensional worldsheets of genus 1 or more.

She was strong promoter and defender of modern art in her country, her artworks are present in museums in Ireland. Her work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Life Jellett was born on 29 April 1897 at 36 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, the daughter of William Morgan Jellett, a barrister and later MP, and Janet McKenzie Stokes. Her aunt was a pioneering woman doctor working in India, Eva Jellett. Jellett's art education began at a young age of 11, when she received painting lessons from Elizabeth Yeats, Sarah Celia Harrison and from Miss Manning who had a studio on Merrion Row, and whose influence on Irish Artists of the time was considerable. She later studied at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin (her teachers included William Orpen, and his influence is apparent in her work from this period). Despite her artistic talent, she was still undecided about her future, and at this time was taking regular piano lessons with a view to becoming a concert Pianist. Her decision to become a painter was made after working under Walter Sickert at the Westminster Technical Institute in London, where she enrolled in 1917 and remained until 1919. She showed precocious talent as an artist in the impressionist style. In 1920, she won the Taylor Art Scholarship worth ¬£50. The same year she submitted work to the annual exhibition of the Royal Hibernian Academy. Mainie Jellett, Abstract Composition, 1935, oil on canvas, 119.5 x 96.9 cm In 1921, along with her companion Evie Hone moved to Paris, where, working under Andr√© Lhote and Albert Gleizes she encountered cubism and began an exploration of non-representational art. Her new style, including colour and rhythm was greatly inspired by her stay in France. After 1921 she and Evie Hone returned to Dublin but for the next decade they continued to spend part of each year in Paris. In a 1943 essay entitled 'Definition of my Art' Jellett describes her art as having three revolutions inspired by her teachers; the first credited to Walter Sickert, the second to Andr√© Lhote and the third to Albert Gleizes. In 1923, she exhibited two cubist paintings at the Dublin Painters' Exhibition. The response was hostile, with the Irish Times publishing a photograph of one of the paintings and quoting their art critic as saying of them 'to me they presented an insoluble puzzle'. The following year, she and Evie Hone had their first joint exhibition. A deeply committed Christian, her paintings, though strictly non-representational, often have religious titles and often resemble icons in tone and palate. In Irish Art, a Concise History Bruce Arnold writes that :\\"Many of her abstracts are built up from a central 'eye' or 'heart' in arcs of colour, help up and together by the rhythm of line and shape, and given depth and intensity - a sense of abstract perspective - by the basic understanding of light and colour\\" Jellett was an important figure in Irish art history, both as an early proponent of abstract art and as a champion of the modern movement. Her painting was often attacked critically but she proved eloquent in defense of her ideas. Along with Evie Hone, Louis le Brocquy, Jack Hanlon and Norah McGuinness, Jellett co-founded the Irish Exhibition of Living Art in 1944. Achill Horses, oil on canvas, 61 x 92 cm, 1939, National Galley of Ireland In her published work \\"An Approach To Painting\\" (1942)  Jellett stated why she feels artists are necessary in society: \\"The idea of an artist being a special person, an exotic flower set apart from other people is one of the errors resulting from the industrial revolution, and the fact of artists being pushed out of their lawful position in the life and society of the present day. ‚Ä¶ Their present enforced isolation from the majority is a very serious situation and I believe it is one of the many causes which has resulted in the present chaos we live in. The art of a nation is one of the ultimate facts by which its spiritual health is judged and appraised by posterity.\\" She was an important participant of the Active Age project in the IMMA, which was produced to rewrite the narrative of art change the canon. Jellett whose work was not very well known outside of Ireland but a pioneer when it comes to the idea of avant-garde and being an activist for the encouragement of young Irish artists. The IMMA decides to evaluate and reexamine the European canon and bringing artists like Maine Jellett to the front line. In 1991 Bruce Arnold published a comprehensive biography of Jellett together with an analysis of the modern movement in Ireland. Arnold, Bruce. Mainie Jellett and the Modern Movement in Ireland. Yale University Press, 1991. . Death Jellett died on 16 February 1944, aged 46, of pancreatic cancer.Elizabeth Bowen wrote a heartfelt obitruary which was publish in the periodical The Bell in 1944. She mentions one of their last talks and Jellett mentions the work of a genius Dorothy Richardson, who has yet to receive the recognition she deserves.

Unfortunately, this work does not have a date to determine when its artistic career was created, whether at the beginning or at the end of it. The focal point of the painting is Christ, placed in the center of the painting where the light is concentrated. The use of colors consistent with reality and perspective is appreciated. Likewise, Jellett's analysis of the image of the human body to find its geometric elements is observed. Four Element Composition 1925, IMMA This work was created by Jellett four years after her stay in Paris and her foray into non- figurative art. The title of this painting works as a kind of anchor, since it helps to understand what Jellett wanted to represent, such as the crossing of cold colors, points, lines and forms where each one has its own expression. It is a work that exists independently of reality, loaded with significance of the abstract. Composition 1932-1935, Ulster Museum This work was created by Jellett in her maturity, the idea of pure abstraction is appreciated. It does not represent a figurative theme or subject, it has an autonomous visual language, with its own meaning. It exists regardless of reality and of any historical, cultural or geographical burden. The painting is composed by the preponderant combination of curved lines that generates spatial shapes. Likewise, chromatic freedom is appreciated using terracotta, red, gray, blue, yellow, white and black colors.

History =Origins= As a secret society, the origins and history of the Green Gang are complex. The society has its roots in the Luojiao, a Buddhist sect founded by Luo Qing in the mid- Ming dynasty; during the early 18th century in the Qing dynasty, the sect was introduced among workers involved in the transport of grain along the Grand Canal via the efforts of three sworn brothers: Weng Yan (ÁøÅÂ≤©), Qian Jian (Èí±Âùö) and Pan Qing (ÊΩòÊ∏Ö). Luoist groups mixed with the pre-existing societies for grain transport boatmen along the Canal, providing services such as burials and hostels, and also served as a social organization for the boatmen. However, they were perceived as a threat by the authorities, and in 1768 the Qianlong Emperor ordered the destruction of Luoist temples and proscribed the sect. This had the effect of driving the sect underground, where it became centred on the grain fleets themselves. During the upheavals of the 19th century, including the Taiping Rebellion and the change in course of the Yellow River around 1855, the shipment of grain along the Grand Canal was severely disrupted and finally ended. This again scattered the boatmen, who either joined local rebellions like the Taiping and Nian rebellions, or shifted to the coast to join the salt smuggling trade. In northern Jiangsu Province in the 1870s, boatmen and salt smugglers began to organize into what was called the Anqing Daoyou (ÂÆâÊ∏ÖÈÅìÂèã, literally \\"Friends of the Way of Tranquility and Purity\\"), which was the direct precursor to the Green Gang in the early 20th century. =Appearance in Shanghai= Shanghai became a favourable place for criminal activity, and the Green Gang in particular, due to several factors. As the Grand Canal fell out of use for grain shipments, replaced by the sea route, Shanghai became an important transshipment point for grain; at the same time, as one of the treaty ports, it was a gateway for foreign trade, including in opium. The presence of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession, which were under different jurisdictions and administrations, also made for a disjointed legal environment that favoured organised crime. Finally, massive Chinese immigration into Shanghai meant that associations based on common ancestral hometowns or sworn loyalties became important factors of Shanghai social life, and the Green Gang worked through these networks. For example, Du Yuesheng, who would become one of the most prominent Green Gang leaders in Shanghai, was introduced to Huang Jinrong, an earlier leader, because his mentor was a native of Suzhou like Huang. File:Huang Jinyong.jpgHuang Jinrong File:Du Yuesheng2.jpgDu Yuesheng =Prominence in Shanghai= By the 20th century it had acquired such wealth and power that it had become corrupt, and included many successful businessmen. Under Du Yuesheng, it controlled the criminal activities in the entire city of Shanghai. The Green Gang focused on opium (which was supported by local warlords), extortion, gambling, and prostitution. Shanghai was considered by some the vice capital of the world at that time. The Green Gang was often hired by Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang to break up union meetings and labor strikes and was also involved in the Chinese Civil War. One of the leaders of the Green Gang, Ying Guixin, was also involved in Yuan Shikai's assassination of the rival politician Song Jiaoren in 1913. Carrying the name of the Society for Common Progress,Wilber, C.M. (1985) The Nationalist Revolution in China, 1923 -1928, Cambridge University Press, p.104 it was ‚Äî along with other criminal gangs ‚Äî responsible for the White Terror massacre of approximately 5,000 pro-Communist strikers in Shanghai in April 1927, which was ordered by Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek.Mitter, R. (2004) A Bitter Revolution: China's Struggle With the Modern World, Oxford University Press, p145 Chiang granted Du Yuesheng the rank of general in the National Revolutionary Army later. The Green Gang was a major financial supporter of Chiang Kai-shek, who became acquainted with the gang when he lived in Shanghai from 1915 to 1923.\\"For two years (1916‚Äì17) he lived in Shanghai, where he apparently belonged to the Green Gang (Qing Bang), a secret society involved in financial manipulations.\\" (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica entry for Chiang Kai- Shek) The Green Gang shared its profits from the drug trade with the Kuomintang after the creation of the Opium Suppression Bureau. Chiang Kai- shek's brother-in-law and financial minister T. V. Soong also partnered with the pro-Chiang Green Gang to pressure Shanghai banks to buy up national securities. In the last two years of the Nanjing Decade, the Green Gang continued to pressure big business to buy up national bonds, as a means of compensating for the lack of corporate tax imposed by the government.Taylor, J. (2014) \\"Chiang Kai-shek and Chinese Modernization\\", First Printing, p. 40 =Last years in Hong Kong= After the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in 1949, the Green Gang left Shanghai and in the early 1950s opened heroin refineries in Hong Kong. In the following years, the organization suffered in struggles against local syndicates over the control of the drug market. By the mid 1950s it had disappeared. Control of the heroin market was then taken by small syndicates of ethnic Chaozhou hailing from the nearby coastal town of Swatow. They used the Green Gang's chemists and expanded the consumption of heroin in Hong Kong. In the early 1960s they spread their influence in South- East Asia and by the end of the decade Hong Kong chemists inaugurated the first laboratory of high-grade no. 4 heroin along the border between Thailand and Burma, introducing the technology that made the Golden Triangle the largest heroin producer in the world.

For example, a square possesses discrete rotational symmetry, as only rotations by multiples of right angles will preserve the square's original appearance. Discrete symmetries sometimes involve some type of 'swapping', these swaps usually being called reflections or interchanges. In mathematics and theoretical physics, a discrete symmetry is a symmetry under the transformations of a discrete group‚Äîe.g. a topological group with a discrete topology whose elements form a finite or a countable set. One of the most prominent discrete symmetries in physics is parity symmetry.

Scope The number of ministries in the cabinet has changed over time, some ministries were abolished, others combined with others or degraded to state committees or agencies. Each ministry is in charge of other government sub-departments. There are three basic types of government sub-departments known as \\"central offices (organs) of executive authority\\": services, agencies, inspections. Beside the basic government sub-departments there also other government sub- departments which were granted a special status. Among such sub-departments there are various government committees, government commissions, government funds, and other institutions. Sub-departments may be elevated to ministerial status by their reorganization and, vice versa, government ministries may degraded to sub-departments (e.g. Ministry of Emergencies was degraded to a sub-department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs).

America Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327 (4th Cir. 1997), The opinion of the Fourth Circuit cert. denied, ,[] Bound Volume number 524 of the U.S. Supreme Court is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit determined the immunity of Internet service providers for wrongs committed by their users under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). Section 230(c)(1) of the CDA provides that \\"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\\"US CODE: Title 47,230. Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material The Fourth Circuit held that each of the plaintiff's claims was barred by the CDA, holding that Section 230 \\"creates a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service.\\" In the words of the Zeran court:  Facts  On April 25, 1995, six days after the Oklahoma City bombing, a message was anonymously posted on America Online's (AOL) \\"Michigan Military Movement\\" bulletin board advertising items with slogans glorifying the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Opinion of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia Zeran's briefing to the Fourth Circuit These items included slogans such as, \\"Visit Oklahoma ... It's a BLAST!!!\\", \\"Putting the kids to bed ... Oklahoma 1995\\", and \\"McVeigh for President 1996\\". Persons interested in making a purchase were instructed to call the plaintiff, Kenneth M. Zeran, whose home phone number was posted in the message but who had neither posted the message nor had anything to do with the content of the ad. Shortly after the posting of the messages, Zeran began receiving a barrage of threatening calls. He contacted AOL to have the message removed, which they soon did. After the removal of the message, however, another was anonymously posted advertising that the shirts had \\"SOLD OUT\\" and that items with new slogans had been made available. The new shirts included slogans such as \\"Forget the rescue, let the maggots take over - Oklahoma 1995\\", and \\"Finally a day care center that keeps the kids quiet - Oklahoma 1995\\". Zeran again contacted AOL to have the message removed from the bulletin board, which they again did. At this point, per AOL's recommendation, Zeran contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation; however, for the next week, new messages continued to appear. On May 1, 1995, the number of calls and threats rose to a crescendo when a conservative radio personality known as Mark Shannon read the message on an Oklahoma City radio station, KRXO, then owned by Diamond Broadcasting. The opinion of the court in Zeran v. Diamond Broadcasting At this point, Zeran's house was placed under protective surveillance, and he was unable to use his telephone for his home business, as the threatening calls were coming in approximately every two minutes. This continued until at least May 15, by which time the number of calls reduced to only approximately 15 per day. On January 4, 1996, Zeran filed suit against Diamond Broadcasting, and in April of the same year, he filed a separate suit against AOL.  Lower Court ruling  In this suit, Kenneth M. Zeran alleged that as a distributor, AOL was \\"negligent in failing to respond adequately to the bogus notices on its bulletin board after being made aware of their malicious and fraudulent nature.\\" In Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc., the court found that \\"a defendant could not be held liable for distributing defamatory statements unless it knew or had reason to know of statements.\\" In this case, since AOL did not dispute its knowledge of the defamatory statements, Zeran claimed to have grounds for alleging their liability for defamation. In response to this claim, AOL alleged that the CDA preempted the 1991 holding of Cubby v. CompuServe, and that as a result, the CDA should hold sway. Since the CDA was enacted in February 1996, after the defamatory messages were posted on AOL's bulletin board, the questions at issue in the lower court ruling were determined to be: = Preemption of the state negligence claim by the CDA = In analyzing the preemption of the state laws, the court determined that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution demands preemption of state laws where they conflict with federal laws. The court analyzed three ways in which the state and federal laws could conflict: # Impossibility of compliance with both state and federal law # Conflict of language between state and federal law # Conflict between the state law and the \\"purposes and objectives of Congress\\" In analyzing the first theory of direct conflict, the court found that AOL could \\"comply with the CDA even if it is subjected to state liability for negligent distribution of defamatory material,\\" and thus found that the federal law did not preempt the state laws. With regard to the second and third theories of conflict however, the court found that the CDA did preempt the state laws. Based on the findings of Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc., which found that CompuServe \\"was a distributor for the purposes of defamation liability,\\" Zeran contended that AOL was a distributor of information, not a publisher, and because ¬ß230(c)(1) of the CDA spoke specifically to publishers, Zeran alleged that there was not a conflict between the two statutes. The court found, however, that distributors are a subset of publishers, and that as a result the CDA conflicted with the state defamation law, thus preempting it. In their analysis of the third theory of state and federal conflict, the court stated that, > Congress' clear objective in passing ¬ß230 of the CDA was to encourage the > development of technologies, procedures and techniques by which > objectionable material could be blocked or deleted. Since distributor liability would have the effect of disincentivizing the filtering of content by third parties, the court found that such laws were in conflict with the \\"purpose and objectives of congress,\\" and were thus preempted. = Retroactive application of the CDA = Zeran's final claim was that even if the state laws are preempted by the CDA, it should not provide immunity to AOL in this case because the messages were posted on the AOL bulletin board before the CDA's enactment. In analyzing this claim, the court used the Landgraf test, which states that \\"a court must ... determine whether Congress has clearly expressed [a] statute's intended temporal reach.\\" To this question, the court pointed out that in ¬ß230(d)(3) of the CDA, Congress has provided such a clear expression, stating that, \\"no cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.\\" It reasons that since \\"no cause of action may be brought,\\" the timing of the posting of the message is immaterial, and the CDA must apply retroactively.  Appeals  After reviewing the proceedings of the lower court, the Fourth Circuit again granted judgment in favor of AOL. In this case, Zeran again claimed a distinction between distributors and publishers, citing Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc. and Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co. In those cases, such a distinction was made, however the court opines that \\"[Zeran] misapprehends ... the significance of that distinction for the legal issue we consider here.\\" In the opinion of the court, distributors are a subset of publishers, and are thus protected under ¬ß230 of the CDA. The second claim Zeran made on appeal was again that the CDA should not apply retroactively. Again the court cited ¬ß230(d)(3) of the CDA, which reads that \\"No cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.\\" The court believed that this statute indicated that, \\"Congress clearly expressed its intent that the statute apply to any complaint instituted after its effective date,\\" and that therefore any issue of retroactivity was moot. After having lost at the district court and on appeal, Zeran, making similar allegations as above, Tech Law Journal: Zeran Certiorari Petition petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. On June 22, 1998, the court declined to hear his case.

Bursian attributes the first to Menander, whom he placed in the 4th century, and the second to an anonymous rhetorician of Alexandria Troas, who possibly lived in the time of Diocletian. Others, from the superscription of the Paris manuscript, assign the first to Genethlius of Petra in Palestine.

It states that \\"space-time and internal symmetries cannot be combined in any but a trivial way\\".; Jeffrey E. Mandula (2015). \\"Coleman-Mandula theorem\\" Scholarpedia 10(2):7476. Since \\"realistic\\" theories contain a mass gap, the only conserved quantities, apart from the generators of the Poincar√© group, must be Lorentz scalars. Description Every quantum field theory satisfying the assumptions, # Below any mass M, there are only finite number of particle types # Any two-particle state undergoes some reaction at almost all energies # The amplitude for elastic two body scattering are analytic functions of scattering angle at almost all energies, and that has non-trivial interactions can only have a Lie group symmetry which is always a direct product of the Poincar√© group and an internal group if there is a mass gap: no mixing between these two is possible. As the authors say in the introduction to the 1967 publication, \\"We prove a new theorem on the impossibility of combining space-time and internal symmetries in any but a trivial way.\\"Valuing Negativity  Cosmic Variance Limitations =Different spacetime symmetries= The first condition for the theorem is that the unified group \\"G contains a subgroup locally isomorphic to the Poincare group.\\" Therefore, the theorem only makes a statement about the unification of the Poincare group with an internal symmetry group. However, if the Poincare group is replaced with a different spacetime symmetry, for example, with the de Sitter group the theorem no longer holds, an infinite number of massless bosonic Higher Spin fields is required to exist however In addition, if all particles are massless the Coleman‚ÄìMandula theorem allows a combination of internal and spacetime symmetries, because the spacetime symmetry group is then the conformal group. =Spontaneous symmetry breaking= Note that this theorem only constrains the symmetries of the S-matrix itself. As such, it places no constraints on spontaneously broken symmetries which do not show up directly on the S-matrix level. In fact, it is easy to construct spontaneously broken symmetries (in interacting theories) which unify spatial and internal symmetries. =Discreteness= This theorem also only applies to discrete Lie algebras and not continuous Lie groups. As such, it does not apply to discrete symmetries or globally for Lie groups. As an example of the latter, we might have a model where a rotation by œÑ (a discrete spacetime symmetry) is an involutive internal symmetry which commutes with all the other internal symmetries. If there is no mass gap, it could be a tensor product of the conformal algebra with an internal Lie algebra. But in the absence of a mass gap, there are also other possibilities. For example, quantum electrodynamics has vector and tensor conserved charges. See infraparticle for more details. =Supersymmetry= Supersymmetry may be considered a possible \\"loophole\\" of the theorem because it contains additional generators (supercharges) that are not scalars but rather spinors. This loophole is possible because supersymmetry is a Lie superalgebra, not a Lie algebra. The corresponding theorem for supersymmetric theories with a mass gap is the Haag‚Äì≈Åopusza≈Ñski‚ÄìSohnius theorem. Quantum group symmetry, present in some two- dimensional integrable quantum field theories like the sine-Gordon model, exploits a similar loophole. Generalization for Higher Spin Symmetry It was proven that conformal theories with higher-spin symmetry are not compatible with interactions.

Punta is the best-known dance of the Garifunas. Punta is also known as banguity in Nicaragua. Before the arrival of the Garifuna people in Punta Gorda, Roatan, Honduras on April 12, 1797. The first album of recorded traditional punta music was released originally in 1955. Sambunango was made famous by Gatos Bravos of Honduras with a song released in 1987; it's known as the first commercially produced punta music song from Honduras. The most famous song of punta music is Sopa De Caracol;. The song was originally written by Belizean singer Hernan \\"Chico\\" Ramos. The diaspora of Garinagu people, commonly called the \\"Garifuna Nation\\", dates back to the amalgamation of West African slaves and the Arawak and Carib Amerindians. Punta is used to reaffirm and express the struggle felt by the indigenous population's common heritage through cultural art forms, such as dance and music, and to highlight their strong sense of endurance. Besides Belize, punta also has a following in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Southern Mexico and the United States. Lyrics may be in Garifuna, Kriol, English or Spanish.Greene, Oliver N., Jr. 2004. \\"Ethnicity, modernity, and retention in the Garifuna punta\\". Black Music Research Journal 22, no. 2: 189-216.Punta Dance and Punta Songs However, most songs are performed in the indigenous Arawak and Carib-based languages of the Garinagu and are often simply contemporary adaptations of traditional Garifuna songs. Being the most popular dance in Garifuna culture,Rosenberg, Dan. 1998. Parrandalised. Folk Roots 20 nos. 2-3: 47-51. punta can be performed at wakes, holidays, parties, ancestral celebrations, and other social events.Belize Music - The Garifunas. Belize.com Ltd, 2008. Web. 13 May 2010. Punta is iconic of Garifuna ethnicity and modernity, and can be seen as a poetic folk art that connects older cultures and rhythms with new sounds. Chumba and hunguhungu, circular dances in triple rhythm, are often combined with punta. Origins and historical context In their culture, the people refer to themselves as both Garinagu and Garifuna, with Garifuna mainly pertaining to their culture, music, and dance rather than using it to identify their people. There are a variety of possible origins of the punta's intended meaning for the Garifuna dance and music it represents. The word punta is a Latinization of an ancient West African rhythm called bunda, or \\"buttocks\\" in the Mand√© language. Another possibility refers to punta in the Spanish meaning \\"from point to point\\", referring to the tips of one's toes or to the movement from place to place. The Punta dance is performed by a man and a woman who evolve separately in a circle formed by the spectators. They begin facing each other and the figure varies with the ingenuity of the dancers, but always represents the evolution of a courtship in which first the man pursues, and then the woman, while the other retreats; and ends only when one of them, from exhaustion or from lack of further initiative, admits defeat by retiring from the ring, to have his or her place immediately taken by another. Punta dance is a mimetic cock-and-hen mating dance with rapid movements of the buttocks, hips, and feet, while the upper torso remains motionless. Couples attempt to dance more stylistically and seductively, with better hip movements, than their competitors. As the evening progresses, the Punta became extremely ‚Äúhot‚Äù; while the spectators egged on their favorites with cries of: m√≠gira-ba labu, ‚Äúdon't leave (off) under him!‚Äù or: m√≠gira-ba tabu, ‚Äúdon't leave (off) under her!‚Äù which has the same effect as, ‚Äúdon't let him (or her) beat you!‚Äù Over time due to their difficult history, music and dance became a way to explain their daily lives and surroundings, a vehicle to communicate Garifuna struggles and ideas, and an antidote to celebrate life and release Garifuna pain. \\"While punta the song form symbolizes the retention of culture through music, punta the dance form symbolizes the continuity of life.\\" The basic dance appeals across lines of gender and age, whether it is expressed in its original, more conservative manner with gentle swaying hips that imply sexual desire, or the more aggressive, provocative manner that emulates sex. The constantly pulsating rhythms represent the most direct and physical form of intimacy, which attracts people of various ethnicities as well. Punta rituals have been observed on holidays such as Christmas Eve and New Year's Day by anthropologist Cynthia Chamberlain Bianchi during her study in the late 1970s-mid 1980s. More commonly were the religious or ancestral rituals, as those seen on the ninth-night wakes by anthropologist Nancie Gonzales during her fieldwork in Central America. If a death occurred at night, then the wake would begin early the next morning and continue all day, ending with a burial in the late afternoon. However, if the death were during the day, an all-night wake would ensue with people coming and going throughout, with prayers and drinking being a familiar sight. Punta dancing can be considered a salient feature of the all-night watches and was mandatory for many participants. Gonzales reflected on her work and other anthropologists', such as Virginia Kearns, concluding that similar evidence has been found in Belize, as well as her own in Honduras, that most punta dancing and story telling was kept until the ninth-night wake, rather than included at any time. Punta music is well known for its call and response patterns and rhythmic drumming that reflects an African and Amerindian origin. The Garinagu people say that their music is not about feeling or emotion, as in most other Latin American nations, but more so about events and dealing with the world around them. A Garifuna elder, Rutilia Figueroa, states: \\"The Garifuna sing their pain. They sing about their concerns. They sing about what‚Äôs going on. We dance when there is a death. It‚Äôs a tradition [meant] to bring a little joy to the family, but every song has a different meaning. Different words. The Garifuna does not sing about love. The Garifuna sings about things that reach your heart.\\" Role of women During her field study in southern Belize from 1974 to 1976, Virginia Kerns witnessed the women's roles and participation in punta first hand. She recalls: \\"During the course of the singing, one woman distributes rum to the others present. Later, feeling the full effects of several drinks, the women begin to dance punta and the atmosphere grows increasingly festive. Outside, the inevitable crowd of spectators gathers, mainly young adults and children, who hover on the periphery at such ritual events.\\" She also notes that the length of the dancing can go on as long as the next afternoon, depending on the supply of rum and the enthusiasm of the dancers. In a more recent study done in 2009, Amy Serrano took a closer look at Garinagu roots and influence within New Orleans. She notes that during some performances the men partake and the women watch, while others involve both men and women interacting and dancing or solely women performing. These influences can be seen in the call and response aspect of punta, as well as the dancing and playing of the instruments. While men in the Garifuna community tend to learn their customs through informal apprenticeships in New Orleans, women consciously conserve and pass on the cultural dances and songs to the younger generations through storytelling. This continuing practice resembles the past, like when the Garifuna first arrived in Honduras and the women cultivated the homes where West African and indigenous spirituality merged with the Catholic religion into their emerging Garifuna folk expression, and above all, within family, ritual, and celebration. To clarify this statement from Serrano's research, \\"Juan M. Sambula, a former community activist from Honduras who recently came to New Orleans for reconstruction work shares the following: 'For us, the women are dedicated to the children and the church because customs we have are based on the Gari tribe of Africa, mixed with Arawak. So I think that the mother's role in this case is different because she is dedicated to the children and the church while the man is dedicated to his friends.' \\" Instruments The music of punta involves responsorial singing accompanied by indigenous membranophones, idiophones, and aerophones. Membranophones are instruments that create sound through a vibrating skin or vellum stretched over an opening, as in all drums. Idiophones are instruments that produce sound through the vibrating of a solid material that is free of tension, commonly found in shakers, scrapers, and xylophones. Aerophones are instruments that create sound through vibrating air within a column or tube, like pipes and horns. Other instruments used in the Garifuna culture include calabash rattles called shakkas (chaka) and conch-shell trumpets. The two principle Garifuna instruments are single-headed drums known as the primera and segunda. The primera, or the lead tenor drum, is the smaller of the two. This drum is used as the drummer contrives a series of rhythms key to punta. The segunda is the bass drum. The drummer playing this instrument repeats a single duple-meter ostinato throughout the song. While the second drum plays steady, the first drum and the other instruments like the maracas and conch shell improvise solos similar to those in a jazz song. The punta ritual for a wake is sung in Garifuna, with a soloist and a chorus. Although punta music may sound happy, the words can often be sad. One song can be translated as, \\"Yesterday you were well. Last night you caught a fever. Now in the morning you are dead.\\" Evolution and changes in Punta From its original context, punta has been transformed by time and modernity. Before, punta consisted of a dance between a man and woman, where they competed against each other by shaking their hips and moving their feet to the beat of a drum. This theme of sensuality and intimacy was considered inappropriate for children, who were excluded from the ritual. Now, it is much more common to see children participate in and view a punta dance. Another change that has been developing in the past century has come in the increasing role of women as singers and drummers, which were thought to be solely male roles and women were only allowed to play if there were no men available. Women have expanded their influence in punta, as well as punta rock, although punta rock does still involve more male-oriented arrangements and performances. Punta also was formerly performed in ancestral celebrations and religious rituals of the recently deceased, but can now be seen in all forms of celebrations, such as birthday parties, communions, or holiday gatherings as a sense of cultural expression. Traditional punta music was also played with two wooden drums, a conch shell, and a type of maracas. Today, acoustical and electric instruments have been added to create \\"punta rock\\", which has become a main export of the Garinagu and grown in popularity across Central America and into the United States. The double-meter rhythm of punta is the primary basis for punta rock. Punta rock is a musical craze that began in the early 1980s and persists today among young adults in the Garifuna communities of Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Andy Palacio, a homegrown Belizean artist, believes that punta rock is \\"a mix of Garifuna rhythms with a little bit of reggae, a little bit of R&B;, and a little bit of rock and roll\\". Although punta rock has achieved national attention for the modern Garifuna youth, it has not replaced the original punta music. Punta is believed to coexist with punta rock, and maintains its significance as the primary musical genre of social commentary. Popular Punta and Punta rock bands \\"Punta served as a paradigm for a new language of musical expression (punta rock) as well as a continuum for the revolution of popular contemporary Garifuna music in general\\". Modernity and punta exist simultaneously as interdependent and interrelated scales of technological and musical transformation, with modernity as the epicenter for the evolution of punta, serving as the medium through which the effects of modernity can be seen. This transformation has also allowed punta rock and punta to appeal to different age groups and be used in a variety of social contexts. Musician and visual artist Pen Cayetano and the Turtle Shell Band introduced punta rock in 1978, at 5 Moho Street, Dangriga, Belize. His songs in the Garifuna language added electric guitar to the traditional punta rhythm.Ryan, Jennifer. 1995. \\"The Garifuna and Creole culture of Belize explosion of punta rock\\", in Popular Music: Style and Identity, ed. Will Straw, Stacey Johnson, Rebecca Sullivan, Paul Friedlander, and Gary Kennedy, pp. 243-248. Cayetano's style caught on quickly in Belize and from there spread to Garifuna communities in Honduras and Guatemala. Young progressive Garifuna men and women who looked to American style and did not carry on traditions experienced a resurgence of their culture. More artists began composing Garifuna songs to traditional Garifuna rhythms. Their lyrics gave the political, social and economic issues of Belizean Garifuna people a global platform and inspired a new generation to apply their talents to their own ancestral forms and unique concerns. Punta musicians in Central America, the US, and elsewhere made further advances with the introduction of the piano, woodwind, brass and string instruments. Punta rock has grown since the early 1980s to include other electronic instruments such as the synthesizer and electric bass guitar as well as other percussive instruments. Punta along with Reggaeton music are predominantly popular and influential among the entire population in Honduras. Often mixed with Spanish, Punta has a widespread audience due to the immigration of Hondurans and Guatemalans to the United States, other parts of Latin America and Europe, notably Spain. Honduran Punta has caused Belizean and Guatemalan Punta to use more Spanish due to the commercial success achieved by bands that use it. When Banda Blanca of Honduras sold over 3 million copies of \\"Sopa De Caracol\\" (\\"Conch Soup\\"), originally written by Belizean Chico Ramos, the Garifunas of Belize felt cheated but celebrated the success. The genre is continuing to develop a strong following in the United States and South America and the Caribbean. Belizean punta is distinctive from traditional punta in that songs are usually in Kriol or Garifuna and rarely in Spanish or English. calypso and soca have had some effect on it. Like calypso and soca, Belizean punta provides social commentary and risqu√© humor, though the initial wave of punta acts eschewed the former. Calypso Rose, Lord Rhaburn and the Cross Culture Band assisted the acceptance of punta by Belizean Kriol people by singing calypso songs about punta - songs such as \\"Gumagrugu Watah\\" and \\"Punta Rock Eena Babylon\\". Prominent broadcasters of Punta music include WAVE Radio and Krem Radio. Punta and Garifuna culture beyond Central America Garifuna culture has grown and transcended national borders through punta's integrative expression of ethnic identity through music, dance, and language in Central America and the United States. Currently, the largest population of the estimated 200,000 transnational Garfiuna people can be found in Honduras (90,000), with smaller populations in Belize (15,000), Guatemala (6,000), and another several thousand scattered in South America and almost 50,000 living in North America. Three areas of larger Garifuna presences include New York City, Miami, New Orleans and mainly Houston. Though sometimes they go unnoticed in the larger aspect of their communities in America, the Garinagu continue to preserve their language, customs, cuisine, and renowned storytelling through their diverse and unique music and dance styles. In 2001, UNESCO proclaimed the Garifuna language and culture to be ‚Äúa masterpiece of oral and intangible heritage of humanity‚Äù, in recognition of the risk of an endangered status and loss of such an interesting culture. The Garifuna communities use punta dance and music to continue their culture and to teach younger generations of their ancestry. This tradition instills a sense of pride and gives the younger generation a tangible identity to cling to in an environment where globalization can overpower smaller cultures.

Early life and career Of Portuguese Jewish extraction, Mend√®s was born in Bordeaux. After childhood and adolescence in Toulouse, he arrived in Paris in 1859 and quickly became one of the prot√©g√©s of the poet Th√©ophile Gautier. He promptly attained notoriety with the publication in the La Revue fantaisiste (1861) of his Roman d'une nuit, for which he was condemned to a month's imprisonment and a fine of 500 francs. He was allied with Parnassianism from the beginning of the movement and displayed extraordinary metrical skill in his first volume of poems, Philom√©la (1863). His critics have noted that the elegant verse of his later volumes is distinguished rather by dexterous imitation of different writers than by any marked originality. The versatility and fecundity of Mend√®s' talent is shown in his critical and dramatic writings, including several libretti, and in his novels and short stories. His short stories continue the French tradition of the licentious conte. Personal life A portrait of Mend√®s' daughters, Huguette, Claudine, and Helyonne, by Auguste Renoir, 1888, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art In 1866, Mend√®s married Judith Gautier, the younger daughter of his mentor Th√©ophile. They soon separated, and in 1869 he began cohabiting with the composer Augusta Holm√®s with whom he had five children, including: * Huguette Mend√®s (1871‚Äì1964) * Claudine Mend√®s (1876‚Äì1937) * Helyonne Mend√®s (1879‚Äì1955) The couple parted in 1886, and he later married the poet Jeanne Nette, who was to be his last companion. =Death= Early on the morning of 8 February 1909, the body of Mend√®s was discovered in the railway tunnel of Saint Germain. He had left Paris by the midnight train on the 7th, and it is supposed that, thinking he had arrived at the station, he had opened the door of his compartment while still in the tunnel, although some biographers have suggested suicide. His body was interred at the Montparnasse Cemetery.

The son of Sydney McBryde and Jean Myrtle Esplin, he was educated in British Columbia public schools and at Central Washington State College. After graduating, he became a community development worker in northern Manitoba. In 1963, McBryde married Gladys Tenning. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1969, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent John Carroll by 196 votes in the northern riding of The Pas. The NDP formed a government after this election. McBryde initially served as a government backbencher, but entered cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio on December 1, 1971 when fellow northern MLA Joe Borowski was dropped from cabinet amid controversy. He left cabinet on April 13, 1972, but returned as Minister of Northern Affairs on November 1, 1972. McBryde was easily re-elected in the election of 1973 over independent candidate George Takashima, his sole opponent. He continued to serve as Northern Affairs minister until the Schreyer government was defeated in the election of 1977. McBryde retained his own seat in the 1977 election, and was a prominent supporter of Howard Pawley in his successful bid to replace Schreyer as party leader in 1979. McBryde did not seek re-election in 1981, in which the NDP under Pawley won a majority government. After the election, he was appointed as Deputy Minister to Northern Affairs minister Jay Cowan.

It is a step of the path that starts from the Lagrangian of some quantum field theory and leads to prediction of measurable quantities. It is named after the three German physicists Harry Lehmann, Kurt Symanzik and Wolfhart Zimmermann. Although the LSZ reduction formula cannot handle bound states, massless particles and topological solitons, it can be generalized to cover bound states, by use of composite fields which are often nonlocal. Furthermore, the method, or variants thereof, have turned out to be also fruitful in other fields of theoretical physics. For example in statistical physics they can be used to get a particularly general formulation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In and out fields S-matrix elements are amplitudes of transitions between in states and out states. An in state \\\\\\\\{p\\\\\\\\}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle describes the state of a system of particles which, in a far away past, before interacting, were moving freely with definite momenta and, conversely, an out state \\\\\\\\{p\\\\\\\\}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\rangle describes the state of a system of particles which, long after interaction, will be moving freely with definite momenta In and out states are states in Heisenberg picture so they should not be thought to describe particles at a definite time, but rather to describe the system of particles in its entire evolution, so that the S-matrix element: :S_{fi}=\\\\langle \\\\\\\\{q\\\\\\\\}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\\\\\{p\\\\\\\\}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle is the probability amplitude for a set of particles which were prepared with definite momenta to interact and be measured later as a new set of particles with momenta The easy way to build in and out states is to seek appropriate field operators that provide the right creation and annihilation operators. These fields are called respectively in and out fields. Just to fix ideas, suppose we deal with a Klein‚ÄìGordon field that interacts in some way which doesn't concern us: :\\\\mathcal L= \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\varphi\\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\varphi - \\\\frac 1 2 m_0^2 \\\\varphi^2 +\\\\mathcal L_{\\\\mathrm{int}} \\\\mathcal L_{\\\\mathrm{int}} may contain a self interaction or interaction with other fields, like a Yukawa interaction g\\\\ \\\\varphi\\\\bar\\\\psi\\\\psi. From this Lagrangian, using Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations, the equation of motion follows: :\\\\left(\\\\partial^2+m_0^2\\\\right)\\\\varphi(x)=j_0(x) where, if \\\\mathcal L_{\\\\mathrm{int}} does not contain derivative couplings: :j_0=\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal L_{\\\\mathrm{int}}}{\\\\partial \\\\varphi} We may expect the in field to resemble the asymptotic behaviour of the free field as , making the assumption that in the far away past interaction described by the current is negligible, as particles are far from each other. This hypothesis is named the adiabatic hypothesis. However self interaction never fades away and, besides many other effects, it causes a difference between the Lagrangian mass and the physical mass of the boson. This fact must be taken into account by rewriting the equation of motion as follows: :\\\\left(\\\\partial^2+m^2\\\\right)\\\\varphi(x)=j_0(x)+\\\\left(m^2-m_0^2\\\\right)\\\\varphi(x)=j(x) This equation can be solved formally using the retarded Green's function of the Klein‚ÄìGordon operator \\\\partial^2+m^2: :\\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{ret}}(x)=i\\\\theta\\\\left(x^0\\\\right)\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^3k}{(2\\\\pi)^3 2\\\\omega_k} \\\\left(e^{-ik\\\\cdot x}-e^{ik\\\\cdot x}\\\\right)_{k^0=\\\\omega_k}\\\\qquad \\\\omega_k=\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathbf{k}^2+m^2} allowing us to split interaction from asymptotic behaviour. The solution is: :\\\\varphi(x)=\\\\sqrt Z \\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x) +\\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4y \\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{ret}}(x-y)j(y) The factor is a normalization factor that will come handy later, the field is a solution of the homogeneous equation associated with the equation of motion: :\\\\left(\\\\partial^2+m^2\\\\right) \\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)=0, and hence is a free field which describes an incoming unperturbed wave, while the last term of the solution gives the perturbation of the wave due to interaction. The field is indeed the in field we were seeking, as it describes the asymptotic behaviour of the interacting field as , though this statement will be made more precise later. It is a free scalar field so it can be expanded in plane waves: :\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)=\\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3k \\\\left\\\\\\\\{f_k(x) a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf{k})+f^*_k(x) a^\\\\dagger_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf{k})\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where: :f_k(x)=\\\\left.\\\\frac{e^{-ik\\\\cdot x}}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}(2\\\\omega_k)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}}\\\\right_{k^0=\\\\omega_k} The inverse function for the coefficients in terms of the field can be easily obtained and put in the elegant form: :a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf{k})=i\\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x f^*_k(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0}\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x) where: :{\\\\mathrm{g}}\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0} f = \\\\mathrm{g}\\\\partial_0 f -f\\\\partial_0 \\\\mathrm{g}. The Fourier coefficients satisfy the algebra of creation and annihilation operators: :[a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf{p}),a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf{q})]=0;\\\\quad [a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf{p}),a^\\\\dagger_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf{q})]=\\\\delta^3(\\\\mathbf{p}-\\\\mathbf{q}); and they can be used to build in states in the usual way: :\\\\leftk_1,\\\\ldots,k_n\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\sqrt{2\\\\omega_{k_1}}a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}^\\\\dagger(\\\\mathbf{k}_1)\\\\ldots \\\\sqrt{2\\\\omega_{k_n}}a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}^\\\\dagger(\\\\mathbf{k}_n)0\\\\rangle The relation between the interacting field and the in field is not very simple to use, and the presence of the retarded Green's function tempts us to write something like: :\\\\varphi(x)\\\\sim\\\\sqrt Z\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)\\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{as}\\\\quad x^0\\\\to-\\\\infty implicitly making the assumption that all interactions become negligible when particles are far away from each other. Yet the current contains also self interactions like those producing the mass shift from to . These interactions do not fade away as particles drift apart, so much care must be used in establishing asymptotic relations between the interacting field and the in field. The correct prescription, as developed by Lehmann, Symanzik and Zimmermann, requires two normalizable states \\\\alpha\\\\rangle and \\\\beta\\\\rangle, and a normalizable solution of the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation (\\\\partial^2+m^2)f(x)=0. With these pieces one can state a correct and useful but very weak asymptotic relation: :\\\\lim_{x^0\\\\to-\\\\infty} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x \\\\langle\\\\alphaf(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0}\\\\varphi(x)\\\\beta\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt Z \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x \\\\langle\\\\alphaf(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0}\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)\\\\beta\\\\rangle The second member is indeed independent of time as can be shown by deriving and remembering that both and satisfy the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation. With appropriate changes the same steps can be followed to construct an out field that builds out states. In particular the definition of the out field is: :\\\\varphi(x)=\\\\sqrt Z \\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{out}}(x) +\\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4y \\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{adv}}(x-y)j(y) where is the advanced Green's function of the Klein‚ÄìGordon operator. The weak asymptotic relation between out field and interacting field is: : \\\\lim_{x^0\\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x \\\\langle\\\\alphaf(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0}\\\\varphi(x)\\\\beta\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt Z \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x \\\\langle\\\\alphaf(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0}\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{out}}(x)\\\\beta\\\\rangle The reduction formula for scalars The asymptotic relations are all that is needed to obtain the LSZ reduction formula. For future convenience we start with the matrix element: :\\\\mathcal M=\\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\alpha\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle which is slightly more general than an S-matrix element. Indeed, \\\\mathcal M is the expectation value of the time-ordered product of a number of fields \\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\cdots\\\\varphi(y_n) between an out state and an in state. The out state can contain anything from the vacuum to an undefined number of particles, whose momenta are summarized by the index . The in state contains at least a particle of momentum , and possibly many others, whose momenta are summarized by the index . If there are no fields in the time- ordered product, then \\\\mathcal M is obviously an S-matrix element. The particle with momentum can be 'extracted' from the in state by use of a creation operator: : \\\\mathcal M=\\\\sqrt{2\\\\omega_p}\\\\ \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\bigg \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}^\\\\dagger(\\\\mathbf p) \\\\bigg\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in} \\\\right \\\\rangle where the prime on \\\\alpha denotes that one particle has been taken out. With the assumption that no particle with momentum is present in the out state, that is, we are ignoring forward scattering, we can write: :\\\\mathcal M=\\\\sqrt{2\\\\omega_p}\\\\ \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\bigg \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}^\\\\dagger (\\\\mathbf p)- a_{\\\\mathrm{out}}^\\\\dagger(\\\\mathbf p) \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\bigg\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in} \\\\right \\\\rangle because a_{\\\\mathrm{out}}^\\\\dagger acting on the left gives zero. Expressing the construction operators in terms of in and out fields, we have: :\\\\mathcal M=-i\\\\sqrt{2\\\\omega_p}\\\\ \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x f_p(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0} \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\bigg \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] \\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)- \\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{out}}(x) \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\bigg\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\right \\\\rangle Now we can use the asymptotic condition to write: :\\\\mathcal M= -i\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\omega_p}{Z}} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\lim_{x^0\\\\to-\\\\infty} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x f_p(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0} \\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] \\\\varphi(x) \\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle-\\\\lim_{x^0\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x f_p(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0} \\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\varphi(x) \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] \\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\\\\\} Then we notice that the field can be brought inside the time-ordered product, since it appears on the right when and on the left when : :\\\\mathcal M=-i\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\omega_p}{Z}} \\\\left(\\\\lim_{x^0\\\\to-\\\\infty}-\\\\lim_{x^0\\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\right) \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x f_p(x) \\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0} \\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(x)\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] \\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in} \\\\rangle In the following, dependence in the time-ordered product is what matters, so we set: :\\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(x)\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] \\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle= \\\\eta(x) It's easy to show by explicitly carrying out the time integration that: : \\\\mathcal M=i\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\omega_p}{Z}} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}(x^0)\\\\partial_0 \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^3x f_p(x)\\\\overleftrightarrow{\\\\partial_0}\\\\eta(x) so that, by explicit time derivation, we have: :\\\\mathcal M=i\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\omega_p}{Z}} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4 x\\\\left\\\\\\\\{f_p(x)\\\\partial_0^2\\\\eta(x)-\\\\eta(x)\\\\partial_0^2 f_p(x)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} By its definition we see that is a solution of the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation, which can be written as: :\\\\partial_0^2f_p(x)=\\\\left(\\\\Delta-m^2\\\\right) f_p(x) Substituting into the expression for \\\\mathcal M and integrating by parts, we arrive at: :\\\\mathcal M=i\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2\\\\omega_p}{Z}} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4 x f_p(x)\\\\left(\\\\partial_0^2-\\\\Delta+m^2\\\\right)\\\\eta(x) That is: : \\\\mathcal M=\\\\frac{i}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}} Z^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4 x e^{-ip\\\\cdot x} \\\\left(\\\\Box+m^2\\\\right)\\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out} \\\\mathrm T\\\\left[\\\\varphi(x)\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)\\\\right] \\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle Starting from this result, and following the same path another particle can be extracted from the in state, leading to the insertion of another field in the time-ordered product. A very similar routine can extract particles from the out state, and the two can be iterated to get vacuum both on right and on left of the time-ordered product, leading to the general formula: :\\\\langle p_1,\\\\ldots,p_n\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}q_1,\\\\ldots,q_m\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle=\\\\int \\\\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{d}^4x_i \\\\frac{i e^{-iq_i\\\\cdot x_i} \\\\left(\\\\Box_{x_i}+m^2\\\\right)}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}} Z^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\prod_{j=1}^{n} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathrm{d}^4y_j \\\\frac{i e^{ip_j\\\\cdot y_j}\\\\left(\\\\Box_{y_j}+m^2\\\\right)}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}} Z^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\langle 0\\\\mathrm{T} \\\\varphi(x_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(x_m)\\\\varphi(y_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(y_n)0\\\\rangle Which is the LSZ reduction formula for Klein‚ÄìGordon scalars. It gains a much better looking aspect if it is written using the Fourier transform of the correlation function: : \\\\Gamma \\\\left (p_1,\\\\ldots,p_n \\\\right )=\\\\int \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{d}^4x_i e^{i p_i\\\\cdot x_i} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\langle 0\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\ \\\\varphi(x_1)\\\\ldots\\\\varphi(x_n)0\\\\rangle Using the inverse transform to substitute in the LSZ reduction formula, with some effort, the following result can be obtained: :\\\\langle p_1,\\\\ldots,p_n\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}q_1,\\\\ldots,q_m\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle= \\\\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{-\\\\frac{i\\\\left(p_i^2-m^2\\\\right)}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}} Z^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\prod_{j=1}^{n} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{i\\\\left(q_j^2-m^2\\\\right)}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}} Z^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\Gamma \\\\left (p_1,\\\\ldots,p_n;-q_1,\\\\ldots,-q_m \\\\right ) Leaving aside normalization factors, this formula asserts that S-matrix elements are the residues of the poles that arise in the Fourier transform of the correlation functions as four-momenta are put on-shell. Reduction formula for fermions Recall that solutions to the quantized free-field Dirac equation may be written as :\\\\Psi(x)=\\\\sum_{s=\\\\pm}\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tilde{p}\\\\big(b^s_\\\\textbf{p}u^s_\\\\textbf{p}\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip\\\\cdot x}+d^{\\\\dagger s}_\\\\textbf{p}v^s_\\\\textbf{p}\\\\mathrm{e}^{-ip\\\\cdot x}\\\\big), where the metric signature is mostly plus, b^s_\\\\textbf{p} is an annihilation operator for b-type particles of momentum \\\\textbf{p} and spin s=\\\\pm, d^{\\\\dagger s}_\\\\textbf{p} is a creation operator for d-type particles of spin s, and the spinors u^s_\\\\textbf{p} and v^s_\\\\textbf{p} satisfy (p\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/+m)u^s_\\\\textbf{p}=0 and (p\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/-m)v^s_\\\\textbf{p} = 0. The Lorentz-invariant measure is written as \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tilde{p}:=\\\\mathrm{d}^3 p/(2\\\\pi)^3 2\\\\omega_\\\\textbf{p}, with \\\\omega_\\\\textbf{p} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\textbf{p}^2+m^2}. Consider now a scattering event consisting of an in state \\\\alpha\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle of non-interacting particles approaching an interaction region at the origin, where scattering occurs, followed by an out state \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\rangle of outgoing non-interacting particles. The probability amplitude for this process is given by :\\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\alpha\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle, where no extra time-ordered product of field operators has been inserted, for simplicity. The situation considered will be the scattering of n b-type particles to n' b-type particles. Suppose that the in state consists of n particles with momenta \\\\\\\\{\\\\textbf{p}_1,...,\\\\textbf{p}_n\\\\\\\\} and spins \\\\\\\\{s_1,...,s_{n}\\\\\\\\}, while the out state contains particles of momenta \\\\\\\\{\\\\textbf{k}_1,...,\\\\textbf{k}_{n'}\\\\\\\\} and spins \\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma_1,...,\\\\sigma_{n'}\\\\\\\\}. The in and out states are then given by :\\\\alpha\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle = \\\\textbf{p}_1^{s_1},...,\\\\textbf{p}_n^{s_n}\\\\rangle\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\rangle = \\\\textbf{k}_1^{\\\\sigma_1},...,\\\\textbf{k}_{n'}^{\\\\sigma_{n'}}\\\\rangle. Extracting an in particle from \\\\alpha\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle yields a free-field creation operator b^{\\\\dagger s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1,\\\\mathrm{in}} acting on the state with one less particle. Assuming that no outgoing particle has that same momentum, we then can write :\\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}b^{\\\\dagger s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1,\\\\mathrm{in}}-b^{\\\\dagger s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1,\\\\mathrm{out}}\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle, where the prime on \\\\alpha denotes that one particle has been taken out. Now recall that in the free theory, the b-type particle operators can be written in terms of the field using the inverse relation :b^{\\\\dagger s}_\\\\textbf{p} = \\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^3 x\\\\;\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip\\\\cdot x}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x)\\\\gamma^0 u^s_\\\\textbf{p}, where \\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x)=\\\\Psi^\\\\dagger(x)\\\\beta. Denoting the asymptotic free fields by \\\\Psi_\\\\text{in} and \\\\Psi_\\\\text{out}, we find :\\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^3x_1\\\\;\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip_1\\\\cdot x_1}\\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_\\\\text{in}(x_1)\\\\gamma^0 u^{s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1}-\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_\\\\text{out}(x_1)\\\\gamma^0 u^{s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1}\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle. The weak asymptotic condition needed for a Dirac field, analogous to that for scalar fields, reads :\\\\lim_{x^0\\\\rightarrow-\\\\infty}\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^3 x\\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip\\\\cdot x}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x)\\\\gamma^0 u^{s}_{\\\\textbf{p}}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle=\\\\sqrt{Z}\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^3 x\\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip\\\\cdot x}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_\\\\text{in}(x)\\\\gamma^0 u^{s}_{\\\\textbf{p}}\\\\alpha\\\\rangle, and likewise for the out field. The scattering amplitude is then :\\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}\\\\Big(\\\\lim_{x_1^0\\\\rightarrow-\\\\infty}-\\\\lim_{x^0_1\\\\rightarrow+\\\\infty}\\\\Big)\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^3 x_1\\\\;\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip_1\\\\cdot x_1}\\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x_1)\\\\gamma^0 u^{s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1}\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle, where now the interacting field appears in the inner product. Rewriting the limits in terms of the integral of a time derivative, we have :\\\\mathcal{M} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^4 x_1\\\\partial_0\\\\big(\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip_1\\\\cdot x_1}\\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x_1)\\\\gamma^0 u^{s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1}\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle\\\\big) :: =-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^4 x_1(\\\\partial_0\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip_1\\\\cdot x_1}\\\\eta(x_1)+\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip_1\\\\cdot x_1}\\\\partial_0\\\\eta(x_1)\\\\big)\\\\gamma^0 u^{s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1}, where the row vector of matrix elements of the barred Dirac field is written as \\\\eta(x_1):=\\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}(x_1)\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle. Now, recall that \\\\mathrm{e}^{ip\\\\cdot x}u^s_\\\\textbf{p} is a solution to the Dirac equation: :(-i\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/+m)\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip\\\\cdot x}u^s_\\\\textbf{p}=0. Solving for \\\\gamma^0\\\\partial_0 \\\\mathrm{e}^{ip\\\\cdot x}u^s_\\\\textbf{p}, substituting it into the first term in the integral, and performing an integration by parts, yields :\\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^4x_1\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip_1\\\\cdot x_1}\\\\big(i\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\eta(x_1)\\\\gamma^\\\\mu + \\\\eta(x_1)m\\\\big)u^{s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1}. Switching to Dirac index notation (with sums over repeated indices) allows for a neater expression, in which the quantity in square brackets is to be regarded as a differential operator: :\\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^4x_1\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip_1\\\\cdot x_1}[(i{\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/}_{x_1} + m)u^{s_1}_{\\\\textbf{p}_1}]_{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1)\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle. Consider next the matrix element appearing in the integral. Extracting an out state creation operator and subtracting the corresponding in state operator, with the assumption that no incoming particle has the same momentum, we have :\\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1)\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\beta'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}b^{\\\\sigma_1}_{\\\\textbf{k}_1,\\\\mathrm{out}}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1) - \\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1)b^{\\\\sigma_1}_{\\\\textbf{k}_1,\\\\mathrm{in}}\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle. Remembering that (\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}\\\\gamma^0u^s_\\\\textbf{p})^\\\\dagger = \\\\bar{u}^s_\\\\textbf{p}\\\\gamma^0\\\\Psi, where \\\\bar{u}^s_\\\\textbf{p}:=u^{\\\\dagger s}_\\\\textbf{p}\\\\beta, we can replace the annihilation operators with in fields using the adjoint of the inverse relation. Applying the asymptotic relation, we find :\\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1)\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}\\\\Big(\\\\lim_{y^0_1\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}-\\\\lim_{y^0_1\\\\rightarrow-\\\\infty}\\\\Big)\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^3 y_1\\\\mathrm{e}^{-ik_1\\\\cdot y_1}[\\\\bar{u}^{\\\\sigma_1}_{\\\\textbf{k}_1}\\\\gamma^0]_{\\\\beta_1}\\\\langle\\\\beta'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\mathrm{T}[\\\\Psi_{\\\\beta_1}(y_1)\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1)]\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle. Note that a time-ordering symbol has appeared, since the first term requires \\\\Psi_{\\\\beta_1}(y_1) on the left, while the second term requires it on the right. Following the same steps as before, this expression reduces to :\\\\langle\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1)\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{i}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}^4y_1\\\\mathrm{e}^{-ik_1\\\\cdot y_1}[\\\\bar{u}^{\\\\sigma_1}_{\\\\textbf{k}_1}(-i\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/_{y_1}+m)]_{\\\\beta_1}\\\\langle\\\\beta'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\mathrm{T}[\\\\Psi_{\\\\beta_1}(y_1)\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1)]\\\\alpha'\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle. The rest of the in and out states can then be extracted and reduced in the same way, ultimately resulting in :\\\\langle \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\mathrm{out}\\\\alpha\\\\ \\\\mathrm{in}\\\\rangle=\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\mathrm{d}^4 x_j \\\\frac{i\\\\mathrm{e}^{ip_j x_j}}{\\\\sqrt{Z}} [(i{\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/}_{x_j}+m)u^{s_j}_{\\\\textbf{p}_j}]_{\\\\alpha_j}\\\\prod_{l=1}^{n'}\\\\mathrm{d}^4 y_l\\\\frac{i\\\\mathrm{e}^{-ik_l y_l}}{\\\\sqrt{Z}}[\\\\bar{u}^{\\\\sigma_l}_{\\\\textbf{k}_l}(-i{\\\\partial\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/}_{y_l}+m)]_{\\\\beta_l} \\\\langle 0 \\\\mathrm{T}[\\\\Psi_{\\\\beta_1}(y_1)...\\\\Psi_{\\\\beta_{n'}}(y_{n'})\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_1}(x_1)...\\\\bar{\\\\Psi}_{\\\\alpha_n}(x_n)]0\\\\rangle. The same procedure can be done for the scattering of d-type particles, for which u^s_\\\\textbf{p}'s are replaced by v^s_\\\\textbf{p}'s, and \\\\Psi's and \\\\bar{\\\\Psi}'s are swapped. Field strength normalization The reason of the normalization factor in the definition of in and out fields can be understood by taking that relation between the vacuum and a single particle state p\\\\rangle with four-moment on-shell: :\\\\langle 0\\\\varphi(x)p\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt Z \\\\langle 0\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)p\\\\rangle + \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4y \\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{ret}}(x-y) \\\\langle 0j(y)p\\\\rangle Remembering that both and are scalar fields with their lorentz transform according to: :\\\\varphi(x)=e^{iP\\\\cdot x}\\\\varphi(0)e^{-iP\\\\cdot x} where is the four-momentum operator, we can write: : e^{-ip\\\\cdot x}\\\\langle 0\\\\varphi(0)p\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt Z e^{-ip\\\\cdot x} \\\\langle 0\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(0)p\\\\rangle + \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4y \\\\Delta_{\\\\mathrm{ret}}(x-y)\\\\langle 0j(y)p\\\\rangle Applying the Klein‚ÄìGordon operator on both sides, remembering that the four-moment is on- shell and that is the Green's function of the operator, we obtain: : 0=0 + \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4y \\\\delta^4(x-y) \\\\langle 0j(y)p\\\\rangle; \\\\quad\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\quad \\\\langle 0j(x)p\\\\rangle=0 So we arrive to the relation: :\\\\langle 0\\\\varphi(x)p\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt Z \\\\langle 0\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)p\\\\rangle which accounts for the need of the factor . The in field is a free field, so it can only connect one-particle states with the vacuum. That is, its expectation value between the vacuum and a many- particle state is null. On the other hand, the interacting field can also connect many-particle states to the vacuum, thanks to interaction, so the expectation values on the two sides of the last equation are different, and need a normalization factor in between. The right hand side can be computed explicitly, by expanding the in field in creation and annihilation operators: :\\\\langle 0\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)p\\\\rangle= \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^3q}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}(2\\\\omega_q)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}} e^{-iq\\\\cdot x} \\\\langle 0a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf q)p\\\\rangle= \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^3q}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}} e^{-iq\\\\cdot x} \\\\langle 0a_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf q)a^\\\\dagger_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(\\\\mathbf p)0\\\\rangle Using the commutation relation between and a^\\\\dagger_{\\\\mathrm{in}} we obtain: : \\\\langle 0\\\\varphi_{\\\\mathrm{in}}(x)p\\\\rangle= \\\\frac{e^{-ip\\\\cdot x}}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}} leading to the relation: :\\\\langle 0\\\\varphi(0)p\\\\rangle= \\\\sqrt \\\\frac{Z}{(2\\\\pi)^3} by which the value of may be computed, provided that one knows how to compute \\\\langle 0\\\\varphi(0)p\\\\rangle.

Missouri was claimed by both the Union and the Confederacy, had two rival state governments, and sent representatives to both the United States Congress and the Confederate Congress. Despite sporadic threats from pro-Confederate irregular armies, the Union government had established permanent control of Missouri by the end of 1861, with the Confederate government functioning only as a government in exile for the duration of the war. Missouri Constitutional Convention At the beginning of the war, the governor of Missouri was Claiborne Fox Jackson, a Southern sympathizer who favored secession. At his inauguration, months before the war started, Jackson had requested the authorization of a state constitutional convention to consider the relationship between Missouri and the Federal government. A special referendum approved the Missouri Constitutional Convention and delegates were elected. Contrary to Jackson's expectations, no avowed secessionist delegates were elected. In February, Jackson unsuccessfully argued for Missouri's secession before the State Constitutional Convention convened to debate the issue under the leadership of former governor Sterling Price. Most of Missouri, like Price, held \\"conditional Unionist\\" beliefs at this point, meaning they neither favored secession nor supported the United States warring against the Confederacy. St. Louis Arsenal In early February, United States Army Captain Nathaniel Lyon, a vocal member of the Radical Republicans, was transferred to Missouri and stationed at the St. Louis Arsenal. The arsenal was under the command of Brevet Major Peter V. Hagner and supervised by Brigadier General William S. Harney, commander of the U.S. Army's Department of the West. Both men were considered moderates on the issues of slavery and sectional conflict by President James Buchanan's administration. Lyon by contrast had a reputation as an outspoken political radical and would soon validate that reputation in the eyes of the Missouri government. The St. Louis Arsenal, containing one of the largest caches of military supplies in the West, was sought by both the Union and Confederate armies. Several plots to obtain control of its arms were initiated in early 1861 by paramilitary organizations from both sides. The secessionist group was called the \\"St. Louis Minute Men\\". A Radical Republican paramilitary group from the 1860 campaign known as the Wide Awakes also made plans to take the arsenal. The Wide Awakes were organized under great secrecy by Congressman Frank Blair, an ally of Abraham Lincoln, with powerful connections to the incoming president through his brother Montgomery Blair. Lyon was also an old political ally of Blair and secretly supported the Wide Awakes plot to seize the arsenal. After Lincoln called for Union troops in preparation for the Civil War, Lyon recognized an opportunity to provide the Wide Awakes the arms they desired by mustering them into the Federal army. Up until that point, the Wide Awakes had limited arms, consisting only of what they successfully smuggled into Missouri from Illinois. As of March, however, Hagner still supervised the arsenal and Harney still commanded the Department of the West. Neither Hagner nor Harney were supportive of Lyon's plans with the Wide Awakes, and Hagner denied Lyon's attempts to release the arsenal's weapons to them. As soon as Lincoln was inaugurated, Lyon began exerting pressure on the president through the politically connected Blair to have himself named the new commander of the arsenal. After Hagner denied Lyon's request, the ambitious captain threatened to \\"pitch him in the river\\" and asked Blair to arrange for the major's replacement with himself. Blair promptly did so and, as an added assurance, secured orders for Harney to travel to Washington for consultations with the War Department. On April 21, 1861, with Lyon's control of the arsenal now unimpeded, he opened its gates to several Wide Awake \\"reinforcements\\" around midnight. This action set the stage for Lyon's arrest of a Missouri State Militia encampment near St. Louis on May 10 and the ensuing riot known as the Camp Jackson affair when the militiamen were paraded as prisoners toward the arsenal, much to the outrage of gathering civilian mobs. The deaths at St. Louis set off the first serious push for secession in Missouri and were harshly condemned by the state legislature and Price, the President of the now-adjourned State Convention. Both had previously resisted Jackson's call for secession and requests for more control over the state militia. After the massacre, though, the legislature authorized Jackson to reorganize the militia into the Missouri State Guard and appointed Price as its commander. Harney returned from Washington on May 12 and immediately attempted to alleviate the commotion caused by Lyon's actions two days earlier. On May 16, responding to requests from the mayor of St. Louis to have Lyon relieved of his post in Missouri, Attorney General Edward Bates presented two representatives of the city to President Lincoln. Frank Blair's brother and Postmaster General Montgomery Blair and War Secretary Simon Cameron intervened on Lyon's behalf, urging Lincoln to retain him. Lincoln sided with the Blairs and Cameron. A week later, Harney met with Price and drafted the Price-Harney Truce, which read: > General Price, having by commission full authority over the militia of the > State of Missouri, undertakes, with the sanction of the governor of the > State, already declared, to direct the whole power of the State officers to > maintain order within the State among the people thereof, and General Harney > publicly declares that, this object being thus assured, he can have no > occasion, as he has no wish, to make military movements, which might > otherwise create excitements and jealousies which he most earnestly desires > to avoid. The truce temporarily alleviated the mounting hostilities in Missouri but also left Lyon and Blair discontent. Blair, however, had obtained a trump card the previous month when Lincoln reluctantly authorized Blair to dismiss Harney from command at Blair's discretion. Blair did so on May 30 and orchestrated the promotion of Lyon to be Harney's successor. Facing reassignment, Harney pleaded with the Lincoln administration to continue cooperation in good faith with Price and protested the acts of unnamed persons‚Äîa likely reference to Blair and Lyon‚Äî\\"who clamored for blood have not ceased to impugn my motives.\\" Capture of Jefferson City After Harney's dismissal, agitations renewed between unionist and secessionist factions. Governor Jackson and now-General Lyon agreed to a last-ditch peace negotiation in St. Louis on June 11, 1861. Representing the state were Jackson, Price, and staffer Thomas Snead. Lyon was accompanied by Blair and his staff Maj. H. L. Conant. At the meeting Jackson and Price reasserted their position from the Price-Harney agreement and offered a position of Unionist neutrality in exchange for the withdrawal of Lyon's troops from the state, which contained the controversial Wide Awakes. After four hours of discussion, Lyon angrily rose and, pointing down Jackson, Price, and Snead, stated: > Rather than concede to the State of Missouri the right to demand that my > government shall not enlist troops within her limits, or bring troops into > the State whenever it pleases, or move troops at its own will into, out of, > or through the State; rather than concede to the State of Missouri for one > single instant the right to dictate to my government in any matter, however > unimportant, I would [pointing at the three state officials] see you, and > you, and you, and you and every man, woman and child in the State, dead and > buried. This means war. In an hour one of my officers will call for you and > conduct you out of my lines.\\" Jackson, Price, and their staff promptly returned to Jefferson City where the Governor issued a proclamation declaring that it was still the duty of all Missourians \\"to obey all the constitutional requirements of the Federal Government\\" but also that they were \\"under no obligation whatever to obey the unconstitutional edicts of the military despotism\\" and its \\"wicked minions\\", referring to Lyon, who he said should be driven from the state. However, the President had exercised his constitutional authority to declare an insurrection as a result of Fort Sumter, and he had called for state volunteers under existing Federal law. In the meantime, Lyon prepared for a rapid advance on Jefferson City. The State government and legislature, fearing for its safety, began an exodus to nearby Boonville, Missouri, which was deemed more defensible from a military perspective. Price, as commander of the state militia, followed from the rear, destroying bridges to slow Lyon's advance. Lyon captured the capital on June 15, but only two state officers, including the Attorney General, remained. Provisional Missouri Government organized On July 22, the executive committee of the Missouri State Convention reconvened and called for the convention to reassemble in Jefferson City. On July 30, the Missouri State Convention declared the existing state offices vacant. It then installed Hamilton R. Gamble as the military governor of Missouri and appointed the remaining state officers. It also declared all the seats of the legislature vacant and set a date for new elections.E.M. Violette (1918), A History of Missouri Knott, the elected Attorney General, was still in Jefferson City but soon found himself under arrest and then deposed for refusing to take an oath to the second state government. A series of skirmishes and battles between the Missouri State Guard and Union troops dominated the summer as Jackson's government fled to the southwest, culminating in the Battle of Wilson's Creek in August 1861 near Springfield. Neosho Legislature and Secession Ordinance View of Neosho's town square. The building directly opposite was the site of the provisional Confederate state capitol building. In the fall, Jackson's government set up a provisional capital and convened in the town of Neosho. On October 28, the legislature took up a bill for Missouri's secession from the Union, citing various \\"outrages\\" committed against the state and the overthrow of its government by Lyon. The bill was passed on October 30, and on October 31, it was signed by Governor Jackson, guaranteeing the secession of Missouri from the Union. The Neosho Secession Ordinance has long been a source of mystery for historians due to the unusual circumstances surrounding it. Ironically, the authority to secede had originally been given by the legislature to the state convention based upon the idea that a constitutional rewrite might be needed for an ordinance of secession to be passed. It is unclear whether the legislature had the authority to secede under state, if not Federal, law without the direction of the convention. At the same time, however, it is questionable as to whether the State Constitutional Convention had the legal power to expel both the entire executive and legislature from office and appoint new state officers, especially considering that at that specific point in time, no ordinance of secession had been passed, and it was legally nebulous whether any of the previous officers had committed treason or any other impeachable offense. Questions remain unresolved to this day as to whether Jackson's secessionist government or Gamble's provisional government was the legitimate government of Missouri. Jackson supporters claimed their status as the popularly elected government of Missouri to bolster their legitimacy, whereas Gamble had control of the old state capitol and had also been placed in office by a body elected by the state to determine the state's place in the Union. Perhaps the biggest mystery of Neosho is whether Jackson's legislature had a quorum to permit it to convene‚Äîa mystery that has prompted many historians to dismiss the Neosho government as a \\"rump legislature\\". The controversy exists for two reasons. First, surviving letters from earlier in the fall indicate that the vote was delayed until the end of October to obtain a quorum, which had been lacking. Second, the journals of the legislature which might have contained that information disappeared sometime during the war. The Senate journal was rediscovered in recent years among artifacts at the Wilson's Creek National Battlefield, and the House journal has only recently been found. =Evidence= In addition to the Senate journal, evidence of a House quorum has been speculated about on several grounds. Records of the secession bill itself show that Speaker of the House John McAfee presided over the session that adopted the bill. Clerk of the House Thomas H. Murry's signature also attests to the document's engrossment. The bill is also known to have been sponsored in the House by legislator George Graham Vest. Reports of a quorum and even vote totals for both bodies also appeared quickly in some newspapers. Their reliability, however, is unknown. The [Columbia] Missouri Statesman on November 15, 1861, claimed a quorum was reached by October 22. The Charleston Mercury of November 25, 1861, reported the session as follows: > The meeting of the Missouri State Legislature, which passed the ordinance of > secession at Neosho on the 2d inst. Was well attended‚Äîa full quorum being > present, including 23 members of the Upper and 77 of the Lower House; 19 of > the former and 68 of the latter constitute a quorum. The ordinance of > secession was passed unanimously, and without a dissenting voice. It was > dispatched to Richmond by a special messenger to the President, leaving > Memphis yesterday morning en route. One of the earliest historical accounts of Missouri's role in the Civil War written by former Confederate Col. John C. Moore, who also states that a quorum was present at the session: > In every particular it complied with the forms of law. It was called > together in extraordinary session by the proclamation of the governor. There > was a quorum of each house present. The governor sent to the two houses his > message recommending, among other things, the passage of an act \\"dissolving > all political connection between the State of Missouri and the United States > of America.\\" The ordinance was passed strictly in accordance with law and > parliamentary usage, was signed by the presiding officers of the two houses, > attested by John T. Crisp, secretary of the senate, and Thomas M. Murray, > clerk of the house, and approved by Claiborne F. Jackson, governor of the > State. The House Journal, recently discovered in the collections of the State Historical Society of Missouri, casts doubt on such assertions of quorum. Complete from the beginning of the session to end, the handwritten document never reports a roll call vote, so there is no authentication of the quorum. Newspaper accounts of the claims of the lone House member who the Journal reports as having voted no on both the articles of secession and affiliation with the Confederacy, Isaac N. Shambaugh of DeKalb County, further cloud the earlier claims of legitimacy. The [Columbia] Missouri Statesman of January 31, 1862, offered coverage of Shambaugh's speech to constituents in which he claimed that the legislative quorum was fraudulent, with at best only 39 House members and 10 members of the Senate present at either Neosho or Cassville, and that the names of affirmative voting members were deliberately excluded from both House and Senate journals. He corroborated the House Journal by claiming to have been the lone no votes on the two bills. During and after the war Acting on the ordinance passed by the Jackson government, the Confederate Congress admitted Missouri as the 12th confederate state on November 28, 1861. The Jackson government subsequently named Senators to the Confederate Congress. It was driven into exile from Missouri after Confederates lost control of the state and Jackson died a short while later in Arkansas. The secessionist government continued in exile, eventually setting up a legislature in Marshall, Texas until the end of the war. At the war's conclusion, the successors to the provisional (Union) government continued to govern the state of Missouri.

Source: Scurlock Studio, \\"President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"Black Cabinet\\" taken in March 1938\\" online at Smithsonian Institution The Black Cabinet, or Federal Council of Negro Affairs or Black Brain Trust, was the informal term for a group of African Americans who served as public policy advisors to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor Roosevelt in his terms in office from 1933 to 1945. Despite its name, it was not an official organization. The term was coined in 1936 by Mary McLeod Bethune and was occasionally used in the press. By mid-1935, there were 45 African Americans working in federal executive departments and New Deal agencies.New Deal (Roosevelt) History Although the council was concerned with civil rights, Franklin D. Roosevelt believed there were larger problems to be addressed than racial inequality during the wartime years; he was also struggling to maintain the support of the Southern white Congressional Democrats. Roosevelt declined to support legislation making lynching a federal offense, and banning the use of the poll tax in the South. The Black Cabinet, with Eleanor Roosevelt's support, worked to ensure that blacks received 10 percent of welfare funds. The Council argued that blacks were underrepresented among recipients of aid under the New Deal, in large part because Southern Democrats had influenced the structure and implementation of programs to aid their white constituents. For instance, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration helped farmers but did not help farmworkers; farm owners were given the incentive to cut farm production, reducing the need for labor. Programs such as the Works Projects Administration (WPA), and the National Youth Administration (NYA) attempted to direct 10 percent of funds to blacks (as their proportion of the US population). These agencies set up separate all-black units with the same pay and conditions as those in white units, to which black voters responded favorably. Mary McLeod Bethune served as an informal organizer of the council, as well as the Director of Negro Affairs in the National Youth Administration.Civil Rights Leader  NCNW  Mary McLeod Bethune Rayford Wittingham Logan drafted Roosevelt's executive order prohibiting the exclusion of blacks from the military in World War II. Other leaders included William H. Hastie, and Robert C. Weaver. The leaders associated with the Black Cabinet are often credited with laying part of the foundation of the Civil Rights Movement that developed in strength in the postwar years. The Council tried to create jobs for unemployed African Americans and to create more opportunities for them; still concentrated in rural areas of the South, blacks made up about twenty percent of the poor in the Depression Era. They were often the first to be let go from industrial jobs. Most of the black community did not benefit from some of the New Deal Acts. The WPA created agencies that employed creative people in a variety of jobs: as writers, artists, and other photographers. WPA murals were painted and WPA sculptures were commissioned for numerous federal buildings that were constructed during this period. Photographers documented families across the South and in northern cities. The Federal Writers' Project paid its workers $20 a week, and they wrote histories of every state in the Union, covering major cities in addition.About the WPA Life Histories Collection Under Roscoe E. Lewis, the Virginia Writers' Project sent out an all-black unit of writers to interview ex-slaves. Such accounts were also solicited in interviews in other states. The Slave Narrative Collection of the Federal Writers' Project stands as one of the most enduring and noteworthy achievements of the WPA. it is available online through the Library of Congress.Slave Narratives: An Introduction to the WPA Slave Narratives Members of the group worked officially and unofficially in their agencies to provide insight into the needs of African Americans. In the past, there had never been so many blacks chosen at one time to work together for the African-American community. The 45 primarily comprised an advisory group to the administration.Google Books Invisible Politics (page 263) The First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was said to encourage the formation of the Black Cabinet to help shape New Deal programs.\\"African American History\\" , Encyclopedia Encarta, accessed 31 October 2009 Members Most members were not politicians but community leaders, scholars, and activists, with strong ties to the African American community. Prominent members included Dr. Robert C. Weaver, a young economics expert from Harvard University and a race relations adviser. He worked with the White House to provide more opportunities for African Americans. In 1966 he became the first black cabinet member, appointed by Lyndon B. Johnson as Secretary of the newly created Department of Housing and Urban Development. During the 1970s, Weaver served as the national director of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was formed during New York City's financial crisis. Another prominent member of Roosevelt's Black Cabinet was Eugene K. Jones, the Executive Secretary of the National Urban League, a major civil rights organization. One of the most well-known members and only woman was Ms. Mary Jane McLeod Bethune. \\"Ms. Bethune was a Republican who changed her party allegiance because of Franklin Roosevelt.\\". Nancy Joan Weiss, Farewell to the Party of Lincoln: Black politics in the age of FDR, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1983, p. 142 Ms. Bethune was very closely tied to the community and believed she knew what the African Americans really wanted. She was looked upon very highly by other members of the cabinet, and the younger men called her \\"Ma Bethune.\\" Ms. Bethune was a personal friend of Mrs. Roosevelt and, uniquely among the cabinet, had access to the White House. Their friendship began during a luncheon when Mrs. Roosevelt sat Ms. Bethune to the right of the president, considered the seat of honor. Franklin Roosevelt was so impressed by one of Bethune's speeches that he appointed her to the Division of Negro Affairs in the newly created National Youth Administration.

According to the Blue Book: Manchester High School West Hand Book (1940), the school was officially opened in September 1923 as a grade school and high school, hosting the seventh and eighth grades. In 1924, with an upsurge in enrollment to 136 pupils, the school became a dedicated high school. The first graduating class was in June 1925. According to the 1940 Blue Book, the mission of the school was to give \\"each pupil an opportunity to find a career to which he is best adapted and to establish its basis by diligent study in order to promote his progress in life and to give him confidence in facing the world.\\" The courses of study originally offered by Manchester High School West were manual arts, home economics, the commercial course, the classical course (for those planning to go on to university) and the general course. Students living in Hooksett and Manchester attend West High School. West is one of three public high schools in Manchester. Well over 2,000 students attended West at its peak enrollment. In the past, Bedford, a suburb of Manchester, sent its high school-aged students to West. After a generation of debate and several votes, the town of Bedford eventually voted to build its own high school. The expanding class sizes at West and growing population of Bedford finally convinced Bedford voters of a need for a new high school. Bedford High School opened at the beginning of the 2007-2008 school year. With the opening of Bedford High School, Bedford students were phased out of West High School, reducing the enrollment at West to around 1,300 students. West High School's mascot is the Blue Knight.

It is the first book in his Honor Harrington series, and follows Commander Honor Harrington and Her Majesty‚Äôs light cruiser Fearless during their assignment to the Basilisk system. Though Basilisk Station and the planet of Medusa have become a dumping ground for military officers, currently in disfavor, from her home star system of Manticore. Honor is determined to discharge her duty regardless of the circumstances. The story follows Honor and her crew as they deal with the responsibilities of their assignment. When their duty leads them to discover events that would lead to an invasion of Medusa, they have no choice but to act.  Plot summary  = Prologue = Sidney Harris, the Hereditary President of the People's Republic of Haven, discusses the economic and military situation with his cabinet. Secretary of the Economy Walter Frankel presents the latest grim economic projections, blaming the naval budget. Admiral Amos Parnell retorts that the fleet is required to hold on to recently acquired star systems, and blames the bleak economic situation on the increases in the Basic Living Stipend instead. Frankel responds that the BLS increases are the only thing keeping the mob in check. Neither man is willing to budge, and both concede that additional income is required and, per the DuQuesne Plan the source of this income should be new conquests. Moving southwards towards Erewhon is rejected as too dangerous as the Solarian League could see it as a threat. Moving westwards towards the Silesian Confederacy is seen as the better option, but the Basilisk system is in the way, and the Basilisk system contains a terminus of the Manticore Wormhole Junction. The decision is made to take over the Basilisk system and Admiral Parnell is tasked with drawing up plans to that effect. = The story = Commander Honor Harrington, freshly graduated from the Royal Manticoran Navy's Advanced Tactical Course, assumes command of the light cruiser HMS Fearless, as it completes an extensive weapons refit, discovering, to her chagrin, that its normal complement of weapons has been stripped, replaced primarily by a \\"grav lance\\" commissioned by Admiral Sonja Hemphill. While Harrington uses it to perform spectacularly in the first round of a series of war games, her ship is summarily crushed in all following ones, and for the same simple reason: the grav lance is devastatingly effective at close range, but Fearless has neither the armor nor the other weaponry needed to close with an enemy ship. In order to cover up the embarrassing failure of her experiment, Admiral Hemphill (a cousin of Sir Edward Jan√°ƒçek, First Lord of the Admiralty), has Fearless reassigned to picket duty on Basilisk Station, a remote outpost of Manticore. At Medusa, Harrington finds Basilisk's picket fleet commanded by Captain Lord Pavel Young, a spoiled noble whose lackluster career is due in part to his attempt to rape Honor at the Academy several years earlier, and who has set up a ploy to ruin Honor's career. Taking his heavy cruiser Warlock off to Manticore for a \\"desperately needed\\" refit, Young leaves Honor and Fearless as the sole RMN unit responsible for the Basilisk system's security, a duty almost impossible to perform with a single ship. With hard work and clever use of resources, Honor soon has revitalized the RMN‚Äôs presence in Basilisk, capturing several prizes on charges of smuggling, and turning around the abysmal opinion of the fleet held by system personnel. During this, Honor learns of a long-standing drug ring catering to the Medusan aborigines, a three-legged sentient species at a Bronze Age technology level. The drug, mehoka, has a place in Medusan religion for its hallucinogenic properties, but can also be used to incite them to furious violence. Fearless's investigations reveal that humans have been synthesizing it on the planet for distribution to the nomadic members of the species. A raid on this drug lab also reveals the presence of further contamination: breech-loading flintlock rifles designed specifically for Medusan use, and crude enough for the Medusans to manufacture themselves. Whilst embroiled in this plot and trying to uncover who might be behind it, Honor Harrington becomes a figure of political note for the first time. In order to capitalize on Honor's accomplishments and discredit the conservatives in the government who are pushing for the Kingdom's withdrawal from Basilisk, a group of officers and politicians conspire to delay the completion of Warlocks refit and keep Young away from his post for as long as possible. Harrington and her crew get to the bottom of the sprawling plot: Haven, intent on conquering Medusa for their own, have arranged for a coup de main against Basilisk. By whipping some of the Medusan nomads into a killing frenzy that will sweep across the planet in a haze of blood, they can claim legal pretext to swoop in and take control of the system before Manticore can respond, as a preamble to invading Manticore itself The ground force of Medusans is easily dealt with by Fearlesss complement of Marines. However, the other half of the plan is the Sirius, a Havenite Q-ship disguised as a freighter with the task of signaling the Havenite fleet. Harrington cripples the one other Havenite ship in orbit (a diplomatic courier) and sends Fearless in pursuit of Sirius, notifying Manticore of the impending invasion. What follows is a grueling battle in which Fearless is crippled, but Sirius captain is sufficiently vexed by the damage inflicted by the small light cruiser that he turns Sirius about to ensure that she is destroyed. In doing so, he inadvertently brings Sirius within range of Fearless grav lance, and Sirius is destroyed. Manticore reinforces the system in time to greet the ‚Äúvisiting‚Äù Haven task force, who leave after a suitable interval to inform Haven of failure. After extensive repairs just to get her mauled ship underway, Honor returns to the Star Kingdom to a hero‚Äôs welcome. Promoted twice to Captain of the List, Honor is disappointed when the light cruiser is retired from service, but instead, she is given command of a newly constructed Star Knight-class heavy cruiser, re- christened as the new Fearless.  Players  The Star Kingdom of Manticore is gearing up for a likely war with Haven. However, some political factions do not believe that the war is inevitable and therefore hinder the Government's plans, including the necessary reinforcement of Basilisk. The Government, whose majority is slim, has little choice than to acquiesce and leave Basilisk almost undefended‚Äîuntil Honor Harrington is assigned there. The People's Republic of Haven finds that its economy is increasingly strained due to its welfare state and massive military budget, thus forcing their leaders to end their standoff with Manticore by any means necessary. Possession of Basilisk and its wormhole terminus would give Haven a strategic advantage over the Star Kingdom.  Characters  In addition to Honor Harrington, the story includes the first appearances of Alistair McKeon, Hamish Alexander, Lord Pavel Young, Andreas Venizelos, Rafael Cardones, Estelle Matsuko, Paul Tankersley, Mercedes Brigham, Prescott Tremaine, Klaus Hauptman, and Allen Summervale.

Dirk Willems (died 16 May 1569) (also spelled Durk Willems) was a Dutch martyred Anabaptist who is most famous for escaping from prison and turning back to rescue his pursuer‚Äîwho had fallen through thin ice while chasing Willems‚Äîto then be recaptured, tortured and killed for his faith. Life Willems was born in Asperen, Gelderland, Netherlands, and was baptized as a young man, thus rejecting the infant baptism practiced at that time by both Catholics and established Protestants in the Netherlands. This action, plus his continued devotion to his new faith and the baptism of several other people in his home, led to his condemnation by the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands and subsequent arrest. Willems was held in a residential palace turned into a prison, from which he escaped using a rope made out of knotted rags. Using this, he was able to climb out of the prison onto the frozen moat. A guard noticed his escape and gave chase. Willems was able to traverse the thin ice of a frozen pond, the Hondegat, because of his lighter weight after subsisting on prison rations. However, the pursuing guard broke through the ice and yelled for help as he struggled in the icy water. Willems turned back to save the life of his pursuer, thus being recaptured and held until he was burned at the stake near his hometown on 16 May 1569. Today, he is one of the most celebrated martyrs among Anabaptists, which includes Mennonites and Amish, as well as a folk hero among modern residents of Asperen. A historical drama based on his life‚ÄîDirk's Exodus‚Äîwas written in 1989 by James C. Juhnke. In 2018, a statue of Dirk Willems was unveiled at the Mennonite Heritage Village museum in Steinbach, Manitoba.

In 1988 he was beatified by Pope John Paul II.See the Vatican News Service, \\"Papal Office for Liturgical Celebrations\\" . He is the eponym of Fa√† di Bruno's formula. Life =Early life= Fa√† di Bruno was born in Alessandria, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, on 29 March 1825. He was of noble birth, being the twelfth and youngest child of the Marchese Luigi Fa√† di Bruno and the Lady Carolina Sappa de' Milanesi. He was raised in a home marked by happiness, the arts and a concern for the poor arising from the parents' strong Catholic faith.See . As a young man, he entered the Royal Army and held, at one time, the rank of Staff Officer. He resigned his commission, and went to Paris, where he did doctoral studies in mathematics under Augustin Cauchy, and Urbain Le Verrier, who both shared in the discovery of the planet Neptune.. He was in close contact with the mathematicians Fran√ßois-Napol√©on-Marie Moigno and Charles Hermite. On his return to Turin, he took up the position of Professor of Mathematics at the local university. In recognition of his achievements as a mathematician, the degree of Doctor of Science was conferred on him by the Universities of Paris and Turin. =Social reformer= While carrying out his career responsibilities, Fa√† di Bruno also became actively involved in the social outreach to the poor being developed by leading figures of the Catholic Church in Turin. He became a close friend of John Bosco,See and helped establish refuges for the elderly and the poor. He oversaw the construction of a church in Turin, Our Lady of Suffrage.Pope John Paul II, Message to the Institute of the Minim Sisters of Our Lady of Suffrage, September 2, 2002 =Priest and founder= Somewhat late in his life, Fa√† di Bruno came to feel that pursuing Holy Orders would help him in his religious activities, and commenced the necessary studies in theology. What he found, however, was that the Archbishop of Turin at that time would not accept an older man for ordination, Fa√† di Bruno being in his late 40s at that time. For centuries, the traditional route for this profession began in a boy's mid-teens. Fa√† di Bruno appealed to Pope Pius IX and received his support, finally being ordained at age 51. He founded the Minim Sisters of St. Zita in 1881 to provide help for maids and domestic servants, later expanding its outreach to include others, such as unmarried mothers. With their help, he also established another refuge, one dedicated to taking in prostitutes. Fa√† di Bruno died in Turin on 27 March 1888. =Veneration= The cause for the canonization of Fa√† di Bruno opened in the early 20th century by the Archdiocese of Turin and he was declared a Servant of God. He was declared Venerable by Pope Paul VI in 1971, and beatified by Pope John Paul II on the centennial of his death in 1988. In an address to the Minim Sisters in 2002, Pope John Paul II said, \\"\\"Francesco Fa√† di Bruno\\", I said, is \\"a giant of faith and charity\\", for his message of light and love, \\"far from being exhausted, seems timelier than ever, urging all those who have Gospel values at heart to action\\"\\" (Homily, 25 September, n. 4; ORE, 24 October 1988, p. 15). Research in mathematics In addition to some ascetical writings, the composition of some sacred melodies, and the invention of some scientific apparatus, Fa√† di Bruno made numerous and important contributions to mathematics. Today, he is best known for Fa√† di Bruno's formula on derivatives of composite functions although it is now certain Louis Fran√ßois Antoine Arbogast had priority for its discovery and use. Fa√† di Bruno should be credited only for the formula's determinant form.See the paper of : this well written and informative paper details also the works of other earlier scientists. However, his work is mainly related to elimination theory and to the theory of elliptic functions.See and various papers in the volume edited by : particularly the later reference states that he introduced the Fa√† di Bruno's formula to deal with problems in elimination theory.

It is located on the south side of Lawrence Avenue West, just east of Weston Road, in the neighbourhood of Weston. Overview Weston station consists of three tracks served by one side and one island platform, and a fourth track and side platform are planned on the east side of station. Each platform has two sections: UP Express trains stop at high-level platforms at the north end of the station, while Kitchener Line trains stop at low-level platforms at the south end of the station. In addition to the Metrolinx-owned passenger rail tracks, the double-tracked Canadian Pacific MacTier Subdivision passes along the east side of the station. The station is fully accessible, with pedestrian entrances from Weston Road and Lawrence Avenue and a pedestrian bridge across Lawrence Avenue. The station parking lot has a capacity of 144 cars and it includes a kiss and ride passenger drop off area. A new pedestrian bridge opened in late October 2016 providing a means to cross Lawrence Avenue without having to walk over to either Weston Road or Ralph Street. History =Early stations= The first stations at this location were the Weston Stations of the Canadian National Railway (CNR) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). GTR Weston / CNR Weston The CNR station was built in 1856 by the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) south of John Street which was absorbed by the CNR in 1923. CPR Weston The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway (TG&BR;) went into service in 1871 on narrow gauge rail, which had been converted to standard gauge track by 1883, and became part of the CPR in 1884. The CPR station was located on northside of John Street west of Rosemount Avenue and demolished in the late 1970shttp://canada- rail.com/ontario/t/toronto4.html#.XH4X0PZFzmI after failed attempt to convert it to a farmers' market. Legacy A Tim Hortons store on the south side of Lawrence Avenue West, east of the tracks, pays homage to the old stations with a replica \\"Weston\\" station sign on the roof. =First GO Station= The first Weston GO Station opened in 1974 and stretched north from Lawrence Avenue to John Street. It consisted of a single track and platform accessed via a staircase and entrance from Lawrence Avenue west of the railway overpass. The station was demolished in 2013 following the opening of the new GO station. =Current GO Station= A new Weston GO station was opened on July 23, 2013 on the south side of Lawrence Avenue. The station was built as a part of the Georgetown South railway improvement project, which included eliminating all level crossings of the Kitchener Line in the City of Toronto. The original GO station on the north side of Lawrence Avenue was demolished in order to construct a ramp into the new tunnel under the Weston area. The new station features many improvements over the previous station, such as more parking, more platforms, more tracks, heated shelters, enclosed entrances, space for future retail and a new pedestrian bridge over Lawrence Avenue. The initial plan for the airport rail link service to Pearson International Airport, Blue22, did not include a stop at Weston station. However, in 2005, area residents campaigned for a stop on the service in 2005 as compensation for negative impacts of the railway expansion. Following the takeover of the project by Metrolinx, Weston became a stop on the planned service.\\"Airport link plan tackles fears in Weston area, premier says\\" By Tess Kalinowski & Rob Benzie, Toronto Star. January 22, 2009 As a result, Weston has been a stop on the Union Pearson Express since the service began operation in June 2015. UPX president Kathy Haley said that 10 per cent of UPX riders are expected to board at Weston GO Station. Connections There are no bus stops beside the station, but a short distance west at the intersection of Lawrence Avenue West and Weston Road, connections can be made to Toronto Transit Commission bus routes 52 Lawrence West, 79 Scarlett Road, 89 Weston, 952 Lawrence West Express and 989 Weston Express.

Most of its route was formerly the A1 being the original route of the Great North Road until the A1 was re-routed with the opening of the A1(M) in the 1960s. Route The route starts from the A168 at Topcliffe, North Yorkshire and runs to Cowgate, Tyne and Wear where the route splits in two. The northern fork continues to Kenton Bar, where it meets the A1 and the A696, while the southern fork heads west, again terminating at the A1, this time at Westerhope. From the Topcliffe A168 Junction, the route runs north through Northallerton, and crosses the A66 road just east of the A66(M) section. It runs on through Darlington, across A1(M) junction 59, and on to Newton Aycliffe, Ferryhill, Durham and Chester-le- Street. A167 North of Durham exiting Pity Me Roundabout Northbound The A167 bypass at Chilton near Ferryhill was completed and opened to traffic on 20 June 2005. Construction had started in 2004, 65 years after first proposed when the route was still the A1. Beyond Chester-le-Street the A167 continues to A1(M) junction 63 and through Birtley before crossing the A1 at the junction near the Angel of the North. (The first route of the Great North Road ran via Wrekenton on the present B1296. The second route ran via Low Fell on the A167. The third route ran from the A1(M) junction 65 via the A194(M) and the A19 Tyne Tunnel, to the Wideopen A1/A19 Junction.) The start point of the Great North Run is on the A167(M) Central Motorway in Newcastle. A167(M) Sliproads to/from A167(M) at Swan House junction The A167 continues through Gateshead across the Tyne Bridge into Newcastle upon Tyne, where it becomes the A167(M) Newcastle Central Motorway for a short distance. After the city centre it reverts to dual carriageway to its terminus at the Kenton Bar A1/A696 junction. Originally the road was the A1(M), but changes to the route of the A1 have caused changes to the route number.Pathetic Motorways: A1(M) Central Motorway East When the A1 was re-routed through the Tyne Tunnel, it was renumbered as the A6127(M)Pathetic Motorways: A6127(M) ‚Äì becoming one of only two four-digit, Axxxx(M) motorways, the other being the A6144(M) motorway. After the construction of the A1 western bypass, the Tyne Tunnel became the A19 and the A6127(M) became the A167(M). The A167(M) is unusual in that it has a slip road leading from an unclassified road directly onto the right-hand (\\"fast\\") lane at Camden Street; a result of its two-tier construction. However, as of late 2011 this slip road is closed. It also has other junctions where entry to and exit from the motorway is via the outside lane, which can lead to a lot of weaving and conflicting traffic movement.

It is a popular folk-dance in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. It is a slow round dance continuously moving in a circular manner, and incorporates graceful hand movements and simple footwork. Both men and women participate in the same circle. The circular dance style is claimed as a traditional dance in the three countries of the region where it is often part of traditional festivities, popular celebrations and modern parties. In addition to the dominate Khmer, Lao and Thai cultures, romvong is also common among many other groups indigenous to Southeast Asia. In Cambodia, for example, Ramvong dance is also found among ethnic groups including the Phnong, Krung, Tampuan and Brao people. Etymology Romvong, sometimes transliterated as ramvong, is from the Khmer word (). In Khmer, the word consists of two separate native Khmer morphemes (rom: \\"dance\\") and (vong: \\"circle\\").Chuon Nath Khmer Dictionary. 1966, Buddhist Institute, Phnom PenhWilaiwan Khanittanan. Khmero- Thai-the great change in the history of the Thai language. Thammasat University. http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/khmero-thai_- _the_great_change_in_the_history_of_the_thai_language.pdf The words were borrowed into both Thai (, ram; , wong) and Lao (, lam; , wong) with the same meanings and pronounced according to phonology of the respective languages. History Romvong is very popular among otherMon-Khmer indigenous people known as Khmer Ler, which has nothing to do with those tribes mentioned after, such as Kroeng, Phnong, Tampuan, etc. All ethnic Khmers including Northern Khmer (Thailand), Khmer Kandal (Cambodia), and Khmer Krom (Southern Vietnam) as well as other Mon-Khmer tribes used the same word \\"roamvong\\" for this type of dance as a unified Khmer identity. The indigenous Mon-Khmer minority known as Khmer Ler, who are called those khmer living in higher latitude land only, inhabited Northeastern Cambodia and other mountainous region in mainland Southeast Asia popularly dance circling the campfire at night. This dancing (romvong) dates for millenniums. In the Leang Arak rituals or Lerng Nak Ta which was the original Khmer tradition before Hinduism and Buddhism introduced to ancient Cambodia, small shrine was built surrounded with religious fence, where the spiritual women dance around the shrine. On the other hand, the Buffalo Slaughtering for Spirit of Mon-Khmer tribes where people dance around in circle also carved on the wall of Bayon temple for millennium, which is completely nonsense to connect this to Ramvong . There is not even a clue which can proof that Cambodian had this dance before 1900s. Then romvong become more popular for the locals dancing for entertainment and celebrations. Romvong was probably performed by the Khmer locals during New Year celebration and festivities during Khmer Empire, and later on adopted by other Tai settlers, the ancestor of modern Thais and Laos when settling in Khmer Empire territories, based on the writer's opinion. Description The basic pattern involves two couples folding their palms, with their fingers at right angles to their wrists, and bringing the hands up from behind the body to in front of the face, straightening and bending the fingers in time to the music throughout. The hands move in opposition directions, one to the left and one to the right. The legs must move in time of the rhythm, and in the opposite direction of the partner. Dancers continue around in a circle, keeping in time with the beat of the drum. There is often a decorated pole or a vase of flowers used to mark the center of the circle. Importance in Cambodia As Romvong originated from Khmer pre-historical tradition, this type of folk dance is very popular in Cambodia as this type of slow dance is regarded as Khmer national identity and local folklore. Romvong is the most popular folk dance perform by both men and women across Cambodia especially in the New Year Eve, national and religious celebrations, and occasional events. Khmer people performs romvong for entertainment, releasing stress, and happiness. This type of dance is easily learned and perform, that's why most Khmer people regardless of social status know how to perform it. Moreover, Romvong songs are very popular among Khmer people sing during Khmer New Year (Sankrata), and other festivities especially during local celebrations. Importance in Thailand Thon was a drum used to mark the rhythm in ramthon, the dance that gave origin to ramvong. In Thailand ramvong is deemed to have originated in ramthon (), an older kind of folk dance where the rhythm was marked by a kind of drum known as thon (). The Fine Arts Department of Thailand has identified over ten different styles of ramvong.Ramwong - Thai music inventory Ramvong was patronized by Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram during the hard times of Thailand in World War II. In order to help people to forget their penury, the military dictator encouraged Thai women and men to enjoy themselves by dancing ramvong. Also, as part of the policy of Thaification during his tenure, Phibunsongkhram aimed to stem the popularity of non-Thai dances such as the foxtrot or waltz through the promotion of ramvong. Even government officials were given half a day during the work week to dance ramvong together at their offices. After the end of World War II ramvong was largely replaced by luk thung and cha-cha-cha although its influence survived in Thai society.Nation-building and the Pursuit of Nationalism under Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram See also *Khmer classical dance *Dance of Cambodia *Culture of Cambodia *Dance in Thailand References External links *Leisure Cambodia: Popular Khmer Dances *Photo of ramvong circle (Laos) *CulturalProfiles.net: \\"Fon phun muang - Lao folk dance\\". *Thai Women: Changing Status and Roles Asian dances Cambodian culture Partner dance Cambodian music Laotian culture Thai dance Thai culture ","title":"Romvong"},{"id":"1372704","text":"Gord Martineau (born September 23, 1947) is a Canadian television journalist.

Crazy quilting does not actually refer to a specific kind of quilting (the needlework which binds two or more layers of fabric together), but a specific kind of patchwork lacking repeating motifs and with the seams and patches heavily embellished. A crazy quilt rarely has the internal layer of batting that is part of what defines quilting as a textile technique. Rebecca Palmer. Crazy Quilt, 1884. Silk, velvet. Brooklyn Museum Tamar Horton Harris North. ‚ÄúQuilt (or decorative throw), Crazy pattern‚Äù. ~1877. 54 ¬Ω √ó 55 in. Metropolitan Museum of Art. Embellishing Crazy quilts differ from \\"regular\\" quilts in other ways as well. Because the careful geometric design of a quilt block is much less important in crazy quilts, the quilters are able to employ much smaller and more irregularly shaped pieces of fabric. In comparison to standard quilts, crazy quilts are far more likely to use exotic pieces of fabric, such as velvet, satin, tulle, or silk, and embellishments such as buttons, lace, ribbons, beads, or embroidery. Crazy quilting as a textile art is extremely creative and free-flowing by nature, and crazy quilters will often learn as much about specific embellishments as they will about crazy quilting itself. Crazy quilts range from carefree and relatively easy, to extremely labor- intensive. A Harper's Bazaar article from 1884 estimated that a full-size crazy quilt could take 1,500 hours to complete. History Crazy quilts became popular in the late 1800s, likely due to the English embroidery and Japanese art that was displayed at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. American audiences were drawn to the satin stitches used in English embroidery, which created a painterly surface, which is reflected in many Crazy Quilts. The displays shown at the Japanese pavilion of silk-screened work and Japanese pottery with a cracked-glaze inspired the American audiences. Similar aesthetics began to show up in Crazy Quilts, including unique patterns, and stitching that resembled spider webs and fans.Workt By Hand Hidden Labor and Historical Quilts . Edited by Katherine Morris. Brooklyn Museum. 2012. Crazy quilting rapidly became a national fashion amongst urban, upper-class women, who used the wide variety of fabrics that the newly industrialized 19th century textile industry offered to piece together single quilts from hundreds of different fabrics. Long after the style had fallen out of fashion amongst urban women, it continued in rural areas and small towns, whose quilters adopted the patterns of the urban quilts but employed sturdier, more practical fabrics, and dropped the earlier quilts' ornate embroidery and embellishment.

There are several types of models, each extending the Standard Model. The simplest version, \\"Type 1\\", extends the Standard Model by assuming two or more additional right-handed neutrino fields inert under the electroweak interaction, and the existence of a very large mass scale. This allows the mass scale to be identifiable with the postulated scale of grand unification.  Type 1 seesaw  This model produces a light neutrino, for each of the three known neutrino flavors, and a corresponding very heavy neutrino for each flavor, which has yet to be observed. The simple mathematical principle behind the seesaw mechanism is the following property of any 2√ó2 matrix of the form :A = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0&M;\\\\\\\\\\\\M&B;\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\text{.} It has two eigenvalues: :\\\\lambda_\\\\pm = \\\\frac{B\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{B^2+4M^2}}{2} \\\\text{.} The geometric mean of + and equals , since the determinant . Thus, if one of the eigenvalues goes up, the other goes down, and vice versa. This is the point of the name \\"seesaw\\" of the mechanism. In applying this model to neutrinos, is taken to be much larger than . Then the larger eigenvalue, +, is approximately equal to , while the smaller eigenvalue is approximately equal to :\\\\lambda_- \\\\approx -\\\\frac{M^2}B. This mechanism serves to explain why the neutrino masses are so small. The matrix is essentially the mass matrix for the neutrinos. The Majorana mass component is comparable to the GUT scale and violates lepton number; while the components Dirac mass , are of order of the much smaller electroweak scale ‚Äì called the \\"VEV\\" below. The smaller eigenvalue ‚àí then leads to a very small neutrino mass, comparable to , which is in qualitative accord with experiments ‚Äì sometimes regarded as supportive evidence for the framework of Grand Unified Theories.  Background  The 2√ó2 matrix arises in a natural manner within the standard model by considering the most general mass matrix allowed by gauge invariance of the standard model action, and the corresponding charges of the lepton- and neutrino fields. Let the Weyl spinor be the neutrino part of a left-handed lepton isospin doublet (the other part being the left-handed charged lepton), : L=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\chi \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\eta \\\\end{pmatrix} ~, as it is present in the minimal standard model without neutrino masses, and let be a postulated right-handed neutrino Weyl spinor which is a singlet under weak isospin (i.e. does not interact weakly, such as a sterile neutrino). There are now three ways to form Lorentz covariant mass terms, giving either :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\, B'\\\\,\\\\chi^\\\\alpha \\\\chi_\\\\alpha \\\\, \\\\text{,}\\\\quad \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,B\\\\,\\\\eta^\\\\alpha\\\\eta_\\\\alpha \\\\,\\\\text{,}\\\\quad\\\\text{or} \\\\quad M\\\\,\\\\eta^\\\\alpha \\\\chi_\\\\alpha \\\\,\\\\text{,} and their complex conjugates, which can be written as a quadratic form, :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\chi& \\\\eta\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}B' & M \\\\\\\\\\\\ M& B\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\chi\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\eta\\\\end{pmatrix}. Since the right- handed neutrino spinor is uncharged under all standard model gauge symmetries, is a free parameter which can in principle take any arbitrary value. The parameter is forbidden by electroweak gauge symmetry, and can only appear after its spontaneous breakdown through a Higgs mechanism, like the Dirac masses of the charged leptons. In particular, since has weak isospin ¬Ω like the Higgs field , and has weak isospin 0, the mass parameter can be generated from Yukawa interactions with the Higgs field, in the conventional standard model fashion, :\\\\mathcal{L}_{yuk}=y \\\\, \\\\eta L \\\\epsilon H^* +~... This means that is naturally of the order of the vacuum expectation value of the standard model Higgs field, :\\\\text{VEV }v\\\\approx 246 \\\\text{ GeV}, \\\\qquad\\\\qquad \\\\langle H \\\\rangle= v/\\\\sqrt{2} :M_t= O( v/\\\\sqrt{2})\\\\approx 174 \\\\text{ GeV}~, if the dimensionless Yukawa coupling is of order It can be chosen smaller consistently, but extreme values can make the model nonperturbative. The parameter , on the other hand, is forbidden, since no renormalizable singlet under weak hypercharge and isospin can be formed using these doublet components - only a nonrenormalizable, dimension 5 term is allowed. This is the origin of the pattern and hierarchy of scales of the mass matrix within the \\"Type 1\\" seesaw mechanism. The large size of can be motivated in the context of grand unification. In such models, enlarged gauge symmetries may be present, which initially force in the unbroken phase, but generate a large, non-vanishing value ‚âà 1015 GeV, around the scale of their spontaneous symmetry breaking. So given a mass one has A huge scale has thus induced a dramatically small neutrino mass for the eigenvector .

Due to the war consuming the majority of skilled officers and ratings, Honor is forced to take along a large portion of problem personnel and fresh out ratings on their first cruise. Wayfarer includes space for carrying a squadron of Light Attack Craft (LACs), a large number of missile pods that can be quickly deployed through the ship's rear cargo doors, and unusually heavy energy weaponry for the ship's intended role, but it is essentially still a merchant ship: unarmored, much slower than a regular navy vessel, and with lighter defenses. Honor's orders are to lead a squadron of four Q-ships to fight piracy in the Silesian Confederacy. Although piracy is a chronic problem in Silesia, the Royal Navy managed to keep it somewhat in check until the war began; with the fleet needed elsewhere piracy has gone completely out of control and the powerful Manticoran merchant cartels demand that the Navy do something. There are other considerations: Silesia is something of a disputed territory between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Andermani Empire. While Honor leads her crew in battles against various pirates, the Havenites are also conducting covert commerce raiding in Silesia, in an attempt to destabilize Manticoran trade in the region and present themselves in a more favorable light to the Andermani. The Havenite light cruiser PNS Vaubon, under Citizen Commander Warner Caslet, had been pursuing a particularly loathsome group of raiders whose actions were repugnant to most of the Havenite officers involved. When Caslet sees some of these raiders attacking what he thinks is a Manticore merchant ship he decides to attack the raiders, despite being outnumbered. The Wayfarer destroys the raiders and Caslet is forced to surrender Vaubon to the superior vessel. With the additional intelligence gathered by the Havenites, Honor takes the fight to the pirates led by the terrorist Andre Warnecke and with a hostage gambit liberates the planet Sidemore, which had been occupied by the pirates. A side plot during this is that of Aubrey Wanderman, a rating on his first cruise, who is brutally attacked by another rating, Randy Steilman. Terrified of Steilman's apparent untouchability, Wanderman refuses to report Steilman, and is taken under the wing of Horace Harkness, who trains Wanderman in the coup de vitesse, a form of martial arts. Later, after Steilman attempts to engineer the death of Ginger Lewis, Wanderman beats Steilman into a bloody mess, and Steilman's plot to desert is uncovered. After her defeat of the pirates Honor goes looking for the Havenite commerce raiders. This leads to a larger-scale conflict with Havenite forces. Klaus Hauptman has traveled on the liner Artemis to see the piracy situation first hand in Silesia, and Honor encounters them just as the Havenites are closing in on the Artemis. In the ensuing battle Wayfarer is able to destroy two Havenite battlecruisers but is itself ultimately destroyed. The few surviving members of Honor's crew, along with several Havenite prisoners, are rescued and return to Andermani space. Because of Honor's bravery in saving Hauptman's life during the battle the two are reconciled.  Background  Honor Among Enemies also depicts life in the lower ranks of the Royal Manticoran Navy, following young crewman Aubrey Wanderman through his adaptation to life onboard Wayfarer and his troubles with and eventual victory over a band of thug-like crewmen. The novel also plays up Honor Harrington's similarities with Horatio Hornblower, as one chapter shows Captain Harrington reading one of C.S. Forester's \\"darned good\\" Hornblower novels. Like previous books in the series, a good portion of the novel is told from the perspective of People's Navy officers, including the aforementioned Warner Caslet and his tactical officer Shannon Foraker, introduced in the preceding Flag in Exile. Their motivations and characters are more fully explored and shown to be in many ways the moral equal of the Manticorans, including Caslet's determination to pursue raiders whose actions have gone beyond the pale, far outside acceptable practice under the laws of war. It also introduced Admiral Javier Giscard, commander of the Havenite raiders, and his political watchdog (and lover) Eloise Pritchart.

The Momella route ‚Äì which starts at Momella gate, on the eastern side of the mountain ‚Äì is used to climb Mount Meru. Much of its bulk was lost about 7,800 years ago due to a summit collapse. Mount Meru most recently had a minor eruption in 1910. The several small cones and craters seen in the vicinity probably reflect numerous episodes of volcanic activity. Mount Meru's caldera is wide. Mount Meru is the topographic centerpiece of Arusha National Park. Its fertile slopes rise above the surrounding savanna and support a forest that hosts diverse wildlife, including nearly 400 species of birds, and also monkeys and leopards.

Instituto Butantan is a public institution affiliated with the S√£o Paulo State Secretariat of Health and considered one of the major scientific centers in the world. Butantan is the largest immunobiologicals and biopharmaceuticals producer in Latin America (and one of the largest in the world). It is world-renowned for its collection of venomous snakes, as well as those of venomous lizards, spiders, insects and scorpions. By extracting the reptiles' and insects' venoms, the Institute develops antivenoms and medicines against many diseases, which include tuberculosis, rabies, tetanus and diphtheria.  History  The Institute was founded by the Brazilian physician and biomedical scientist Vital Brazil in 1901, according to Pasteur Institute paradigm, i.e., by combining in the same institution medical research, the transfer of the results to society as health products, and self-financing through this later activity. Its foundation was a reaction to the outbreak of bubonic plague in the city of Santos. It is internationally renowned for its research on venomous animals; it was visited by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. It is also a state-supported producer of vaccines against many infectious diseases, such as rabies, hepatitis, botulism, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and tuberculosis, as well as polyvalent and monovalent antivenoms against the bites of snakes, lizards, bees, scorpions and spiders (which, historically were first developed in the beginning of the 20th century by Dr. Vital Brazil and his coworkers). Among the distinguished scientists at the institute were biochemists Karl Slotta and Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat, pioneers in the study of progesterone, estriol, and medical use of venom, from 1935 to 1948. A fire in 2010 destroyed the collection facility, which maintained one of the largest collections of venomous animals in the world, comprising around 80,000 snake specimens, and an estimated 450,000 spiders and scorpions. The name of the institute comes from \\"Butant√£\\", a district in the west zone of S√£o Paulo. \\"Butant√£\\" itself is a Tupi word meaning \\"crushed soil\\".  Education and research  The Institute develops basic and applied biomedical research in many areas, including molecular biology, immunology and epidemiology and has a graduate research training program in collaboration with other institutions, in the areas of biotechnology and infectology. Besides its research laboratories, production units and specialized library, it operates an animal breeding center for providing subjects for research and production of sera. The Instituto Butantan also operate the \\"Hospital Vital Brazil\\", a specialist hospital that offers free treatment for poisonous animal stings and bites. The institute also accepts donations of serpents, arthropods and other animals captured by the public and by a network of collaborating centers and individuals. The following research laboratories are part of the Butantan Institute: * Arthropods * Herpetology * Cellular biology * Immunogenetics * Immunopathology * Viral Immunology * Immunochemistry * Genetics * Dermatology * Pathophysiology * Biochemistry and Biophysics * Pharmacology * Microbiology * Parasitology * Biopharmaceuticals * Applied Toxinology * Biotechnology Center Important Brazilian scientists who have worked in the Butantan Institute are: Vital Brazil, Afr√¢nio Pomp√≠lio Gastos do Amaral, Isaias Raw, Samuel Pessoa, Willy Be√ßak. The Institute has strong collaborative ties with the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France, and with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro.  Production  The Butantan Institute is the largest producer in Latin America (and one of the largest in the world) of immunobiologicals and biopharmaceuticals. In 2001 it produced ca. doses of vaccines and vials of hyperimmune sera. The institute is responsible for the production of 90% of the vaccines used in Brazil. The institute contains a venom farm where researchers milk around a thousand snakes for their venom which is used to make antivenoms and for medical research.. The production units manufacture the following bioproducts: = Hyperimmune sera and antivenoms = * Anti-Bothropic * Anti-Crotalic * Anti-Bothropic-Crotalic * Anti-Elapidic * Anti-Bothropic-Lachetic * Anti-Escorpionic * Anti-Arachnidic * Anti-Lonomia * Anti-Africanized Bee * Anti-Diphtheric * Anti-Tetanic * Anti- Botulinic A, B, E * Anti-Rabies * Anti-Human Thymocytes = Vaccines = * Tetanus Toxoid * Diphtheria-tetanus vaccine (Pediatric and adult) * Triple vaccine: Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis * Recombinant Hepatitis B * BCG (intradermic) * Rabies (Vero Cell culture) = Biopharmaceuticals = * Botulin toxin * BCG (intravesical) * Monoclonal antibody: Anti-CD3 * Erythropoietin * Pulmonary surfactant  Public activities  The Butantan Institute is one of the major touristic and educational attractions in a vast park area in the city section of Butant√£ in S√£o Paulo. It has a serpentarium, a historical museum, a biological museum, and a museum of microbiology. The venom farm is a major attraction and visitors can see the snakes housed in representations of their natural environments. The park also contains rare tree types.  Butantan Foundation  The Funda√ß√£o Butantan is a non-profit corporation established in 1984 to use more efficiently public funds and capital investments made by the Ministry of Health for the production of immunobiologicals. The Foundation reinvests part of the proceeds to build new facilities for new products. Part of the funds are used in the Institute for research and cultural activities, as well as to provide its workers with meals and basic food supplies.  2010 fire  On May 15, 2010, a fire almost burned down the laboratory and destroyed the Institute's entire collection of snake specimens (approximately 85,000 specimens preserved with formaldehyde and stored in 70% ethanol) and ca. 450,000‚Äì500,000 specimens of scorpions and spiders (also stored in ethanol). It was one of the largest collections of snakes in the world. Over 90 years of research were lost. The fire started at and was brought under control by a crew of 50 firemen an hour and a half later. News reports have claimed that the facility was not prepared for a fire, not having a fire alarm or sprinkler system. Police are investigating the fire which has been described by curator Francisco Lu√≠s Franco as \\"a loss for humanity\\". None of the live animals or people at the institute was harmed by the fire.

Indian-standard coin of Theophilos, with bust of Herakles, and his club on reverse. Theophilos (Greek: ) was a minor Indo-Greek king who ruled for a short time in the Paropamisadae. He was possibly a relative of Zoilos I and is only known from coins. It is possible that some of Theophilos' coins in fact belong to another ruler, in Greek Bactria, during approximately the same period. Time of reign While Bopearachchi suggests c. 90 BCE, R. C. Senior believes that Theophilos ruled in the 130s BCE. Both numismatics do however suggest that the reigns of Theophilos and Nicias were adjacent. Coins of Theophilos Just like Zoilos I, Theophilos struck Indian silver coins with Herakles, a common symbol of the house of Euthydemus I, and the epithet Dikaios/Dhramikasa \\"The Just/Follower of the Dharma\\". The monograms are mostly the same as those of Nicias. The bronzes have similar inscriptions. Bronzes of Theophilos: Image:Theophilos-634.jpgHerakles with lion skin, and his club on the reverse. A Bactrian king Theophilos? However, there is a wholly different, and very rare, Attic coinage of a king Theophilos. Found in Bactria, these coins feature a reverse with a seated Athena with Nike, a different title Autokrator \\"Autocrat King\\" (), and also a separate monogram. Although this is not a very common occurrence on Indo-Greek coins, the coins of Theophilos have generally been accepted as belonging to one unique king. Bopearachchi has supported this proposition by pointing at the similarity between the portraits and the identical treatment of the diadem (one end straight, one end crooked). Against this, JakobssonJakobsson, J: Theophilos Autokrator, a last Bactrian king? ONS Journal 202 (2010). argues that the coins issued by the later Indo-Greek kings for export into Bactria were consistently similar to these kings' regular Indian coinage. Consequently, the coins of Theophilos Autokrator were not such export issues, but should belong to a Bactrian ruler. Jakobsson suggests that Theophilos Autokrator was a Bactrian princelet who briefly maintained himself in some part of Bactria, after the Hellenistic kingdom there had been vanquished by nomads, presumably in the 120s BCE.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1981, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Sterling Lyon. He was the son of John MacMaster and Jessie Campbell. In 1962, MacMaster married Lucille Rita Desjardins. MacMaster first ran for public office in the federal election of 1965, as a New Democrat in the northern Manitoba riding of Churchill. He received 3306 votes, finishing third behind Tory Robert Simpson and Liberal Francis Bud Jobin. At the time of the election, he described his occupation as \\"mine mechanic\\". He later left the NDP for the Progressive Conservatives, and was elected for the riding of Thompson in the provincial election of 1977, defeating incumbent New Democrat Ken Dillen by 916 votes. The Tories under Sterling Lyon won this election; as the sole Tory MLA from the province's north, MacMaster was appointed Minister of Northern Affairs on October 24, 1977, with responsibility for Renewable Resources and Transportation. He was relieved of the latter two responsibilities on October 20, 1978, and was named Minister of Labour and Manpower with responsibility for the Civil Service Commission. He was dropped as Northern Affairs minister on November 15, 1979, but kept his other responsibilities until the Lyon government was defeated in the election of 1981. MacMaster was himself defeated in the 1981 election, losing to New Democrat Steve Ashton by 72 votes. He has not sought a return to political life since this time, but is very involved in community activities and projects in the Lac du Bonnet area. MacMaster is also a private consultant, providing services such as mediation, public speaking, and arbitration.

He was a Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) from 1941 to 1974 and was one of only two men who during the Second World War enlisted in the British Army as a private and rose to the rank of brigadier, the other being future fellow Conservative MP Enoch Powell. Maclean wrote several books, including Eastern Approaches, in which he recounted three extraordinary series of adventures: travelling, often incognito, in Soviet Central Asia; fighting in the Western Desert campaign, where he specialised in commando raids behind enemy lines; and living rough with Josip Broz Tito and his Yugoslav Partisans while commanding the Maclean Mission there. It has been widely speculated that Ian Fleming used Maclean as one of his inspirations for James Bond. Early life Maclean was born in Cairo to Major Charles Wilberforce Maclean QOCH (1875‚Äì1953), a member of the Scottish landed gentry serving in Egypt with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and Frances Elaine Gladys Royle (12 June 1882 ‚Äì 1954), the only daughter of George Royle, a Royal Navy officer, and Fannie Jane Longueville Snow. The couple wed on 12 July 1905 at St George's Parish, Hanover Square, Middlesex, London. Heritage and education He was descended from the Macleans of Ardgour, a Sept of the Clan Maclean, whose chiefs have as their historic seat Duart Castle on the Isle of Mull in the Inner Hebrides. He was brought up in Italy and educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, where he read Classics and History. He then studied in Germany before joining the Diplomatic Service in 1933. In the Soviet Union In 1934 Fitzroy Maclean was posted to the British Embassy in Paris. Bored with the pleasant but undemanding routine, he requested a posting to Moscow in 1937. The two and a half years he spent in the Soviet Union formed the first third of his best known book, the autobiographical Eastern Approaches. Maclean was in Moscow until late 1939, and so was present during the great Stalinist purges, observing the fates of Bukharin and other Russian revolutionaries. Although he was stationed in the capital, Maclean travelled extensively, primarily by train, into remote regions of the USSR which were off limits to foreigners, and was shadowed by the NKVD as he did so. World War II When war broke out in 1939 Maclean was prevented from joining the military because of his position as a diplomat. He was 2nd Secretary in the Foreign Office. Therefore, he resigned from the Diplomatic Service \\"to go into politics\\". After tendering his resignation he immediately took a taxi to the nearest recruiting office and enlisted as a Private in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders. He was soon promoted to lance corporal and was commissioned in 1941. In that year he became the Conservative MP for Lancaster. In North Africa in 1942, he distinguished himself in the early actions of the newly formed Special Air Service (SAS), where, with Ralph A. Bagnold, he developed ways of driving vehicles over the Libyan sand \\"seas\\". Maclean was a brilliant practitioner in the T. E. Lawrence brand of fighting, and he reported directly to Winston Churchill in Cairo. A letter of introduction from David Stirling said of him at the end of this period: \\"He has done well on our raids. Don't be taken in by his rather pompous manner or his slow way of speaking - he is OK.\\"Ranfurly, Hermione, To War with Whitaker. The wartime diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly 1939-1945. p. 159. Mandarin Paperbacks 1995, . First published 1994, William Heinemann. =Persia and Iraq= Later that year he transferred to the Middle East as part of the Persia and Iraq Command. He was \\"allotted a platoon of Seaforth Highlanders and instructed to kidnap\\" General Fazlollah Zahedi, the commander of the Persian forces in the Isfahan area.Ranfurly, Hermione, To War with Whitaker.

Maclean captured him and smuggled him out by plane to internment in Palestine. This incident soon led Hitler's government to withdraw support from its network in Persia. =Yugoslavia= Churchill chose him to lead a liaison mission (Macmis) to central Yugoslavia in 1943. Josip Broz Tito and his Partisans were emerging as a major obstacle to German control of the Balkans. Little was known at the time about Tito: some suspected this was an acronym for a committee or that he might in fact be a young woman. Maclean got to know Tito well, and later produced two biographies of him. Maclean's relationship with Tito's Partisans was not always easy, partly because they were Communist, while he came from an upper class Scottish background, and had witnessed Stalinism in action (see above). As Churchill personally told him, Maclean's mission was not to concern himself with how Yugoslavia was to be run after the war, but \\"simply to find out who was killing the most Germans and suggest means by which we could help them to kill more.\\"Maclean, F: Eastern Approaches, p. 287. Jonathan Cape; Thirteenth Impression edition (1951) In the late summer of 1944, together with Tito, he planned and implemented Operation Ratweek. It was a major Allied bombing campaign in collaboration with the local Partisan troops in order to prevent German troops retreating back and reinforcing those in central and western Europe, thus prolonging the war. His biography of Tito reveals the admiration he held for the Yugoslav leader and the Yugoslav Communist-led anti-fascist struggle. He developed a great affection for Yugoslavia and its people and was later given permission to buy a house on the Dalmatian island of Korƒçula, Croatia.Obituary of Veronica Lady Maclean, timesonline.co.uk, 19 January 2005; accessed 10 July 2011. Having been appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1944, he received the Order of Kutuzov (Soviet Union) Maclean, Eastern Approaches (Pan paperback ed.) p. 391 (which impressed the Soviet troops in Belgrade), and after the war the Croix de Guerre (France), and Order of the Partisan Star (Yugoslavia). He reached the rank of Brigadier during the war, and was promoted to the local rank of Major General on 16 June 1947. Later life After Dark \\"Bloody Bosnia\\" in 1993 Maclean was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Lancaster in the 1941 by-election. He was re- elected from Lancaster in 1945, 1950, 1951, and 1955. He served briefly as a junior minister at the War Office from 1954‚Äì57. Harold Macmillan regretted losing him, \\"but he is really so hopeless in the House that he is a passenger in office ... a great pity, since he is so able.\\"Macmillan, Diaries, 1950-57, p. 615 thumb On 9 July 1949, Maclean laid the foundation stone of the Overton & District Memorial Hall in his Lancaster constituency. He had been President of the committee that had raised the money to purchase the land and build it. In the 1959 general election he switched constituencies to Bute and North Ayrshire, where he was elected as a Unionist (then the Scottish label for Conservatives). He was re-elected as a Unionist in 1964, and as a Conservative in 1966 and 1970. He retired at the February 1974 general election. In his last two years, he was appointed as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and Western European Union. Maclean was Executive Chair (1959-1970) and later President (1977-1987) of the GB-USSR Association. The Association, funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office [FCO], was a semi- official organization for cultural relations with the Soviet Union. Marriage He married Veronica Nell Fraser-Phipps (1920‚Äì2005), a Roman Catholic, in 1946. She was the daughter of the 16th Lord Lovat and widow of naval hero Lt. Alan Phipps, who was killed ashore at Leros in 1943. Sir Fitzroy and Lady Maclean had two sons: Charles Edward (born 1946) and Alexander James Simon Aeneas (\\"Jamie\\"; born 1949), who were brought up in their mother's faith. Charles is an author, well known for dark thrillers, including the cult classic The Watcher. Jamie became an art dealer and founded the Erotic Review. Maclean was also stepfather to his wife's children from her first marriage, Susan Rose \\"Sukie\\" Phipps (born 1941) and Jeremy Julian Phipps (born 1942), who were not brought up Catholic. Sukie married Richard St. Clair de la Mare, grandson of poet Walter de la Mare in 1959, then writer Derek Marlowe in 1968, and finally Captain Nicolas Paravicini in 1986. She had five children, and is stepmother to autistic savant Derek Paravicini. Jeremy became a Major General in the Army, having served in the SAS. Honours Sir Fitzroy was honoured with the baronetcy of Maclean of Strachur and Glensluain in 1957, was made the 15th Hereditary Keeper and Captain of Dunconnel Castle in 1981 and was made a knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle in 1994. In retirement Maclean wrote extensively. His wide range of subjects included: Scottish history, biographies (including Tito and Burgess), a Russian trilogy and assorted works of fiction. He also contributed to other books, for example writing the foreword to a 1984 biography of Joseph Wolff, the so-called \\"Eccentric Missionary\\" in whose footsteps he had travelled to Bukhara almost half a century before.Hopkins, Hugh Evan, Sublime vagabond: the life of Joseph Wolff - missionary extraordinary, foreword by Sir Fitzroy Maclean Bart, Worthing: Churchman, 1984; Maclean and his wife managed a hotel at Strachur.Hotel-keeping in the Highlands, The Countryman, Autumn 1977, pp 22-27 In 1964 he commissioned his wartime friend, fellow commando and yacht designer Alfred Mylne II, to build the motor yacht Judi of Bute for use around the West Coast of Scotland. Maclean was a patron of Strachur and District Shinty Club. He collected an extensive library, including a full set of early editions of James Bond novels, which sold in September 2008 for ¬£26,000.Lyon & Turnbull website, Edinburgh/London. retrieved 13 August 2013; One press report put the takings at ¬£31,000.

In the late 1960s, Maclean bought the Palazzo Boschi villa on the Adriatic island of Korƒçula (present-day Croatia), where he spent a good part of each year. Yugoslav legislation at the time barred foreigners from buying real-estate property, but Tito intervened to allow Maclean to do so. The town of Korƒçula was declared a free city, and the Macleans were declared its citizens. As soon as the purchase was registered with city authorities, the free city status was revoked. In 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Maclean and his wife delivered medical supplies to the island of Korƒçula, with a substantial contribution from the people of Rothesay and Bute. Death Sir Fitzroy Maclean died on 15 June 1996, aged 85, in England. Legacy Maclean was posthumously awarded the Order of Prince Branimir for the humanitarian aid to Croatia, as well as contributing to international affirmation of Croatia. The decoration was presented by the Croatian President Stjepan Mesiƒá in December 2001. Maclean may have been one of the models for Ian Fleming's character James Bond.

The company, which was founded in 1998, released eight titles before closing in 2013. History TimeGate Studios was founded in 1998 by Alan and Adel Chaveleh, who respectively served as chairman and president of the studio. The company had worked with industry publishers such as Vivendi Games, Take-Two Interactive, Atari, Ubisoft, SouthPeak Games, and Gamecock Media Group. =Releases= TimeGate Studios' debut real-time strategy game, Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns, won positive critical reception receiving several awards including ‚ÄúStrategy Game of the Year‚Äù in 2001 by Computer Gaming World, PC Gamer, and Computer Games Magazine. The standalone expansion pack, Kohan: Ahriman‚Äôs Gift, was released later that year and the company's relative success with the Kohan franchise earned it a nomination for ‚ÄúRookie Studio of the Year‚Äù from the IGDA in 2001. The studio released an addition to the Kohan series in September 2004 with the release of Kohan II: Kings of War, which was featured as a ‚ÄúTop 10 Game‚Äù in 2004 by Computer Games Magazine. In November 2004, TimeGate Studios and Atari released Axis & Allies, a real-time strategy game, based on the board game series of the same name, that let players play the role of World War II‚Äôs different factions. This title is currently TimeGate's best-selling release to date. The studio then began to develop in the genre of first-person shooters in October 2006 with the release of F.E.A.R. Extraction Point, an expansion pack for Vivendi‚Äôs horror game F.E.A.R (First Encounter Assault Recon.) F.E.A.R. Extraction Point was named ‚ÄúBest Expansion Pack of 2006‚Äù by PC Gamer. TimeGate Studios further propelled the F.E.A.R. series on the PC with the release of F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate in November 2007. The company released F.E.A.R. Files, a combination of both expansion packs, for the Xbox 360 in November 2007 as well. The studio then began production on Section 8, a sci-fi first-person shooter that was released on the Xbox 360 and PC in September 2009. Several months later, TimeGate released Section 8 on the PlayStation 3 in March 2010. Further sequels have been hinted upon by TimeGate stating, \\"...it has never been our intent for it to be a one-product franchise,\\" in reference to Section 8. On April 20, 2011, TimeGate released a digital downloadable sequel to the game called Section 8: Prejudice. In late 2012, TimeGate were involved in the development of the much-hyped science-fiction first-person shooter, Aliens: Colonial Marines. The game was outsourced to TimeGate by Borderlands developer Gearbox Software, who were originally assigned by publisher Sega to work on the Alien game. However, due to troubled development, the game was released in a rushed, incomplete state and received mostly negative reviews. Most issues were resolved with a post-release patch. Nevertheless, the state of the game upon initial release led to TimeGate laying off twenty-five members of its staff after its release. In 2013, it was announced that TimeGate was developing a new free-to-play game, titled Minimum, expected to be released at the end of the year. =Bankruptcy= On Wednesday, May 1, 2013, TimeGate Studios filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Texas Southern Bankruptcy Court, according to court documents obtained by Polygon. The petition filed by TimeGate listed total liabilities that ranged from $10 - $50 million, owed to creditors. Creditors included companies such as Unreal Engine developer Epic Games, online game service Agora Games, transmedia developer DJ2 Entertainment, video game agency Birthplace Management Group, and video game publisher Southpeak Interactive. TimeGate Studios faced $7.35 million in damages and lost the license for Section 8 as part of a fraud suit between itself and SouthPeak. In 2009, TimeGate sued Southpeak, claiming Southpeak had withheld royalties and failed to follow through with localizing the title \\"Section 8\\". SouthPeak countersued, claiming TimeGate hadn't invested enough of its own capital into the game's development, among other complaints. The two entered into arbitration with a third party, who ruled in favor of SouthPeak, awarding SouthPeak $7.35 million in compensatory damages and control of the Section 8 license. In March 2013, this ruling was overturned in a federal court. In April 2013, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit filed to reverse and remand the prior March ruling, reinstating the arbitration award for SouthPeak. SouthPeak Interactive looked to convert TimeGate's Chapter 11 bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation, which would mean a studio closure for TimeGate. It was reported later in May that the studio had closed.

These terms are relevant operators‚Äîi.e. operators whose coefficients have a positive dimension of mass‚Äîthough there are some exceptions. A model with soft SUSY breaking was proposed in 1981 by Howard Georgi and Savas Dimopoulos. Before this, dynamical models of supersymmetry breaking were being used that suffered from giving rise to color and charge breaking vacua. Soft SUSY breaking decouples the origin of supersymmetry breaking from its phenomenological consequences. In effect, soft SUSY breaking adds explicit symmetry breaking to the supersymmetric Standard Model Lagrangian. The source of SUSY breaking results from a different sector where supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. Divorcing the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking from the supersymmetric Standard Model leads to the notion of mediated supersymmetry breaking. Example operators * Gaugino mass * Scalar masses * Scalar trilinear interactions (\\"A-terms\\") Nonholomorphic Soft Supersymmetry Breaking Interactions In low energy supersymmetry based models, the soft supersymmetry breaking interactions excepting the mass terms are usually considered to be holomorphic functions of fields. While a superpotential such as that of MSSM needs to be holomorphic, there is no reason why soft supersymmetry breaking interactions are required to be holomorphic functions of fields . Of course, an arbitrary nonholomorphic interaction may invite an appearance of quadratic divergence (or hard supersymmetry breaking); however, there are scenarios with no gauge singlet fields where nonholomorphic interactions can as well be of soft supersymmetry breaking type . One may consider a hidden sector based supersymmetry breaking, with X and \\\\Phi to be chiral superfields. Then, there exist nonholomorphic D-term contributions of the forms \\\\frac{1}{M^3} [XX^*\\\\Phi^2\\\\Phi^*]_D ~and~ \\\\frac{1}{M^3} [XX^*D^\\\\alpha\\\\Phi D_\\\\alpha\\\\Phi]_D that are soft supersymmetry breaking in nature. The above lead to nonholomorphic trilinear soft terms like \\\\phi^2\\\\phi^* and an explicit Higgsino soft mass term like \\\\psi \\\\psi in the Lagrangian. The coefficients of both \\\\phi^2\\\\phi^* and \\\\psi \\\\psi terms are proportional to \\\\frac{F^2}{M^3} , where F is the vacuum expectation value of the auxiliary field components of X and M is the scale of mediation of supersymmetry breaking. Away from MSSM, there can be higgsino-gaugino interactions like \\\\psi \\\\lambda that are also nonholomorphic in nature.

It is the third book in the Honor Harrington series. Its title comes from a quotation by Vyacheslav von Plehve in reference to the Russo-Japanese War: \\"What this country needs is a short, victorious war to stem the tide of revolution.\\" That quotation is one of the novel's two epigraphs; the other is a quotation from Robert Wilson Lynd: \\"The belief in the possibility of a short decisive war appears to be one of the most ancient and dangerous of human illusions.\\" Plot summary The People's Republic of Haven finds itself teetering at the edge of economic disaster. Unable to maintain its massive welfare state in the face of inflation and deficit and with opposition to the government getting bolder, the leaders of the People's Republic decide to resort to war against Manticore. A short, victorious war, they believe, will both distract the proles from their current economic problems and allow them to use the riches of the Manticore system to prop up their welfare state. Meanwhile, Honor returns to duty after injuries she sustained in The Honor of the Queen to command the brand-new battlecruiser HMS Nike, the pride of the Royal Manticoran Navy, with some of her old crew aboard and with her old Academy friend Michelle Henke as executive officer. But on their way to her post, the engineers of the Nike discover a flaw in one of her fusion reactors, which hampers her first operational deployment to the critical Manticoran base at Hancock Station. Honor spends the time her ship is in dock by beginning her first real romantic relationship with the senior engineering officer of Hancock Station's maintenance facility, Captain Junior Grade Paul Tankersley. The Havenites start the war Honor had been struggling to prevent in the previous books. Their plan is to launch probing missions on Manticoran Alliance members to push the Alliance into re-deploying its forces to create weak points and allow them to strike at Manticore directly. They are aided greatly in this through the use of Project Argus, stealthy sensor platforms purchased from the Solarian League and planted in Alliance systems to watch the movements of Manticore forces. Havenite ships on ballistic courses with no active systems are able to collect the data dumps from the sensor platforms without being detected by Manticore forces. When Admiral Sarnow's superior deploys most of Hancock Station's ships to other star systems to guard against further Havenite provocation, the Argus net allows the Havenites to see this weakness in the Manticore position, and they decide to attack Hancock Station in force. Honor joins Admiral Mark Sarnow's fleet alongside her old enemy, Pavel Young. With most of the Royal Manticoran Navy deployed elsewhere to prevent the Havenite provocations, Honor and Admiral Sarnow find themselves forced to defend Hancock Station from a vastly superior Havenite armada. With the help of Honor's unorthodox tactics, the task force is able to hold off the Havenites for long enough for reinforcements to arrive. In the final stages of the battle Pavel Young, startled by an impact on his ship and technically in command of the formation, orders the formation to scatter. Honor, realizing the battle can still be won by quickly closing Manticore reinforcements, reassembles the fleet, resulting in a crushing Havenite defeat. At the end of the novel, Young is removed from command, placed under arrest and is to be court-martialed at Manticore. Capt. Tankersley is promoted to Captain of the List and ordered back to Manticore aboard Nike for reassignment. After the first disastrous battles of the war, three Havenite revolutionaries‚ÄîRobert S. Pierre, Oscar Saint-Just, and Cordelia Ransom‚Äîlead the overthrow of their \\"Legislaturalist\\" government by killing hereditary President Harris and nearly his entire government during his birthday celebration with an air strike by shuttles of the Havenite Navy. They blame the killings on the Navy, and using the fear of a possible military coup form a ¬®Committee of Public Safety¬® to rule the People's Republic \\"until a new government can be formed\\". They begin a purge of senior military officers and political figures to cement their rule. This novel is much less Honor-centered than the previous two, and the war is depicted from many perspectives.

Speakers' Corner is a television series that aired weekly on Citytv and A (formerly A-Channel) stations in Canada, later CTV Two) from 1990 to 2008, featuring numerous short segments on a variety of topics as recorded by members of the general public in the form of rants, big-ups, shoutouts, jokes, music performances, etc. After the video was complete, it was edited for television. The show was an example of Citytv founder Moses Znaimer's philosophy of interactive broadcasting,\\"Speakers Corner: an oral history\\". The Grid, January 7, 2014. and essentially created what some 21st-century media outlets would retroactively label as a precursor to YouTube. History Speakers' Corner began in 1990 with a video booth outside the Citytv studios in Toronto.\\"Six Toronto TV shows ahead of their time\\". Toronto Star, Ed Conroy, March 25, 2016 The booth's original intent was for viewers to record news commentary and \\"letter to the editor\\" segments for broadcast on CityPulse, but the booth soon proved so popular, with many segments being recorded that fell far outside the initial concept, that the decision was soon made to create a full half-hour weekly series. Segments that were relevant in a news context continued to appear on CityPulse,\\"A day in the life of CityPulse\\". National Post, August 24, 2002. and entertainment-oriented segments also sometimes appeared on other CHUM television outlets, such as MuchMusic and Space, as interstitials. (The concept pre-dated CITY, with Keeble Cable pitching the idea in 1970.) The series' theme music was composed and performed by Graeme Kirkland.\\"A different drummer: Graeme Kirkland goes from public nuisance to colourful fixture without missing a beat\\". Ottawa Citizen, September 5, 1998. Within the series, segments selected for broadcast would be organized around themes, with several clips on similar or interrelated topics airing together. Sometimes an entire episode would revolve around a single theme, while other times several distinct themes would be presented over the course of an episode. Several local celebrities were created by the show. The then-unknown Barenaked Ladies received their first widespread publicity, prior to the release of The Yellow Tape, by performing their future hit single \\"Be My Yoko Ono\\" in the Speakers' Corner booth before a live show at The Rivoli in early 1991. The following year, they made a repeat appearance on the program in a bid to leverage their newfound fame into a publicity boost for Rheostatics' new album Whale Music.\\"Rheostatics win fans ad mare usque ad mare\\". Toronto Star, November 12, 1992. Musician Jesse Labelle also received his first significant break as a result of Speakers' Corner, being invited to join FeFe Dobson's band after his performance in the booth was broadcast.\\"Jesse Labelle isn't in love, but he sure likes to sing about it\\". Vancouver Sun, June 5, 2010. Actor Scott Speedman got his first opportunity to audition for a major film role, in Batman Forever, because of a Speakers' Corner appearance;\\"Of course Canada has a star system - it's just different from Hollywood's\\". The Globe and Mail, August 29, 1998. although he didn't get the role, the contacts and experience he gained from the audition opened up other opportunities for him. In later years, street entertainer Zanta used both Speakers' Corner and performances outside the streetfront studio of Citytv's Breakfast Television as a springboard to local notoriety.\\"The Zanta clause\\". National Post, February 17, 2007. The Devil's Advocates, a comedy duo who presented themselves as devil-horned spokesmen for Satan, became a staple of the program with a recurring routine in which they responded to and satirized other Speakers' Corner clips that had aired in the previous week. The Devil's Advocates, Second City alumni Albert Howell and Andrew Currie, became so popular that at least one special episode of the series was devoted entirely to their clips. For part of their stint on the series, Harry, a senior citizen who disliked their style of comedy, would regularly record videos criticizing them, which turned into an ongoing war of words between him and the Advocates.\\"Devilish duo score heavenly CTV deal\\". The Globe and Mail, October 19, 1998. Howell and Currie stopped appearing regularly on Speakers' Corner when they were given their own show, Improv Heaven and Hell, on The Comedy Network in 1998. Some established celebrities, including Madonna, Harrison Ford, Mike Myers and Jean Chr√©tien, also recorded Speaker's Corner segments. Some recorded segments were too extreme for broadcast, including sexual or scatological situations,\\"Real people doing some really strange things in \`The Booth'\\". National Post, November 9, 1998. although some such segments were screened as entertainment at private staff parties. On at least a few occasions, CHUM staffers also used the booth as a way to go over their own manager's head with a request for a pay raise or a promotion. Versions of the show began on other regional CHUM-owned television stations such as CHRO in Ottawa and CFPL in London. Citytv Bogot√° (which licensed the brand from CHUM) also launched its own Speaker's Corner booth called Citycapsula when it signed on in 1996; unlike the Canadian versions, Citycapsula is free. An Alberta version, Speakers' Corner Alberta, aired on Access TV from October 2003 until April 2008. In the fall of 2006 the Citytv stations in Calgary and Edmonton started airing the AccessTV Speaker's Corner Alberta as they were both owned by CHUM. Speakers' Corner Alberta was cancelled in April 2008 due to changes in both companies. A French version of Speakers' Corner, called VoxPop, operated at MusiquePlus in Montreal. It operated from the early 1990s until the early 2000s. Rogers Media, which had acquired the Citytv stations from CHUM Limited in 2007, announced the cancellation of the series on August 31, 2008.\\"15 reasons we miss Speakers Corner\\". Aux, March 21, 2014. According to the company, the 21st-century emergence of other interactive media, such as YouTube and social media, had diminished the cultural value of Speaker's Corner. Rogers revived Speaker's Corner in a digital format on March 26, 2014, as a one-night only opportunity for voters to comment and offer feedback on that day's candidates' debate in the 2014 Toronto mayoral election. Operation Each Speakers' Corner booth consisted of a video camera, recording technology and in most cases a coin slot. Any member of the general public could enter a Speakers' Corner booth, deposit a coin (normally one dollar), then record a short video segment on any topic. Each segment was limited to a maximum of two minutes, but the content was determined by the person using the booth. Typically, the Speakers' Corner Alberta (as well as the ones in London Ontario) booths were free, offered a few questions, and usually had a limit of 60 seconds. The show's producers then reviewed the booth recordings and selected the \\"compelling\\" segments. The broadcast segments traditionally were presented in a campy atmosphere, with each segment (such as \\"rants\\", \\"complaints\\", \\"kudos\\", etc.) being introduced over clips of B-grade 1950s and 1960s sci-fi movies. Later in the show's run, however, it took on a more polished feel, and included text messages on-screen from viewers during broadcast. Money collected from the Speakers' Corner booths went to charity. Booth locations A-Channel Victoria building. Speakers' Corner booths were located in: * British Columbia ** Vancouver (CKVU): 180 West 2nd Avenue (station building), Tom Lee Music on Granville Street, MarketPlace IGA at Smithe and Burrard Streets, plus outside Vancouver proper at Coquitlam Centre, and at Metropolis at Metrotown ** Victoria (CIVI): Broad Street and Pandora Avenue (station building) ** Nanaimo (CIVI) * Alberta ** Calgary (Access, CKAL): Citytv Building, 535 7th Avenue SW, Calgary ** Edmonton (Access, CKEM): West Edmonton Mall * Ontario **London (CFPL): Galleria Mall, and Covent Garden Market.

A new booth was planned to be established at Citytv's new facility at 33 Dundas Street East, but the show was cancelled before this could happen. The ChumCity Store was also a booth location at times. ** Windsor (CHWI): Palace Cinemas Building, 300 Ouellette Avenue (South-east corner of University Avenue and Ouellette Avenue) For other Citytv and A-Channel outlets, either there was no Speakers' Corner program for that market, or the booth locations are not currently known. In Alberta, Access: The Education Station, which was the provincial broadcaster (now CTV Two Alberta) owned by CTVglobemedia, operated Speakers Corner. Mobile booths were also available to increase public access. These were occasionally deployed at special events but were not for private use. There were many requests to rent a mobile video recording booth for weddings and corporate events.

It is located at 1949 Kipling Avenue just north of Belfield Road, close to the junction of Highways 401 and 409. Overview The station has 3 mainline tracks and a single platform serving only the northernmost track. A fourth track passes along the north side of the station, but it is only used for local freight access so it is fenced off from the platform. The platform can accommodate trains up to 12 cars long, and is heated to melt snow in winter. History The station opened in late 1974, less than a year after GO Transit began operating the Georgetown (now Kitchener) line. In 2013, construction began on the Georgetown South railway expansion project. In order to accommodate a widened railway and a significantly increased number of express trains, the original tracks and platforms were demolished and replaced. While the previous arrangement had been a 2-track railway with a side platform on the south side, the new configuration would be a 3-track railway with a side platform on the north side. The north parking lot was expanded to accommodate a new passenger pick-up and drop-off area and a bus loop, and the station building was also upgraded. Until 29 June 2019, GO Transit operated connecting bus service at the station on route 38A, which operated during peak periods between Etobicoke North and Caledon via Humber College, Woodbridge and Bolton. Future , Metrolinx is considering replacing its Etobicoke North GO Station with a new GO station about 2 kilometres west, near Woodbine Racetrack. Demolishing the current Etobicoke North station would free up space for the railway to be widened from 3 mainline tracks to 4. Services The station is served by Kitchener line local train services, but not Kitchener line bus services or express train services. As a result, there is no service on weekends. Because the station only has a single platform, there is also no service during peak periods in the counter-peak direction. Via Rail, UP Express and GO Transit express trains pass through the station without stopping. It is the only station along the Union Pearson Express route where those trains do not stop. The spur line to Pearson International Airport branches away approximately four kilometres west of the station, just past the underpass with Highway 427. Connecting transit The closest bus stops are a short distance south on Kipling Avenue at Belfield Road, served by Toronto Transit Commission routes 45 Kipling & 945 Kipling Express. The station is connected by staircases and ramps from Kipling Avenue, which crosses below the tracks.

In the book Introduced in Chapter Four (\\"Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\") and the main center of interest of Chapter V (\\"Advice from a Caterpillar\\"), the Caterpillar is a hookah-smoking caterpillar exactly three inches high (a height, the virtues of which, he defends against Alice's complaint). Alice does not like the Caterpillar when they first meet, because he does not immediately talk to her and when he does, it is usually in short, rather rude sentences, or difficult questions. The original illustration by John Tenniel is something of a visual paradox, wherein the caterpillar's human face appears to be formed from the head and legs of a naturalistic caterpillar. In other media The Caterpillar makes an appearance in a few other places outside Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: * The Caterpillar appeared the novel The Looking-Glass Wars and he plays the role of an oracle. * In the SyFy TV miniseries Alice, the Caterpillar is the leader of the underground resistance to the Queen of Hearts. * The Caterpillar also makes an appearance in \\"Curiouser and Curiouser,\\" an episode of the television show Forever Knight, in the form of a child's toy. * In the ‚Äò‚ÄôMurdoch Mysteries‚Äô‚Äô TV show episode ‚ÄúMurdoch in Wonderland,‚Äù the titular character is framed for murder following an ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù themed costume party.

He is the wisest denizen in Wonderland and provides guidance to Alice in both games. *The Caterpillar makes a cameo appearance in the Sunsoft's 2006 mobile game . The Caterpillar appears only in one scenario branch of the bad endings, warning Ariko (the \\"Alice\\" of the game) that Cheshire Cat has become dangerous, but is shortly squished to death by Cheshire Cat. The Caterpillar takes the form of a miniature human man in a green sleeping bag. * In several Marvel Comics stories featuring Doctor Strange, the magical entity Agamotto has appeared in a form resembling the Caterpillar. * In popular music, the Caterpillar is mentioned in Jefferson Airplane's \\"White Rabbit\\" (1967), a song containing many references to the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. * In the 2003 horror crossover film Freddy vs. Jason, Freddy Kreuger takes the form of the Caterpillar and smokes a hookah in Freeburg's dream. * In one episode of Ouran High School Host Club called \\"Haruhi in Wonderland\\", Kyoya Otori is dressed as the Caterpillar. * The Caterpillar appears in the Mad T Party at Disney's California Adventure park, where he plays the keyboard. * The Caterpillar is also referenced in Melanie Martinez's song Mad Hatter. * The Caterpillar turned moth is also a main male character in The Splintered Series by A.G. Howard, in this series his name is Morpheus *Vladimir Nabokov refers to \\"the elenctic tones of Lewis Carroll's caterpillar\\" when describing the voice of a \\"stupid and suspicious\\" hotel manager in The Real Life of Sebastian Knight. * In Magical Girl Raising Project 4th arc named \\"JOKERS\\", a character named Uttakatta is based in the Caterpillar, several characters in the franchise were based in Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland Characters.

In the Disney animated film, this line is visualised as exhalations of smoke in the shapes \\"O\\", \\"R\\" and \\"U\\". Alice remarks in the original story that the Caterpillar will one day turn into a butterfly, and in both the 1999 television film and Disney's 1951 version he does so in Alice's presence. He is voiced by Richard Haydn. The Caterpillar in the Disney film is a blue creature who, as in the original Carroll story, smokes a hookah. He is seen as a very forthright character as he yells at Alice quite often during the scenes in which they both appear. He blows smoke in Alice's face and when she needs assistance he ignores her. He is a quite mean character providing little to no assistance to Alice and ends up confusing her more while she is trapped in Wonderland. He then ignores her and turns into a butterfly and flutters away not caring whether or not Alice makes it out alive. He also instructs her to eat a mushroom but does not say what it does thus putting her into possible danger. He briefly appears during the second caucus race. He reappears one final time during the ending chase, still in butterfly form but once again smoking on his hookah, and again ignoring Alice when she asks for his help escaping the Queen of Hearts. =Tim Burton films= Alan Rickman voices the Caterpillar, who in this adaptation is named Absolem. (early draft of the film script, first started Feb. 2007) Rickman was filmed while recording his voice in a studio, but his face was not composited onto the character's face as originally planned. He appears five times in the movie. The first time is outside Wonderland, when a young man named Hamish Ascot is about to propose to Alice and she notices a blue caterpillar on his shoulder. The second time is when Nivens McTwisp the White Rabbit, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Mallymkun the Dormouse, and the Uilleam the Dodo consider Alice's identity, and they consult him. Absolem appears in a thick cloud of hookah smoke, which he blows at Alice. He appears again after Alice arrives at the White Queen's Castle, and again to remind Alice of her previous visit to Wonderland. He blows smoke at her twice this time, and Alice asks him to stop it. At the end of the movie, Absolem, as a butterfly, appears on Alice's shoulder as she sets off for China. Rickman reprises the role in Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016), though he remains a butterfly, leading Alice to the looking-glass portal to Underland and informing her that matters require her urgent attention. He isn't seen again for the rest of the film but makes a cameo in the credits. This was also his final film performance and the film is dedicated in his memory. =Once Upon a Time= * The Caterpillar appears in an episode of Once Upon a Time, voiced by Roger Daltrey. * The Caterpillar appears in the Once Upon a Time in Wonderland episode \\"Forget Me Not\\" voiced by Iggy Pop, wherein he operates a meeting-house for the transaction of criminal business. He is consulted twice by Alice for assistance in an adventure of her own.

It is the fifth book in the Honor Harrington series. In the story, the disgraced Honor enters a self-imposed exile on Grayson.  Plot summary  After the scandal caused by killing Pavel Young in a duel, Honor retreats to Grayson until things settle down on Manticore. She intends to oversee the development of her Steading, and overcome the death of Paul Tankersley. Honor struggles with the survivor's guilt her many battles have left her with, but soon finds that she cannot afford to dwell on her emotions. With the war between Manticore and Haven still raging, the fast-expanding but still inexperienced Grayson Space Navy needs someone to put it in fighting shape. Honor is eventually given the rank of admiral in the Grayson navy and command of a superdreadnought squadron. She conducts her squadron and the rest of her adoptive nation's fleet through several battle exercises to improve them. Meanwhile, Haven stages a new operation capturing two planets deep in Alliance territory. A Manticore task force and half the Grayson Navy leave to liberate these planets, but Haven was banking on this and now are sending another task force to destroy Grayson's orbital infrastructure and arm its rival planet, Masada, with modern weapons. The events surrounding Honor's last adventure on Grayson have caused political turmoil on the reactionary, patriarchal planet. Even though she has the support of Protector Benjamin Mayhew IX and the Grayson government, and the respect and gratitude of the people of Grayson, several of her fellow Steadholders refuse to accept her and plot to bring down Mayhew's reforms by resorting to terrorism. They sabotage a dome which was being built and financed by Honor. The dome collapses mid- construction and kills dozens of young children. When it appears that the government discovered their conspiracy, they attempt to assassinate Honor but this fails as well. Reverend Julius Hanks, the head of the Grayson Church, gives his life to shield Honor from an assassin's fire, and the assassin is so horrified by his act that he surrenders to police custody and makes a full confession as to the conspiracy and its leader. When confronted at an assembly of the Steadholders, the leader invokes his ancient right to trial by combat and Honor herself, acting in her official capacity as Protector Benjamin's Champion, meets him sword-to-sword and kills him. Shortly thereafter the Havenite task force arrives to destroy Grayson's orbital infrastructure, but underestimating the size of the remaining Grayson Navy they release their contingent destined for Masada before engaging and being defeated by Honor and the ships under her command. The released contingent turns to engage Grayson's now battle-damaged ships, but are bluffed into thinking that Honor's ships are not as badly damaged as they actually are and that reinforcements are in system, so they retreat back to Havenite space. The other leading member of the conspiracy, desperate to keep himself safe, has most of his co- conspirators assassinated and personally votes for the government to heap even more accolades and titles on Honor.  Themes  The book's depiction of Alfredo Yu, the redeemed ex-Havenite captain, starts the series' trend towards showing many of the Havenites as decent people on a personal level. = Author's note = An author's note from David Weber at the end of the book describes Weber's sorrow about the Oklahoma City bombing, which was somewhat similar to the destruction of Williard Mueller Middle School in the story and occurred after the writing of Flag in Exile, but before its publication.David Weber.

It was a Jesuit student hall of residence at Lower Hatch St. in Dublin, Ireland. Founded by the Jesuits in 1913, University Hall provided accommodation for third level male students studying in Dublin until its closure in 2004. The Jesuits promoted a spirit of 'Friendship, Faith, Involvement', and the hall was well known for its community spirit. The hall's motto was Sic Luceat Lux Vestra; in this way let your light shine The building was acquired by Red Carnation Hotels for ‚Ç¨20m in 2019 and is to be converted into a 5 star luxury boutique hotel. History The architect for the building was CB Powell. Initially the hall catered to only a small number of students, mostly studying medicine in UCD, but its intake grew progressively larger throughout the twentieth century to a yearly average of over 100 male students. In 2004 the property was bought by Gerry Barrett, a property developer from Galway (Ireland). It is understood that he intends to develop the hall into a hotel. The building is currently a Direct Provision centre being used as accommodation for asylum seekers and refugees. Culture The undisputed annual highlight of the Hall's calendar was the 'Hatch Ball' a large formal dinner held in the nearby Shelbourne hotel. It was by no means, however, the only social gathering; with intermittent discos in nearby nightclubs, nightly parties in private rooms usually proceeding to Dublin nightclubs and regular excursions to the beloved local pub, Hartigans of Leeson Street, the social scene was always vibrant. The hall also supported a number of societies including film, debating and photography. The management actively encouraged hall residents to become active members of the local community through charity events and homework clubs. Former residents of Hatch hall still meet socially in Hartigans pub on the first Wednesday of every calendar month; a social gathering known as \\"Hatch Wednesday\\". Past residents of the hall have included Desmond O'Malley, founder and former leader of the Progressive Democrats; Brian Cowen T.D and Michael O'Leary, Ryanair CEO.

History No. 12 Group was first formed in April 1918 at Cranwell, Lincolnshire, within No. 3 Area. It succeeded the Royal Navy's Central Depot and Training Establishment which had been training naval aviators at Cranwell since 1916. The first RAF General Officer Commanding was Brigadier-General H D Briggs who received the appointment on promotion from Captain in the Royal Navy. On 8 May 1918 the group transferred to Midland Area, and then to Northern Area on 18 October 1919. On 1 November that year the Group ceased to exist when it became the RAF (Cadet) College. The group was reformed on 1 April 1937 in Fighter Command. It was the group responsible for aerial defence of the Midlands, Norfolk, Lincolnshire and North Wales. Construction of a purpose built site at RAF Watnall was not completed until late 1940, after which operations were relocated from nearby RAF Hucknall. During World War II this group was the second most important group of Fighter Command, and as such, it received its share of attacks from the German Luftwaffe throughout the war. The commander of 12 Group during the Battle of Britain was Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh- Mallory, who was a rather ambitious man. Despite his length of service in the RAF, he was passed over for being named the Air Officer Commanding of the more vital 11 Group in favour of Air Vice Marshal Keith Park. Leigh-Mallory felt himself slighted over this and his relations with Park were poisoned thereafter. As well as regional defence, 12 Group were also supposed to fly cover for 11 Group airfields during the Battle of Britain, but several times, these fields were left undefended. When Park complained about it, Leigh- Mallory responded that in order to test his Big Wing theory (espoused by Squadron Leader Douglas Bader), more time was needed to get the necessary squadrons airborne. The Big Wings met with mixed success, enough for the Air Ministry to use it as an excuse to oust Park and Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding from their commands on the grounds that they had mismanaged the Battle of Britain. After Park was ousted, Leigh-Mallory took over 11 Group. 12 Group still continued its assignment of defending the Midlands and supporting both 10 Group and 11 Group. 12 Group remained in being after the war. It was renamed No. 12 (East Anglian) Sector on 31 March 1963. On 30 April 1968, as the new Strike Command came into existence, 12 Group passed into history.

It lies on the left bank of the Calavon, east of Avignon. It is the principal town of the Luberon mountains. The town has notoriety for defining the Aptian age of the Early Cretaceous.  Geography  Apt lies north of Aix-en-Provence and the river Durance, in the valley of the river Calavon, (also called the Coulon), and at the foot of the north-facing slopes of the Luberon mountain.  Geological age  Apt is the etymological source of the Aptian, an age in the geologic timescale, a subdivision of the Early or Lower Cretaceous epoch or series and encompasses the time from 125.0 ¬± 1.0 Ma to 112.0 ¬± 1.0 Ma (million years ago), approximately.Gradstein et al. (2004) The original type locality is in the vicinity of Apt. The Aptian was introduced in scientific literature by French palaeontologist Alcide d'Orbigny in 1840.  History  Apt was at one time the chief town of the Vulgientes, a Gallic tribe; it was destroyed by the Romans about 125 BC and restored by Julius Caesar, who conferred upon it the title Apta Julia; it was much injured by the Lombards and the Saracens, but its fortifications were rebuilt by the counts of Provence. A traditional tale attributes the foundation of the bishopric of Apt to a saint named Auspicus, whom Pope Clement I sent and who died a martyr in 102; but the first documented evidence of its existence is in the acts of the Synod of Arles of 314, at which Apt was represented by a priest and an exorcist. Early 5th-century bishop Saint Castor of Apt is mentioned in contemporary liturgical documents and in a 419 letter of Pope Boniface I. The diocese appears in documents of the same century as a suffragan of Aix. As a result of the concordat of 15 July 1801 between Pope Pius VII and Napoleon Bonaparte, the territory of the diocese was incorporated by the bull Qui Christi Domini of 29 November of the same year mainly into the archdiocese of Avignon, with some parishes going instead to the diocese of Digne.Joseph Hyacinthe Alban√®s, Gallia christiana novissima, Tomo I, Montb√©liard 1899, coll. 173-304Louis Duchesne, Fastes √©piscopaux de l'ancienne Gaule, vol.

They are known as the Apt Manuscript and the Ivrea Codex. They contain motets and mass movements, all of which are polyphonic. Nine out of fourteen Motets by Philippe de Vitry are recorded in the Ivrea Codex, a compilation of eighty- one compositions dating to 1360. It is purported to have been derived from the repertoire used in the Papal Palace at Avignon, since it is so close and offers a sampling of music from the Ars Nova movement. = Jewish history = According to documentation, Jews lived in Apt as early as the second half of the 14th century. The earliest documentation of Jews in Apt is dated back to the second half of the 13th century, describing the prohibition of meat selling by Jews to Christians. Columbia University Library owns a twelve documents collection of notarial written money lending transactions between Jews and Christians in Apt. One of them describes a transaction between a local Jew called Gartus Bonafossi and a Christian named Iohannes Raymundi.https://exhibitions.cul.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/hebrew_mss/communities A synagogue was documented as soon as 1416, and around 15 Jewish families were listed by the tax register by 1420. By then, Apt became the fourth largest Jewish community of Provence. The Jewish quarter was situated by the nowadays Place du Postel, and the community itself was mentioned in the writings of the poet Isaac Gorni.  Ecclesiastical history  The City Hall in 2008 The council of Apt was held on 14 May 1365 in the cathedral of that city by the archbishops and bishops of the provinces of Arles, Embrun and Aix-en-Provence, in the south of France. Twenty-eight decrees were published and eleven days of indulgence were granted to those who would visit with pious sentiments the church of the Blessed Virgin in the Diocese of Apt on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross and venerate there certain relics of the Cross.  Sights  The chief object of interest is the church of Sainte-Anne (once the cathedral), the building of which was begun about the year 1056 on the site of a much older edifice, but not completed until the latter half of the 17th century. The town was formerly surrounded by massive ancient walls, but these have now been for the most part replaced by boulevards; many of its streets are narrow and irregular. Many Roman remains have been found in and near the town. A fine bridge, the Pont Julien, spanning the Coulon below the town, dates from 2 BC. Archeologists and others now believe that the Pont Julien dates much later than the 2nd century  Economy  The region is a center for wine, honey, truffles, and fruit, much of which is converted to crystallized fruit by both industrial and handmade processes.

Both teams plan many aspects of their plays (offense) and response to plays (defense), such as what formations they take, who they put on the field, and the roles and instructions each player are given. Throughout a game, each team adapts to the other's apparent strengths and weaknesses, trying various approaches to outmaneuver or overpower their opponent in order to win the game. Offensive strategy The goal of the offense is, most generally, to score points. In order to accomplish this goal, coaches and players plan and execute plays ‚Äì based on a variety of factors: The players involved, the opponent's defensive strategy, the amount of time remaining before halftime or the end of the game, and the number of points needed to win the game. Strategically, the offense can prolong their possession of the ball to prevent the opponent from scoring. Offensive scoring chances, or drives, end when they cannot move the ball 10 yards or the ball is turned over via fumble or interception. =Offensive players= On offense, there are three types of players: linemen, backs, and receivers. These players' positions and duties on the field vary from one offensive scheme to another. The position names (as well as the abbreviations recognized by coaches, players, and fans) vary from one team's playbook to another, but what follow are among the most commonly used: Linemen (This is understood to be players on the line other than at the ends; also referred to as \\"interior linemen\\". The ends‚Äîi.e., the players at the ends of the line‚Äîare discussed below under \\"Receivers\\".) * Center: The Center (\\"C\\") is the player who snaps the ball to the quarterback. Like the other four linemen, his job consists of both run blocking (pushing the defenders away from the ball carrier on a running play) and pass blocking (stopping the defenders from disrupting or tackling the quarterback). The center is also usually responsible for calling the blocking schemes on the line, telling the other linemen which defenders to block. * Guard: Guards (\\"G\\") line up on both sides of the center. The guards are generally bigger than the center and are typically better run blockers than pass blockers. * Tackle: Tackles (\\"T\\") are the \\"bookends\\" of the offensive line. They are usually the biggest offensive linemen (at the NFL level they are typically at least , and can be as tall as ), but also must have great hand and foot coordination to successfully protect against pass rushes. If a team has a right-handed quarterback, the left tackle is usually the best pass blocker on the line since they are responsible for preventing a \\"blindside\\" pass rush the quarterback might not see. Right tackles have the same responsibilities with left-handed quarterbacks. Backs Backs are so named because they line up behind (in back of) the line of scrimmage at the start of the play. * Quarterback: The Quarterback (\\"QB\\") lines up directly behind the center, where he takes the ball (in an action called the 'snap') and puts it into play. The quarterback's primary duty is either passing (throwing) the ball or handing the ball to a running back (\\"RB\\") who carries the ball downfield. In some cases the quarterback is called upon to run the ball downfield himself, either because the play is designed that way or the quarterback has no other options available. A quarterback can even act as a receiver, catching a pass thrown by another player during a \\"trick play\\". In most cases, the quarterback also communicates to the other players the play they are going to run, both in the huddle before the team lines up to execute the play and immediately before the ball snap. Quarterbacks must be able to throw the ball accurately, read defenses, and make quick, correct decisions. As the leader of the offense, the Quarterback is considered by many to be the most important player on the offensive field. * Fullback: The Fullback (\\"FB\\") lines up behind the quarterback and is involved in running, blocking, and (in some cases) catching passes. In many offensive schemes the fullback is considered to be a running back, but this player is usually bigger and more physical than other running backs on the team and is more involved in blocking than in running or receiving. * Halfback: The Halfback (\\"HB\\"), also referred to as a \\"tailback\\" (\\"TB\\") or more generically as a running back, lines up behind the quarterback and in many cases behind the fullback, or rarely behind center to receive the snap (see Wildcat formation). A halfback's responsibilities include running the ball, catching passes, blocking, and sometimes even throwing the ball on trick plays. Receivers (Eligible receivers are the ends and the backs, other than an NFL quarterback lined up \\"under center\\". Not all backs fall into the wide receiver category below.) * Wide receiver: Depending on the formation, an offense may have anywhere from zero to five wide receivers (WR). Most basic formations feature either two or three WRs, who either line up on the line of scrimmage (a WR in this position is sometimes referred to as split end) or behind the line of scrimmage (where they are referred to as flankers, wingbacks or slotbacks). WRs are among the fastest and most agile players on the team and their main job is to catch passes and run after the catch. Well- rounded receivers are also effective blockers and, in some cases, can act as running backs on trick plays. * Tight end: The tight end (TE) was traditionally a blocking position but is now considered a combination wide receiver/lineman. TEs normally line up on the line of scrimmage next to the tackles. They are among the most well-rounded athletes on the field as they must be strong enough to run block and pass block as well as agile enough to run pass routes and catch the football. =Offensive formations= Before the ball is snapped the offensive team lines up in a formation. The type of formation used is determined by the game situation. Teams often have \\"special formations\\" that they only use in obvious passing situations, short yardage, goal line situations, or formations they have developed for that particular game just to confuse the defense. There are a nearly unlimited number of possible formations ‚Äì a few of the more common ones are: * Option offense * Pro set * Shotgun formation * Wishbone formation * I formation * Single-wing formation * T formation * Goal line formation * Single set back * Wildcat formation * Pistol formation * Victory formation =Offensive plays= When the team is in formation and the quarterback gives a signal, either by calling out instructions or giving a non-verbal cue (a so-called \\"silent count\\"), the center snaps the ball to the quarterback and a play begins. Running plays A running play occurs when the quarterback hands the ball to another player, who then attempts to carry the ball past the line of scrimmage and gain yards, or the quarterback keeps the ball himself and runs beyond the line of scrimmage. In both cases, the offensive line's main job is to run block, preventing the defensive players from tackling the ball carrier. The choice of running play depends on the strengths of an offensive team, the weaknesses of the defense they are opposing, and the distance needed to score a touchdown or gain a first down. There are many kinds of running plays, including: * Plunge/Dive * Sweep * Reverse * Off Tackle * Student Body Right * Draw * Counter Trey * Quarterback sneak * QB sweep * Bootleg * Option * Counter * Power * Zone * Trap run Passing plays When a passing play occurs, the backs and receivers run specific patterns, or routes, and the quarterback throws the ball to one of the players. On these plays, the offensive line's main job is to prevent defensive players from tackling the quarterback before he throws the ball (a \\"sack\\") or disrupting the quarterback in any other way during the play. When successful, passing plays tend to cover more ground than running plays, so they are often used when the offensive team needs to gain a large number of yards, Even if they do not need to gain a large number of yards, it would be foolish to keep doing run plays because the defense could predict it. However, run plays are used to tire the defensive linemen in between passing plays in order to protect the QB from sacks. These are curl routes. These are corner routes. Different kinds of pass plays include: * Fly route * Slant route * Out route * Screen pass * Button hook * Corner Route * Hail Mary * Seam route =Eligible receivers= One general rule teams must take into account when creating their passing strategy is that only certain players are allowed to catch forward passes. If a player who is not an eligible receiver receives a thrown pass, the team could be penalized. However, if prior to a play the team reports to the referee that a normally ineligible receiver will act as an eligible receiver for one play, that player is allowed to catch passes. Teams will use this strategy from time to time to confuse the defense or force them to devote more attention to possible pass catchers. =Specific offensive strategies= Using a combination of passing plays and running plays, the offense tries to gain the yards needed for a first down, touchdown, or field goal. Over the years several football coaches and offensive coordinators have developed some well-known and widely used offensive strategies: * Option offense * Run and shoot offense * Smashmouth offense * Air Coryell * Spread offense * West Coast offense * Pistol offense * Pro-style offense * Marty ball =Play calling systems= Distinct from the offensive strategies or philosophies, which govern how a team moves the ball down the field, whether a team relies on downfield passes, short passes, inside runs, etc. are the ways in which plays are called. These play calling systems often developed alongside certain offensive strategies, though the systems themselves can work with any strategy. The differences between the systems focus on the specific language used to communicate plays to players. In the NFL, three basic systems predominate: * The West Coast system, which developed alongside the West Coast offense, uses specific words to describe formations, blocking schemes, and the routes that runners or pass receivers run. A typical play name would read \\"FB West Right Slot 372 Y Stick\\": FB West Right Slot describes the formation, 372 describes the blocking scheme, while Y Stick describes the route run by the primary receiver (Y receiver or tight end). * The Coryell system, which developed alongside the Air Coryell offense, is based on a numerical code known as a \\"route tree\\". Play calling uses a three digit number, for example 896, where each digit tells a specific receiver which route to run: The leftmost receiver runs an \\"8\\" or post route, the middle receiver runs a \\"9\\" or go route, and the rightmost receiver runs a \\"6\\" or in route. * The Erhardt‚ÄìPerkins system, developed in the 1970s by two assistant coaches with the New England Patriots, is based on single word concepts rather than assigning each player a role in the play. One word, say \\"ghost\\", tells each receiver what to do; the concept is divorced from the formation, so regardless of the formation, each player, based on where he is lined up, runs the proper pattern determined by the \\"ghost\\" concept. This places a heavy emphasis on memorization (as every player needs to know every route in every concept, not just specific routes to run on specific plays), but also allows for more efficient communication (one word does the job of complex sentences of coded words and numbers) and allows for a greater flexibility by allowing every play to be run from every possible formation. Defensive strategy The goal of defensive strategy is to prevent the opposing offense from gaining yards and scoring points, either by preventing the offense from advancing the ball beyond the line of scrimmage or by the defense taking the ball away from the offense (referred to as a turnover) and scoring points themselves. =Defensive players= On defense, there are three types of players: linemen, linebackers, and defensive backs (also called secondary players). These players' specific positions on the field and duties during the game vary depending on the type of defense being used as well as the kind of offense the defense is facing. Defensive line The defensive line lines up in front of the offensive line. The defensive lineman's responsibility is to prevent the offensive line from opening up running lanes for the running back or to sack the quarterback, depending on whether the play is a passing or running play. Most of the time, defensive linemen attack the offensive line but in some plays they drop back in pass coverage to confuse the opposite team. * Defensive nose guard: The nose guard (\\"NG\\"), also known as a nose tackle (\\"NT\\"), lines up across from the center. Nose guards are among the biggest players on the field and mainly are used to push back the center or the guard to stop a running play or to move the offensive linemen to where the linebackers can rush the quarterback. * Defensive tackle: The defensive tackle (\\"DT\\") lines up against the guard or center on the offensive line. Defensive tackles are generally the biggest and most powerful players on defense; many of them are of the same size as the offensive line. They tend to be more the \\"run-stopping\\" type rather than being good at rushing the quarterback themselves. * Defensive end: Defensive ends (\\"DE\\") line up just outside the offensive tackle. Defensive ends need to be strong to be able to not be pushed back by the offensive line, yet fast enough to run around the offensive tackle. There are different types of defensive ends; some are about as strong as DTs and are considered more adept at stopping the run, while others are fast and agile, and are much better at rushing the quarterback than stopping the run. Linebackers Linebackers stand behind the defensive linemen or set themselves up on the line of scrimmage. Depending on the type of defensive strategy being used, a linebacker's responsibilities can include helping to stop the run, rushing the quarterback, or dropping back in pass protection. * Outside linebackers: The outside linebackers (\\"OLB\\") set up on the outside portion of the line of scrimmage. They are often used to rush the quarterback. OLBs tend to be the fastest and most agile linebackers on the defense. * Inside linebackers: Inside linebackers (\\"ILB\\"), sometimes also referred to as middle linebackers (\\"MLB\\") set up on the inside portion of the line of scrimmage. ILBs tend to be the biggest and strongest linebackers on the defense. Defensive backs Defensive backs stand behind the linebackers. Their primary responsibility is pass coverage, although they can also be involved in stopping the run or rushing the quarterback. * Cornerback: The cornerback (\\"CB\\") lines up opposite the opposing offense's wide receiver(s). Their main job is to cover wide receivers and prevent them from catching passes, or tackle them if they do. * Safety: A defense's safeties (\\"S\\") are usually the farthest away from the line of scrimmage when the play starts. Their job is to help the cornerbacks cover receivers and, if necessary, help the defensive line and linebackers protect against the run. Because of this \\"do everything\\" role, most safeties are the best all-around athletes on the defense. Safeties are designated as strong safeties (\\"SS\\") or free safeties (\\"FS\\"). The strong safety typically plays closer to the line, matches up against tight ends, and is more involved in the run, while the free safety typically is farther from the line and plays more of a \\"last line of defense\\" role in both the pass and run game.Error Page =Defensive formations= In special situations, extra defensive backs enter in \\"nickel\\" (pictured) or \\"dime\\" packages to cover additional receivers. The most common way to describe a basic defensive formation is by stating the number of linemen involved followed by the number of linebackers. The number of defensive backs is usually not mentioned, though if it is, (such as in the \\"3‚Äì3‚Äì5\\"), the number typically appears after the number of linebackers, thus the formula would go (# of linemen)‚Äì(# of linebackers)‚Äì(# of defensive backs [if stated]) in these situations. This naming rule does not always apply when the personnel for a certain formation are lined up in a way that changes the function of the players in the defense. A good example to help explain this would be the \\"3‚Äì5‚Äì3,\\" which actually uses the 3‚Äì3‚Äì5 personnel, but has the five defensive backs arranged with \\"3 deep\\", thus grouping the other two defensive backs with the linebacker group. By far the most common alignments are four down linemen and three linebackers (a \\"4‚Äì3\\" defense), or three down linemen and four linebackers (\\"3‚Äì4\\"), but other formations such as five linemen and two linebackers (\\"5‚Äì2\\"), or three linemen, three linebackers, and five defensive backs (\\"3‚Äì3‚Äì5\\") are also used by a number of teams. On plays where the defense expects the offense to pass, naming emphasis is often placed on the number of defensive backs. In a basic 4‚Äì3 or 3‚Äì4 defense, there are four defensive backs on the field (2 cornerbacks [CB], 1 strong safety [SS], and 1 free safety [FS]). When one of the linemen or linebackers is removed and an additional defensive back is added, common alignments of these five defensive back packages are the \\"nickel\\" package, which includes 3 CB, 1 SS, and 1 FS, and the \\"3‚Äì3‚Äì5,\\" which is a nickel package variant that includes either 2 CB, 2 SS, and 1 FS, or 3 CB, 1 SS, and 1 FS like the standard nickel package. When a sixth defensive back is inserted, it is known as a \\"dime\\" package (4CB, 1SS, 1FS). In rare instances when a seventh defensive back is inserted, it is known as a \\"quarter\\" package (5CB, 1SS, 1FS or 4CB, 2SS, 1FS). As with offensive formations, there are many combinations that can be used to set up a defense. Unusual defensive alignments are constantly used in an effort to neutralize a given offense's strengths. In winning Super Bowl XXV, the New York Giants played with two down linemen, four linebackers and five defensive backs, a strategy that prevented their opponents, the Buffalo Bills, a team with a strong passing game, from completing long passes. In a 2004 game, the New England Patriots used no down linemen and seven linebackers for two plays against the Miami Dolphins. Some of the more familiar defensive formations include: * 4‚Äì3 * 3‚Äì4 * 5‚Äì2 * 4‚Äì4 * 3‚Äì3‚Äì5 * 46 defense * Nickel * Dime * Quarter or Prevent * Eight-in-the-box defense =Defensive plays= The defense must wait until the ball is snapped by the opposing center before they can move across the line of scrimmage or otherwise engage any of the offensive players. Once an opposing offense has broken their huddle and lined up in their formation, defensive players often call out instructions to each other to make last-second adjustments to the defense. Run defense To prevent the opposing offense from gaining yards on the ground, a defense might put more emphasis on their run defense. This generally involves placing more players close to the line of scrimmage to get to the ball carrier more quickly. This strategy is often used when the opposing offense only needs to gain a few yards to make a first down or score a touchdown. Pass defense When the defense believes the opposing offense will pass the ball, they go into pass defense. There are two general schemes for defending against the pass: * Man-to-man, where each eligible receiver is covered by a defensive back or a linebacker. * Zone, where certain players (usually defensive backs or linebackers, though occasionally linemen as well) are assigned an area on the field that they are to cover. Blitz There are times when a defense believes that the best way to stop the offense is to rush the quarterback, which involves sending several players charging at the line of scrimmage in an attempt to tackle the quarterback before he can throw the ball or hand it to another player. Any player on the defense is allowed to rush the quarterback, and many schemes have been developed over 50 years that involve complicated or unusual blitz \\"packages\\". =Specific defensive strategies= Defensive strategies differ somewhat from offensive strategies in that, unlike offenses that have very specific, detailed plans and assignments for each player, defenses are more reactive, with each player's general goal being to \\"stop the offense\\" by tackling the ball carrier, breaking up passing plays, taking the ball away from the offense, or sacking the quarterback. Whereas precision and timing are among the most important parts of offensive strategy, defensive strategies often emphasize aggressiveness and the ability to react to plays as they develop. Nevertheless, there are many defensive strategies that have been developed over the years that coaches use as a framework for their general defense, making specific adjustments depending on the capabilities of their players and the opponent they are facing. Some of the most commonly known and used defensive strategies include: * Man-to-man * Coverage shells (cover 2, cover 3, etc.) * Zone blitz * Tampa 2 * 46 defense * 5‚Äì5‚Äì1 Two-level defense Special teams strategy A special team is the group of players who take the field during kickoffs, free kicks, punts, and field goal attempts. Most football teams' special teams include one or more kickers, a long snapper (who specializes in accurate snaps over long distances), kick returners who catch and carry the ball after it is kicked by the opposing team, and blockers who defend during kicks and returns. Most special teams are made up of players who act as backups or substitutes on the team's offensive and defensive units. Because of the risk of injury, it is uncommon for a starting offensive or defensive player to also play on a special teams unit. A variety of strategic plays can be attempted during kickoffs, punts, and field goals‚Äîto surprise the opposition and score points, gain yardage or first downs, or recover possession of the kicked ball. =Kickoffs= A kickoff occurs at the beginning of each half, overtime period (not in college), and following each touchdown, successful field goal, or safety. Strategically, the coach of the other team may choose to have his players kick the ball in one of several ways: * Standard kickoff: The kicker attempts a high kick meant to travel the greatest possible distance upfield. The kicking team's primary goal is to stop the opposing team's returner as close as possible to the end zone, thus forcing that team to advance the ball a longer distance to score. * Onside kick: This is a very short kick with the goal of the kicking team recovering possession after kicking the ball ten or more yards, usually attempted in the closing minutes of play when a team needs to score again quickly to have a chance of winning. * \\"Squib kick\\" or \\"pooch kick\\": The squib kick is a low kick that may hit the ground and bounce in a random fashion, making it less predictable. A squib kick is generally used when trying to avoid a run-back, although this outcome is not guaranteed. A pooch kick is used for a similar purpose, except is a short, high kick that the kickoff team can get to before there is a return. Because the kick does not travel nearly as far as a standard kickoff, this strategy gives the opposing team better average field position, but the advantage is that a long kick return is less likely. * Kickoff out of bounds: If a kickoff travels over the sidelines either in the air, or bounces in the field of play, then rolls out of bounds without being touched by a player on the receiving team, the play results in an illegal procedure penalty. The ball is then spotted 30 yards from the spot of the kick or at the out-of-bounds, resulting in a first down (and beginning of offensive series) for the receiving team. Sometimes, although very rarely, the kicking team purposely kicks the ball out of bounds if they're facing an excellent kick returner. =Punts= * Standard punts: punts on fourth down when the chances of gaining enough yards for a first down are slim and when the ball is too far from the goalpost to allow a field goal try. Generally, a member of the opposing team moves into position to catch the ball. He may try to gain yards by running the ball downfield, or he may signal a fair catch by waving one arm above his head, thus signaling that he won't try to return the ball downfield. A player who has signaled a fair catch may not be tackled after catching the ball, or the player who tackled him is penalized for kick- catching interference. * Pooch punts: Occasionally, a coach lines his team up in a shotgun formation and has the quarterback \\"quick kick\\", or \\"pooch punt\\", to use the element of surprise to cause the defense not to have a receiver ready. Some teams even do this from a field goal formation, having the ball snapped directly to the placekicker who punts the ball downfield instead of trying a field goal that has a low chance for success. * Fake punts: In much the same way as a fake field goal (described below), a fake punt is an effort to trick the opposition and either score or gain enough yards for a first down. Fake punts are risky for the same reasons as fake field goals and are thus rarely attempted. * Punts out of bounds: Skilled punters may try to punt a ball past the return team so that the ball touches the playing field in bounds, then rolls out of bounds close to the opposing team's end zone. The drawback to such a punt is that the ball may roll into the end zone (touchback), giving the receiving team normal starting position. Or, if the kick is angled too sharply, it goes out of bounds too early and results in an unusually short, or botched, punt. The best punters are highly regarded for their ability to put the ball out of bounds within five yards of the goal line. These punts are also known as a \\"coffin corner punt\\" due to their ability to pin an opposing offense inside its own five-yard line, thus increasing the chances for the opposing defense to score a safety or a defensive touchdown. * Onside punts: In a few leagues, onside punting is legal. As of 2017, the Canadian Football League is the only professional league to allow it. The XFL allowed onside punting if the ball went 25 yards or more. It can be used as a surprise tactic or a method of covering distances that a regular play could not. * Field goal attempts: In high school football, a field goal attempt is considered a regular punt if the attempt is no good. Thus, kicking from a field goal formation can possibly offer the chance of a punt without the opposing team having a return man. The \\"no punting\\" strategy is one that forsakes the practice of punting and instead attempts to make fourth down conversions on as many plays as possible. It has been implemented at Pulaski Academy, a top-ranked prep school, and has been advocated by Gregg Easterbrook in his Tuesday Morning Quarterback column and by author Jon Wertheim. Fourth down decisions to punt have been analyzed mathematically by David Romer. =Field goals= Field goals are worth one point after a scored touchdown, or three points in the event that a team does not score a touchdown but feels it is positioned close enough for the kicker to make the attempt. * Standard field goals: The strategy for a field goal is fairly straightforward. The team on offense forms a protective semicircle behind the line of scrimmage on either side of the center, who snaps the ball to the holder. The holder positions the ball so that the kicker ‚Äì moving from a short distance away ‚Äì can quickly get into position and accurately kick the ball through the goalposts. The remaining players block the opposing team, whose members try to break through the protective circle to block the kick or bat it aside for a chance to intercept the ball. If a team misses the field goal, the opposing team takes possession of the ball from the spot where the ball was kicked, as opposed to the line of scrimmage. Several factors, including distance, weather, crowd noise, and a kicker's leg strength and experience determine the success or failure of a field goal attempt. * Fake field goals: In some situations, a coach may choose to have his team fake a field goal attempt. The players line up as normal, but instead of holding the ball for a kick, the player receiving the snap may run with the ball, hand it off to another player, or attempt to throw it downfield. * Field goal returns: It is possible for the defensive team to return a missed field goal. If a field goal attempt is short of the goal posts a player may return the ball just as on a punt. Teams usually try a return only when a very long field goal is attempted at the end of the first half or in the closing seconds of a tied game, since in all other cases it is more advantageous for the defense to just let the ball fall short. =Kick and punt returns= * Standard returns: The biggest choice facing a kick returner is whether to attempt to run the ball back. Generally, a returner who catches a kickoff or punt in the \\"red zone\\" between the receiving team's own end zone and 20-yard line attempts some sort of return, if only to gain a few yards. If the receiving team's players can get into position quickly, they may be able to allow the returner to gain further yardage, or break away from the pack entirely and score a touchdown. * Laterals: In extreme cases‚Äîgenerally during kickoff returns in the closing seconds of play‚Äîthe returner may attempt a lateral pass to avoid the ball being downed in a tackle. The return team may throw as many lateral passes as they choose, and this is normally done in a desperate attempt to keep the ball alive. This notably occurred on January 8, 2000, during a wildcard game between the Tennessee Titans and Buffalo Bills, in a play known as the Music City Miracle. In the game's final seconds, Lorenzo Neal, Frank Wycheck and Kevin Dyson combined on a 75-yard kickoff return touchdown to give the Titans a 22‚Äì16 lead (after the extra point), allowing Tennessee to advance to the second round of the playoffs. Another well-known occurrence is an occasion during an NCAA game regarded as \\"The Play\\" in which the University of California return team completed five lateral passes for a successful return and a come-from-behind victory. * Fair catches: A kick returner may signal a fair catch if the ball will be caught with good field position, or if the kicking team's members are advancing so quickly that a return is impossible. However, he is penalized if he attempts a return after signaling a fair catch; likewise, players who tackle a returner who has signaled a fair catch are penalized. If a player waves for a fair catch and then fails to touch the ball, it may be downed as normal by the kicking team, but if recovered by the receiving team, may not be advanced. However, if any member of the receiving team catches a ball and then drops it, it becomes a live ball and may be recovered by either side. * \\"Live balls\\" and \\"Dead balls\\": If a punted ball is touched after passing the line of scrimmage, even inadvertently, by a member of the receiving team it becomes a live ball and may be recovered as if a fumble by the kicking team. Conversely if the receiving team doesn't touch the ball and a member of the kicking team touches it, the ball is ruled down where it is touched and play is dead. All place-kicked balls‚Äîkick-offs, field goal attempts, and the like‚Äîare live balls, which may be played in one way or another by either team (subject to restrictions in the case of any \\"free\\" kick: see onside kick). Downing the ball If, the receiving team does not catch the ball, the kicking team may move into position and try to down it as close as possible to the opposing team's end zone. This is achieved by either catching the ball (generally when close to the end zone so as to prevent a touchback), or surrounding the ball and allowing it to roll or bounce, without touching it, as close as possible to the end zone. If the ball appears to be rolling or bouncing into the end zone, a player may run in front of the goal line and attempt to bat it down or catch it. If a member of the kicking team catches the ball before a member of the receiving team does so, the play is blown dead by the official, and the receiving team takes possession at the spot the ball was spotted by the official. Thus it is strategically important for kicking teams to get as close to the ball as possible after a punt, so that they may quickly tackle a returner, down the ball as close to the opposing team's end zone as possible, and (if possible) recover the ball after a fumble and regain possession of the ball.

Along with \\"The Overcoat\\" and \\"The Nose\\", \\"Diary of a Madman\\" is considered to be one of Gogol's greatest short stories. The tale centers on the life of a minor civil servant during the repressive era of Nicholas I. Following the format of a diary, the story shows the descent of the protagonist, Poprishchin, into insanity. \\"Diary of a Madman\\", the only one of Gogol's works written in first person, follows diary-entry format. Plot summary Poprishchin. Painting by Ilya Repin (1882) The story centers on Aksenty Ivanovich Poprishchin, a low- ranking civil servant (titular counsellor), constantly belittled and criticized for underachieving. He yearns to be noticed by a beautiful woman, Sophie, the daughter of his boss, with whom he has fallen in love. As he said in his first sight of her, just after being a beast of a civil servant himself, ‚ÄúA footman opened the carriage door and out she fluttered, just like a little bird.‚Äù Nothing comes of this love he feels for her; Sophie is effectively unaware of him. His diary records his gradual slide into insanity. As his madness deepens, he begins to \\"understand\\" the conversations of two dogs and believes he has discovered letters sent between them. The style of the letters, including what Poprishchin terms ‚Äúdogginess‚Äù and ‚Äúcanine nature‚Äù, convince him of the letters' authenticity. The letters provide Poprishchin with a much more in-depth view of Sophie's life, including her engagement to another man. In ‚ÄúThe Year 2000, 43rd of April‚Äù, it is made clear that Poprishchin has now gone mad. This diary entry is the first of many which he has lost the ability to distinguish a true sense of time. He begins to believe himself to be the heir to the throne of Spain. He decides to make a Spanish royal uniform so that the common people will recognize him. Believing himself in Spain, waiting for the Spanish deputies to arrive, he then decides that Spain and China are in fact the same country. This trip is actually an appearance of his imagination that has been translated from being maltreated in an insane asylum. Themes =Descent into madness= In the realm of the method of Gogol's madness, the only possible approach that can direct the reader to contextualize and reflect on such a subject that lies beyond reason is to follow in the path of madness and allow ourselves to be misled. Poprishchin's descent into madness spawns from his outlook on society. Poprishchin is unhappy with every aspect of his life and is envious of anyone who he believes has it better than he, which is essentially everyone. His desire to achieve the dignity and authority that he sees around him, but never feels, yields frustration rather than motivation. His lack of motivation causes Poprishchin to wish for power and wealth, instead of actively trying to work toward this achieving this goal in reality. Poprishchin's relationship with three specific characters, the Director, the Section Chief and Sofi, contribute significantly to the downfall of his sanity. The Section Chief causes Poprishchin the most direct frustration through constant, yet legitimate criticism. Poprishchin responds to the Section Chief's behavior with anger and aggression for trying to bring him into reality. The Director takes a much more passive role in affecting Poprishchin. Poprishchin actually idolizes the Director, a large part due to the fact that he remains distant from Poprishchin and never interferes in his personal life with comments or suggestions. Despite this initially peaceful relationship, Poprishchin finds a way to see a menace in the Director, mainly out of envy. Poprishchin notices that the Director has too much ambition, a quality that Poprishchin desires, but knows he cannot achieve in reality, and therefore turns his admiration of the Director into hatred. Sofi is a beautiful woman to whom Poprishchin has a strong sexual attraction. However, Poprishchin painfully discovers that Sofi finds him unattractive and irritable, and he is unable to cope. Poprishchin is enlightened about both the Director's ambition and Sofi's view of him from letters written by a dog. Poprishchin's imagination conjured the complimentary letter from Sofi, when, in reality, the letter neglects mentioning him. His destruction of the letter evidences his insanity by symbolizing his release of reality. =Alienation= One disruptive force contextualized is the relationship between the individual and society. As we allow Poprishchin to mislead us in his madness, we gain insight on the theme of alienation. His struggle allows us to contextualize his alienation from society through a lens set in the time and place of Diary of a Madman, but also to compare and contrast it with a more general sense of any alienation from society. Poprishchin's alienation from society is strongly rooted to the way he perceives and treats people around him. Poprishchin sees a menace in everyone and always finds a way to blame others for his personal frustrations, and consequently treats them with the aggression he believes they deserve. This behavior fuels a vicious cycle that justifies the negative perception and treatment that the real world exerts toward Poprishchin. =Public and private identity= The many illusions Poprishchin creates for his false reality are intended to improve either his public identity or his private identity. Power and dignity are the two most significant traits that Poprishchin fantasizes about. We see many attempts by Poprishchin to increase his power in his newspaper world by acquiring political rank, giving himself dominance relative to the general public and ultimately improving his public identity. This side of his fantasy is fueled by his desire of approval from others, a feat he can obviously not achieve in reality. Attempts to improve his private identity are synonymous with gaining dignity and self-respect - Poprishchin's erotic fantasies are the primary result of this quest. Poprishchin does not feel love, but rather his feelings of humiliation and the need to assert himself serve as the main driver for his erotic fantasies. =Numbers= There have been many professional analyses on Poprishchin's unique diary entries attempting to interpret their meaning, with special interest taken to the entry: 43 April 2000. A Freudian analysis performed by Professor Ermakov deducted that Poprishchin used this absurd date to avoid May 13, because the word maja suggests majat‚Äôsja, which in Russian means suffering. Richard Gustafson's analysis of the entry title is more grounded in the contents of the story. He agrees that Poprishchin is indeed trying to avoid May 13, but his reasoning for such is that the letters from the dogs that exposed the grave reality of Sofi and the Director were presented exactly half a year earlier on November 13. . Adaptations In 1958, Humphrey Searle set the story as an opera of the same name; a BBC recording of the first English production in 1960 was awarded the Radio Critic's prize at UNESCO's International Rostrum of Composers in that year. In 1963 Richard Williams began an animated version of the story, but the project was left unfinished. The narration by Kenneth Williams was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in 1991 and included in a 3-hour special entitled Williams on the Wireless on BBC Radio 4 Extra. In 1964, The Black Mass radio series broadcast a half-hour adaptation starring Erik Bauersfeld (who also produced and edited the series) as Poprishchin. In 1968 Alexander Belinsky directed a TV adaptation of the story for the Leningrad TV, starring Yevgeni Lebedev as Poprishchin. Both the director and the actor were critically praised, calling Lebedev's acting \\"unforgettable\\". The story saw two opera adaptations: as a \\"monoopera\\" in 1964 by Youri Boutsko, a Soviet composer from Ukraine, which was filmed for television in 1980 with Vladimir Urbanovich playing Poprischin, and in 1974 by Stanojlo Rajiƒçiƒá, a Yugoslavian composer (presented as TV opera in 1977). The BBC Radio 4 comedy series Three Ivans, Two Aunts and an Overcoat broadcast an adaptation of the story starring Griff Rhys Jones as Poprishchin in May 2002.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p2hb2 The short story has been adapted for the stage by David Holman, Geoffrey Rush and Neil Armfield for the Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney, Australia, and this production has also been presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the United StatesBrooklyn Academy of Music and at the Quintessence Theater Group in Philadelphia PA. A translated audio book version of the short story was published in Malayalam in 2017 by Kathacafe https://www.kathacafe.com/collections/fantasy/products/diary-of-a- madman Influences Lu Xun, the pioneer of modern Chinese prose, read widely in Russian literature and was inspired by this story to create his own in 1918. While Lu Xun borrows the Chinese translation of the title of Gogol's story, to avoid confusion, the English title of Lu Xun's version is usually translated as A Madman's Diary. The story's name was reflected in the name Lina Kostenko's novel Notes of a Ukrainian Madman, which much refers to Gogol's writings.

Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner & Co. p. 192. These senses of the term entered Hiberno-English from Scots through Ulster at some point in the mid-20th century and were then borrowed into Irish. The Dictionary of the Scots Language records use of the term in Ulster in 1929. Other early Irish citations from the Irish Independent relate to rural Ulster: from 1950, \\"There was much good 'crack'... in the edition of Country Magazine which covered Northern Ireland\\"; or from 1955, \\"The Duke had been sitting on top of Kelly's gate watching the crack.\\" At this time the word was, in Ireland, associated with Ulster dialects: in 1964 linguist John Braidwood said of the term, \\"perhaps one of the most seemingly native Ulster words is crack.... In fact the word is of English and Scots origin.\\"Braidwood, John, ‚ÄúUlster and Elizabethan English‚Äù in Ulster Dialects: An Introductory Symposium (1964) Ulster Folk Museum, p. 99. It can frequently be found in the work of 20th century Ulster writers such as Jennifer Johnston (1977): \\"I'm sorry if I muscled in on Saturday. Did I spoil your crack?\\"Jennifer Johnston: Shadows on Our Skin and Brian Friel (1980): \\"You never saw such crack in your life, boys\\".Brian Friel: Translations Crack was borrowed into the Irish language with the Gaelicized spelling craic. It has been used in Irish since at least 1968,See, for example, this newspaper advertisement: and was popularised in the catchphrase Beidh ceol, caint agus craic againn (\\"We'll have music, chat and craic\\"), used by Se√°n B√°n Breathnach for his Irish-language chatshow SBB ina Shu√≠, broadcast on RT√â from 1976 to 1982. The Irish spelling was soon reborrowed into English, and is attested in publications from the 1970s and 1980s. Craic has also been used in Scottish Gaelic since at least the early 1990s, though it is unknown if it was borrowed directly from Irish or from English. At first the craic form was uncommon outside Irish, even in an Irish context. Barney Rush's 1960s song \\"The Crack Was Ninety in the Isle of Man\\" does not use the Irish-language spelling, neither is it used in Christy Moore's 1978 version. However, The Dubliners' 2006 version adopts the Irish spelling. The title of Four to the Bar's 1994 concert album, Craic on the Road, uses the Irish-language spelling as an English-language pun,Four to the Bar: Craic on the Road as does Irish comedian Dara √ì Briain's 2012 show Craic Dealer. Now, 'craic' is interpreted as a specifically and quintessentially Irish form of fun. The adoption of the Gaelic spelling has reinforced the sense that this is an independent word (homophone) rather than a separate sense of the original word (polysemy). Frank McNally of The Irish Times has said of the word, \\"[m]ost Irish people now have no idea it's foreign.\\" Criticism of spelling The craic spelling has attracted criticism when used in English. English-language specialist Diarmaid √ì Muirithe wrote in his Irish Times column \\"The Words We Use\\" that \\"the constant Gaelicisation of the good old English-Scottish dialect word crack as craic sets my teeth on edge\\".; reprinted in Writing for the Irish Independent, Irish journalist Kevin Myers criticised the craic spelling as \\"pseudo-Gaelic\\" and a \\"bogus neologism\\". Other linguists have referred to the craic form as \\"fake Irish\\".Momma, Haruko, Matto, Michael (2009). A Companion to the History of the English Language. John Wiley & Sons Inc. p. 371. Sociology \\"The craic\\" has become a part of Irish culture. In a 2001 review of the modern Irish information economy, information sciences professor Eileen M. Trauth called \\"craic\\" an intrinsic part of the culture of sociability that distinguished the Irish workplace from those of other countries.Trauth, p. 147. Trauth wrote that even as Ireland transitioned away from an economy and society dominated by agriculture, the traditional importance of atmosphere and the art of conversation ‚Äì \\"craic\\" ‚Äì remains, and that the social life is a fundamental part of workers' judgment of quality of life.Trauth, pp. 149‚Äì150. Critics have accused the Irish tourism industry and the promoters of Irish theme pubs of marketing \\"commodified craic\\" as a kind of stereotypical Irishness.McGovern 2002, p. 91 In his Companion to Irish Traditional Music, Fintan Vallely suggests that use of craic in English is largely an exercise on the part of Irish pubs to make money through the commercialisation of traditional Irish music. Likewise, Donald Clarke in The Irish Times associates the change of spelling to craic with the rebranding of the Irish pub as a tourist attraction during the 1990s.

The massive rectangular building with four corner towers stands on an isolated rocky hill of the Little Carpathians directly above the Danube river in the middle of Bratislava. Because of its size and location, it has been a dominant feature of the city for centuries. The location provides excellent views of Bratislava, Austria and, in clear weather, parts of Hungary. Many legends are connected with the history of the castle. The castle site The following are at the castle site: =Castle building (The Palace)= The castle building includes four towers (one on each corner) and a courtyard with a deep water well. The largest and tallest tower is the Crown Tower on the southwest corner. The tower dates from the 13th century and for approximately 200 years beginning in the mid-1500s housed the crown jewels of Hungary. The exterior walls and inside corridors contain fragments of old Gothic and Renaissance construction elements. The walled-up entrance gate from the 16th century is still visible to the east of the main hall/entrance. Behind the entrance, is an arcade corridor leading to a large Baroque staircase which, in turn, leads to the exhibitions of the Slovak National Museum on the second floor. The west wing of this floor houses the 4 halls of the Treasure Chamber (opened in 1988) with a collection of the most precious archaeological finds and other objects of Slovakia, including the prehistoric statue called the Venus of Moravany. The third floor houses the exhibition on the History of Slovakia. The first floor in the south wing of the building houses the rooms of Slovak parliament ‚Äî the National Council of the Slovak Republic - including furnishings from the 16th century. The northern wing of the building- the former Baroque chapel, houses the Music Hall in which concerts are held. The courtyard includes the entrance to the Knights Hall. =Entrance gates= Sigismund Gate * Sigismund Gate in the southeast‚Äì the best preserved original part of the site, built in the 15th century * Vienna Gate in the southwest ‚Äì built in 1712 * Nicholas Gate in the northeast ‚Äì built in the 16th century * Leopold Gate =Other buildings= To the west of the main building, is the newly reconstructed Hillebrandt building which dates from 1762 and was destroyed by the 1811 fire. The Yard of Honor is the space directly before the castle entrance dates from the late 18th century. Inside the Sigismund Gate and below the Court of Honor, is the Leopold Yard with bastions, constructed in the 17th century. To the east of the castle building the constellation of the Great Moravian basilica (9th century), the Church of St Savior (11th century) and other Early medieval objects is indicated on the ground. The true archaeological findings are directly below this indicated constellation. Adjacent to the Nicholas Gate, a Gothic gateway from the 15th century in the northeast quadrant, is the Lugiland Bastion. This is a long three-floor building from the 17th century which currently houses the National Council of the Slovak Republic, and a Baroque stable (today a famous restaurant). An English landscape garden is located to the south of the stable. The northern border of the site is formed by a long Baroque building from the 18th century, which today houses the Slovak National Museum and the castle administration. History =Prehistory (2800 ‚Äì 450 BC)= The castle's site, like today's city, has been inhabited for thousands of years, because it is strategically located in the center of Europe at a passage between the Carpathians and the Alps, at an important ford used to cross the Danube river, and at an important crossing of central European ancient (trade) routes running from the Balkans or the Adriatic Sea to the Rhine river or the Baltic Sea, the most important route being the Amber Route. The people of the Boler√°z culture (the oldest phase of the Baden culture) were the first known culture to have constructed settlements on the castle hill. This happened around 3500 BC (i.e. in the high Eneolithic Period). Their \\"castle\\" was a fortified settlement and a kind of acropolis for settlements in today's Old Town of Bratislava. Further major findings from the castle hill are from the Hallstatt Period (Early Iron Age, 750 ‚Äì 450 BC). At that time the people of the Kalenderberg Culture constructed a building plunged into the rock of the castle hill. Again, the \\"castle\\" served as an acropolis for settlements found in the western part of the Old Town. =Celts and Romans (450 BC ‚Äì 5th Century AD)= During the La T√®ne Period (Late Iron Age, Celtic Period, 450 BC ‚Äì 1 BC ), the castle hill became a very important center of the Celts. In the last century BC (after 125 BC), the \\"castle\\" served as the acropolis of an oppidum (town) of the Celtic Boii. A great number and diversity of findings (including coins, house equipment, two Roman buildings, castle entrance gate etc.) testifies this. The castle hill, which was situated at the Danube and thus since 9 BC at the border of the Roman Empire, was also settled by the Romans during the Roman Period (1st to 4th century AD) as findings of bricks of Roman legions (Legion XIII GAN, Legion X GEPF etc.) and some parts of architecture (a Roman figural relief, roof parts etc.) suggest. The developments in the 5th century (the time of the Great Migration of Peoples) are largely unclear. =Slavs, Nitrian Principality, Great Moravia (500 ‚Äì 907)= The situation changed with the arrival of the Slavs in the territory of Bratislava. Initially, they partly used older Roman and Celtic structures and added some fortifications. Probably at the end of the 8th century (definitely not later than in the early 9th century), at the time of the Principality of Nitra, a Slavic castle with a wooden rampart was constructed with a huge area of 55,000 square metres. In the second half of the 9th century, at the time of Great Moravia, a palace of stone surrounded by dwellings and a big basilica were added. The basilica is the largest Great Moravian basilica from the territory of Slovakia, and the area of the castle is approximately the same as that of the Mikulƒçice site (the historical town \\"Moravia\\"), which is the most important Great Moravian archaeological site. Great Moravian basilica at the Bratislava castleMaterial from old Roman buildings was used to construct this Slavic castle in Bratislava. This could be a confirmation of the disputed statement of Aventinus from the 16th century, who ‚Äì referring to lost sources ‚Äì claimed that around 805/7 the Great Moravian prince Uratislaus (i.e. Vratislav) constructed today's Bratislava (Castle?) at the place of a destroyed Roman frontier fort called Pisonium, and the new settlement was named after him Uratislaburgium / Wratisslaburgium. Another probable fact is that around 900 the castle and the territory it controlled was given in fief to Predslav the third son of the Great Moravian king Sv√§topluk and that Pre(d) slav, or a person of the same name, is the person after which the castle and the town received its old German name Pressburg (from which the old Slovak name Pre≈°porek is derived). The oldest version of this name was Preslava (Slovak) / Preslav(a) sburg (German). It appeared for the first time in 907 (Battle of Pressburg) in the forms Brezalauspurc(h), Braslavespurch and Pressalauspruch and then around 1000 on Hungarian coins as Preslav(v) a Civitas (meaning Bratislava Castle). On the other hand, the exact location of Brezalauspurc is still disputed. =High and Late Middle Ages (907 ‚Äì 1531)= Emperor Henry III losing his fleet below Pressburg Castle, 14th-century manuscript The construction of a new castle of stone started in the 10th century, but work lagged. Under King Stephen I of Hungary (1000‚Äì1038), however, the castle was already one of the central castles of the Kingdom of Hungary. It became the seat of Pozsony county and protected the kingdom against Bohemian (Czech) and German attacks (e.g. in 1030, 1042, 1052, 1108, 1146) and played an important role in throne struggles in the Kingdom of Hungary (e.g. struggles after the death of King Stephen I). In 1052 Henry III tried to occupy the castle. According to Hungarian tradition Zothmund a Hungarian soldier, swam to the ships of the invading fleet to drill holes in them, and they were sunk. King Solomon of Hungary had lived here until he was taken to the jail of Nyitra according to Ladislaus I's order. At the same time the old rampart was modernized and the Church of the St. Savior with a chapter and a church school were added. Stephen III of Hungary escaped from his enemies to the castle almost 100 years later. The castle was turned into a proto-Romanesque palace of stone in the 12th century (probably after 1179), maybe because King B√©la III (1173‚Äì1196) decided to make Esztergom the definitive seat of kings of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was a palace similar to those constructed in Germany under Friedrich Barbarossa. In 1182 Friedrich Barbarossa gathered his crusader army under the castle. The church institutions and building at the castle were moved to the town below the castle in the early 12th century. The well-fortified Pressburg Castle was among the few castles of the Kingdom of Hungary to be able to withstand Mongol attacks in 1241 and 1242. As a reaction to these attacks, a huge \\"tower for the protection of the kingdom\\" was constructed at the castle building in 1245 immediately next to two older palaces. The tower was actually a huge high residential building. In addition, 7 (genuine) square towers were built into the old rampart and a stone wall was added around the castle proper (i.e. the residential building). The biggest of the rampart towers was at the same time a corner tower of the stone wall. Today it is a part of the castle building ‚Äî it is identical with the present-day \\"Crown tower\\", which is the largest of the four existing towers of the structure. It was probably built around 1250 when Knights of St. John were active at the castle. On 25 October 1265 the Czech King, P≈ôemysl Otakar and the Hungarian King B√©la IV.'s grandchild Kunigunde, were engaged here. Andrew II and Gertrude's daughter, Elisabeth was born here. The new castle faced further conflicts. In 1271, King Otakar II of Bohemia invaded the territory of today's western Slovakia and charged the knight Egid with the administration of the conquered castle. Egid rebelled against Otakar two years later and was defeated by Otakar, but due to problems in Bohemia, Otakar had to leave this territory. In 1285-86, the noble Nicholas K≈ëszegi occupied the castle in order to use it as a basis for a rebellion against the Hungarian king, but he was defeated. Shortly afterwards, 1287‚Äì1291, the Austrian duke Albert of Habsburg, supporting Nicholas, occupied the castle, but was defeated by Matthew III Cs√°k, who was made county head of Pozsony county for this. A more or less successful Austrian occupation of the castle and the county occurred in 1302-1312/1322 by Duke Rudolf. As a result of these permanent fighting, the Hungarian king granted the city rights (town charter) to a part of the settlements below the castle in 1291, thereby withdrawing them from the authority of the county head in the castle. Some settlements on the castle hill remained under the castle's authority and the fortification was gradually extended to them. In 1385, King Sigismund of Luxembourg occupied the castle and Pozsony county and one year later put the county in pawn to his cousins, the Moravian margraves Prokop and Jo≈°t in exchange for a loan they provided to him. The castle was reconquered by Stibor of Stiboricz in 1389, who was made the county head of the Pozsony county in 1389-1402 as a reward. He had a chapel built in Bratislava Castle. The castle and the town of Pressburg on a picture from the 15th century Other allies of King Sigismund, especially in his fights against the Czech Hussites, was the noble family Rozgonyi, which received the Pozsony county head function in 1421. At some point between 1420 and 1430, King Sigismund (Holy Roman Emperor) decided to make Bratislava Castle ‚Äì due to its central location ‚Äî the center of his new German-Czech-Hungarian empire. In 1423, the king ordered the Rozgonyis to improve the fortifications of the castle as a protection against Hussite attacks, because the castle was situated close to the Czech border and it was still protected only by the old wooden ramparts. They replaced the old rampart with a new better stone bulwark. Then between 1431 and 1434 a total rearrangement of Pressburg castle took place. Experts from Germany were invited, material was transported from Austria, towns were imposed special taxes specifically for the construction of the planned largest castle ever built. The construction master was Konrad von Erlingen. The residential \\"tower\\" was demolished, and the form of the new Gothic palace was approximately similar to that of the present-day castle (but without two towers). Today, the only completely preserved part of the castle from that time is the Sigismund Gate (wrongly called the Corvinus Gate), i.e. the eastern entrance gate in the bulwark. Smaller parts have been preserve in the main palace. Sigismund plans, however, did not materialize, because the castle was never made Sigismund's residence and Sigismund always lived in the town below the castle. After Sigismund's death in 1437, his widow Barbara of Celje was imprisoned in the castle by the new king Albert of Habsburg. In 1438, Albert's daughter, Anne was engaged to the margrave William III, Landgrave of Thuringia in the castle. John Hunyadi and his wife Erzs√©bet Szil√°gyi also stayed here and Hungarian women respected them. Later on, Ladislas the Posthumous was probably living in the castle (parts of the castle were adapted for him at least). In 1440-1443, there were fighting between the castle of Pressburg ruled by county heads from the Rozgonyi family (supporting King W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland) and the town of Pressburg (supporting ‚Äì and owned by ‚Äì Queen Elisabeth which ruled for the young Ladislaus Posthumus) ‚Äì see History of Pressburg for details. Castle repairs of 1438, 1452 and 1463 included repairs of damages caused by the above conflict. A water well was constructed in the yard of the castle in the 15th century. =Main castle of the Kingdom of Hungary (1531 ‚Äì 1783)= Political events In 1536 (de facto already in 1531), after the Turks (the Ottoman Empire) had conquered present-day Hungary, Pressburg became the capital (seat of the Diet and of central authorities, place of coronations) of the remaining Kingdom of Hungary, which was renamed Royal Hungary and was ruled by the Austrian Habsburgs now. Consequently, Pressburg Castle became the most important royal castle and the formal seat of the kings of Royal Hungary (who however resided in Vienna normally). At the same time, from the beginning of the 16th century, Pressburg and its castle had to face various anti-Habsburg uprisings in Royal Hungary on the territory of Slovakia. For example, troops of Gabriel Bethlen occupied the castle between 1619 and 1621, when it was reconquered by Habsburg troops, and had the royal crown removed from Pressburg Castle till 1622. Between 1671 and 1677, Pressburg Castle was home to an extraordinary court against the Protestants and participants of anti-Habsburg uprisings. Imre Th√∂k√∂ly, the leader of another big anti-Habsburg uprising, failed to conquer the castle in 1682-83. Holy Crown of Hungary in the crown tower The Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary used to be kept in the Crown Tower of the castle Between 1552 and 1784 the Holy Crown of Hungary stayed in the castle. Two Hungarian crown guards, 50 Hungarian and 50 Austrian infantry soldiers cared for it. Hungarian Kings who derived from foreign dynasties as Habsburgs could not possess it, and only had access to the crown during their coronation ceremony. The Renaissance conversion Immediately after the defeat of the Kingdom of Hungary in the battle at Moh√°cs in 1526, during which the king died, the queen ‚Äì Maria of Habsburg ‚Äì fled with her retinue from Buda to Pressburg. The royal treasure (mostly very valuable objects of art, the royal scepter, apple and sword, the globe of Ladislaus of Jagiello known as Astrolabium etc.) and many other important objects she has taken with her were deposited in Pressburg Castle and guarded by the royal burgrave John Bornemisza. Shortly afterwards, however, this precious treasure was mostly destroyed by the new king Ferdinand I of Habsburg, who needed it to finance his participation in a civil war in Royal Hungary, and smaller parts went to the Treasury Chamber of Vienna (Wiener Schatzkammer), or became personal property of Maria, or got lost forever. Taking into account the new role of the castle, the emperor Ferdinand I. of Habsburg had it rebuilt into a Renaissance castle by Italian builders and artists, such as Giulio Licino da Pordanone and Maciotanus Ulisses from Rome, between 1552 and 1562 (but some work continued even afterwards). The main designer and supervisor of the construction was the Italian architect Pietro Ferrabosco, who had been serving the emperor in Vienna and knew Count Eck Salm, the captain of Pressburg from 1552 ‚Äì 1571. The building's form did not change (except that the entrance was shifted), but it was completely changed inside and outside. Above all, floors and rooms were rearranged, and most rooms received precious (golden etc.) equipment. In the late 16th century, a ball house (for various ball games) at the eastern wall and a second, better water well were added. Unfortunately, basically only one part of the castle chapel has been completely preserved from this time, paradoxically because it was walled up as ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù in the 17th century. As for the rest of the site, there were wooden dwellings for the guards (up to the 18th century) in the north-west, a (today unknown) ‚Äúold tower‚Äù somewhere to the left of the castle building was improved, and the western entrance gate of the site was replaced by a big armoury. In terms of the castle's functions after 1530, the castle was home to selected participants of Diet meetings (including apartments of the king (emperor), which have been already there since the Gothic reconstruction ), to some central authorities of Royal Hungary, the county head of Bratislava etc., to the apartment of the Governor of Royal Hungary (usually a brother of the emperor), and since 1552, the crown jewels were deposited here as well ‚Äì in what is today known as the Crown Tower. Initial and final meetings of the Diet took place in the castle too. Baroque conversions =Early Baroque= Since some of the Renaissance changes were done in haste (especially the wooden roof), as early as in 1616 a new, gradual Early Baroque reconstruction started based on a design by the main imperial architect Giovanni Battista Carlone. The works were intensified in 1635 and finished around 1647. It was mostly financed by Count Paul P√°lffy (P√°lfi), the captain of the castle and county head of Pozsony county. The look the castle received through this conversion is basically the look the castle has kept till the present. The northern and western part of the main building have been newly built and a new, 3rd floor was added in the whole building, the main entrance was shifted back to the middle of the wall, the ancient fortifications were improved, the chapel was shifted from the southern part to the northern part (today's Musical Hall), and 2 new towers were added ‚Äì yielding in sum the present 4 towers in the corners. As a reward for not having misappropriated state funds during the conversion, the Diet appointed Count Paul P√°lffy lifelong captain of Pressburg Castle, county head of the Pozsony county and usufructuary of the castle (which remained in possession of the crown) in 1650. One year later, the emperor made those functions and titles hereditary for the P√°lffys. In 1653, all wooden ceilings turned out to be bad and had to be replaced in the following years, so that precious paintings placed on them got lost. Ten years later, facing one of frequent Turkish (Ottoman) attacks to the territory of Slovakia, the fortifications were improved under the leadership of the military engineer Josef Priami of the Imperial Court in Vienna. Further improvements of the fortifications followed around 1673. They ended with the final defeat of the Turks at Vienna in 1683. In 1703, barracks were built in the north-east of the site and the armoury was turned into barracks too. The present-day Vienna Gate was constructed on the occasion of the coronation of Emperor Charles VI in 1712 and it was used as the main entrance to the castle site since then. =The Maria Theresa conversion= The reconstructed grand staircase dates to the times of Maria Theresa When Maria Theresa of Austria became the queen of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1740, she promised to the nobles of the kingdom that she would have a residence both in Austria and in the Kingdom of Hungary ‚Äì that is in Pressburg Castle. She kept the promise and spent much time in Bratislava. A corresponding conversion of the defense castle into a (at that time) modern royal residence was performed between 1761 and 1766. Minor changes however were done as early as from 1740 onwards: besides various changes in the interior, a large garden was added in the northern part of the site and Emperor Francis I (Maria Theresa's husband, who was interested in botany) created a small garden to the east of the castle building. The chief designer until 1757 was J. B. Martinelli. The Hungarian orders supported Maria Theresa with \\"Vitam et Sanguinem\\" exclamation marks in the castle at Seven Years' War's time. Major changes inside the castle (in the rococo style) were begun in 1760. The new chief designer between 1761 and 1762 was Franz Anton Hillebrandt. A new single floor building for the kitchen, servants and horses was added to the western wall of the castle. Because the water supply for the castle was not sufficient, Maria Theresa had Johann Wolfgang von Kempelen build a special water pipe drawing water from a tank in the town at the Danube bank using pumps. The stairs throughout the castle were rebuilt with a lower gradient, on Maria Theresa's request, to enable her to ride her horse upon them. The result of these changes, as for the exterior of the palace itself and the site gates, was very similar to Bratislava Castle as we know it today. Due to disputes with Hungarian nobles, Maria Theresa did not appoint a palatine, who used to represent the nobles, and instead in 1765 appointed a governor for the Kingdom of Hungary, who obeyed the queen. Bratislava Castle became his seat and the office of the county head left the castle. The second governor was Albert of Saxe-Teschen since 1765, the queen's son-in-law ‚Äì the husband of queen's favorite daughter, Marie Christine of Austria. Albert and Maria Christine moved to the castle in 1766. Since both of them were promoters of culture and science, the castle and the town became a place of frequent events and visits in the sphere of culture and science. Because the governor did not have enough space, a new palace (later called the Theresianum) was built at the eastern wall of the castle building in 1767 - 1770. It had been designed by Hillebrandt in the classic style. Its furnishings were very expensive and precious and included hundreds of objects of art. The first floor was home to a family gallery, which later became the basis of today's Albertina Gallery in Vienna.https://www.visitbratislava.com/places/bratislava-castle/ In addition, a winter riding school was added at the northern end of the castle site, a summer riding school was situated directly in the castle yard, both castle gardens were adapted (in the Sch√∂nbrunn style), and night lighting using oil lanterns was introduced on the access road to the castle for the first time in history. In 1770, Maria Theresa herself ordered further valuable paintings and furniture to be provided to both the main castle and the Theresianum, and the governor moved into the completed Theresianum. Maria Theresa visited them frequently there, however mostly unofficially. =Loss of importance and destruction (1783 ‚Äì 1811)= The office of governor of the Kingdom of Hungary was re-abolished in 1781 by the new king Joseph II, and Albert of Sachsen- Teschen left the castle and took many parts of the equipment away. The (present-day Albertina Gallery) art collection went partly to Vienna, partly to Belgium, where Albert became a new governor. Other objects moved mostly to Vienna. In 1783, Pressburg ceased to be the seat of central authorities of the kingdom. They were moved to Buda (now Budapest). The crown jewels of the Kingdom of Hungary were moved to the Hofburg in Vienna. In 1784, the Theresianum, some other secondary buildings of the site, and the gardens were adapted, because the castle became a \\"general seminary\\", which was a type of state school for Catholic priests introduced by Joseph II. The general seminary of Pressburg Castle played an important role in Slovakia's history, because it has educated many important Slovak intellectuals, for example Anton Bernol√°k, the author of the first successful codification of a Slovak standard language. In 1802, the general seminary moved to another place, and the castle was assigned to the military as barracks. This was the beginning of the end of the castle. The rococo interiors of the castle were adapted in order to house some 1500 soldiers. In 1809, the Pressburg and the castle was bombarded by cannons by Napoleon's troops. On 28 May 1811, the castle burst into huge flames due to carelessness of garrison soldiers. The fire even spread into parts of the town. Pressburg Castle, mid-19th century =Castle in ruins (1811 ‚Äì 1953)= The destroyed castle gradually deteriorated. The military sold parts of the main castle buildings as construction materials in the surrounding areas. Between the two world wars, attempts were made to demolish the castle to build government offices and a university district on the castle hill and in its surroundings in the first Czechoslovak Republic and in the first Slovak Republic. Many parts of the site however continued to be used as barracks and adapted accordingly until 1946. In 1946, the ruin was opened to the public. Two years later, the town constructed an amphitheater in the northern part of the castle site. The amphitheater was in use for some 15 years. Films were shown there in the summer.http://www.slovakheritage.org/Castles/bratislava.htm =Restoration and modern history (after 1953)= Equestrian statue of King Svatopluk I at the Honorary Courtyard since 2010 Bratislava Castle and the roofs of Old Town trophy that has been restored as part of the renovation efforts Finally it was decided to restore the castle. Archaeological and architectural research started in 1953 and long restoration works began in 1957. The restoration was done to the last (Baroque) state of the main building, but at many places older (Gothic, Renaissance) preserved elements or parts have been restored. The Theresianum has not been restored and the Hillebrandt building of 1762 was restored only around the year 2000. The Slovak painter Janko Alexy gained recognition for the restoration of the castle. The finishing of the restoration in 1968 was interrupted in August 1968, when the castle was occupied by Warsaw Pact troops (see Prague Spring). On 28 October 1968, however, the Federation Law, turning the centralist state of Czechoslovakia into a federation of a Czech Socialist Republic (later called Czech Republic) and a Slovak Socialist Republic (later called Slovak Republic), was signed in the Federation Hall of the castle. On 3 September 1992, the new constitution of independent Slovakia was signed in the Knights Hall of the castle. Since 1968, the castle has been housing exhibitions of the Slovak National Museum and at the same time its rooms have been used by the National Council of the Slovak Republic (today the National Council of the Slovak Republic) for presentation purposes. In 1992, the castle housed a branch-office of the Czechoslovak president temporarily and later in the 1990s the Slovak president temporarily. It still houses the museum and the presentation rooms for the National Council of the Slovak Republic and for the president. A new restoration has been planned for years, because since 1968 (except for adding the Hillebrandt building) only minor adaptations have been performed, such as the 1988 creation of the Treasure Chamber, the 1995 replacement of glass in the arcades of the solemn staircase, and the 1996-97 complete repair of the roof. The last minor adaptations occurred on the occasion of the Bush-Putin Bratislava summit in February 2005. A massive reconstruction was started in 2008. It should take 5 years and cost 1.5 to 2 billion Slovak korunas (47.06 to 62.75 million euro).Bratislavsk√Ω hrad ƒçak√° miliardov√° rekon≈°trukcia at SME (in Slovak) On June 6, 2010 the reconstruction of the Honorary Courtyard of Bratislava Castle was completed with a large nationally televised unveiling ceremony of an equestrian statue of King Sv√§topluk I by Slovak sculptor J√°n Kulich.

It is a stop on the Kitchener line, and is a flag stop for Via Rail trains operating between Toronto, London and Sarnia. Via Rail Timetable: Toronto-London-Sarnia History The original site of Malton railway station was approximately west of the current GO Transit facility, where Scarboro Street crosses the tracks. The first station was a wood frame structure built in 1856 by the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), which was superseded by a second frame building in 1912. Ownership of the station was transferred to Canadian National Railway in 1920 when they acquired the GTR and they demolished that station in 1973. GO Transit constructed a completely new building and platforms, south of Derry Road and east of Airport Road, for the introduction of GO Train service in 1974. The International Limited was operated jointly by Via Rail and Amtrak between Chicago and Toronto. The service, which had started in 1982, was discontinued in 2004. Metrolinx, the parent of GO Transit, purchased the Weston Subdivision from Canadian National Railway in 2009, including this section of track. CN will continue to serve its freight customers in the area and VIA will operate trains on the line. Recent station renovations included improvements such as new walkways and a tunnel for pedestrian access to new platforms which have canopies rather than shelters, and expansion of the parking lot. The previous basic brick building has also been replaced by a new structure which offers improved facilities. The addition of elevators has now made the station fully accessible.

He performed a highly controversial psychiatric evaluation of Jack Ruby, and he was in charge of UCLA's department of psychiatry and the Neuropsychiatric Institute for 20 years. West was deeply involved in Korean War-era CIA brainwashing experiments, the Agency's notoriousHE CIA'S APPALLING HUMAN EXPERIMENTS WITH MIND CONTROL, History.com MK-Ultra mind-control program, and the use and intentional abuse of LSD (as it being administered to unwitting people, who then suffered traumatic hallucinations) - even at one point killing an elephant with it. West was also active in studying the creation and management of cults, and anti-death penalty activism. Early life West was born in Brooklyn, New York to a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant father and a mother who taught piano. He grew up in poverty in Madison, Wisconsin. He subsequently earned a degree in medicine from the University of Minnesota. Korean War POWs and brainwashing In the 1950s, West, then an Air Force doctor at Lackland Air Force Base, was appointed to a panel to discover why 36 of 59 airmen captured in the Korean War had confessed or co-operated in Korean allegations of war crimes committed by the United States. Amid speculation that the airmen had been brainwashed or drugged, West came to a simpler conclusion: \\"What we found enabled us to rule out drugs, hypnosis or other mysterious trickery,\\" he said. \\"It was just one device used to confuse, bewilder and torment our men until they were ready to confess to anything. That device was prolonged, chronic loss of sleep.\\" The airmen avoided being court-martialed for these events as a result of West's research. He then published a paper with the title \\"United States Airforce prisoners of the Chinese Communist. Methods of forceful indoctrination: Observations and Interviews.\\" Ross, Colin A., MD. The C.I.A. Doctors. (2006). Manitou Communications Inc., Texas, USA. Pg. 31 Project MKUltra West did his psychiatry residency at Cornell University, an MKUltra institution and site of the Human Ecology Fund. He later became a subcontractor for MKUltra subproject 43, a $20,800 grant by the CIA while he was chairman of the department of Psychiatry at the University of Oklahoma. The proposal submitted by West was titled \\"Psychophysiological Studies of Hypnosis and Suggestibility\\" with an accompanying document titled \\"Studies of Dissociative States\\". =LSD-related death of an elephant= One of the more unusual incidents in West's career took place in August 1962. He and two co-workers attempted to investigate the phenomenon of musth in elephants by dosing Tusko, a bull elephant at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Oklahoma City, with LSD. They expected that the drug would trigger a state similar to musth; instead, the animal began to have seizures 5 minutes after LSD was administered. Beginning twenty minutes later, West and his colleagues administered the antipsychotic promazine hydrochloride; they injected a total of 2800 mg over 11 minutes. This large promazine dose was not effective and may have contributed to the animal's death. It died an hour and 40 minutes after the LSD was given. Later, many theories developed about why Tusko had died. Some researchers thought that West and his colleagues had made the mistake of scaling up the dose in proportion to the animal's body weight, rather than its brain weight, and without considering other factors, such as its metabolic rate.Schmidt-Nielsen, K. (1972) How Animals Work. pp.86-89. Cambridge University Press Another theory was that while the LSD had caused Tusko distress, the drugs administered in an attempt to revive him caused death. Attempting to prove that the LSD alone had not been the cause of death, Ronald K. Siegel of UCLA repeated a variant of West's experiment on two elephants; he administered to two elephants equivalent doses (in milligrams per kilogram) to that which had been given to Tusko, mixing the LSD in their drinking water rather than directly injecting it. Neither elephant expired or exhibited any great distress, although both behaved strangely for a number of hours. Patty Hearst trial During Patty Hearst's 1976 trial, West was appointed by the court in his capacity as a brainwashing expert and worked without fee. Believing that Hearst displayed all the classic signs of coercion, brainwashing, and the Stockholm effect, he wrote a newspaper after the trial article asking President Carter to release Hearst from prison. Some weeks after her arrest, Hearst repudiated her SLA allegiance.NBC news Documentary Conflict with Scientologists According to West, Scientologists attempted to discredit him and get him fired, using methods similar to those used in Operation Freakout. This was allegedly done after his contributions to a 1980 textbook that classified Scientology as a cult. West participated in an American Psychiatric Association panel on cults. Each speaker had received a letter threatening a lawsuit if Scientology were mentioned; apparently others were intimidated. Only West, the last speaker, referred to the letter and the cult: > \\"I read parts of the letter to the 1,000-plus psychiatrists and then told > any Scientologists in the crowd to pay attention. I said I would like to > advise my colleagues that I consider Scientology a cult and L. Ron Hubbard a > quack and a fake. I wasn't about to let them intimidate me.\\" Personal life In 1999, West died at his home in Los Angeles at age 74. His family said the cause of death was metastatic cancer. In 2009, West's son John wrote a book, \\"The Last Goodnights: Assisting My Parents With Their Suicides\\", in which he said he helped his father end his life at the latter's choice, when he was terminally ill with cancer, by using prescription medication.

The game was first released for Xbox on 14 November 2001, and for GameCube on 7 January 2002, in North America respectively. In Europe, the game launched for both consoles on 3 May 2002. A Europe-exclusive PlayStation 2 port, titled Cel Damage Overdrive, was released as a budget title by System 3 under their Play It label on 12 December 2002. A high-definition remake, developed and published by Finish Line Games, and titled Cel Damage HD, was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on 22 April 2014 in North America and 14 May 2014 in the PAL region. An Xbox One port followed worldwide, via the Xbox Games Store, on 11 March 2016. A Nintendo Switch port was released via the Nintendo eShop on 28 March 2019. Cel Damage is a cartoony take on vehicular combat games, like those from the Twisted Metal series. The story focuses on six cartoon characters from a fictional cartoon show called \\"Cel Damage\\". The characters annihilate each other to the delight of TV audiences and, since they are cartoons, instantly regenerate. The player battles through thirteen different levels and three game modes. Weaponry for Cel Damage includes cartoon staples like vacuum nozzles and portable holes, mundane weaponry like chainsaws and baseball bats, and items like freeze rays, giant springs, and portable nuclear devices. Gameplay Cel Damage is a vehicle shooter in which players compete against one another using weapons to either gain smack points or stop other opponents from achieving their goal, depending on the game mode. Weapons include black holes, boxing gloves, grenades, chainsaws, baseball bats, chain guns, axes, and freeze rays. The three game modes are Smack Attack, in which players attack other players and/or computer players to gain a certain number of points first; Gate Relay, in which players race to checkpoints; and Flag Rally, in which players race to collect flags. Smack Attack is the only mode not initially locked (except in the PlayStation 2 version). Additional characters and areas are also unlockable in the game. The HD re-release in 2014 contained small differences from the original such as including life-bars and altering the method to unlock certain items, but otherwise contains the same content with a few new weapons and a new stage. Cel Damage features ten characters, six automatically given at the beginning of the game and four unlockable \\"guest star\\" characters. Plot In the game, Cel Damage is a popular animated demolition derby series that airs weekly on the fictional network \\"'Toon T.V.\\"Cel Damage GameCube Instruction Booklet, p. 7 The characters in Cel Damage are a select few of cartoon characters who battle every week to achieve fame and glory. The characters use their own vehiclesCel Damage GameCube Instruction Booklet, pp. 13-16 and battle using a variety of deadly weapons.Cel Damage GameCube Instruction Booklet, p. 17 Because the characters in Cel Damage are cartoons, they cannot be killed and can continuously come back to fight again. Development The Cel Damage graphics engine uses a rendering technique called cel-shading to produce this cartoon- like appearance. Furthermore, the physics engine in Cel Damage is unique. Rather than aiming to simulate realistic real-world physics, it emulates complex cartoon physics; the physics engine calculates the relevant parts of physical interaction as they would in reality, and then distorts the physical laws to produce a cartoon-like interaction. This can be seen, for example, when a car turns and the entire shape of the car deforms and flexes into the turning direction. Cars and game objects can realistically be sliced into pieces, flattened, frozen, shattered, shredded, impaled, lit on fire (and subsequently burn to a crisp and fall into ashes), and more. Chris Hecker, editor of Game Developer magazine, described Cel Damage's cartoon-style graphics as \\"state-of-the-art for computer-game physics\\". Cel Damage was released as Cel Damage: Overdrive, a Europe-only title for the PlayStation 2. Play It released the game on 12 December 2002. Reception Cel Damage was generally praised for its cartoon graphics, but received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Gerald Villoria of GameSpot called the Xbox version's visuals \\"impressive,\\" and stated that the player \\"can easily think that [they are] playing a real-time cartoon\\". However, he added that some weapons in the game were far more useful than others, making the game a repetitive race to get the best weapon. Vincent Lopez of IGN said the cel shading in the same version \\"was one of the best examples of the effect on the market,\\" but that the game play is too difficult due to both the computer players and the small arenas. Brian Davis of GameSpy praised the same version for its characters and maintaining its cartoon feel, but found that the game play was too short.  Sequel  In 2002, Pseudo Interactive created an early prototype for a sequel to Cel Damage and pitched the project to Electronic Arts, Sega, Ubisoft, and Midway Games. The proposal was declined by each of the publishers it was offered to, due to the poor sales performance of the first game and concerns with the marketability of the property.

He is best known for his murals in the Palace of Westminster depicting episodes in British history from the English Civil War to the Glorious Revolution. Life =Early career= Ward was born in Pimlico, London. As a youth, he created illustrations for the well-known book Rejected Addresses, written by his uncles James and Horace Smith. He also created illustrations to the papers of Washington Irving. In 1830 he won the \\"silver palette\\" from the Society of Arts. With support from David Wilkie and Francis Leggatt Chantrey, he became a student at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1836 he travelled to Rome, gaining a silver medal from the Academy of St Luke in 1838 for his Cimabue and Giotto, which in the following year was exhibited at the Royal Academy. While a student at the Schools, Ward became a member of The Clique, a group of painters led by Richard Dadd. Like other members of the Clique Ward saw himself as a follower of Hogarth and Wilkie, considering their styles to be distinctly national in character. Many of his early paintings were set in the eighteenth century and were on Hogarthian subjects. He also painted episodes from seventeenth century history, influenced by the thinking of his friend, the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay. He also painted subjects from the history of the French Revolution. In 1843 he entered the Palace of Westminster cartoon competition, but failed to win a prize.The complex history surrounding the decoration is best summarized by T. S. R. Boase, The Decorations of the New Palace of Westminster 1841-1863, in: Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 17:1954, pp. 319‚Äì358. E.M. Ward, The South Sea Bubble (1846), a Hogarthian subject in the Tate Gallery =Opposition to Pre-Raphaelitism= In the 1850s Ward came into conflict with the Pre-Raphaelites, especially Millais, whose style of art he considered to be un-British. Ward's painting of Charlotte Corday being led to execution beat Millais's Ophelia for a prize at Liverpool, leading to much debate at the time. His historical paintings led to Ward's commission to paint eight scenes in the corridor leading into the House of Commons, despite the fact that he had won nothing at the original 1843 competition. These were to depict parallel episodes on the Royalist and Parliamentary sides in the Civil War. Ward's paintings depict the opposed figures as if confronting one another across the corridor. Leicester and Amy Robsart at Cumnor Hall (1866), after Walter Scott's novel Kenilworth =Later work= Ward continued to paint Hogarthian versions of episodes from British history throughout the 1860s, notably Hogarth's Studio in 1739 (1863; York Art Gallery) the Antechamber at Whitehall During the Dying Moments of Charles II (1865; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). In the 1870s he painted some modern-life genre subjects, but towards the end of the decade began to suffer painful illness and depression. On 10 January 1879 he was found raving on the floor of his dressing-room, his throat cut with a razor; he was shouting, \\"I was mad when I did it; the devil prompted me\\".The Times, 18 January 1879, p. 11 Medical help arrived, but he died on 15 January at his home, 3 Queens Villas, in Windsor. The inquest in Windsor on 17 January found that he committed suicide while temporarily insane.Wellcombe Library Catalogue Dr. Johnson in the ante-room of Lord Chesterfield in Chesterfield House, Westminster.

Shrewsbury Museums Service (SHYMS: FA/1995/008) Family In 1843, Ward met the 11-year-old Henrietta Ward (her maiden and married names were the same, but she was no relation); they married secretly in May 1848, after an elopement aided by Ward's friend Wilkie Collins. Henrietta's mother never forgave the elopement, and disinherited her. Collins may have based the plot of his 1852 novel Basil on the Ward engagement.Wilkie Collins, The Woman in White, Edited and with an Introduction and Notes by Matthew Sweet, London, Penguin Classics, 2003; Introduction, p. xxiii. Henrietta also became a successful painter. She became a notable art teacher after her husband's death and wrote two autobiographical memoirs about their life together.

The meeting takes place in the south of Venezuela, in Bolivar State, being the most important tributary of the Orinoco, mostly because of the high discharge rate.

Hydraulic regime Caron√≠ River in La Llovizna National Park, Puerto Ordaz Confluence of Caron√≠ River (in the background), a blackwater river with the Orinoco river, a whitewater river The Caroni is one of the rivers with the highest discharge rates in the world, with respect to the area of its basin. The average discharge is , with variations caused by the wet/dry seasons. The average maximum discharge is , and the average minimum is . Among the historic extremes are . The Caroni supplies 15.5 percent of the discharge of the Orinoco river. One of the characteristics of Caroni's water is the dark color, caused by the high amount of humic acids due to the incomplete decomposition of the phenol content of the vegetation. The Caroni therefore belongs to the blackwater rivers, as does the Negro River, or Rio Negro in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. In the late 1940s diamonds were found in the Caroni basin near the famous Lost World Region which then was accessible only by aircraft and four wheel drive vehicles.\\"Treasure Hunt In A Lost World.\\" Popular Mechanics, September 1950, pp. 73‚Äì79. Basin The river drains the Guayanan Highlands moist forests ecoregion. The Caroni basin covers and is part of the Orinoco basin, the most important river of Venezuela. This means for the two big rivers that they have very similar hydrographic characteristics. The Caroni itself and its tributary the Paragua are rivers with a staircase, in the sense that many falls and rapids are alternated with stretches with gentle slopes, with many meanders and oxbow lakes (naturally cut off meanders). Among the most important falls of these rivers and their tributaries may be mentioned the Angel Falls, with the highest free fall of the world, almost , and the Kukenan Falls, the tenth on the world scale with a free fall. Others are falls with less height but with a high volume of water, like the Aponwao Falls and the Caruay Falls, and rivers with these names: the Toron River, the Eutobarima River, the falls of the La Llovizna and the Cachamay River, these last three in the Caroni itself and the last just before its discharge into the Orinoco. Hydroelectric power The Caron√≠ River and the Guri Reservoir Because of its high discharge rate, with a yearly average of and a steep slope, the Caroni ideally suited for the generation of hydroelectric energy with four plants along its course (Macagua I, II and III), near its mouth, the Caruachi, some aback, and lastly the plant of Guri, in the middle of Necoima or Necuima, some from Puerto Ordaz. This plant has its reservoir, with an area of , in the middle of the river, and has a power of 10,000 MW, and is now the third biggest in the world, after the Three Gorges dam in China (22,500 MW) and the Itaipu Dam in Paraguay and Brazil (14,000 MW) National Parks In the high basin of the rivers that form the Caroni (Aponguao, Cuquen√°n and Yuruan√≠) the Gran Sabana is spread out, partly belonging to the Canaima National Park. Tourism The basin of the Caroni is one of the most spectacular and beautiful of the world, ideal for adventure tourism: a landscape of forests and savannah, innumerable waterfalls and cataracts, deep canyons and high plateaux, fast running streams with very clean water (darkly tinted, almost black when deep, blackwater river, beaches with pink sand, etc. Among the most notable of the basin of the Caroni, speaking for tourists, are the waterfalls of the Aponguao, of the Kama (Kama Meru in the Caribbean language) pemon, Eutobarima (in the Caroni itself, although not easily accessible), the lake and the plant of Guri, the parks of the waterfall and of the gorge of Kavak, the table mountains (tepuis) of the Roraima and the Kukenan. Mining Along the Caron√≠ River between the confluence with the Icabar√∫ River and San Salvador de Pa√∫l, there are several artisanal gold mines, mainly on the left hand side of the river outside the national park, but a few can also be found on the right hand side inside the Canaima National Park. Besides the devastating effects of logging and deforestation to clear the site for the mines, the far greater danger is the use of mercury which poisons the Caron√≠ river, its fauna and inhabitants living along its shore. High levels of mercury have been found not only in the Caron√≠ river but also in Lake Guri and further downstream. The current government of Venezuela has pledged to reduce illegal mining activities with the sustainable development plan for mining 2016-2018. Illegal mining surged under the government of Hugo Ch√°vez, due to the nationalization of mines run by international mining companies and this had the negative consequence of an increase of mercury use as other processes are more difficult and costly to use for illegal, artisanal mining.https://es.mongabay.com/2016/01/mineria-de-oro-en-venezuela-una- tormenta-perfecta-de-mineria-ilegal-deforestacion-y-mafias/ The fact that a river that is partly flowing through a national park is affected by this development is particularly troubling.

The nonprofit organization currently numbers some 300 individuals worldwide. The group has published The Baker Street Journal ‚Äî an \\"irregular quarterly of Sherlockiana\\" ‚Äî since 1946.  History  Baker Street Irregulars Fletcher Pratt, Christopher Morley and Rex Stout (1944) The BSI was an outgrowth of Christopher Morley's informal group, \\"the Three Hours for Lunch Club,\\" which discussed art and literature. The inaugural meeting of the BSI was held in 1934 at Christ Cella's restaurant in New York City. Initial attendees included William Gillette, Vincent Starrett, Alexander Woollcott, and Gene Tunney. Morley kept meetings quite irregular, but after leadership passed to Edgar W. Smith, meetings became more regular. In February 1934, Elmer Davis, a friend of Morley, authored a constitution for the group explaining their purpose and explaining that anyone who passed a certain test was eligible to join. The May 1934 issue of Saturday Review of Literature featured the aforementioned \\"test\\" which was a crossword puzzle authored by Christopher Morley's younger brother, Frank. The organization long resisted admitting women, a policy which spawned a female-centered organization, the Adventuresses of Sherlock Holmes, whose founders had picketed an all-male BSI gathering. In 1991, the first female invested in the BSI was Dame Jean Conan Doyle. She was followed by Katherine McMahon, the first woman to solve the crossword puzzle. McMahon was followed by Edith Meiser, author of numerous Holmesian radio scripts for The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Members of the society participate in \\"the game\\" which postulates that Holmes and Doctor Watson were real and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was merely Watson's \\"literary agent\\". Membership Membership is by invitation only based on criteria unknown to the public. Members take on a name inspired by the canon with the head of the organization known as \\"Wiggins\\". Since its inception, the organization has had only 701 members.

In popular usage the term \\"central casting\\" has come to denote an unspecified source of stereotypical types for film or television, as in a character being \\"straight out of central casting\\". History Inside the original Central Casting office in the Hollywood & Western Building (1929) = Los Angeles = Central Casting was established on December 4, 1925 as the Central Casting Bureau by Will H. Hays and the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) in an effort to regulate the thousands who sought employment as extras in the film industry. Hays had four main goals for Central Casting: to do away with the high fees extras were charged by private employment agencies, to ensure extras were paid legally, to discourage the influx of people flocking to Hollywood to seek employment as extras, and to provide steady employment to qualified extras. To carry out his vision, Hays hired Fred Beetson as president and on January 25, 1926, Central Casting officially opened its office in the Hollywood & Western Building in Hollywood. For the estimated 30,000 aspiring extras in Hollywood, Central Casting became the only source of extra work. In the first six months of operation, the agency registered more than 18,000 extras and made 113,873 placements. Many Hollywood legends started their careers with Central Casting, including Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, and Gary Cooper. In 1944, the agency introduced a second phone line, GArfield 3621 for men and GArfield 3711 for women. Though registration decreased due to World War II, the switchboard often received up to 4,000 calls an hour from extras looking for work. In 1976, the Motion Picture Association of America (the former MPPDA) sold Central Casting to Production Payment, Inc., a subsidiary of Talent & Residuals, making the agency privately owned for the first time. When the agency‚Äôs parent company International Digitronics Corporation merged with Draney Information Services Corporation in 1991, Central Casting merged with Richmar Casting to become part of the newly formed Entertainment Partners. During this process, Central Casting overhauled their digital casting system, making it easier for casting directors to search through their 15,000 registered extras. Around this time, extras begin to refer to themselves as background actors. = New York = In April 2006, Central Casting New York opened in Manhattan, the first Central Casting office to open outside of Los Angeles. Some early projects cast by the New York office included Law & Order, The Sopranos, and Spider-Man 3. In April 2018, the office moved to its new location on the 10th floor of 5 Pennsylvania Plaza. = Louisiana = After casting thousands of background actors for Jurassic World, Central Casting Louisiana opened an office in Benson Tower in New Orleans on September 23, 2014.

An air burst or airburst is the detonation of an explosive device such as an anti-personnel artillery shell or a nuclear weapon in the air instead of on contact with the ground or target. The principal military advantage of an air burst over a ground burst is that the energy from the explosion (as well as any shell fragments) is distributed more evenly over a wider area; however, the peak energy is lower at ground zero. Air burst may also refer to naturally occurring explosion of meteors in the atmosphere, e.g. the Tunguska event and the Chelyabinsk meteor.  History  The airburst fuzing system on a modern Carl Gustav recoilless rifle High Explosive round Air burst artillery has a long history. The shrapnel shell was invented by Henry Shrapnel of the British Army in about 1780 to increase the effectiveness of canister shot. It was widely used by the time of the War of 1812 and stayed in use until it was superseded during the First World War. Modern shells, though sometimes called \\"shrapnel shells\\", actually produce fragments and splinters, not shrapnel. Air bursts were used in the First World War to shower enemy positions and men with shrapnel balls to kill the largest possible number with a single burst, assuming that the burst was directly in front of the trench in which the men were positioned. When infantry moved into deep trenches, shrapnel shells were rendered useless and high-explosive shells were used to attack field fortifications and troops in the open. The time fuses for the shells could be set to function on contact or in the air, or at a certain time after contact. During World War II a \\"proximity fuze\\" was developed for antiaircraft use, controlled by a doppler radar device within the shell that caused it to explode when near the target. The idea was later adapted for use against ground targets. During the Vietnam War, air bursting shells were used to great effect to defend bases. This tactic was known as \\"Killer Junior\\" when referring to 105 mm or 155 mm shells, and \\"Killer Senior\\" when employed with larger howitzers.Major General David Ewing Ott. FIELD ARTILLERY, 1954‚Äì1973. Department of the Army. Washington, D.C., 1975. Some anti-personnel bouncing mines such as Germany's World War II \\"Bouncing Betty\\" fire a grenade into the air, which detonates at waist level, increasing the blast radius and harm inflicted by detonation, shock wave, and flying splinters. A relatively recent example of airburst munitions is the VOG-25P \\"jumping\\" 40 mm caseless grenade, which contains a secondary charge to launch it up to 1.5 meters above its point of impact before the main charge detonates. Another recent development are computer programmable air burst grenades with fire control system. Grenade launchers using this technology include the XM29, XM307, PAPOP, Mk 47 Striker, XM25, Barrett XM109, K11, QTS-11, Norinco LG5 / QLU-11 and Multi Caliber Individual Weapon System. Orbital ATK developed air burst rounds for autocannons.https://www.orbitalatk.com/defense-systems/small-caliber- systems/30-20mmx173mm/docs/30-20x173_Fact_Sheet.pdf = Nuclear weapons = A blast wave reflecting from a surface and forming a mach stem The air burst is usually above the hypocenter to allow the shockwave of the fission or fusion driven explosion to bounce off the ground and back into itself, creating a shockwave that is more forceful than one from a detonation at ground level. This \\"mach stem\\" only occurs near ground level, and is similar in shape to the letter Y when viewed from the side. Airbursting also minimizes fallout by keeping the fireball from touching the ground, limiting the amount of debris that is vaporized and drawn up in the radioactive debris cloud. For the Hiroshima bomb, an air burst above the ground was chosen \\"to achieve maximum blast effects, and to minimize residual radiation on the ground as it was hoped U.S. troops would soon occupy the city\\".Nichols, K. D., The Road to Trinity pages 175, 198, 223 (1987, Morrow, New York)  Tactics  In conventional warfare, air bursts are used primarily against infantry in the open or unarmored targets, as the resulting fragments cover a large area but will not penetrate armor, entrenchments, or fortifications. In nuclear warfare, air bursts are used against soft targets (i.e. lacking the hardened construction required to survive overpressure from a nuclear explosion) such as cities in countervalue targeting, or airfields, radar systems and mobile ICBMs in counterforce targeting. =Killer Junior and Senior= Killer Junior and Killer Senior are techniques of employing artillery direct fire air bursts, first developed during the Vietnam War. The technique involves a howitzer firing a high explosive (HE) shell using a mechanical time‚Äìsuper quick (MTSQ) artillery fuze set to cause an airburst over a target in very close proximity to the firing gun's position. Set properly, the shell would detonate approximately above the ground at ranges of 200 to 1,000 meters. The term Killer Junior was applied to this technique when used with 105 mm or 155 mm howitzers, and the term Killer Senior applied to its use with the M115 203 mm (8-inch) howitzer. The term \\"Killer\\" came from the call-sign of the battery which developed the technique. The technique was later perfected by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Dean, commander of the 1st Battalion, 8th Field Artillery Regiment, of the 25th Infantry Division Artillery. Killers Junior and Senior were developed as alternatives to the Beehive flechette rounds previously used against nearby enemy troops. The advantage of the Killer techniques over Beehive is that the airburst projects fragments in all directions, and is able to wound enemies crawling or lying in defilade, whereas the flechettes of a Beehive round would simply fly harmlessly over a low target.

The speed limit, on the expressway portion is 100 km/h. For the citizens who live and work in both cities, Highbury Avenue is considered an essential commuter route between both cities and also to Highway 401 and Highway 402.  Route description  Highbury Avenue begins at South Edgeware Road in St. Thomas where it proceeds north as a two-lane highway (Elgin County Road 30) until Wilton Grove Road in London. From there it briefly becomes a four-lane, expressway north from Highway 401 to Hamilton Road. It then continues north as a four-lane arterial street through the rest of London. At approximately Fanshawe Park Road, Highbury Avenue continues north from London as a two-lane highway (Middlesex County Road 23), where it ends at Elginfield Road (Highway 7).  History  The expressway portion was completed as such in 1966 after nearly three years as a two-lane road from the 401 northward. This road was originally planned to be completed as part of a network of expressways to serve London along the Thames River. However, local opposition led to this expressway portion of Highbury ending at Hamilton Road. The road was given provincial highway status as Highway 126 on December 9, 1963. For a time the expressway portion of the road inside city limits of the time was unofficially named \\"George Wenige Expressway\\" after a former mayor of London, George Wenige. There were also plans to extend the expressway south to St. Thomas, but these plans were shelved. In 1989, the interchange at the intersection of Bradley Avenue and Highbury was completed. In 1991, responsibility for Highway 126 was transferred from the provincial government to the City of London. Later in 1994, the Highbury Avenue interchange and overpass at Highway 401 was reconstructed. The reconstruction led to the cloverleaf interchange being converted to a Parclo-A4 interchange configuration with traffic lights, no longer being completely controlled- access (freeway-to-freeway).

A total of seven nuclear tests were performed, with approximate yields ranging from . Two major test series were conducted at the Maralinga site: Operation Buffalo in 1956 and Operation Antler the following year. Operation Buffalo consisted of four tests; One Tree () and Breakaway () were detonated on towers, Marcoo () at ground level, and the Kite () was released by a Royal Air Force (RAF) Vickers Valiant bomber from a height of . This was the first drop of a British nuclear weapon from an aircraft. Operation Buffalo was followed by Operation Antler in 1957, which tested new, light-weight nuclear weapons. Three tests were conducted in this series: Tadje (, Biak and Taranak . The first two were conducted from towers, while the last was suspended from balloons. Tadje used cobalt pellets as a tracer for determining yield, resulting in rumours that Britain was developing a cobalt bomb. Between 1956 and 1963, the Maralinga site was also used for minor trials, tests of nuclear weapons components not involving nuclear explosions. Kittens were trials of neutron initiators; Rats and Tims measured how the fissile core of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the high explosive shock wave; and Vixens investigated the effects of fire or non-nuclear explosions on atomic weapons. Ultimately, the minor trials generated more contamination than the major tests. The site was left contaminated with radioactive waste, and an initial clean up was attempted in 1967. The McClelland Royal Commission, an examination of the effects of the minor trials and major tests, delivered its report in 1985, and found that significant radiation hazards still existed at many of the Maralinga sites. It recommended another clean up, which was completed in 2000 at a cost of AUD $108 million (equivalent to $ in ). Debate continued over the safety of the site and the long-term health effects on the traditional Aboriginal custodians of the land and former personnel. In 1994, the Australian Government paid compensation amounting to $13.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to the traditional owners, the Maralinga Tjarutja people. Their land was fully restored to them in 2014. By the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some journalists investigated the subject and political scrutiny became more intense. Journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission. In June 1993, New Scientist journalist Ian Anderson wrote an article titled \\"Britain's dirty deeds at Maralinga\\" and several related articles. In 2007, Maralinga: Australia's Nuclear Waste Cover-up by Alan Parkinson documented the unsuccessful clean-up at Maralinga. Popular songs about the Maralinga story have been written by Paul Kelly, Midnight Oil and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. Background During the early part of the Second World War, Britain had a nuclear weapons project, code-named Tube Alloys, which the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged with the American Manhattan Project to create a combined American, British, and Canadian project. The British Government expected that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it regarded as a joint discovery, after the war, but the US Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) ended technical co-operation. Fearing a resurgence of United States isolationism, and Britain losing its great power status, the British Government restarted its own development effort, under the cover name \\"High Explosive Research\\". United Kingdom Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys (centre) meets with Howard Beale (right), the Australian Minister for Supply in August 1957. In the 1950s Britain was still Australia's largest trading partner, although it was overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. Britain and Australia still had strong cultural ties, and Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia from 1949 to 1966, was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, mainly because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage on ships from the UK to Australia. Australian and British troops fought together in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 and the Malayan Emergency that went from 1948 to 1960. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing British forces in the Middle East and Far East. The Australian Government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on both nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and was particularly interested in developing the former, as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for nuclear power were considered along with hydroelectricity as part of the post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme, but Australia was not a party to the 1948 Modus Vivendi, the nuclear agreement between the US and UK which superseded the wartime Quebec Agreement. This cut Australian scientists off from technical information to which they formerly had access. Britain would not share it with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise the far more important relationship with the United States, and the Americans were reluctant to do so after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia. The creation of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 1949 excluded Australia from the Western Alliance. On 3 October 1952 the United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon in Operation Hurricane in the Montebello Islands off the coast of Western Australia. A year later the first nuclear tests on the Australian mainland were carried out in Operation Totem at Emu Field in the Great Victoria Desert in South Australia, with a detonation on 15 October and a second two weeks later on 27 October. The Australian Minister for Supply, Howard Beale, stated in 1955 that \\"England has the know how; we have the open spaces, much technical skill and a great willingness to help the Motherland. Between us we should help to build the defences of the free world, and make historic advances in harnessing the forces of nature.\\" Maralinga site =Selection= Neither the Montebello Islands nor Emu Field were considered suitable as permanent test sites, although Montebello was used again in 1956 for Operation Mosaic. Montebello could be accessed only by sea, and Emu Field had problems with its water supply and dust storms. The British Government's preferred permanent test site remained the Nevada Test Site in the United States, but by 1953 it was no closer to securing access to it than it had been in 1950. When William Penney, the Chief Superintendent Armament Research, visited South Australia in October 1952, he gave the Australian Government a summary of the requirements of a permanent test site. In May 1953, the UK Chiefs of Staff Committee were advised that one was needed. They delegated the task of finding one to Air Marshal Sir Thomas Elmhirst, the chairman of the Totem Executive (Totex), which had been formed in the UK to coordinate the Operation Totem tests. He wrote to J. E. S. Stevens, the permanent secretary of the Australian Department of Supply, and the chairman of the Totem Panel that coordinated the Australian contribution to Operation Totem, and outlined the requirements of a permanent test site, which were: * A radius free of human habitation; * Road and rail communications to a port; * A nearby airport; * A tolerable climate for staff and visitors; * Low rainfall; * Predictable weather conditions; * Winds that would carry the fallout safely away from inhabited areas; and * Reasonably flat terrain; * Isolation for security. Elmhirst suggested that a site might be found in Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria or north of Emu Field, where it could be connected by road and rail to Oodnadatta, and where water could more easily be found than at Emu Field. Stevens rated both as unsuitable; Groote Eylandt was wooded and rocky, with a pronounced rainy season, no port facilities, and a long way from the nearest major settlements of Darwin and Cairns; while the area north of Emu Field had scarce water, few roads and was on the axis of the Long Range Weapons Establishment (LRWE), which meant that there would be a competing claim on the use of the area. Group Captain George Pither conducted an aerial survey of the area north of the Trans-Australian Railway between Ooldea and Cook, South Australia. This was followed by a ground reconnaissance in four land rovers and two four-wheel drive trucks by Pither, Wing Commander Kevin Connolly, Frank Beavis (an expert in soil chemistry), Len Beadell and the two truck drivers. An area was found north of Ooldea, and a temporary airstrip was created in two days by land rovers dragging a length of railway line to level it, where Penney, Flight Lieutenant Charles Taplin and Chief Scientist Alan Butement landed in a Bristol Freighter on 17 October 1953, two days after the Totem 1 test at Emu Field. Emu-Ooldea-Tietkens Well reconnaissance The site, initially known as X.300, was nowhere near as good as the Nevada Test Site, with its excellent communications, but was considered acceptable. It was flat and dry, but not affected by dust storms like Emu Field, and the geologists were confident that the desired per annum could be obtained by boring. Rainwater tanks were recommended, and it was estimated that if bore water could not be obtained, a water pipeline could be laid to bring water from Port Augusta. This was estimated to cost AU ¬£53,000 to construct and AU ¬£50,000 per annum to operate. On 25 November, Butement officially named the X.300 site \\"Maralinga\\" in a meeting at the Department of Supply. This was an Aboriginal word meaning \\"thunder\\", but not in the Western Desert language of the local people; it came from Garik, an extinct language originally spoken around Port Essington in the Northern Territory. On 2 August 1954, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia lodged a formal request for a permanent proving ground for multiple series of nuclear tests expected to be conducted over the course of the next decade and a preliminary agreement between the Australian and British Governments was reached on 26 August. A mission consisting of six officials and scientists headed by J. M. Wilson, the under-secretary of the UK Ministry of Supply (MoS) visited Australia in December to evaluate the Maralinga site, and reported that it was excellent. The new site was officially announced by Beale on 4 April 1955, although the Australian Cabinet did not give its assent until 4 May. A formal Memorandum of Arrangements for use of Maralinga was signed on 7 March 1956. It specified that the site would be available for ten years; that no thermonuclear tests would be carried out; that the British Government would be liable for all claims of death or injury to people or damage to property as a result of the tests, except those to British Government personnel; that Australian concurrence would be required before any test could be carried out; and that the Australian authorities would be kept fully informed. Maralinga was to be developed as a joint facility, co-funded by the British and Australian Governments. The range covered , with a test area. With savings arising from the relocation of buildings, stores and equipment from Emu Field taken into account, the cost of developing Maralinga as a permanent site was estimated to cost AU ¬£1.9 million, compared with AU ¬£3.6 million for Emu Field. The British Government welcomed Australian financial assistance, and Australian participation avoided the embarrassment that would have come from building a UK base on Australian soil. On the other hand, it was recognised that Australian participation would likely mean that the Australians would demand access to even more information than in Operation Totem. This had implications for Britain's relationship with the United States. Sharing information with the Australians would make it much harder to secure Britain's ultimate goal, of restoring the wartime nuclear Special Relationship with the United States, and gaining access to information pertaining to the design and manufacture of US nuclear weapons. =Development= Cutting a temporary access road from Watson to Tietkens Well A railhead and a quarry were established at Watson, about west of Ooldea, and Beadell's bush track from Watson to Emu became the main line of communications for the project. It ran north to the edge of the Nullarbor Plain, then over sand hills and the Leisler Range, a mallee, spinifex and quandong covered escarpment, rising to an altitude of . Range headquarters, known as The Village, and an airstrip with a runway were built near the peg. The track continued north over scrub-cover sand hills to the Teitkins Plain. There at a point that came to be known as Roadside, a control point was established for entry to the forward area where bombs were detonated. The UK MoS engaged a firm of British engineering consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, to design the test facilities and supervise their construction. The work was carried out by the Kwinana Construction Group (KCG) under a cost-plus contract. It had just finished the construction of an oil refinery near Fremantle, and it was hoped that it could move on to the new venture immediately, but the delay in obtaining Cabinet's approval meant that work could not start until mid-1955, by which time most of its work force had dispersed. The need to create a new work force caused a cascading series of delays. Assembling a labour force of 1,000 from scratch in such a remote location proved difficult, even when KCG was offering wages as high as AU ¬£40 a week (). The Australian Government elected to create a tri-service task force to construct the test installations. The Australian Army's Engineer in Chief, Brigadier Ronald McNicoll designated Major Owen Magee, the Commander, Royal Australian Engineers, Western Command, to lead this task force. He joined a party headed by Lieutenant Colonel John Blomfield, the MoS Atomic Weapons representative in Australia, on a site inspection, and then flew to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston in the UK in a Royal Air Force (RAF) Handley Page Hastings to review the plans. These were still incomplete, but it gave Magee sufficient information to prepare estimates of the labour and equipment that would be required. The job involved the erection of towers, siting of instrument mounts, grading of of tracks, laying control cables and power lines, and construction of bunkers and other facilities dispersed over an area of but sited to within an accuracy of . The work force could not be fully assembled before 1 March 1956, but the facilities had to be ready for use by the end of July. provided Bloomfield with a list of required stores and equipment. These ranged from timber and nails to drafting gear and two wagon drills. Maralinga Committee visits the site. Butement is third from the left. The task force, which began assembling in February 1956, included a section from the Royal Australian Survey Corps, a troop of the 7th Field Squadron, detachments from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and a civilian from the Department of Works and Housing. Their first task was establishing their own camp, with tents, showers and toilets. A team from the South Australian Department of Mines sank a series of bores to provide water. Like that at Emu Field, the bore water was brackish. Two Army skid-mounted Cleaver-Brooks thermocompression distillation units provided water for drinking and cooking. Work on the facilities themselves got off to a slow start, as KCG was running behind schedule, and unable to release promised earthmoving plant. Some graders were used by day by KCG and by night by the task force. A call to Blomfield resulted in a grader being shipped from Adelaide to Watson two days later. The arrival of a 23-man detachment of the Radiation Detection Unit of the Corps of Royal Canadian Engineers was expedited so they arrived in June, and were able to pitch in with the construction effort. In July, supplies coming from the UK were delayed by industrial action at the port of Adelaide. The work involved laying, testing and burying some of control cable. Each spool of cable weighed about , so where possible they were pre-positioned. The trenches were dug by a cable plough towed by a Caterpillar D8 tractor. In some cases the limestone was too hard for the plough and the cable was buried by using a grader to cover the cable to the required depth. A similar procedure was followed for laying of power cable. Some 1,300 scaffold frames were erected for mounting instrumentation, held in place by 33,000 anchor pipes. Bunkers ranging in size up to were excavated with explosives and a compressor mounted on a four-wheel drive 3-ton Bedford truck connected to the jackhammer part of the 4-inch wagon drill. Explosives were in the form of tubes of plastic explosive left over from a Bureau of Mineral Resources seismic survey of the area. The bunker work proceeded so well that the task force was able to assist KCG with its pit excavation work. Some instrument bunkers contained steel cubes. Getting them into the holes was tricky because they weighed , and the largest available crane was a Coles crane. They were manoeuvred into place with the assistance of a TD 24 bulldozer. The Coles crane was also used to erect the two shot towers. Concrete was made in situ, using local quarry dust, limestone and bore water. The Canadians erected metal sheds of a commercial design, which were used to assess blast damage. A tented camp was built for observers at the post by the 23rd Construction Squadron. Giles Weather Station in 1955. The 44-gallon drums hold bore water. Pressed for time, Magee became involved in a series of disputes with the Woomera Range commander, who tried to divert his sappers onto other tasks. In June, the range commander ordered the surveyors to return to Adelaide, which would have brought the work at Maralinga to a halt. Magee went over his head and appealed to the commander of Central Command, Major General Arthur Wilson, who flew up from Adelaide and sacked the range commander. Impressed by what he saw at Maralinga, Wilson arranged for the task force to receive a special Maralinga allowance of 16 Australian shillings per day (), and additional leave of two days per month. The British Government added a generous meal allowance of GBP ¬£1 () per day, resulting in a diet of steak, ham, turkey, oysters and crayfish. In June, Beale flew in two planeloads of journalists, including Chapman Pincher and Hugh Buggy for a press conference. The task force completed all its work on 29 July, two days ahead of schedule, although KCG still had a few remaining tasks. By 1959, the Maralinga village would have accommodation for 750 people, with catering facilities that could cope with up to 1,600. There were laboratories and workshops, shops, a hospital, church, power station, post office, bank, library, cinema and swimming pool. There were also playing areas for tennis, Australian football, cricket and golf. Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee Leslie Martin, the scientific adviser at the Department of Defence, could see no issues with the proposed tests, but recommended that in view of the prospect of tests being conducted at Maralinga on a regular basis, and rising concern worldwide over radioactive fallout from nuclear tests, that a permanent body be established to certify the safety of the tests. This was accepted, and the acting secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Frederick Chilton, put forward the names of five scientists: Butement; Martin; Ernest Titterton from the Australian National University in Canberra; Philip Baxter from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission; and Cecil Eddy from the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory. Butement, Martin and Titterton had already been observers at the Operation Mosaic and Operation Totem tests. The Department of Defence favoured a committee of three, but Menzies felt that such a small committee would not command sufficient public confidence, and accepted all five. A notable omission was the lack of a meteorologist, and Leonard Dwyer, the director of the Bureau of Meteorology was later added. The Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee (AWTSC) was officially formed on 21 July 1955. Aboriginal affairs Menzies told parliament that \\"no conceivable injury to life, men or property could emerge from the tests\\". The Maralinga site was inhabited by the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara Aboriginal people, for whom it had a great spiritual significance. They lived through hunting and gathering activities, and moved over long distances between permanent and semi-permanent locations in groups of about 25, but coming together for special occasions. The construction of the Trans-Australian Railway in 1917 had disrupted their traditional patterns of movement. Walter MacDougall had been appointed the Native Patrol Officer at Woomera on 4 November 1947, with responsibility for ensuring that Aboriginal people were not harmed by the LRWE's rocket testing program. He was initially assigned to the Department of Works and Housing but was transferred to the Department of Supply in May 1949. As the range of the rockets increased, so too did the range of his patrols, from in October 1949 to in March and April 1952. MacDougall felt that his situation was not appreciated by his superiors, who did not supply him with a vehicle for his own use for three years. MacDougall estimated that about 1,000 Aboriginal people lived in the Central Australian reserve, which extended to the border with Western Australia. He found them reluctant to reveal important details such as the location of water holes and sacred sites. His first concern was for their safety, and for that he needed to keep them away from the test site. For this he employed three strategies. The first was to remove the incentive to go there. An important lure was the availability of rations at Ooldea and surrounding missions, so he had them closed. The Ooldea mission was closed in June 1952, and the reserve was revoked in February 1954. The inhabitants were moved to a new settlement at Yalata, but many ritual objects had been concealed and left behind. They preferred the landscape of the desert, and many left Yalata to return to their traditional lands. A more successful tactic was to frighten them. The desert was said to be inhabited by wanampi, dangerous rainbow serpent spirits that lived in blowholes in the area. The noise of the nuclear tests was attributed to wanampi, as were the dangers of radiation. The decision to establish the Giles Weather Station in the Rawlinson Ranges was a complicating factor because it was outside MacDougall's jurisdiction, being just across the border in Western Australia, where the legal environment was different, and the Aboriginal people there had little contact with white people. Another patrol officer position was created, one with powers under the 1954 Western Australian Native Welfare Act, which was filled by a Sydney University graduate, Robert Macaulay.  Operation Buffalo  = Planning and purpose = Operation Buffalo was the first nuclear test series to be conducted at Maralinga, and the largest ever held in Australia. Planning for the series, initially codenamed Theta, began in mid-1954. It was initially scheduled for April and May 1956, but was pushed back to September and October, when meteorological conditions were most favourable. Ultimately all tests on the Australian mainland were conducted at this time of year. The 1954 plan for Operation Theta called for four tests, each with a different purpose. The UK's first nuclear weapon, Blue Danube, was large and cumbersome, being long and wide, and weighed , so only the Royal Air Force (RAF) V-bombers could carry it. In November 1953, the RAF and Royal Navy issued an Operational Requirement, OR.1127, for a smaller, lighter weapon with similar yield that could be carried by tactical aircraft. A second requirement for a light-weight bomb arose with the British Government's decision in July 1954 to proceed with a British hydrogen bomb programme. Hydrogen bombs required an atomic bomb as a primary, and one was incorporated in the British hydrogen bomb design, known as Green Granite. In response, Aldermaston developed a new warhead called Red Beard that was half the size of Blue Danube and weighed one-fifth as much, mainly through innovation in the pit design, principally the use of an \\"air lens\\". Instead of the core being immediately inside the tamper, there was an air gap between them, with the core suspended on thin wires. This allowed the tamper to gain more momentum before striking the core. The concept had been developed by the Manhattan Project in 1945 and 1946, and permitted a reduction in both the size of the core and the amount of explosives required to compress it. The first test on the agenda was therefore of the new Red Beard design. OR.1127 also specified a requirement for the device to have variable yields, which Aldermaston attempted to achieve through the addition of small amounts of thermonuclear material, a process known as \\"boosting\\". A tower was built at Maralinga for a boosted weapon test, in case sufficient lithium deuteride could not be produced in time for the Operation Mosaic G2 test. In the event, it was available, and G2 went ahead as scheduled. Various tests of the effects of nuclear weapons were considered, but only one thought to be worth the effort was a test of a ground burst. These were known to produce more fallout and less effect than air bursts, and had therefore been avoided by the Americans, but such a test might produce useful information that the UK might trade with them. A ground test was therefore included in the schedule. A fourth test was an operational test. While the physics package of Blue Danube had been tested, there had been no test of the device in its operational form, so one was included in the Operation Buffalo program. The interdepartmental Atomic Trials Executive in London, chaired by Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Morgan, assumed responsibility for both Operation Mosaic and Operation Buffalo, sitting as the Mosaic Executive (Mosex) or Buffalo Executive (Buffalex) as appropriate. Sir William Penney was appointed scientific director for Operation Buffalo, with Roy Pilgrim, the head of Aldermaston's Trials Division, as his deputy. Group Captain Cecil (Ginger) Weir was appointed Task Force Commander. Planning was completed by June 1956. Except for the air drop, all tests were scheduled for 07:00 Central Standard Time. About 1,350 personnel would be present, including 200 scientists from Aldermaston and Harwell, 70 from other UK departments, 50 Canadians and 30 Australians. There would be 500 RAF and RAAF personnel, and 250 Australian Army servicemen to run the camp. Observers would include politicians, journalists, and six American officials, including Major General Leland S. Stranathan from the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Alvin C. Graves from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Frank H. Shelton from Sandia Laboratories and Brigadier General John G. Shinkle from the White Sands Missile Range. =One Tree= A DC3 lands at the airstrip at Maralinga The first test, codenamed One Tree, was a tower-mounted test of Red Beard, scheduled for 12 September. This was the main test to which the media were invited. Butement, Dwyer, Martin and Titterton from the AWTSC were present, and Beale arrived from Canberra with a delegation of 26 politicians, but weather conditions were unfavourable, and the test had to be postponed. The schedule was revised to allow for a morning (07:00) or evening (17:00) test, and after a few days of unfavourable weather it was rescheduled for 23 September. Once again the politicians arrived but returned disappointed. This put Penney under great pressure. On the one hand, if Maralinga was to be used for many years then riding roughshod over Australian concerns about safety at an early date was inadvisable; on the other, there was the urgent need to test Red Beard in time for the upcoming Operation Grapple, the test of a British hydrogen bomb. Whether Buffalo or Grapple was more important was the subject of debate in the UK between Willis Jackson, who argued for Buffalo, and Bill Cook, who argued for Grapple. Jackson's view prevailed; Grapple would be postponed if need be. Australian journalists were critical of the cancellations. There were allegations that the delays had caused the deaths of cattle that had contracted Redwater fever while waiting for a ship that was delayed due to the tests, and there were concerns about the cost of delays, said to be up to AU ¬£10,000 per postponement, and whether Maralinga was a suitable site after all. Finally, the test was carried out at 17:00 on 27 September without the politicians. Conditions were suitable but \\"by no means ideal\\". It would have been preferable if the wind had more southerly, and there had been more wind shear above . The prevailing conditions meant that the fallout pattern would be long and narrow, and more concentrated over the nearest town in its path, which was Coober Pedy, away. Some observers were surprised that the detonation seemed to be silent; the sound wave arrived a few seconds later. The yield was estimated at . The cloud rose to , much higher than expected. After about eight minutes, a Canberra bomber flew through the cloud to collect samples. Along with a secondary cloud that formed between , it drifted eastward. The main cloud crossed the east coast at about 11:00 on 28 September, followed by the secondary between 12 and 18 hours later. Rain on 29 September deposited some fallout between Brisbane in Queensland and Lismore in New South Wales. = Marcoo = John L Stanier at Maralinga in protective clothing with a camera protected in a special plastic cover The next test was Marcoo, a ground test using a Blue Danube with a low- yield core. In the hope that sharing the results might lead to fuller cooperation, the test had been discussed with the Americans by the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington, D.C., and they had been sufficiently interested to offer the use of American instrumentation and personnel. Fearful of giving away too much information, the British accepted the instrumentation only. The weapon was lowered into a concrete pit. This time the weather was good, but the aircraft bringing Beale and the politicians was delayed by fog in Canberra. It arrived at Maralinga at 15:40, and they had to be rushed to the viewing platform on Observation hill. The bomb was detonated precisely on time, at 16:30, with a yield of . It left a crater wide and deep. The fallout crossed the east coast 25 to 30 hours after the detonation. = Kite = Originally the air drop test was supposed to be the last, but Penney now decided to swap the last two tests, making the air drop the third test. The air drop was the most difficult test, as the worst-case scenario involved the radar fuses failing and the bomb detonating on impact with the ground, which would result in severe fallout. The RAF therefore conducted a series of practice drops with high explosive bombs. In the end, in view of the AWTSC's concerns about the dangers of a test, a low-yield Blue Danube core with less fissile material was substituted, reducing the yield to . Titterton and Dwyer were on hand for the shot. On 11 October 1956, Valiant B.1 WZ366 of No. 49 Squadron RAF became the first RAF aircraft to drop a live atomic bomb. It fell about left and short of the target, detonating at a height of at 15:27. The yield was . The pilot, Squadron Leader Edwin Flavell, and the bomb aimer, Flight Lieutenant Eric Stacey, were awarded the Air Force Cross. Fallout was minimal. Two clouds formed, a low-level one at about that dropped all its radioactive material inside the prohibited area, and a high-level one at that deposited a negligible amount of fallout over South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. = Breakaway = The final test, Breakaway, was of a boosted Red Beard. The shot was conducted from a tower. Once again there were delays due to unfavourable weather that pushed it back from 18 to 22 October. It was detonated at 00:05 on 22 October, with a yield of about . As on previous tests, the fallout was measured using sticky paper, air sampling devices, and water sampled from rainfall and reservoirs.Atomic Weapons Tests ‚Äì Buffalo 1, 2, 3 and 4 in: This time the cloud was tracked with the help of a Trans Australia Airlines (TAA) Douglas DC-4 diverted from its flight path. The cloud reached but soon became widely dispersed between Darwin in the Northern Territory and Newcastle in New South Wales. The highest reading recorded by the ground survey was at Ingomar, South Australia, about from the test site. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\\" + United Kingdom's Buffalo series tests and detonations - !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Name !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Date + time (UTC) !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Local time !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Location !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Elevation + height !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Delivery !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Purpose !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Device !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Yield !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" References - ! 1/One Tree  07:30 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 17:00 ACST (9.5 hrs) Maralinga Range, SA  + Tower Weapons development Red Beard style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   - ! 2/Marcoo  07:00 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 16:30 ACST (9.5 hrs) Maralinga Range, SA  + Dry surface Weapon effect Blue Danube style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   - ! 3/Kite  05:57 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 15:27 ACST (9.5 hrs) Maralinga Range, SA  + Air drop Weapons development Blue Danube style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   - ! 4/Breakaway  14:35 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 00:05 ACST (9.5 hrs) Maralinga Range, SA  + Tower Weapons development Red Beard style=\\"text- align:center;\\"   }  Operation Antler  = Planning and purpose = The July 1956 Suez Crisis brought US-UK relations to a low ebb, rendering the prospect of the use of US facilities in the near future remote. On 20 September 1956, the UK High Commissioner informed Menzies of the UK's intention to continue minor trials in March through October 1957, with another major test series in September and October. The main implication was that the range would be in use for most of the year. A minimum of 228 personnel would be required all year round, rising to 354 from March to July, and 400 from July to October. The codename Sapphire was initially allocated to the 1957 test series, but the RAF complained that that codename had already been allocated to the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire aircraft engine. The name was briefly changed to Volcano until the Australians objected, and then to Antler. Maralinga village from the north-east At the AWTSC meeting on 7 December 1956, Martin suggested that the committee be reconstituted. A three-person Maralinga Safety Committee chaired by Titterton, with Dwyer and D. J. Stevens from the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory as its other members, would be responsible for the safety of nuclear weapons tests, while a National Radiation Advisory Committee (NRAC) consider public health more generally. This reflected growing disquiet among the scientific community and the public at large over the effects of all atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, not just those in Australia, and growing calls for a test ban. Nonetheless, Operation Buffalo had attracted little international attention. The British Government rejected calls for a moratorium on testing, and announced at the US-UK talks in Bermuda in March 1957 that it would press on with the Operation Grapple hydrogen bomb tests. Martin's proposal was accepted, and the composition of the new NRAC was announced on 7 July 1957.The committee consisted of Sir MacFarlane Burnet (Director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research); Professor Sydney Sunderland (University of Melbourne); Professor Philip Baxter (Australian Atomic Energy Commission); Sir Leslie Martin (University of Melbourne); Professor Ernest Titterton (Australian National University); Dr. W. P. Holman (Cancer Institute Board); Dr. D. A. Gill (CSIRO); Dr. D. J. Stevens (Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory); and Dr. J. C. Bower, secretary. John Moroney was appointed secretary of both committees. The AWTSC continued to report to the Minister of Supply, while the NRAC reported directly to the Prime Minister. The first round of Operation Grapple tests was unsuccessful in demonstrating a working hydrogen bomb design. This left plans for Operation Antler in disarray. By mid-June 1957, proposals for Antler included up to seven tests: of a surface-to-air warhead called Blue Fox, a small warhead called Pixie, four different versions of Red Beard, and a round designed to test the principle of radiation implosion. Initially it was planned to test Blue Fox (later renamed Indigo Hammer) in both boosted and unboosted form, but the disappointing results of boosting thus far meant that the benefit of boosting would be too small to warrant it, and this version was discarded. Pixie was an even smaller, lightweight () warhead with a plutonium core under consideration for use with the Royal Navy's Seaslug missile. Its drawback was that it required enough plutonium to build two Red Beards, and plutonium was scarce and expensive. In February 1957, the Australian authorities were notified of plans for six tests, including three using balloons, with maximum yields of up to . The UK had considerable experience with barrage balloons during the Second World War but the proposed use of balloons to carry warheads to a higher altitude than achievable with a tower was an innovation for Operation Antler. Use of balloons did away with the engineering effort to build towers, and allowed a test site to be re-used, saving on the effort to construct instrumentation sites and lay cables. Most importantly, whereas low-level detonations sucked up contaminated radioactive dirt from the ground and the vaporised tower, a high-altitude detonation created fallout only from the bomb itself, and were therefore much cleaner. While accepting this point, the AWTSC was apprehensive about the consequences of a runaway balloon carrying a live atomic bomb. Bill Saxby and J. T. Tomblin from Aldermaston and an RAF balloon expert visited the Nevada Test Site to observe the work Americans were doing with balloons, and it was suggested that Titterton should also visit Nevada. Safety procedures were developed that included, in an extreme circumstance, shooting down the balloons. Titterton and Beale then accepted the use of balloons. In July 1957, the Australian Government was informed of the UK authorities' decision to limit Operation Antler to just three tests. There would be two tower tests of and , codenamed Tadje and Biak respectively, and only one balloon test, a test codenamed Taranaki. Helping the Pixie test (which became known as Tadje) remain on the schedule was the deletion of Red Beard tests. It was decided that the third test would be of a Red Beard with a composite uranium-plutonium core, which had not yet been tested, while the pure plutonium Red Beard would go into production without further testing. Atomic test site at Maralinga ‚Äì Workshops Charles Adams was appointed the test director, with J. A. T. Dawson as his deputy, and J. T. Tomblin as the superintendent. Air Commodore W. P. Sutcliffe commanded the services, with Group Captain Hugh Disney in charge of the RAF component. This was by far the largest of the three service components, with 31 aircraft and about 700 men, including a 70-man balloon detachment. Most of the aircraft were based at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide, although the Avro Shackletons were based at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth in Western Australia. There were 170 men in 22 scientific groups, including 39 Australians and 17 Canadians. Another 450 Australian and British personnel formed the Maralinga Range Support Unit (MARSU) under the command of Colonel R. Durance from the Australian Army. He was succeeded by Colonel G. D. Solomon in 1959, Colonel J. K. Lynch in 1961, Colonel W. G. Henderson in 1962, Colonel A. F. Swinburne in 1963, and Colonel J. G. Ochiltree in 1964. Test procedures were streamlined based on the experience in Operation Buffalo so that it took six hours to set up a tower test and eight for a balloon test. This allowed the testers to take advantage of transient but suitable weather conditions. Invitations to send observers were sent out to all nations with defence cooperation agreements with Britain, which included NATO countries, and fourteen accepted. Australia would send 24 observers, along with Beale's party of 20 parliamentarians. A media contingent of 20 was also accommodated. =Tadje= The Tadje test was scheduled for 12 September 1957, but was postponed to 13 and then 14 September due to the weather. Firing occurred at 14:35 on 14 September, in weather conditions that were almost ideal. The yield was about as expected. The cloud rose to , a little higher than predicted, and headed in a northerly direction. The Tadje test used cobalt-60 pellets as a \\"tracer\\" for determining yield. This fuelled rumours that Britain had been developing a cobalt bomb. The Range staff found the pellets scattered over the landscape. They had not been informed of its use, and their nature was discovered only by accident by Harry Turner, the Australian Health Physics Representative (AHPR). The only member of the AWTSC informed about the decision to use cobalt was Titterton, who did not inform the other members or Turner. Personnel handling these pellets were exposed to the active cobalt-60. =Biak= The Biak test was scheduled for the following week, 21 September, but rain was forecast and the AWTSC cancelled the detonation. The meteorologists predicted a short break in the weather the following day, but with morning fog until 10:00. The fog cleared up by around 03:30. It was decided to detonate at 10:00 despite forecasts that some fallout would be deposited on the Taranaki test site. The yield was around as expected, but the cloud rose much higher: instead of the forecast , with a secondary cloud forming at . Weather conditions were good, but as feared, fallout was deposited on the Taranaki site. =Taranaki= While Tadje and Biak were fired from towers, Taranaki was the balloon test. A contract was let for balloons, but it soon became clear that they could not be produced in time, so balloons were substituted, of a type used by the Blue Joker project. These were capable of bearing loads of up to in winds of up to , but three were required to lift a bomb aloft instead of two. Field trials were held at RAF Cardington in Bedfordshire in February 1957. Twelve were shipped to Maralinga, however inflated balloons were not kept in hangars as they had been at Cardington, but moored in the open. On 4 September a storm struck Maralinga, with lightning and wind gusts of up to , and three balloons were ignited and completely destroyed. Adams requested that another balloon and spare rigging be despatched from the UK. Taranaki was tentatively scheduled for 7 October, but high upper-level winds caused a postponement. It was eventually decided to fire at 16:15 on 9 October. The yield was around , somewhat higher than expected, but the cloud rose to with a secondary cloud forming at , which was much lower than the expected. Since the Australian Government had not set limits on fallout, the AWTSC accepted the recommendations of the NRAC. The result was that the permissible limits were double that of those set for the Operation Buffalo tests. As a result of the balloon detonation, the fireball did not touch the ground, and fallout was limited in both volume and extent. The use of balloons was thus revealed to be far more difficult than anticipated, but the anticipated advantages were realised, and balloons would subsequently be used successfully in the Operation Grapple tests on Christmas Island in the Pacific. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" text-align: center;\\" + United Kingdom's Antler series tests and detonations - !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Name !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Date + time (UTC) !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Local time zone !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Location !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Elevation + height !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Delivery !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Purpose !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" Device !style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" Yield !style=\\"background:#efefef;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" References - ! 1/Tadje  05:05 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 14:35 ACST (9.5 hrs) Maralinga Range, SA  + Tower Weapons development Pixie style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   - ! 2/Biak  00:30 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 10:00 ACST (9.5 hrs) Maralinga Range, SA  + Tower Weapons development Indigo Hammer style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   - ! 3/Taranaki  06:45 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 16:15 ACST (9.5 hrs) Maralinga Range, SA  + Balloon Weapons development Red Beard style=\\"text-align:center;\\"   } Minor trials Map of the Maralinga site, with major test areas (blue) and minor trials areas (red) In addition to the major tests, some 550 minor trials were also carried out between 1953 and 1963. These experiments were subcritical tests involving testing of nuclear weapons or their components, but not nuclear explosions. The four series of minor trials were codenamed Kittens, Tims, Rats and Vixens, and involved experiments with plutonium, uranium, polonium and beryllium. They were called \\"Minor Trials\\" until October 1958, when they were renamed \\"Assessment Tests\\" The name change were made in the wake of the international moratorium on nuclear testing, which began on 31 October 1958. It was feared that the term \\"minor trial\\" might connote that they were small nuclear explosions. The position of the British Government was that the minor trials were not covered by the moratorium, a view supported by the Americans, who continued their own program. Nonetheless, the British Government suspended all testing at Maralinga, including the minor trials. The new name lasted only until December 1959 before it was changed again to the \\"Maralinga Experimental Programme\\", as the term \\"test\\" was still considered to be too evocative of a nuclear test. Although the major tests were carried out with publicity, the conduct of the minor trials were more secretive, especially after 1958, as the British Government wished to avoid publicity during the talks in Geneva that led to the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The minor trials were planned and carried out by the UK authorities with little or no Australian involvement other than logistical support. The British Government submitted proposals for trials to the AWTSC, but its role was limited to advising the Australian Government whether to approve a series of tests; unlike the major tests it had no right to veto a specific minor trial. After 1960, proposals also had to be referred to Martin in his role as the Australian Defence Scientific Advisor. Radiological safety was the responsibility of the AHPR. Ultimately, the minor trials had far greater long- term environmental impact than the major tests, although these effects were limited to the range areas. =Kittens= Nuclear weapons use a neutron initiator, a neutron source capable of producing a burst of neutrons in order to \\"kick-start\\" the nuclear chain reaction at the optimal moment. These worked by mixing polonium-210 and beryllium. Polonium-210 is an alpha particle emitter with a half-life of 138 days. Alpha particles from the polonium caused the beryllium to emit neutrons. The Kitten trials were experiments conducted as part of the development of the neutron initiators. Five tests were conducted at the K site at Emu Field, about from the Operation Totem test site on 26 and 30 September and 6, 14 and 17 October 1953. These experiments dispersed about of beryllium and of polonium-210 into the surrounding area. Most of the contamination was within a radius, with some debris being thrown up to away. All contamination was within the restricted area. Kittens and Tim Operation ‚Äì 43 Mile Camp ‚Äì Instrumentation From these tests an improved initiator design emerged that was smaller and simpler, which the scientists were eager to test. A site in the UK would save time and money, although Omond Solandt raised the possibility of using one in Alberta in Canada. Consideration was given to using the range on Foulness Island, which was used by the AWRE for testing conventional explosive components of nuclear weapons, but on 7 April 1954 the Lord President of the Council, Marquess of Salisbury informed the House of Lords that at Foulness, \\"no nuclear explosions have been or will be made, nor will experiments be made with fission products or any other hazardous radioactive material.\\" While no experiments were carried out at Foulness with radioactive material, experiments were conducted with explosives and beryllium in 1962 and 1963. An alternative considered was Wick in Scotland. Contamination there could be blown out to sea, but the site was otherwise far from ideal. The weather there was generally wet, and the high humidity would interfere with experimental apparatus. Moreover, although downwind contamination would be acceptable, the local authorities could not be reassured that it would be zero. Lieutenant Colonel K. Stewart noted that \\"I doubt if the people owning the estates in Scotland would look on that with very great favour. They are interested in pheasants and deer in Scotland.\\" The dry weather and isolation of Maralinga provided a better option. The December 1952 aide-m√©moire covering Operation Totem made no mention of minor trials, and they came to the notice of Australian authorities only when Australian assistance was requested in preparing the site, but Australian concurrence was sought for all subsequent trials. The Wilson mission requested that in addition to conducting major atomic tests, the UK could conduct a series of Kitten trials as part of Operation Buffalo. The Australians asked for details, and in response Aldermaston provided a comprehensive report on The Scope and Radiological Hazards of Kittens in February 1955. This was referred to Martin for comment. He could see no issues with the proposed tests, and they were approved by the AWTSC. A Kitten test site was established at Naya, east of the main Maralinga range. A public announcement of the Kitten trials was issued in the UK on 25 February 1955 and in Australia the following day. Kittens and Tim Operation ‚Äì 43 Mile Camp ‚Äì Trials areaSix Kitten tests were carried out at Naya in March 1956. Thereafter, they became a regular part of the testing program, with 21 more tests carried out in 1957, 20 in 1959, and 47 in 1960 and 1961, after which they were discontinued owing to the development of external neutron generators. Kitten experiments at Naya dispersed of polonium-210, of beryllium and of natural and depleted uranium. =Tims= Tim experiments were concerned with the measurement of how the core of a nuclear weapon was compressed by the shock wave of the high explosive component. The passage of the shock wave through the assembly was measured and recorded using detectors and high-speed photography. Tim tests used real nuclear weapon assemblies, but cores of natural or depleted uranium, which is chemically identical to highly enriched uranium but not fissile, and only feebly radioactive. They took place from 1955 to 1963, and involved 321 trials with uranium and beryllium tampers at the Naya and Kuli areas at Maralinga. Twelve of the Tim tests at the TM100 and TM101 areas involved studies of plutonium compression. These experiments used and dispersed of beryllium, of natural uranium, of uranium-238 and about 1.2 kg of plutonium about the test sites. =Rats= Rat trials also investigated the properties of shock waves. They had the same objectives as the Tims, and differed only in the way that measurements were carried out. Instead of using external sensors, the Rats employed an intense but short-lived gamma ray source the size of a pea that was placed inside the assembly. X-ray detectors gave a picture of the progress of the explosion from the inside. Between 1956 and 1960, 125 Rat trials took place at the Naya and Dobo areas at Maralinga. The Rat tests used of uranium-238; of scandium-46, a beta and gamma emitter with a radioactive half- life of 83.8 days; of polonium-210, with a half-life of 138 days; and of lead-212, a beta emitter with a half-life of 10.6 hours. With such short lifetimes, these soon decayed away to negligible amounts. =Vixens= Vixen trials involved safety testing. They were about assuring that the core of a nuclear weapon would not accidentally undergo criticality in the event of a fire or unintended crash. These were messy, for a successful test subjected the core to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. These tests sometimes involved some yield from fission, but in every case this was less than the yield from the weapon's conventional explosive component. The British Government's position was that so long as the nuclear explosion component was less than there was no violation of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was then under discussion, but no such limit was agreed upon. While the AWTSC could determine whether there were public health and safety issues with a test, it could not assess whether there were political issues. However, after some consideration, the Australian Government did approve the proposed Vixen test program. Kittens and Tim Operation ‚Äì 43 Mile Camp ‚Äì Trials area ‚Äì setting up instrumentation Some 31 Vixen A trials were conducted in the Wewak area at Maralinga between 1959 and 1961 that investigated the effects of an accidental fire on a nuclear weapon, and involved a total of about of natural and depleted uranium, 0.98 kg of plutonium of which 0.58 kg was dispersed, of polonium-210 and of actinium-227. Balloons were used to carry instruments aloft and take samples. There were three types of Vixen A experiments: combustion in a petrol fire; combustion in an electric furnace; and dispersion by detonation of a nuclear bomb's high explosive components. The petrol fire tests were conducted using a chimney tall on a base, and generated temperatures ranging from for uranium and beryllium and for plutonium. The electric furnace tests were only used for tests with uranium, and involved temperatures ranging from . The Vixen B experimental tests used explosives to blow up nuclear warheads containing plutonium to simulate what would happen in an air crash. In total, twelve Vixen B were conducted at the Taranaki site in 1960, 1961 and 1963, resulting in it becoming the most contaminated site at Maralinga. The tests were conducted on steel structures known as feather beds. The tests produced \\"jets of molten, burning plutonium extending hundreds of feet into the air.\\" The damage to the feather beds and their concrete stands was much greater than anticipated, and a new feather bed was used for each round. At the conclusion of each, all the debris was buried in nearby pits. Eventually there were 21 pits containing of material contaminated with 20 kg of plutonium. Another 2 kg of plutonium was scattered about the test site. Plutonium is not particularly dangerous externally as it emits alpha particles which are stopped by of air, or the dead layer of skin cells on the body, and is not a very intensive source of radiation, due to its long half-life of 24,000 years. It is dangerous when it enters the body, in the worst case by breathing and lodging in the lungs, and therefore tiny particles, often the result of such explosion testing, are the worst threat. The extreme biological persistence of plutonium's radioactive contamination and the cancer threat posed by alpha radiation occurring internally together establish plutonium's dangers. During the Operation Antler trials, the British Government had given the AWTSC reassurances that safety measures were in place to prevent balloons from breaking loose. Despite this, two balloons broke free during a squall on 22 July 1959. One was subsequently recovered but the other was not. A board of inquiry was held, but an even more embarrassing incident occurred on the night of 23/24 September 1960, when seven of the eight balloons being readied for experiments broke free of their moorings during a thunderstorm. Five were recovered on the range on 27 September, but two were lost and drifted further afield, one being recovered near Cobar in New South Wales on 24 September and the other around Hungerford in New South Wales, which was not located until 1 October. Titterton wrote a critical letter to the AWRE. It was clear that the procedures to prevent balloon escapes had been inadequate and the self- destruction devices were unreliable. =Fallout= In the late 1950s, Hedley Marston's research into nuclear fallout from the Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the AWTSC, resulting in one of the more memorable feuds in Australian science. Marston was the head of the Division of Biology and General Nutrition at the CSIRO, and was commissioned by the AWTSC to study the concentrations of iodine-131 in the thyroids of sheep and cattle. A 1954 American report assessed that there was no public health danger, but the AWTSC wanted to be able to monitor the Australian situation. Surveys started before the tests at Maralinga commenced in order to establish a baseline. Marston's results indicated a rise in iodine-131 due to Operation Mosaic. It was not enough to pose a public health hazard‚Äîhis results indicated that the concentration was about 1 per cent of the acceptable limit‚Äîbut it did indicate that fallout was more widespread than first thought. He then attempted to extrapolate his results to strontium-90, but a valid assessment could not be made in this way, and was therefore no more than speculation. In 1961 the AWTSC published a study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. It did find an increase in strontium-90 in Australia, but it was a quarter of that recorded in the UK. Although fallout from the 1958 Operation Grapple thermonuclear tests was detectable in the UK, none was detected in Australia. Closure Maralinga was conceived as a testing ground where major tests could be conducted annually, but this did not occur, and Operation Antler was the last major test series conducted there. One reason was public sentiment. A 1952 poll indicated that 58 per cent of Australians supported British nuclear testing in Australia, with only 29 per cent against, but support steadily declined, and by 1957 only 37 per cent were in favour, with 49 per cent opposed. This augured poorly for the future of Maralinga should there be a change of government, and the 1961 Australian federal election reduced Menzies' majority to just one seat. The decline in Australian support for testing was part of a worldwide trend that resulted in the moratorium on nuclear testing from November 1958 to September 1961. Maralinga was now redundant, as the Australian Government's restriction on testing thermonuclear weapons had led to the development of the Christmas Island test site, where there was no such restriction, and its favourable winds carried fallout away. With the 1958 US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement, Britain also gained access to the Nevada Test Site, where the first British major test took place underground on 1 March 1962, but there was no certainty that Nevada would be available in the future. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty banned atmospheric testing, and no site was located at the Maralinga Range for underground testing; the nearest suitable site was on Aboriginal land away. After 1963, Maralinga was placed on caretaker status, and although there was some discussion about conducting minor trials in 1966, in view of the fact that the 1956 Memorandum of Arrangements was due to expire in March of that year, the British Government decided that it would not seek to extend or renew the agreement.A formal memorandum on the termination of the 1956 Memorandum of Arrangements was signed on 23 September 1967, and the UK was released from most liabilities and responsibilities on 21 December 1967. In December 1968, the Minister for Defence revoked the declaration of Maralinga as a prohibited area under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952. On 31 August 1972, the Minister for Supply removed the restrictions on most of the Maralinga Prohibited Area, retaining only a strip that became part of the new Woomera Prohibited Area. Legacy Clean up operations commenced at Maralinga with Operation Clean Up in 1963 and Operation Hercules in 1964. These involved the removal of major hazards to permit entry to the test sites. A major clean up operation codenamed Operation Brumby was conducted in 1967. Attempts were made to dilute the concentration of radioactive material by turning over and mixing the surface soil. Highly contaminated soil from Wewak was buried in the Marcoo crater, and the debris pits were capped. Over time, the short-lived isotopes decayed away, leaving plutonium, with its half-life of 24,100 years, as the main radioactive hazard. In January 1979, the British Government agreed to the \\"repatriation\\" of recoverable plutonium that had been buried at Maralinga. Souvenir necktie for staff of Maralinga In 1984, the Minister for Resources and Energy established the Kerr Committee on 15 May 1984 to review fallout from the British nuclear tests in Australia. After receiving the report, and having discussions with John Symonds, who was commissioned to write an official history of the British nuclear tests, he decided to convene a royal commission into them. The McClelland Royal Commission delivered its report in late 1985, and found that significant radiation hazards still existed at many of the Maralinga test sites, particularly at Taranaki. The Australian Government accepted the findings of the royal commission, but rejected its recommendations that a Maralinga Commission be created, on the grounds that this was more properly a role for a department of state rather a statutory body, and that the British Government should pay all the costs of a clean up. Instead, Cabinet decided that the British Government should be asked to make a significant contribution. Australian claims were put to the British Government in 1991, and in June 1993, it agreed to contribute an ex gratia sum of UK ¬£20 million towards the costs of rehabilitation of the site. A Technical Assessment Group (TAG) was set up to advise on rehabilitation options, and a much more extensive clean up program was initiated. The TAG Report plan was approved in 1991. Work commenced on site in 1996, and was completed in 2000 at a cost of $108 million. In the worst-contaminated areas, of soil and debris were removed from an area of more than , and buried in trenches. Eleven debris pits were also treated with in situ vitrification. Most of the site (approximately was rendered now safe for unrestricted access and approximately is considered safe for access but not \\"permanent occupancy\\". \\"A term\\", British historian Lorna Arnold noted, \\"that no one would have applied to these regions 30 or 40 years before\\". Nuclear engineer Alan Parkinson observed that \\"an Aboriginal living a semi-traditional lifestyle would receive an effective dose of 5 mSv/a (five times that allowed for a member of the public). Within the 120 km¬≤, the effective dose would be up to 13 times greater.\\" The effectiveness of the cleanup has been disputed on a number of occasions. One author suggests that the resettlement of Aboriginal people and denial of access to their traditional lands \\"contributed significantly to the social disintegration which characterises the community to this day. Petrol sniffing, juvenile crime, alcoholism and chronic friction between residents and the South Australian police have become facts of life.\\" In 1994, the Australian Government reached a compensation settlement with the traditional owners, Maralinga Tjarutja, which resulted in the payment of $13.5 million in settlement of all claims in relation to the nuclear testing. Most of the land was handed back in 2009; full handover was marked with a ceremony on 5 November 2014. A Department of Veterans' Affairs study concluded that \\"the doses received by Australian participants were small. ... Only 2% of participants received more than the current Australian annual dose limit for occupationally exposed persons (20 mSv).\\" However, such findings are contested. Australian servicemen were ordered to: repeatedly fly through the mushroom clouds from atomic explosions, without protection; and to march into ground zero immediately after bomb detonation. Airborne drifts of radioactive material resulted in \\"radioactive rain\\" being dropped on Brisbane and Queensland country areas. A 1999 study for the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association found that 30 per cent of involved veterans had died, mostly in their fifties, from cancers. In 2001, Sue Rabbit Roff, a researcher from the University of Dundee, uncovered documentary evidence that troops had been ordered to run, walk and crawl across areas contaminated by the Buffalo tests in the days immediately following the detonations; a fact that the British Government later admitted. Roff stated that \\"it puts the lie to the British Government's claim that they never used humans for guinea pig-type experiments in nuclear weapons trials in Australia.\\" Successive Australian Governments failed to compensate servicemen who contracted cancers following exposure to radiation at Maralinga. However, after a British decision in 1988 to compensate its own servicemen, the Australian Government negotiated compensation for several Australian servicemen suffering from two specific conditions, leukaemia (except lymphatic leukemia) and the rare blood disorder multiple myeloma. Media coverage According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga tests were a striking example of what can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that a government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission. In June 1993, New Scientist journalist Ian Anderson wrote an article entitled \\"Britain's dirty deeds at Maralinga\\" and several related articles. They are a detailed analysis of the legacy of Vixen B and the Australian Government's prolonged negotiations with the United Kingdom on cleaning up Maralinga and sharing the cost of \\"safe-sealing\\" waste plutonium. In 1993, Anderson won two Michael Daley Awards for his Maralinga articles. Maralinga: Australia's Nuclear Waste Cover-up is a book by Alan Parkinson that was published in 2007. In it he claimed that the clean-up of Maralinga in the late 1990s was compromised by cost-cutting, and simply involved dumping hazardous radioactive debris in shallow holes in the ground. He stated that \\"what was done at Maralinga was a cheap and nasty solution that wouldn't be adopted on white-fellas land.\\"  Representations in the arts  * Ground Zero (1987) is an Australian drama-thriller about a cinematographer (played by Colin Friels) who, prompted by curiosity about some old film footage taken by his father, embarks on a quest to uncover the truth about the tests. It also stars actors Jack Thompson and Indigenous activist Burnum Burnum. * The Career Highlights of the Mamu is an Australian play by Trevor Jamieson and Scott Rankin, performed at the Adelaide Festival in February‚ÄìMarch 2002. The play tells the story of the Tjuntjuntjara Aboriginal people, who lived in the desert country of South Australia and Western Australia, and their experience with British nuclear testing at Maralinga and Emu Field. Tribal elders describe being moved out of the area, and the death and illness of their people when they attempted to return to their contaminated homelands. * Maralinga: The Anangu Story (2009), by the Yalata & Oak Valley Communities with Christobel Mattingley, is an information book about the history and culture of the region, the controversy and its original owners. Aimed at young people, the book was awarded a silver Honour medal in 2010 by the Children's Book Council of Australia. Judy Nunn used the events at Maralinga as a backdrop for her novel Maralinga (2009). * Operation Buffalo, a May 2020 Australian television drama series screen on ABC, is inspired by events of British nuclear bomb tests at Maralinga. The story does not stick to factual events, but mixes satire, farce, nostalgia and drama, at the same time representing aspects of historical fact, the colonial tensions between the British and Australian governments and a serious representation of the treatment of the Aboriginal people in the area. * Maralinga Tjarutja, a May 2020 television documentary film directed by Larissa Behrendt and made by Blackfella Films for ABC Television, tells the story of the people of Maralinga. It was deliberately broadcast around the same time that the drama series Operation Buffalo was on, to give voice to the Indigenous people of the area and show how it disrupted their lives. Screenhub gave it 4.5 stars, calling it an \\"excellent documentary\\". The film shows the resilience of the Maralinga Tjarutja people, in which the elders \\"reveal a perspective of deep time and an understanding of place that generates respect for the sacredness of both\\", their ancestors having lived in the area for millennia. Despite the callous disregard for their occupation of the land shown by the British and Australians involved in the testing, the people have continued to fight for their rights to look after the contaminated land. =Music= * The Australian rock band Midnight Oil recorded a song about the tests called \\"Maralinga\\" on their 1982 LP 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. *Paul Kelly's \\"Maralinga (Rainy Land)\\" is about the effects of British nuclear tests on the Maralinga Tjarutja. *\\"After Maralinga\\" by the British band Latin Quarter is about the aftermath of the nuclear tests.

Her strongest memories are of Cordelia, who was the leader of a trio of girls who were both very cruel and very kind to her in ways that tint Elaine's perceptions of relationships and her world ‚Äî not to mention her art ‚Äî into her middle years. The novel unfolds in mid-20th century Canada, from World War II to the late 1980s, and includes a look at many of the cultural elements of that time period, including feminism and various modern art movements. The book was a finalist for the 1988 Governor General's Award and for the 1989 Booker Prize.  Explanation of the title  Elaine and her brother play marbles as children; Elaine keeps a prized possession, a cat's eye marble, in her childhood plastic red purse. The cat's eye later appears as a common motif in Elaine's paintings, linked with those she perceived to be an ally, although she does not remember why it is associated with those feelings. Elaine rediscovers the red purse years later, and as she looks through it, she regains all the memories she had lost: \\"her life entire\\".Atwood, Margaret. Cat's Eye : 420  Plot summary  After being lured back to her childhood home of Toronto for a retrospective show of her art, Elaine reminisces about her childhood. At the age of eight she becomes friends with Carol and Grace, and, through their eyes, realises that her atypical background of constant travel with her entomologist father and independent mother has left her ill- equipped for conventional expectations of femininity. Although initially awkward and naive of childhood politics and social structure, Elaine is accepted, even admired by her new friends. Her lifestyle, even now, is exotic to the others. Elaine, after fantasizing about having girl friends during her nomadic brief existence, begins to settle in and enjoy her new life and new school. After her first full year of attending traditional grade school, during her summer break, her parents return her to their previous life of travel and insect exploration. After a four-month absence, Elaine returns home to her friends for the next school year. Upon her return, Elaine finds the dynamic of her group has been altered with the addition of the new girl, Cordelia. Elaine is first drawn in by Cordelia but after a period, sensing her inability to recognize the cruelty, Elaine is bullied by the three girls, her supposed \\"best friends.\\" After mostly destroying any self-esteem Elaine has developed in her new life, she gradually becomes depressed and feels helpless unable to stand up to them or rescue herself. She continually complies with the demeaning demands of the group and considers the worst transgression she could ever commit would be to tattle on her \\"friends,\\" a sick loyalty Cordelia nurtures and feeds. Elaine, despite her parents' concern, even accompanies Grace and her family to their church, which, to her amazement and curiosity, is Elaine's first exposure to mainstream religion. Her newly found faith is tested when she continues to be poorly treated, even by Grace's mother. The bullying escalates that winter when the girls throw Elaine's hat into a ravine and then abandon her to climb out of the ravine river water, half-frozen. On the brink of panic, Elaine sees a vision of the Virgin Mary, whom she learned about in Grace's church. In a haze, an illusion of the Virgin guides Elaine to safety. Afterward, realizing she allowed herself to be a victim all along, Elaine is finally able to make a break and makes new friends. Later, now in high school, and earlier events somewhat repressed, Elaine reestablishes a friendship with Cordelia but without Carol or Grace, who have both moved out of the area. Elaine is much tougher now than when she was as a child, and the tables turn as she often taunts Cordelia. Cordelia, it appears, is experiencing her own crisis and has trouble applying herself to her studies and begins to act out. Elaine feels a mix of triumph, contempt and pity when she realizes she has outgrown Cordelia. She is relieved that she can no longer be manipulated by the girl who essentially was the leader and the number one bully during their childhood. Her last exchanges with Cordelia in high school are bleak when Elaine sees Cordelia is depressed and her behavior has prevented her from graduating on schedule. After Cordelia is sent to a private school for delinquent girls, the two girls lose touch with one another after high school. Elaine's childhood story is told in the first person narrative in flashbacks with brief snippets from her present adult life. Elaine, working part-time in a diner and attending university, meets with Cordelia after a period of losing touch. Cordelia appears to have regained her former slyness and tells Elaine that instead of attending university, Cordelia has undertaken acting. She subtly brags about her roles in the Shakespearean Festival and invites Elaine to attend one of her performances. After a couple years, Elaine again meets with Cordelia who has completely fallen off the tracks and has been committed to a mental facility by her parents. Overmedicated and desperate, she begs Elaine to help her escape from the hospital. Despite her guilt and latent anger, Elaine refuses to help Cordelia. A few weeks after their meeting, Elaine receives a return-to-sender letter she sent Cordelia in the hospital. It appears Cordelia found a way to escape without Elaine. Not knowing it, this would be Elaine's last time seeing Cordelia. The narrative describes Elaine through early adulthood as an art student and a burgeoning feminist artist, although Elaine's feminist label is media engineered, not self-proclaimed. She begins to find herself and develop her artistic identity, fumbling her way through her art and personal relationships. However, throughout this time, she continues to be haunted by her childhood and has difficulties forming relationships with other women. Although she increasingly becomes a known and influential artist, Elaine is berefted by anger, guilt, confusion and bewilderment of the lasting effects of Cordelia's behavior and her eventual disappearance from Elaine's life. Towards the end of the novel, owing to her retrospective exhibition and her return to Toronto, she eventually faces her past and gets closure.  Themes  Cat's Eye explores the construction of identity; it is written mostly as flashbacks, as Elaine reflects on the forgotten events of her childhood that shaped her personality and struggles to integrate lost aspects of her self. In Elaine's self- portrait, a pier glass reflects three little girls who are not in the painting, demonstrating their simultaneous absence from Elaine's past and their presence in who she has become. Elaine's story is detailed in rich visualizations and descriptions of her art reflecting her childhood influences, not only by the trio of girls, but also by her rootless untraditional upbringing, and relationships with her parents who remain nameless and unidentified throughout the story; her genius brother and his strange ways and fate; her comforting secret alliances with the male gender; kind and stern female teachers; art instructors; peer artists; the media; motherhood and mid-life confrontation of self. The country of Canada itself also has a prominent role that acts as an additional character with her experiences in Toronto. The English monarchy is featured as a vivid childhood influence with a young Queen Elizabeth II's perceived bravery and aplomb after World War II.  Allusions to Atwood's life  Atwood began Cat's Eye in 1964 but put away the novel until the late 1980s. By that time, her daughter was a teenager, and Atwood had had the opportunity to observe the social dynamics of a group of young girls and boys.Cooke, Nathalie. Margaret Atwood: A Critical Companion : 17‚Äì18 The book is sometimes seen as containing autobiographical elements. For example, like Risley, Atwood is the daughter of an entomologist. However, Atwood has rarely, if ever, commented on the similarities directly.  See also  * Southern Ontario Gothic  Further reading  * Brian Busby. Character Parts: Who's Really Who in Canlit.

It is located at 1713 Steeles Avenue East, near the community of Bramalea at Steeles Ave. East and Bramalea Road. Like many other stations on the GO Train network, Bramalea is equipped with parking facilities, elevators for wheelchair access, a station building housing a waiting room and ticket sales, a Ticket Vending Machine, and a bus loop. In addition to the train service during the weekdays, it also features some train-bus services to/from Union Station and a frequent Highway 407 bus serving Highway 407 Bus Terminal, Square One, Sheridan College (Trafalgar Campus) Oakville, McMaster University, and Hamilton. Bramalea was previously the western terminus of all-day weekday train service to/from Union Station on the Georgetown line. Midday service was suspended to facilitate construction on the line. Since midday train service on the Georgetown corridor was first launched in May 2002, GO Transit has hired various contractors to improve the station. First, the station was made wheelchair-accessible by building an additional pedestrian tunnel and a pair of elevators, completed in January 2003. In August of that year, construction began of a new rail platform which was required in order to provide for all-day train service for the station, as the station is located on a busy railway corridor used by Canadian National Railways freight trains bypassing Toronto. To accommodate future increases in ridership, a new 650-space parking lot was opened in June 2005 on the south side of the tracks. GO Transit had also constructed a bus garage at the north- east corner by Steeles Avenue and Bramalea Road. The garage was subsequently removed and replaced with much-needed additional parking spaces in November 2011. A platform extension to allow 12-car trains was completed in early 2017.

Carling Avenue is a major east‚Äìwest arterial road in the west end of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It runs from March Road in Kanata to Bronson Avenue in the Glebe. The road is named for John Carling, founder of Carling Brewery and Conservative MP and Senator, Postmaster General and Minister of Agriculture. Road description It begins at the fringes of the Glebe neighbourhood and runs in a straight direction west until the Ottawa River where it bends north to go around Crystal Bay and Britannia Bay and ends north of Kanata. It used to begin at O'Connor Street, one block east of Bank Street, but the part east of Bronson was renamed Glebe Avenue in the 1970s. It is a four to six-lane principal arterial road for most of its urban length, with a speed limit of . The portion through the Greenbelt and into Kanata is generally a two-lane rural highway (although widening is planned, which would also remove a substandard underpass in the 3700 block about midway between March Road and Moodie Drive), with a speed limit of . In December 2005 one lane in each direction between Booth Street and Cambridge South just before Bronson was converted to a bus-only lane. This very short (roughly 150 m) bus- only section speeds up bus traffic through the Carling/Bronson intersection during rush-hour.

When Lloyd Axworthy resigned his seat in 1979, Westbury ran to succeed him in the riding of Fort Rouge, and defeating New Democrat Vic Savino by 368 votes. For the next two years, Westbury was the only Liberal MLA in the legislature. She was chosen Woman of the Year in Political and Government Affairs in 1979. The Manitoba Liberal Party saw its support decline to historic lows in the early 1980s, and Westbury was defeated by New Democrat Roland Penner by almost 2,000 votes in the provincial election of 1981. She did not seek a return to elected office after this time, but assisted Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs in the election of 1988. Westbury was known as a supporter of the arts within Winnipeg, and worked to make the Legislative Building of Manitoba fully accessible to female members. She was a supporter of the Manitoba Opera Association, as well as the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. When Videon applied to the Community Committee in 1977 to request television recording equipment be allowed, Westbury was quoted as saying \\"I support the idea because the more coverage we have, the more community involvement we can hope for.\\" She died at the Convalescent Home of Winnipeg at the age of 82.

Noffke. To the south it looks out on Strathcona Park while to the east it looks out on the Rideau River. Russia also maintains consulates in Toronto and Montreal. History of the building The site was originally given to the Soviet Union in 1942 and was contained in a large manor that had formerly belonged to J. Fred Booth, son of lumber baron J.R. Booth. This manor had been the site of the marriage of Fred Booth's daughter Lois to Prince Erik of Denmark, son of Prince Valdemar of Denmark. The building was expropriated by the government during the Second World War for use by the Royal Canadian Navy, but was instead handed over to the Soviets to house their growing legation. It was in this building that Igor Gouzenko worked and from where he removed documents before defecting in 1945. On January 1, 1956 a fire broke out on the third floor of the embassy. Embassy employees tried to put it out themselves and did not call the fire department. They were unsuccessful and neighbours soon noticed smoke billowing from the building. When the fire department arrived the Soviets would not let them in, insisting they fight the fire from the sidewalk outside. Ottawa Mayor Charlotte Whitton arrived at the blaze and demanded the fire department be let in, and threatened to have the embassy staff arrested. The dispute between the mayor and the ambassador was mediated by cabinet minister Paul Martin, who had also come to the scene. Eventually, the fire fighters were allowed in, but only after the Soviets had removed large numbers of sensitive documents and equipment. It was too late, however, and the building was gutted.http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/heritage/archives/newton/celebrations/fire_en.html The remains of the manor were demolished and the current stark Classic Soviet style building was erected in its place. After the fire the embassy was relocated to 24 Blackburn Avenue, which housed the office of the Soviet commercial counsellor.https://todayinottawashistory.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/the-soviet- embassy-fire/ The RCMP, then in charge of Canadian security service and in cooperation with MI5, infiltrated the construction site in an attempt to bug the building in an operation that was known as Operation Dew Worm.https://todayinottawashistory.wordpress.com/2015/01/01/the-soviet- embassy-fire/ They concentrated on the northwest corner of the building, the logical site for a communications centre. The Soviets, however, built their communications centre in a sealed chamber elsewhere in the building and the bugs proved useless. With the fall of the Soviet Union the building became the Russian embassy. The massive bust of Lenin was removed from the lobby and soon after the building's exterior was modified to make it less imposing. Jeffrey Delisle espionage case In July 2007, Jeffrey Delisle, a former Sub- Lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Navy walked into the Embassy of Russia in Ottawa and offered to sell secret information to the Russian military intelligence service; the GRU. He eventually passed on sensitive information from the top-secret STONEGHOST intelligence sharing network to Russia. Delisle continued handing over classified information to his GRU handler for 4 more years until December 2011 before being arrested in January 2012.

He has been an assistant director on many films, including Dark City (1998), the Matrix trilogy (1999‚Äì2003) and Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (2002), and made his directorial debut with the 2005 film V for Vendetta to critical acclaim. Since Vendetta he has collaborated with the Wachowskis an additional three times as director on The Invasion (albeit uncredited), Ninja Assassin and Sense8.  Career  He first became involved in the film industry in the late 1980s, acting as production runner or production assistant in a number of small Australian films. In 1991 his role became assistant director, being the third assistant director in another Australian film, The Girl Who Came Late. In 1994 he was the second assistant director in Country Life, a film adaptation based on Michael Blakemore's National Theatre production of Uncle Vanya, which had a much wider audience than his previous affairs. He also acted again as second assistant director in a small Australian television film. McTeigue broke into mainstream Hollywood in 1994 as the second assistant director for No Escape and the big budget film Street Fighter. In 1996 McTeigue again acted as second assistant director on an American television film and a small Australian film being completed that year. In 1997 he was the second assistant director for the WWII film Paradise Road as well as The Well, that year he also worked as first assistant director for the television series Big Sky. The following year he was the second assistant director for the American science-fiction film Dark City as well as the Australian film The Sugar Factory. In 1999 McTeigue was intended to act as second assistant director for The Matrix film until the first assistant director, a friend of McTeigue who told him about the project, had to drop out and The Wachowskis made McTeigue first assistant director. The film was released in 1999 and became a huge success. The following year he acted as first assistant director on the popular Australian film Looking for Alibrandi as well as The Monkey's Mask. In 2000 McTeigue worked with George Lucas and became the first assistant director for Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, which was released in 2002. Following this, he was also the first assistant director for both Matrix sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. In 2005 McTeigue made his directorial debut with V for Vendetta, written and produced by the Wachowskis. After spending so much time on The Matrix film series, they gave the opportunity to McTeigue to direct, first showing him a copy of the Vendetta graphic novel during post-production of The Matrix Revolutions. Warner Bros. expressed dissatisfaction with the way Oliver Hirschbiegel's The Invasion shaped up and brought in James McTeigue for an additional 17 days of filming based on rewrites by the Wachowskis. The film was released in 2007 with the involvement of McTeigue and the Wachowskis being uncredited. In 2008 he did second unit directing work on the Wachowskis' Speed Racer. McTeigue directed Ninja Assassin, produced by the Wachowskis, which was out in 2009. The same year he was said to be directing a reboot of the Superman film series, a rumor that he neither confirmed nor denied, but Warner Bros. ultimately gave the job of rebooting the Superman franchise to Zack Snyder. In 2012, he directed the thriller The Raven, a fictionalized account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe's life, in which the poet and author pursues a serial killer whose murders mirror those in Poe's stories. He partnered again with the Wachowskis to direct the Mexico City, Mumbai and parts of the Reykjavik units on their Netflix science fiction drama Sense8 which debuted in 2015. McTeigue got directing credit in two episodes. Over the years McTeigue has been linked as director of the films Osiris Release, Richard K. Morgan's Altered Carbon, Message From The King, Bloodsport and Alien Sleeper Cell but as of May 2016 none of them have moved forward.

Round Lake itself and the adjoining of old-growth forest were designated a National Natural Landmark in 1973 by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Hubert W. Vogelmann, a professor of botany at the University of Vermont, wrote the evaluationVogelmann, Hubert W.

Vogelmann declined to recommend Green Lake in his recommendation because of its greater development. to the National Park Service that concurred with the recommendation of National Natural Landmark status for the region around Round Lake. Vogelmann's evaluation noted the \\"outstanding virgin mesophytic forest\\" adjoining Round Lake on its southwestern side; this text became part of the citation when the landmark was created. Vogelmann also noted Round Lake's importance as an extremely rare, \\"meromictic\\" lake. It shares this distinction with Green Lake, which lies a few hundred meters to the east.

Plaque recording the status of Round Lake as a National Natural Landmark October view through the old growth forest from the escarpment above Round Lake. The virgin quality of the forest near Round Lake was already considered unusual in 1855, when Ledyard Lincklaen noted that this \\"dense body of woodland had hardly felt the axe.\\" The region of Upstate New York in which Round Lake lies was heavily forested through the 18th Century, but by 1855 the region had largely been deforested to create farmland. In the early 19th Century, Upstate New York was rapidly being settled by European-Americans. Soldiers who had fought in the Revolutionary War had often received land grants in this former Indian territory. Essentially the first act of most settlers was to cut down the primeval forest and to burn the hardwood logs to make potash, which was quite profitable in that era. The land near Round Lake was settled in 1817 by David Collin III. It lies within one mile (1.6 km) of the Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825. It is remarkable that a forest so close to a major transportation route remained nearly untouched throughout the 19th Century. However, for the entire interval between 1817 and the purchase of the land for Green Lakes State Park, most of it was owned by Collin or by his descendants. One of these descendants, Betsy Knapp, wrote a memoir Rocks, Fields and Beauty Forever: One Family's Memories of Fayetteville's Green LakesKnapp, Betsy (1989). Rocks, Fields And Beauty Forever: One Family's Memories of Fayetteville's Green Lakes (privately printed). in 1989. Her memoir makes clear that the land was never clearcut either for lumber or for potash. In essence, the forest was preserved by the Collin family until its purchase for the park in 1928. The old-growth forestlands throughout Green Lakes State Park were extensively surveyed in 2001-2002 by members of the Wildwood Ancient Forest Alliance. Contains links to the individual survey data. The surveys found that there are about of old-growth forest within the park. The surveyors speculated that the paucity of hemlock trees in some areas indicates selective cutting of this species, perhaps for log roads in the mid 19th Century. They nonetheless conclude that \\"Green Lakes State Park is likely the finest old growth forest in central New York.\\" Green Lakes State Park contains particularly old and large examples of tuliptrees, sugar maples, beech, basswood, hemlocks, and white cedars. One particularly impressive grove of trees, lying just southwest of Round Lake, was renamed the Tuliptree Cathedral following the 2001-2002 old-growth surveys. A survey of the heights of especially large trees was reported in 2011; the tallest was . Log of height measurements for about 25 trees; the tallest was 147 feet high. Limnology of Round Lake and Green Lake The lake is deep, which is remarkable given its diameter of . Both Round Lake and Green Lake are meromictic, which means that the bottom waters of the lake are not mixed annually with the surface waters. For both lakes, the waters deeper than are unmixed and essentially devoid of oxygen. Meromictic lakes are quite rare; nearly all lakes undergo mixing of their deep and shallow waters at least once each year. Green Lake in particular has been the subject of a great deal of limnological research. The lakes are meromictic both because of their depth (relative to their diameters) and because there is an influx of mineral-laden groundwater into them; to some extent the lakes are giant mineral springs. The mineral content also accounts for the lakes' greenish appearance at certain times of year, when small particles of calcium carbonate and other minerals precipitate out of the water; these \\"whitings\\" cause the white coating of the lake bottoms that is readily observable at the shoreline. left In addition to the strictly limnological research on the lakes, the sediments at their bottoms are being used to explore the history of the plant and animal life and of the climate around the lake over the last several thousand years (i.e. its paleoclimatology). Because the deep, oxygen-depleted bottoms of the lakes are undisturbed either by annual mixing or by \\"bioturbation\\" (plant growth or movement of worms and other animals), each year's sediments are preserved as distinguishable layers (or varves) that can be dated back in time from the present. There is a distinct change in the color of the varves that occurred around 1800; the lower, older varves are dark brown, and the higher, younger varves are grey. The varves thus record the change in the lakes' environment around 1800, when the primeval forests in the region were replaced by open fields and farmland.

By the time of the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, these ancient communities had been ruled by various empires and included the Babylonian, Persian, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Yemenite Jews. Jews under Islamic rule were given the status of dhimmi, along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups.Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45 Though second-class citizens, these non-Muslim groups were nevertheless accorded certain rights and protections as \\"people of the book\\". During waves of persecution in Medieval Europe, many Jews found refuge in Muslim lands.Lewis 1984 p. 62 For instance, Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula were invited to settle in various parts of the Ottoman Empire, where they would often form a prosperous model minority of merchants acting as intermediaries for their Muslim rulers. Today, Jews residing in Muslim countries have been reduced to a small fraction of their former sizes, with Iran and Turkey being home to the largest remaining Jewish populations. Middle Ages =Muslim conquests= There were, for a long but uncertain period, a significant number of Jews in Arabia. Historians claim that very large numbers of Jews ‚Äì as many as 80,000 ‚Äì arrived after the destruction of the First Temple, to join others already long-established in places such as the oasis of Khaybar as well as the trading colonies in Medina and Mecca (where they had their own cemetery). Another theory posits that these Jews were refugees from Byzantine persecutions. Arab historians mention some 20 Jewish communities, including two of Kohanim.Bernard Lewis, The Crisis of Islam (London, 2003), p. XXVII The Constitution of Medina, written shortly after hijra, addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews \\"will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs\\", and they \\"shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs\\". After the Battle of Badr, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qaynuqa breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as casus belli and besieged the Banu Qaynuqa. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled.Ibn Kathir p. 2 The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the Banu Nadir, accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, Banu Qurayza was eliminated after betraying the Muslims during the Battle of the Trench. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as Banu Awf, Banu Harith, Banu Jusham Banu Alfageer, Banu Najjar, Banu Sa'ida, and Banu Shutayba.Norman A. Stillman: Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World. Brill, Leiden 2010 (also online, with costs)Irvin and Sunquist, History of the World Christian Movement, Vol. 1. Edinburgh, 2001, p. 268 In year 20 of the Muslim era, or the year 641 AD, Muhammad's successor the Caliph Umar decreed that Jews and Christians should be removed from all but the southern and eastern fringes of Arabia‚Äîa decree based on the uttering of the Prophet: \\"Let there not be two religions in Arabia\\". The two populations in question were the Jews of the Khaybar oasis in the north and the Christians of Najran.Bernard Lewis, The Crisis of Islam (London, 2003) p. XXVIIBernard Lewis, The Crisis of Islam (London, 2003), p. XXVIII Only the Red Sea port of Jeddah was permitted as a \\"religious quarantine area\\" and continued to have a small complement of Jewish merchants. =During the Caliphates= A Jew and a Muslim playing chess in 13th century al-Andalus. During the Middle Ages, Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration.Cohen, Mark R. \\"The Neo-Lachrymose Conception of Jewish-Arab History.\\" Tikkun 6.3 (1991) Some historians refer to this time period as the \\"Golden Age\\" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them. In the context of day- to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages. The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the Pact of Umar and the traditional Dhimmi status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century Granada, were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society. Social integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology,Cowling (2005), p. 265 with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule. For example, the vizier of Baghdad entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and Siraf, the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor.Poliakov (1974), pg.68-71 Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace. Leon Poliakov writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force. This, coupled with more intense Christian persecution, encouraged many Jews to migrate to areas newly conquered by Muslims and establish communities there. Although Jewish life improved under Islamic rule, an interfaith utopia did not exist. Jews still experienced persecution. Under Islamic Rule, the Pact of Umar was introduced, which protected the Jews but also established them as inferior. Since the 11th century, there have been instances of pogroms against Jews.The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries Examples include the 1066 Granada massacre, the razing of the entire Jewish quarter in the Andalucian city of Granada.Granada by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906 ed. In North Africa, there were cases of violence against Jews in the Middle Ages, and in other Arab lands including Egypt, Syria and Yemen Beginning in the 15th century, the Moroccan Jewish population was confined to segregated quarters known as mellahs. In cities, these were surrounded by walls and a fortified gateway. Rural mellahs, however, were separate villages inhabited solely by Jews.The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennett The Almohads, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, were far more fundamentalist in outlook than the Almoravides, and they treated the dhimmis harshly. Jews and Christians were expelled from Morocco and Islamic Spain.The Forgotten Refugees Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, some Jews, such as the family of Maimonides, fled south and east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.Sephardim, Jewish Virtual Library, Rebecca WeinerKraemer, Joel L., Moses Maimonides: An Intellectual Portrait in The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides pp. 16-17 (2005) In 1465, Arab mobs in Fez slaughtered thousands of Jews, leaving only 11 alive, after a Jewish deputy vizier treated a Muslim woman in an offensive manner. The killings touched off a wave of similar massacres throughout Morocco.Gerber (1986), p. 84Jews kicked out of Arab Countries Part 2: The Persecution of Jews prior to 1948, Historical Society of Jews from Egypt Historian Mark R. Cohen proposes a comparative approach to understanding Jewish life under Islamic rule, noting that Jews in Islamic lands often experienced less physical violence than Jews under Western Christendom. He posits that Muslims considered Jews less theologically threatening than Christians did, suggesting that the Christians wanted to establish a separate religious identity from Judaism, from which their faith split and diverged. According to him, instances of persecution were occasional, more the exception than the rule, and claims of systemic persecution at the hands of Muslim rulers are myths created to bolster political propaganda. The situation where Jews in the Muslim world both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted there at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum: > It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number > of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high > rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized > intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it > would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, > arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.G. E. Von > Grunebaum, Eastern Jewry Under Islam, 1971, p. 369. In the 7th century, the new Muslim rulers institute the kharaj land tax, which led to mass migration of Babylonian Jews from the countryside to cities like Baghdad. This in turn led to greater wealth and international influence, as well as a more cosmopolitan outlook from Jewish thinkers such as Saadiah Gaon, who now deeply engaged with Western philosophy for the first time. When the Abbasid Caliphate and the city of Baghdad declined in the 10th century, many Babylonian Jews migrated to the Mediterranean region, contributing to the spread of Babylonian Jewish customs throughout the Jewish world.Marina Rustow, Baghdad in the West: Migration and the Making of Medieval Jewish Traditions =Seljuk Empire (1077-1307) and early Ottoman rule= Jews have lived in Asia Minor for more than 2,400 years. Originally settling in Asia Minor in the Hellenistic era, they were expelled by Byzantines between the 5th and 11th centuries, resettling there only after the conquest of much of Anatolia by Muslim Seljuk forces after the Battle of Manzikert. Jewish communities grew and thrived under the Seljuks, and later also under Ottoman rule, making it a safe haven for Jews fleeing from persecution elsewhere. Early Modern Period =Ottoman Empire= Photochrom of Jews in Jerusalem, in the 1890s. The Ottoman Empire served as a refuge for Jewish refugees from Spanish empire, especially after the fall of Muslim Spain in 1492 and Edict of Expulsion. This continued through the Roman Catholic Inquisition, as secret Jews and forced converts continued to flee Spain. The Maghreb from North Africa similarly found refuge among the Ottomans, as large Arabian cities created their own restrictive Jewish quarters (Mellahs). In 1834, in Safed, Ottoman Syria, local Muslim Arabs carried out a massacre of the Jewish population known as the Safed Plunder. In 1840, the Jews of Damascus were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having used their blood to bake Passover bread.Americans React to Damascus Blood Libel A Jewish barber was tortured until he \\"confessed\\"; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the Jews of Libya were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in Marrakech and Fez in Morocco. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in Tunis, and an Arab mob on Jerba Island looted and burned Jewish homes, stores, and synagogues. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in Demnat, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in Tripolitania. Kurdistan Jews lived in Kurdistan for thousands of years, before the final and mass migration in 1951-1952 to Israel. The Jews lived under the Ottoman Empire and under the Persian Empire for many years and following World War I, they lived mainly in Iraq, Iran and Turkey, some lived in Syria. Jews lived in many Kurdish urban centers such as Aqra, Dohuk, Arbil, Zakho, Sulaimaniya, Amadia, in Southern Kurdistan, in Saqiz, Bana and Ushno, in Eastern Kurdistan, in Jezira, Nisebin, Mardin and Diyarbakƒ±r in Turkey and in Qamishle in North-Western Syria. Jews lived as well in hundreds of villages in the rural and tribal area of Kurdistan, usually one or two families in a village, where they worked as weavers of traditional Kurdish clothing or as tenants of the agha, the landlord or head of the village. =Persia= In 1656, all Jews were expelled from Isfahan and forced to convert to Islam because of a common belief that their Jewishness was impure. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice Judaism in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of jizya collected from the Jews, in 1661 they were allowed to revert to Judaism, although they were still required to wear a distinctive patch on their clothing.Littman (1979), p. 3 In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Meshed, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the Torah scrolls. The Jews themselves were violently forced to convert, narrowly avoiding complete massacre.Gilbert, Martin. Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179-182. There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.Littman (1979), p. 4.Lewis (1984), p. 168.. In 1839, the Allahdad incident, the Jews of Mashhad, Iran, now known as the Mashhadi Jews, were coerced into converting to Islam. In the middle of the 19th century, J. J. Benjamin wrote of Persian Jews: > \\"‚Ä¶they are obliged to live in a separate part of town‚Ä¶; for they are > considered as unclean creatures‚Ä¶ Under the pretext of their being unclean, > they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, > inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones > and dirt‚Ä¶ For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; > for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet > of the Mussulmans‚Ä¶ If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is > subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and > sometimes beat him‚Ä¶ unmercifully‚Ä¶ If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is > forbidden to inspect the goods‚Ä¶ Should his hand incautiously touch the > goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... > Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take > possession of whatever please them.

If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three > days of the Katel (Muharram)‚Ä¶, he is sure to be murdered.\\"Lewis (1984), pp. > 181‚Äì183 =Bukhara= A number of groups of Persian Jews have split off since ancient times, to the extent that they are now recognized as separate communities, such as the Bukharian Jews and Mountain Jews. Confined to city quarters, the Bukharan Jews were denied basic rights and many were forced to convert to Islam. They had to wear black and yellow dress to distinguish themselves from the Muslims.Bukharan Jews, Jewish Virtual Library =Zaydi Yemen= Under the Zaydi rule, discriminatory laws became more severe against the Yemenite Jews, which culminated in their eventual exile, in what later became known as the Exile of Mawza. They were considered to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.Jewish Communities in Exotic Places,\\" by Ken Blady, Jason Aronson Inc., 2000, page 10 Post-colonial era =Arab League= By the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews had left, fled or had been expelled from Arab and Muslim-majority countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States.Yehouda Shenhav The Arab Jews: A Postcolonial Reading of Nationalism, Religion, and Ethnicity The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed. In 1945, there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as Libya, which once had a Jewish population of around 3 percent, similar to that of the United States today), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain. The largest communities of Jews in Muslim countries exist in the non-Arab countries of Iran and Turkey; both, however, are much smaller than they historically have been. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in Morocco with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000. =Imperial Iran and Islamic Republic= Judaism is the second- oldest religion still existing in Iran after Zoroastrianism. By various estimates, between 8,000 and 10,000 Jews remain in Iran, mostly in Tehran and Hamedan. About one-third of the some 120,000-150,000 Iranian Jews in the mid-20th century fled the country during the 1950s, as a consequence of political instability. Most of the remaining 80,000-100,000 Jews fled during and following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Today, the largest groups of Persian Jews are found in Israel (236,000-360,000 in 2014, including second- generation Israelis) and the United States (45,000, especially in the Los Angeles area, home to a large concentration of expatriate Iranians). There are also smaller communities in Western Europe.

A catkin or ament is a slim, cylindrical flower cluster (a spike), with inconspicuous or no petals, usually wind-pollinated (anemophilous) but sometimes insect-pollinated (as in Salix). They contain many, usually unisexual flowers, arranged closely along a central stem that is often drooping. They are found in many plant families, including Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Moraceae, and Salicaceae.  Occurrence  Catkin-bearing plants include many trees or shrubs such as birch, willow, hickory, sweet chestnut, and sweetfern (Comptonia). In many of these plants, only the male flowers form catkins, and the female flowers are single (hazel, oak), a cone (alder), or other types (mulberry). In other plants (such as poplar), both male and female flowers are borne in catkins. In Britain, they can be seen in January or February, when many trees are bare for winter. They can even occur in December.  Evolution  For some time, catkins were believed to be a key synapomorphy among the proposed Hamamelididae, also known as Amentiferae (i.e., literally plants bearing aments). Based on molecular phylogeny work, it is now believed that Hamamelididae is a polyphyletic group.Savolainen, V., M. W. Chase, S. B. Hoot, C. M. Morton, D. E. Soltis, C. Bayer, M. F. Fay, A. Y. De Bruijn, S. Sullivan, and Y.-L. Qiu. 2000. Phylogenetics of flowering plants based on combined analysis of plastid atpB and rbcL gene sequences. Systematic Biology 49:306-362.Soltis, D. E. et alii. (28 authors). 2011. \\"Angiosperm phylogeny: 17 genes, 640 taxa\\". American Journal of Botany 98(4):704-730. This suggests that the catkin flower arrangement has arisen at least twice independently by convergent evolution, in Fagales and in Salicaceae.Cronk Q. C. B., Needham I., and Rudall P. J. 2015. Evolution of catkins: inflorescence morphology of selected Salicaceae in an evolutionary and developmental context. Frontiers in Plant Science. 2015; 6: 1030. Such a convergent evolution raises questions about what the ancestral inflorescence characters might be and how catkins did evolve in these two lineages.  Etymology  Etymology illustrated by pussy willow catkins from a children's book The word catkin is a loanword from the Middle Dutch katteken, meaning \\"kitten\\" (compare also German K√§tzchen). This name is due either to the resemblance of the lengthy sorts of catkins to a kitten's tail, or to the fine fur found on some catkins. Ament is from the Latin amentum, meaning \\"thong\\" or \\"strap\\".

Growing up to tall, the plant has shiny green pinnate (lobed) leaves and bears red flowers in the summer, but yields neither fruit nor seeds. King's lomatia is unusual because all of the remaining plants are genetically identical clones. Because it has three sets of chromosomes (a triploid) and is therefore sterile, reproduction occurs only vegetatively: when a branch falls, that branch grows new roots, establishing a new plant that is genetically identical to its parent. Charles Denison \\"Deny\\" King discovered the plant in 1934, though it was not described until 1967 by botanist Winifred Mary Curtis of the Tasmanian Herbarium. Only one colony of King's lomatia is known to be alive in the wild, consisting of about 600 plants over an area 1.2 km in length. Description The individual plants of L. tasmanica are straggly shrubs or small trees to high, though taller or longer trunked specimens are often bent over. The trunks of very old plants can reach diameters of . The upper branchlets are covered in fine rusty fur. The stems may grow roots from nodes on the ground. The leaves are alternately arranged and more crowded towards the ends of branches. Roughly oval in shape, they are long and pinnate, made up of 11 to 25 primary lobes that have irregularly toothed margins and are sometimes subdivided into smaller lobes. The upper surface is green and shiny, while the undersurface is partly hairy, particularly along the midrib. Flowering takes place in February. The terminal flowerheads, or inflorescences, are long. Taxonomy Charles Denison \\"Deny\\" King discovered the plant in May 1934 while mining tin in the remote southwest of Tasmania. Winifred Curtis of the Tasmanian Herbarium named the plant in King's honour in 1967, after he sent specimens he collected at Cox's bight, Port Davey to be identified in 1965. It is also sometimes called \\"King's holly\\", though it is not a holly. L. tasmanica was thought to possibly be a hybrid between L. polymorpha and another species. Genetic analysis using microsatellite markers showed that species found close together geographically are most closely related to each other; L. tasmanica is the sister of a lineage that gave rise to the other two Tasmanian Lomatia species, L. polymorpha and L. tinctoria. Subfossil remains identical to L. tasmanica were found in 43,600-year-old beds. The climate at that time was most likely as cool as or cooler than it is at Melaleuca today (an average yearly temperature of 11.5 ¬∞C, with the coldest month having an average minimum of 4.5 ¬∞C and the warmest month an average maximum of 20 ¬∞C), and possibly wetter (more than 2400 mm of precipitation annually). Distribution and habitat The entire population of Lomatia tasmanica consists of around 300 plants in an area less than 1.2 km long in southwestern Tasmania. The climate is wet, receiving an average total of 1700 mm of rain each year, and all plants grow within of a river or creek. L. tasmanica mainly grows in rainforest or mixed forest made up of trees high such as myrtle beech (Lophozonia cunninghamii), celery-top pine (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius), southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), leatherwood (Eucryphia lucida), satinwood (Nematolepis squamea), blue-green tea tree (Leptospermum glaucescens), and horizontal scrub (Anodopetalum biglandulosum), as well as understory species such as thyme archeria (Archeria serpyllifolia), native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida), sweet- scented trochocarpa (Trochocarpa gunnii), Raukaua gunnii, white waratah (Agastachys odorata), climbing heath (Prionotes cerinthoides), hard water fern (Parablechnum wattsii), and brickmaker's sedge (Gahnia grandis). Scattered Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida) tower over the canopy. Profuse moss and fern growth highlights the wetness of the habitat. L. tasmanica also extends into neighbouring dry sclerophyll forest composed of Smithton peppermint over an understory of blue-green tea tree on more elevated areas. Finally, it grows in a dense riverbank scrubland with species such as silver banksia (Banksia marginata), mƒÅnuka (Leptospermum scoparium), prickly-leaved wattle (Acacia verticillata), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), scented paperbark (M. squarrosa), horizontal scrub, and Smithton peppermint over a dense low understory of Bauera rubioides, Gahnia grandis, Epacris aff. heteronema, scrambling coral fern (Gleichenia microphylla), Calorophus erostris, lesser wire rush (Empodisma minus), and button grass (Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus). Ecology Lomatia tasmanica grows in a climate of infrequent bushfires. Fieldwork in the early 2000s established that the area had last been burnt in 1934. Most plants were around 60 years old, though some were estimated at up to 300 years old. The area in which it grows is federally protected, lying wholly within the Southwest National Park. Although all the plants are technically separate in that each has its own root system, they are collectively considered to be one of the oldest living plant clones. Each plant's lifespan is approximately 300 years, but the plant has been cloning itself for at least 43,600 years and possibly as long as 135,000 years. This estimate is based on radiocarbon dating of fossilised leaf fragments that were found away from the extant colony. The fossilised fragments are identical to the contemporary plant in cell structure and shape, which suggests that the ancestral and modern plant are also genetically identical. This further implies that the ancestral plant was also triploid and therefore also clonal, due to the extreme rarity of naturally occurring sexually reproducing triploid organisms. Conservation Lomatia tasmanica has been declared critically endangered under the Australian government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is also classified at a state level as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian government's Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The original plant group that King discovered in 1934 has disappeared (and likely died out), and the sole remaining group of approximately 500 plants covers a 1.2-kilometer-long area in the extreme southwest of Tasmania. This area is prone to fires and other natural threats to the plants, so Tasmania has begun an effort to develop other populations of L. tasmanica in controlled environments such as the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. Because of its fragility and rarity, their specimens are not on display to the public. Due to its inability to reproduce sexually, there is no possibility of increasing the plant's genetic diversity to promote disease resistance through purely natural means. However, on 19 September 2009, the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens issued a media release regarding the propagation efforts saying: \\"The Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens [RTBG] is working towards securing the future of a rare and ancient Tasmanian native plant... Lomatia tasmanica, commonly known as King's Lomatia, is critically endangered with less than 500 plants growing in the wild in a tiny pocket of Tasmania's isolated south west. The RTBG has been propagating the plant from cuttings since 1994... 'Fossil leaves of the plant found in the south west were dated at 43,600 years old and given that the species is a clone, it is possibly the oldest living plant in the world\\". Infestation with the fungal pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi has been recorded in other plant species around away from some wild L. tasmanica populations. Bushfire could also spread this pathogen and potentially facilitate its infection of the remaining wild plants. Cultivation Lomatia tasmanica strikes readily from cuttings but is difficult to keep alive in cultivation, often perishing when dried out. The cuttings are taken in January and February and take up to 12 months to form roots. Like their wild counterparts, the cultivated plants are susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi. L. tasmanica has been grafted successfully onto L. tinctoria, and the Botanic Gardens sought to trial grafting it onto L. ferruginea.

Round Lake is the smaller lake located west of Green Lake. Both lakes are meromictic, which means no seasonal mixing of surface and bottom waters occurs. Meromictic lakes are fairly rare; they have been extensively studied, in part because their sediments can preserve a historical record extending back thousands of years, and because of the euxinic (anoxic, sulfidic) conditions which can form in the deep water. Description Green Lake reaches a maximum depth of 195 feet (59 metres). Deep lakes tend to appear bluish because the wavelengths of light that can penetrate (and be dispersed at) great depths are those closer to the blue end of the spectrum. Because of its depth and the high salinity of the basin waters, the lake is meromictic and does not turn over and intermix waters like many other lakes in this region do. Green Lake's cold and dense bottom waters tend to stay separate from the shallower, warmer waters. Because of this, sediment sinks and collects in the bottom and virtually does not decay. Since the sediment is not kicked up by mixing, the lake does not take on a muddy, turbid appearance like other lakes do. Meromictic lakes also have still, mirror-like waters. Green Lake is no exception, as its tranquil, reflective water makes for great photography. The lake is glacial in origin, likely developed by glacial meltwater during the most recent North American glaciation, and its calcium and sulfate-rich waters are due to groundwater percolating through marine shale with a high gypsum content. The lake, which resembles a large river in shape, is unusually deep for its size and was regarded as being sacred by the native Onondaga tribe, which originally settled in the area. Fishing Fish species present in the lake include rainbow trout, pumpkinseed sunfish, and brook trout. There is access only by rental boats or shore fishing. History Fayetteville Green Lake (FGL) was the first lake in North America identified as meromictic,Eggleton, Frank E. (1956). \\"Limnology of a Meromictic, Interglacial, Plunge-Basin Lake,\\" Transactions of the American Microscopical Society, Vol. 75, No. 3. (Jul., 1956), pp. 334-378. and is the best-studied meromictic lake in the world, with records dating back to 1839. Green Lake was referred to as Lake Sodom by Lardner Vanuxem, who was the first to study Green Lake in 1839, and the presence of sulfide in the deeper waters of the lake was known by 1849. FGL is believed to have formed as a plunge pool during the late Wisconsin stage of glaciation at the base of a waterfall formed by the retreating glaciers, which is the reason for its extreme depth relative to a small surface area. The outflow for FGL runs underneath the Erie Canal, which is located within 300 m of the north shore of the lake. FGL is currently located in Green Lakes State Park, and since 1933, large quantities of sand have been dumped on the shore of the north end to create a swimming area. Biogeochemistry Fayetteville Green Lake is located in the Oswego River-Lake Ontario drainage system, and receives surface water from Round Lake. The water column is chemically stratified into an oxygenated upper portion (mixolimnion) and a euxinic deeper portion (monimolimnion). The stratification is maintained through the large input of ground water rich in dissolved solids to the deeper portion of the lake. The difference in the dissolved solids (Ca, Mg, SO4) between the water input to the surface and water input to the deep creates the permanent stratification observed. FGL has a sulfate concentration around 13.5 mmol/l (about half that of modern seawater) which is derived from groundwater input to the deep portion of the lake. A well-developed separation in a body of water due to differing chemistries is present between 18 and 20 m depth. The water below the chemocline is anoxic and sulfidic, and at the chemocline is a dense layer of purple sulfur bacteria which makes the water appear pink. The purple sulfur bacteria thrive in the anoxic waters and use the sulfide from the deeper water in their chemosynthesis. The color of the lake is created by the total dissolved solids (from the groundwater input) which disperse the sunlight creating a greenish color. Annual whiting events occur in FGL, due to the large Synechococcus population in the lake. Calcite precipitates in microenvironments surrounding the Synechococcus and this is believed to dominate the whiting events. Calcite precipitation is common year round at FGL, and this leads to the carbonate crust that surrounds most of the lake, and covers branches and other material that falls below the surface. Dead Man's Point is a notable example of this, and is classified as a thrombolitic bioherm. Geologic significance The meromictic character of FGL is believed to represent a possible analog to ancient ocean environments during the Precambrian and during times of environmental stress. (i.e. mass extinction events). During these times, the oceans may have become anoxic and possibly sulfidic in the deep water.Riccardi, A. L., Arthur, M. A., and Kump, L. R. (2006) \\"Sulfur isotopic evidence for chemocline upward excursions during the end-Permian mass extinction,\\" Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 70 (23 - A Special Issue Dedicated to Robert A. Berner), 5740-5752. Information about past environments can be gained through studying isotopic, chemical, and biological compositions of modern FGL.

It is one of the earliest American realist works, and is an important text for those who study labor and women's issues. It was immediately recognized as an innovative work, and introduced American readers to \\"the bleak lives of industrial workers in the mills and factories of the nation.\\" Life in the Iron Mills was initially published in The Atlantic Monthly in April 1861. After being published anonymously, both Emily Dickinson and Nathaniel Hawthorne praised the work. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward was also greatly influenced by Davis's Life in the Iron Mills and in 1868 published in The Atlantic Monthly \\"The Tenth of January\\", based on the 1860 fire at the Pemberton Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Rebecca Harding Davis was considered one of the nation's first social historians and pioneering literary artists. She wrote to find social change for blacks, women, immigrants, and the working class throughout the Civil War. Throughout her long career, Davis challenged traditional subjects and older styles of writing. During her early childhood, her family lived in Florence, Alabama, before moving in 1837 to Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), on the Ohio River. Its iron mills and immigrant populations inspired the setting of Life in the Iron Mills. Background Rebecca Harding Davis wrote Life in the Iron Mills and other short stories to represent the events going on around her during the era of the American Civil War. The short story was published by The Atlantic Monthly. Davis was paid well for her story and continued to publish short stories for The Atlantic Monthly. Life in the Iron Mills received much attention during her lifetime; she was also recognized by several literary figures including as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Amos Bronson Alcott, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Henry Ward Beecher, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne encouraged Davis to continue to write, but she was forgotten by the literary world by the time of her death. Davis attended college at the Washington Female Seminary and studied the Bible intensively. It is here Davis would encounter influential scholars and political thinkers, and explore ideas and produce thoughts of her own regarding such social and religious issues. According to some scholars, Davis' work was heavily influenced by the \\"ethical teachings of Christianity.\\" This is evident in Life in the Iron Mills, where Davis explores the greediness that derives from the Industrial Revolution. According to Gregory Hadley, Davis's writings were partly shaped by the renewed interest of Christianity called the Second Great Awakening, which emphasizes on Personal Faith that was defined on repentance, believed Christ as the Savior, and live according to the Bible and Social Action. Social reform had heavily influenced the women who were on this \\"moral crusade.\\" Protestants denominations had an remarkable growth spurt, and by the 1850s millions of Americans had converted to Christianity. Though many reviews failed to recognize Davis' Christian faith was an important factor in her writings. Davis' writings had focused on problems that Christians of her time were concerned with; slavery, work exploitation, equal education, and justice for women. The story takes place in the 1830s, a time when the Industrial Revolution was well underway. Until the 1840s well-to-do entrepreneurs established new mills and factories through their own finances because banks usually did not invest in industry or make loans to manufacturers. Industry thrived until the panic of 1837, originating in Britain, which affected investments in the United States, resulting in the bankruptcies of both British and American manufacturers and extensive unemployment. The American economy fell into a depression from which it did not emerge until 1843. By the 1850s, iron manufacturing was doing especially well, and by 1860 it was the nation's leading industry. Cotton production was another major industry. Investors profited significantly at the expense of workers. Industry depended greatly on immigrant laborers. Approximately four million Irish, German, and British immigrants moved to the United States between 1820 and 1860. Most of them were unskilled peasants, laborers, and farmers who found employment in factories, on construction sites, at warehouses and docks, and in private homes. The living conditions depicted in Life in the Iron Mills for many immigrants were poor, indeed not much better than what they had experienced in Europe. Lacking enough money to buy food, many suffered from malnutrition and from diseases like cholera, smallpox, and tuberculosis (\\"consumption\\"), with which the main character, Hugh Wolfe, is afflicted. In the era of the feminist movement, the short story resurfaced through the help of the feminist writer Tillie Olsen. As an adviser for the Feminist Press in the 1970s, she came across Life in the Iron Mills and suggested it for republication. Olsen helped the short story gain critical reception once again as Davis intended in the 19th century. Plot summary alt=An image capturing the housing conditions for iron mill workers during the industrial era. Life in the Iron Mills begins with an omniscient narrator who looks out a window and sees smog and iron workers. The gender of the narrator is never known, but it is evident that the narrator is a middle class observer. As the narrator looks out the windowpane, an old story comes to mind; a story of the house that the narrator is living in. The narrator cautions the reader to have an objective mind, and to not be quick to judge the character in the story he/she is about to tell the reader. The narrator begins to introduce Deborah, Wolfe's cousin. She is described as a meek woman who works hard, and has a hump in her back. Deborah finds out from Janey, that Hugh did not take lunch to work, and she decides to walk many miles in the rain to take a lunch for Wolfe. As she walks up to the mills, Deborah begins to describe it as if it were hell, but she keeps going for Wolfe. When she arrives Wolfe is talking among friends and he recognizes her. The narrator explains his affection for her, but also describes his affection as loveless and sympathetic. Hugh finds no time to eat his dinner and goes back to do a day of labor in the mills. Deborah, who is exhausted, stays with Hugh and rests until his shift is over. In the meantime, the narrator further explains that Wolfe does not belong in the environment of the iron mill workers. He is known as \\"Molly Wolfe\\" by other workers because of his manner and background in education. When Wolfe is working he spots men that do not look like workers. He sees Clarke, the son of Kirby, Doctor May who is a physician, and another two men that he does not recognize. These men stop by to look at the working men, and as they are talking and observing, they spot a weird object that has the shape of a human. As they get closer, they see that it is an odd shaped statue built with korl. They begin to analyze it and wonder who created such a statue, one of the workers points at Wolfe and the men go to him. They ask him why he built such a statue and what it represents. All Hugh says is that \\"She be hungry\\". The men begin to talk about the injustice of labor force, and one goes as far as to say that Hugh can get out of the meager job he is in, but that he unfortunately cannot help. The men leave, but not before Deborah steals one of their wallets, which has a check for a substantial amount inside. They go back home and Wolfe feels like he is a failure and feels anger towards his economic situation. Once home, Deborah confesses to stealing from Mitchell, and shamefully gives the money to Wolfe to do with it what he pleases. Wolfe decides to keep the money believing he is deserving of it because after all they are all deserving in God's eyes. The narrator transitions to a different scene with Dr. May reading the newspaper and seeing that Wolfe was put in jail for stealing from Mitchell. The story goes back to Hugh and he is in prison with Deborah. The narrator explains how terrible their situation is, and goes on to give detail of Wolfe's mental disintegration. Hugh ends up losing his mind and killing himself in prison. The story ends with a Quaker woman who comes to bless and help with the body of Hugh. She talks to Deborah and promises her that she will give Hugh a proper burial, and come back for her when she is released from jail. Characters *Hugh Wolfe is a Welsh puddler, who was born into poverty, is a laborer who turns pig iron into wrought iron by puddling. Despite the demanding hours at the mill, Hugh has a special talent; artistic talent to sculpt out of korl, \\"a light, porous substance, of a delicate, waxen, flesh- colored tinge\\", a leftover refuse from the smelting process. Many of the workers make fun of Hugh for his interest in sculpting and his relationship with Deborah. Hugh yearns for beauty and purity. He has a good heart and cares for Deborah, even though she influences him into taking the stolen money. *Deborah Wolfe, is Hugh's cousin, a hunch back who loves Hugh, and often takes dinner to Hugh, even if it means her missing dinner. She works at the spools and inadvertently plays a key role in Hugh's downward spiral in the narrative. *Janey, is a child who sleeps over at Hugh and Deb's occasionally when her father is drunk. She is clearly beautiful, which makes Deb jealous. *Mr. Clarke, an overseer at the iron mill where Hugh works. *Young Kirby, son of the mill's co-owner. He feels no obligation toward the workers except \\"a narrow limit,--the pay-hour on Saturday night.\\" *Doctor May. He is one of the town's physicians. He feels compassion toward the workers, but the overwhelming task of improving the thousands of workers (1200 at this mill alone) prevents him from helping Hugh, even when Hugh asks for it explicitly. Instead, he gives Hugh some empty words of encouragement. *Mitchell. Kirby's brother-in-law (and son-in-law of the mill owner), a man broadly educated in the classical sense who was \\"spending a couple of months in the boarders of a Slave State, to study the institutions of the South\\" (Davis, 17). *A reporter (who accompanies Clarke, Young Kirby, Doctor May and Mitchell on a tour of the mill). *A Quaker woman. She aids Deborah during and after prison, and provides a grave for Hugh. She provides the only sincere assistance to the poor in the story. *The narrator who recounts the story is an unknown person of some higher class. \\"Many scholars assume the narrative voice is female.\\"LIFE IN THE IRON MILLS  Novelguide She or he possesses the korl woman statue as the only remaining evidence of Hugh's existence. *The Korl Woman. A sculpture that was created by Hugh, which showcases Hugh's artistic talent. She is made out of korl. The Korl woman represents industrialism's effect on the working class. Style Life in the Iron Mills must be considered a central text in the origins of American realism, American proletarian literature, and American feminism, according to Jean Pfaelzer. The story was revolutionary in its compelling portrait of the working class's powerlessness to break the oppressive chains of industrial capitalism. Author of The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896 (1984) and many articles on Davis, Pfaelzer edits the volume's literary selections and supplies the substantial critical introduction, which maintains that Davis inherited the sentimental literary tradition but nonetheless wrote \\"common stories\\" that \\"exposed the tension between sentimentalism, a genre predicated on the repression of the self, and realism, a genre predicated on the search for individual identity.\\" Davis's realistic depiction of the gritty, hellish mills and the impoverished workers' lives is far removed from the material advantages of the upper classes often portrayed in domestic fiction. She also uses the vernacular and dialect skillfully to depict realistically her uneducated immigrant characters and to emphasize their lower-class status. Davis counteracts positive images of healthy, wholesome mill girls and mills as ideal places of work. Life in the Iron Mills challenges the optimism of transcendentalism by showing how industrialism fueled by greedy capitalists destroys the natural environment and the human spirit. Literary analysis and main themes =Feminism= Life in the Iron Mills is one of the earliest American Realist stories published. It was Rebecca Harding Davis's first published work, first appearing anonymously in the April 1861 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. After its publication, it caused a literary sensation with its powerful naturalism that anticipated the work of √âmile Zola, Theodore Dreiser and Frank Norris. It was reprinted in the early 1970s by the Feminist Press with a well-known introduction by Tillie Olsen and has continued to be an important text for those who study labor and women‚Äôs issues.Olsen, Tillie ‚ÄúA Biographical Interpretation.‚Äù In Rebecca Harding Davis, Life in the Iron Mills. New York: The Feminist Press, 1972.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English: Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present, Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements, Isobel Grundy, editors. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1990. Anticipating post-Darwinian naturalism, Davis's most famous depiction of the redundant, dehumanizing servitude of American labor in Life in the Iron- Mills (initially an anonymous publication) may be American literature's first industrial muckraker. Its graphic probe into ethnicity, vocation, and class also encompasses, according to Pfaelzer, what became Davis's most characteristic subject and theme: strong women and powerlessness. \\"Life in the Iron Mills\\" reworks Davis's struggles with the problems of thwarted vocation, feminine longing and the alienation of an immigrant (and in an allusion to a textile mill, an interracial) industrial proletariat. Davis's is not only a dual projection of resentments at her own domestic and artistic oppression, but also an ambitious bi-gender proletarian narrative. Nevertheless, the authorial decision to use dual protagonists highlights even more greatly the sexual division of labor, the social relations between working men and workingwomen that is produced, and the very nature of the female work character. Davis takes pains to initiate her readers into the knowledge of hitherto little acknowledged social realities; she seems a pioneer exploring a territory which, by the end of the nineteenth century, would be recognized as the new American wilderness. Davis's story comes to life not as a work which is admirable because it is almost realistic, but as a work which astonishes and informs its past and present readers because it shares in and extends the accomplishments of the romance. =Immigration and industrialization= The story also \\"launched a pathbreaking expos√© of the effects of capitalism and industrialization, including the physical, spiritual, and intellectual starvation of immigrant wage earners. In fact, the novel is recognized as being the first literary work in America to focus on the relationships among industrial work, poverty, and the exploitation of immigrants within a capitalistic economy\\". Life in the Iron Mills is an explosive study of the working poor, prophetic of the class struggle that would fill the main chapters of nineteenth century labor history. Davis's story is remarkable for its solidarity with the cause of the workers. Writers who took up the subject of the labor wars more typically enlisted on the side of corporate authority. As Davis shows, the Industrial Revolution also brought with it class distinctions clearly exhibited by the material wealth of capitalists and industrialists who possessed the means to build lavish homes with elaborate architecture. In contrast, factory workers and other unskilled laborers often lived in crowded boardinghouses and small apartments. Because they lived in such deplorable and disorderly conditions, held such lower-class status, and faced the stress and uncertainty of work, many wage earners indulged in alcohol consumption. Davis effectively captures these conflicts in Life in the Iron Mills., 2011, eNotes.com, Inc. As far as the country was concerned, immigrants saw America as a place with many job opportunities due to industrialization and urbanization. In the 1840s the nation received 1.7 million immigrants, and then 2.6 million in the 1850s. Many owners of industrial plants and mills became rich by exploiting the immigrant workers in order to provide cheap goods. Davis was said to have, \\"sought to make her readers aware that their material comfort was enabled neither by palliative classical gods nor by cheap coal and river barges but by real human beings, who ate, slept, and toiled in unspeakable conditions\\" (4). Reception In the late 1800s Life in the Iron Mills received national criticism when published in The Atlantic Monthly. Many readers of the Monthly believed that the author of the story was a man because of Davis's strong language and use of realism. Davis also published her early works anonymously, but as she gained fame from The Atlantic Monthly she began to sign her name to her work.The New York Times. \\"Rebecca H. Davis, Novelist, is Dead : Electronic Edition\\". Retrieved on October 26, 2011. Life in the Iron Mills took readers away from abolitionist and Civil War conflicts, and reminded them of the community of iron workers going through injustice as well. Davis also had strong literary supporters such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and many others.Harris, Sharon. Rebecca Harding Davis and American Realism: Electronic Edition Retrieved on October 27, 2011. Rebecca Harding Davis disappeared from the literary world after ending her publications in The Atlantic Monthly. Life in the Iron Mills regained critical reception with the help of Tillie Olsen. In the 1970s many feminist supporters wrote about the power of Rebecca Harding Davis's short story. Norma Rosen, the author of \\"Joy to Revine\\" explains her first experience when reading Life in the Iron Mills: \\"With this book, Life in the Iron Mills in my hand, I feel I am standing in corridor of echoes\\".Rosen, Norma. The Ordeal of Rebecca Harding: Electronic Edition Retrieved on October 26, 2011. Another critic, Federick Whittacker, describes Rebecca Harding Davis as a writer who takes part in the concept \\"Knight of labor\\", which too Whittacker represents writers who create literary fiction concerning the iron mill labor force in the 1800s. Life in the Iron Mills, was considered by most critics during the 1970s and 1980s, as one of the first works representing the iron mill labor force through realism. Life in the Iron mills still inspires literary criticism. Davis's short story has its own Bedford Cultural Edition, which introduces Life in the Iron Mills literary importance during the 19th century. The Bedford edition also explores the relation of Davis to the short story, and how her background influences the narrative.Tichi, Cecelia. A Bedford Cultural Edition: Life in the Iron Mills, 1998. Many critics explore the different themes that can be interpreted in the short story and its relation to the authors environment and historical context. Sheila Hassle Hughes exemplifies the conflicts that arise among critics about the themes Life in the Iron Mills represents:Hughes, Shelia. American Quarterly: A Liberationist Reading of Class and Gender in Life in the Iron Mills, 1997. Legacy Rebecca Harding Davis's Life in the Iron Mills, was recognized as a significant short story by writers such as Emily Dickinson, Louisa May Alcott, and Nathaniel Hawthorne among many others. The short story also influenced a lot of women writers after the republication of the story by Tillie Olsen. For example, Life in the Iron Mills inspired Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward to write the short story \\"The Tenth of January\\" in 1868, which dealt with a mill that collapsed in Lawrence, Massachusetts. (This information is incorrect. Tillie Olsen's piece was first published in 1972 and could not have possibly influenced Ward, as the sentence seems to imply.)The short story is recognized as the starting point for the use of realism in literature representing the labor force.

The school was referred to as Strathcona Composite High School up until 2014. A $6.1 million modernization project was completed in 2015 and the school now enrolls approximately 1500 students.  Overview  The original Strathcona High School opened in 1908, in the city of Strathcona, Alberta. The school, like the city, were named after Lord Strathcona, a pioneering Scottish businessman and Canadian Parliamentarian, who was very influential in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The city amalgamated with Edmonton in 1912, with the school joining the Edmonton Public Schools system. The population of Edmonton grew quickly, and Strathcona Composite High School outgrew its 1908 building. In 1955, the school transferred 20 blocks south to a newly built structure (the current building), on a large block of parkland. (The original 1908 building went through various uses before becoming Old Scona Academic High School in 1976.) Strathcona Composite is located on Edmonton's south side, just south of the Old Strathcona historic district. The school houses about 60 classrooms, several computer labs, two gymnasiums, a library media centre with networked CDs, a cafeteria, a fitness centre and a community pool operated by River City Recreation, a private contractor. Outside the school, the track team uses Rollie Miles Athletic Field. This field was also used as a training facility for the 1978 Commonwealth Games, the 2001 IAAF World Championships in Athletics, the 2005 World Masters Games and hosted olympic trials for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Other facilities nearby the school include South Side Sports Arena, which Phys Ed classes use for the skating unit. Strathcona High School teams use the team name \\"Strathcona (or Scona) Lords\\", referring to their school mascot. At the main entrance of the school, known as the Michener Entrance, an old lamp from the original Old Scona building is on during school hours and hangs above the Strathcona crest which, out of respect, students and staff will not walk across.  Global Initiatives  Since 2008, Strathcona High School has united annually to turn the motto ‚Äúas one who serves‚Äù into reality. As of 2019, students have raised over $3 million. By engaging in multiple local service projects and massive global initiatives, Strathcona students have had a chance to learn about servant leadership, entrepreneurship, global citizenship, and social affairs. Students in the Leadership Program work behind the scenes to plan and organize each initiative, but it is the mass participation of all departments, clubs, teams and community allies that has made past campaigns successful. Below is a brief overview of previous campaigns: =Take a Spin For Chelsea (2008)= * Was a fundraiser and spirit raiser for Chelsea, a student who suffered a horrific car accident that caused her to lose function in her legs, and become a paraplegic. The school raised $27,000 to help with wheelchair accessibility at home and at school. =Spread the Word (2009)= * $30,000 helped give the gift of literacy to children by building a school at an HIV orphanage in Bumala, Kenya. =Play it Forward (2010)= * $54,500 helped support programs that use play as a tool to promote education and health in developing countries through a partnership with Right to Play. =Not For Sale (2011)= * Shone light on the dark issue of human trafficking by raising awareness and lobbying the Canadian government to create tougher anti-human trafficking laws, and raised $36,000 towards this cause. =Live Love Lend (2012)= * $56,000 was raised for Kiva, a microfinancing website that empowers entrepreneurs in developing nations. This money was re-loaned multiple times to generate a total of $248,550 as of November 2014. =H2All (2013)= * Working with WaterCan, the Canadian Development Agency turned the initial amount of $50,000 into $125,000 to build four wells and sanitation projects in four Ethiopian communities. =Chain Reaction (2014)= * $180,000 was raised in partnership with World Bicycle Relief to buy bicycles for people in Africa and Asia. The bicycles allowed for increased access to education, medical care and entrepreneurial opportunities. =Treehouse Project (2015)= * In 2015, Strathcona High School started the Treehouse Project. The project aimed to end youth homelessness in the City of Edmonton and to build an ecolodge in Ecuador run by locals as a means of economic support. *The School decided to do a 24-hour \\"Bikeathon\\", and set a goal of $200,000. The school exceeded its goal by raising over $352,000 with 1,100 students participating. Subsequently, the event made history as Canada's largest school charity project. =Bike2Box (2016)= * Shelter Box Canada was chosen as the charity to be supported in a school-wide vote of student and staff. Similar to 2015, a Bikeathon was the means of raising money. The 2016 fundraising goal of $200,000 was far surpassed as students raised just over $449,000. Approximately 1200 students participated. As a result, Bike2Box broke the record for the largest student- led fundraiser in Canada, while also maintaining their lead as Canada's largest school charity project.http://www.shelterboxcanada.org/news.php?id=1764 =Hope in Motion (2017)= * The Jack Davis Hope Foundation was selected as the charity to be supported in a school-wide vote of student and staff. The event was held from March 10, 2017 through to March 11, 2017. * The school set a fundraising goal of $300,000 due to the success of the previous two events. The school ultimately raised just over $460,000. This brought the grand total raised by Strathcona's initiatives since 2008 to more than $1,934,000. =Break the Cycle (2018)= * Earth Group, in partnership with the World Food Programme, was selected as the charity to be supported in a school-wide vote of student and staff. The 2018 Bikeathon event was held on March 16, 2018 and followed through to the morning of March 17, 2018. * With the Break the Cycle campaign, Strathcona reached another milestone in its Global Initiatives, surpassing half-a-million dollars fundraised in a single initiative. The school raised $518,000 to feed over 1.6 million children in need across the world, including 100,000 meals for the Edmonton Food Bank. This pushed the total money fundraised by each campaign since 2008 well over the $2 million mark and totalling some $2,452,000.00. =Beyond Borders (2019)= *Doctors Without Borders, or M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF), was selected as the charity to be supported in the 2019 Bikeathon through a school-wide vote of students and staff. The 2019 Bikeathon event was held from March 15, 2019 through to March 16, 2019. In recognition of the fundraiser, the Mayor of Edmonton, Don Iveson, proclaimed March 15, ‚ÄúBeyond Borders Day‚Äù in the City of Edmonton. *The school set a fundraising goal of $350,000 due in part to the success of the previous events. The school far surpassed their goal, raising a total of $560,830. This pushed the total amount raised by each campaign since 2008 past the $3 Million mark, totalling $3,012,830.00. =One! Step Forward (2020)= * One! International Poverty Relief was chosen to be the 2020 Bikeathon supported charity through a school-wide student vote. Students and their teams raised $497,797.35 with the help of 3474 donors. *The 2020 Bikeathon was cancelled on March 11, two days before the original Bikeathon opening ceremonies, citing concern over Coronavirus disease 2019 and its upgraded status as a pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization.  Theatre productions  Strathcona High School has a well established theatre program. In addition to the major productions listed below, the students at the school, with direction from the staff, participate in and create various other theatre projects including: OneAct Festival (plays directed by Grade 12 Students using student cast and crew), smaller scale productions by the various Drama classes, pep rallies, and in conjunction with Students Union and other student bodies, a Talent show and an Awards night.

Included in this number is the first female Rhodes scholar from Alberta. Scona also has an Advanced Placement (AP) program, which is one of the largest in Canada. By completing internationally recognized exams, administered by the College Board, many Strathcona students earn credit that can be applied to first year University courses. Currently, the school offers AP courses in Studio Art, Biology, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Chemistry, Physics 2, Capstone Research, Statistics, Computer Science, English Language, English Literature, Spanish Language, European History, French Language, French Literature, and German Language. For the 2014‚Äì2015 school year and registered enrolment for the 2015‚Äì2016 school year, Strathcona High School has the largest AP (Advanced Placement) program in Canada. AP grade averages ranked the highest in Canada, and second in North America. In 2012, Strathcona High School was one of 10 schools worldwide to participate in the pilot program of the AP Capstone program.Edmonton School Board press release The program became fully operational for the 2014‚Äì15 school year, with 100 of the more than 20,000 AP schools participating. Strathcona was the only school in Alberta, and one of only 15 in Canada, to participate in the program in its first years. As of the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, there are 27 Canadian schools participating in the Capstone program. Strathcona, W.P. Wagner High School, and Queen Elizabeth High School, all in Edmonton, were the only Alberta schools participating.  Notable alumni  Two of the educators who served as principal of Strahcona High School were influential community leaders in Edmonton. Principal Ross Sheppard would later serve as Superintendent of the Edmonton Public School Board.

The river forms in Scarsdale at Brookline Road and flows 10 miles (16 km) south until it empties into Eastchester Bay in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The river provides the basis for the jagged city line at the north-west of New Rochelle's, where it abuts Scarsdale and then Eastchester; further dowstream and south, it plays a similar role between Mount Vernon and Pelham. The river is named for Anne Hutchinson, who came from Rhode Island in 1642 and settled on Pelham Neck to the east of the river, across from where Co-op City is now. She is described as murdered, by a group of Native Americans, the following year. Navigation The Hutchinson river is navigable for its final . Tugs and barges and the occasional small tanker still make their way to the terminals that are still operating. The northernmost active terminal, Sprague Energy located at 100 Canal St. in Mount Vernon, still accepts barges of heating oil, ULSD, and biodiesel blends daily. The other two active docks are PASCAP, which exports scrap metal, and the former Colonial Sand and Gravel dock, which accepts scows full of aggregate to make cement and asphalt. The river is suffering from neglect, and although it was dredged in 2010, the northernmost section was not and is filling in with silt. Only shallow draft barges can reach Sprague terminal and only at high water; at lower tides squat can cause barges to beach. The northernmost dock in the dredged project, Imperia Brothers Inc., has not been able to accept a scow of aggregates since 2007 due to the silt build-up. Crossings The Hutchinson River Bridge carries Amtrak's Northeast Corridor Looking southeast from Eastchester Bridge Looking northwest from Eastchester Bridge. Main channel of the river is to the right. Six bridges span the river's navigable section, carrying rail and automobile traffic. They are, from downstream heading upstream: Pelham Bridge (movable), Amtrak's Pelham Bay Bridge (movable), Hutchinson River Parkway (movable), New England Thruway (fixed), and Eastchester Bridge (Boston Post Road) (fixed), in The Bronx; and Fulton Ave Bridge in Pelham Manor (movable). The movable bridges still employ tenders and open daily for maritime traffic. Reservoirs The New Rochelle Water Company dammed the Hutchinson River at three places between 1886 and 1907, creating three reservoirs at the northern end of the community. The Westchester County Park Commission purchased the reservoirs and the surrounding water shed property in 1927, for parkland and parkway purposes. A part of the land was used for the Hutchinson River Parkway, which follows the river for most of its distance. The three reservoirs are numbered in the order they were built. Reservoir No. 1, which is now known as Lake Innisfree, is furthest upstream, and was constructed in 1886. Lake Innisfree is the largest of the reservoirs. It is mostly surrounded by private land, but its dam and part of its eastern shore can be accessed on foot by the Leatherstocking Trail. The Hutchinson River runs about .75 miles from Lake Innisfree to the northern reaches of Reservoir 3, constructed in 1907. Immediately after exiting Reservoir 3 the river flows under the Hutchinson River Parkway and then only about .1 mile to Reservoir 2, which was constructed in 1892 and is the smallest of the three. Reservoir 3 and Reservoir 2 are both contained within Twin Lakes County Park and are accessible by the Leatherstocking Trail and other trails. All three reservoirs are no longer for water supply.

Gerber currently serves as Editor & Publisher, personally handling all aspects of the venture. This auteurist method is somewhat unique in publishing; Gerber refined and perfected it with Barry Trotter and his other large-scale parodies of the 90's and 00's. In addition to providing an old-style closeness between editor and audience (as with Hugh Hefner and Stan Lee), its efficiency allows Bystander to pay its contributors. A March 2019 column in The New York Times by Jennifer Finney Boylan lauded Gerber's \\"hard work and genius\\" as it detailed Bystander's long, strange path to publication. In early 1982, a full pilot issue was prepared by then-Editor Brian McConnachie and Managing Editor Boylan, but funding fell through before it could be distributed; Gerber referred to this test-run as he prepared the 2015 edition, blending it with contemporary trends in comedy and design.

As a result, he is frequently contacted by student editors from all around the world, and has most recently worked with students at DePaul University, Ohio State University, Cambridge University, and UCLA. His humor novels have sold 1.2 million copies in 25 languages worldwide. Before turning to comedy, Gerber considered a career as an historian specializing in the 1960s and 70s. In 2008 he, along with novelist/editor Ed Park and author Devin McKinney, launched the popular Beatles fan site Hey Dullblog.

It is directly connected to the Downtown Brampton Terminal which serves GO Transit and Brampton Transit buses. History Brampton station circa 1910 Brampton station opened in 1856 as a part of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) line between Toronto and London. The current station building was built in 1907. The GTR was acquired by the Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1923, then in 1977 CN's passenger rail division was transferred to Via Rail. GO Transit began serving the station in 1974 with the creation of the Georgetown line (now Kitchener Line). A new second platform on the south side of the tracks was built 2009-2011 featuring a covered section, improved lighting and security systems as well as an automatic snow melting system. Previously only the north track had been accessible to passenger trains with a tunnel underneath the track for passengers entering from Station Street/George Street North. In July 2014 Metrolinx (GO Transit) purchased the station from CN for $2.5 Million. Overview The station is wheelchair accessible and the building houses a waiting room and ticket sales. The train station is connected by a passenger tunnel to the Downtown Brampton Bus Terminal on the south side. With growing commuter ridership, the station's parking lot is operating over its designed capacity, and cannot be extended because of its downtown location. Mount Pleasant GO Station opened in early 2005 to take some of the pressure off this station. The trackage between Bramalea and Georgetown is still owned by Canadian National and it is part of the railway's primary freight line across Ontario. This limits the number of passenger trains that can operate through Brampton. Services The GO Transit Kitchener line trains operate between Toronto Union Station and Kitchener, with many trips terminating in Mount Pleasant or Georgetown. As of 2019, train service operates on weekdays only with up to 3 trains per hour in the peak direction, and one train per hour at other times. On weekends, GO bus service operates to Toronto from the adjacent Brampton Bus Terminal. Via Rail Corridor intercity trains operate west to Stratford, London, and Sarnia, and east to Toronto Union Station. Between 1982 and 2004, Brampton was an intermediate stop on the International Limited, a joint Via Rail and Amtrak service between Chicago and Toronto. The Downtown Brampton Terminal serves GO buses to Yorkdale, York Mills and Union stations in Toronto, Orangeville and Guelph, as well as Brampton Transit local buses.

According to the church, chastity means that \\"sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\\"\\"Same-Sex Marriage\\", churchofjesuschrist.org, accessed June 17, 2016. Therefore, abstinence from sexual relations before marriage, and complete fidelity to one's spouse during marriage, are required. As part of the law of chastity, the church teaches its members to abstain from adultery and fornication. General standards Within the LDS Church, chastity means more than abstinence from sex. It means to be morally clean in \\"thoughts, words, and actions.\\" It also means sexual relations are only permitted between a husband and wife. The church teaches its members that \\"no one, male or female, is to have sexual relations before marriage. After marriage, sexual relations are permitted only with our spouse.\\" Members of the LDS Church believe that sexuality between man and woman lawfully married is divinely appointed and has two purposes: to \\"multiply, and replenish the Earth\\" () as commanded by God to Adam and Eve, and to strengthen the bond between man and woman that they might \\"become one flesh\\" (). A church handbook states that \\"[p]hysical intimacy between husband and wife is intended to be beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. Tenderness and respect‚Äînot selfishness‚Äîshould guide their intimate relationship.\\"\\"Husband and Wife\\", General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ¬ß 2.1.2. The church has made its views clear in many publications and in recent news releases that \\"marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God\\".. See also: The Family: A Proclamation to the World While opposing homosexual behavior, the church advises its leaders and members to reach out with understanding and respect to individuals who are attracted to those of the same gender.\\"Same-Sex Attraction and Same- Sex Behavior\\", General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ¬ß 38.6.12. Sexual relations are deemed proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife. Any other sexual relations, including those between persons of the same gender, are considered sinful and undermining of the divinely created institution of the family. The church accordingly affirms defining marriage as the legal and lawful union between a man and a woman.\\"Same-Sex Marriage\\", General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ¬ß 38.6.13. Youth teaching An LDS Church publication published particularly for young men and women states: \\"Before marriage, do not participate in passionate kissing, lie on top of another person, or touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body, with or without clothing. Do not do anything else that arouses sexual feelings. Do not arouse those emotions in your own body.‚Äù Youth are taught in church classes that sexual relations are sacred, and they should avoid \\"fondling of bodies, one's own or that of others\\". Masturbation is \\"not condoned but is not considered homosexual\\". Importance The LDS Church places great emphasis on the law of chastity. Commitment to live the law of chastity is required for baptism,\\"Chapter 12: How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation?\\", Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2004) pp. 203‚Äì12. and adherence is required to receive a temple recommend.. The Book of Mormon teaches that sexual sins are \\"most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost\\" (). Church leaders have similarly emphasized its importance. Ezra Taft Benson, one of the church's presidents, wrote: Violation of the law of chastity may result in a church membership council, including formal membership restrictions or withdrawal of membership. In endowment ceremony The law of chastity is one of the covenants members of the LDS Church promise by oath to keep during the endowment ceremony of the temple. Includes broader transgressions Activities considered a violation of the law of chastity include both adultery and fornication as well as broader behavior. While serving as church president, Kimball taught that the law of chastity encompasses \\"all sexual relations outside marriage‚Äîpetting, sex perversion, masturbation, and preoccupation with sex in one's thoughts and talking. Included are every hidden and secret sin and all unholy and impure thoughts and practices.\\" Victims of rape, incest, or sexual abuse are not guilty of sin and are not considered to have broken the law of chastity. However, they often feel that they have lost their virtue, which intensifies the feelings of shame and guilt experienced by many victims of rape. In the Book of Mormon, it states, \\"For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and [they] depriv[ed] them of that which was most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue\\". In a general conference address, Richard G. Scott explained, \\"The victim must do all in his or her power to stop the abuse. Most often, the victim is innocent because of being disabled by fear or the power or authority of the offender. At some point in time, however, the Lord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree of responsibility for abuse. Your priesthood leader will help assess your responsibility so that, if needed, it can be addressed.\\" In addition, members are taught to dress modestly, to control their thoughts, and to avoid pornography. Dressing immodestly is not a violation of the law of chastity, but \\"modesty promotes chastity\\". Members who are married are instructed to \\"be faithful to your spouse in thought, word, and action. Stay away from situations where temptation may develop.\\" According to the church, even though the violation of the law of chastity is considered a serious sin, one who has violated the law of chastity can repent and receive forgiveness from God. Homosexuality The LDS Church allows members to identify as gay and participate in temple ordinances, but bans any same-sex sexual activity. The LDS Church teaches that same-sex sexual and romantic feelings are not a choice or sin and that members should be supported in identifying with terms like gay, lesbian, or bisexual. \\"If you experience same-sex attraction, you may choose to use a sexual orientation label to describe yourself. ... If you decide to ... openly identify as gay, you should be supported.\\" Members whose sexual orientation is not strictly heterosexual can participate in temple ordinances and remain in good standing, although, for this they are not allowed to express their sexuality through dating people of the same sex. These teachings leave strictly-homosexually-oriented members with the option of entering a mixed-orientation opposite-sex marriage, or living a celibate lifestyle without any sexual expression (including masturbation). Masturbation On many occasions church leaders have taught that members should not masturbate as part of obedience to the law of chastity.. Reprint without permission at qrd.org Salient examples of this include a church guide to stop masturbating produced in the 1970s. Another is the 1990 edition of the church's youth guidelines pamphlet which stated that the \\"Lord specifically forbids ... masturbation\\" with the next two editions (including the most current one) alluding to it with statements forbidding anything that \\"arouses\\" any sexual feelings or emotions in one's \\"own body\\". Apostle Spencer W. Kimball, who later served as church president, warned of the \\"possible damages\\" and \\"dangers\\" of this \\"common indescretion\\".Transcript reprint with permission at mentalhealthlibrary.info on various occasions calling it a \\"reprehensible sin\\" that grows \\"with every exercise\\". The apostle Boyd K. Packer gave a 1976 general conference address \\"To Young Men Only\\" warning young men not to tamper with their little factory (a euphemism for their reproductive system) lest it speed up and become a guilt-and depression- inducing habit that is not easy to resist. He gave vigorous exercise as a method to help control thoughts and break the habit of masturbation since it is a \\"transgression\\" that is \\"not pleasing to the Lord\\".Samantha Allen, \\"Tim Ferriss Is Bro Culture's Anti-Masturbation Crusader\\" , The Daily Beast, August 1, 2014. The talk was printed as a pamphlet and widely distributed by the church from 1980 to 2016.Peggy Fletcher Stack, \\"LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet\\" , The Salt Lake Tribune, November 14, 2016. Since 1985 the church has provided a manual for parents to use in discussing sexuality with their children. The manual includes statements that \\"prophets have condemned [masturbation] as a sin\\" and \\"perversion of the body's passions\\" that causes one to \\"become carnal\\". The most recent explicit mention of masturbation by top leaders in public discourse was by Tad R. Callister who stated in a 2013 speech at BYU-Idaho that God \\"condemns self- abuse\\" (a euphemism for masturbation). Pornography As part of teaching the law of chastity, LDS Church leaders have repeatedly condemned the use of sexually arousing literature and visual material for decades.

The Economist described Scoble‚Äôs influence in its February 15, 2005 edition: An article that describes Scoble‚Äôs role at Microsoft On June 10, 2006, Scoble announced Robert posting about why he left Microsoft he was leaving Microsoft to join Podtech.net as vice president of media development with a higher salary accompanied by \\"a quite aggressive stock option\\" offer that would have made him wealthy if his new company had succeeded. According to Alexa Internet that day had the biggest traffic to his blog and PodTech over their lifetime. June 28, 2006 was his last day at Microsoft. =Fast Company= On December 11, 2007, while taking part in a panel discussion at the LeWeb3 Conference, Scoble inadvertently leaked news (by loading up a post on TechCrunch) that he would be leaving PodTech on January 14, 2008, and was likely to join Fast Company. He acknowledged the news on his blog on December 12 but stated that he had not yet signed on with Fast Company. He did a video interview about his plans. and leased studio space from Revision3. On March 3, 2008, Scoble launched FastCompany.tv with two shows: FastCompany Live and ScobleizerTV. He characterizes the first as \\"a show done totally on cell phones.\\" The second is similar to his previous show on PodTech, only with better equipment and a camera operator.

In 2012, Building 43 was re-branded as Small Teams, Big Impact. Scoble's mission remains to find and report bleeding edge technology.. Scoble left Rackspace to join UploadVR in 2016 as an entrepreneur in residence. Allegations of sexual harassment and assault On October 20, 2017, the news outlet BuzzFeed published a story that alleges that in 2010, Scoble sexually harassed Michelle Greer, his Rackspace coworker, and Quinn Norton, a technology journalist, whose account was corroborated by multiple witnesses. Scoble apologized after the BuzzFeed article was published, saying that he has been working towards making amends ever since becoming sober two years ago. However, several women countered this claim, reporting that he made inappropriate advances during the time period he claimed to be sober. Days later, he deleted his apology, and proclaimed his innocence in a blog post that also announced his new company, LightPitch. One immediate reaction was by the VR/AR Association (VRARA), stating: \\"In light of recent news and allegations of sexual harassment by Robert Scoble, the VR/AR Association has formally removed Robert from our Board of Advisors.

Many countries have built railway guns, but the best-known are the large Krupp-built pieces used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Smaller guns were often part of an armoured train. Only able to be moved where there were good tracks, which could be destroyed by artillery bombardment or airstrike, railway guns were phased out after World War II.  Design considerations  The design of a railway gun has three firing issues over and above those of an ordinary artillery piece to consider. Namely how the gun is going to be traversed ‚Äì i.e. moved from side to side to aim; how the horizontal component of the recoil force will be absorbed by the gun's carriage and how the vertical recoil force will be absorbed by the ground. = Methods of traverse = Non-traversing (top); car traversing mount (middle); top carriage traversing mount (bottom) 12-inch howitzers on top-carriage traversing mounts, traversed 90¬∞, Catterick, December 1940 The first method of traverse is to rely entirely on movement along a curved section of track or on a turntable with no provision to traverse the gun on its mount. The second is to traverse the rail car body on its trucks, known as a car-traversing mount. Generally this is limited to a few degrees of traverse to either side unless an elaborate foundation is built with a centre pivot and traversing rollers. The design of the foundation is the only limit to the amount of traverse allowed in this latter case. The third choice is to allow the separate gun mount to rotate with respect to the rail car body, known as a top-carriage traversing mount. This usually requires the gun to be mounted on a central pivot which, in turn, is mounted on the car body. With few exceptions these types of mounts require some number of outriggers, stabilisers, or earth anchors to keep them in place against the recoil forces and are generally more suitable for smaller guns. The American post‚ÄìWorld War I assessment of railway artillery considered that the utility of even a small amount of traverse for fine adjustments was high enough that either of the two latter traversing methods is preferable to a fixed mount.Miller vol. I, p. 39 = Recoil systems = Cradle recoil (top); top carriage recoil (second); sliding recoil (third); rolling recoil (bottom) There are four primary methods to absorb the recoil force for railway guns: cradle recoil, top-carriage recoil, sliding recoil and rolling recoil. Cradle recoil means that the gun recoils backward in its cradle, retarded and stopped by hydraulic buffers. It is returned to battery, or the firing position, by either helical springs or by air in a pneumatic recuperator cylinder that is compressed by the force of recoil. This is the most common method used for lighter railroad guns and for virtually all field artillery designed after the French introduced their Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897. Top-carriage recoil is the situation in which the gun is mounted in an upper carriage that moves on wheels on fixed rails mounted on the lower. The gun and upper carriage recoil together, restrained by the usual hydraulic buffers. Return to battery is effected either by gravity, through the use of inclined rails, which the gun and carriage have run up, by springs, or even by rubber bands, on some improvised mounts.Miller vol. I, p. 52 It is not well-suited to firing at high elevations because it cannot absorb much of the vertical component of the recoil force.Miller vol. I, p. 65 This French 320 mm railway gun uses sliding recoil. The jacked-down sleepers are visible at full-size. Sliding recoil has the car body sitting on a set of wooden crossbeams or \\"sleepers\\" placed underneath it which have been jacked down on to a special set of girders incorporated into the track so that about half the weight of the mount has been transferred to them from the trucks. The gun, car body and trucks all recoil together with the friction generated by the crossbeams sliding on the girders absorbing the recoil force after moving only about to the rear. The sleepers must be jacked up again to allow the gun to roll forward to its firing position. This was often done by handwheels driving gear trains attached to the wheels, or even by electric motors on more modern mounts. Almost all of these type of mounts were of the non-traversing type and had to be fired from a curved section of track or turntable. The American post‚ÄìWorld War I assessment of railway artillery praised its ruggedness, ease of manufacture and convenience in service, but acknowledged its unsuitability for smaller guns, due to excessive time of operation and lack of traverse, and that it was not suitable for the largest howitzers firing at high angles because of the enormous trunnion forces. With rolling recoil the entire gun, mount, and carriage rolls backward, typically between , restrained only by the brakes. The mount was winched back into firing position by cables fastened to the track. This system was usually combined with cradle recoil because the springs of the trucks cannot withstand the vertical component of the recoil force alone. This type of mount was usually fitted with car-traverse. It was unsuitable for smaller guns due to the lack of traverse. The great advantage of this method is that it requires minimal preparation and can fire from any suitable section of curved track.Miller vol. I, p. 69 This French 274 mm howitzer used a combination of top-cradle and sliding recoil. The methods were often used in combination with each other. Examples include the French railway howitzer which used cradle-sliding recoil. The Americans' 14\\"/50 caliber railway gun Mark II used cradle-rolling recoil as did the 14 and 12 inch railway guns from Great Britain. Only the oldest weapons used a combination of top-cradle and sliding recoil. One example being the earliest mounts for the British designed BL 9.2 inch Railway Gun. = Anchorage = No anchorage needed (top); truck platform anchorage (middle); ground platform anchorage (bottom) St Chamond 240 mm Canon de Mle 1893/96, WWI, using ground platform anchorage The combination of rolling and cradle-recoil methods absorbed both the horizontal and vertical components of the recoil force and needed no special preparations, but all other types required some method to transmit the vertical force to the ground. One way is to build a platform on either the ties or the ground with girders, beams, pads or floats. The horizontal component would be alleviated by either sliding recoil or rail clamps, guys or struts to secure the mount in place. The French Schneider and mounts and the British 9.2 inch guns and 12 inch howitzers used rail clamps or guys. The American gun and the French 240 mm Canon de Mle 1893/96 M used struts. The other method is build a firing position and recoil pit (√©pi de tir in French) underneath the tracks, using either heavy timbers like the French and howitzers or an elaborate concrete or steel base. These latter were mostly used by the Germans for the and larger railway guns and by the French for their Batignollesmounts. Generally, for these emplacements the rails merely served to guide the gun into position and the gun was often mounted on a central pivot to allow up to 360¬∞ of traverse. The primary drawback of these positions was the lengthy time to build them.  History  = 19th century = The idea of railway guns was first suggested in Russia in 1847 by Gustav Kori (proposal), http://www.travelzone.lv/lib/zd_puski/index.php followed by Ye. Repin (project, 1855), Pyotr Lebedev (who outlined the theoretical foundations of the railway artillery in Primeneniye Zheleznykh Dorog k Zashite Materika, 1857) and P. Fomin (developed a project of a large-caliber cannon, 1860).  American Civil War  A 32-pounder Brooke naval rifle railway gun used in the American Civil War The \\"Dictator\\", Petersburg (Mathew Brady) The first railway gun used in combat was a banded 32-pounder Brooke naval rifle mounted on a flat car and shielded by a sloping casemate of railroad iron. On 29 June 1862, Robert E. Lee had the gun pushed by a locomotive over the Richmond and York River line (later part of the Southern Railway) and used at the Battle of Savage's Station to interfere with General George McClellan's plans for siege operations against Richmond during the Union advance up the peninsula.Phillips, p. 225 Photographic evidence exists of at least one Union 13-inch siege mortar mounted on a rail car during the Siege of Petersburg. It was nicknamed the Dictator or the Petersburg Express.Miller vol. I, pp. 9-16 When it was first fired, the recoil destroyed the flatcar on which it was mounted.Jack H. McCall, Jr., When Railroad Guns Ruled, Historynet; accessed 2017.10.29. A flatcar strengthened by additional beams covered by iron plate was able to resist recoil damage from a full charge. The Dictator was then fired from a section of the Petersburg and City Point Railroad where moving the strengthened flatcar along a curve in the track trained the gun on different targets along the Confederate lines. The Dictator silenced the Confederate guns on Chesterfield Heights to prevent them from enfilading the right end of the Union line. Another photo exists of a gun mounted on an armoured rail car with the caption of \\"Railway battery used in siege of Petersburg\\" although no textual evidence survives in support of the caption, which makes the claim that it is a photo of the Confederate gun from 1862 dubious.  France  France also used improvised railway guns during the Siege of Paris (1870‚Äì1871).Tucker, S. C. (2005). The encyclopedia of world war I: A political, social, and military history. Abc-clio. In France, Lt. Col Peign√© is often credited with designing the first railway gun in 1883. Commandant Mougin is credited with putting guns on rail cars in 1870. The French arms maker Schneider offered a number of models in the late 1880s and produced a gun intended for coastal defense, selling some to the Danish government in the 1890s. They also designed a model the Obusier de 200 \\"P√©rou\\" sur aff√ªt-truck TAZ Schneider for Peru in 1910, but they were never delivered.Miller vol. I, pp. 17, 23  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom mounted a few guns on railway cars which saw action during the Siege and Relief of Ladysmith during the Second Boer War.Miller vol. I, p. 23 A 9.2 inch gun was taken from the Cape Town coast defences and mounted on a rail car to support the British assault on Boer defenses at Belfast, north-east of Johannesburg, but the battle ended before it could get into action.Hall = World War I = The outbreak of the First World War caught the French with a shortage of heavy field artillery. In compensation, large numbers of large static coastal defense guns and naval guns were moved to the front, but these were typically unsuitable for field use and required some kind of mounting. The railway gun provided the obvious solution. By 1916, both sides were deploying numerous types of railway guns.Miller vol. II, pp. 1‚Äì186 ;France During the First World War France produced more railway guns in more calibers and with different mountings than everyone else combined. The largest French gun produce by Schneider of France the Obusier de 520 mod√®le 1916, a 20-inch (520 mm) railway \\"Fort Buster\\" to do what the German 16.53-inch Big Bertha had done at the outbreak of World War I and reduce the German forts in the final line of German defenses. One was destroyed in trials and the other did not complete firing trials prior to the signing of the Armistice. The gun remained in storage and was captured by the Germans during World War II. It later formed part of the German artillery complement during the Siege of Leningrad. The gun was disabled by a premature detonation and later abandoned. ;United States WWI era U.S. Navy 14\\" railway gun at Sandy Hook, New Jersey Baldwin Locomotive Works delivered five 14\\"/50 caliber railway guns on trains for the United States Navy during April and May 1918. Each 14\\"/50 gun mounted on a , rail carriage with four 6-wheel bogies was under the command of a United States Navy lieutenant with a standard U.S. Army 2-8-0 locomotive, a 10-ton crane car, two armored ammunition cars carrying 25 shells each, two cars carrying the recoil pit foundation materials, two fuel and workshop cars, three berthing cars, a kitchen car, a commissary car, and a medical dispensary car. A sixth locomotive pulled a headquarters car for Rear Admiral Charles Peshall Plunkett, with a machine-shop car, a spare parts car, a berthing car, a kitchen car, a commissary car, and a medical dispensary car. After delivery by ship, these trains were assembled in St. Nazaire in AugustMany, April 1965, p.53 and fired a total of 782 shells during 25 days on the Western Front at ranges between . Each projectile weighed and was fired at per second. The railway carriages could elevate the guns to 43 degrees, but elevations over 15 degrees required excavation of a pit with room for the gun to recoil and structural steel shoring foundations to prevent caving of the pit sides from recoil forces absorbed by the surrounding soil.Westing (1966) pp.79-80 The trains moved cautiously because axle loading under the gun barrels was while French railways were designed for a maximum of . These axle journals overheated at speeds of more than per hour. After reaching its intended firing site and constructing the recoil pit, each gun could fire about two shells per hour. One of these guns was retained after the War as an ammunition test gun at the Dahlgren Weapons Laboratory until all United States battleships with 14\\"/50 guns were scrapped shortly after World War II. The gun was then placed on display outside the U.S. Navy Museum at the Washington Navy Yard. Baldwin constructed six similar gun carriages and two of an improved Mk II type designed to permit firing the gun at all elevation angles without transferring weight to a separate foundation. These eight guns were completed too late to see combat, and were designated the 14-inch M1920 railway guns. Some were later stationed through World War II in special coast defense installations at San Pedro, California, (near Los Angeles) and in the Panama Canal Zone where they could be shifted from one ocean to the other in less than a day. Improved carriages were designed to allow their transportation to several fixed firing emplacements including concrete foundations where the railway trucks were withdrawn so the gun could be rapidly traversed (swiveled horizontally) to engage moving ship targets.Lewis (1979) pp. 103, 106 After the American entry into World War I on 6 April 1917, the U.S. Army recognized the need to adopt railway artillery for use on the Western Front. No US railway guns existed at that time. Due to low production and shipping priorities, the Army's railway gun contribution on the Western Front consisted of four U.S. Coast Artillery regiments armed with French-made weapons. Three additional railway gun regiments were in France, but did not complete training prior to the Armistice, and they did not see action. Other Coast Artillery units also operated various types of French-, British-, and American-made heavy artillery. The Army also converted some of the numerous coast artillery weapons to railway mounts. A total of 96 8-inch guns (including some from Navy spares), 129 10-inch guns, 45 12-inch guns, and 150 12-inch mortars could be spared from fixed coast defense batteries or spare stocks. Twelve 7-inch ex- Navy guns and six 12-inch guns being built for Chile were also available. To shorten a long story, none of these weapons were shipped to France except three 8-inch guns, as few of any type were completed before the Armistice. Forty-seven 8-inch railway guns were ordered, with 18 completed by the Armistice and a total of 37 (or 47, references vary) completed before the contract was canceled. Eight 10-inch railway mounts of 54 ordered were completed by the Armistice, and twelve 12-inch railway mounts were completed by 1 April 1919; the 12-inch contract was cancelled at that point. At least some of the 10-inch gun barrels were shipped to France and mounted on French- made carriages, but sources do not indicate any use of them in combat. Three railway mountings for the Chilean 12-inch guns were ready for shipment by the Armistice, and the remaining three barrels were kept as spares. A total of twenty-two 10-inch guns were eventually mounted. Ninety-one 12-inch railway mortars were ordered, with 45 complete by 7 April 1919 and the remainder eventually completed. The 7-inch and 8-inch guns and 12-inch mortars used a common carriage, with a depressed center and two 4-wheel or 6-wheel bogies. The bogies were interchangeable for standard-gauge or (with 12-wheel bogies) 60-cm (23.6-inch) gauge track.Miller, H. W., LTC, USA Railway Artillery, Vols. I and II, 1921, Vol. I, pp. 131-155 Outriggers and a rotating mount allowed all-around fire. This allowed the weapons to be used in coast defense against moving targets. The 8-inch guns and 12-inch mortars were kept on railway mountings after the war, while almost all of the 7-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch guns were returned to the coastal forts. With 47 available, plus an additional 24 ex-Navy Mark VI guns on railway mounts by 1942, the 8-inch guns were the most-commonly-deployed American railway gun through World War II. About 12 of these were used for the defense of Oahu, Hawaii. Others were stationed for the coastal defense of Manila (eventually dismounted from the railway carriage at Corregidor), Bermuda, Newfoundland, Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and Fort Hancock, New Jersey (near New York City).Lewis (1979) pp. 102-110, 140-141Berhow, pp. 199-228 Although numerous 12-inch railway mortars were available, few were deployed. In 1930 the US Army tested them at Fort Hancock, New Jersey, and Fort Miles, Delaware.\\"Mortar Railway Gun to Aid in Defending Coast\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1930 During World War II, four railway mortars were among the temporary harbor defenses of Grays Harbor, Washington state, and emplacements for an additional four at Cape George, Washington, were constructed, but never armed.Berhow, pp. 216-217 Of the more than 250 railway guns built in the United States from 1916 to 1942, the five navy 14\\"/50 guns that were sent to France during World War I and possibly two 8-inch guns in the Philippines were the only ones ever to be used in combat.

Arcadius was author of Russian Economic History, The Nineteenth Century] also The Plow the Hammer and the Knout The latter book presents his explanation of the foundation in the Eighteenth Century of the Russian economy and power structure. Kahan had been a student in the Communist Party when the Nazis invaded his country, Poland, in 1939. He joined an underground group which engaged in acts of sabotage and which struggled not to be caught, a group in which he became a leader. After the Soviet army pushed the Nazis out of Poland, he expected to help in forming a new government. Instead, the Soviets set up their own state within Poland. Kahan faced severe persecution that included a stay in the Treblinka prison, a prison and reeducation facility used by the Soviets which was on the site of a wartime extermination camp. Kahan was forced to leave Eastern Europe. After his arrival in the United States he earned a Masters in 1954 and Ph.D. in 1958 in Economics from Rutgers University. He joined the Economics faculty at the University of Chicago in 1955. As a member of the Economics Department at the University of Chicago, Kahan straddled a fine line between the principles which he brought from his socialist youth and the neoclassical school of economic thought associated with the Department. He won the confidence of Milton Friedman with his work on the economic effects of the persecution of Jews in 19th century Russia. Kahan concluded that this had a significant impact on Russia's economic backwardness, particularly as compared with western Europe. He argued that this was an example of dysfunctional governmental interference in the economy, which drew on the methodology of the neoliberals in the Chicago school.

() is a mountain near Gweedore in County Donegal, Ireland. It is the tallest peak of the Derryveagh Mountains and the tallest peak in County Donegal. Geography Errigal is the most southern, steepest and highest of the mountain chain, called the \\"Seven Sisters\\". The Seven Sisters includes Muckish, Crocknalaragagh, Aghla Beg, Ardloughnabrackbaddy, Aghla More, Mackoght and Errigal. The nearest peak is Mackoght (from Irish: Mac Uchta, meaning \\"son of the mountain-breast\\") which is also known as Little Errigal or Wee Errigal (). Errigal is known for the pinkish glow of its quartzite in the setting sun. Another noted quality is the ever-changing shape of the mountain depending on what direction you view it from. Errigal was voted 'Ireland's Most Iconic Mountain' by Walking & Hiking Ireland in 2009. Naming Errigal is in legend said to have been named by the Fir Bolg who, originating in Greece, came to worship Errigal as they had Mount Olympus. The name comes from the Latin (to pray) and the Greek (church). Scholars consider it one of the oldest placenames in Ireland. A more prosaic origin for the name is from the Old Irish airecal, meaning \\"oratory\\". There is no remains of an oratory on the mountain, so it may refer to the mountain as a whole as a place of prayer.http://www.mountaineering.ie/_files/Paul%20Tempan%20Irish%20Mountain%20Placenames%20-%20Feb%202012.pdf In recent years, there have been numerous erroneous references to Mount Errigal. In 2016, Ireland's national tourism authority, F√°ilte Ireland, apologised for using the name \\"Mount Errigal\\" in its brochure, rather than the proper name. The official name is An Earagail or Errigal. Mount Errigal is the name of a hotel in Letterkenny, County Donegal. Hill walking The mountain is most often climbed from the car park off the R251 road. The route initially starts off by crossing heavily eroded and boggy land towards a visible track through the shiny scree from where the ascent proper starts. After reaching the summit, people usually walk the short but exposed walk along One Man's Pass which leads across to the second and lower of the twin summits. No special equipment is needed to climb the mountain, but caution is advised. In popular culture * In the 1985 music video, \\"In A Lifetime\\" by Clannad and Bono, several images of Errigal appear. * In 1990, Errigal features prominently in the music video for The Chills' song, \\"Heavenly Pop Hit\\". * In the 1991 song by Goats Don't Shave called \\"Las Vegas (In the Hills of Donegal)\\" contains the line, \\"To stand on top of Errigal, would give me such a thrill\\". * In the 2008 film Hunger, the main protagonist Bobby Sands describes Errigal as a \\"beautiful sight\\". * In the 2011 movie Your Highness, several scenes were shot on Errigal * In 2012, Irish composer Vincent Kennedy, as part of his music for The Happy Prince, titled a piece: \\"Snowfall on Errigal\\" * The song \\"Gleannt√°in Ghlas' Ghaoth Dobhair\\", written by Proinsias √ì Maonaigh, begins with the lines: ::\\"C√©ad sl√°n ag sl√©ibhte maorga Chondae Dh√∫n na nGall / Agus dh√° ch√©ad sl√°n ag an Earagal √°rd / Ina stua os cionn caor 's call\\".

See p. 454. Both directed and undirected versions of rooted graphs have been studied, and there are also variant definitions that allow multiple roots. Rooted graphs may also be known (depending on their application) as pointed graphs or flow graphs. In some of the applications of these graphs, there is an additional requirement that the whole graph be reachable from the root vertex. Variations In topological graph theory, the notion of a rooted graph may be extended to consider multiple vertices or multiple edges as roots. The former are sometimes called vertex-rooted graphs in order to distinguish them from edge- rooted graphs in this context. Graphs with multiple nodes designated as roots are also of some interest in combinatorics, in the area of random graphs. These graphs are also called multiply rooted graphs.. The terms rooted directed graph or rooted digraph also see variation in definitions. The obvious transplant is to consider a digraph rooted by identifying a particular node as root.. See in particular p. 307. However, in computer science, these terms commonly refer to a narrower notion, namely a rooted directed graph is a digraph with a distinguished node r, such that there is a directed path from r to any node other than r.. See in particular p. 122.. See in particular p. 524.. See in particular p. 308. Authors which give the more general definition, may refer to these as connected (or 1-connected) rooted digraphs. The Art of Computer Programming defines rooted digraphs slightly more broadly, namely a directed graph is called rooted if it has at least one node that can reach all the other nodes; Knuth notes that the notion thus defined is a sort of intermediate between the notions of strongly connected and connected digraph. Applications =Flow graphs= In computer science, rooted graphs in which the root vertex can reach all other vertices are called flow graphs or flowgraphs.. Sometimes an additional restriction is added specifying that a flow graph must have a single exit (sink) vertex as well.. Flow graphs may be viewed as abstractions of flow charts, with the non-structural elements (node contents and types) removed. Perhaps the best known sub-class of flow graphs are control flow graphs, used in compilers and program analysis. An arbitrary flow graph may converted to a control flow graph by performing an edge contraction on every edge that is the only outgoing edge from its source and the only incoming edge into its target. Another type of flow graph commonly used is the call graph, in which nodes correspond to entire subroutines. The general notion of flow graph has been called program graph, but the same term has also been used to denote only control flow graphs. Flow graphs have also been called unlabeled flowgraphs, and proper flowgraphs. These graphs are sometimes used in software testing. When required to have a single exit, flow graphs have two properties not shared with directed graphs in general. Flow graphs can be nested, which is the equivalent of a subroutine call (although there is no notion of passing parameters), and flow graphs can also be sequenced, which is the equivalent of sequential execution of two pieces of code.. Prime flow graphs are defined as flow graphs that cannot be decomposed via nesting or sequencing using a chosen pattern of subgraphs, for example the primitives of structured programming.. Theoretical research has been done on determining, for example, the proportion of prime flow graphs given a chosen set of graphs. =Set theory= Peter Aczel has used rooted directed graphs such that every node is reachable from the root (which he calls accessible pointed graphs) to formulate Aczel's anti-foundation axiom in non-well-founded set theory. In this context, each vertex of an accessible pointed graph models a (non-well-founded) set within Aczel's non-well-foundet set theory, and an arc from a vertex v to a vertex w models that v is an element of w. Aczel's anti-foundation axiom states that every accessible pointed graph models a family of (non-well-founded) sets in this way. =Combinatorial game theory= Given a purely combinatorial game, there is an associated rooted directed graph whose vertices are game positions and whose edges are moves, and graph traversal starting from the root is used to create a game tree. If the graph contains directed cycles, then a position in the game could repeat infinitely many times, and rules are usually needed to prevent the game from continuing indefinitely. Otherwise, the graph is a directed acyclic graph, and if it isn't a rooted tree, then the game has transpositions. This graph and its topology is important in the study of game complexity, where the state-space complexity is the number of vertices in the graph, the average game length is the average number of vertices traversed from the root to a vertex with no direct successors, and the average branching factor of a game tree is the average outdegree of the graph. Combinatorial enumeration The number of rooted undirected graphs for 1, 2, ... nodes is 1, 2, 6, 20, 90, 544, ... Related concepts A special case of interest are rooted trees, the trees with a distinguished root vertex. If the directed paths from the root in the rooted digraph are additionally restricted to be unique, then the notion obtained is that of (rooted) arborescence‚Äîthe directed-graph equivalent of a rooted tree. A rooted graph contains an arborescence with the same root if and only if the whole graph can be reached from the root, and computer scientists have studied algorithmic problems of finding optimal arborescences.. Rooted graphs may be combined using the rooted product of graphs.

She later known as Wu Zetian). Emperor Gaozong was the son of Emperor Taizong and Empress Zhangsun. His reign saw the primacy of the Empress Wu, who became the effective power behind the Tang rule. Emperor Gaozong was aided in his rule by Empress Wu during the later years of his reign after a series of strokes left him incapacitated. Emperor Gaozong effectively after January 665 delegated all matters of state to his Strong wife and Empress Wu is therefore unique in the annals of the Tang Empire for the political influence she wielded. In fact, after year 665, Emperor Gaozong no longer ruled and he in all matters fell heavily under the influence of his Empress consort, Empress Wu, who came to have total control of the imperial administration. Gaozong's affection and trust of Wu led to her wielding a great deal of power in affairs of state. Gaozong's disease made it easier for Empress Wu to exert her influence. For many years, she effectively wielded imperial power and was recognized as the real force behind the Tang throne. She sat alongside her husband on the imperial meetings to receive audiences, issued orders, and consulted with ministers and chancellors. Empress Wu's excessive power, effectively, displayed the wrath of Crown Prince Li Hong, and Emperor Gaozong decided to abdicate in favor of his eldest son, but took no real action for fear of his wife. After Emperor Gaozong died in 683, power fell completely and solely into the hands of Empress Wu, who subsequently became the only Empress regnant in Chinese history. After his death, he was interred at the Qianling Mausoleum along with Wu Zetian. Historians have generally viewed Emperor Gaozong as a weak ruler, inattentive to the business of the state and because he was always controlled by his wife was criticized and leaving such rule business to his powerful wife Empress Wu. During the first part of his reign, Tang territorial gains, which started with his father Emperor Taizong, continued, including the conquest of Baekje, Goguryeo, and the Western Turkic Khaganate, but throughout the 670s, much of those gains were lost to the Tibetan Empire, Silla, Khitan, and Balhae. Further, territory previously conquered that belonged to both the G√∂kt√ºrks and the Western Turkic Khaganate were subjected to repeated rebellions. Background and life as Prince of Jin Li Zhi was born in 628. He was the ninth son of his father, Emperor Taizong, and the third son of his mother, Emperor Taizong's wife Empress Zhangsun. In 631, he was created the Prince of Jin. In 633, he was made commandant of Bing Prefecture (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), but remained at the capital Chang'an rather than reporting to Bing Prefecture. When Empress Zhangsun died in 636, Emperor Taizong was particularly touched by the grief that Li Zhi displayed, and from that point on particularly favored him. Sometime while he was the Prince of Jin, at the recommendation of his grand aunt Princess Tong'an, he married the grandniece of Princess Tong'an's husband Wang Yu () as his wife and princess. Meanwhile, Li Zhi's two older brothers by Empress Zhangsun, Li Chengqian the Crown Prince and Li Tai the Prince of Wei, were locked in an intense rivalry, as Li Tai was favored by Emperor Taizong for his talent and was trying to displace Li Chengqian. Li Chengqian, in fear, entered into a conspiracy with the general Hou Junji, his uncle Li Yuanchang () the Prince of Han, the imperial guard commander Li Anyan (), and his brothers-in-law Zhao Jie (Ë∂ôÁØÄ, who was also his cousin) and Du He () to overthrow Emperor Taizong. The plot was discovered in 643, and Emperor Taizong deposed Li Chengqian. He was initially going to make Li Tai the new crown prince, but later began to believe that Li Tai's machinations were responsible for Li Chengqian's downfall. The powerful chancellor Zhangsun Wuji ‚Äì Empress Zhangsun's brother‚Äîsuggested that he make Li Zhi crown prince, a possibility that Li Tai was apprehensive about. Li Tai tried to intimidate Li Zhi, who had been friendly with Li Yuanchang, by pointing out to Li Zhi that Li Yuanchang had been part of the plot and that he should be concerned for himself. When Emperor Taizong noticed Li Zhi worrying about this and was told by Li Zhi of Li Tai's intimidation, Emperor Taizong's mind became set. He exiled Li Tai, and on 30 April 643,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ he created Li Zhi the new crown prince. He made Zhangsun and two other senior chancellors, Fang Xuanling and Xiao Yu, senior advisors to Li Zhi, and made another chancellor, Li Shiji, the head of Li Zhi's household. At the advice of another key official, Liu Ji, who pointed out that the crown prince needed to have a group of well-learned scholars that he was close to, Emperor Taizong appointed Liu, as well as Cen Wenben, Chu Suiliang, and Ma Zhou, to serve as Li Zhi's friends and advisors. As Crown Prince Late in 643, Emperor Taizong issued an edict to select beautiful women among good households to serve as Li Zhi's concubines. However, after Li Zhi declined such treatment, Emperor Taizong cancelled the edict. However, during his years as crown prince, he was said to have favored his concubine Consort Xiao, having two daughters (the later Princesses Yiyang and Xuan Cheng) and one son (Li Sujie) with her, much to the chagrin of his wife Crown Princess Wang, who was childless and jealous of Consort Xiao. Three other concubines of his bore his other sons Li Zhong, Li Xiao (), and Li Shangjin (). Around the same time, however, Emperor Taizong also became concerned that Li Zhi, who was considered kind but weak in character, would not be strong enough to be an emperor, and secretly discussed with Zhangsun Wuji the possibility of making another son by his concubine Consort Yang (daughter of Emperor Yang of Sui), Li Ke the Prince of Wu, crown prince. Zhangsun repeatedly opposed the idea, and Emperor Taizong did not carry this out. In 645, when Emperor Taizong launched a campaign against Goguryeo, he took Li Zhi with him to Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei) and then left Li Zhi there to be in charge of logistics, before heading to the front himself. He also left senior officials Gao Shilian, Liu Ji, Ma Zhou, Zhang Xingcheng, and Gao Jifu to assist Li Zhi. After the campaign ended in failure later that year, as Emperor Taizong was leading the army back from the front, Li Zhi went to meet him at Linyu Pass (Ëá®Ê∏ùÈóú, now Shanhai Pass). Emperor Taizong suffered an injury during the campaign, and Li Zhi was said to have, as Emperor Taizong's conditions were getting worse, sucked the pus out of his wound, until Emperor Taizong recovered somewhat. In 646, with Emperor Taizong still recovering, he transferred some of the imperial authorities to Li Zhi. Li Zhi stayed at the imperial palace and attended to Emperor Taizong in his illness. That year, when Emperor Taizong was due to visit Ling Prefecture (ÈùàÂ∑û, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia) to meet with a number of tribal chiefs who were formerly vassals of Xueyantuo‚Äîwhich had collapsed under Tang and Huige attacks earlier that year‚Äîhe was set to take Li Zhi with him, but at Zhang's suggestion left Li Zhi in charge at Chang'an instead, to allow Li Zhi to become more familiar with the important affairs of state in his absence. After Emperor Taizong returned from Ling Prefecture, he retained for himself the authorities over imperial worship, state guests, military, the commissioning of officers of higher than the fifth rank, and executions, and transferred all other authorities to Li Zhi. In 647, a commoner named Duan Zhichong () submitted a petition to Emperor Taizong, asking him to pass the throne to Li Zhi. Li Zhi, concerned that Emperor Taizong might be offended, was worried and grieving, and Zhangsun suggested that Duan be executed. Emperor Taizong did not take offense and did not punish Duan or Li Zhi. Meanwhile, Li Zhi began to build a Buddhist temple named Daci'en Temple () in commemoration of his mother Empress Zhangsun, and the temple was completed in 648. In 649, while at the summer palace Cuiwei Palace (Áø†ÂæÆÂÆÆ, in the Qin Mountains), Emperor Taizong was gravely ill, and he, while impressed with Li Shiji's abilities, was concerned that Li Shiji was too able and would not submit to Li Zhi. He stated to Li Zhi: He then demoted Li Shiji to the post of the commandant of Die Prefecture (ÁñäÂ∑û, roughly modern Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu). Li Shiji, realizing what was happening, after receiving the order, departed without hesitation. As Emperor Taizong's illness was getting more serious, Li Zhi continuously attended to him and wept constantly, often going without food, which touched Emperor Taizong greatly. Emperor Taizong entrusted Li Zhi to Zhangsun and Chu Suiliang, and then died on 10 July 649.ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Initially, Li Zhi was so mournful that he could not carry out any actions other than holding onto the necks of Zhangsun and Chu. Zhangsun, while mourning himself, reminded Li Zhi that he was now in charge of the empire and must act accordingly. Zhangsun also ordered that Emperor Taizong's death not be announced for the time being, and then, the next day, accompanied Li Zhi back to Chang'an. Zhangsun issued several edicts in Emperor Taizong's name‚Äîincluding making Yu Zhining, Zhang, and Gao Jifu chancellors. Two days later, Emperor Taizong's death was officially announced. On 15 July,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Li Zhi took the throne (as Emperor Gaozong). Reign as Emperor During his 34-year reign, he was unable to exercise power alone and was under the control of several of his great ministers and his beloved wife, Empress Wu. The order of the regents were: *Zhangsun Wuji and Yu Zhining (649-659) *Han Yuan, Lai Ji and Liu Shi (649-658) *Li Ji and Chu Suiliang (649-658) *Empress Wu (660-683) =Early reign: Political struggles= Yonghui era (650‚Äì656) Emperor Gaozong's first move as emperor was to cancel a second campaign against Goguryeo that Emperor Taizong had planned for later 649. While Li Tai was disallowed from attending Emperor Taizong's funeral, Emperor Gaozong permitted him to again have a staff and be allowed to use wagons, clothes, and foods of high quality. Emperor Gaozong created his wife Crown Princess Wang empress and made her father Wang Renyou () the Duke of Wei. It was said that early in Emperor Gaozong's reign, he greatly respected both his uncle Zhangsun Wuji and Chu Suiliang and followed their advice, and that therefore, during this part of his reign, the government was organized well and the people were comforted, much like during the reign of Emperor Taizong, although in winter 650, Chu was accused of forcibly purchasing private land and paying below-market price, and was demoted to be a prefectural prefect. (Chu eventually returned to power in 653.) Also in 650, the general Gao Kan () ‚Äì whose army had been launched by Emperor Taizong against the newly reconstituted G√∂kt√ºrk state under Chebi Khan Ashina Hubo prior to Emperor Taizong's death‚Äîcaptured Ashina Hubo and brought him back to Chang'an. Emperor Gaozong spared Ashina Hubo and made him a general, putting his people directly under Tang rule. Meanwhile, with two of the states of the Western Regions previously conquered by Tang and governed by Tang-installed kings, Kucha and Karasahr in disturbance, Emperor Taizong returned their previously-captured kings, Bai Helibushibi () and Long Tuqizhi () respectively, to their thrones. In 651, the Western Turkic Khaganate prince Ashina Helu, who had sought and received protection from Emperor Taizong, broke away from Tang and defeated the Western Turkic Khaganate's Yipishekui Khan, taking over the Western Turkic Khaganate himself and no longer subordinate under Tang. In fall 651, Ashina Helu attacked Tang's Ting Prefecture (Â∫≠Â∑û, roughly Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang), and Emperor Gaozong responded by commissioning the generals Liang Jianfang () and Qibi Heli () to attack Ashina Helu. Liang and Qibi achieved some victories against Ashina Helu's general Zhuxie Guzhu (), but then withdrew without engaging Ashina Helu. Meanwhile, as Empress Wang was sonless, her uncle, the chancellor Liu Shi, suggested to her that she ask Emperor Gaozong to create his oldest son Li Zhong, whose mother Consort Liu was of low birth and therefore considered nonthreatening, crown prince so that Li Zhong would be grateful of her in the future. Liu also persuaded Zhangsun to suggest the idea as well, and in fall 652, Emperor Gaozong created Li Zhong crown prince. By this point, however, Empress Wang was facing a major threat from another romantic rival. When Emperor Gaozong was crown prince, he had an affair with one of Emperor Taizong's concubines, Consort Wu. After Emperor Taizong's death, all of his concubines who did not bear sons, which included Wu, were housed at Ganye Temple () to be Buddhist nuns. In either 650 or 651,The modern historian Bo Yang, based on the fact that Empress Wu's oldest son Li Hong was born in 652, fixed the date of this incident as 650, but 651 is also a possibility. See Bo Yang Edition of Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 47. Emperor Gaozong was visiting Ganye Temple to offer incense to Buddha when he saw Consort Wu. Both of them wept. When Empress Wang heard this, she, wanting to divert Emperor Gaozong's favor from Consort Xiao, secretly instructed Consort Wu to grow her hair back, while suggesting to Emperor Gaozong that he take her as a concubine. Consort Wu was intelligent and full of machinations, and therefore, when she first returned to the palace, she acted humbly and flattered Empress Wang, who trusted her greatly and recommended her to Emperor Gaozong. Soon, Emperor Gaozong became enamored with Consort Wu. Meanwhile, Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Gaoyang and her husband Fang Yi'ai (ÊàøÈÅ∫ÊÑõ, Fang Xuanling's son), were implicated in 652 of conspiring with another brother-in-law Chai Lingwu (), the general Xue Wanche () and Emperor Gaozong's uncle Li Yuanjing () the Prince of Jing to make Li Yuanjing emperor. Fang, knowing that Zhangsun had long been apprehensive of Li Ke, falsely implicated Li Ke in the plot as well, hoping to ingratiate Zhangsun sufficiently that he would be spared. nevertheless, in spring 653, at the suggestion of Zhangsun and Cui Dunli ‚Äì despite Emperor Gaozong's initial inclination to spare Li Yuanjing and Li Ke‚ÄîEmperor Gaozong ordered that Fang, Xue, and Chai be executed, and that Li Yuanjing, Li Ke, and the Princesses Gaoyang and Baling (Chai's wife) be forced to commit suicide. Zhangsun took this opportunity to accuse several other officials friendly with Fang or hostile to him‚Äîthe chancellor Yuwen Jie, Li Daozong the Prince of Jiangxia, and the general Zhishi Sili () ‚Äì of being friendly with Fang and had them exiled. He also deposed and exiled Li Ke's mother Consort Yang and Consort Yang's other son Li Yin () the Prince of Shu, as well as Fang's brother Fang Yizhi () and Xue's brother Xue Wanbei (). By 654, both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao had lost favor with Emperor Gaozong, and the former romantic rivals joined forces against Consort Wu, but to no avail, and as a sign of his love to Consort Wu, in 654 he conferred posthumous honors on her father Wu Shihuo (). Later that year, Consort Wu gave birth to a daughter that died shortly after birth. Evidence implicated Empress Wang as the killer, although some historians believe Consort Wu killed her own daughter in order to frame Empress Wang, but no concrete evidence of this exists. In anger, Emperor Gaozong considered deposing Empress Wang and replacing her with Consort Wu, but wanted to make sure that the chancellors would support this, and so visited Zhangsun's house with Consort Wu, awarding him with much treasure, but when he brought up the topic that Empress Wang was sonless (as an excuse for deposing her), Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation, and subsequent visits by Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and the official Xu Jingzong, who was allied with Consort Wu, to seek support from Zhangsun were also to no avail. In summer 655, Consort Wu accused Empress Wang and her mother Lady Liu of using witchcraft. In response, Emperor Gaozong barred Lady Liu from the palace and demoted Liu Shi. Meanwhile, a faction of officials began to form around Consort Wu, including Li Yifu, Xu, Cui Yixuan (), and Yuan Gongyu (). On an occasion in fall 655, Emperor Gaozong summoned the chancellors Zhangsun, Li Shiji (who by now was using the name Li Ji to observe naming taboo for Emperor Taizong's name Li Shimin), Yu Zhining, and Chu to the palace‚Äîwhich Chu deduced to be regarding the matter of changing the empress. Li Ji claimed an illness and refused to attend. At the meeting, Chu vehemently opposed deposing Empress Wang, while Zhangsun and Yu showed their disapproval by silence. Meanwhile, other chancellors Han Yuan and Lai Ji also opposed the move, but when Emperor Gaozong asked Li Ji again, Li Ji's response was, \\"This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?\\" Emperor Gaozong therefore became resolved. He demoted Chu to be a commandant at Tan Prefecture (roughly modern Changsha, Hunan), and then deposed both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, putting them under arrest and creating Consort Wu empress instead to replace Empress Wang. (Later that year, Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were killed on orders by the new Empress Wu after Emperor Gaozong showed signs of considering their release.) Then, at Xu's suggestion, in spring 656, Emperor Gaozong demoted Li Zhong to be the Prince of Liang and created Empress Wu's oldest son Li Hong the Prince of Dai crown prince instead. In 655 as well, Emperor Gaozong commissioned the general Cheng Zhijie () to attack Ashina Helu, but while the campaign saw some victories over Western Turkic Khaganate's substituent tribes Geluolu () and Chuyue (), it was hindered by Cheng's inability to restrain his assistant Wang Wendu () from pillaging and inappropriately halting the army. After the campaign ended in early 657, both Cheng and Wang were deposed from their offices. Xianqing era (656‚Äì661) In 657, Emperor Gaozong commissioned the general Su Dingfang, who had served under Cheng Zhijie in the earlier failed campaign, to command a campaign against Ashina Helu, assisted by Ren Yaxiang and Xiao Siye (). They were joined by the Western Turkic Khaganate‚Äôs leaders Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen, who had submitted to Tang during Emperor Taizong's reign. The campaign caught Ashina Helu by surprise, and Su defeated him in several battles, causing him to flee to the kingdom Shi (Áü≥Âúã, centering modern Tashkent, Uzbekistan), which arrested him and delivered him to Su, thus largely ending the Western Turkic Khaganate as an organized state. (Emperor Gaozong would try to continue the Western Turkic Khaganate's existence as a vassal stage by dividing it in half and creating Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen as khans of the two halves.) Meanwhile, Xu Jingzong and Li Yifu, aligned with Empress Wu, began to carry out a campaign of reprisal on her behalf. In 657, they accused Han Yuan and Lai Ji of plotting treason with Chu Suiliang, who was then serving as the commandant at Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi). Emperor Gaozong demoted Han and Lai to be prefects of distant prefectures, and demoted Chu and Liu Shi to even more distant prefectures‚Äîin Chu's case, to the extremely distant Ai Prefecture (ÊÑõÂ∑û, roughly modern Thanh H√≥a Province, Vietnam), and Chu's subsequent petition, sent from Ai Prefecture, pleading with Emperor Gaozong, fell on deaf ears. Empress Wu's reprisals did not end there. In 659, Zhangsun Wuji became the next target. At that time, two low level officials, Wei Jifang () and Li Chao () had been accused of improper associations, and when Emperor Gaozong put Xu and Xin Maojiang of investigating, Xu falsely accused Wei and Li to be part of a treasonous plot by Zhangsun. Emperor Gaozong, without meeting with Zhangsun, believed Xu, and put Zhangsun under house arrest in exile at Qian Prefecture (ÈªîÂ∑û, roughly modern southeastern Chongqing). Xu further implicated Chu, Liu, Han, and Yu Zhining in the plot as well. Yu was removed from his post. Chu, who had died in 658, was posthumously stripped of all titles, and his sons Chu Yanfu () and Chu Yanchong () were executed. Orders were also issued to execute Liu and Han, although Han died before the execution order reached his location. Meanwhile, Zhangsun, once he reached his place of exile, was forced to commit suicide. It was said that after Han's and Lai's deaths, no official dared to criticize the emperor any further. Also in 659, a vassal of Western Turkic Khaganate (Pin. Tujue), Duman (), the commander of the Esegels (aka Izgil, , Ch. Asijie, Sijie ÊÄùÁµê) Tribe, rebelled against Tang occupation, along with the Western Turkic Khaganate's subject kingdoms Shule (), Zhujupo (), and Yebantuo () (all in modern Kashgar, Xinjiang). The joint forces commanded by Duman quickly defeated the Tang vassal Yutian (‰∫éÁî∞, in modern Hotan, Xinjiang). In winter 659, Emperor Gaozong sent Su Dingfang against Duman, and once he arrived in the vicinity of Duman's army, he selected 10,000 infantry soldiers and 3,000 cavalry soldiers and made a surprise attack on Duman. When he arrived at Duman's headquarters, Duman was surprised, and after Su initially defeated Duman, Duman was forced to withdraw within the city. Su put the city under siege, and Duman surrendered. In spring 660, Su took Duman back to the eastern capital Luoyang, where Emperor Gaozong was at the time, to present Duman to him. Some officials requested that Duman be executed, but Su made a plea on Duman's behalf‚Äîthat he had promised Duman life before Duman surrendered‚Äîand Emperor Gaozong stated that while under the law, Duman should die, he would honor Su's promise, and so he spared Duman. On the other end of the Tang atmosphere of influence, on the Korean Peninsula, Baekje had been attacking the Tang ally Silla. Once Su returned from the Esegel campaign, Emperor Gaozong commissioned him to head over the sea to attack Baekje, in conjunction with Silla. Su quickly captured the Baekje capital Sabi, forcing Baekje's King Uija and his crown prince Buyeo Yung to surrender. Emperor Gaozong ordered that Baekje be annexed as Tang territory. Emperor Gaozong then followed up by commissioning Su, along with Qibi Heli, Liu Boying (), and Cheng Mingzhen (), to attack Goguryeo. In 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern-day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the opportunity to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast. Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms of painful headaches and loss of vision, generally thought to be hypertension-related,See, Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 40, p 683. and he began to have Empress Wu make rulings on petitions made by officials. It was said that Empress Wu had quick reactions and understood both literature and history, and therefore, she was making correct rulings. He also became very dependent on her advice over time. Thereafter, her authority rivaled Emperor Gaozong's, after this point on, Empress Wu became the undisputed power behind the throne for twenty-three years. =Middle reign: Empress Wu aggrandization of power= Longshuo and Linde eras (661‚Äì666) Meanwhile, just after Su Dingfang left Baekje territory to attack Goguryeo, the Buddhist monk Dochim () and the former Baekje general Gwisil Boksin rose to try to revive Baekje. They welcomed the Baekje prince Buyeo Pung back from Japan to serve as king, with Juryu (Ï£ºÎ•ò, Âë®Áïô, now Seocheon County, South Chungcheong) as their headquarters. They put the Tang general Liu Renyuan () under siege in Sabi. Emperor Gaozong sent the general Liu Rengui, who had previously been demoted to commoner rank for offending Li Yifu, with a relief force, and Liu Rengui and Liu Renyuan were able to fight off the Baekje resistance forces' attacks, but were themselves not strong enough to quell the rebellion, and so for some time the armies were in stalemate. Meanwhile, Su advanced on the Goguryeo capital Pyongyang and put it under siege, but was unable to capture it quickly. In spring 662, after the general Pang Xiaotai () was defeated by Goguryeo forces at Sasu River (ËõáÊ∞¥, probably Botong River) and was killed along with his 13 sons, Su ran into harsh snowstorms and withdrew. Around the same time, after the death of the Huige chief Yaoluoge Porun (), who had been obedient to Tang, Yaoluoge Porun's nephew Yaoluoge Bisudu () rose in rebellion with the Tongluo () and Pugu () tribes in conjunction with other Tiele Confederation tribes. Emperor Gaozong sent the general Zheng Rentai () to attack the Tiele, but while Zheng was initially victorious, his officers became bogged down in pillaging and eventually suffered great losses after being caught in poor weather. Emperor Gaozong instead sent Qibi, who was ethnically Tiele, assisted by Jiang Ke, to Tiele to try to persuade them to surrender. Qibi was able to do so, and rebel leaders were arrested and turned over to Tang. Qibi executed them and ended the rebellion. Meanwhile, for reasons unknown, also in 662 Emperor Gaozong sent the general Su Haizheng () to attack Qiuzi and ordered Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen to assist him. Ashina Buzhen, who had a rivalry with Ashina Mishe, falsely informed Su that Ashina Mishe was set to rebel and would attack the Tang army, and Su responded by ambushing Ashina Mishe, killing him and his chief assistants. The Western Turkic Khaganate tribes, angry over Ashina Mishe's death, largely turned away from Tang and submitted to the Tibetan Empire instead, and when Ashina Buzhen died later that year, Tang influence in the region was greatly reduced. During these years, Li Yifu had been, due to favors from Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu, exceedingly powerful, and he grew particularly corrupt. In 663, after reports of Li Yifu's corruption were made to Emperor Gaozong, Emperor Gaozong had Liu Xiangdao and Li Ji investigate, finding Li Yifu guilty. Li Yifu was removed from his post and exiled, and would never return to Chang'an. During the years, Empress Wu had repeatedly, in her dreams, seen Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, in the states they were after their terrible deaths, and she came to believe that their spirits were after her. For that reason, Emperor Gaozong started remodeling a secondary palace, Daming Palace (), into Penglai Palace (), and when Penglai Palace's main hall, Hanyuan Hall (), was completed in 663, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu moved to the newly remodeled palace (which was itself later renamed to Hanyuan Palace). (However, Empress Wang and Consort Xiao continued to appear in her dreams even after this, and therefore, late in Emperor Gaozong's reign, he and Empress Wu were often at the eastern capital Luoyang, not at Chang'an.) Also in 663, the Tibetan Empire attacked a Tang vassal state, the Tuyuhun. Tuyuhun's Ledou Khan Murong Nuohebo, unable to withstand the Tibetan attack, took his people and fled into Tang territory to seek protection, thus ending Tuyuhun's existence as a state. Meanwhile, also in 663, Liu Rengui and Liu Renyuan, in conjunction with Munmu of Silla and the former Baekje crown prince Buyeo Yung, defeated Buyeo Pung and Japanese forces sent to assist him, at the Battle of Baekgang. Buyeo Pung fled to Goguryeo, ending the Baekje resistance movement. Emperor Gaozong recalled Liu Renyuan, leading Liu Rengui in charge of former Baekje territory, but in 664 sent Liu Renyuan back to Baekje and tried to recall Liu Rengui. Liu Rengui petitioned to remain to prepare for another attack on Goguryeo, and Emperor Gaozong agreed to let him remain. By 664, Empress Wu, who felt that her power was well established, was extending her influence further in the political arena and increases her controlling behavior over Emperor Gaozong and arbitrarily makes many government decisions, in the same year when the eunuch Wang Fusheng () reported to Emperor Gaozong that she had engaged the sorcerer Guo Xingzhen () ‚Äì an act that was strictly forbidden‚ÄîEmperor Gaozong, in anger, summoned the chancellor Shangguan Yi to consult Shangguan. Shangguan suggested that he depose Empress Wu. He agreed, and had Shangguan draft an edict to that effect. However, Empress Wu had received information that that was happening, and she emerged to defend herself. Emperor Gaozong could not carry out the removal, and instead blamed Shangguan. As both Shangguan and Wang had previously served the former crown prince Li Zhong, Empress Wu had Xu Jingzong falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of conspiring against Emperor Gaozong's life. Around the new year 665, Shangguan and Wang were executed, and Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide. From this point on, every day that Emperor Gaozong presided over imperial meetings, Empress Wu would sit behind a pearl screen behind him to hear the reports as well she Received official audience with the Emperor and consulted with the authorities, this image makes overt the idea of involvement in state affairs behind the scenes, and imperial powers primarily fell into her hands and Empress Wu ruled on all important matters of state and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell. She was given extraordinary powers and political rule without interference, even from the highest authority of the Emperor, she had the ultimate power, and she became a formidable figure with far-reaching influence. She and Emperor Gaozong were thereafter referred to as the \\"Two Saints.\\" In 665, Emperor Gaozong went to Luoyang and began preparation in earnest to make sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai ‚Äì a traditional ceremony for emperors that were rarely carried out in history due to the large expenses associated with them. At Empress Wu's request‚Äîas she reasoned that the sacrifice to earth also included sacrifices to past empresses (Emperor Gaozong's mother Empress Zhangsun and grandmother Duchess Dou, posthumously honored as an empress), she believed that it would be more appropriate to have females offer the sacrifices rather than male officials, as had been tradition in the past. Emperor Gaozong decreed that the male ministers would offer sacrifices first, but Empress Wu would next offer sacrifices, followed by Princess Dowager Yan, the mother of Emperor Gaozong's younger brother Li Zhen the Prince of Yue. In winter 665, Emperor Gaozong departed Luoyang and headed for Mount Tai. On the lunar new year (10 February 666ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ), he initiated the sacrifices to heaven, which were not completed until the next day. On 12 February, sacrifices were made to earth. He gave general promotions to the imperial officials, and it was said that starting from this time, promotions of imperial officials, which were strict and slow during the reigns of Emperors Gaozu and Taizong, began to become more relaxed and often excessive. He also declared a general pardon, except for long-term exiles. Japan, India, the Persian court in exile, Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, the Turks, Khotan, the Khmer, and the Umayyad Caliphate all had representatives attending the Feng and Shan sacrifices held by Emperor Gaozong in 666 at Mount Tai.Skaff 2012, pp. 146‚Äì147. Qianfeng and Zhongzhang eras (666‚Äì670) Estimated territorial extent of Emperor Gaozong's empire. In summer 666, Yeon Gaesomun died and was initially succeeded as Dae Mangniji by his oldest son Yeon Namsaeng. As Yeon Namsaeng subsequently carried out a tour of Goguryeo territory, however, rumors began to spread both that Yeon Namsaeng was going to kill his younger brothers Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan, whom he had left in charge at Pyongyang, and that Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan were planning to rebel against Yeon Namsaeng. When Yeon Namsaeng subsequently sent officials close to him back to Pyongyang to try to spy on the situation, Yeon Namgeon arrested them and declared himself Dae Mangniji, attacking his brother. Yeon Namsaeng sent his son (later known as Cheon Heonseong/Quan Xiancheng (), as Yeon Namsaeng changed his family name from Yeon () to observe naming taboo for Emperor Gaozu, whose personal name was the same character) to Tang to seek aid. Emperor Gaozong saw this as the opportunity to destroy Goguryeo, and he initially commissioned Qibi Heli to aid Yeon Namsaeng, and also sent the generals Pang Tongshan () and Gao Kan () to attack Goguryeo. Meanwhile, Empress Wu's sister, the Lady of Han (who had married the low-level official Helan Yueshi ()), and her daughter Lady Helan had both been frequently visiting the palace and were said to be \\"favored\\" by Emperor Gaozong. When Lady of Han died in 666, Emperor Gaozong created Lady Helan the Lady of Wei, and wanted to let her live in the palace, but hesitated because he thought Empress Wu would be jealous. When Empress Wu heard this, she was indeed jealous, and therefore she poisoned meat offered by her nephews Wu Weiliang () and Wu Huaiyun (), who had been on poor relations with her and whose grandmother were not her mother Lady Yang; she then gave the poisonous meat to Lady Helan, who ate it and died. Empress Wu then implicated Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun in Lady Helan's death and executed them. Around the new year 667, Emperor Gaozong further commissioned Li Ji to be the overall commander of the attack on Goguryeo, assisted by Hao Chujun. In fall 667, Li Ji crossed the Liao River and captured Sinseong (Êñ∞Âüé, in modern Fushun, Liaoning). The Tang forces thereafter fought off counterattacks by Yeon Namgeon and joined forces with Yeon Namsaeng, although they were initially unable to cross the Yalu River. In spring 668, Li Ji turned his attention to Goguryeo's northern cities, capturing the important city Buyeo (Êâ∂È§ò, in modern Siping, Jilin). In fall 668, he crossed the Yalu and put Pyongyang under siege. Yeon Namsan and King Bojang surrendered, and while Yeon Namgeon continued to resist in the inner city, his general, the Buddhist monk Shin Seong () turned against him and surrendered the inner city to Tang forces. Yeon Namgeon tried to commit suicide, but was seized and treated. This was the end of Goguryeo, and Tang annexed Goguryeo into its territory, with Xue Rengui being put initially in charge of former Goguryeo territory as protector general. However, there was much resistance to Tang rule (fanned by Silla, which was displeased that Tang did not give the Goguryeo territory to it), and in 669, following Emperor Gaozong's order, a part of the Goguryeo people were forced to move to the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River, as well as the regions south of the Qin Mountains and west of Chang'an, only leaving old and weak inhabitants in the original land. Xianheng era (670‚Äì674) In summer 670, the Tibetan Empire captured the 18 prefectures that Tang had established over the Western Regions (Xiyu), and Emperor Gaozong, in response, commissioned Xue Rengui, assisted by Ashina Daozhen () and Guo Daifeng (), to attack the Qinghai Lake area, to try to open a second front against the Tibetan Empire as well as to try to restore the territory previously held by Tuyuhun. However, Guo, who felt himself to be Xue's equal as a general, was displeased at serving as an assistant, and their discord eventually led to a major defeat at the hands of the Tibetan Empire's prime minister Lun Qinling (). For the time being, the Xiyu territory was lost. By 672, Emperor Gaozong gave up the hopes of reestablishing Tuyuhun and moved Murong Nuohebo and his people deep into Tang territory. By 674, Emperor Gaozong was displeased at King Munmu of Silla encouragement of Goguryeo revival movements who continued to resist Tang rule over the region and he stripped King Munmu of all Tang-bestowed titles, including the title of King of Silla, and arbitrarily conferred them on King Munmu's brother Kim Immun () instead, commissioning Liu Rengui, assisted by Li Bi (ÊùéÂºº, Li Ji's brother) and the ethnically Mohe general Li Jinxing (), to escort Kim Immun back to Silla territory. However, King Munmu formally apologized and offered tribute, Emperor Gaozong ordered a withdrawal and recalled Kim Immun. The Sassanian prince Peroz III fled to China during this time around 670. The Chinese Emperor, who allowed Sassanian refugees fleeing from the Arab conquest to settle in China. =Late reign: Problems of succession= Shangyuan and Yifeng eras (674‚Äì679) In 675, Li Jinxing reached Silla territory with Mohe forces that submitted to Tang. However, Tang forces were repelled by Silla army at Maeso fortress. The emperor over the years suffered much more severe headaches from consuming many of the dangerous substances that Empress Wu ordered. Because he could not run the empire, power in the imperial court gradually passed to Empress Wu. Meanwhile, by this time, even more Emperor Gaozong was continuously suffering from a persistent headache, and he considered making Empress Wu regent, to gain all power without his control. Both Hao Chujun and Li Yiyan objected strenuously, and Emperor Gaozong did not make her regent and she continued as an unofficial regent. (The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang suggested that Emperor Gaozong's illnesses may be the result of long-term poisoning by Empress Wu,Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 48. but did not provide evidence.) However, this did not prevent Empress Wu from engaging a number of mid-level officials, including Yuan Wanqing () and Liu Yizhi, known as the \\"North Gate Scholars\\" (ÂåóÈñÄÂ≠∏Â£´, as the palace sat north of the imperial government) to serve as her advisors and to divert the powers of the chancellors in government affairs. she did something about it as well so as not to disturb her enduring authority in governing the government and its decisions. Also in 675, Li Hong the Crown Prince died suddenly‚Äîwith traditional historians largely attributing his death to poisoning by Empress Wu, due to her anger that he tried to curb her power grab and had shown sympathy to his two older sisters born of Consort Xiao‚ÄîPrincesses Yiyang and Gao'an. Emperor Gaozong, in grief, posthumously honored Li Hong as an emperor, and he created Empress Wu's second son, Li Xian the Prince of Yong, crown prince. Along with the war with Silla, some resistance of Goguryeo people continued to plague Tang rule there. In 676, Xue Rengui crossed the Yellow Sea to fight against Silla. However, Silla navy expelled Tang forces on the coast of western Silla. Emperor Gaozong order withdrawal of Tang forces from the Korean Peninsula entirely and moved the Protectorate General to Pacify the East to Liaodong (ÈÅºÊù±, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning) and the commandant of Xiongjin (), who governed the former Baekje territory at Sabi, to Geonan (Âª∫ÂÆâ, in modern Yingkou, Liaoning), allowing Silla eventually to expel Tang out of the Korean Peninsula and unified the parts of the peninsula south of the Taedong River. In 677, he bestowed on Goguryeo's former King Bojang, Go Jang, the titles of Prince of Chaoxian and commandant of Liaodong, giving him the forcibly removed Goguryeo people. He also bestowed on Buyeo Yung the title of Prince of Daifang and commandant of Xiongjin‚Äîwith the intent of letting Go Jang and Buyeo Yung to rebuild Goguryeo and Baekje as loyal vassals to counteract Silla. To accommodate these movements, the Protectorate General was further moved to Xincheng. (Buyeo Yung was not able to make any headway in leading his people back to Baekje territory, while Go Jang tried to break away from Tang rule in alliance with the Mohe; when this was discovered, Emperor Gaozong recalled him to Chang'an and exiled him to Qiong Prefecture.) Meanwhile, Tang had to endure multiple attacks from the Tibetan Empire, and in 677, he commissioned Liu Rengui, then a chancellor, to take up defense position at Taohe Base (Ê¥ÆÊ≤≥Ëªç, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), to prepare a counterattack against the Tibetan Empire. However, Liu's proposals were repeatedly blocked by another chancellor, Li Jingxuan. In order to retaliate against Li Jingxuan, even though Liu knew that Li Jingxuan was not capable in military matters, he nevertheless recommended that Li Jingxuan take over for himself, and despite Li Jingxuan's attempt to decline, Emperor Gaozong commissioned Li Jingxuan to command the army against the Tibetan Empire. In fall 678, Li Jingxuan's forces engaged Tibetan forces commanded by Lun Qinling, and was soundly defeated, with Li Jingxuan's assistant Liu Shenli () captured by the Tibetan Empire. Li Jingxuan was only able to escape after being protected by the ethnically Baekje general Heichi Changzhi. Tiaolu, Yonglong, Kaiyao, Yongchun, and Hongdao eras (679‚Äì683) Meanwhile, the Western Turkic Khaganate chieftain Ashina Duzhi had claimed the title of Shixing Khan and was allied with another chieftain, Li Zhefu (), and they pillaged Anxi (i.e., Suyab). Emperor Gaozong was ready to commission an army against Ashina Duzhi and Li Zhefu, but the official Pei Xingjian (), who had previously served as secretary general at Xi Prefecture (Ë•øÂ∑û, roughly modern Turfan Prefecture, Xinjiang), opposed‚Äîinstead proposing that a small detachment be announced to escort the Persian prince Narsieh back to Persia to contend for regal title. Emperor Gaozong agreed and put Pei in charge of the detachment. When Pei arrived at Xi Prefecture, he, under the guise of a hunting party, summoned a number of tribal chiefs loyal to Tang in the area, and once they arrived, launched a surprise attack on Ashina Duzhi, who, caught by surprise, was forced to surrender; Li Zhefu then surrendered as well. (Narsieh, having been used in this manner, was left in the region to fend for himself.) Meanwhile, though, another trouble was flaring up for Tang. The former G√∂kt√ºrk territory, over which Tang had established 24 prefectures with the tribal chiefs serving as prefects, rebelled, and, under the leadership of Ashide Wenfu () and Ashide Fengzhi (), supported Ashina Nishoufu as khan. Emperor Gaozong sent Xiao Siye to attack Ashina Nishoufu, but after Xiao achieved a few victories, he became careless, and a counterattack by Ashina Nishoufu crushed him, advancing as far as Ding Prefecture. Ashina Nishoufu also encouraged the Xi and the Khitan to attack Ying Prefecture (ÁáüÂ∑û, roughly modern Zhaoyang, Liaoning), although those attacks were fought off. Around the new year 680, after Pei returned from the Western Turkic Khaganate front, Emperor Gaozong commissioned him to attack the G√∂kt√ºrks. Pei defeated and captured Ashide Fengzhi, and Ashina Nishoufu's subordinates killed him and surrendered, ending the rebellion. Meanwhile, Li Xian's relationship with Empress Wu was deteriorating, as Li Xian heard rumors that he was not born of Empress Wu but her sister Lady of Han, and was fearful. Meanwhile, earlier, Ming Chongyan (), a sorcerer trusted by Empress Wu and Emperor Gaozong, had repeatedly stated that he believed Li Xian did not have the abilities to be emperor, that his younger brother Li Zhe the Prince of Ying had an appearance like Emperor Taizong, and that another younger brother, Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, had the most honored appearance of all. Knowing that Li Xian was fearful of her, Empress Wu had the North Gate Scholars author teachings on filial piety to give to Li Xian, and also personally rebuked him, further causing him to be alarmed. When Ming was assassinated in 679, Empress Wu suspected Li Xian of carrying out the assassination. She had a report made to Emperor Gaozong that accused Li Xian of assassinating Ming. When the officials Xue Yuanchao, Pei Yan, and Gao Zhizhou were put in charge of investigations, they discovered a number of armors in Li Xian's palace. Empress Wu thus accused Li Xian of treason, and while Emperor Gaozong initially wanted to take no actions against Li Xian, at Empress Wu's insistence he relented. In fall 680, he reduced Li Xian to commoner rank, and created Li Zhe as the new crown prince. In 681, the G√∂kt√ºrk territory flared up again, as the chieftain Ashina Fu'nian claimed khan title and allied with Ashide Wenfu to attack Chinese territory. Emperor Gaozong again commissioned Pei to attack G√∂kt√ºrk forces. Pei's assistant Cao Huaishun () was initially defeated by Ashina Fu'nian, but after Pei sent spies to spread rumors, the rumors led to discord between Ashina Fu'nian and Ashide Wenfu. When Pei's forces approached Ashina Fu'nian's position, Ashina Fu'nian arrested Ashide Wenfu and surrendered. (Against Pei's recommendation to spare Ashina Fu'nian, Emperor Gaozong executed him.) In 682, the Western Turkic Khaganate chieftain Ashina Chebo () rebelled against Tang rule, and Emperor Gaozong initially was to commission Pei again, but before the army could depart, Pei died. However, the commandant at Anxi, Wang Fangyi (ÁéãÊñπÁøº, Empress Wang's cousin) was able to defeat Ashina Chebo and crush the rebellion. Also in 682, the G√∂kt√ºrk chief Ashina Gudulu rose, in alliance with Ashide Yuanzhen (), to claim khan title. This, unlike the several earlier rebellions, actually saw the G√∂kt√ºrk khanate being permanently reestablished to Tang's north and persisting for decades, and would plague the last two years of Emperor Gaozong's reign as well as the reigns of his successors. Late in 683, Emperor Gaozong was seriously ill, and he, who was then at Luoyang, summoned Li Zhe, then in charge of Chang'an, to Luoyang to attend to him. On 27 December 683, he died. Li Zhe succeeded him (as Emperor Zhongzong), but all actual power still would be in the still hands of Empress Wu, who became empress dowager.

The film was produced by Julio Fern√°ndez and Brian Yuzna. The film's plot follows an American family who move into a house in the Spanish countryside, where six children disappeared during an occult ritual forty years before; the teenage daughter and young son of the family are subjected to increasing disturbances in the house. The film premiered in Spain on October 3, 2002, and was released in theaters across the country eight days later on October 11. It was sold to Miramax Films for American distribution in 2003, but ended up being put on hiatus for over a year; it was eventually released in United States theaters in an edited, PG-13-rated cut on December 25, 2004. Plot Forty years after an unfinished occult ritual resulted in the disappearance of six young children, the Rua family has moved from the United States into a new, never-before inhabited house in Spain. The mother, Maria, wants to get the place in order, while the father, Mark, goes to work, and their children, teenager Regina and her younger brother Paul, try to settle into their daily routines. It helps that Mark's doctor-father, Albert Rua has furnished them with their residence and is nearby, especially when Mark begins to suffer from seizures again due to the progression of his Huntington's disease, which also causes him to become increasingly mentally unstable. Regina is not only worried about him, but also Paul who is now scared of the dark for the first time. The young boy has reason for that, however, as there seems to be some sort of supernatural entity beneath his bed. Furthermore, there are instances when six ghostly figures of children are seen standing in the shadows and darkness, watching the family. As Paul becomes more scared and their father continues to mentally deteriorate, Regina eventually figures out it must have something to do with their home where the power is lost every day. With the help of her new friend, Carlos, the two eventually meet the man, Villalobos, who designed the house, and learn that it was built for a supernatural ritual requiring the sacrifice of seven children (each sacrificed by \\"hands that love them\\") to coincide with an eclipse that only occurs every forty years. With the next one quickly approaching, and now armed with the knowledge that the earlier occult ritual needs one more death to be completed, Regina races to make sure that Paul is not the final victim. Stopping first at her grandfather Albert's house to warn him as well, Regina finds out that her grandfather is, in fact, a member of the cult which has been performing these satanic rituals. Her grandfather explains that in the ritual forty years ago, there actually were seven children in the original ritual, the seventh child being none other than Regina's father, Mark. Albert did not sacrifice his son because at the last minute he realized that he did not love Mark. Waiting 40 years, he has brought Mark and his family to the house with the intention of completing the ritual during this eclipse. Regina also discovers the target is not Paul but still Mark, who is to be sacrificed by \\"hands that love him.\\" As Regina laments, Albert realizes her true love for her father. He suddenly frees her to return to the house, aware that she will be able to unknowingly carry out the ritual. Regina races back to her home to find her father in the midst of another attack, choking on pills as the eclipse begins. Maria tries to perform a tracheotomy on him, but is unable to bring herself to make the cut. In a panic, Regina does instead, but Mark bleeds out and dies when the supernatural forces within the house hide the pen tube needed to complete the procedure. Since Regina genuinely loved Mark, the ritual is finally complete. The darkness then takes the form of Regina and Paul, convincing their mother to turn off the lights. The darkness kills Maria, and then takes the form of Regina's friend Carlos, who picks them up in his car; shortly after they leave, the real Carlos arrives at the house, and is called inside by the darkness, manifesting as Regina's voice. Carlos' doppelg√§nger drives Regina and Paul into a dark tunnel, implying to their doom.

Release The film premiered in Spain on 3 October 2002, and was then given a wide release there on 11 October. It was released in a number of European countries throughout 2003, and was then sold to Miramax Films, but was shelved for nearly two years. It was eventually theatrically released on 25 December 2004 in the US, via Miramax's Dimension Films branch, in a heavily censored Miramax-mandated PG-13 version. It was given an even later release in the United Kingdom, in March 2005. Despite many negative reviews and very little promotion, Darkness still did moderately well at the United States box office. It was released Christmas Day 2004, which was a Saturday. It was the seventh highest earner that weekend with $6.1 million (at $3,625 average per theater), earning over half of its budget over two days. The following week, it dropped to tenth highest earner with $4.6 million. Darkness eventually earned $34.4 million worldwide, with a $10.6 million budget. Reception Darkness received extremely negative reviews from both critics and audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 4% based on 55 reviews. It received an average rating of \\"F\\" on CinemaScore, indicating overwhelming dislike; , it is one of only 19 films to receive such a rating. The Los Angeles Timess Kevin Thomas awarded the film one out of four stars, deeming it \\"trite and flat,\\" and \\"too mechanical to be persuasive or scary.\\" Ned Martel of The New York Times noted: \\"Darkness, which crept into theaters nationwide on Christmas Day, tries to spook holiday revelers with a guessing game about which member of a handsome American family, relocated to Spain, will kill another. But the real mystery is why such a mangled film was not junked altogether.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said the film is \\"a horror movie so vague about the nightmare it‚Äôs spinning, it seems scared of its own shadows... Darkness was clearly tossed together like salad in the editing room, since it‚Äôs little more than the sum of its unshocking shock cuts.\\" David Blaylock The Village Voice also gave the film a middling review, writing: \\"Moments hint at a metaphoric statement on child abuse, but the film proves mainly to be a commentary on poor electrical wiring.\\" Bilge Ebiri of The New York Sun similarly noted the film as containing elements of a \\"a disturbing family drama,\\" adding that it is \\"at its best when exploring Dad's bouts with his inner demons - but it's quickly stifled by tired attempts to jolt the audience and more narrative dead-ends. Variety praised the film's cinematography, but criticized its script: \\"Although director Balaguero displays a talent for spooky visuals and creating an atmosphere of quietly simmering tension, his screenplay (co-written by Fernando de Felipe) is a compendium of barely connected scenes that ultimately lapse into incoherence.\\" Professor Ann Davies wrote that Darkness shares similarities with the Edgar Allan Poe story The Fall of the House of Usher (1893). The breakdown of family relationships (especially the father's ancestry) are reflected in the \\"increasing evidence of evil\\" within the house. Davies also sees the film's representation of a haunted house as \\"part of a wider Gothic mode\\" both in Spanish cinema and beyond, which \\"tap into memories and reflections of traumas that are unconfined by national boundaries.\\" See also * List of films featuring eclipses References Sources * External links * Official US site 2002 horror films Spanish films American films English-language films American haunted house films Films set in Spain American supernatural horror films Films directed by Jaume Balaguer√≥ Spanish horror films 2002 films Dimension Films films Films shot in Spain Films written by Jaume Balaguer√≥ Filmax International ","title":"Darkness (2002 film)"},{"id":"1373224","text":"La Brassiere () is a 2001 Hong Kong romantic comedy film starring Lau Ching- wan, Louis Koo, Carina Lau and Gigi Leung. The film was followed by a sequel, titled Mighty Baby, which was released in 2002. Plot The film's underlying plot is to create the \\"ultimate brassiere\\" for a Japanese company specialising in this undergarment, hence the fanciful title. Samantha (Carina Lau), who is managing the Hong Kong subsidiary of the company, is the project leader of this assignment and she appoints two zany but highly creative designers to aid her in that project, Wayne (Louis Koo) and Johnny (Lau Ching-wan). Johnny flirts with Samantha soon enough, being engaged in such a work, which he claims would assist in his creative powers although the story was more engaged in the humorous efforts in creating the bra. However, Samantha snubbed his overtures and their love affair remained in balance. Meanwhile, during the project various prototypes were tried and tested, but with appalling results. Apparently, Wayne and Johnny being both male were unable to realise the finer points of creating the undergarment. Lena (Gigi Leung), a lover of Wayne and also working on the project then got the inspiration that the \\"ultimate bra\\" is the one which incorporates the feeling a woman has when her male lover lovingly supports her breasts. Accordingly, the two designers created just such an undergarment and was approved by their Japanese employers.

It premiered in Canada in 2002, and in Australia on The Comedy Channel in 2004. It has also been broadcast in India, South Korea and Germany. The series was on the digital network Hulu and is currently on CON TV in the United States. PWK began as a one-man live theatre show written and performed by comedian/puppeteer John Pattison at the Toronto Fringe Festival. It later morphed into the series, using the same dark topics and featuring some of the same puppet characters. In Puppets Who Kill, Rocko the Dog, Cuddles the Comfort Doll, Buttons the Bear, and Bill the Ventriloquist's Dummy are four puppets with anthropomorphic qualities including individual histories of delinquency and recidivism. Canadian courts sent each of them to a halfway house for puppets, operated by a hapless and somewhat incompetent social worker named Dan Barlow, played by Dan Redican. Characters =Rocko the Dog= Rocko (puppeteer Bruce Hunter), is a foul-mouthed, chain-smoking misanthrope who formerly worked on a children's television programme. The job required him to control his language and behaviour, but eventually a berserk outburst on set ended his career. He takes medication to temper his violent mood swings. =Cuddles the Comfort Doll= Cuddles (puppeteer Bob Martin) is a comfort doll designed to help people cope with their problems. However, as the introductory voice-over to each episode informs the viewer, it is Cuddles who is now the problem. The chronic subordination of his own needs to those of others caused him to explode one day, grab a rifle, and start shooting. Despite this eruption, Cuddles is generally the best behaved of the group, although his naivete often gets him and his fellow residents at the halfway house into trouble. He cannot handle pressure well, lacks self-assertiveness, and shows signs of a passive-aggressive personality disorder. =Buttons the Bear= Buttons (puppeteer James Rankin) is a teddy bear with eyes consisting of two buttons. Unlike the others, Buttons is not so much a killer as a lover. In fact, he is a womanizer with no sense of sexual propriety who is remarkably successful in attracting eager human females. Buttons lives by the hedonistic motto \\"if it feels good, do it\\". He once had a lucrative corporate sponsorship deal with the Happy Elf Peanut Butter Company, but the sponsor exercised the \\"moral turpitude\\" clause in his contract once details of his promiscuous behaviour leaked to the press. =Bill the ventriloquist Dummy= Bill (puppeteer Gord Robertson) is a ventriloquist's dummy with a menacing smile and psychopathic tendencies. Fifty-eight of his partners have died in \\"accidents\\". Bill's nemesis is the Rasputin-like Curious Bob (John Hemphill), a former partner whom Bill has unsuccessfully attempted to murder on four occasions. In an episode featuring Bill's trial, his adoptive mother relates facts about his past that indicate the possible sources of his homicidal vengefulness; for example, that Bill had some bowel problems as a child and would defecate in his pants, thus earning him the nickname \\"poopy pants\\" from his peers. Bill also has a small penis and oddly shaped gonads which his maker gave him in order to encourage humility but which instead produced only more humiliation for Bill, perhaps explaining his gruesome hobby of collecting the testicles of men who have somehow been mysteriously deprived of them. Bill was at some point castrated himself, and is now a eunuch. =Dan Barlow= Dan Barlow is a social worker who runs the halfway house where the puppets live but who shows himself ill-suited to his particular vocation. He has difficulty with his own moral compass, finds himself easily swept up in events, and often makes poor decisions. Although he genuinely cares about his charges, Dan's primary concern is keeping the halfway house open thus preserving his job. Production The series was shot both in the studio and on location in and around Toronto. It showcases Canadian talent, using several guest actors per episode, many of them well known in Canada, playing an array of idiosyncratic characters. Newsreader Bill Cameron regularly appeared as himself, often foreshadowing the show's plot by reporting on bizarre crimes that could only have been committed by Dan's charges. Among the many actors who have appeared in the series are Gordon Pinsent, Kristin Lehman, Emily Hampshire, Peter Outerbridge, Anna Silk and Helene Joy. Most of the Puppets Who Kill episodes were written by founding creator/producer John Pattison, with Dan Redican also writing a number of episodes and providing story editing advice. More than half of the series episodes were directed by producer Shawn Alex Thompson. The series employed experienced people recruited from the film industry in some of the technical positions. The contributions of sound designer Daniel Pellerin, editor Caroline Christie, and composer Carlos Lopes, among others, enhanced the look and sound of the series. On June 22, 2006, the show completed its fourth and final season. The first and second seasons have been released on DVD in full. Season 3 and 4 appeared in a 'Best of' collection in 2010 with audio commentaries by key cast and crew, and contains some of the show's greatest hits including such popular episodes as \\"The Joyride\\" and \\"The Rival House\\". Awards Puppets Who Kill won many awards in its four-year run. In Canada, it won 3 Gemini Awards, including Best Writing in a Comedy for founding creator/writer/producer John Pattison and Best Directing in a Comedy for producer/director Shawn Alex Thompson. PWK went on to receive a total of 15 Gemini nominations in various categories, from writing, directing, and acting to sound design and photography. The series also won the prestigious Bronze Rose for Comedy at the Montreux Television Festival in Switzerland in 2003, coming in second to The Office. Legacy As confirmed by the PWK website, a Puppets Who Kill movie is in the works. Dan Redican (known as Dan Barlow on the show) has toured Canada with the comedy troupe The Frantics. John Pattison has occasionally performed his live puppet show Beyond Puppets Who Kill in various cities in Canada.

Hans A. Einstein was a long-time professor of Hydraulic Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Einstein was widely recognized for his research on sediment transport. To honor his outstanding achievement in hydraulic engineering, the American Society of Civil Engineers established the \\"Hans Albert Einstein Award\\" in 1988 and the annual award is given to those who have made significant contributions to the field. Early life Hans Albert Einstein was born on May 14, 1904 in Bern, Switzerland, where his father, Albert Einstein, worked as a clerk in the patent office. His father was of German-Jewish descent and his mother, Mileva Mariƒá, Serbian- Orthodox. His younger brother, Eduard Einstein, was born in 1910 and died in 1965. The fate of his older sister, Lieserl Einstein, Albert Einstein's and Mileva Mariƒá's first child, is unknown. Their parents divorced in 1919 after living apart for five years. Career Einstein followed his mother's and father's footsteps and studied at ETH, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1926 he was awarded a diploma in civil engineering. From 1926 to 1930 he worked as a steel designer on a bridge project in Dortmund. In 1936 Hans Albert obtained the doctor of technical science degree. His doctoral thesis \\"Bed Load Transport as a Probability Problem\\" is considered the definitive work on sediment transport. Accessed August 31, 2016. Einstein's father, Albert, left Germany in 1933 to escape the virulently antisemitic Nazi threat. Heeding his father's advice, Einstein emigrated from Switzerland to Greenville, South Carolina, in 1938. He worked for the US Department of Agriculture, studying sediment transport from 1938 to 1943. He continued working for the USDA at the California Institute of Technology starting in 1943. In 1947 he took a position as associate professor of hydraulic engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. He advanced to full professor, and later professor emeritus. Einstein traveled the world to participate in hydraulic engineering conferences. He was at a symposium at Woods Hole in Massachusetts when he collapsed and died from heart failure on July 26, 1973. Einstein was honored by a Guggenheim Fellowship (1953), research awards from the American Society of Civil Engineers (1959 and 1960), the Berkeley Citation from the University of California (1971), the Certificate of Merit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1971), and a certificate of recognition for more than 20 years of devoted and distinguished service to Applied Mechanics Reviews by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1972). His papers are held at the Water Resources Collections and Archives in the University of California, Riverside LibrariesInventory of the Hans Albert Einstein Papers, 1937‚Äì1972 Online Archive of California and in the University of Iowa Libraries Special Collections and Archives. Personal life In 1927 Hans Albert Einstein married Frieda Knecht. Albert disapproved of Frieda much as his parents had of Mileva. Einstein and Frieda had four children: *Bernhard Caesar Einstein (10 July 1930 ‚Äì 30 September 2008), who was a physicist and engineer. *Klaus Martin Einstein (1932‚Äì1939), died of diphtheria aged six. *David Einstein (October‚ÄìNovember 1939),einstein- website.de died aged one month. *Evelyn Einstein (28 March 1941 ‚Äì 13 April 2011), adopted.

Einstein was an avid sailor, frequently taking colleagues and family out for excursions on the San Francisco Bay. On his many field trips and academic excursions, he took thousands of pictures, many of which he developed himself and presented as slide shows. He also loved music, as denoted on his gravestone, and he played flute and piano. Death Gravestone of Hans Albert Einstein in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, US, at the Woods Hole Village Cemetery.

He is currently a baseball analyst who co-hosts on Sirius XM Radio and appears on MLB Network. Early years Floyd with the Mets Floyd was born to parents Cornelius Clifford Floyd, Sr. and Olivia Floyd. After spending 13 years as an only child, Floyd was joined by brother Julius. Sister Shanta was later adopted when the Floyds noticed her as a six-year-old classmate of Julius' who had been troublesome for her then adoptive parents. The three siblings were raised in Markham, Illinois, a small suburb south west of Chicago. Floyd's father, a former Marine, worked double shifts at a U.S. Steel plant in Chicago to allow the family to live in a safe and stable neighborhood. At Thornwood High School in South Holland, Illinois, Floyd was a three-sport star in baseball, football, and basketball. In basketball, he led his high school to the Class AA Sectional Playoffs. He hit .508 with 130 RBI during the final two years of his high school career and led his team to the Illinois Class AA state baseball championship as a senior. He was heavily recruited by Arizona State University, Stanford, and Creighton University and signed a letter of intent to play for head coach Jim Hendry at Creighton. However, when the Montreal Expos drafted him as the 14th pick in the 1st round of the 1991 Major League Baseball draft, Floyd chose to go to the minor leagues. Major league career Floyd talking to hitting coach Jim Lefebvre for the San Diego Padres on March 5, =Montreal Expos= Prior to being called up by the Expos, Floyd was named the Sporting News' Minor League Player of the Year in 1993 after successful stints with the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League and Triple-A Ottawa Lynx. He made his major league debut that same year at only 21 years old, playing in 10 games with the Expos. On June 27, 1994, Floyd hit a home run off Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg Maddux at Olympic Stadium on a pitch that was low, by golfing the ball out in what would become a signature moment in the Expos dominant but strike- shortened 1994 season. Although Floyd never showed the power that was to come in later years during his first tenure with the Expos, he has expressed fondness for his time in Montreal, crediting his initial experience there for helping him grow both professionally and as a person. =Florida Marlins= In , Floyd was traded from the Expos to the Florida Marlins for Dustin Hermanson and Joe Orsulak. He won his lone World Series with the franchise in 1997. In , Floyd earned a starting position in the Marlins' outfield. In , in 420 at- bats, he hit .300 with 22 home runs and 91 RBI, including two walk-off home runs. In 2001, Floyd hit a career-high .317 with 31 home runs and drove in 103 runs in 149 games and was selected to play in his first and only all-star game. =Second Stint with Expos= In , Floyd was traded from the Marlins back to the Expos, with Claudio Vargas, Wilton Guerrero, and cash, for Graeme Lloyd, Mike Mordecai, Carl Pavano, Justin Wayne, and Donald Levinski. His second stint with the Expos was short-lived; he appeared in only 15 games before being traded. =Boston Red Sox= On July 30, 2002, Floyd was traded from the Expos to the Boston Red Sox for Sun-woo Kim and Song Seung-jun. Theories swirled around baseball as to the move (along with several others done by the Expos that year), with critics suggesting the MLB-owned Expos had traded Floyd in order to help the Red Sox. Floyd hit .317 in 47 games for the Red Sox. =New York Mets= In , Floyd was signed by the New York Mets. He played well for the Mets, but was hampered by injuries in 2003 and . However, Floyd stayed healthy in and responded with a career-high and team-leading 34 home runs. The next year, though, Floyd was once again limited by injuries and only played in 97 games during New York's division-winning year. He caught the division-clinching out for the Mets, but was slowed by injuries in the playoffs for New York, only recording twelve at-bats in his team's ten postseason games. =Chicago Cubs= In , Floyd agreed to a deal with his hometown Chicago Cubs for the 2007 season, with an option for . Floyd missed nine games in August 2007 to mourn the death of his father, Cornelius. He returned on August 21, 2007, to play the San Francisco Giants, where he drove in the winning runs in the top of the 9th. =Tampa Bay Rays= On December 14, 2007, Floyd signed a $3 million, one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. Floyd spent 2008 platooning for the Rays at DH against righties. =San Diego Padres= On February 5, , Floyd agreed to a one-year contract with the San Diego Padres. On October 8, 2009, the Padres released Floyd. =Career statistics= In 1621 games over 17 seasons, Floyd posted a .278 batting average (1479-for-5319) with 824 runs, 340 doubles, 23 triples, 233 home runs, 865 RBI, 148 stolen bases, 601 bases on balls, .358 on-base percentage and .482 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .980 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions and at first base. In 19 postseason games, he batted .216 (8-for-37) scoring 7 runs with 2 home runs and 4 RBI. Broadcasting career On February 22, 2010, Floyd accepted a broadcasting job with Fox Sports Florida. Floyd made his debut in the broadcasting booth for FOX Sports' Baseball Night in America on June 21, 2014. In 2015, Floyd joined SportsNet New York where he would be an analyst for New York Mets games. On March 8, 2015, Floyd broadcast his first Mets game, a spring training game against the Boston Red Sox on WPIX-TV, with Gary Cohen doing play-by-play. Floyd is currently a co-host on SiriusXM's MLB Network Radio and Fantasy Sports Radio. He is also a contributor to the MLB Network, occasionally appearing on its flagship studio show MLB Tonight. In 2018, Floyd joined Sportsnet to become a featured analyst for the network's Toronto Blue Jays coverage. Personal life Floyd lives in Florida with his longtime companion Maryanne Manning, the couple's two children, his mother, and the two children of his sister Shanta. Shanta died in 2006 after a long battle with cancer. He appeared on Season 9 and 10 of Dragons' Den.

Scholars dispute the authenticity of RDS-6 as a thermonuclear device as it did not manage to produce a yield consistent with a true hydrogen bomb. It utilized a scheme in which fission and fusion fuel (lithium-6 deuteride) were \\"layered\\", a design known as the Sloika (, named after a type of layered puff pastry) model in the Soviet Union. A ten-fold increase in explosive power was achieved by a combination of fusion energy and neutron- initiated (\\"boosted\\") fission. A similar design was earlier theorized by Edward Teller, but never tested in the U.S., as the \\"Alarm Clock\\".  Description  The Soviet Union started studies of advanced nuclear bombs and a hydrogen bomb, code named RDS-6, in June 1948. The studies would be done by KB-11 (usually referred to as Arzamas-16, the name of the town) and FIAN. The first hydrogen bomb design was the Truba (, pipe/cylinder) (RDS-6t)). In March 1948 Klaus Fuchs had provided the USSR with documents of the US 'Classical Super'. In these documents the classical super was described as consisting of a gun-type Uranium-235 primary with beryllium oxide tamper and a secondary consisting of a long cylinder with deuterium, doped with tritium near the primary. The design of the RDS-6t was similar to this classical super. The difference was that the light shell of beryllium oxide was replaced by a heavy shell. The assumption was that the deuterium tritium mixture could be easily heated and compressed and the shock would start the thermonuclear reaction prematurely. A heavy shell opaque to radiation would prevent this unwanted preheating more than the light shell. In September / October 1948 Andrei Sakharov, working in FIAN, came up with a competing idea of alternating layers of deuterium and Uranium-238 around a fissile core (Sakharov's 'first idea'). This second design was code named Sloika (RDS-6s) or 'Layer Cake' after the layering . In March 1949 Vitaly Ginzburg proposed to replace the deuterium by Lithium-6 deuteride ('second idea'). The proposal was based on the better efficiency due to the generation of tritium by the neutron capture of lithium and the Uranium-238 fission by the 14 MeV neutrons from D + T fusion. At that time Ginzburg did not know that the cross section for D + T reaction was much larger than that for D + D reaction. In April 1949 the group received D + T cross section data obtained from intelligence gathering without mentioning the source. The large advantage of lithium deuteride became evident and the deuterium design was abandoned. Both the 'first' and 'second' idea were used in the RDS-6s. The result was similar to the US 'Alarm Clock', but there is no indication that the Soviets were aware of the concept of the 'Alarm Clock'. After the United States tested Mike in November 1952, Beria sent a memo to spare no effort on the development of the RDS-6s. In the final development report from June 1953 the yield was estimated at 300 +/- 100 kilotons. The RDS-6s was tested on August 12, 1953 (Joe 4). The measured yield was 400 kilotons, 10% from fission of the Uranium-235 core, 15-20% from fusion and 70 - 75% from fission of the Uranium-238 layers. After the successful test Sakharov proposed a more powerful version of the RDS-6s, code named RDS-6sD. Attempts to increase the yield of the RDS-6s however proved unfeasible. In December 1953 all research on the RDS-6t was also stopped after it was proven that thermonuclear ignition was not possible in the RDS-6t. Both the RDS-6s and the RDS-6t were dead ends and research focused again on a two-stage thermonuclear weapon. A variant of the RDS-6s was developed later, code named RDS-27. The difference between the RDS-6s and the RDS-27 was that the RDS-27 did not use tritium. This improved the operational usefulness of the RDS-27, but reduced the yield from 400 kilotons to 250 kilotons. The RDS-27 was intended as a warhead for the R-7 ICBM. The RDS-27 was tested November 6, 1955 (Joe 18). Despite the inability of the RDS-6s to be scaled into the megaton range, the detonation was still used by Soviet diplomats as leverage. The Soviets claimed that they too had a hydrogen bomb, but unlike the United States' first thermonuclear weapon, theirs was deployable by air. The United States didn't develop a deployable version of the hydrogen bomb until 1954. The first Soviet test of a \\"true\\" hydrogen bomb was on November 22, 1955 under the directive of Nikolai Bulganin (influenced by Nikita Khrushchev), code- named RDS-37. All were at Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakh SSR. Like RDS-6, it was a \\"dry\\" weapon, using lithium-6 deuteride instead of liquid deuterium.

Located in Vestland county in Western Norway, it stretches inland from the ocean to the small village of Skjolden in the municipality of Luster. The fjord gives its name to the surrounding district of Sogn. The name is related to Norwegian word s√∫g- \\"to suck\\", presumably from the surge or suction of the tidal currents at the mouth of the fjord. Geography View of the fjord near Vangsnes The fjord runs through many municipalities: Solund, Gulen, Hyllestad, H√∏yanger, Vik, Sogndal, L√¶rdal, Aurland, √Ördal, and Luster. The fjord reaches a maximum depth of below sea level, and the greatest depths are found in the central parts of the fjord near H√∏yanger. Sognefjord is more than deep for about of its length, from Rutledal to Hermansverk. Near its mouth, the bottom rises abruptly to a sill about below sea level. The seabed in Sognefjord is covered by some thick sediments such that the bedrock is some below sea level. The fjord is up to wide. The average width of the main branch of the Sognefjord is less than . The depth increases gradually from √Ördal to a central basin reaching more than in depth located between Leikanger and Brekke. From Brekke the floor rises rapidly to Losna island, then drops gradually with a threshold at about in the Solund area. Thresholds occur in an area with sounds, valleys, and low land where the glacier was allowed spread out and lose its erosive effect. Cliffs surrounding the fjord rise almost sheer from the water to heights of and more. Around the outer area the land rises to about above the sea, while in the inner areas of the fjord, they reach about . The inner part has extensive tributary fjords such as Aurlandsfjorden, while the outer part is connected by narrow sounds to neighbouring fjords. Near the coast the fjord mouth is bounded largely by low islands and skerries that are part of the strandflat. The inner end of the Sognefjord is southeast of a mountain range rising to about above sea level and covered by the Jostedalsbreen, continental Europe's largest glacier. Thus the climate of the inner end of Sognefjorden and its branches are not as wet as on the outer coastline. Hurrungane range at the eastern end of the fjord reaches . The greatest elevation from sea bed to summit is at Sogndal. Several rivers pour fresh water into the fjord with an annual \\"spring\\" flood in June. The mouth of the fjord is surrounded by many islands including Sula, Losna, and Hiser√∏yna. The Sognefjord cuts through a northwestern gneiss area with a south-west to north-east structure, and penetrates the Caledonian fold through in the inner part. There is no clear relation between the east-west direction of the main fjord and the fold patterns of the bedrock, while some of tributary fjords in the parts corresponds to fold pattern. The volume of the whole Sognefjorden including its various branches is about , while the total volume of rock eroded by glaciers from the entire Sognefjord system and adjacent valleys is about . =Branches= There are many smaller fjords which branch off the main fjord. * Sognesj√∏en (mouth), * Lifjorden, * H√∏yangsfjord, * Arnafjord, * Esefjord, * Fj√¶rlandsfjord, * Sogndalsfjord, * Aurlandsfjord, * N√¶r√∏yfjord (a World Heritage Site), * L√¶rdalsfjord, * √Ördalsfjord, * Lustrafjord (innermost), = Lustrafjorden= The innermost arm of the Sognefjorden is called the Lustrafjord, in the municipality of Luster. At its end is the village of Skjolden, which is an access point to Jotunheimen National Park. In earlier times, transport between Bergen and the Scandinavian inland was by boat between Bergen and Skjolden and from there on a simple road over the highlands (today Norwegian County Road 55), or by boat to L√¶rdal and through the mountain pass to Valdres (now European route E16). Origin and geology The valley of Sognefjord is one of various valleys of western Norway that certainly predates the Quaternary glaciations. It existed already as part of the ancient Paleic surface but had at the time much gentler slopes. The fjords of western Norway formed in connection to the east-ward tilting of much of Norway during the Cenozoic uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains. This uplift, that occurred long before the Quaternary glaciations, enabled rivers to incise deeply the Paleic relief. An estimate of 7610 km3 of rock has been eroded from the Sognefjord drainage basin since the Paleic surface formed. The fluvial and glacial erosion that made the fjords has followed structural weaknesses in the crust. During the last glaciation the ice reached a maximum thickness of nearly 3000 meters in the Sognefjord area. Confluence of tributary fjords led excavation of the deepest fjord basin. Until about 30 km from the very coast the Sognefjord glacier was apparently constricted to its narrow channel of homogeneous gneiss, then the glacier suddenly spread out presumably through sounds and low valleys.Aarseth, I., Nesje, A., & Fredin, O.

Boats connect settlements along the fjord and its sidearms. Larger villages on the fjord and its branches include Leirvik, Ytre Oppedal, Vadheim, H√∏yanger, Vik√∏yri, Balestrand, Hermansverk, Sogndalsfj√∏ra, Gudvangen, Fl√•m, Aurlandsvangen, L√¶rdals√∏yri, √Ördalstangen, Gaupne and Solvorn. Gudvangen is situated by the N√¶r√∏yfjord, a branch of the Sognefjord particularly noted for its unspoiled nature and dramatic scenery, and only across at its narrowest point. Together with the Geirangerfjord in M√∏re og Romsdal, the N√¶r√∏yfjord is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. From the village of Fl√•m, the Fl√•m Railway climbs up to Myrdal Station in a distance of only --the steepest unassisted railway climb in the world. Around the inner end of the fjord, three of Norway's famous stave churches have survived: Kaupanger and Urnes (along the shoreline) and Borgund ( into the L√¶rdal valley). The Sognefjord Span (power lines) crosses the fjord with a span of . This is the second largest span of power lines in the world. The fjord has become a tourist attraction with summer tourists being an important part of the local economy. Transport There is a plan to build a road across the Sognefjord, crossing through a submerged tube in mid-water anchored to floats. This will avoid storms on the surface, and will not have to go over a kilometer deep to get below the bed of the fjord.https://www.businessinsider.com/norway-might-get-floating- underwater- tunnel-2016-7?r=US&IR;=Thttps://www.vegvesen.no/_attachment/274047/binary/485789 There are many ferry crossings of the Sognefjord.

Sinistar was created by Sam Dicker, Jack Haeger, Noah Falstein,Burnham (2003) p. 320 RJ Mical, Python Anghelo, and Richard Witt. In addition to the game's roaring antagonist, Sinistar is known for its high difficulty level. Gameplay The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and mines drifting planetoids and catching the crystals which are released. Shooting a planetoid too rapidly destroys it without releasing any crystals. Each collected crystal turns into a \\"Sinibomb\\", which is needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, but is constructed by enemy worker ships. Enemy worker ships collect crystals which they use to construct the Sinistar. Enemy warrior ships can directly attack the player's ship, shoot planetoids to mine crystals, and guard the Sinistar while it is being built. It takes 20 crystals to create the 20 pieces of a completely built Sinistar. Once the Sinistar is constructed, a digitized voice makes threatening pronouncements while chasing the player's ship: \\"Beware, I live!\\", \\"I hunger, coward!\\", \\"I am Sinistar!\\", \\"Run! Run! Run!\\", \\"Beware, coward!\\", \\"I hunger!\\", \\"Run, coward!\\", and a loud roar. The Sinistar has no weapons, but it destroys the player's ship on contact. A total of 13 Sinibombs are required to destroy Sinistar. Each Sinibomb automatically targets the Sinistar when fired, but can be intercepted by Workers, Warriors, and planetoids. The player warps to a new zone each time Sinistar is defeated. The unnamed first zone is followed by the Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone, then it cycles back to the Worker Zone. Each zone emphasizes a particular game feature, with the Void Zone having fewer planetoids. In all but the first zone, a completed but damaged Sinistar can be repaired by enemy Workers, extending its lifespan if the player is unable to kill it quickly. Development Sinistar was the first game to use stereo sound (in the sit- down version), with two independent front and back sound boards for this purpose. It was also used a 49-way optical joystick that Williams produced specifically for this game. The voice of Sinistar was recorded by radio personality John DoremusInternet Movie Database and played through an HC-55516 CVSD decoder Sinistar contains a bug that grants the player many lives (ships). It happens only if the player is down to one life and the Sinistar is about to eat the player's ship. If a warrior ship shoots and destroys the ship at this moment, it immediately takes the player to zero lives, and the Sinistar eating the player subtracts another life. Since the number of lives is stored in the game as an 8-bit unsigned integer, the subtraction from zero will cause the integer to wrap around to the largest value representable with 8 bits, which is 255 in decimal.Noah Falstein interview, Williams Arcade Classics CD-ROM for MSDOS and Microsoft Windows, Williams Entertainment, 1996 Legacy There were no contemporary ports of Sinistar. Versions for the Atari 2600 and the Atari 8-bit family were in progress, but not completed. Sinistar was commercially available in the mid-1990s as part of Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits for the Super NES, Sega Genesis and Saturn, Dreamcast, PlayStation, and Microsoft Windows. It is also available as part of Midway Arcade Treasures, which was released for the Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, and PlayStation 2 in 2003, and for Windows in 2004; part of Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable in late 2005; and part of Midway Arcade Origins for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

In Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos the Undead DreadLord hero says, \\"I Hunger!\\" In the game Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, the neutral hero Firelord's birth sound is him saying \\"Beware, I live.\\" World of Warcraft paid tribute to the same quote: The boss enemy Reliquary of Souls shouts it when freed. In Team Fortress 2, the Heavy class says the phrases \\"I Live!\\" and \\"Run, Cowards!\\" The phrase \\"Run coward! I live!\\" occasionally appears as splash text on Minecraft. In League of Legends, Dark Star Thresh may say \\"Beware, I live\\" upon respawning after a death, while Final Boss Veigar may say \\"I hunger!\\" while moving around the map. The original Escape Velocity game also had rare guest appearances of the Sinistar, including some of its catchphrases. Sinistar is also referred to in various non-video-game media. The Cage song \\"Grand Ol' Party Crash\\" samples Sinistar. The film We Are the Strange uses \\"Beware, I live\\", \\"I hunger\\", \\"Run, coward\\", and Sinistar's roar. Sinistar makes several appearances in the webcomic Bob the Angry Flower, and also appears as the title of one of the print editions of the comic. Sinistar appears in the DVD version of the South Park episode trilogy \\"Imaginationland\\". The sound bite \\"Beware, coward\\" was used in the theme tune to the British Channel 4 video- game TV show Bits. The audio version of podcast IGN Game Scoop uses the sound bite \\"Beware, I live\\" in its theme tune.

In mathematical graph theory, the rooted product of a graph G and a rooted graph H is defined as follows: take V(G) copies of H, and for every vertex v_i of G, identify v_i with the root node of the i-th copy of H. More formally, assuming that V(G) = {g1, ..., gn}, V(H) = {h1, ..., hm} and that the root node of H is h_1, define :G \\\\circ H := (V, E) where :V = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{(g_i, h_j): 1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n, 1\\\\leq j\\\\leq m\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and :E = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{((g_i, h_1), (g_k, h_1)): (g_i, g_k) \\\\in E(G)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\bigcup_{i=1}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{((g_i, h_j), (g_i, h_k)): (h_j, h_k) \\\\in E(H)\\\\right\\\\\\\\} If G is also rooted at g1, one can view the product itself as rooted, at (g1, h1). The rooted product is a subgraph of the cartesian product of the same two graphs. Applications The rooted product is especially relevant for trees, as the rooted product of two trees is another tree. For instance, Koh et al. (1980) used rooted products to find graceful numberings for a wide family of trees. If H is a two-vertex complete graph K2, then for any graph G, the rooted product of G and H has domination number exactly half of its number of vertices. Every connected graph in which the domination number is half the number of vertices arises in this way, with the exception of the four-vertex cycle graph. These graphs can be used to generate examples in which the bound of Vizing's conjecture, an unproven inequality between the domination number of the graphs in a different graph product, the cartesian product of graphs, is exactly met .

There are 12 rugby clubs from Mahurangi RFC, based in Warkworth, Rodney District, in the north through to Massey the southernmost area of the union. The NHRU provincial rugby team that was formed in 1985 by clubs that left the Auckland Rugby Union. It competes in the Mitre 10 Cup, the successor to New Zealand's former domestic competition, the National Provincial Championship (NPC). History North Harbour was formed in 1985 by clubs that broke away from the Auckland Rugby Union. The Hibiscus flower was chosen as the new union's logo in reference to part of the union's catchment area - the Hibiscus Coast. The first side chosen to represent the union was an under 20 side who played Felbridge, a touring side from Britain. Grant Ferguson had the honour of scoring the union's first points via a penalty, with his captain, Alan McCulloch scoring the union's first try. The union expanded in 1989 when the Omaha, Warkworth and Kaipara Flats clubs merged to become the Mahurangi club and switched from the North Auckland union. North Harbour has enjoyed a great deal of success on the rugby field having produced All Blacks and other New Zealand Representative players, and also winning the 3rd division title in their first year, then promotion to NPC Division 1, and making the finals of the NPC competition on several occasions during the 1990s, and hosted the 1994 final at a capacity-crowd Onewa Domain against Auckland. Wordmark logo Onewa Domain, Northcote was the former home base for North Harbour rugby. North Harbour players play in the Super Rugby competition as part of the Auckland Blues partnership with the neighbouring Northland and Auckland unions. With the development of the North Harbour Stadium at Albany in the late 1990s, this stadium became the home base of Harbour rugby. North Harbour play in the Mitre 10 Cup. In 2006 North Harbour were the first team to play the new Tasman Makos winning 33‚Äì27 in Blenheim. They would go on to win their next eight of ten games including an historical victory over Canterbury for the Ranfurly Shield. However they were beaten by Otago 21‚Äì56 in the quarter finals. 2007 was a year of disappointment for North Harbour. Waikato claimed the Ranfurly Shield with a crushing 52‚Äì7 over the holders North Harbour. The team would only win four of ten matches including two draws to miss the playoffs. North Harbour won only three matches in 2008 finishing 12th. 2009 was the same with North Harbour finishing 12th, however they defeated the champions Canterbury 22‚Äì19 in the opening round and beat Auckland 16‚Äì14 at Eden Park. In 2010 North Harbour beat Japan 23‚Äì19 to start their 25th Jubilee Celebrations. However the team managed only four wins to finish 11th. In 2011 the team finished 6th in the Championship, but nearly beat Southland 23‚Äì25 in a Ranfurly Challenge. 2012 and 2013 were disappointing years for North Harbour finishing last in the Championship with only one win to their seasons. 2014 was downfall for North Harbour, as they only won 3 games, against Manawatu (24-13), Canterbury (29-24) and Hawkes Bay (28-25) 2015 seemed the same for North Harbour, they won 3 games again, against Southland (26-25), Counties Manukau (28-20) and Northland (36-12) 2016 saw North Harbour get promoted up from the Championship division, beating Counties Manukau (20-17), Manawatu (29-25), Southland (35-14), Bay of Plenty (44-34), and Northland (44-28),They defeated Wellington in the semi final (40-37) and defeating Otago to be promoted to the 2017 Premiership (17-14) In 2017, North Harbour won a lot of their games, beating Otago (19-17), Southland (45-20), their greatest Battle of the Bridge win against Auckland (57-10), Counties Manukau (27-18), Northland (22-31), Hawke's Bay (33-30), Waikato (13-11), They made the semi finals but did not beat Canterbury (35-24 loss) 2018 saw North Harbour beat Northland (21-20), Waikato (28-29), Bay of Plenty (32-30), Hawke's Bay (34-51), Taranaki (26-55), Counties Manukau (36-26).  Ranfurly Shield  North Harbour's first ten challenges for the Ranfurly Shield were unsuccessful, notably in 1996 when they challenged for it three times in 6 weeks against Taranaki, Waikato and Auckland. North Harbour succeeded in their eleventh challenge for the shield on 24 September 2006 by beating the previous holders Canterbury 21‚Äì17 at Jade Stadium in Christchurch. Under the rules of the Shield challenge, they had to defend the Shield before the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup season against teams in New Zealand's second tier domestic competition, the semi-professional Heartland Championship. Accordingly, they scheduled defences against Thames Valley on 30 June 2007 and Horowhenua-Kapiti on 14 July. Harbour easily won their first defence 69‚Äì0 over Thames Valley, and followed it up two weeks later with a 99‚Äì6 victory over Horowhenua-Kapiti. After defeating Taranaki 19‚Äì13 in their first challenge in the Air New Zealand Cup, North Harbour lost the Ranfurly Shield to Waikato by a record margin of 52‚Äì7.  North Harbour in Super Rugby  North Harbour is one of three provinces included in the Blues franchise who play in the Super Rugby competition; their players are eligible to be picked by the Blues without relying on player drafting. At the beginning of Super Rugby, North Harbour was part of the Chiefs franchise as a combined team of Auckland and North Harbour was thought to be unfair by the NZRU; Auckland and North Harbour collectively had a large percentage of the All Blacks of the time. Later however, North Harbour along with Northland were 'swapped' for Counties Manukau and Thames Valley, thus joined the Blues.  Club and high-school rugby  The North Harbour Club Rugby season runs annually from March through to the beginning of August. The premier title is fought for among senior teams for the right to be crowned North Harbour Club Rugby Champions. The winner receives the ASB Cup.https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/sport/70573296/asb-cup-in-massey-hands- once-again There are also 16 secondary schools fielding close to 100 teams within the North Harbour Region.

The definitive text was signed in Karlshorst, Berlin, on the night of 8 May 1945 by representatives of the three armed services of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) and the Allied Expeditionary Force together with the Supreme High Command of the Soviet Red Army, with further French and US representatives signing as witnesses. The signing took place 8 May 1945 at 21:20 local time. An earlier version of the text had been signed in a ceremony in Reims in the early hours of 7 May 1945. In most of Europe, 8 May is celebrated as Victory in Europe Day; 9 May is celebrated as Victory Day in Russia, Belarus, Serbia and Israel. There were three language versions of the surrender documentRussian, English and German ‚Äì with the Russian and English versions proclaimed, in the text itself, as the only authoritative ones.  Surrender texts  Instrument of Surrender document Representatives of the then three Allied Powers, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, working through the European Advisory Commission (EAC) throughout 1944, sought to prepare an agreed surrender text to be used in the potential circumstances of Nazi power being overthrown within Germany either by military or civil authorities, and a post-Nazi government then seeking an armistice. By 3 January 1944, the Working Security Committee in the EAC proposed: The committee further suggested that the instrument of surrender be signed by representatives of the German High Command. The considerations behind this recommendation were to prevent the repetition of the stab-in-the-back legend, created in Germany following defeat in the First World War; since the act of surrender in November 1918 had been signed only by representatives of the civilian German government; militarist circles subsequently claimed that the High Command of the Army carried no responsibility for the instrument of defeat or for the defeat itself. Not everyone agreed with the Working Security Committee's predictions regarding the war's ending. Ambassador William Strang, British representative at the EAC, claimed as follows: The surrender terms for Germany were first discussed at the first EAC meeting on 14 January 1944. A definitive text was agreed on 28 July 1944, and was then adopted by the three Allied Powers. The agreed text was in three parts. The first part consisted of a brief preamble \\"The German Government and German High Command, recognising and acknowledging the complete defeat of the German armed forces on land, at sea and in the air, hereby announce Germany's unconditional surrender\\". The instrument of surrender itself followed in fourteen articles. The second part, articles 1‚Äì5, related to the military surrender by the German High Command of all forces on land, at sea and in the air, to the surrender of their weapons, to their evacuation from any territory outside German boundaries as they stood on 31 December 1937, and to their liability to captivity as prisoners of war. The third part, articles 6 to 12, related to the surrender by the German Government to Allied Representatives of almost all its powers and authority, the release and repatriation of prisoners and forced labourers, the cessation of radio broadcasts, the provision of intelligence and information, the non-destruction of weapons and infrastructure, the yielding-up of Nazi leaders for war-crime trials, and the power of Allied Representatives to issue proclamations, orders, ordinances and instructions covering \\"additional political, administrative, economic, financial, military and other requirements arising from the complete defeat of Germany\\". The key article in the third section was article 12, providing that the German Government and German High Command would comply fully with any proclamations, orders, ordinances and instructions of the accredited Allied Representatives; as this was understood by the Allies as allowing unlimited scope to impose arrangements for the restitution and reparation of war-damages. Articles 13 and 14 specified the date of surrender and the languages of the definitive texts. The Yalta Conference in February 1945 led to a further development of the terms of surrender, as it was agreed that administration of post-war Germany would be split into four occupation zones for Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union respectively. In addition, but separately, it was agreed at Yalta that an additional clause 12a would be added to the July 1944 surrender text; that the Allied Representatives \\"will take such steps, including the complete disarmament, demilitarisation and dismemberment of Germany as they deem requisite for future peace and security.\\" France, however, was not party to the Yalta agreement and refused to recognise it, which created a diplomatic problem as formal inclusion of the additional clause in the EAC text would inevitably create a French demand for equal representation in any dismemberment decisions. While this was unresolved, there were in effect two versions of the EAC text; with and without the \\"dismemberment clause\\". Moreover, by the end of March 1945, the British government had come to doubt whether, once Germany had been completely overpowered (as was the precondition for the agreed text for surrender), there would be any post-Nazi German civil authority capable of signing the instrument of surrender, or of putting its provisions into effect. They therefore proposed that the EAC text should be redrafted as a unilateral declaration of German defeat by the Allied Powers, and of their assumption of supreme authority following the total dissolution of the former German state. It was in this form that the text agreed by the EAC was finally effected as the Declaration Regarding the Defeat of Germany. In the meanwhile, the Combined Chiefs of Staff of the Western Allies had, in August 1944, agreed general guidelines for the terms of local military surrenders to be concluded with any capitulating German forces; capitulation had to be unconditional and restricted to the purely military aspects of a local surrender, no commitments were to be given to the enemy, and surrender was to be without prejudice to any subsequent general instrument of surrender which might replace any document of partial surrender and which would be jointly imposed on Germany by the three Great Powers. These guidelines formed the basis for the series of partial capitulations of German forces to the Western Allies in April and May 1945. In the event of the German signings of Instruments of Surrender at Reims and Berlin, the EAC text was not used; but a simplified, military-only version, based largely on the wording of the partial surrender instrument of German forces in Italy signed at Caserta, was applied instead. The reasons for the change are disputed but may have reflected awareness of the reservations being expressed as to the capability of the German signatories to agree the provisions of the full text or the continued uncertainty over communicating the \\"dismemberment clause\\" to the French.  Context  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler killed himself in his F√ºhrerbunker, under the Reich Chancellery, having drawn up a testament in which Admiral Karl D√∂nitz succeeded him as Head of State, with the title of Reich President. But with the fall of Berlin two days later, and American and Soviet forces having linked up at Torgau on the Elbe, the area of Germany still under German military control had been split in two. Moreover, the speed of the final Allied advances of March 1945 ‚Äì together with Hitler's insistent orders to stand and fight to the last ‚Äì had left the bulk of surviving German forces in isolated pockets and occupied territories, mostly outside the boundaries of pre-Nazi Germany. D√∂nitz attempted to form a government at Flensburg on the Danish border, and was joined there on 2 May 1945 by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) (English: \\"German High Command\\") under Wilhelm Keitel, which had previously relocated, first to Krampnitz near Potsdam, and then to Rheinsberg, during the Battle of Berlin. But, although D√∂nitz sought to present his government as 'unpolitical', there was no repudiation of Nazism, the Nazi party was not banned, leading Nazis were not detained, and the symbols of Hitlerism remained in place. Both the Soviets and the Americans remained adamant in not recognising D√∂nitz or the Flensburg Government as capable of representing the German state. At Hitler's death German armies remained in the Atlantic pockets of La Rochelle, St Nazaire, Lorient, Dunkirk and the Channel Islands; the Greek Islands of Crete, Rhodes and the Dodecanese; southern Norway; Denmark; the northwestern Netherlands; northern Croatia; northern Italy; Austria; Bohemia and Moravia; the Courland peninsula in Latvia; the Hela peninsula in Poland and in Germany towards Hamburg, facing British and Canadian forces; in Mecklenburg, Pomerania and the besieged city of Breslau, facing Soviet forces; and in southern Bavaria towards Berchtesgaden, facing American and French forces.  Instruments of partial surrender in the West  = German forces in Italy and Western Austria = German military commanders in Italy had been conducting secret negotiations for a partial surrender; which was signed at Caserta on 29 April 1945, to come into effect on 2 May. Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, with overall military command for OKW-South, initially denounced the capitulation; but once Hitler's death had been confirmed, acceded to it. = German forces in Northwest Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein = On 4 May 1945, German forces acting under instruction from the D√∂nitz Government and facing the British and Canadian 21st Army Group, signed an act of surrender at L√ºneburg Heath to come into effect on 5 May. = German forces in Bavaria and southern Germany = On 5 May 1945, all German forces in Bavaria and Southwest Germany signed an act of surrender to the Americans at Haar, outside Munich; coming into effect on 6 May. The impetus for the Caserta capitulation had arisen from within the local German military command; but from 2 May 1945, the D√∂nitz government assumed control of the process, pursuing a deliberate policy of successive partial capitulations in the west to play for time in order to bring as many as possible of the eastern military formations westwards so as to save them from Soviet or Yugoslav captivity, and surrender them intact to the British and Americans. In addition, D√∂nitz hoped to continue to evacuate soldiers and civilians by sea from the Hela peninsula and the surrounding Baltic coastal areas. D√∂nitz and Keitel were resolved against issuing any orders to surrender to Soviet forces, both from undiminished anti-Bolshevism; but also because they could not be confident they would be obeyed, and might consequently place troops continuing to fight in the position of refusing a direct order, thereby stripping them of any legal protection as prisoners of war. Following these partial capitulations, the major remaining German forces in the field (other than those bottled-up on islands and fortress-ports) consisted of Army Group Ostmark facing Soviet forces in eastern Austria and western Bohemia; Army Group E facing Yugoslav forces in Croatia; the remains of Army Group Vistula facing Soviet forces in Mecklenburg; and Army Group Centre facing Soviet forces in eastern Bohemia and Moravia. From 5 May, Army Group Centre was also engaged in the brutal suppression of the Prague uprising. An occupying army of around 400,000 well-equipped German troops remained in Norway, under the command of General Franz B√∂hme, who was contacted by the German Minister in Sweden early on 6 May, to determine whether a further partial capitulation might be arranged for his forces with neutral Sweden acting as an intermediary, but he was unwilling to comply with anything other than a general surrender order from the German High Command. The surrenders in the west had succeeded in ceasing hostilities between the Western allies and German forces on almost all fronts. At the same time however, the broadcast orders of the D√∂nitz government continued to oppose any acts of German surrender to Soviet forces in Courland, Bohemia and Mecklenburg; indeed attempting to countermand ongoing surrender negotiations both in Berlin and Breslau. German forces in the east were ordered instead to fight their way westwards. Conscious that, if this were to continue, the Soviet Command would suspect that the Western allies were intending a separate peace (as indeed was exactly D√∂nitz's intention), Eisenhower determined that no further partial surrenders would be agreed in the West; but instead instructed the D√∂nitz government to send representatives to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) headquarters in Reims, to agree terms for a general surrender of all German forces simultaneously to all the Allied powers, including the Soviets.  Surrender ceremonies  = Surrender in Reims = General Alfred Jodl signing the capitulation papers of unconditional surrender in Reims D√∂nitz's representative, Admiral Friedeburg, informed him on 6 May that Eisenhower was now insisting on \\"immediate, simultaneous and unconditional surrender on all fronts.\\" General Jodl was sent to Reims to attempt to persuade Eisenhower otherwise, but Eisenhower shortcircuited any discussion by announcing at 9.00 p.m. on the 6th that, in the absence of a complete capitulation, he would close British and American lines to surrendering German forces at midnight on 8 May and resume the bombing offensive against remaining German-held positions and towns. Jodl telegraphed this message to D√∂nitz, who responded, authorising him to sign the instrument of unconditional surrender, but subject to negotiating a 48-hour delay, ostensibly to enable the surrender order to be communicated to outlying German military units. Consequently, the first Instrument of Surrender was signed in Reims at 02:41 Central European Time (CET) on 7 May 1945. The signing took place in a red brick schoolhouse, the , that served as the SHAEF headquarters.I remember the German surrender, Kathryn Westcott, BBC News, 4 May 2005. It was to take effect at 23:01 CET (one minute after 11:00 pm, British Double Summer Time) on 8 May, the 48-hour grace period having been back-dated to the start of final negotiations.Act of Military Surrender Signed at Rheims at 0241 on the 7th day of May 1945 at The Avalon Project (Yale Law School ‚Äì The Lillian Goldman Law Library in Memory of Sol Goldman). The unconditional surrender of the German armed forces was signed by Jodl, on behalf of the OKW. Walter Bedell Smith signed on behalf of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force and General Ivan Susloparov on behalf of the Soviet High Command. French Major-General Fran√ßois Sevez signed as the official witness. Eisenhower had proceeded throughout in consultation with General Antonov of the Soviet High Command; and at his request, General Susloparov had been seconded to the SHAEF Headquarters to represent the Soviet High Command in the surrender negotiations. The text of the act of surrender had been telegraphed to General Antonov in the early hours of 7 May, but no confirmation of Soviet approval had been received by the time of the surrender ceremony, nor was there confirmation that General Susloparov was empowered to sign as representing the Soviet High Command. Accordingly, Eisenhower agreed with Susloparov that a separate text should be signed by the German emissaries; undertaking that fully empowered representatives of each of the German armed services would attend a formal ratification of the act of surrender at a time and place designated by the Allied High Commands. = Surrender in Berlin = Marshal Georgy Zhukov reading the German capitulation in Berlin. Seated on his right is Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder. Berlin-Karlshorst Field-Marshal Wilhelm Keitel signing the definitive act of unconditional surrender for the German military in Berlin Some six hours after the Reims signing, a response was received from the Soviet High Command stating that the Act of Surrender was unacceptable, both because the text differed from that agreed by the EAC, and because Susloparov had not been empowered to sign. These objections were however, pretexts; the substantive Soviet objection was that the act of surrender ought to be a unique, singular, historical event fully reflecting the leading contribution of the Soviet people to the final victory. They maintained that it should not be held on liberated territory that had been victimized by German aggression, but at the seat of government from where that German aggression sprang: Berlin. Furthermore, the Soviets pointed out that, although the terms of the surrender signed in Reims required German forces to cease all military activities and remain in their current positions; they were not explicitly required to lay down their arms and give themselves up, \\"what has to happen here is the surrender of German troops, giving themselves up as prisoners\\". Eisenhower immediately agreed, acknowledging that the act of surrender signed in Reims should be considered \\"a brief instrument of unconditional military surrender\\",Chaney p. 328 and undertook to attend with correctly accredited representatives of the German High Command for a \\"more formal signing\\" of a suitably amended text presided over by Marshal Georgy Zhukov in Berlin on 8 May. Furthermore, he issued a clarificatory statement that any German forces continuing to fight against the Soviets after the stated deadline would \\"no longer have the status of soldiers\\"; and hence, if they were to surrender to the Americans or British, would then be handed back into Soviet captivity. The effect of the Reims signing was limited to a consolidation of the effective ceasefire between German forces and the Western Allies. Fighting continued unabated in the east however, especially as German forces now intensified their air and ground assault against the Prague uprising, while the seaborne evacuation of German troops across the Baltic continued. D√∂nitz issued new commands that resistance to Soviet forces should be maintained, taking advantage of the 48-hour grace period to order redoubled efforts to save German military units from Soviet captivity; and it soon became clear that he had authorised the signing of a general surrender at Reims in bad faith, and that consequently neither the Soviet Command nor the German forces would accept the Reims surrender as effecting an end to hostilities between them. General Ferdinand Sch√∂rner commanding Army Group Centre, broadcast a message to his troops on 8 May 1945 denouncing \\"false rumours\\" that the OKW had surrendered to the Soviet Command as well as the Western Allies; \\"The struggle in the west however is over. But there can be no question of surrender to the Bolsheviks.\\" German Instrument of Surrender in Soviet magazine Pravda, 9 May 1945 Consequently, Eisenhower arranged for the commanders in chief of each of the three German armed services in person to be flown from Flensburg to Berlin early on 8 May; where they were kept waiting through the day until 10:00 p.m. when the Allied delegation arrived, at which point the amended surrender text was provided to them. The definitive Act of Military Surrender was dated as being signed before midnight on 8 MayEarl F. Ziemke References CHAPTER XV:The Victory Sealed Page 258 second last paragraph at the seat of the Soviet Military Administration in Berlin-Karlshorst, now the location of the German- Russian Museum Berlin-Karlshorst. Since Eisenhower as Supreme Allied Commander for Western Europe technically outranked Zhukov, the act of signing on behalf of the Western Allies passed to his deputy, Air Chief Marshal Tedder. The proposed Soviet amendments to the Reims surrender text were accepted without difficulty by the Western Allies; but the identification and designation of the Allied signatories proved more problematic. French forces operated under SHAEF command, but General de Gaulle was demanding that General de Tassigny sign separately for the French High Command; but in that case it would be politically unacceptable for there to be no American signature on the definitive surrender document, while the Soviets would not agree to there being more than three Allied signatories in total ‚Äì one of whom would have to be Zhukov. After repeated redrafts, all of which needed translating and retyping, it was finally agreed that both French and American signatures would be as witnesses. But the consequence was that the final versions were not ready for signing until after midnight. Consequently, the physical signing was delayed until nearly 1.00 a.m. on 9 May, Central European Time; and then back- dated to 8 May to be consistent with the Reims agreement and the public announcements of the surrender already made by Western leaders. The definitive Act of Military Surrender differed from the Reims signing principally in respect of requiring three German signatories, who could fully represent all three armed services together with the German High Command. Otherwise the amended text set out an expanded article 2, now requiring German forces to disarm and hand over their weapons to local allied commanders. This clause had the effect of ensuring that German military forces would not only cease military operations against regular allied forces; but would also disarm themselves, disband, and be taken into captivity. Field Marshal Keitel initially balked at the amended text, proposing that an additional grace period of 12 hours be granted to surrendering German forces, before they might be exposed to punitive action for non-compliance under article 5. In the event, he had to be satisfied with a verbal assurance from Zhukov. Admiral Friedeburg was the only representative of the German forces to be present at the signing of the German instruments of surrender at Luneburg Heath on 4 May 1945, in Reims on 7 May and in Berlin on 8 May 1945. Generaladmiral von Friedeburg committed suicide shortly afterwards, on 23 May 1945, upon the dissolution of the Flensburg Government. For the most part, the Berlin signing did the job required of it; with German forces in Courland and the Atlantic outposts all surrendering on 9 May within the informal 12-hour grace period. Surrender to the Soviets in Bohemia and Moravia took rather longer to achieve, with some German forces in Bohemia continuing to attempt to fight their way towards the American lines. Nevertheless, the principle of a common surrender broadly held; and units seeking to defy it were denied passage west, perforce having to surrender to the Soviets. The exception was Army Group E in Croatia, which fought on for several days attempting to force an escape from the partisan forces of Marshal Tito, such that many soldiers from these units did succeed in surrendering to General Alexander in Italy. These included considerable numbers of Ustase collaboration troops, who were subsequently returned to Yugoslavia; and who were all promptly executed without trial.  VE Day and Victory Day  The Reims signing ceremony had been attended by considerable numbers of reporters, all of whom were bound by a 36-hour embargo against reporting the capitulation. As it became clear that there would need to be a definitive second signing before the Act of Surrender could become operative, Eisenhower agreed that the news blackout should remain; so that all Allied powers could celebrate Victory in Europe together on 9 May 1945. However, Edward Kennedy of the Associated Press news agency in Paris broke the embargo on 7 May, with the consequence that the German surrender was headline news in the western media on 8 May. Realising that it had become politically impossible to keep to the original timetable, it was eventually agreed that the Western Allies would celebrate Victory in Europe Day on 8 May, but that western leaders would not make their formal proclamations of Victory until that evening (when the Berlin signing ceremony should be imminent). The Soviet government made no public acknowledgement of the Reims signing, which they did not recognise; and so, maintaining the original dates, celebrated Victory Day on 9 May 1945. The signing in Berlin took place on 9 May 1945 at 00:16 local time. The capitulation was effective retrospectively, from 8 May 1945 at 23:01 Central European Time. That means time of both signing and capitulation was on 9 May according to Moscow Time.  Declaration regarding the defeat of Germany  Although the German military signatories of the May 1945 German Instruments of Surrender had been acting under instructions from Admiral D√∂nitz, none of the Allied Governments recognised the acting Flensburg Government as validly exercising civil power, and consequently the Allies had insisted that the German signatories should explicitly represent the German High Command alone. On 23 May 1945, the purported German government in Flensburg was abolished, and its members taken into captivity as prisoners of war. = Diplomatic relations and embassies = During 1944 and 1945 formerly neutral countries, and former German allies, had been joining the Allied powers and declaring war on Germany. The German embassies to these countries had been closed down, with their property and archives held in trust by a nominated protecting power (usually Switzerland or Sweden) under the terms of the Geneva Conventions; with counterpart arrangements for the former embassies of Allied countries in Berlin. The United States State Department had prepared for the diplomatic consequences of the war's ending on the assumption that there would have been an explicit statement of unconditional surrender of the German state in accordance with the agreed EAC surrender text. In the final days of April 1945, the State Department had notified the protecting powers, and all other remaining neutral governments (such as Ireland), that following the forthcoming German surrender, the continued identity of the German state would rest solely in the four Allied Powers, who would immediately recall all German diplomatic staff, take ownership of all German state property, extinguish all protecting power functions, and require the transfer of all archives and records to one or another of the embassies of the western Allies. On 8 May 1945, these arrangements were put into effect in full, notwithstanding that the only German parties to the signed surrender document had been the German High Command; the western Allies maintaining that a functioning German state had already ceased to exist, and consequently that the surrender of the German military had effected the complete termination of Nazi Germany. As the protecting powers complied fully with the Allied demands, the German state ceased as a diplomatic entity on 8 May 1945 (Imperial Japan, the only remaining Axis belligerent, having already denounced the German surrender and unilaterally seized the German embassy in Tokyo). = Berlin Declaration (1945) = Nevertheless, as the surrender instrument of 8 May 1945 had been signed only by German military representatives, the full civil provisions for the unconditional surrender of Germany remained without explicit formal basis. Consequently, the EAC text for Unconditional Surrender of Germany, redrafted as a declaration and with an extended explanatory preamble, was adopted unilaterally by the now four Allied Powers as the Declaration regarding the defeat of Germany on 5 June 1945. This spelled out the Allied position that as a result of its complete defeat Germany had no government or central authority, and that the vacated civil authority in Germany had consequently been assumed solely by the four Allied Representative Powers (the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the French Republic) on behalf of the Allied Governments overall, an authority subsequently constituted into the Allied Control Council. Stalin had, however, already backtracked on his previous support for the principle of German dismemberment, publicly renouncing any such policy in his victory proclamation to the Soviet people of 8 May 1945. Consequently, there was no \\"dismemberment clause\\" in the Berlin declaration text.

Zhu studied at Peking University, and during the May Fourth Movement became one of several pioneers of modernism in China during the 1920s. Zhu was a prolific writer of both prose and poetry, but is best known for essays like \\"Retreating Figure\\" (), and \\"You. Me.\\" (). His best known work in verse is the long poem \\"Destruction\\" or Huimie (). Early life In 1916, Zhu graduated from Secondary school and entered Peking University where he fell in love and married Wu Zhongqian (). A year later, he changed his name from Zihua to Ziqing, the name change was said to be due to his family's dire economic conditions. Zhu graduated in 1920, and went to various secondary schools in Hangzhou, Yangzhou, Shanghai and Ningbo to teach. During his time as a teacher, he was also active in the poetry circles, and became a well-known poet. The essay \\"\\" (Green) was written by Zhu Ziqing about the beauty of Meiyu Pond () and waterfall in the Middle Yandang Mountains in Xianyan Subdistrict, Ouhai District, Wenzhou of southeastern Zhejiang province in eastern China after his visits to the area in 1923.

Academia Later, he was appointed professor of Chinese Literature at Tsinghua University in 1925, and on August 1928, he published his first essay collection known as \\"Retreating Figure\\". The book became a wild hit and he soon established his name as a prolific author and poet. However, Zhu's wife soon died which was a terrible blow to Zhu. From 1931 to 1932 he studied English Literature and Linguistics in London. He married his second wife Chen Zhuyin and continued to teach at Tsinghua University. In 1937, when the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Zhu followed his university to move to Changsha, Kunming and Chengdu. During this time, Zhu continued to teach in other universities. Later years and death After the Second World War, Zhu encouraged his students in Kunming to oppose Chiang Kai-shek for starting the Chinese Civil War. In 1946, he returned to Beijing and was appointed the Head of the Chinese Language Department in Tsinghua University. When he heard of the assassination of patriotic authors Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, Zhu disregarded his own safety to attend the funeral of both men. Zhu later died on August 12, 1948 after joining the rebellion of refusing aid from the United States. Though it is a common belief that Zhu died of starvation due to Mao Zedong's famous article \\"Farewell, Leighton Stuart\\". However, the real cause of Zhu's death was gastric perforation resulting from his severe stomach ulcers. References  Portrait  * Zhu Ziqing.

The river is a popular and economically important sportfishing destination, and the most heavily fished of New York's Lake Ontario tributaries. From its headwaters in the Tug Hill region of New York, it flows westward through two hydroelectric dams and over the Salmon River Falls before it empties into eastern Lake Ontario at Port Ontario in Oswego County. The Salmon River watershed drains approximately . The river is noted for its recreational salmon fishery, which is sustained by the efforts of the Salmon River Fish Hatchery, located north of Altmar on a tributary to the Salmon River. Hatchery staff raise over three million young trout and salmon each year to be stocked in streams and lakes throughout New York State, including the Salmon River itself. The Salmon River derives its name from the landlocked Atlantic salmon which were of great importance to Native Americans and early settlers of the region. However, these native salmon were extirpated from the river by 1872 and from Lake Ontario by 1898. Since the late 1960s, the Salmon River has been stocked primarily with Chinook salmon, coho salmon, steelhead, and brown trout, in addition to a smaller proportion of Atlantic salmon. These fish return to the river for annual spawning runs after spending a majority of the year in Lake Ontario. The river is also a popular location for kayaking and river rafting during parts of the year when water from the Lighthouse Hill Dam is released, with several companies making excursions to the river. Course The Salmon River includes several distinct reaches and features between its headwaters and mouth. =Headwaters and upper tributaries= The headwaters of the Salmon River are located in western Lewis County, within New York's Tug Hill region. The primary upper tributaries of the Salmon River are the North Branch Salmon River (itself fed by the Mad River) and East Branch Salmon River. The river's upper reaches are heavily forested and sparsely populated, allowing for the water quality of the river to be extremely high. =Salmon River Reservoir= View of the dam that impounds the upper Salmon River Reservoir, October 2008. The Salmon River Reservoir, also known as the Redfield Reservoir, is a man-made waterbody in Oswego County (). The reservoir was created with the completion of a hydroelectric dam in 1912. It covers an area of with a maximum depth of and has the capacity to hold of water. It is the larger of the Salmon River's two reservoirs. =Salmon River Falls= Salmon River Falls, May 2009. The Salmon River Falls is a waterfall in Oswego County, located between the Salmon River's two reservoirs. It is situated within the Salmon River Falls Unique Area, managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The falls and surrounding land was owned by the Niagara Mohawk power company prior to 1993, when ownership was transferred to New York State. The area has since been improved with parking areas, wheelchair-accessible trails, and interpretive kiosks, and is a popular sightseeing destination in the region. Historically, the falls were the natural upstream limit for spawning salmon in the river prior to the construction of the Lighthouse Hill Dam. =Lighthouse Hill Reservoir= The Lighthouse Hill Reservoir, also known as the Lower Salmon River Reservoir, is located in Oswego County near Altmar, about downstream of the Salmon River Reservoir (). The reservoir was created with the completion of the Lighthouse Hill Dam in 1930, which currently represents the first barrier to upstream migration for salmon and trout. =Main stem= The Salmon River's main stem stretches for below the Lighthouse Hill Dam before it reaches the river's mouth at Lake Ontario, passing through Altmar and Pulaski on the way. This portion of the river is directly accessible by river-running salmon from Lake Ontario, and consequently, this is the stretch of the river that is most heavily utilized by anglers. The amount of water flowing in the river's main stem is controlled by the Lighthouse Hill Dam, including summertime recreational releases of water to enhance whitewater rafting opportunities. Two tributaries, Trout Brook and Orwell Brook, enter the river below the dam and are also accessible to migrating salmon and trout, where they are actively sought by anglers. Salmon may also run up a third tributary, Beaverdam Brook, however fishing is restricted on that stream due to its association with the Salmon River Fish Hatchery. The hatchery connects to the stream, where it directly takes in broodstock and releases juvenile hatchery-raised fish. Geology The Salmon River passes through a region with sedimentary bedrock composed of limestone, shale, siltstone and sandstone. After the uplifting of the Appalachian Plateau approximately 220 million years ago, numerous streams in the area, including the Salmon River and its tributaries, began to cut gorges (locally known as \\"gulfs\\") through the bedrock. The geologically recent Pleistocene glaciations further influenced the landscape approximately 12,000 years ago; the region's soils in particular are the result of deposits of glacial till from this time. Soils in the Salmon River region are generally stony, acidic, and poorly drained. History =General history= Prior to European colonization, the Salmon River and its surrounding area was important to the Iroquois Confederacy as seasonal hunting and fishing grounds. Among their names for the river was Heh-hah-wa-gah, meaning \\"where swim the sweet fish\\". Additional names included A-han-ha-ge, Ca-no-ha-ge (meaning \\"a creek\\" or \\"river\\"), Otihatangue (meaning \\"a large clearing\\", referring to natural meadows near the river's mouth), and Ga-hen-we-gah. The river also served as passage to interior hunting grounds, and was described in 1688 as \\"the place where the greater part of the Iroqouis embarked to go upon the trail of the beaver\\", in reference to their excursions into the Lesser Wilderness, now known as the Tug Hill. Guillaume de l'Isle's Carte de la Louisiane et du cours du Mississipi from 1718 showing the eastern Great Lakes region. La Famine, the French name for the Salmon River, is shown near the southeastern corner of Lake Ontario. In 1615, French explorer Samuel de Champlain and Jesuit missionaries, including Simon Le Moyne, explored the river and the surrounding area, which would be claimed as part of New France. Early maps and accounts refer to the river by its French name of La Famine, a name referencing the hunger of French colonists who passed through the area in 1656; an Iroquois settlement known as Cahihonovage (or Cahihonovague) was also on noted on its south shore, near present-day Port Ontario. La Famine was described as a \\"well-known stopping-place upon the eastern shore of Lake Ontario for the weary hunter and the bold explorer, and the spot where even armies encamped, and the ambassadors of hostile nations met in solemn council.\\" Records from Jesuit missionaries as early as 1657 make note of Iroquois fishermen taking large quantities of Atlantic salmon from the river, which would then be dried or smoked to preserve it for the upcoming winter. One early source observed that the river contained so many salmon that the Iroquois \\"often brought up a hundred at one cast of the net.\\" The Salmon River at this time was noted for its natural harbor and abundance of fish. As such, the lower river was contested between the French, British and Iroquois during the French and Indian Wars from 1688 to 1763; ultimately the British would hold control of the region following these conflicts. Their control was short-lived, however, as the United States gained its independence from Great Britain following the American Revolution in 1783; the region's Iroquois were also substantially weakened, having suffered losses due to siding with the British during this time. Selkirk Lighthouse, near the mouth of the Salmon River, was built in 1837. The first permanent American settlement in the area was built by Nathan Tuttle and Nathan Wilcox in 1801 near the mouth of the Salmon River. Upstream, what was to become the village of Pulaski began as a single log cabin constructed in 1804 by Benjamin Winch. The stone Selkirk Lighthouse was built near the river's mouth in 1838 and survives to this day; the lighthouse served both to aid navigation along the Lake Ontario shore, and as a location to collect tariffs on items imported from Canada. The river has historically served as a source of both food and hydro-power, and numerous dams and mills were built along the river during the 1800s. Though these dams served the needs of the growing human population along the river, they also impeded movement of salmon seeking access to upstream spawning grounds, and they contributed to the eventual extirpation of landlocked Atlantic salmon from the river by 1872. In 1847, residents of the region filed proposed legislation to separate from Oswego County and form \\"Salmon County\\" with Pulaski as the county seat. The legislation did not advance beyond the initial filing in the New York State Assembly. The Salmon River underwent extensive changes in the early 1900s with the construction of hydroelectric dams and their associated reservoirs. Between 1912 and 1930, dams and reservoirs were constructed both upstream and downstream of the Salmon River Falls. A major flood occurred along the Salmon River and its tributaries between December 29, 1984 and January 2, 1985. Rapid snowmelt combined with heavy rainfall (as much as near the Salmon River's headwaters) caused extensive flood damage along the river, destroying bridges near Redfield and Osceola and damaging roads, bridges and homes in Pulaski and Altmar. On September 30, 2010, large amounts of rain fell within a matter of several hours in the Salmon River drainage area, ranging from , causing historic flooding. The water was so high that the \\"Short Bridge\\" in the center of downtown Pulaski was nearly overtopped by the high water, and a portion of a retaining wall on the north side of the river directly downstream from the bridge was washed away. During the flood, 26,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water was reported as flowing through the river; this was only slightly less than the massive flood event in 1984, which saw 29,000 cfs of water rushing through the river. River levels during early fall are typically between 350 and 700 cfs. There were reports and photos of salmon seen swimming in flooded parking lots and roads, and of anglers targeting these fish. =History of fisheries management= Young Atlantic salmon are transferred to buckets just prior to release into the Salmon River in September 2011. Salmon River Atlantic salmon populations declined rapidly in the mid-19th century due to overfishing, pollution, and the construction of numerous dams preventing access to spawning grounds. By 1872, these native salmon were extirpated from the river. Between 1873 and 1898, approximately 1.1 million Chinook salmon were stocked in the Salmon River; however stocking ceased once it was demonstrated that no natural reproduction of these salmon was taking place. This same period of time saw the stocking of 144,000 Atlantic salmon fry, however poor survival of these fish led to this program being discontinued as well. By 1898, all salmon in Lake Ontario were apparently extirpated. Several additional attempts to establish spawning populations of Chinook, coho and Atlantic salmon in the river took place between 1939 and 1959. In each instance, failure to document subsequent natural reproduction led to each program being discontinued. Poor river conditions, pollution, and the impacts of parasitic sea lampreys contributed to the failure of these stocking programs. The extirpation of lake trout from Lake Ontario in the 1950s left the large lake without an apex predator, leaving prey fish such as alewife and smelt with no natural means of control. Alewife populations exploded, sometimes to the point of causing die-offs large enough to require the use of bulldozers along Great Lakes' beaches. Seeking to control prey fish populations, the aggressive stocking of coho and Chinook salmon resumed throughout the Great Lakes and their tributaries. In 1968, 22,000 coho salmon were stocked in the Salmon River, marking the beginning of the current era of salmon sportfishing on the river. Chinook salmon were stocked beginning in 1970. Initial returns were poor, and would remain so until successful sea lamprey control began in 1972. By 1974, large salmon runs were observed regularly in the Salmon River, and steelhead were initially stocked beginning in that year as well. The Salmon River Fish Hatchery opened in 1980. To support the growing Lake Ontario sportfishing industry, the Salmon River Fish Hatchery was built in 1980 on Beaverdam Brook, a tributary to the Salmon River near Altmar. The hatchery receives its Chinook, coho and steelhead broodstock directly from river-running fish that are allowed directly into the hatchery. The facility also raises brown trout and Atlantic salmon using eggs received from other facilities. In total, the hatchery raises nearly three million young fish for release into New York's waters each year. Fishing regulations and stocking levels have changed throughout the years in response to prey fish abundance, habitat conditions, and social pressure. Between 1976 and 1977, possession of salmon caught in Lake Ontario or its tributaries was banned due to elevated levels of chemical contaminants such as Mirex and PCBs. In 1995, the practice of snagging was banned due to ethical concerns and social problems on the river (see Snagging ban section below). For many years, flow rates in the river's main stem below the Lighthouse Hill Dam changed frequently and dramatically as water was released in response to variable demands for electricity. The 1996 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's re-licensing agreement for hydroelectric power generation on the river regulated river flows, with the goal of improving the river's natural habitat. Managed flows led to significant increases in natural reproduction of Chinook salmon within the river, and enhanced the recreational appeal of the river through planned high-water releases that provide opportunities for white-water rafting throughout the summer. The stocking of Atlantic salmon resumed in the Salmon River in 1995. Small returns several years later established a limited summer fishery. However, it was not until 2009 that successful natural reproduction of Atlantic salmon was observed. This marked the first time naturally reproduced Atlantic salmon were found in the Salmon River in over a century. In 2015, the Salmon River was stocked with 360,000 Chinook salmon, 90,000 coho salmon, 30,000 Atlantic salmon, 263,220 steelhead, 1,150 rainbow trout, 1,200 brown trout, and 910 brook trout. These numbers include fish released directly from the Salmon River Fish Hatchery into Beaverdam Brook, a tributary of the Salmon River. Sportfishing The Salmon River is a popular sportfishing destination, particularly during the fall and early spring months. It was estimated in 2007 that anglers spend nearly 201 million (USD) annually at the Salmon River. More angler effort was expended on the Salmon River during the 2011-2012 season than on all other New York Lake Ontario tributaries combined, with 68% of all tributary fishing activity occurring on the Salmon River. This proportion is rising; the Salmon River accounted for 58% of all effort in 2005-2006 and 64% in 2006-2007. Approximately 60% of anglers on the Salmon River are not residents of the region. The majority of sportfishing activity on the Salmon River takes place on the portion of the river that stretches between Lake Ontario and the Lighthouse Hill Dam in Altmar. Here, anglers target river-running salmon and trout species that move upstream from the lake in order to spawn. The anadromous sportfish species that comprise these seasonal runs are the Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho salmon (O. kisutch), brown trout (Salmo trutta), Atlantic salmon (S. salar), and winter and summer-run strains of steelhead (O. mykiss). Salmon fishing on the river is accomplished either by casting from shore, using waders to fish from within the river, or fishing from a drift boat, typically operated by a guide. The abundance of prey fish in Lake Ontario allow these river-running fish to often attain great size. Two world record fish have been taken from the Salmon River: A coho salmon was landed in 1989, and a Chinook-coho hybrid was caught in 2001. In addition, the current Great Lakes record for a Chinook salmon was taken from the Salmon River in 1991, and weighed in at . =Angler access= Anglers are able to directly access a majority of the lower river due to the presence of conservation easements on otherwise private land, in addition to numerous parking areas and access trails maintained by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and local municipalities. Permanent \\"public fishing rights\\" easements were secured by New York State on approximately of the river's shoreline after the divestment of Niagara Mohawk's former land holdings along the river. The easements only allow access for the purpose of fishing; other activities, such as camping and hunting, are not permitted. Special fly fishing and catch and release-only areas are available above Altmar. Paid-only access is available on the stretch of the river below Pulaski and above the NYS Route 3 bridge in an area where no easements exist, known as the Douglaston Salmon Run. =Fall season= Salmon-seeking anglers on the lower Salmon River near Port Ontario in October 2007. Fishing activity is greatest during the fall salmon runs, which peak between mid September and early November. During this time, Chinook and coho salmon complete their spawning runs, with the majority of coho usually following the earlier Chinook runs. Both species are semelparous, meaning that they die after spawning. Bait presentation strategies must therefore stimulate the aggressive nature of these fish to provoke them to strike, as they do not feed after entering the river. Although less prevalent than Chinook and coho salmon, landlocked Atlantic salmon also spawn in the Salmon River during the fall. Most spawn in October and November, though some may enter the river as early as July. These fish are iteroparous, capable of spawning multiple times during their lifespan, and many will return to Lake Ontario after spawning. =Winter, spring and summer seasons= As the Chinook and coho runs begin to fade, some steelhead and brown trout will begin to enter the river to feed on salmon eggs. Some of these fish will remain in the river throughout the winter before spawning between mid-March and early April, at which time greater numbers of fish will enter the river. Fishing activity on the Salmon River once again peaks during this spring spawning season. Both brown trout and steelhead are capable of spawning multiple times during their lifespan, and many \\"drop back\\" to Lake Ontario after spawning; these fish are aggressive feeders and popular targets of anglers. The stocking of so-called summer-run steelhead (skamania) aims to increase summer trout fishing opportunities on the Salmon River, as these fish tend to enter the river as early as June. =Recreational fishing above the main stem= Although river-running salmon and trout cannot migrate beyond the Lighthouse Hill Dam, the reservoirs and river stretches beyond the dam are also utilized by anglers, although to a lesser degree than the lower river. The Lighthouse Hill Reservoir contains gamefish such as resident rainbow trout, largemouth bass and brown trout, in addition to more typical species such as yellow perch, rock bass, brown bullhead, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish. The upper Salmon River Reservoir contains both largemouth and smallmouth bass, in addition to some walleye, brown trout, brook trout and rainbow trout; black crappie, yellow perch and bluegill are also present in the reservoir. Above the upper reservoir, the North Branch Salmon River and the Mad River are both annually stocked with brook trout, while the East Branch Salmon River is annually stocked with both rainbow trout and brook trout. Regulations Anglers on the Salmon River must abide by New York State's general freshwater fishing regulations, in addition to special regulations that apply only to the main stem of the Salmon River. =Snagging ban= Snagging, the indiscriminate taking of fish using weighted hooks that are ripped through the water with quick jerking motions, was controversially outlawed on the Salmon River in the early 1990s. It had previously been argued that snagging was ethical due to the difficulty in enticing Chinook and coho salmon to strike, as these fish die after spawning and do not feed once they enter the river. However, proponents of the snagging ban noted that the river also contained several species that survive beyond their spawning seasons, such as steelhead, brown trout and Atlantic salmon; snagging could not possibly avoid impacting these fish as well. In addition, snagging opponents claimed that the practice was unethical as it violated the doctrine of \\"fair chase\\", and noted that snagging was associated with both injuries and problematic behavior, such as littering, the targeting of fish merely to harvest their eggs for profit, and fistfights among anglers. Snagging had been banned on many New York State waters before the early 1990s, however the practice continued on the Salmon River and several other Lake Ontario tributaries due to fears of potential negative economic impacts caused by the ban. One economic impact study predicted that angler effort would decrease by about 25% if a ban was in place. Despite these concerns, New York State went ahead with enacting the ban which eventually became law in 1995. The popularity of salmon fishing in the general Lake Ontario region did wane in the late 1990s, and the snagging ban may have contributed to this decrease. However, the 2000s saw a revival in the popularity of salmon fishing on the Salmon River, and today the river is once again among the most heavily fished streams in all of New York State. In addition, the level of sportsmanship and the general atmosphere along the Salmon River is described as having improved since the ban was put in place. Although the snagging ban has been in place for more than 20 years, some illegal snagging activities still persist on the river. Enforcement of the ban is a major priority for Environmental Conservation Officers who patrol the river during peak salmon season, sometimes using stealth and undercover techniques to catch snaggers in the act.

He was the founder of the fashion house Hugo Boss AG. He was an active member of the Nazi Party as early as 1931 and remained loyal to the Nazi German ideology throughout the duration of the party's existence. Early life Boss was born in Metzingen, Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, to Luise (n√©e M√ºnzenmayer) and Heinrich Boss, the youngest of five children. He apprenticed as a merchant, did his military service from 1903 to 1905, and then worked in a weaving mill in Konstanz. He took over his parents' lingerie shop in Metzingen in 1908, as heir. In 1914, he was mobilized into the army and served through World War I, ending it as a corporal. Personal life Boss married Anna Katharina Freysinger in 1908. They had one son named Siegfried Boss in 1914. Hugo Boss company Boss founded his own clothing company in Metzingen in 1923 and then opened a factory in 1924, initially with two partners. The company produced shirts and jackets and later work clothing, sportswear, and raincoats. In the 1930s, it produced uniforms for the SA, the SS,Lumsden, Robin.

In 1999, US lawyers acting on behalf of Holocaust survivors started legal proceedings against the Hugo Boss company over the use of slave labour during the war. The misuse of 140 Polish and 40 French forced workers led to an apology by the company. After World War II, the denazification process saw Boss initially labeled as an \\"activist, supporter and beneficiary\\" of National Socialism, which resulted in a heavy fine, also stripping him of his voting rights and of his capacity to run a business. However, this initial ruling was appealed, and Boss was re-labeled as a \\"follower\\", a category with a less severe punishment. Nevertheless, the effects of the ban led to Boss's son-in-law, Eugen Holy, taking over both the ownership and the running of the company. Death Boss died of a tooth abscess in 1948.

Hopman was born in Glebe, Sydney, New South Wales, before his family moved to Parramatta, a city adjoining Sydney and now effectively a suburb of the metropolis. Hopman was a student at Rosehill Public Primary (elementary) school, where his father was headmaster, and later at Parramatta High School, where he played tennis and cricket. Early life Harry Hopman was born on 12 August 1906 in Glebe, Sydney as the third child of John Henry Hopman, schoolteacher, and Jennie Siberteen, n√©e Glad. He started playing tennis at the age of 13 and, playing barefoot, won an open singles tournament on a court in the playground of Rosehill Public School, where his father was headmaster. Davis Cup Harry Hopman in Brisbane in 1931 Hopman was the successful captain-coach of 22 Australian Davis Cup teams from 1939 to 1967. With players such as Frank Sedgman, Ken McGregor, Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Rod Laver, Neale Fraser, John Newcombe, Fred Stolle, Tony Roche, Roy Emerson, Ashley Cooper, Rex Hartwig, Mervyn Rose, and Mal Anderson, he won the cup an unmatched 16 times. In late 1951, when it appeared that Davis Cup player Frank Sedgman was about to turn professional, Hopman used his column in the Melbourne Herald to lead a fundraising campaign designed to keep Sedgman in the amateur ranks. Enough money was raised to purchase a gasoline station in the name of Sedgman's wife- to-be and Sedgman remained an amateur for one more year. As Joe McCauley writes in The History of Professional Tennis, \\"For some reason, the pious Hopman, a strong opponent of the paid game, did not regard this as an infringement of Sedgman's amateur status.\\"The History of Professional Tennis (2003) Joe McCauley, p. 58. Journalism Harry Hopman hitting an overhead in the 1930s Hopman was also a journalist, joining the Melbourne Herald in 1933 as a sportswriter. He provided sporting commentary. After World War II, this became his focus until he was once again coaxed into tennis coaching. As an example of Hopman's journalism, Kramer writes that Sedgman, by then a successful touring professional, once \\"volunteered to help train the Aussie Davis Cup team. Hopman accepted the offer, and then he took Sedg aside and told him that what Hoad and Rosewall needed was confidence. So he told Sedg to go easy on them, which he gladly did. After a few days, Hopman wrote an exclusive in his newspaper column revealing how his kids could whip Sedgman and how this proved once again that amateurs were better than the pros.\\" Legacy The Hopman Cup is named in his honour. His widow, Lucy Hopman, travels to Perth, Western Australia in January each year for the tournament. Hopman was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1978. Tennis great Jack Kramer, who was also a successful promoter of the professional tour, writes in his 1979 autobiography that Hopman \\"always knew exactly what was going on with all his amateurs. He had no children, no hobbies, and tennis was everything to him. Hopman always said he hated the pros, and he battled open tennis to the bitter end, but as early as the time when Sedgman and McGregor signed, Hopman was trying to get himself included in the deal so he could get a job with pro tennis in America.\\" Kramer, who admits that Hopman \\"has never been my favorite guy\\", goes on to say: \\"The minute one of his stars would turn pro, Hopman would turn on him. No matter how close he'd been to a player, as soon as he was out of Hopman's control, the guy was an outcast. 'It was as if we'd never existed' Rosewall said once.\\" Personal life Hopman was first married to Nell Hall, with whom he won four mixed doubles finals. The marriage took place on 19 March 1934 at St Philip's Anglican Church in Sydney. She died of an intracranial tumour on 10 January 1968. Hopman emigrated to the United States in 1969 and became a successful professional coach, at Port Washington Tennis Academy, of future champions such as Vitas Gerulaitis and later John McEnroe. Hopman later opened the Harry Hopman's International Tennis camp in Treasure Island then Largo, Florida, with his second wife, Lucy Pope Fox, whom he married on 2 February 1971. Hopman died of a heart attack on 27 December 1985.

It was distributed throughout Calgary, Banff and Canmore. It is owned by Great West Newspapers, LP. With an assessed readership of 70,000 upon a distributed circulation of 30,000, the paper was one of the most widely circulated and well-respected alternative newspapers in Canada. FFWD ran with a sales staff of 4 incredibly talented individuals at any given time. Some of the notables over the years include Scott Preston, Melissa Mercier, Natasha Solvason and Den Williams. The paper originated in December 1995 as Calgary's first alternative weekly publication.The Peak: \\"Dan McLeod's Straight\\" (refers to history and role of FFWD) As of 2007, it was the only freely-distributed weekly newspaper of its type in the city, having outlasted a number of competitors including a short-lived Calgary edition of The Georgia Straight, which had originally been called VOX, the long-running Calgary Mirror (which folded in 2001), and the Mirrors successor, FYI Calgary In- Print, which ran for only five months in 2001. While the paper was initially arts-focused, in it later began covering more news stories and social issues. In 2008, the paper was criticized over publishing a controversial article quoting Calgary Conservative MP Lee Richardson on comments regarding immigrants and crime which he later stated he regretted; clarifying he was referring only to youth gangs in the city. Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the reporting \\"gotcha journalism\\" for taking his comments out of their intended context, while other party leaders called for his resignation. One of Fast Forward's most popular editions was its annual Best of Calgary readers' poll. For this, readers voluntarily submitted their responses to a large variety of questions, indicating their favourite (or least favourite) aspects of Calgary, including its food, people, culture, infrastructure, political leadership and more. After 19 years, Fast Forward Weekly shut down.

In numerous Shanghai magazines, he went by the English name George Njal, after a character in Njal's Saga.Jones. Andrew F. [2001] (2001). Yellow Music - CL: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age. Duke University Press. p. 122. Biography Nie Er's ancestors were from Yuxi, Yunnan, in southwest China. He was born in Kunming, Yunnan. From an early age Nie Er displayed an interest in music. From 1918 he studied at the Kunming Normal School's Affiliated Primary School. In his spare time, he learnt to play traditional instruments such as the dizi, erhu, sanxian, and yueqin, and became the conductor of the school's Children's Orchestra. In 1922 he entered the Private Qiushi Primary School (Senior Section), and in 1925 entered Yunnan Provincial Number One Combined Middle School. In 1927 Nie Er graduated from Yunnan Provincial Number One Combined Middle School, and entered Yunnan Provincial Number One Normal School. At school, he participated in the book club, and organised the Nine-Nine Music Society, which performed within the school and outside. During this time, he learnt to play the violin and piano. In June 1931, Nie Er entered the Mingyue Musical Drama Society as a violinist. In July 1932 he published A Short Treatise on Chinese Song and Dance, in which he criticised the Drama Society's president, Li Jinhui, as a result of which he was forced to leave the society. Prior to joining the Lianhua Film Studio on November 1932, he took part in shaping the Bright Moonlight Song and Dance Troupe. He later joined the musical group of the Friends of the Soviet Union Society. He also organized the Chinese Contemporary Music Research Group, which participated in the Leftist Dramatist's Union. In 1933, Nie Er joined the Communist Party of China. In April 1934, Nie Er joined Path√© Records and managed the musical section. In the same year he founded the Path√© National Orchestra. This was a prolific year for Nie Er in terms of musical output. In January 1935 Nie Er became the director of the musical department of Lianhua Number Two Studio. In April 1935, Nie Er went to Japan to meet his elder brother in Tokyo. There, he composed the \\"March of the Volunteers\\", which would later become the national anthem of China. Name When Shouxin was young he showed signs of musical talent. He was able to imitate the voices of people he knew, and almost any sound that entered his ears. He could learn any song just by listening to it twice. Thus, people began to call him \\"Ears\\" (ËÄ≥). In addition to having musically trained ears, Shouxin was able to move each of his ears independently. This earned him another nickname, \\"Doctor Ears\\". Shouxin felt that his nickname is interesting and said that \\"Since friends give me one more ears, I will have one more ears from now on\\". Later on, he changed his name to be Nie Er (ËÅÇËÄ≥). Death On July 17, 1935, he died while swimming in Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan, at the age of twenty-three. He may have been en route to the Soviet Union, passing through Japan to receive training, sent by the Chinese Communist Party. Some suspect that he was killed by the Japanese, while others believe that he was killed by Chinese Nationalists, as he was in Japan to flee from them. However, because he disappeared while swimming with friends, this made the possibility of assassination difficult and highly unlikely. Evidence points to drowning as the most probable cause of death. He was found by the local rescue team the following day. According to the rescue team and the police, his body was not different from that of ordinary drowned bodies. Compositions Nie Er (left) and Tian Han (right), respectively the composer and lyricist of \\"March of the Volunteers\\", now China's national anthem, photographed in Shanghai in 1933 Nie Er wrote a total of 37 pieces in his life, all in the three years before his death. A significant proportion of these songs reflected working class life and struggles. He often collaborated with lyricist Tian Han.

It is not only because his \\"March of the Volunteers\\" was later adopted as the present national anthem of the People's Republic of China, but in his short life, he created for the people many other songs and instrumental pieces. Some of his works reflected the sufferings and groaning of the broad mass of the labouring people at that time, and others were an expression of the patriotism and resistance of the Chinese people in face of the Japanese aggression. His works, some full of tremendous momentum and imbued with the spirit of the age, some lyrical, graceful and in a strongly national style, were not only great favourites of Chinese at home and abroad then, but are also still treasured by the Chinese people today as precious elements of the Chinese national music, Though his career as a composer lasted for only two years, from the publishing of his first composition to his accidental death when swimming in the sea of Japan, his works have had a uniquely profound influence on modern Chinese music. =Film= In 1959, on the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, China produced a biopic entitled Nie Er, retelling the story of Nie Er and his composition of the Chinese National Anthem. =Nie Er Piano= Nie Er Piano was founded by Zhu Xuegong at Shanghai in 1958. The brand hires German piano construction experts and uses American advanced technology to build its own pianos. The Nie Er brand piano has become one of the most successful piano brands in China. =Nie Er Park= Nie Er Park is located on the northernmost of Yuxi City, it occupied 100,000 square meters, which was completed in July 1987. It is a comprehensive park that can be used for relaxing, entertaining, and promoting culture. The whole park is divided into parts that are for commemoration, entertaining, relaxation, cultural activities, children's play, ornamental flowers, and park administration. Nie Er's statue is the main body of the commemorative part. The statue is 2.4 meters tall, weighs 1.8 tons, and faces north. The height of the platform under the statue is 2.25 meters. Nie Er's statue leans forward with coat flying, his face is solemn with arms held up and gestures in beating the time. Overall, it looks like he is conducting and singing his \\"March of Volunteers\\". =Nie Er Cultural Square= Nie Er Cultural Square is located at Yuxi, Yunnan, which is composed by one lake, two line (outer traffic line & inner lake line), and four areas (recreational area, business area, exercising area & musical square area). There is a statue of Nie Er playing the violin on the top of the mountain. On the bottom of the statue, there are six words that were written by a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Lanqing, which are \\"Nie Er Musical square\\" (ËÅÇËÄ≥Èü≥‰πêÂπøÂú∫) in Chinese. When you are looking the square from a bird's eye view, the design of the square looks like a big violin that is lying on the earth. The view is magnificent and beautiful. There are more and more people who would like to come and stop by for a while. =Nie Er Square in Japan= In 1981, Fujisawa, Japan, under the socialist mayor Shun Hayama (ËëâÂ±±Â≥ª), and Kunming became sister cities. Nie Er Square was established in Shonan Beach Park (ÊπòÂçóÊµ∑Â≤∏ÂÖ¨Âúí), near the beach where he had died.Nie Er Memorial (Fujisawa City home page) (in Japanese) Gallery: File:Nie Er Tomb Kunming 2009 07.jpgNei Er's Tomb, with his statue, in Xishan Forest Park (Ë•øÂ±±Ê£ÆÊûóÂÖ¨Âúí) beside Dian Lake, Kunming File:Nie Er Tomb.jpgNie Er's Tomb in Kunming, ChinaNie Er's Tomb (ËÅ∂ËÄ≥Â¢ì) File:Nie Er Memorial Square in Japan.jpgNie Er Memorial Square in Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan File:Nie Er Cenotaph.JPGNie Er Memorial in Nie Er Memorial Square  Quotes  *Zhou Enlai (first premier of China): \\"Many youngsters were going to the revolution by singing songs of Xian Xinghai and Nie Er. They are the great musicians.\\" *Zhu De (Chinese general): \\"He is people's musician.\\" *Guo Moruo (writer): \\"Nie Er, the horn of Chinese revolution, the drum of People's liberation, and his March of the Volunteers has already been regarded as Chinese Anthem. This song always triggers people's patriotism, and it also stir up morale with its solemnity. As well as our national flag, Nie Er is immortal.\\" *Xia Yan (playwright): \\"Though Nie Er only worked for two years in Shanghai, he still wrote tons of well-known music, which are better for promoting anti-Japanese national salvation movement. Many people are going to the war by singing these songs.\\" *Tian Han (playwright): \\"The reason Nie Er's works are proliferated so fast is due to his enthusiasm on politics. His intention for composing is not for making music, but he is standing among the miserable people to shout out his anger and request. His work tightly combines the revolutionary world view and progressive innovative method together, which is certainly the invincible for art innovation. *Xian Xinghai (composer): \\"His songs are aggressive, he wants to awaken people by using his songs. His songs are anti-imperialism, anti- feudalism, and anti-warlordism, which are landmark for China. His songs can reflect people's requests, so that can be accepted and sang by millions people. He is the founder of Chinese new music. Many people say that he still need more professional cultivation on musical skills, which is not right. From his hard-working and achievements, I can say that he has already exceeded many so-called \\"master musician\\" and \\" professional composer\\". Because of his modesty, he has already surpassed many nominal 'musicians'.\\" *He L√ºting (composer): \\"Nie Er passed away so young is a big lose for Chinese musical field. However, his contributions for civil revolution is significant, which are pride for Chinese musical field.

RADARSAT-2 was previously assembled, integrated and tested at the David Florida Laboratory near Ottawa, Ontario before the start of its launch campaign. The end of the spacecraft and ground segment commissioning period was declared on April 27, 2008 after which routine commercial operation started. The satellite has a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with multiple polarization modes, including a fully polarimetric mode in which HH, HV, VV and VH polarized data are acquired. Its highest resolution is 1 m in Spotlight mode (3 m in Ultra Fine mode). In ScanSAR Wide Beam mode the SAR has a nominal swath width of 500 km and an imaging resolution of 100 m. Its left looking capability allows the spacecraft the unique capability to image the Antarctic on a routine basis providing data in support of scientific research. The prime contractor on the project is MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates (MDA), who have previously built projects such as the Canadarm. Other collaborating companies included EMS Technologies and Alenia. EMS Space & Technology/Montreal division was bought by MDA in 2005. RADARSAT-2 is owned and operated by MDA. RADARSAT-2 is a follow-on to RADARSAT-1 which mission terminated in April 2013. It has the same orbit (798 km altitude sun-synchronous orbit with 6 p.m. ascending node and 6 a.m. descending node). Some of the orbit characteristics are 24 days repeat cycle (=343 orbits), 14.29 orbits per day, each orbit being 100.75 minutes duration. It is filling a wide variety of application, including sea ice mapping and ship routing, iceberg detection, agricultural crop monitoring, marine surveillance for ship and pollution detection, terrestrial defence surveillance and target identification, geological mapping, mine monitoring, land use mapping, wetlands mapping, topographic mapping. On 4 July 2009, Canada's Department of National Defence announced their intention to increase RADARSAT-2 usage for surveillance of Canada's coastlines and the Arctic. To carry out this new project, the satellite's owner MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) of Richmond, B.C., was awarded $25-million contract to carry out upgrades (called project Polar Epsilon) to enhance the satellites capabilities to detect surface ships. The upgrades consisted of creating new beam mode (OSVN and DVWF) that target improvements in maritime vessels detection over a broad area, as well as upgrading the RADARSAT-2 ground segment to improve conflict resolution with other government users. Two new ground stations for the data reception have been built, one on the east coast at Masstown, N.S., and the other at Aldergrove, B.C. (west coast). These two new stations are mainly used for the Polar Epsilon project. By mid-August 2015, the addition of the Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation (CCMEO) X Band receiving station in Inuvik has significantly increased RADARSAT-2 downlink capacity in Canada. The network of ground receiving station continues to expand with 19 partners organization using 53 antennas at various reception sites (as of Jun 2020). As of January 2020, RADARSAT-2 is entering its 12th operational service year. Numerous enhancements have been added to the original capabilities both on the ground and on the space segments. The operational performance is well within the specification with an acquisition success rate above 97% (Acquisition successfully executed Vs Acquisition loaded on the Spacecraft for execution) and a percentage of availability of 99.95% (hours of outage Vs total hours in a year). The usage of SAR data have been steadily growing from an average of 3.5 minutes per orbit in 2008 to an average of 11.57 minutes per orbit in 2019. On July 15, 2020, MDA has provided the full extend of the original Government of Canada data allocation in exchange for the government‚Äôs financial contribution to the building of the satellite. The Government of Canada remains an important user of RADARSAT-2 data.

McGuinness created Twisted Kaiju Theater when inspired by a humorous photo comic-strip appearing in ToyFare called Twisted Toyfare Theater (in which TKT has been mentioned twice over the yearsArticle in the March 2002 issue of Toyfare MagazineMcGuinness' letter in issue #97 of Toyfare Magazine). Similar in concept, McGuinness poses and photographs figurines in his personal vinyl/action figure collection (most of which consist of Godzilla-based kaiju) in bizarre situations with added dialogue bubbles. As one of the first and longest running photocomics ever produced, Twisted Kaiju Theater updates twice a week (with a frequent bonus updates), and has over 1,700 episodes. It is a BuzzComix Hall of Famer, achieving the number one position three months in a row, and has maintained a steady position in the top 10 of Top Web Comics for several years. Sean McGuinness has also been a guest of honor at I-CON in 2006 and 2007. In January 2007 and January 2008, Twisted Kaiju Theater was nominated for Outstanding Photographic Comic in the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards.2007 Web Cartoonist's Choice Award Nominations On August 11, 2013, thirteen years to the day when the site opened, the site was updated with a message from McGuinness stating that the series was, for now, ending so he could focus on his artwork as That Godzilla Guy. He did mention the possibility of a future revival. The series closed with eight strips released simultaneously. Style The art of TKT is done by juxtaposing digital photographs of vinyl/action figures (mostly kaiju) into backgrounds (primarily generated from photos) and photoshopping various effects. This style has alternately been called photocollage, photocomics or fumetti, and McGuinness shares these art techniques with \\"tutorials\\" on web photographyDigital Image Editing Tutorials and specific comic effects. Webcomics which utilize this style or similar techniques include Alien Loves Predator, Insecticomics, Perils of the Bold, and Nukeland Cinema. When the comic began, figures were posed against props and backgrounds, with word balloons added after photos were taken. As the comic progressed, more advanced techniques were used to improve the quality of the comic. The figures are now shot against a white background, then superimposed with Bluescreen technology over a different background such as a sprawling cityscape. Special effects like Dutch angles, explosions, motion blurs, and Wild Takes have also been added to give a more cinematic and dramatic look. While many of the figures are articulated, McGuinness must use photoshop techniques in order to bring many of the characters to life, such as the figurines for Shin-Goji and the Toxic Pirates, which have no articulation at all. Plot The webcomic is set in the fictional land mass known as Neo- Monster Island, populated by the various types of kaiju, mecha, bionicle, comic book and anime characters. The main cast consists of Godzilla and his friends the Toxic Pirates, who are loosely based on Sean McGuinness and his personal circle of friends, all portrayed by Super deformed (SD for short) figurines of Godzilla monsters. The remaining characters stem from a seemingly endless cast of figurines within McGuinness' collection, who make brief or recurring appearances. The first few seasons revolved around random running gags and toilet humor, the most famous of which revolved around the source of lemon sours received in packaged figurine boxes, which are nothing more than the feces of King Ghidorah.The first comic \\"Lemon Sours\\" As the comic progressed, longer and more provoking storylines took place, such as Legend of the Dark Mask, Epic and Legends. Most of the time the plots are vehicles to deliver political, social, racial or religious satire while involving one or two fight scenes. Storylines included countless invasions (such as a takeover by Yahoo!), a quest to reshoot a lost episode, and even a journey into Shin- Goji's urinary tract to destroy his kidney stones akin to Fantastic Voyage. Due to TKT godzilla being inspired by Sean McGuinness, real life events which occur are sometimes reenacted in TKT, even having one of the characters being shown as the creator of Twisted Kaiju Theater, breaking the fourth wall. Comics such as these range from many different topics, such as playing video gamesGrand Theft Auto replaced in \\"Rumble Pack I\\" or visiting comic conventions.Shin-Goji at Neko-con in \\"Neko-Con 2004 V\\" On April 24, 2009, a notice went up claiming that Twisted Kaiju Theater's website Neomonsterisland.com was under new ownership, and that the series was apparently coming to an end, though there is a listing for an April 27 update on the site at which time the new management claims it will explain what the change in ownership for the website will entail, both for the website and for TKT. The 1500th update to the series depicted a mock-image complete with non- working hypertext links of a 'page not found' page that often comes up when a website has ceased operations. A short time later, the website was updated, changing its name to 'Once and Future' and then shortly thereafter to 'The Once and Future Tyrant'. This turned out to be the latest in a series of epic storylines featured in the webcomic, intended to reintroduce the character of Tyrant, a recurring villain who had first appeared in the strip as the president of Yahoo!, who had returned and hatched an elaborate plan to take control of the island for himself, a recurring mission for the character. In this storyline, it was revealed that Tyrant is actually the elder brother of Shin-Goji, who had once ruled the island, but when their mother the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu asked him to help end the 'War of the Monsters' and he refused, she set events in motion so that Shin would break away from Tyrant (whom she saw Shin as being too dependent upon) and become the leader of the island. She had expected Tyrant to understand. He did not. Instead, he lost his mind, apparently forgetting his true powers, and went on to become a supposed homosexual individual and later the president of Yahoo! He still harbored a desire to reclaim his birthright even in this insane state, which resulted in his numerous attempts to reclaim the island only to be rebuffed by Shin-Goji and the Toxic Pirates numerous times. The storyline revealed that a previous epic storyline entitled Final Invasion was set up by Tyrant in order to distract Shin from realizing that Tyrant had managed to con him into essentially signing away the rights to the island by slipping in a falsified service provider document. Tyrant was revealed as Shin's elder brother and forced Shin to relinquish control of Neo Monster Island to Tyrant. As a direct result of the supposed 'change in management', the website itself became part of the storyline, allowing it to break the fourth wall. Many fans were at first fooled by the events, while others- namely those on the online forums for the webcomic- were quick to point out that Sean McGuinness, the creator of the series, was still named on the website as the owner of the website and its copyrights. Tyrant's plan was revealed to be twofold in its goals. Firstly he would regain what he saw as his birthright, and secondly to humble Shin, briefly exiling him from the island. Tyrant and Shin have since reconciled- for the moment at least- and went on a rescue mission to save the Toxic Pirates, who had gone missing during the storyline. The strip has once again taken on the name Twisted Kaiju Theater, with Shin once again taking a starring role. Characters =Toxic Pirates= ;Shin-Goji: Small, loud, opinionated, vulgar, and more often than not insensitive and politically incorrect, Shin-Goji somehow leads the uncharted land mass known as Neo- Monster Island. The webcomic focuses mostly on his antics and the trouble he gets himself into. He works at a popular copy and shipping shop. Shin-Goji spent much of the last year absent from the strip except for flashbacks, has only recently returned to the series as a regular character. He has been replaced as the leader of Neo-Monster Island by Tyrant, who was recently revealed to be, in addition to a recurring villain, Shin-Goji's older brother. The two have since reconciled, though Tyrant has stated that if Shin still needs a 'rival' that he is more than willing to fulfill the role of being his 'Resident Evil'.The Return II :The figure used is an SD Heisei Godzilla from the Super Collection set, and is also a representation of the author, McGuinness, inserting himself into the comic. Shin-Goji is of Irish descent because McGuinness also is. He does not make an appearance until the second season.Club Tokyo Shin-Goji means, literally translated, \\"True Godzilla\\". McGuinness chose the name Goji, which is an affectionate, shortened name for Godzilla. The Shin part came from his love of the Street Fighter character Shin-Akuma. ;Space Hojo: Space Hojo is Shin-Goji's long suffering roommate who does not show up until Season 3.Giant Sequels Attack! Space Hojo prefers trickery and common sense to keep himself free from the chaos that surrounds him and is usually the result of Shin-Goji's foolishness. Due to a botched Lasik surgery, he was endowed with the ability to shoot laser beams from his eyes. In one of the longer story lines he reveals that he is Nyarlathotep from the H.P.Lovecraft novels. In the same storyline, he claims Cthulhu is his high priest, although in the Mythos Cthulhu was the high priest of Yog-Sothoth. :Space Hojo is characterized by an SD Space Godzilla figure due to its angry and disgruntled look, a trait McGuinness associates with Howard Williams, McGuinness' real life roommate whom Space Hojo is based on. As a result of Williams being African American and being represented by a Space Godzilla figure, the running theme is all Space Godzillas represent black people. Williams has a heavy influence into the development of the comic and many of the controversial strips involving race or racism have been co-written by Williams.Darkness! ;Grendel: Grendel is a friend of Shin-Goji and Space Hojo, he shows up around the end of Season 4.Grendel's debut A member of the Stormtrooper 501st, he is only seen in his traditional armor and helmet. He serves as a bigger lecher than any of the other Toxic Pirates. As ex-military with a love of firepower, he associates with C-Ball very well. :The figure that represents him is an SD 1984 Godzilla from the Soushingeki set. The head was cut off and replaced with that of a Lego stormtrooper helmet along with armor. The model was created by real life Grendel, who also helps with some other custom figures, including the more recent Steel Pyramid. ;MOGUERA Marius: MOGUERA Marius was originally represented by a High Grade MOGUERA figure in Season 4.Online Survey Part 4 To fit in with the short, super- deformed style of the other Toxic Pirates, he was later associated with an SD MOGUERA from the Soshingeki Collection. :Also a long-suffering victim of Shin- Goji's foolishness, he buries himself in his Taekwondo model painting. His speech is most often reminiscent of Twikki from Buck Rodgers. ;C-Ball Sleazeball: C-Ball shows up in Season 6,The Twisted Kaiju and is the only married Toxic Pirate. He is the most sarcastic and dangerous of the Toxic Pirates. :He is represented by an SD Hedorah from the Soshingeki set (Though he has said he would rather be represented by a \\"chainsaw doggie\\"). Sometimes paranoid, and as a gun-nut, he gets along quite well with Grendel. His name comes from a nickname carried by the real-life C-Ball. :C-Ball has been documented as being able to secrete his own super glue (As mentioned in Epic IX). This ability came into play when C-Ball had to build Mazinger-Z for Shin. C-Ball was placed into a Robotech Valkyrie figure in battloid mode when his original body was destroyed. It acts much like a life support system for him. ;Spidersense: Spidersense is called The Spirit Warrior, a God-loving man who rocks hard to Dokken. An oddity on the sometimes blasphemous island of Twisted Kaiju Theater, watching over Shin-Goji and the others and making sure they don't stray too far. He also plays HeroClix with the Toxic Pirate crew. His figure is a painted in the colors of Spider-Man. ;Thor: Thor is the resident manga artist of Neo-Monster Island, having a \\"special\\" store of rare artist's ink. Described as \\"The Manga Fanboy\\", the character of Thor is represented by a personified (Custom Virus SD),Thor's debut and the butt of many jokes involving the origins of his ink. Thor's daughter makes an appearance as the same but smaller figurine. As a real life artist with published works in Antarctic Press and Radio Comix, Thor helped Twisted Kaiju Theater see actual publication. ;Son Goharotto: Son Goharotto (Son Go-san for short) is the creator of Saikyo Powaa, and is a moderator of the forums in Twisted Kaiju Theater. He is most remembered for his renditions of half-naked anthropomorphic babes and his temper. He fought Shin-Goji to a stand still when his \\"Vengeance Seal\\" was activated.Shin Versus Son! The Seal of Vengeance Breaks! ;Big Will: Big Will is a Toxic Pirate who joined the team during a time when Space Hojo was not present as a replacement. Despite Space Hojo's return in the strip he has not been removed from the team and is still a member. Apparently he has tried to commit suicide every time Shin accepts fan comics for \\"fan week\\". He is portrayed with an SD Destroyah figure. The Kaiju Girls The Kaiju GirlsKaiju Girls (also known as K-Girls) are a gallery of females anthropomorphized after the various Toho kaiju. As opposed to some art sites where females are put into Godzilla costumes, McGuinness was the first to commission anthro art of Godzilla costumes. They started when McGuinness wanted to create a poster girl for the site, which was heavily male dominated. Anthro artist Danny Valentini drew the first girl using specifications from McGuinness. G.I.N.A. (Godzilla Inspired Naked Anthromorph, name by MOGUERA Marius) was drawn reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe's Playboy cover, based on the Godzilla 2000 suit. Soon after each Toho Godzilla monster was envisioned as a Kaiju Girl. There are now 75 or so Kaiju Girls including original creations and girls based on characters like Great Mazinger the more recent Cloverfield monster, as well as other genres, gathered from a series of different artists either by gift art or commission. The galleries are split up into the specific eras of Godzilla movies, as well as original creations, group shots and sprite based art. The galleries range from Rated G to NC-17 for adult situations and nudity. The Kaiju Girls have been drawn into a few TKT episodes, and models were created by NToonz for other episodes. But when it comes to overall \\"continuity\\", any comics which depict them are not considered canon. There are a few fanfics dedicated to the Kaiju Girls ‚Äî McGuinness ultimately decides if each is to be considered \\"official\\" to the overall mythos of the kaiju girls or not. The site draws some controversy for the Kaiju Girls because of the unregulated adult situations, and from people who find the \\"furry\\" genre distasteful. After a conflict with some of the artists who submitted work to his site as gift art, he required all artists to include a disclaimer stating all fanworks sent to Neo-Monster Island/Twisted Kaiju Theater would be regarded as gifts unless otherwise specified, and K-Girls and other such characters would remain the intellectual property of their respective creators. Legal ownership of actual images is given to Shin- Goji/Sean McGuinness with the provision the creators would be consulted in the event of use beyond showcasing. Fanworks submitted by the artists and authors are treated with utmost care and respect, and in return the creators agree they no longer possess sole interest in the managing of their creations. Artists have started donating Kaiju Girl artwork more rapidly than McGuinness can upload to the site, to the point where Wednesdays are usually devoted to updating and cleaning up the Kaiju Girl archives. On May 18, 2009, The Kaiju Girls have been removed from the primary website of Twisted Kaiju Theater, and have their own website devoted entirely to them, called DaiKaiju Academy. As of July 7, 2011, the Kaiju Girls have been removed from the site in their entirety, each character now being maintained solely by their original creators. Archive CDs McGuinness sold archive CDs of his work at cost. Volume I contained the first 500 episodes, two CD exclusive cartoons, an exclusive G.I.N.A. picture by manga artist Thor Thorvaldson, and the complete Kaiju Girl archive as of March 17, 2006. Volume II was released in March 2007, and also featured exclusive comics and Kaiju Girl artwork. These CD have since been discontinued and are no longer offered.

He left for Paris in 1883, and attended the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe, then took classes (without being a registered student) at the √âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es (1884‚Äì1889). BrƒÉtianu received an engineer's diploma, but not a licence to practice. In 1889, he returned to the country and was assigned orders by the Army, being promoted to Lieutenant. Later in that year, he joined the Romanian Railways as an engineer, working under the leadership of Anghel Saligny. =Early politics= He became a member of the PNL in 1895, the same year he ran in elections and was elected to the Parliament of Romania by the Ist College (of the landed gentry) in Gorj County. In early 1899, he was in the majority that voted in favor of the entry of former members of the Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party into the PNL. He served as Minister of Public Works (31 March 1897-March 30, 1899; 14 February 1901-July 18, 1902) and Minister of the Interior (12 March 1907-December 27, 1908) - the latter assignment was prompted by the effects of the 1907 Peasants' Revolt. In 1909, he was elected head of the National Liberals, a position he was to hold until his death; he first became Prime Minister in January 1909, and kept the office until 28 December 1910. BrƒÉtianu's policies moved the PNL towards an acceptance of land reform, but deliberations over the project continued until after World War I, with BrƒÉtianu himself showing reserves over projects that aimed to replace the 1866 Constitution of Romania with a fully democratic one. In 1913, he convinced his party to accept a moderate version of land reform, as well as the creation of a single electoral college - a measure which would have given more accurate representation to the peasant majority. Over the following months, these policies were approved on principle by King Carol I, and even by the Conservative Party. =World War I= Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu The outbreak of the world conflict in 1914 brought a major polemic in Romanian society. The Conservatives oscillated between a neutral stance and participation alongside the Central Powers (to which Romania had committed itself); instead, the PNL called for an alignment with the Entente Forces. Despite the fact that BrƒÉtianu was again Prime Minister from 16 January 1914 to 9 February 1918, his policies in this respect were procrastinated. Initially, a decision on the matter was blocked by King Carol, until his death in September 1914. Afterwards, with the ascension of Ferdinand I (who was to remain a political ally of BrƒÉtianu for the rest of his life), the government started secret negotiations with the Entente, meant to condition Romania's participation with the granting of Austro-Hungarian lands with a majority Romanian population. In August 1916, Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary. Minor advances into Transylvania were met with a Central Powers counter- offensive that swept through Oltenia and Wallachia, occupied Bucharest, and forced all governmental structures to take refuge in Ia≈üi. While Moldavia remained the only region under Romanian administration and the country increased its reliance on Imperial Russia - and then on the Russian Provisional Government, the Romanian Army was able to block further Central Powers' offensives in the battles of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti, and Oituz. This situation was ended by the October Revolution in Russia and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Bolshevik government and the Central Powers: Romania saw itself without reinforcements, agreed to an armistice, and then signed the Treaty of Bucharest in May 1918. In the meantime, BrƒÉtianu's had been replaced with the crisis government of General Alexandru Averescu, and this was soon followed by Alexandru Marghiloman's (chosen to negotiate the peace, as the German Empire was thought to be friendly towards Marghiloman). Nonetheless, Romania never did ratify the signed treaty, and denounced it in October 1918, immediately re-entering the conflict on the Entente's side. In November, the Compi√®gne armistice with Germany removed all legal value of the Bucharest Treaty. =Third cabinet and support for Averescu= The spectre of socialist agitation, which had led to incidents such as a major strike action in Bucharest in December 1918, brought about the fall of the Constantin CoandƒÉ cabinet, and BrƒÉtianu again occupied the position. He led the Romanian delegation to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, where he was a vocal supporter of the union with Transylvania and Bukovina. Although ultimately Romania received most territories it claimed, he resigned in 1919 since he would not accept a compromise on the disputed territories in Banat that had become part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. However, Romania had registered other successes - notably, Russia's exit from the war had led to the union with Bessarabia (the Moldavian Democratic Republic). Soon, the PNL found itself threatened by the political realities of a Greater Romania. The policy of alliances of the Romanian National Party (a mainly Transylvanian group) had brought the rapid formation of the cabinet of Alexandru Vaida-Voevod in December 1919; this cabinet, and especially its Peasants' Party group, supported a radical version of the land reform, leading to endless debates in parliament. At the same time, the People's Party, a new and strong populist movement under General Averescu, had begun a campaign for both an urgent land reform and for bringing about the prosecution of PNL politicians as agents of the economic hardships. Faced with a choice, BrƒÉtianu approached Averescu and offered PNL support for a People's Party cabinet in return for moderation. =Fourth and fifth cabinet= BrƒÉtianu's final cabinet upon being sworn in The PNL retreated its backing after finding a more convenient option in a Take Ionescu-led cabinet, and BrƒÉtianu became Prime Minister again from 17 January 1922 to 30 March 1926. The fourth BrƒÉtianu cabinet adopted the Constitution of 1923, a document which confirmed universal male suffrage and minority rights as first defined by the laws of 1918; because of the highly centralised model it favored, it drew suspicion from the Transylvanian politicians that it served the goal of a National Liberal-dominated Old Kingdom (especially after the constitution was approved of through a simple vote in Parliament). At the same time, the PNL cabinet began carrying out a national-level land reform. As the elections of 1926 confirmed the rise of the National Peasants' Party (created as the union of the Romanian National and Peasants' parties), King Ferdinand again called on Averescu to form the government. By that moment, the general was thought by the PNL to be a convenient agent of its own policies, but Averescu's negotiations for a return of the disinherited Prince Carol after his father's imminent death made BrƒÉtianu switch his support to a broad coalition government under Barbu ≈ûtirbey. On 21 June 1927, BrƒÉtianu returned with his fifth and final cabinet. He died in Bucharest, from complications of laryngitis, and was replaced as Prime Minister by his brother VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu until the calling of elections. External links * Ion I.C.

Plot Four teen girls in Manhattan‚ÄîGalleria, Chanel, Aqua, and Dorinda‚Äîperform at a children's birthday party as The Cheetah Girls. After the performance, Chanel rushes home to tell her mother about the show, but her mother is preoccupied preparing for a date with her new Parisian boyfriend to pay attention. Galleria comes home to her parents, who chastise her for not taking phone messages for her mother or walking their Bichon Frise dog, Toto. Meanwhile, Dorinda attends to her job, doing janitorial work at a community center. The girls hope to become the first freshmen to win the talent show in their school's history. After a successful audition for the talent show, a famous alumnus of the school, Jackal Johnson, expresses interest in signing The Cheetah Girls to his record label. Galleria introduces herself as the founder and songwriter of The Cheetah Girls, which is not appreciated by the group's other members. While Galleria's mother, Dorothea, is initially hesitant to let The Cheetah Girls pursue the opportunity with Jackal, she eventually allows the girls to have a meeting after being encouraged by Galleria's father. The meeting is a success, and despite some ongoing concerns from Galleria, the girls begin to prepare to record their first song. Without asking the group's other members for opinions, Galleria suggests that The Cheetah Girls should not make time for the talent show due to their record deal, and criticizes Dorinda for repeatedly wearing the same dull clothing. Aqua encourages Chanel, Galleria's oldest friend, to speak to Galleria about her behavior. Meanwhile, Dorinda has the opportunity to take a dance audition at the center where she is employed. She is offered a paying role because of her work, but taking on the role would require her to leave the Cheetah Girls. Later, Chanel becomes distressed after overhearing a voicemail suggesting that her mother was planning to sell their New York City apartment to move to Paris with her boyfriend. Feeling neglected, Chanel takes advantage of having her mother's credit card to go on a shopping spree on Madison Avenue. In an act of kindness, Chanel purchases a cheetah jacket for Dorinda who reveals her financial troubles: She is a poor foster child who lives in a 10-child household with a mother whose husband is a superintendent for the building. Chanel assures Dorinda that they will remain friends and she will always be a Cheetah Girl. At the next meeting between The Cheetah Girls and Jackal Johnson, Jackal reveals that a marketing team has developed a new image for the group that will require them to wear masks and lip sync. Galleria is devastated by this and declares that the group refuse the offer, but the other girls stay behind due to their frustrations with Galleria's attitude. Galleria leaves under the impression that the other Cheetah Girls have taken the deal. Chanel arrives home where her mother reveals her credit card was declined due to Chanel's shopping spree. Chanel breaks down after thinking about how grateful she is for her mother given Dorinda's current status as a foster child, and Chanel's mother agrees to make more time for her daughter. Later, Galleria's dog Toto falls into an obstruction on the Manhattan streets. This attracts a great deal of attention, including a live news story, which alerts all four Cheetah Girls members about what is going on and causes them to come to Toto's rescue. Their singing helps calm Toto down and allow for his safe removal from the obstruction. This act of bonding ultimately causes the girls to repair their friendship, and they go on to sing a new song on the news for all of New York to see. Jackal Johnson calls, voicing his regret trying to change The Cheetah Girl, but the girls refuse an offer with him. The Cheetah Girls end up winning the talent show, and the girls renew their commitment to achieving their dreams and maintaining their friendship.

The Swiss National Science Foundation was established under private law by physicist and medical doctor Alexander von Muralt in 1952.  Organisation  The SNSF consists of three main bodies: Foundation Council, National Research Council and Administrative Offices. The Foundation Council is the highest authority and makes strategic decisions. The National Research Council is composed of distinguished researchers who mostly work at Swiss institutions of higher education. They assess research proposals submitted to the SNSF and make funding decisions. The National Research Council comprises up to 100 members and is subdivided into four divisions: * Division I: humanities and social sciences * Division II: mathematics, natural sciences and engineering sciences * Division III: biology and medicine * Division IV: programmes (National Research Programmes and National Centres of Competence in Research) The divisions work together with local Research Commissions, which are based at institutions of higher education. These commissions act as a link to the SNSF and they offer a local perspective on applications emanating from their institution. The administrative offices support and coordinate the activities of the Foundation Council, the Research Council and the Research Commissions. Their tasks include financial controlling of research funding, requesting and evaluating external reviews of proposed projects, maintaining national and international contacts in the area of research policy, representing the SNSF in relevant bodies and communicating with the public. The administrative offices are located in Bern. In 2016, Angelika Kalt was appointed Director of the SNSF.  Funding schemes  Mandated by the federal authorities, the Swiss National Science Foundation supports basic science in all academic disciplines. It evaluates research proposals submitted by researchers and funds projects selected on the basis of scientific criteria. The SNSF provides fundings for research projectsProjects funding of the SNSF . and for research career,Career funding of the SNSF . among which fellowships, SNSF professorships and Marie Heim-V√∂gtlin grants (programme for the promotion of women in research). By awarding fellowships and special grants, the SNSF also supports young researchers.

Research Programmes and Centres of Competence in Research  The National Research Programmes (NRP) and National Centres of Competence in Research (NCCR) are the most important research programmes of the SNSF. Mandated by the Federal Council, NRPs generate scientific knowledge aimed at solving pressing problems. They generally run for up to five years and have an overall budget of eight to twelve million Swiss francs. Since 1975, the SNSF has launched over 69 NRPs. NCCRs aim to strengthen research structures in Switzerland. Each NCCR is based at an institution of higher education and consists of a centre of competence as well as a national and international network. NCCRs benefit from SNSF funding of 20 to 60 million Swiss francs over a period of ten to twelve years, as well as university and third party funding. = National Centres of Competence in Research (NCCR) = Completed:Current NCCRs * NCCR Finrisk. * NCCR (IM)2 - National Centres of Competence in Research Interactive Multimodal Information Management. * NCCR COME * NCCR MICS * NCCR Molecular oncology * NCCR Genetics * NCCR Structural biology * NCCR Neuro * NCCR Quantum photonics * NCCR Nanoscale science - Swiss Nanoscience Institute. * NCCR MaNEP - National Centres of Competence in Research Material with Novel Electronic Properties. * NCCR North-South * NCCR Plant Survival * NCCR Climate * NCCR Sesam Ongoing:Current NCCRs website * National Centres of Competence in Research Trade Regulation - comprises 12 trade-related IP topics, seeks to aid regulators in promoting coherence within a fragmented system of international trade regulations, and is directed by Manfred Elsig, of the University of Bern.The NCCR Trade Regulation website * NCCR Affective Sciences * NCCR Chemical Biology * NCCR Democracy * NCCR Iconic Criticism * NCCR Kidney.CH * NCCR LIVES * NCCR Mediality * NCCR MUST * NCCR QSIT * NCCR Robotics * NCCR SYNAPSY * NCCR Trade Regulation * NCCR TransCure * NCCR Bio-Inspired Materials * NCCR Digital Fabrication * NCCR MARVEL * NCCR MSE * NCCR On the Move * NCCR PlanetS * NCCR RNA & Disease * NCCR SwissMAP  Research magazine Horizons  The research magazine Horizons (German title: Horizonte, French title: Horizons) is a joint publication of the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences (it was edited by the SNSF alone before 2012).Research magazine Horizons, www.snf.ch (page visited on 8 March 2014).

It is used as a substitute for cooking with wood smoke while retaining a similar flavor. It can be used to flavor any meat or vegetable. It is generally made by condensing the smoke from wood, but can contain any number of food additives.  History  Pyrolysis or thermal decomposition of wood in a low oxygen manner originated prehistorically to produce charcoal. Condensates of the vapors eventually were made and found useful as preservatives. For centuries, water-based condensates of wood smoke were popularly called \\"wood vinegar\\", presumably due to its utilization as food vinegar. Pliny the Elder recorded in one of his ten volumes of Natural History the use of wood vinegar as an embalming agent, declaring it superior to other treatments he used. In 1658, Johann Rudolf Glauber outlined the methods to produce wood vinegar during charcoal making. Further, he described the use of the water insoluble tar fraction as a wood preservative and documented the freezing of the wood vinegar to concentrate it. Use of the French derivation, pyroligneous acid, as a widely used term for wood vinegar emerged by 1788. In the United States, in 1895, E. H. Wright inaugurated the era of commercial distribution of pyroligneous acid under a new name, liquid smoke. Among Wright's innovations were the standardization of the product, marketing and distribution. Wright's Liquid Smoke and its modern-day successors have always been the subject of controversy about their contents and production, but in 1913, Wright prevailed in a federal misbranding case. Case judge Van Valkenburg wrote: Historically, all pyroligneous acid products, Wright's product and many other condensates have been made as byproducts of charcoal manufacturing, which was of greater value. Chemicals such as methanol, acetic acid and acetone have been isolated from these condensates and sold. With the advent of lower cost fossil fuel sources, today these and other wood derived chemicals retain only small niches. In 1959 the era of modern condensed smoke based products began with the establishment of Red Arrow Products Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The important distinction marking this era from the past is the production of modern condensates to be used industrially as a replacement for smoking food directly with non- condensed smoke. Today there are many manufacturing locations around the world, most of which pyrolyze wood primarily to generate condensates which are further processed to make hundreds of derivative products. These are now referred to less as liquid smoke products, and instead as smoke flavorings, smoke flavors, and natural condensed smoke.  Production  The condensed products from the destructive distillation of wood are called \\"liquid smoke\\" or \\"pyroligneous acid\\". There are no standards of identity, prescribed production methods, or tests which distinguish between liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid; they can be considered to be the same. However, the numerous variables that are manipulated during pyrolysis do lead to a wide range of compositions of the condensates. In addition, implementation of many further processing steps by concentration, dilution, distillation, extraction, and use of food additives has led to the many hundreds of unique products on the market worldwide. Wood, particularly hardwood, is by far the most widely used biomass pyrolyzed to make liquid smoke. Commercial products are made using both batch and continuous methods. Commercial products are made using a range of reactors from rotary calciners, heated screws, batch charcoal kilns, to fast pyrolysis reactors. The process type and conditions of processing lead to greater variances between the condensates than the differences between the common wood types that are in use. Variables such as feed rate, vapor residence time, particle size, oxygen infiltration, and temperature can have substantial effects on yield and composition of the condensates. Wide ranges of chemical composition are reported throughout the literature and unless the process and conditions are cited, there is limited utility of such results. Commercial manufacturers strive to control their manufacturing variables in order to standardize product compositions. Water is added either during condensation or after to cause separation of three fractions. Once water is added, the aqueous phase becomes the largest and most useful fraction. It contains wood derived chemical compounds of higher chemical polarity such as those found in carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and phenol chemical classes. Many compounds together are responsible for the flavor, browning, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects of smoke and liquid smoke. The smallest condensed fraction is the lowest-polarity upper phase which a mix of phytosterols and other oily, waxy substances. The lower phase is commonly referred to as tar. It is an intermediate-polarity mixture of phenolic polymers, secondary and tertiary reaction products, some of the water-soluble polar compounds partitioned in the amount of which is governed by individual partition coefficients, water and the bulk of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Wood tar has been used as a preservative, water repellent, and antiseptic. Tar from birch was produced as a commodity product on large scale in northern Europe. Today commercial liquid smoke products are still prepared from this phase. Liquid smoke condensates are made commercially for the global meat industry in the U.S. and Europe and are regulated by those governments. Liquid smoke is still referenced as wood vinegar and is being made and used indigenously in many other locations such as Japan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, and Southeast Asia.  Use  = Food = The application of liquid smoke to food has grown to encompass a wide variety of methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. By far the widest use of liquid smoke is for the purpose of replacing direct smoking of food with onsite-generated smoke from wood. To impart the desired functional effects of smoke, liquid smoke preparations must be applied topically. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are the functionalities that can only be obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing liquid smoke followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright's liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization. It remains the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved and direct applications of solutions of liquid smoke via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines have grown to be the largest type of application method. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of liquid smoke for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Also noteworthy is the method of topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings. Meat products are subsequently stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another important means of imparting smoke flavor. It is used when other technical functions of smoke are not imperative to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods or injecting whole muscle meat. Incorporation into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings and compounding with other flavors are other important ways in which the flavors are used. Further utility of aqueous smoke solutions is gained by the use of more complex food-grade processing such as extraction into oil, spray drying using maltodextrin carriers, or plating onto foods and food ingredients such as malt flour, yeast, or salt. = Non-food = Extensive references to beneficial uses of pyroligneous acid in plants for seed germination, pest control, microbial control, plant structural enhancements are reported. Livestock benefits such as antimicrobial preservation of feed, nutrient digestibility,, and other claims are found. Scientific agricultural studies can be found in peer reviewed journals, but many agricultural benefits such as soil quality improvement, better seed germination, and healthier foliage are widely promoted without attribution. Broad claims of medical benefits to humans in digestive ailments, dental infections, liver, heart, skin ailments, ears, eyes are found, but the literature is devoid of accepted scientific studies for such testimonial claims in humans.  Safety  The first government-sanctioned assessment of liquid smoke was undertaken by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 1981, the committee commissioned by FDA to evaluate information on the products concluded there was no evidence demonstrating the products were a hazard to the public the way they were being used. Today, these products stand as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in the United States and may be used at levels necessary to produce the intended technical effects. Manufacturing plants where liquid smoke is made are regulated and inspected by the FDA. The European Union established procedures for the safety assessment and the authorization of smoke flavorings used or intended for use in or on foods in 2003. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was charged with evaluating information on primary condensate smoke flavorings. Information on twelve products from ten applicants were evaluated by EFSA. Opinions were published on all twelve. The products considered were what each applicant considered their own primary product prior to any further processing or derivatization. All twelve products were determined to be genotoxic positive by in vitro methods, but when evaluated by in vivo methods ten were found to not be of concern by EFSA. The AM-01 product was judged inconclusive and FF-B was considered weakly genotoxic. Based upon the NOAEL determinations for each product and supplemental information supplied by some manufacturers usage limits for most products have been established and are conveyed by manufacturers to users. Most of these primary products and their derivatives remain in commercial use. Only products which are the subjects of these evaluations are authorized to be used in commerce within the EU.

His most notable work, Command Decision, was published as a novel, play, and screenplay following World War II. Personal history Haines was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1908, one of three sons of Diedrich Jansen Haines and Ella Wister Haines. His father worked as vice president of a surety bond company, Southern Surety Company of Iowa, and his mother was a notable author of mysteries and serialized stories, many of which appeared in The Des Moines Register. His uncle, Owen Wister, authored the 1902 novel The Virginian, which popularized the genre of Western fiction, and later became both a successful film and television series. Haines was educated at the Scholta-Nollen School, the Culver Military Academy, and Des Moines' Theodore Roosevelt High School, from which he graduated in 1926. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1931 with a degree in engineering. Unable to find employment as an engineer during the Great Depression, he worked nights as an electric lineman on a railroad running between Chicago and the Eastern Seaboard. His experience as a lineman became the basis for his first two books, Slim and High Tension. Haines joined the United States Army Air Forces in early 1942, going to the United Kingdom as an intelligence officer with the U.S. Eighth Air Force. Haines served nearly three years in Britain, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel on the staff of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces Europe, where he worked on the Ultra Project. In 1934, Haines married Frances Tuckerman and had two children, William Jr. and Laura. Haines retired in Laguna Niguel, in Southern California and died of a stroke while on a cruise ship near Acapulco. Works Slim, published in 1934, won him critical and popular acclaim as a writer. The novel was part adventure tale, part social commentary, and part-time capsule of the Great Depression, notable for its realism and its on-target portrayal of working class attitudes and language during that period. Slim continues to have an audience today and is a sought-after book, especially among utility linemen and railfans. In 1937, the novel was made into the movie Slim starring Henry Fonda, with Haines writing the screenplay. The illustrations for the hardcover of Slim were by Robert Lawson and do not appear in the paperback releases. His next novel, High Tension (1938), was a critical success but less successful financially. His novel The Winter War (1961), about the 1877 winter campaign of the U.S. Army against the Sioux in Montana, was at the time of its publication a popular western and was awarded the Spur Award of the Western Writers of America. He also published a non-fiction book, Ultra in 1980, also based on his World War II experiences as an intelligence officer. His other books were The Honorable Rocky Slade (1955), Target (1964), and The Image (1968). His filmography credits are Alibi Ike (1935), Man of Iron (1935), Black Legion (1937), Slim (1937), Mr. Dodd Takes the Air (1937), Submarine D-1 (1937), The Texans (1938), Beyond Glory (1948), Command Decision (1948), The Racket (1951), One Minute to Zero (1952), The Eternal Sea (1955), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and Torpedo Run (1958). Haines was a member of the Authors Guild and the Dramatists Guild of America. He also contributed various articles and stories to magazines. His short story \\"Remarks-None\\" was published in the railroad story anthology Headlights and Markers in 1968. =Command Decision= While in Europe, Haines began writing a stage play, Command Decision, based on his 8th Air Force experiences, but was unable to sell it. Many producers rejected it, feeling it followed too closely the war's end to have popular appeal. A publisher suggested he write it as a novel, which first appeared as a four-part serial in The Atlantic Monthly between October 1946 and 1947. In January 1947, the first edition of Command Decision brought Haines critical and popular acclaim. The success of the novel revived the play, which ran for 409 performances on Broadway between October 1947 and September 1948. In May 1947 Haines reached a deal with MGM Studios to sell it the film rights for $100,000, with an additional promise of 15% of the play's weekly gross (or approximately $300,000) if the play opened by October 1947.TCM Notes Command Decision as a feature film starring Clark Gable premiered in December 1948. The film and book have been called the first important work of fiction about World War II. They differ from most of the prior war-themed works from that period, which stressed the experiences of average citizens forced to go to war, in that Command Decision explores the pressures of leadership, political in-fighting, moral conflicts, and psychological effects rather than glamorizing combat, and frankly admitting the high losses in men and materiel that characterized air combat. It also takes a \\"warts and all\\" approach to the conduct of some U.S. military leaders, depicting occasional propaganda misrepresentations, personal ambitions, opportunism, and information clampdowns in the name of security. The protagonist of the story is a general who must choose between submitting to public relations demands and doing what must be done to defeat Germany. He chooses the latter and is relieved of his command for it, leading to the death of his closest friend in the process.

Contents The Eberron Campaign Setting book introduces Eberron, and provides the core campaign setting, including campaign-specific rules and details on the fictional continent of Khorvaire. This book is required to use other Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Eberron products, and includes the introductory adventure \\"The Forgotten Forge\\". Publication history Eberron was created by author and game designer Keith Baker as the winning entry for Wizards of the Coast's Fantasy Setting Search, a competition run in 2002 to establish a new setting for the D&D; game. Eberron was chosen from more than 11,000 entries, and was officially released with the publication of the Eberron Campaign Setting hardback book in June 2004. Baker said that he submitted Eberron \\"just because it was a fun idea. I really didn't expect anything to come of it, but I enjoyed writing the proposal.\\" It was designed by Keith Baker, Bill Slavicsek, and James Wyatt. The cover illustration is by Wayne Reynolds, with interior illustrations by Dave Allsop, Kalman Andrasofszky, John Avon, Ted Beargeon, Beet, David Bircham, Tomm Coker, Rafa Garres, Frazer Irving, Andrew Jones, Dana Knutson, Ron Lemen, Lee Moyer, Lucio Parrillo, Martina Pilcerova, Steve Prescott, Anne Stokes, Mark Tedin, Franz Vohwinkel, Kev Walker, Sam Wood, and James Zhang. Reception The reviewer from Pyramid commented: \\"If you're one of the thousands who submitted a one-page treatment for Wizards of the Coast's world-setting competition, you may want to go ahead and skip this review. But if you're still here: Eberron, the winning entry in the $100,000 contest to select a new world for Dungeons & Dragons fans to play in, is the winner in more ways than one.\\" The Eberron Campaign Setting won the Origins Award for Best Role Playing Game Supplement of 2004. Chris Przybyszewski, for the SF Site, wrote \\"Eberron's true strength comes from its social structures and tone. As for the former, players can be a member of any number of royal or ordinary houses, as well as a number of temples. The chances for inter-house intrigue is tantalizing, as is the prospect of journeying characters from know-nothing newbies to powerful heads of the royal court. The additional pressure of international conflict adds to the game-play possibilities. [...] Eberron comes complete with a starter adventure to launch new parties, and a game master should have little problem immersing her or his party into a new world. The art of the book is excellent, as with most of the modern AD&D; (version 3.5 and later) books, and the adults of the group can only enjoy the more mature storylines\\".

Its long title is \\"An Act to remove Doubts as to the Validity of Colonial Laws\\". The purpose of the Act was to remove any apparent inconsistency between local (colonial) and British (\\"imperial\\") legislation. Thus it confirmed that colonial legislation (provided it had been passed in the proper manner) was to have full effect within the colony, limited only to the extent that it was not in contradiction with (\\"repugnant to\\") any Act of Parliament that contained powers which extended beyond the boundaries of the United Kingdom to include that colony. This had the effect of clarifying and strengthening the position of colonial legislatures, while at the same time restating their ultimate subordination to the Westminster Parliament. Until the passage of the Act, a number of colonial statutes had been struck down by local judges on the grounds of repugnancy to English laws, whether or not those English laws had been intended by Parliament to be effective in the colony. This had been a particular problem for the government in South Australia, where Justice Benjamin Boothby had struck down local statutes on numerous occasions in the colony's Supreme Court. By the mid-1920s, the British government accepted that the dominions should have full legislative autonomy. Accordingly, the imperial Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster, which repealed the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 to the dominions (i.e., Australia, Canada, the Irish Free State, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and the Union of South Africa). The Statute of Westminster took effect immediately in Canada, the Irish Free State and South Africa. Australia adopted the Statute in 1942 with the passing of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, with retroactive effect to 3 September 1939, the start of World War II. The Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 continued to have application in individual Australian states until the Australia Act 1986 came into effect in 1986. New Zealand adopted the Statute of Westminster in 1947. Newfoundland never adopted the Statute of Westminster. Instead, facing grave financial difficulties as a result of the Great Depression, Newfoundland gave up responsible government in 1934. The Colonial Laws Validity Act continued to apply to Newfoundland, which was from then on ruled by an appointed Governor and Commission of Government until, in 1949, Newfoundland joined Canada as its 10th province. Elsewhere, the Colonial Laws Validity Act remains in force, and helps to define the relationship between Acts of Parliament and laws passed in self-governing British territories, as well as the legality of decisions made by territorial legislatures and governments. The power to amend the Colonial Laws Validity Act rests with the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

It is the second book in the Honor Harrington series, In the story, Honor goes on a mission to bring the religiously conservative, sexist world Grayson onto the Manticorans' side in preparation for the inevitable war with Haven.  Plot summary  Three years after the events in On Basilisk Station, Captain Honor Harrington returns to the Star Kingdom after a long anti-piracy campaign in the Silesian Confederacy. While her ship, the heavy cruiser HMS Fearless, has her first refit, new orders arrive. Fearless is to lead a small Manticoran squadron supporting a diplomatic mission to the planet Grayson, a planet ruled by a heavily sexist and patriarchal society, due in part to its fundamentalist Christian and Luddite history, as well as its brutally hostile environment. The diplomatic mission is to be led by Admiral Raoul Courvosier, Honor's mentor and personal friend. With the long-awaited war with Haven looming close, Manticore is working to form an Alliance with many small nations. Grayson is critical to this effort, as it would close a flank of advance for a possible Havenite invasion fleet. Adding to the pressure, Haven is negotiating its own alliance with Masada, Grayson's historical rival. The Manticoran ships arrive at Yeltsin's Star, the system where Grayson is located, and are greeted by the small Grayson Navy. However, the welcome is soured by sexism in the Graysons, for whom the notion of a woman in uniform is intolerable. After several hostile confrontations, Honor leaves the system to escort a convoy of freighters, believing her presence is souring the negotiations, even though Courvosier tries to convince her not to do so. After Honor leaves with three of the four Manticoran warships sent to Grayson, Admiral Courvosier meets with Admiral Bernard Yanakov (the commander of the Grayson Navy), and the officers begin to work their way through their cultural differences, earning some sympathy and respect for each other's point of view. Everything is cut short when a Masadan fleet approaches Grayson and begins attacking space stations throughout the system. Admiral Courvosier accepts Yanakov's offer to join his fleet in chasing the Masadans, not knowing that the Masadans possess two Havenite warships under Captain Alfredo Yu and Cmdr. Thomas Theisman, \\"bought\\" from Haven but reporting to Masadan command. This fleet makes quick work of Grayson's outdated defenders, not to mention the Manticoran destroyer Madrigal, leading to the deaths of both Courvosier and Yanakov. Honor's ships return to Grayson and are attacked by Masadan light attack craft, which damage one of her ships. After entering Grayson's orbit, they are apprised of the critical situation following the battle and the death of Admiral Courvosier. Honor strong-arms Protector Benjamin into allowing her to take a leading role in the defense of Grayson. She also then defends him against Masadan assassins, losing one of her eyes, earning her a great deal of acclaim from the Grayson people. Grayson soon learns that Masada has built an advanced base within Grayson's star system. Leading her ships and the remnants of the Grayson fleet, Honor defeats a group of Masadan warships, as well as the PNS Breslau, now fighting as the MNS Principality. Cmdr. Theisman is able to inflict significant damage on the HMS Apollo, under Cmdr. Alice Truman, but is ultimately forced to surrender. Once in confidence, he tells Honor that there are female POWs from Madrigal at the base, and that he suspects they are being ill-treated. An assault by Fearless' Marines follows, and the Masadan base is captured, finding most of the prisoners executed and all the female prisoners horrifically brutalized, with Honor nearly performing an on the spot execution of the Masadan commander. On Masada, the Havenite \\"advisers\\" see that Masada's bid to conquer Grayson is doomed and try to pull out. However, the Masadans find out and seize control of the Saladin, which they have renamed Thunder of God. Captain Yu catches wind of the mutiny and pulls as many Havenite crew off the ship as he can, leaving the Masadan fanatics in ownership of a Sultan- class battle cruiser which outguns Honor's remaining ships. Honor dispatches Apollo back to Manticore for reinforcements, while her Fearless and Alistair McKeon's Troubadour prepare to fight the Masadans. The Manticorans' superior tactical skills, and the Masadans' unfamiliarity with their ship, allow them to inflict much more damage on Thunder of God than they ought to have done, but Thunder of God by sheer weight of fire is able to destroy Troubadour and inflict equal damage on Fearless. Manticoran reinforcements, summoned by Apollo and led by Admiral Hamish Alexander, Earl White Haven, arrive in- system, but neither Fearless nor Thunder of God are able to detect them due to damage to their radar and gravitic detection equipment. Despite knowing the outcome is hopeless, Honor commits Fearless against Thunder of God hoping to do enough damage to prevent Thunder from carpet bombing Grayson. In a desperate gamble, White Haven's fleet launches from beyond maximum range, distracting the Masadan crew at a crucial moment and allowing Fearless to deliver the killing blow. With Grayson secured, a joint Manticore-Grayson fleet attacks Masada and occupies the planet. Thomas Theisman is returned to Haven. The Havenite refugees from Saladin, led by Alfredo Yu, surrender to the Graysonites; many defect, including Yu himself. Honor recovers from the wounds sustained during the many battles and the attack on the Mayhew family, receiving a prosthetic eye. Protector Benjamin decorates her with the Star of Grayson and appoints her as Steadholder (governor) of a new fief on Grayson, allowing her to help Benjamin speed up his planned social reforms, a program which comes to be known as the \\"Mayhew Restoration.\\" Finally, the Manticoran government creates Honor a Countess and names her a Companion of the Knights of King George.  The players  The Star Kingdom of Manticore is the star nation that occupies the Manticore binary star system. It is a monarchy and the current ruler is Queen Elizabeth III of the House of Winton. The binary Manticore System was located 512 light-years to the Galactic north of the Sol System and Earth. It contained three habitable planets: Gryphon, Sphinx, and the capital planet Manticore.On Basilisk Station (Harrington 1), David Weber, 1993 The Star Kingdom was a single-system nation. From the 19th Century Post Diaspora (when humans left the Sol System) onwards it began to incorporate new systems for strategic reasons, mostly to control the termini of the Manticore Wormhole Junction and the possibility of war with The People's Republic of Haven.Ashes of Victory (Harrington 9), David Weber, 2000Crown of Slaves, David Weber, 2003 The People's Republic of Haven is trying to counter the Manticoran Alliance by aiding the Masadans and throwing a potential alliance between Manticore and Grayson off-balance. The Havenites know that Masada is not a reliable ally, but they accept it for the moment. Unlike Manticore, they keep very well hidden to the Masadans that they treat their women as equals. The Protectorate of Grayson is desperate for foreign aid to sustain its growing industrial base and technological development, as well as to end their conflict with Masada, a conflict on which diplomacy is impossible. Manticore is more reliable for the Grayson leaders (who also want to modernize their society) than the voracious People's Republic. Masada has just one goal: to conquer Grayson and restore the \\"true Faith\\" to their original world. In the eyes of the Masadan leadership, an alliance with Haven is nothing more than a provisional deal with a bunch of \\"infidels\\", a deal from which both sides may get benefits, but nothing more than that.

It provides an array of investment research and investment management services. Joe Mansueto founded Morningstar in 1984. Morningstar's research and recommendations are considered by financial journalists as influential in the asset management industry, and a positive or negative recommendation from Morningstar analysts can drive money into or away from any given fund. Through its asset management division, the firm currently manages over $200 billion as of March 31, 2019. The firm also provides software and data platforms for investment professionals, including \\"Morningstar Direct\\" and \\"Morningstar Advisor Workstation\\". History Founder Joe Mansueto initially had the idea for Morningstar in 1982 while reviewing mutual fund annual reports he had requested from several prominent fund managers. However, it was only after a year working as a stock analyst for Harris Associates, seeing the fund industry and potential competitors up close, that he was convinced that the opportunity was there. Morningstar was subsequently founded in 1984 from his one-bedroom Chicago apartment with an initial investment of US$80,000. The name Morningstar is taken from the last sentence in Walden, a book by Henry David Thoreau; \\"the sun is but a morning star\\". In July 1999, Morningstar accepted an investment of US$91 million from SoftBank in return for a 20 percent stake in the company. The two companies had formed a joint venture in Japan the previous year. Morningstar's initial public offering occurred on May 3, 2005, with 7,612,500 shares at $18.50 each. The manner in which Morningstar went public is notable. They elected to follow Google's footsteps and use the OpenIPO method rather than the traditional method. This allowed individual investors to bid on the price of the stock, and allowed all investors equal access. As of February 2015, Joe Mansueto owned approximately 55% of the outstanding shares in Morningstar. In September 2016, Morningstar announced that it had appointed Kunal Kapoor as chief executive officer, effective January 2017, with Mansueto becoming executive chairman at the same time. In April 2020, Morningstar announced it had reached an agreement to acquire Sustainalytics, a research and rating firm specialized in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) insights. Products and services Morningstar offers a wide array of products and services to both retail and institutional investors. =Morningstar Investment Management= Through its investment management subsidiary, Morningstar currently has over $200 billion in assets under advisement and management. =Morningstar Direct= Morningstar Direct is a software platform that provides data and analytics to help professional investment managers craft new products and portfolios. The product is mainly cloud-based. =Morningstar Office Cloud= Morningstar offers a single end-to-end cloud-based platform for investment advisors, known as Morningstar Office Cloud. The software allows financial advisors to manage their practice, gain access to data and research, analyze investments, and connect with investors. =Morningstar Premium= The firm offers retail and individual investors with access to news, research, and stock, bond, and mutual fund analysis through its 'Morningstar Premium' subscription product. =Credit Ratings (NRSRO)= In 2010, Morningstar acquired Realpoint, LLC, a former division of private-equity giant Capmark Finance and a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). The firm was rebranded as Morningstar Credit Ratings and competes with S&P;, Moody's Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and similar Wall Street firms to provide research and ratings of structured debt products, including mortgage- backed securities and asset-backed securities. Today, Morningstar Credit Ratings issues credit ratings on both structured financial products (CMBS, RMBS, CLOs) and corporate/financial institutions. On May 29, 2019, Morningstar publicly announced its intention to significantly expand the breadth and scope of its ratings business through a $669 million acquisition of DBRS. Influence and criticisms Morningstar is considered powerful in the investment management industry, and the firm's ratings and recommendations often influence a fund's assets under management. The firm's \\"star\\" ratings are often used by fund managers in marketing materials, and positive star ratings bring a credibility to a fund's strategy. Morningstar's analysts and data are frequently quoted in outlets such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Financial Times. In October 2017, the Wall Street Journal published a front-page feature story criticizing Morningstar's influence and questioned the predictive power of the firm's ratings system. In response, Morningstar provided a quantitative analysis showing that higher-rated funds outperform lower-rated funds, but cautioned against using the ratings as a definitive marker of future performance. Corporate identity Morningstar's current logo was designed by the famed graphic designer Paul Rand. The design features the \\"o\\" in Morningstar appearing as a rising sun, which is a nod to a Henry David Thoreau quote that inspired the company's name. Mansueto considers the logo \\"one of our most valuable assets\\".

She was the U.S. Women's Chess Champion in 1959, but not a chess master. She appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, making her the first chess player to appear on its cover (Bobby Fischer was later). Early life and chess career Born in Philadelphia, Lane never knew her father, a leather glazer. As a child, she and her sister Evelyn lived with their grandmother and various neighbors while their mother held down two jobs. In 1957, while attending Temple University, Lisa struck and killed an elderly woman while driving her mother's car (Lane was not charged); this, and the end of a love affair, set Lane into a depression. After investing her remaining savings in a Philadelphia bookstore, Lane began playing chess at local coffeehouses and \\"winning all the time\\", she said. After coaching by master Attilio Di Camillo, Lane won the women's championship of Philadelphia in 1958 and took her first U.S. Women's Chess Championship in 1959 at the age of 21, just two years after she began playing the game. She held this title until 1962, losing it to Gisela Kahn Gresser. Lane had an Elo rating of 2002, a low expert rating, from the United States Chess Federation as of the end of 1961. (available on DVD). In 1963, Lane opened her own chess club, The Queen's Pawn Chess Emporium in New York City. In 1966, she shared the U.S. Women's Chess Champion title with Gresser. She competed in the Women's' World Championship Tournament twice, in 1962 (joint 12th of 17) and 1965 (12th of 18). Lane has been married twice ‚Äì first to Walter Rich, a Philadelphia ad man and commercial artist, from 1959‚Äì1961; then to Neil Hickey, editor-at-large of the Columbia Journalism Review, since 1962. Both Lisa and her husband were friends of Bobby Fischer and assisted Fischer in some chess articles. (Despite her friendship with him, Fischer was not impressed with Lane's, or any woman's, chess playing abilities: \\"They're all fish. Lisa, you might say, is the best of the American fish.\\") Later life According to two-time U.S. Women's Chess Champion Jennifer Shahade (author of Chess Bitch, a book about women chess players), Lisa quit the game partly because she was annoyed with being identified as a chess player. \\"It got to be embarrassing, constantly being introduced as a chess champion at parties.\\" On her fame, Hickey said, \\"I guess I was good copy. I don't think the things I did in chess forty years ago are the most important things in my life.\\" In the 1970s, Lane and her husband opened a gift shop called Amber Waves of Grain (now called Earth Lore), in Pawling, New York. Television appearances Miss Lane appeared as a contestant on the May 21, 1961, episode of the TV show To Tell the Truth. All four panel members (Polly Bergen, Don Ameche, Kitty Carlisle, and Tom Poston) correctly guessed her identity.

The railroad consisted of 3.56 miles of double track and 5.3 miles of sidings. It owned no locomotives or rolling stock. The line connected the Philadelphia and Reading Rail Road line at the west end of the Columbia Bridge over the Schuylkill River, crossed the Pennsylvania Railroad line, ran parallel to Market Street, and turned south to connect with the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad at Gray's Ferry. It came under Pennsylvania Railroad control in 1881, and was eliminated by merger in 1908. History In 1860, there were four lines into downtown Philadelphia from the west: *The Reading came southeasterly along the west bank of the Schuylkill to Belmont, where it crossed the river and entered downtown from the northwest. *The Pennsylvania came from the west-northwest and hit the west bank of the Schuylkill near 32nd Street, turning southeast and crossing the river along Market Street into downtown. *The West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad met the west bank near the PW&B;'s Newkirk Viaduct at Grays Ferry, turned northeast onto 31st Street and ended at Market Street. *The PW&B; came from the southwest along the current Airport Line and crossed the Viaduct and entered downtown from the south. The former roadbed is currently known as Washington Avenue. The Junction Railroad was incorporated on May 3, 1860, to connect the Reading, Pennsylvania, and PW&B; lines through West Philadelphia, which sits across the Schuylkill from downtown. , May 2004 Edition The three lines each bought a one-third share in the Junction Railroad on August 1, 1861, and the company was organized on October 3. , May 2004 Edition Construction began from Belmont to West Philadelphia in 1862, including trackage rights along the PRR between 35th Street (now Zoo interlocking) and Market Street; , May 2004 Edition this opened on November 23, 1863. From West Philadelphia south to Grays Ferry, the Junction Railroad mostly paralleled the WC&P;, and had to cross it somewhere, leading to a dispute between the two companies and a delay in opening the southern half. , May 2004 Edition One track opened south of the WC&P; crossing at Spruce Street in December 1864, giving a temporary routing via the WC&P; through West Philadelphia. , June 2004 Edition The final portion, from Market Street to Spruce Street, including the Market Street Tunnel, opened on July 1, 1866. , June 2004 Edition The Connecting Railway, operated by the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad, opened in 1867. , June 2004 Edition It served as another connecting link, running from the Junction Railroad and PRR main line at Zoo interlocking east to the lines heading north from downtown. In 1871, the south end was reconfigured due to the Darby Improvement, which moved the PW&B; to the current Northeast Corridor alignment; , January 2005 Edition the old alignment was leased to the Reading in 1873. The Reading began operating passenger trains over the entire Junction Railroad on September 3, 1873, with a transfer to the PW&B; at Grays Ferry. , February 2005 Edition On April 1, 1876, the Reading leased the northern piece of the line for a year to access a temporary station for U.S. centennial celebrations. , April 2006 Edition The PRR ownership of the middle portion led to problems starting in 1880, when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad shifted its New York traffic coming off the PW&B; to the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad, using the entire Junction Railroad to Belmont. The PRR gained control of the PW&B; in 1881, forcing the B&O; to build the Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad to retain Philadelphia access; this line completely avoided the Junction Railroad by running along the east bank of the Schuylkill. Chapter 32. Through Reading trains were also moved off the Junction Railroad, using the B&O;'s route instead. The PB&W; leased the Junction Railroad on March 1, 1899. The PRR's West Philadelphia Elevated line, completed in 1904, provided an alternate route for freight trains that would use the central piece of the Junction Railroad through the Market Street Tunnel or the PRR's River Line along the Schuylkill. , March 2005 Edition =Merged with PRR= The Junction Railroad was merged into the PRR on March 31, 1908, becoming the Belmont Branch north of and the Grays Ferry Branch (also 32nd Street Branch) south of West Philadelphia. , March 2005 Edition Except for the Market Street Tunnel, the Grays Ferry Branch was part of the main line from Broad Street Station towards Baltimore. The Belmont Branch remained a connection to the Reading. =Post-PRR= After the PRR and Reading both became part of Conrail in 1976, it became part of the Harrisburg Line, along with the West Philadelphia Elevated Branch and Delaware Extension to Greenwich Yard.Conrail. \\"Conrail System Map Showing The Proposed Allocation Of Conrail Lines & Rights.\\" Reformatted by Norfolk Southern Engineering Systems.

He also hit more lead-off home runs than anyone in Japanese history, with 43. In 2002 (Heisei 14), Fukumoto was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame.  Playing career  After a brief career at the company team of Matsushita, he was drafted seventh overall by the Hankyu Braves (currently the Orix Buffaloes) in 1968. In his second season, he stole 75 bases, setting the Japanese single-season record. In 1972 (Sh≈çwa 47), he stole 106 bases, setting the all-world single-season modern-era record, which stood until it was broken by Rickey Henderson. He also led the Braves to the Japanese championship. Fukumoto was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) and became the first Japanese MVP who had also led the league in steals. In 1983, he stole his 939th career base, passing Lou Brock and setting the all-world career steals mark (later passed by Rickey Henderson in 1993). That year he also collected his 2000th career hit. He was contacted for a People's Honour Award, but declined.  Retirement  After the 1988 season, the Braves were slated to become the Orix Blue Wave. At the last game of the year, manager Toshiharu Ueda delivered a farewell address at the post-game ceremony. Ueda made the mistake of saying, \\"We bid farewell to Yamada and Fukumoto (who will leave the team) ...\\" instead of \\"We bid farewell to Yamada but will have Fukumoto (for the new team) ...\\". Everyone was caught by surprise, including Fukumoto himself, since he had intended to play at least another year. Fukumoto shrugged to reporters and said, \\"Ueda said so, I'm retiring\\", and ended his career. He retired with 2,543 hits, 208 home runs, 449 doubles (2nd all-time), 115 triples, 884 runs batted in, 1,065 stolen bases, and a .291 batting average, in 2401 games. Fukumoto felt no ill will towards Ueda and went on to coach for Orix in 1989 and 1990. From 1998 to 1999, he coached for the Hanshin Tigers.

He was a prolific composer of madrigals and instrumental music, and was renowned as one of the finest organists in Italy in the late 16th century; he was also the principal teacher of Adriano Banchieri. Life He was born in Lucca, and was the brother of Francesco Guami (born 1543). Little is known about his early life, but he must have received some early training for he came to St. Mark's in Venice, one of the most prestigious musical institutions in Italy, in 1561; there he studied with Adrian Willaert and Annibale Padovano, and served as a singer. In 1568 he left Venice and went to Bavaria, serving as first organist at the court of Albrecht of Bavaria, the location of the famous Franco-Flemish composer Orlande de Lassus. In the early 1570s he returned to Italy, at least temporarily, and accompanied by Lassus at least once; and he was hired as organist in Lucca in 1579, where he stayed until 1582 or later. In 1585 he was working as maestro di cappella in Genoa. Precise details of his movements are uncertain until his return to St. Mark's, but it is certain that he was composing and acquiring fame as an organist during these years. In 1588 he was appointed to the post of first organist at St. Mark's (there were two organists, who usually also served as composers, under the direction of the maestro di cappella, who at that time was Gioseffo Zarlino). When Zarlino died Guami returned to Lucca, possibly because he was not appointed as Zarlino's successor; in Lucca he was employed as the organist at the cathedral, where he stayed until he died. Works and influence The major influences on Guami's sacred music style are from Willaert, his teacher at St. Mark's, and Cipriano de Rore, and later from Lassus; indeed the two composers may have been friends since they served together in Munich and evidently traveled together. In his secular music he was most progressive, using an unusual amount of chromaticism and modulation to distant keys, undoubtedly influenced by Nicola Vicentino. Guami also wrote numerous instrumental canzonas; most likely he wrote organ music which has been lost (only one piece survives, in a collection by Girolamo Diruta). The canzonas are in the up-to-date Venetian style, antiphonal, ornamented, and using starkly different thematic material in different sections; however they contain an unusual level of motivic development for pre-Baroque music. Guami was also important as a teacher, providing instruction to composers such as Adriano Banchieri, one of the key figures in the transition to the Baroque style. Vincenzo Galilei, the progressive music theorist, lutenist, and father of the astronomer, also wrote about Guami's music, talent and fame.

The knot can be applied to emergency situations, such as mountain rescue. Etymology The name comes from the three loops that would be formed by tying this knot. Tying The knot is tied in the same way the original bowline is, except with a doubled rope (using a bight). An overhand loop is formed in the rope, the working end is passed back through that loop, behind the standing part of the rope, back through the loop and pulled tight. The working end (bight) forms a third loop, often larger than the two equal-sized loops. The size of the third loop depends on the length of the bight pulled through the loop. Bowline on the bight A bowline on the bight is a similar knot to the triple bowline. Instead of wrapping the bight around the standing end and then passing it back through the nipping loop, the two loops are passed through the bight so that it tightens on the standing end. It has only two active or available loops. This is used in rescue situations, especially in a case where there might be an injured person or people, as it forms a \\"seat\\" in which the injured person can be raised or lowered safely. The full triple bowline is also used in rescue situations with the third loop passed around the waist or torso. Double Bowline The triple bowline is often mistakenly referred to as the double bowline. The double bowline is in fact a bowline tied on a single strand with the nipping loop doubled up, and only has one loop.

It preserves lava molds of the tree trunks that were formed when a lava flow swept through a forested area in 1790. Park Information =Features= A footpath forms a loop through the park. Like all Hawaii state parks, there is no charge for parking and entry. Facilities include restrooms, picnic tables, and 3 covered structures to provide refuge from the rain or sun. It is open daily during daylight hours only, since there are no lights on the path. No camping, and no mountain bikes are allowed in the park. There are no water fountains at the park; bring your own water. Although there is a paved path, tree roots have lifted and separated parts of the path so toddlers and the elderly may need assistance. =Directions= From the Hawaii Belt Road (State Route 11), take Highway 130, known as Keaau-PƒÅhoa Road, toward the town of PƒÅhoa. Bypass the first intersection that would take you into PƒÅhoa by staying to the left. Continue to the traffic light where PƒÅhoa Bypass Road, Keaau-PƒÅhoa Rd and PƒÅhoa-Kapoho roads meet. At this intersection, make a left onto Highway 132, PƒÅhoa-Kapoho Road. Continue for about to Lava Tree Road on your left. The park is located on your right, about down Lava Tree Road. =History= The land was once part of the extensive ranch of William Herbert Shipman. Although ancient Hawaiians knew the molds were from a lava flow, one of the first to propose that they were from former trees was Rufus Anderson Lyman. It was closed in May 2018 due to the eruption of Kƒ´lauea when lava flows approached the park.

Exactly what happened is never explained, but sea levels have risen significantly, inundating coastal cities such as Yokohama, Mount Fuji erupted in living memory, and climate change has occurred. With the seasons being less pronounced, the winters are milder and the summer isn't scorching anymore. The reduced human population has reverted to a simpler life, and the reader is told this is the twilight of the human age. One scene depicts an anti-aircraft missile being used in a firework display. Instead of raging against their fate, humans are quietly accepting. Alpha Hatsuseno is an android (\\"robot person\\") who runs an out-of-the-way coffee shop, Caf√© Alpha, on the lonely coast of the Miura Peninsula of Japan, while her human \\"owner\\" is on a trip of indefinite length. Though she spends much of her time alone, Alpha is cheerful, gregarious, and‚Äîunlike the slowly declining humans‚Äîimmortal. Most chapters of Yokohama Kaidashi Kik≈ç are self-contained slice-of-life episodes depicting Alpha in daily activities, either alone, with customers, or on occasional trips through the countryside or into Yokohama for supplies (whence the \\"shopping log\\" of the title came). Whole chapters are devoted to brewing coffee, taking photographs, or repairing a tiny model aircraft engine, sometimes with only a few lines of dialogue. Through Alpha's experiences, the author brings out the small wonders of everyday life and makes the reader aware of their passing: the aircraft engine runs out of fuel; her scooter breaks down; the rising ocean encroaches on her coffee shop; the neighborhood children she loves grow up and move away. In evoking a nostalgia for this loss, Ashinano follows the Japanese tradition of mono no aware (sadness for the transience of things). Though often self-contained, the stories have continuity‚Äîrelationships grow and change, and seemingly insignificant details reappear later. Ashinano explains few details of Alpha's world, leaving mysteries that engage the reader as the series unfolds in a meandering progression, by turns funny, touching, and nostalgic. Characters Alpha (left) and Kokone (right) from a color page of the manga ; : :A type A7M2 robot, one of only three production prototypes, who runs Caf√© Alpha in the absence of her owner (whose family name is Hatsuseno). Alpha is cheerful and thoughtful. She enjoys talking with her few customers, but is initially socially awkward and sheltered‚Äîdespite being her model's prototype, at the start of the series she has met only a few people and no other robots. Because of this, when her owner departed, she declined to travel with him. As the series progresses, however, she grows more confident in her social skills, enough so that she spends a year traveling herself, and becomes more attached to her human friends even as they age and depart. Alpha is not very experienced about human behavior or appearances, she uses dishwasher liquid instead of brushing her teeth and doesn't think of her eye or hair color being strange. One of her unique abilities is that she is, according to her emotions, able to induce tears in her eye moisturizers. In her spare time, Alpha plays a gekkin, carves small art objects with fish designs, and travels the local countryside on her scooter, investigating the remains of humanity's previous age and the emerging world to come. ; : :A type A7M3 production robot who works as a courier in what remains of Musashino, Tokyo. She is the first robot that Alpha meets, when she delivers a package (containing a camera) and a message from Alpha's owner. They soon become friends. Kokone is sweet, shy, and somewhat intellectual, but because of her job she has more experience with people than Alpha, and can sometimes pass for human. After meeting Alpha, her \\"older sister\\" production-wise, Kokone becomes curious about the history and nature of robots. Unlike Alpha, she is able to process animal protein. ; : :A middle-aged man with a perpetual grin, he is Alpha's closest neighbor and a regular customer at her caf√©. He runs a gas station and sells vegetables on the side. He is a grandfather-figure to Alpha and the actual grandfather of Takahiro. Ojisan refers to himself as a bum, and seems to regret not pursuing a relationship with Sensei when they were younger. His real name is never given. ; : :An older woman, she is a doctor for both humans and androids. She was involved in the creation of the A7 series of robots, and hosted Director Alpha in her home, possibly as Director Alpha's owner. When she was younger, she rode motorcycles and raced hovercraft, and was Ojisan's senpai from school. Her surname is , but she is always addressed by just her title. ; : :The grandson of Ojisan, who lives with his grandparents. He meets Alpha at age nine, and she quickly takes to him as if he were a younger brother. He is the first character in the series to meet the Misago. As he grows up, Takahiro becomes fascinated with engines of all types and eventually moves away in his mid-teens to work for Nai. ; : :A girl a few years younger than Takahiro. She likes Takahiro and is initially jealous of Alpha. Makki eventually becomes close to Alpha after learning the latter would never consider having a relationship with Takahiro because mortal humans move through time in a different way than immortal robots. She is skeptical of Takahiro's stories of the Misago until she meets the wild-woman herself. In her early teens, Makki works for a while at Alpha's caf√©, before moving away to become a courier with Kokone's company, and then later to Hamamatsu to be with Takahiro. ; :An ageless wild-woman who lives in the inlets and bays near Caf√© Alpha. She is always naked, and eats raw fish, crabs and insects caught using her short fangs and inhuman speed which enables her to run on water and easily jump 10 metres high. She only shows herself to young children, and shies away from contact with adults. She does not age and, according to omake material, does not understand how children grow up. While Ayase claims she existed \\"decades before\\" robots were created, it is later implied by Doctor that she is the first robot. Despite Misago's feral nature, she is a gentle person, and does not cause harm to anyone beyond accidentally scaring some of the children she encounters. ;Ayase :A wanderer who travels endlessly, relying on his kamas (a large predatory flying fish) to live off the land. He likes to see the curiosities of the world, and is especially fascinated by the Misago after an encounter with her as a child. Because of Makki's affinity for the Misago and his kamas, he tries to convince her to travel with him as a sort of prot√©g√©. ;Director Alpha :The A7M1 prototype of the A7 series, and thus \\"older sister\\" to the other A7 robots. Like Alpha Hatsuseno, Director Alpha acquired her given name because she is the initial model, or \\"alpha-type\\", of a robot series. She is the director of a stratospheric aircraft called Taapon that circles the Earth without landing, observing the world's changes from above without ever being able to leave. Her surname is Koumi'ishi, the same as Sensei, and she has a pendant with Sensei's logo, indicating a past with her that is never elaborated on, and she never interacts with any of the other major characters. ; :A type A7M3 robot with a prickly personality. She is an artist who lives in Yokohama and works as a waitress and then shopclerk as a day job. She is unusual among robots for having changed her surname to one of her own choosing rather than adopting her owner's. Her given name is pronounced the same as her surname, but spelled in katakana. She likes Kokone and is jealous of Alpha for \\"taking\\" her. Nai sometimes sends her sensory impressions, delivered by Kokone, which she uses in her art. ;Nai : :An A7 robot of unknown model. He is unusual because for unknown reasons the majority of male robots rarely survive for very long after activation. He runs a delivery service, flying an AT-6 Texan aircraft. Nai is quiet and impassive. ;Saetta :The young daughter of Makki and Takahiro. She is the last character to meet the Misago. Influences and themes Flying and flight recurs through the series. Alpha herself has repeated visions of flying. Planes that appear include Nai's airplane, the always-flying Taapon, and the model airplane engine that Alpha finds but never flies. The A7 series of robots is named after a Japanese World War II warplane Mitsubishi A7M that never saw production, and the character Saetta's name may be inspired by an Italian World War II warplane built by Aeronautica Macchi. Takahiro leaves (\\"flies away\\") to work for Nai. Ayase's kamas is a kind of flying fish. In the postscript episode, the unnamed character travels by glider. The series contains elements of Chinese culture and mythology. Alpha's gekkin guitar is of Chinese origin, and the Taapon aircraft is named after the mythological bird Peng (taapon is the Japanese transliteration of da peng). Some character names appear in the geography of the Yokohama area. For example, there is a bus stop named Koumi'ishi to the south of Hayama, and Atsugi airfield, where Alpha meets Nai, is located in Ayase. There is a place called Maruko in Yokohama where Maruko's gallery is supposed to be. Map of the setting of Yokohama Kaidashi Kik≈ç, showing how the coastline of the Miura Peninsula has changed That several details of Yokohama Kaidashi Kik≈ç are left unexplained, or have answers only hinted at, is frequently mentioned in reviews of the series as contributing to a tone of mystery. Some are mysteries to the characters, which they speculate about without reaching conclusions, while others are presented to the reader without comment. Among the most prominent are: * What is the nature of the natural disaster that caused the world's oceans to rise? * Who is Alpha's owner, and where did he go? Why does Ayase call him \\"sensei\\"? * Why were robots created? Since none are slaves or servants, what is their purpose? In what sense are they, as Kokone claims, humanity's children? * Why are the humans in Alpha's world dying out? * Why are male robots so rare? * Why is Alpha, unlike other robots, allergic to animal proteins? * What are the \\"water gods\\", strangely beautiful mushrooms with human faces, that have started growing in the wilds? * Why have trees that mimic streetlamps and fungi that mimic buildings begun growing? Are they really, as Alpha and Ayase speculate, the \\"recollections of people that the earth remembers\\"?Ayase: Alpha: * When was the eruption that removed Mount Fuji's top, and was it related to the ocean rise? * What is the Misago? Why does she only show herself to children, and why is she unable to comprehend that they become adults? If, as Ayase claims, she is not a robot, then what is she? Comparisons have been made between Yokohama Kaidashi Kik≈ç and Aria, noting that they are both quiet slice-of-life stories in a futuristic setting with a similar emotional effect. A reviewer at Uknighted Manganime wrote, \\"What the two have in common, though, is a bright look at the future and a generally optimistic view of humanity, despite our failings.\\" Media =Manga= A total of 140 chapters were published in Japan by Kodansha in the seinen (aimed at younger adult men) manga magazine Monthly Afternoon between June 1994 to February 2006.

A theater can include the entirety of the airspace, land and sea area that is or that may potentially become involved in war operations.  Theater of war  In his book On War, Carl von Clausewitz defines the term Kriegstheater (translating the older, 17th-century Latin term theatrum belli) as one that: \\"Denotes properly such a portion of the space over which war prevails as has its boundaries protected, and thus possesses a kind of independence. This protection may consist of fortresses, or important natural obstacles presented by the country, or even in its being separated by a considerable distance from the rest of the space embraced in the war. Such a portion is not a mere piece of the whole, but a small whole complete in itself; and consequently it is more or less in such a condition that changes which take place at other points in the seat of war have only an indirect and no direct influence upon it. To give an adequate idea of this, we may suppose that on this portion an advance is made, whilst in another quarter a retreat is taking place, or that upon the one an army is acting defensively, whilst an offensive is being carried on upon the other. Such a clearly defined idea as this is not capable of universal application; it is here used merely to indicate the line of distinction.\\"  Theater of operations  Theater of operations (TO) is a sub- area within a theater of war. The boundary of a TO is defined by the commander who is orchestrating or providing support for specific combat operations within the TO. Theater of operations is divided into strategic directions or military regions depending on whether it's a war or peacetime. The United States Armed Forces split into Unified Combatant Commands (regions) that are assigned to a particular theater of military operations. A strategic direction is a group of armies also known as a task (field) forces or battlegroups. A strategic command or direction in general essence would combine a number of tactical military formations or operational command. In the modern military, a strategic command is better known as a combat command that may be a combination of groups.  Soviet and Russian Armed Forces  The Soviet and Russian Armed Forces classify a large geographic subdivision ‚Äì such as continental geographic territories with their bordering maritime areas, islands, adjacent coastsSee: and airspace ‚Äì as a theater. The Russian- language term for a military \\"theater\\" is , teatr voennykh deistvii (literally: \\"theater of military operations\\"), abbreviated , TVD. The division of large continental and maritime areas assists in determining the limits within which to develop plans for the operations of strategic military groups of forces, allowing military operations of specific significant \\"strategic directions\\" known as \\"fronts\\", which were originally named in accordance with their theater of operations; for example the Southwestern Front (Russian Empire) (1914‚Äì1918), the 1st Ukrainian Front (1943‚Äì1945, which fought in Ukraine, Poland, Germany, and Czechoslovakia), and the Northern Front (Soviet Union) (June to August, 1941). In peacetime, lacking the urgencies of a strategic direction, fronts were transformed into military regions (districts) responsible for an assigned section of operations.  United States  Unified Combatant Command of the United States. Chart 12.- Typical organization of a theater of operations as envisaged by War Department Doctrine, 1940. The term \\"theater of operations\\" was defined in the American field manuals as the land and sea areas to be invaded or defended, including areas necessary for administrative activities incident to the military operations (chart 12). In accordance with the experience of World War I, it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas‚Äìthe combat zone, or the area of active fighting, and the communications zone, or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control.

G. Wodehouse. Lord Emsworth's younger brother, a lifelong bachelor, Gally was, according to Beach, the Blandings butler, \\"somewhat wild as a young man\\". When he appears in the Blandings books, he is in his mid- to late-fifties, has thick grey hair and wears a black-rimmed monocle on a black ribbon.  Life and character  Galahad is the only one of the Threepwood siblings never to have married. His true love was Dolly Henderson, with whom he was in love from 1896 to 1898 but who, as a music-hall singer who wore pink tights, was not an appropriate bride for a man of his social status. His father sent him to South Africa to prevent him from marrying, following which he spent most of his life drinking heavily and getting up to mischief. A member of the notorious Pelican Club, he appears to have travelled widely and known many people. The prospect of Galahad's writing his reminiscences causes a good deal of consternation among England's well- established upper-class because he had, in younger days, been \\"a notable lad about town,\\" a partier, drinker, prankster, and ladies' man, and his stories are liable to embarrass his former comrades, most of whom have grown into respectable gentlemen. One particularly embarrassing story concerns Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe and prawns, though we never learn many details of the incident, other than that it took place at Ascot, \\"the year Martingale won the Gold Cup\\". His wildness makes him very popular with the members of the Blandings servants hall, who feel he sheds lustre on the castle, but less so with his sisters, who find him something of an embarrassment, particularly when recalling stories of their now-respectable friends. Despite the fact that he \\"apparently never went to bed until he was fifty\\", he is in remarkable shape, a sprightly, rosy, dapper man with bright eyes and a jaunty posture.  Appearances  Galahad appears in seven novels and a single short story: * Summer Lightning (1929) * Heavy Weather (1933) * Full Moon (1947) * Pigs Have Wings (1952) * Galahad at Blandings (1965) * \\"Sticky Wicket at Blandings\\", from Plum Pie (1966) * A Pelican at Blandings (1969) * Sunset at Blandings (1977) Gally first appears in Summer Lightning, where he is staying at Blandings to work on his scandalous reminiscences. He appears not to have been a regular visitor to the castle, however, as Baxter, secretary to Lord Emsworth for some time, has never previously met him. Thereafter he becomes a regular visitor, frequently involved in the intrigues and conspiracies that invariably surround the place, generally filling the role of level-headed and resourceful saviour and the champion of youth and romance. In the two Blandings novels after Summer Lightning in which he does not play a part, his shoes are ably filled by his fellow-Pelican Uncle Fred (Lord Ickenham). In fact, it has been said that Ickenham lays down the pattern that Galahad follows. Uncle Fred's first appearance in a Blandings novel is Uncle Fred in the Springtime (1939), in which he arrives at the castle under an assumed name, bringing several other impostors with him. In the next Blandings novel, Full Moon (1947), critic Richard Usborne points out that \\"in patches Gally, [the novel's] real hero, acts and talks more like Lord Ickenham than himself. 'Spreading sweetness and light' is Lord Ickenham's specific role, but here, Wodehouse, seeming to forget, applies these words to Gally.\\" Critic J. H. C. Morris agrees, \\"Gally becomes more and more like Lord Ickenham as the Blandings Saga progresses. In the later stories there is no one like him for telling the tale.\\"  Adaptations  ;Television * In the 1995 BBC television film Heavy Weather, Galahad was portrayed by Richard Briers. * In the 2013‚Äì2014 BBC series Blandings, he was played by Julian Rhind-Tutt. ;Radio * In the 1985‚Äì1992 Blandings radio series, Galahad was voiced by Ian Carmichael. * Galahad was portrayed by Derwent Watson in the 1999 BBC radio dramatisation of Full Moon. * Charles Dance portrayed Galahad in the 2010 BBC radio adaptation of Summer Lightning.

Gabaldon (; born January 11, 1952) is an American author, known for the Outlander series of novels. Her books merge multiple genres, featuring elements of historical fiction, romance, mystery, adventure and science fiction/fantasy. A television adaptation of the Outlander novels premiered on Starz in 2014. Early life and education Gabaldon was born on January 11, 1952, in Scottsdale, Arizona, United States, the daughter of Jacqueline Sykes and Tony Gabaldon (1931‚Äì1998), an Arizona state senator from Flagstaff for sixteen years and later a supervisor of Coconino County. Her father was of Mexican ancestry, and her mother was of English descent. Gabaldon grew up in Flagstaff, Arizona. She earned a bachelor of science in zoology from Northern Arizona University, 1970‚Äì1973; a master of science in marine biology from the University of California, San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 1973‚Äì1975; and a PhD in behavioral ecology from Northern Arizona University, 1975‚Äì1978. Career Gabaldon was the founding editor of Science Software Quarterly in 1984 while employed at the Center for Environmental Studies at Arizona State University. During the mid-1980s, Gabaldon wrote software reviews and technical articles for computer publications, as well as popular- science articles and Disney comics. She was a professor with an expertise in scientific computation at ASU for 12 years before leaving to write full-time. =Novels= Gabaldon signing books at the 2017 Phoenix Comicon In 1988, Gabaldon decided to write a novel for \\"practice, just to learn how\\" and with no intention to show it to anyone. As a research professor, she decided that a historical novel would be easiest to research and write, but she had no background in history and initially no particular time period in mind. Gabaldon happened to see a rerun episode of the Doctor Who science fiction TV series titled \\"The War Games.\\" One of the Doctor's companions was a Scot from around 1745, a young man about 17 years old named Jamie McCrimmon, who provided the initial inspiration for her main male character, James Fraser, and for her novel's mid-18th century Scotland setting. Gabaldon decided to have \\"an Englishwoman to play-off all these kilted Scotsmen,\\" but her female character \\"took over the story and began telling it herself, making smart-ass modern remarks about everything.\\" To explain the character's modern behavior and attitudes, Gabaldon chose to use time travel. Writing the novel at a time \\"when the World Wide Web didn't exist,\\" she did her research \\"the old- fashioned way, by herself, through books.\\" Later Gabaldon posted a short excerpt of her novel on the CompuServe Literary Forum, where author John E. Stith introduced her to literary agent Perry Knowlton. Knowlton represented her based on an unfinished first novel, tentatively titled Cross Stitch. Her first book deal was for a trilogy, the first novel plus two then-unwritten sequels. Her U.S. publishers changed the first book's title to Outlander, but the title remained unchanged in the U.K. According to Gabaldon, her British publishers liked the title Cross Stitch, a play on \\"a stitch in time\\"; however, the American publisher said it \\"sounded too much like embroidery\\" and wanted a more \\"adventurous\\" title. When her second book was finished, Gabaldon resigned her faculty position at Arizona State University to become a full- time author. , the Outlander series comprises eight published novels. The eighth installment, Written in My Own Heart's Blood, was released on June 10, 2014. Gabaldon also published The Exile (An Outlander Graphic Novel) in 2010. The Lord John series is a spin-off from the Outlander books, centering on a secondary character from the original series. Personal life Gabaldon lives in Scottsdale, Arizona with her husband Doug Watkins, with whom she has three adult children. Her son, Sam Sykes, is also a fantasy writer. Gabaldon is a Roman Catholic. Bibliography =Outlander series= The Outlander series focuses on 20th-century nurse Claire Randall, who time travels to 18th-century Scotland and finds adventure and romance with the dashing James Fraser.

He also directed plays on Broadway. Early life and career Adler was born on May 4, 1903, in New York City. He was one of the six children of Russian Jewish actors Sara and Jacob P. Adler. His father was considered to be one of the founders of the Yiddish theatre in America. His siblings also worked in theatre; his sister Stella Adler achieved fame as an actress and drama teacher. His brother Jay also achieved some renown as an actor. Adler's father gave him his first acting job in the Yiddish play, Schmendrick, at the Thalia Theatre in Manhattan in 1908; Adler was then 5 years old. His first Broadway plays were The Hand of the Potter in 1921; Humoresque in 1923; Monkey Talks in 1925; Money Business and We Americans in 1926; John in 1927; Red Rust (or Rust) and Street Scene in 1929. Years in the Group Theatre Group Theatre in 1938 Luther Adler and his sister Stella in a 1936 publicity photo for their appearance in the Group Theater production of Awake and Sing! In 1931 Adler became one of the original members of the Group Theatre (New York), a New York City theatre collective formed by Cheryl Crawford, Harold Clurman, and Lee Strasberg. The founders, as well as the actors in the group, \\"tended to hold left-wing political views and wanted to produce plays that dealt with important social issues.\\" The collective lasted for ten years, had twenty productions, and served as an inspiration for many actors, directors, and playwrights who came after it. During those years, the Group's members included Luther, Luther's sister and brother, Stella Adler and Jay Adler, Elia Kazan, John Garfield, Paul Green (playwright), Howard Da Silva, Harry Morgan (billed as Harry Bratsburg), Franchot Tone, John Randolph, Joseph Bromberg, Michael Gordon, Will Geer, Clifford Odets and Lee J. Cobb. Elia Kazan considered Adler to be the best actor working in the company. In 1932 Adler starred in John Howard Lawson's, Success Story and garnered rave reviews for his performance. In 1933 Adler briefly joined the Katherine Cornell Company, playing opposite Cornell in Alien Corn, but in 1934 he returned to the Group and played alongside his sister Stella in Gold Eagle Guy. Gold Eagle Guy was not popular with audiences and had a short run. Adler had suspected the play would not succeed, remarking, shortly before it opened, \\"Boys, I think we're working on a stiff.\\" Adler went on to appear in Group Theatre (New York) productions: Awake and Sing! and Paradise Lost (both 1935), and he performed with Frances Farmer in Golden Boy (1937). He also appeared in Kurt Weill's anti-war musical Johnny Johnson (1936) and originated the role of Captain Joshua in the 1939 Group Theater production of Thunder Rock. \\"By the late 1930s... the cohesiveness of the group began to crumble. The chronic financial problems and long-simmering disputes about 'the method' began to chip away at their solidarity... and in 1941 the group dissolved.\\"  After the Group Theatre  By the early 1940s, Adler began to direct, but his first production They Should Have Stood in Bed closed after only 11 performances in 1942. His next directorial venture, A Flag Is Born, ran for 120 performances in 1946 and featured newcomer Marlon Brando in one of the major roles. In 1965, when Zero Mostel left the Broadway cast of Fiddler on the Roof during a contract dispute, Adler took over the role of Tevye. Film and television career In 1937 Adler began to appear in films, although they were never his highest priority. His credits included Cornered (1945), Wake of the Red Witch (1948), House of Strangers (1949), D.O.A. (1949), The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel (1951) (appearing as Hitler), and M (1951). During the 1950s Luther Adler was among the directors and actors who were blacklisted.Hollywood blacklist He later appeared in Voyage of the Damned (1976) and Absence of Malice (1981). He also acted frequently on television in such programs as the anthology series, Crossroads, General Electric Theater, Kraft Television Theater and Robert Montgomery Presents. He guest-starred in 1960 in the science fiction fantasy series, The Twilight Zone as the poor pawnbroker Arthur Castle, with Vivi Janiss as his wife Edna, in the episode entitled \\"The Man in the Bottle.\\" in the story line, a genie offers the couple four wishes which do not lead to happiness. He was also cast in episodes of The Untouchables, Ben Casey, 77 Sunset Strip, Mission: Impossible, Hawaii Five-O, most notably in the series' only three-part episode \\"'V' for Vashon\\", The Streets of San Francisco, Naked City and Route 66. Personal life Adler was married to actress Sylvia Sidney from 1938 until 1946 and was the father of Sidney's only child, her son Jacob, who predeceased her. A lifelong Democrat, he, and his siblings, supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.Motion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers He died at his Kutztown, Pennsylvania home, and was buried in Mount Carmel Cemetery, Glendale, New York, next to several of his relatives, including his older sister Stella.

Yacoub subsequently performed the UK's first combined heart and lung transplant in 1983. From 1986 to 2006, he held the position of British Heart Foundation Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine. He is the founding editor of the journal Disease Models & Mechanisms. His honours and awards include the Bradshaw Lecture from the Royal College of Physicians in 1988, a knighthood in the 1992 New Year Honours, the Texas Heart Institute's Ray C. Fish Award for Scientific Achievement in Cardiovascular Disease in 1998, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004, the European Society of Cardiology's Gold Medal in 2006, the Order of Merit in 2014, the Lister Medal from the Royal College of Surgeons in 2015 and the Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor Achievement Award (KAHAA) in 2019. Following retirement from the National Health Service (NHS), he continued to operate on children through his charity, Chain of Hope. In 2008, he co-founded the Magdi Yacoub heart foundation, which launched the Aswan Heart project. Early life and education Magdi Habib Yacoub was born on the 16th of November in 1935Yacoub, Magdi. Curriculum Vitae: Magdi Yacoub. in Bilbeis, El Sharqia, Egypt to Coptic Christian family, and spent his childhood moving around a number of different small towns. His father was a surgeon, who later worked in public health. He died in 1958. Yacoub later recalled that both his father and the death of his youngest aunt at age 22 years from an uncorrected mitral stenosis during childbirth inspired him to study medicine and cardiology, saying that ‚Äúthis young woman would not have died if we had had access to facilities which were then available in a few centres around the world‚Äù. At the age of 15, he entered the University of Cairo College of Medicine with a scholarship.  Early surgical career  National Heart Hospital In 1957, Yacoub graduated in medicine from Cairo University and completed two years of residencies in surgery. In 1961 or 1962 he moved to Britain to study for his fellowship while working under Sir Russell Brock, consultant surgeon at Guy's Hospital. =Heart valve surgery= Ross Procedure In 1964, he was appointed rotating surgical senior registrar to the National Heart and Chest Hospitals, where he worked with cardiothoracic surgeon Donald Ross. Here, they worked on repairing heart valves in people with severe valvular heart disease and heart failure. Four of their cases, operated on between December 1965 and October 1967, were reported on in the British Medical Journal (1968) in an article titled \\"Too ill for cardiac surgery?\\". Three had severe aortic valve disease and one had rheumatic heart disease with multiple affected valves. All four had a poor prognosis with death expected within a few days and all four survived surgery. He carried out a number of Ross procedures, where the diseased aortic valve is replaced with the person's own pulmonary valve, particularly in growing children. It became a popular alternative to the surgical treatment of aortic valve disease in young adults and avoided the need for anticoagulation and repeated operations. Yacoub modified the operation by planning remodelling of the autograft root, the Ross-Yacoub procedure,Mark Ruzmetov, Karl F. Welke, Dale M. Geiss, Klay Buckley and Randall S. Fortuna (2014). ‚ÄúFailed Autograft After the Ross Procedure in Children: Management and Outcome‚Äù. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Elsevier. performed in carefully selected people. At a time when cardiologists may have been reluctant to refer for surgery, Yacoub's search for operable people earned him the name \\"Magdi's midnight stars\\". Later, his application for a job at the Royal Brompton Hospital was turned down. In 1968, he moved to the United States and the following year he became Instructor and then Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago. Harefield Hospital In 1973, he returned to England and became a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at Harefield Hospital, West London, a previous sanatorium built during the First World War consisting of numerous small houses with interconnected corridors. He later recalled that \\"I was tempted to stay in Chicago, as I was interested in the research they were doing there, but I had already accepted the position at Harefield before going to the US, so I was honour bound to return\\". At Harefield, he worked closely with Rosemary Radley-Smith, consultant in paediatric cardiology. As a visiting professor to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Yacoub, Fabian Udekwu, C. H Anyanwu, and others formed part of the team that performed the first open heart surgery in Nigeria in 1974.John C. Eze, Ndubueze Ezemba, Open-Heart Surgery in Nigeria Indications and Challenges, Tex Heart Inst J. 2007; 34(1): 8‚Äì10. =Arterial Switch= Arterial switch operation In 1977, he devised a two-stage approach for an arterial switch operation (ASO) in older people with transposition of the great arteries with an intact ventricular septum (IVS). =Harefield Hospital transplant unit = Yacoub began the transplant programme at Harefield Hospital in 1980 with a heart transplant for Derrick Morris, who became Europe's longest surviving heart transplant recipient until his death in July 2005. Two years later, he performed a heart transplant on John McCafferty, who survived for more than 33 years, until 10 February 2016 and became recognised as the world's longest surviving heart transplant patient by the Guinness World Records in 2013, surpassing the previous Guinness World Record of 30 years, 11 months and 10 days set by an American man who died in 2009. In December 1983 Yacoub performed the UK's first combined heart and lung transplant at Harefield. From 1986 to 2006, he held the position of British Heart Foundation Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine. In 1988, he became a member of the Royal Colleges of Physicians, twenty years after qualifying in surgery. He is the founding editor of the journal Disease Models & Mechanisms. He treated a number of politicians and celebrities throughout his surgical career, including comedian Eric Morecambe in 1979, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in 1988, and actor Omar Sharif in 1993.  Later career  He retired from the National Health Service in 2001 at the age of 65. In 2006 he led a complex operation which required removing a transplant heart from a person whose own heart had recovered. The original heart had not been removed during transplant surgery nearly a decade earlier, in the hope it might recover. In April 2007, it was reported that a British medical research team led by Yacoub had grown part of a human heart valve from stem cells. Charities In 1995, Yacoub founded the charity Of Ahmed Sherif \\"Chain of Hope\\", through which he continued to operate on children, and through which the provision of heart surgery for correctable heart defects are made possible in areas without specialist cardiac surgery units. He is also the head of the Magdi Yacoub Global Heart Foundation, co- founded with Ahmed Zewail and Ambassador Mohamed Shaker in 2008, which launched the Aswan Heart project and founded the Aswan Heart Centre the following year.

A revenue stamp, tax stamp, duty stamp or fiscal stamp is a (usually) adhesive label used to collect taxes or fees on documents, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, drugs and medicines, playing cards, hunting licenses, firearm registration, and many other things. Typically businesses purchase the stamps from the government, and attach them to taxed items as part of putting the items on sale, or in the case of documents, as part of filling out the form. Revenue stamps often look very similar to postage stamps, and in some countries and time periods it has been possible to use postage stamps for revenue purposes, and vice versa. Some countries also issued dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps.  Description  upright Revenue stamps are stamps used to collect taxes and fees. They are issued by governments, national and local, and by official bodies of various kinds. They take many forms and may be gummed and ungummed, perforated or imperforate, printed or embossed, and of any size. In many countries, they are as detailed in their design as banknotes; they are often made from the same type of paper. The high value of many revenue stamps means that they may contain security devices to prevent counterfeiting. The Revenue Society has defined revenue stamps as \\" ...stamps, whether impressed, adhesive or otherwise, issued by or on behalf of International, National or Local Governments, their Licensees or Agents, and indicate that a tax, duty or fee has been paid or prepaid or that permission has been granted.\\"Home.

Records of tax revenue from stamps for silk provide evidence of changes in silk production over time. The use of revenue stamps goes back further than that of postage stamps (first used in 1840); the stamps of the Stamp Acts of the 18th century were revenues.\\"The Stamp Act of 1765 - A Serendipitous Find\\" by Hermann Ivester in The Revenue Journal, The Revenue Society, Vol.XX, No.3, December 2009, pp.87-89. Their use became widespread in the 19th century, partly inspired by the success of the postage stamp, and partly motivated by the desire to streamline government operations, the presence of a revenue stamp being an indication that the item in question had already paid the necessary fees. Revenue stamps have become less commonly seen in the 21st century, with the rise of computerization and the ability to use numbers to track payments accurately. A 1922 Malta 1d stamp from the Melita issue which was valid for both postal and fiscal use. The strip of three on the left was postally used at Sliema, and the single on the right was fiscally used at an Anglo-Egyptian Bank branch There are a great many kinds of revenue stamps in the world, and it is likely that many remain unrecorded. Both national and local entities have issued them. Governments have sometimes combined the functions of postage and revenue stamps. In the former British Empire, such stamps were often inscribed \\"Postage and Revenue\\" to reflect their dual function. Other countries have simply allowed revenue stamps to be used for postage or vice versa. A revenue stamp authorized subsequently for postal use is known as a postal fiscal. Bhutan, for instance, authorized the use of revenue stamps for postal purposes from 1955 until the first proper postage stamps of the country were issued in 1962. In the Stanley Gibbons catalog, this type of stamp has an F prefix.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: Part 21 South-East Asia. 4th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2004, p. 1.  Methods of cancellation  upright While revenue stamps often resemble postage stamps, they are not normally intended for use on mail and therefore do not receive a postal cancellation. Some countries such as Great Britain have issued stamps valid for both postage and revenue, but this practice is now rare. Many different methods have been used to cancel revenue stamps, including pen cancels, inked handstamps, perforating, embossing, hole punching or simply tearing. From around 1900, United States revenue stamps were required to be mutilated by cutting, after being affixed to documents, and in addition to being cancelled in ink. A class of office equipment was created to achieve this which became known as \\"stamp mutilators\\". archived from the originalUnited States Patent for a \\"Stamp Mutilator\\", 1900. No. 653366.  Collecting  Revenue stamps were once widely collected by philatelists and given the same status as postage stamps in stamp catalogues and at exhibitions. After World War One, however, they declined in popularity, possibly due to being excluded from catalogues as the number of postage stamps issued rose rapidly and crowded revenues out. The lowest point in revenue philately was during the middle years of the twentieth century. A Stanley Gibbons children's stamp album from the 1950s warned in its introduction: \\"Since Philately is the collecting of stamps that are employed in connection with the Posts, do not put in your album fiscals, telegraph stamps, tobacco- tax labels and other such strange things as are often found in some collections.\\"\\"Stamp Collecting Hints\\" in Improved Postage Stamp Album. 28th edn. London: Stanley Gibbons, c. 1953, p. 3. This is not a definition of philately that would be recognised today. More recently, revenue philately has become popular again and now has its own FIP (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Philat√©lie) Commission and is an approved category in FIP endorsed stamp exhibitions.FIP REVENUE COMMISSION F√©d√©ration Internationale de Philat√©lie 2011.

Many catalogues have been issued by specialist publishers and dealers but revenue stamps still do not feature in some of the most popular catalogues, for instance by Stanley Gibbons and Michel, unless they are revenue and postage stamps. However, both the standard Scott and the Scott Specialised United States catalogue feature US revenue stamps. The leading catalogue for revenue stamps of the United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth and several European countries is the Barefoot Catalogue.  Some types of revenue stamps  1871 U.S. Revenue stamp for 1/6 Barrel of beer = Court fees = One of the earliest uses of revenue stamps was to pay Court Fees. Stamps were used in the Indian feudal states as early as 1797, almost 50 years before the first postal stamps.Court Fee and Revenue Stamps of the Princely States of India. Although India is only one of several countries that have used tax stamps on legal documents, it was one of the most prolific users. The practice is almost entirely stopped now, partly due to the prevalence of forgeries which cost the issuing government revenue.Court fee stamp racket busted, The Hindu, Sept. 10, 2003. = Documents = The tax on documents, also commonly known as stamp duty, is one of the oldest uses of revenue stamps, probably being invented in Spain, and introduced (or re- invented) in the Netherlands in the 1620s, then reaching France in 1651 and England in 1694.Dagnall, H.

For instance, the producer may buy stamps from the government which are then affixed to each bottle of alcohol or packet of cigarettes to show that tax has been paid.

Wodehouse. A member of the Drones Club affectionately known as \\"Freddie\\", he is the second son of Lord Emsworth, and a somewhat simple- minded youth who brings his father nothing but trouble. Freddie has one brother, George, and a sister, Mildred.  Life and character  Freddie's youth was a rather wild and reckless time. He was expelled from Eton for \\"breaking out at night and roaming the streets of Windsor in a false moustache\\", and was sent down from Oxford, where he had been good friends with \\"Beefy\\" Bingham, for \\"pouring ink from a second-storey window on the junior dean of his college\\". Despite two years at an expensive London crammer's, he failed to qualify for the army. During this time he gathered a wide circle of shady and dubious friends, mostly involved in the turf, including the unpleasant Mr. R Jones, and an equally broad set of gambling debts. When Lord Emsworth is required to pay off ¬£500 worth of said debts, Freddie is recalled to Blandings Castle, the family's traditional prison for straying youth, where he is kept for his own safety, despite the discomfort this causes his father; this is where we find him when we first meet Freddie, at the start of Something Fresh. Thin and of medium height, Freddie is an amiable chap, though not the sharpest of minds. He is fond of the cinema, and indeed at one point writes a film scenario, which he successfully sells to the Super-Ultra-Art Film Company for $1000. He is also a great lover of detective fiction, and is awed to meet Ashe Marson, creator of Gridley Quayle, Investigator. A fan of a pretty face, at some point in his London days he fell for a girl on the stage, Joan Valentine, and bombarded her with letters and poetry to little avail, a fact that threatens to cause some embarrassment when he becomes engaged to American heiress Aline Peters. This engagement, miraculous in the eyes of the family, comes to nothing, however, as Freddie invites George Emerson, Aline's other suitor, to Blandings, and loses her to him. Freddie's eye for a pretty girl is once again in evidence in Leave it to Psmith, where he is enamoured of Eve Halliday, another girl he loses to a better man, but in \\"The Custody of the Pumpkin\\" he woos and elopes with Aggie Donaldson, daughter of Donaldson the U.S. dog-biscuit king. He moves to America to work for his father-in-law, becoming a successful part of the Dog-Joy empire, only returning occasionally to attend weddings or to push his products in the English market. Freddie and Aggie (short for \\"Niagara\\", where her parents honeymooned) now live in Great Neck, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island. (Wodehouse himself lived in Great Neck for a time, beginning in 1918.)P.G. Wodehouse, Portrait of a Master, David Jasen. New York: Mason & Charter, 1974. Freddie's good fortune and business success changes his personality completely. When his father visits in the story \\"Birth of a Salesman\\", set three years after Freddie's marriage, Emsworth finds that \\"in those three years some miracle had transformed [Freddie] from a vapid young London lizard into a go-getter, a live wire and a man who thought on his feet and did it now.\\" Freddie talks of nothing but Donaldson's Dog Joy--its health benefits for the modern dog, and his own part in spreading the word to eager dog owners. Emsworth is rattled by the thought that \\"after years of regarding this child as a drone and a wastrel, the child as now regarding him as one. A world's worker himself, Freddie eyed with scorn one who, like Lord Emsworth, neither toiled nor spun... And if there is one thing that pierces the armour of an English father of the upper classes it is to be looked down on by his younger son.\\" Stung, Emsworth regains his confidence by helping a young woman sell richly bound encyclopedias of Sport door to door.\\"Birth of a Salesman\\". Collected in Nothing Serious. London: Herbert Jenkins, 1950.  Appearances  Freddie appears in four Blandings novels, and seven short stories: * Something Fresh (1915) * Leave it to Psmith (1923) * \\"The Custody of the Pumpkin\\" (1924, collected in Blandings Castle) * \\"Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best\\" (1926, collected in Blandings Castle) * \\"Company for Gertrude\\" (1928, collected in Blandings Castle) * \\"The Go-getter\\" (1931, collected in Blandings Castle) * Full Moon (1947) * \\"Birth of a Salesman\\" (1950, collected in Nothing Serious) * \\"Sticky Wicket at Blandings\\" (1966, collected in Plum Pie) * \\"Life with Freddie\\" (1966, not set at Blandings, collected in Plum Pie) * Sunset at Blandings (1977) Freddie is also mentioned briefly in the fourth chapter of the Jeeves novel The Code of the Woosters, in which Bertie Wooster refers to both Freddie and Blandings.\\"I saw her point. I recollected Freddie Threepwood telling me that there had been trouble at Blandings about a cousin of his wanting to marry a curate. In that case, I gathered, the strain had been eased by the discovery that the fellow was the heir of a well-to-do Liverpool shipping millionaire: but, as a broad, general rule, parents do not like their daughters marrying curates, and I take it that the same thing applies to uncles with their nieces.\\" The Code of the Woosters.

(photo 2009) Chart of historic Valjoux movements Valjoux (for Vall√©e de Joux, \\"Joux Valley\\") is a Swiss manufacturer of mechanical watch movements. It is known primarily for chronograph √©bauche movements that are used in a number of mid- to high-range mechanical watches. The company is a part of ETA, and is a member of the Swatch Group. Valjoux 7750 Valjoux is responsible for the design and manufacture of the Valjoux 7750 movement (and variants), an extremely popular movement used in many of mechanical chronograph watches. The Valjoux 7750 is different from most other chronograph movements, using the three-plane cam system rather than the column wheel. It is constructed of a mainplate, calendar plate, and chronograph top plate. Levers push a cam back and forth, driving the stopwatch mechanism of the Valjoux 7750. This is referred to as a coulisse-lever escapement. In the 1980s, many companies began using the Valjoux 7750 because it was easier to mass-produce and distribute in high-volume. The Valjoux 7750 can be created in several different displays, including adding or eliminating a date window or adding or subtracting a subdial. Watch companies can purchase the movement and alter it in house if they desire. Some watch brands that use base movements manufactured by Valjoux include Appella, Breitling, Christopher Ward, Cyma Watches, Dreyfuss & Co., Fortis, Gallet, Glycine, Hamilton Watch, IWC, Steinhart, Invicta Watch Group, Junghans, Longines, Mido, NIXON Inc., Omega, Oris, Panerai, Porsche Design, Sinn, TAG Heuer, Tissot, Tutima, Xezo and Zodiac Watches. There are also a large number of derivative chronograph movements based on the Valjoux 7750 base. These include ETA's own Valgranges, designed for larger watches, as well as the following third-party movements: * Alfred Rochat for Chronoswiss (C. 732 or C. 741, C 741 by Rochat) * Dreyfuss & Co.

It aired from October 13, 1996 to December 28, 1998, on Nickelodeon. It is notable for its use of live puppets with digitally animated backgrounds, and in its first season, for refashioning characters and themes from the original Dr. Seuss books into new stories that often retained much of the flavor of Dr. Seuss' own works. Format In many respects seasons one and two of the program are very different shows. The two seasons have completely different intro and outro credit sequences and songs reflecting their differing orientations. The virtual settings seen in this show are created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. =Season One= Each episode is a self-contained story based on Dr. Seuss characters such as Yertle the Turtle and Horton the Elephant. The unifying element is that the stories are introduced and commented on by The Cat in the Hat (performed by Bruce Lanoil) who serves as host of the show. Occasionally The Cat in the Hat himself appears in the episode, reprising his role as a bit of a trickster, as in his original eponymous books (ex. episode 1.6: \\"The Simplifier\\"). Season one is notable for hewing closely to many of the themes of the original Dr. Seuss stories which often had a strong moral overtone. As a result, some episodes have distinctly dark or sinister elements which, like some Dr. Seuss books, may not be appropriate for younger children.Seussville: Which Dr. Seuss Books Are Right for My Child? =Season Two= For season two the show was reworked along the lines of a more traditional children's program. The Cat in the Hat (now voiced by a much less gravelly sounding Martin P. Robinson) lives in a playhouse with his Little Cats A through Z and the often flustered Terrence McBird (performed by Anthony Asbury). Aside from the residents of the house there are usually visitors based on Dr. Seuss characters. Each episode revolves around a theme (such as family, health, art) and features one or two songs about the theme. The action shifts between The Cat in the Hat and what is going on in his playhouse and shorter related story interludes, which he shows to the audience by means of his \\"Wubbuloscope.\\" These story vignettes take place in various locations like: * Seussville ‚Äì A contemporary city where Sarah Hall Small and her family lives. * Jungle of Nool ‚Äì A jungle that is home to Horton the Elephant, Morton the Elephant-Bird, Jane Kangaroo, Junior Kangaroo, Yertle the Turtle, the Wickershams, and the Sneels. * Kingdom of Didd ‚Äì A Renaissance- like kingdom which is ruled by King Derwin. * Mount Crumpitt ‚Äì Home of the Grinch and his dog, Max. The tone of season two is much lighter, no doubt the result of bringing in a number of comedic writers such as Adam Felber and Mo Rocca. The Cat in the Hat is no longer a trickster and instead has assumed the role of a friendly and enthusiastic host who is helpful, nurturing and sweet. Although this revised format only lasted one season before the show ended, the format was recognizably previously featured in Jim Henson Productions' next children's program Bear in the Big Blue House which was aired on Disney Channel.

In the film, Redman and Method Man portray two cannabis users who are visited by the ghost of a deceased friend after smoking his ashes. The ghost helps with their exams, and they receive scholarships to Harvard University. The film received generally negative reviews from film critics. Plot Two underachieving pot smokers, Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman) are visited by the ghost of Silas's recent deceased friend Ivory (Chuck Deezy). Ivory was cremated and Silas used his ashes as fertilizer for a new batch of marijuana. While both are sitting in the parking lot before taking their \\"THC\\" (Testing for Higher Credentials, a parody of the SAT and an allusion to tetrahydrocannabinol) exams for college, Silas has his marijuana but no cigar while Jamal has a cigar but nothing left to smoke, leading them to team up in Silas's car. They soon discover that smoking Silas's new batch summons the ghost of the recently deceased Ivory, visible to just the two of them. Ivory tells them the test answers as they take the test and they both score perfect scores. Several dubious colleges offer the pair scholarships, but none of them are appealing. Eventually, Chancellor Huntley (Fred Willard) suggests the two apply to Harvard University. Once there, they meet Bart (Chris Elwood), captain of the rowing team, his girlfriend Lauren (Lark Voorhies), I Need Money (Al Shearer), and their roommates Jeffrey (Justin Urich) and Tuan (Trieu Tran). Once they are settled in, they visit Dean Carl Cain (Obba Babatund√©) who tells them that per the terms of their scholarship, they must maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in order to remain at Harvard, or else face expulsion. Jamal joins the rowing team hoping to outrank Bart. Silas enrolls in the botany class to develop his \\"herbal\\" skills. They both enroll in black history together, although there are two other classes in which they have enrolled alone. Throughout the first half of the school year, they pass every test with the help of Ivory. Silas continues to woo and study with Lauren, while Jamal dates the U.S. vice president's (Jeffrey Jones) daughter Jamie (Essence Atkins). Also during the first half of the semester, they pull pranks and steal, which angers Bart, Jeffrey (who is pledging for a Final Club), and Dean Cain. Things go downhill after Silas and Jamal's raucous Halloween party. At the party, Gerald (T. J. Thyne), the volunteer officer whose bicycle was stolen and crushed by I Need Money, steals and smokes the Ivory plant, leaving the pair without access to Ivory. Silas begins working on a truth serum for his Botany class, using plant extracts. Silas concludes that, if his experiment works, he will earn an A in Botany, and a guarantee of a next semester. His experiment fails numerous times. Before midterm examinations, Jamal suggests they go to a graveyard, dig up a \\"smart dead guy\\", and smoke his remains which they attempted to do so with John Quincy Adams. Whereas Silas suggests simply that they study hard for a few hours a day while high. They try Silas's plan, but it does not pan out, as they end up failing almost all of their midterm exams. Desperate to stay in Harvard, they try Jamal's plan, but it proves fruitless, as well. Meanwhile, Gerald, who has morphed into a complete stoner, sees Ivory during one of his binges, and, at Ivory's behest, returns the remnants of the Ivory plant to Jamal and Silas. Due to Gerald's abuse of the plant very little remains and Jamal and Silas continue to fail their classes, which pleases Dean Cain. With the last final exam approaching, Jamal and Silas resign themselves to give up. However, Jeffrey reminds Silas of his guarantee of another semester if he can successfully fix his truth serum experiment. Silas ultimately does, having found a solution in which the last of Ivory's leaves could be used to counteract nausea. Nonetheless, because of their low grades, Jamal and Silas do not receive an invitation to the Harvard Alumni party. Dean Cain, clearly thrilled with this result, tells Bart he does not have to worry about the pair showing up or staying in Harvard. However, that changes when Jamie invites them both as her dates, as her father is an alumnus. At the party, Silas makes things a bit more interesting by testing out his truth serum experiment, which proves successful. At Lauren's presentation at the alumni party of Benjamin Franklin's artifacts, she shocks everyone with her discovery: the artifacts turn out to be a bong. Ivory even shows up with Benjamin Franklin to confirm the bong's authenticity. Dean Cain is outraged by this finding, but the Chancellor decides that he has had it with the Dean and fires him. Jamal and Silas are proud that the serum worked, a celebration that was almost short- lived, as Dean Cain returns and unsuccessfully attempts to kill them both with an ax as revenge. He is eventually apprehended by Secret Service. At the end, Jamal and Silas are able to stay, Jamal and Jamie get approval of Jamie's father to date, and Lauren leaves Bart for Silas because Bart \\"can't satisfy her\\".

He concluded that it did not have enough material \\"to sustain its 91 minutes\\" but did have enough \\"low-grade laughs\\" for its target audience. Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Bob Graham noted that \\"It looks like a movie somebody hallucinated and put up on the screen\\". He praised some humorous scenes such as the exhumation of John Quincy Adams, but criticized an abrupt ending. Entertainment Weekly rated it third in their \\"Best Stoner Movie\\" top ten list. The movie also won the Stony Award for Best Stoner Movie in 2002.

In April 2013, Method Man told TMZ that the script was being written by Dustin Lee Abraham, who wrote the first one, but it all would depend on Universal if the film would happen. In November 2015, Redman stated How High 2 would be released in 2017. In 2017, there was a written script, confirmed by Matt \\"M-80\\" Markoff. Redman stated that the script is being \\"rewritten\\" because he did not like the script. He expects production to begin late 2017, early 2018. In November 2017, Redman said that if the draft is not as funny as the original draft, he and Method Man would move on to something other than the sequel. Redman has confirmed that him and Method Man are not reprising their roles in the sequel because \\"the business wasn't right\\".https://www.instagram.com/p/BovDn52HOCS/ The sequel has been greenlit by MTV and Universal 1440 Entertainment as of June 25, 2018. The film takes place in Atlanta. Production started as of September 25, 2018. The film stars Lil' Yachty and DC Young Fly. It was released on DVD, Blu-ray and Digital HD in 2019. On March 7, 2019, MTV announced that the film How High 2 would premiere on April 20, 2019, 420 Day, and that Mike Epps would reprise as Baby Powder. They also released the opening credits sequence.

During the American Civil War he served as a Confederate general, and his Tredegar Iron Company was a major source of munitions and ordnance for the Confederate States Army. Starting with a small forge and rolling mill in the mid-1830s, It was a flourishing operation by 1843 when he leased it. He eventually bought the company outright in 1848 and forcefully and aggressively built Tredegar Iron Works into the South's largest and most significant iron works. When the Civil War broke out he entered the Army as a Brigadier General in 1861. Shortly after he was wounded and then resigned from the Army returning to the iron works. It was the Confederacy's major (and for much of the war only) source of cannons and munitions, employing some 900 workers, most of whom were slaves. His plant was confiscated by the Union army at the end of the war, but returned to him in 1867 and he remained president until his death. Anderson was very active in local civic and political affairs. Early and family life Joseph Reid Anderson was born at \\"Walnut Hill\\" near Fincastle, the county seat of Botetourt County, Virginia in 1813. The grandson of Scotch- Irish immigrants, he was the son of Colonel William Anderson (1764‚Äì1839) and Anne (n√©e Thomas) Anderson. The elder Anderson had served in the American Revolutionary War, and was also a colonel of a Virginia regiment in the War of 1812. Joseph's father was a self-taught engineer and surveyor and was later responsible for the building of the turnpike that is now U.S. Route 220 and (for part of the way) U.S. Route 60 from Fincastle to Covington. Col. Anderson's son was to follow in similar work. Joseph was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduated 4th in his class in 1836. Anderson married Sara Eliza Archer, daughter of Dr. Robert Archer, the post surgeon at Fort Monroe at the entrance to Hampton Roads in Elizabeth City County, Virginia. Seeking better prospects than army life promised, in 1837, he resigned to work as a civil engineer with Virginia State Engineer Claudius Crozet, who had earlier been a professor of engineering at West Point. Under the Virginia Board of Public Works, Anderson became Assistant State Engineer and served was chief engineer of the Valley Turnpike Company, a toll road which extended between Staunton and Winchester, Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley from 1838 until 1841. Early military and political careers In recognition of his engineering abilities, Anderson was assigned as an assistant engineer in the Engineer Bureau in Washington before being officially transferred to the United States Army Corps of Engineers on July 1, 1837, as a brevet second lieutenant. His primary duty with the Corps of Engineers was in the construction of Fort Pulaski to guard the Port of Savannah, Georgia. In 1841, Anderson joined the Tredegar Iron Company in Richmond, Virginia, eventually becoming its owner in 1848. By 1860, he was a leading industrialist in the South and his foundry on the James River was one of the largest in the United States, producing steam locomotives, boilers, cables, naval hardware, and cannon. In 1852, delegate William C. Carrington, who represented Richmond in the Virginia General Assembly. Anderson won the special election to succeed him, and would be re-elected several times.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978) p. 451, 456, 466 He served initially alongside William F. Butler and Conway Robinson, and after A. Judson Crane resigned, alongside George N. Johnson. He was re-elected in 1853, but his fellow delegates became James A. Cowarding and Henry K. Ellyson. He failed to win election to the assembly of 1855-56, but did win election to the House of Delegates again in 1857, this time serving with Roscoe B. Heath and Richard O. Haskins. Civil War When the Civil War came, the Tredegar Iron Company emerged as the industrial heart of the Confederate States of America. Using slave and free labor, Anderson supervised ordnance and munitions production through most of the war. Anderson, a supporter of southern secession and states' rights, was commissioned a major of artillery in August 1861, and promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate Army on September 3. Initially assigned to command the Confederate forces at Wilmington, North Carolina, in April 1862, he was reassigned to the area around Fredericksburg, Virginia, opposite Union Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell. With the mounting threat to Richmond during the Peninsula Campaign, Anderson was placed in command of the 3rd Brigade in A.P. Hill's newly formed \\"Light Division.\\" During the Seven Days Battles, he led his brigade at Mechanicsville, Gaines Mill, and Glendale, where he received a concussion from being hit in the head by a spent musket ball. Anderson was left disoriented and confused by the incident and spent the next few weeks recovering. General Anderson resigned his army commission on July 19, 1862, and served the Confederate war effort in the Ordnance Department until the evacuation of Richmond on the night of April 2‚Äì3, 1865. As the retreating Confederate troops burned many of the munitions dumps and industrial warehouses that would have been valuable to the North, Anderson reportedly paid over fifty armed guards to protect the Tredegar facility from arsonists. As a result, the Tredegar Iron Works is one of few Civil War era buildings in the warehouse district that survived the burning of Richmond. Postbellum activities Engraving of Anderson from an 1886 book on Richmond industries. During the Federal occupation of Richmond, the U.S. government had confiscated the Tredegar Iron Company's property, but Anderson regained control in 1867 and remained a prominent Virginia businessman as its president. His son, Archer Anderson, became involved in the business, and became president of the Tredegar Iron Works after his father's death. Another son Joseph Reid Anderson, went to the Virginia Military Institute after the Civil War and later taught there; and is considered to be the \\"Second Founder\\" of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Anderson was elected again to the Virginia House of Delegates to represent Richmond in 1873, this time serving alongside William S. Gilman, William Lovenstein, James H. Dooley and Robert Ould, although he failed to win re-election two years later. His final term in the House of Delegates was from 1877-1879, when he served alongside Samuel H. Pulliam, George K. Crutchfield, W. W. Henry and B. C. Gray.Leonard pp. 519, 527 After his wife Sara died in 1881, Anderson remarried. His second wife was Mary Evans Pegram, making him a brother-in-law to Confederate General John Pegram and Colonel William Ransom Johnson Pegram, both of whom had been killed during the war. Joseph Reid Anderson died while on a vacation at the Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire. It was widely reported that 30,000 citizens came to his funeral when he was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. Honors Today, Anderson's former Tredegar Iron Works facility overlooking the James River near downtown Richmond is the site of the main Visitor's Center of the Richmond National Battlefield Park, as well as another museum.

History The name may originate . Alternatively, it is speculated that the fabric now known as gingham may have been made at Guingamp, a town in Brittany, France, and that the fabric may be named after the town. Some sources say that the name came into English via Dutch.American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language When originally imported into Europe in the 17th century, gingham was a striped fabric, though now it is distinguished by its checkered pattern. From the mid-18th century, when it was being produced in the mills of Manchester, England, it started to be woven into checked or plaid patterns (often blue and white). Checked gingham became more common over time, though striped gingham was still available in the late Victorian period. The equivalent in the French language is the noun vichy, from the town of Vichy in France.  Use  Along with muslin, gingham is often used as a test fabric while designing fashion or used for making an inexpensive fitting shell prior to making the clothing in fashion fabric. Gingham shirts have been worn by mods since the 1960s and continue to be identified with fans of indie and mod music with brands like Lambretta Clothing, Ben Sherman, Fred Perry, Penguin and Merc producing gingham shirts. In the United Kingdom, the gingham pattern is often used for younger girls' school uniforms.

He donated vast land properties for the well-being of the people. He was interested in the well-being and protection of birds and animal life. He spent a large quantity of his money on those lives. The 12 June 1897 Assam earthquake was one of the biggest earthquakes that occurred in the Assam and Sylhet area. The largest known Indian interpolate earthquake (at 8.0 on the moment magnitude scale) resulted in the destruction of structures over much of the Plateau and surrounding areas, and caused widespread liquefaction and flooding in the Brahmaputra and Sylhet floodplains. He found out many of his kin and relatives as well as his people wounded and killed. His thatched house was fully damaged. He lost many of his tamed birds and animals.Khan Bahadur Dewan Ganiur Raja, \\"Din Panjika\\" Manuscript Diary, Sunamganj, 1932 =Death= Raja died on 6 December 1922.

Due to an influx of immigrants and guest workers from non-Muslim countries, such as India, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the overall percentage of Muslims in the country has declined since the late 20th century. Bahrain's 2010 census indicated that 70.2% of the population is Muslim. The last official census (1941) to include sectarian identification reported 52% (88,298 citizens) as Shia and 48 per cent as Sunni of the Muslim population.Qubain, Fahim Issa (1955) ‚ÄúSocial Classes and Tensions in Bahrain.‚Äù The Middle East Journal 9, no. 3: 269‚Äì280, p. 270 History The Khamis Mosque in 1956. Prior to Islam, the inhabitants of Qatar and Bahrain practiced Arabian paganism, worshipping idols. Islam swept the entire Arabian region in the 7th century. Muhammad sent his first envoy Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami to Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi, the ruler of the historical region of Bahrain, which extended the coast from Kuwait to the south of Qatar including Al-Hasa, Qatif, and the Bahrain Islands, in the year 628 AD, inviting him to Islam. Munzir announced his conversion to Islam and all the Arab inhabitants of Bahrain and Qatar including some Persians living in Qatar also became Muslim, heralding the beginning of the Islamic era in Bahrain. The origins of Shia Islam in Bahrain can be traced back to 656-661 AD, the caliphate reign of Ali ibn Abi Talib. The prophet Muhammed appointed Aban Ibn Sa'id Al As () as governor of Bahrain during his lifetime. Aban was a major supporter of Ali's right to the caliphate, a position that was endorsed by the inhabitants of Bahrain including the influential Bani Abdul Qays tribe. The Khamis Mosque is believed to be the oldest mosque in Bahrain, with its origin dating back to the reign of Caliph Umar II. The letter sent by Muhammad to Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi, the governor of Bahrain at the time. The Ismaili Shia sect known at the Qarmatians seized Bahrain in 899 AD, making it their stronghold and base of operations. They raided Baghdad and in 930 sacked Mecca and Medina, desecrating the Zamzam Well with the bodies of Hajj pilgrim and taking the Black Stone with them back to Bahrain where it remained for twenty years. The Qarmatians were eventually defeated by their Ismaili counterparts, the Abbasids in 976 and afterwards their power waned. The defeat of the Qarmatian state saw the gradual wane of their revolutionary brand of Ismaili Islam. Instead, under a process encouraged by Sunni rulers over the next four hundred years, Twelver Shia Islam became entrenched. According to historian Juan Cole, Sunnis favoured the quietist Twelver branch of Shi'ism over the Qarmatians and promoted its development in Bahrain.Juan Cole, Sacred Space and Holy War, IB Tauris, 2007 pp32 In the 13th Century, there arose what was termed the 'Bahrain School', which integrated themes of philosophy and mysticism into orthodox Twelver practise. The school produced theologians such as Sheikh Kamal al-Din Ibn Sa‚Äôadah al Bahrani (d. 1242), Sheikh Jamal al-Din ‚ÄòAli --- ibn Sulayman al-Bahrani (d. 1271), and perhaps most famously Sheikh Maitham Al Bahrani (d. 1280).Ali Al Oraibi, Rationalism in the school of Bahrain: a historical perspective, in Shƒ´ ªite Heritage: Essays on Classical and Modern Traditions by Lynda Clarke, Global Academic Publishing 2001, p. 331 Today Unofficial sources, such as the Library of Congress Country Studies,Bahrain Country Study Library of Congress and The New York Times,1981 Plot in Bahrain linked to Iranians New York Times, 25 July 1982, retrieved 20 June 2018 estimate sectarian identification to be approximately 45% Sunni and 55% Shia.

In the 2006 election Wefaq received the backing of the Islamic Scholars Council which helped it seventeen of the eighteen seats it contested. In the 2010 election, they increased their representation by one seat, winning all the constituencies they contested, to take 18 of the 40 available parliamentary seats.Independents the biggest winners - Gulf Daily News, 1 Nov 2010 Since then, Shias have no representatives in the Bahraini rubber stamp parliament. The government has made concerted efforts to erode the Shiite citizen majority and tip the country's demographic balance in favor of the Sunni minority, mostly by recruiting foreign-born Sunnis to serve in the security forces and become citizens. Meanwhile, hundreds of Bahrainis have had their citizenship revoked in recent years, including a number of Shiite leaders and activists. Since 2011, the government has maintained a heavy security presence in primarily Shiite villages.

His work was the driving force behind many national and international weather initiatives and programs. Considered the father of modern dynamical meteorology, Charney is credited with having \\"guided the postwar evolution of modern meteorology more than any other living figure.\\"Biography of Jule Charney at American Geophysical UnionNational Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir of Jule Charney Charney's work also influenced that of his close colleague Edward Lorenz, who explored the limitations of predictability and was a pioneer of the field of chaos theory. Biography Charney was born in San Francisco, California, on January 1, 1917, to Russian immigrants Ely Charney and Stella Littman, tailors in the garment industry. Charney spent most of his early life in California. After a 20-month battle with cancer, he died in Boston at the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute at the age of 64. Education Charney earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees at UCLA, culminating in a Ph.D. in physics in 1946. His Ph.D. dissertation, titled ‚ÄúThe Dynamics of Long Waves in a Baroclinic Westerly Current‚Äù comprised the entire October 1947 issue of the Journal of Meteorology. The paper was influential because it emphasized the influence of ‚Äúlong waves‚Äù in the upper atmosphere on the behavior of the entire atmosphere rather than the more traditional emphasis on the polar front and also provided a way of analyzing perturbations along these waves that was both physically insightful and mathematically rigorous. Career and legacy Charney began his career at his alma mater, UCLA, as an instructor in physics and meteorology from 1941 to 1946. In 1946, Charney became a research associate at the University of Chicago under Carl-Gustav Rossby, a Swedish-born American meteorologist whose theories of large-scale air movements helped revolutionize meteorology. From 1947 to 1948, Charney held a National Research Council postgraduate fellowship at the University of Oslo in Norway. During this year, he developed a technique known as the ‚Äúquasi-geostrophic approximation‚Äù for calculating the large-scale motions of planetary-scale waves. Charney's quasi- geostrophic vorticity equations allowed for concise mathematical description of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations, enabling future numerical weather prediction work. =Numerical weather prediction= In 1948, Charney joined the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, to explore the feasibility of applying digital computers to weather prediction as head of the Meteorological Research Group. Together with noted mathematician John von Neumann, Charney helped pioneer the use of computers and numerical techniques to improve weather forecasting, and played a leading role in efforts to integrate sea-air exchanges of energy and moisture into the study of climate. This collective work paved the way for the founding of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. In 1954, Charney helped create the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit, a collaboration between the U.S. Weather Bureau, Air Force, and Navy. Charney would later served as a member of the Committee on Atmospheric Sciences of the National Academy of Sciences and as chairman of the academy's Committee on International Meteorological Cooperation. In those roles, he conceived and helped organize the Global Atmospheric Research Program, considered the most ambitious international effort in weather research ever undertaken. =Dynamic meteorology and oceanography= In 1956, Charney left IAS to become a professor of meteorology and director of the Atmospheric and Ocean Dynamics Project at MIT, where for 25 years he contributed major contributions in dynamic meteorology and oceanography research, including large-scale atmospheric turbulence, feedback interactions between the oceans and atmosphere, the persistence of certain abnormal flow patterns in the atmosphere, and the relationship of such phenomena to droughts. Among his many fundamental contributions to the field, Charney identified ‚Äúbaroclinic instability,‚Äù the first convincing physical explanation for the development of mid-latitude cyclones. Charney identified the mechanism that explains the size, structure, and growth rate of mid- latitude weather systems, and is a ubiquitous phenomenon in rotating, stratified fluids like our oceans and atmosphere. From 1974 to 1977, Charney headed the meteorology department at MIT. In addition to his revolutionizing research, Charney is remembered as a charismatic and optimistic professor among former students from MIT, where he remained until his death in 1981. Students describe falling into ‚Äúorbit around the Charney sun.‚Äù There is a library named in Charney's honor in the building that holds the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheres and Planetary Sciences. =Charney Report= In 1979, Charney chaired an \\"ad hoc study group on carbon dioxide and climate\\" for the National Research Council. The resulting 22-page report, \\"Carbon dioxide and climate: A scientific assessment,\\" is one of the earliest modern scientific assessments about global warming. Its main conclusion can be found on page 2: \\"We estimate the most probable global warming for a doubling of CO2 to be near 3¬∞C with a probable error of ¬± 1.5¬∞C.\\" This estimate of climate sensitivity has been essentially unchanged for over three decades, e.g., the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007) says that \\"equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely to be in the range 2¬∞C to 4.5¬∞C, with a best estimate value of about 3¬∞C. It is very unlikely to be less than 1.5¬∞C. Values substantially higher than 4.5¬∞C cannot be excluded, but agreement with observations is not as good for those values.\\" =Centenary celebration= In February 2018, MIT held a symposium, named MIT on Chaos and Climate, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Charney and Edward Lorenz. The two-day event featured presentations from world-renowned experts on the many scientific contributions that the two pioneers made on the fields of numerical weather prediction, physical oceanography, atmospheric dynamics, and experimental fluid dynamics, as well as the personal legacy they left behind of integrity, optimism, and collaboration. In one presentation, Joseph Pedlosky, scientist emeritus at the Woods Hole Oceanography Institute and world leader in physical oceanography, said this of his friend and mentor Jules Charney: > \\"It's fair to say that Jule Charney turned the mystery of the erratic > behavior of the atmosphere into a recognizable‚Äìalthough very, very > difficult‚Äìproblem in fluid physics. I would like, however, to talk today > about Jule's more personal and I think equally vital contribution to our > field, in terms of the inspiring generosity of spirit he showed that > advanced the atmosphere of collaborative collegiality in our field. He set a > standard for personal and scientific integrity that I think is often > overlooked but of exceptional importance.\\" A video produced for the event highlights the indelible mark made by Charney and Lorenz on MIT and the field of meteorology as a whole.

This tactic was pioneered during World War I by the London Air Defence Area organization, which became the Royal Air Force's Dowding system in World War II, the first national-scale system. The Luftwaffe introduced similar systems during the war, but most other combatants did not suffer the same threat of air attack and did not develop complex systems like these until the Cold War era. Today the term GCI refers to the style of battle direction, but during WWII it also referred to the radars themselves. Specifically, the term was used to describe a new generation of radars that spun on their vertical axis in order to provide a complete 360 degree view of the sky around the station. Previous systems, notably Chain Home (CH), could only be directed along angles in front of the antennas, and were unable to direct traffic once it passed behind their shore-side locations. GCI radars began to replace CH starting in 1941/42, allowing a single station to control the entire battle from early detection to directing the fighters to intercept. GCI systems grew in size and sophistication during the post-war era, in response to the overwhelming threat of nuclear attack. The US' SAGE system was perhaps the most complex attempted, using building-filling computers linked to dozens of radars and other sensors to automate the entire task of identifying an enemy aircraft's track and directing interceptor aircraft or surface-to-air missiles against it. In some cases, SAGE sent commands directly to the aircraft's autopilots, bringing the aircraft within attack range entirely under computer control. The RAF counterpart, ROTOR remained a mostly manual system. Today, GCI is still important for most nations, although Airborne Early Warning and Control, with or without support from GCI, generally offers much greater range due to the much more distant radar horizon. British Chain Home Radar Coverage 1939-1940 World War II The restored Operations Room in the underground bunker at RAF Uxbridge showing the map and plotters and with the RAF Station names and readiness status boards on the wall behind. Also shown is the Sector clock In the original Dowding system of fighter control, information from the Chain Home coastal radar stations was relayed by phone to a number of operators on the ground floor of the \\"filter room\\" at Fighter Command's headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory. Here the information from the radar was combined with reports from the Royal Observer Corps and radio direction finding systems and merged to produce a single set of \\"tracks\\", identified by number. These tracks were then telephoned to the Group headquarters that would be responsible for dealing with that target. Group would assign fighter squadrons to the tracks, and phone the information to Section headquarters, who were in direct contact with the fighters. These fighter aircraft could then be \\"scrambled\\" to intercept the aircraft. Because the Chain Home radar stations faced out to sea, once airborne intruders had crossed the British coast they could no longer be tracked by radar; and accordingly the interception direction centres relied on visual and aural sightings of the Observer Corps for continually updated information on the location and heading of enemy aircraft formations. While this arrangement worked acceptably during the daylight raids of the Battle of Britain, subsequent bombing attacks of The Blitz demonstrated that such techniques were wholly inadequate for identifying and tracking aircraft at night. Experiments in addressing this problem started with manually directed radars being used as a sort of radio-searchlight, but this proved too difficult to use in practice. Another attempt was made by using a height finding radar turned on its side in order to scan an arc in front of the station. This proved very workable, and was soon extended to covering a full 360 degrees by making minor changes to the support and bearing systems. Making a display system, the \\"Plan Position Indicator\\" (PPI), that displayed a 360 degree pattern proved surprisingly easy, and test systems were available by late 1940. Starting in 1941 the RAF began deploying production models of the GCI radar, first with expedient solutions, and then permanent stations. Unlike the earlier system where radar data was forwarded by telephone and plotted on a map, GCI radars combined all of these functions into a single station. The PPI was in the form of a 2D top-down display showing both the targets and the intercepting night fighters. Interceptions could be arranged directly from the display, without any need to forward the information over telephone links or similar. This not only greatly eased the task of arranging the interception, but greatly reduced the required manpower as well. As the system became operational the success of the RAF night fighter force began to shoot up. This was further aided by the introduction of the Bristol Beaufighter and its AI Mk. IV radar which became available in numbers at the same time. These two systems proved to be a potent combination, and interception rates doubled every month from January 1941 until the Luftwaffe campaign ended in May. The Germans were quite slow to follow in terms of PPI and did not order operational versions of their Jagdschloss radar until late in 1943, with deliveries being relatively slow after that. Many were still under construction when the war ended in 1945. Post WWII More recently, in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, the North Koreans and North Vietnamese had important GCI systems which helped them harass the opposing forces (although in both cases due to the superiority in the number of US planes the effect was eventually minimised ). GCI was important to the US and allied forces during these conflicts also, although not so much as for their opponents. The most advanced GCI system deployed to date was the US's Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system. SAGE used massive computers to combine reports sent in via teleprinter from the Pinetree Line and other radar networks to produce a picture of all of the air traffic in a particular \\"sector\\"s area. The information was then displayed on terminals in the building, allowing operators to pick defensive assets (fighters and missiles) to be directed onto the target simply by selecting them on the terminal. Messages would then automatically be routed back out via teleprinter with instructions on them. SAGE Long Range Radar Stations are described in the On-line Radar Museum. See radomes.org/museum The system was later upgraded to relay directional information directly to the autopilots of the interceptor aircraft like the F-106 Delta Dart. The pilot was tasked primarily with getting the aircraft into the air (and back), and then flying in a parking orbit until called for. When an interception mission started, the SAGE computers automatically flew the plane into range of the target, allowing the pilot to concentrate solely on operating the complex onboard radar. GCI is typically augmented with the presence of extremely large early warning radar arrays, which could alert GCI to inbound hostile aircraft hours before they arrive, giving enough time to prepare and launch aircraft and set them up for an intercept either using their own radars or with the assistance of regular radar stations once the bogeys approach their coverage. An example of this type of system is Australia's Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. Such radars typically operate by bouncing their signal off layers in the atmosphere. Airborne Early Warning and Control In more recent years, GCI has been supplanted, or replaced outright, with the introduction of Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C;, often called AWACS) aircraft. AEW&C; tends to be superior in that, being airborne and being able to look down, it can see targets fairly far away at low level, as long as it can pick them out from the ground clutter. AEW&C; aircraft are extremely expensive, however, and generally require aircraft to be dedicated to protecting them. A combination of both techniques is really ideal, but GCI is typically only available in the defence of one's homeland, rather than in expeditionary types of battles. The strengths of GCI are that it can cover far more airspace than AEW&C; without costing as much and areas that otherwise would be blind-spots for AEW&C; can be covered by cleverly placed radar stations. AEW&C; also relies on aircraft which may require defence and a few aircraft are more vulnerable than many ground-based radar stations. If a single AEW&C; aircraft is shot down or otherwise taken out of the picture, there will be a serious gap in air defence until another can replace it, where in the case of GCI, many radar stations would have to be taken off the air before it became a serious problem. In both cases a strike on a command center could be very serious. Either GCI or AEW&C; can be used to give defending aircraft a major advantage during the actual interception by allowing them to sneak up on enemy aircraft without giving themselves away by using their own radar sets. Typically, to perform an interception by themselves beyond visual range, the aircraft would have to search the sky for intruders with their radars, the energy from which might be noticed by the intruder's radar warning receiver (RWR) electronics, thus alerting the intruders that they may be coming under attack. With GCI or AEW&C;, the defending aircraft can be vectored to an interception course, perhaps sliding in on the intruder's tail position without being noticed, firing passive homing missiles and then turning away. Alternatively, they could turn their radars on at the final moment, so that they can get a radar lock and guide their missiles. This greatly increases the interceptor's chance of success and survival.

After the events, Chinese liaisons are sent to France to investigate the matter, as Richard makes Liu the primary suspect. However, the liaisons do not believe the story Richard provides. Liu meets with one of them on a ferry and passes him the tape, revealing the truth. However, Richard's men spot them, and the liaison is assassinated. Liu is then forced to flee from a horde of cops, and even, GIGN commandos. After Liu escapes, he is forced to maintain a low profile. As he considers his situation, he meets Jessica, whose daughter was kidnapped by Richard to force her into prostitution. Liu recognizes that Jessica was the second prostitute at the hotel during the night of Mr. Big's murder. He realizes she can prove his innocence, but she refuses to go without retrieving her daughter, Isabel (Isabelle Duhauvelle). Liu decides the tape would provide the best evidence, and sends Jessica to Richard's office to steal the tape. Jessica manages to get the tape, so Liu and Jessica head to an orphanage where Isabel is kept. However, Richard anticipates this move, and ambushes the couple at the orphanage. During their escape, Jessica is shot in the chest. Liu manages to get her to the hospital in time, and becomes driven to retrieve her daughter. Liu arrives at the police station where Richard is holding Isabel hostage, fighting his way through another horde of Richard's police and personal henchmen to his office, where Liu finds him holding Isabel as gunpoint. Even though Liu is unarmed, he tells Richard that he can kill him in the same amount of time that it would take for him to kill Isabel. Richard takes the bait, shooting at Liu, managing to hit him in the shoulder. However, the bullet injury fails to prevent Liu from disarming Richard while sticking an acupuncture needle into the back of his neck - in a forbidden location known as the \\"kiss of the dragon,\\" which stimulates all the body's blood to travel to the brain to cause a painful death by brain aneurysm. Richard ends up suffering this Kiss of The Dragon death just as Liu departs with Isabel. Returning to Jessica's hospital bedside, Liu removes an acupuncture needle from Jessica's neck, promptly waking her, where she finds Isabel peacefully sleeping on the nearby sofa. Origin of title The title \\"Kiss of the Dragon\\" is derived from one of the last scenes in the movie, in which Liu punctures Richard in the back of the neck with an acupuncture needle at a \\"very forbidden\\" point on the body. The puncture itself, called \\"kiss of the dragon\\", traps all the body's blood in the head and causes side effects of quadriplegia, bleeding from the head's orifices, and a painful death by brain aneurysm.

Wire work was added to one of the last fight sequences between Li and Cyril Raffaelli, in order to add clarity to Raffaelli's kicks, as he was moving too fast for the camera. Nahon had to slow down this fight scene, as both Li and Raffaelli were moving too quickly to be captured clearly at normal recording speed. The French version of the film is notably different from others; it contains a zoomed-out shot of Tcheky Karyo shooting one of his henchmen in the head, resulting in a fountain of blood erupting. This passage was cropped from most international versions of the movie. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics, who thought violence overwhelmed it at the expense of the story and even a true portrayal of martial arts. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 51% based on reviews from 107 critics. The site's consensus states \\"A formulaic actioner that's sure to please action fans. Those looking for plot, believability, or character development will have difficulty finding them.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 26 critic reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and wrote: \\"I like the movie on a simple physical level. There is no deeper meaning and no higher skill involved; just professional action, well-staged and filmed with a certain stylistic elegance.\\" The film is based on a story by Li, and is one of Fonda's final on- screen appearances before her retirement from acting. Due to its violence, Kiss of the Dragon was banned in China. Li spoke out about this censorship. Box office Kiss of the Dragon opened at 2,025 North American theaters on July 6, 2001 to an opening weekend gross of $13,304,027 ($6,569 per screen). It went on to a total North American gross of $36,845,124, making the film to be very profitable for 20th Century Fox (which only paid slightly more than $12.5 million to acquire the distribution rights in North America and some other foreign territories). Its total worldwide box office gross is $64,437,847. Soundtrack The soundtrack was released on July 3, 2001 through Virgin Records, and consisted mainly of a blend of hip hop and electronic music. # \\"Mystikal Fever\\" ‚Äì 3:49 (Mystikal) # \\"Lapdance\\" ‚Äì 3:33 (N.E.R.D) # \\"Aerodynamic\\" ‚Äì 3:35 (Daft Punk and Slum Village) # \\"Fuck That\\" ‚Äì 3:17 (Bathgate) # \\"What You Got?\\" ‚Äì 4:19 (Chino XL) # \\"Sing\\" ‚Äì 4:41 (Mouse) # \\"Cheatin'\\" ‚Äì 3:46 (Liberty City) # \\"Don't Blame It on I\\" ‚Äì 4:05 (The Congos) # \\"Ghir Dini\\" ‚Äì 3:59 (Assia) # \\"As If You Said Nothing\\" ‚Äì 4:38 (Craig Armstrong) # \\"Adore You\\" ‚Äì 4:21 (Lisa Barbuscia) References External links 2001 films 2001 action thriller films 2001 martial arts films 2000s chase films American action thriller films American films English-language films EuropaCorp films Films set in Paris French action thriller films French films Films about organized crime in France Films produced by Luc Besson Films scored by Craig Armstrong (composer) 20th Century Fox films StudioCanal films English-language French films 2001 directorial debut films ","title":"Kiss of the Dragon"},{"id":"1374023","text":"Herman Bang in his younger years Herman Joachim Bang (20 April 1857 ‚Äì 29 January 1912) was a Danish journalist and author, one of the men of the Modern Breakthrough. Biography Bang was born in Asserballe, on the small Danish island of Als, the son of a South Jutlandic vicar (a relative of N. F. S. Grundtvig). His family history was marked by insanity and disease. When he was twenty he published two volumes of critical essays on the realistic movement. In 1880 he published his novel Haabl√∏se Sl√¶gter (Families Without Hope), which aroused immediate attention. The main character was a young man who had a relationship with an older woman. The book was considered obscene at the time and was banned. After some time spent in travel and a successful lecture tour of Norway and Sweden, he settled in Copenhagen and produced a series of novels and collections of short stories which placed him in the front rank of Scandinavian novelists. Among his more famous stories are \\"F√¶dra\\" (1883) and \\"Tine\\" (\\"Tina\\", 1889). The latter won for its author the friendship of Henrik Ibsen and the enthusiastic admiration of Jonas Lie. Among his other works are Det hvide Hus (The White House, 1898), Excentriske Noveller (Eccentric Stories, 1885), Stille Eksistenser (Quiet Existences, 1886), Liv og D√∏d (Life and Death, 1899), Englen Michael (The Angel Michael, 1902), a volume of poems (1889), and recollections, Ti Aar (Ten Years, 1891). Bang was homosexual, a fact which contributed to his isolation in the cultural life of Denmark and made him the victim of smear campaigns. He lived most of his life with his sister, but spent a few years living in Prague in 1885‚Äì86, with the German actor Max Eisfeld (1863‚Äì1935). Uninterested in politics, he was distant from most of his colleagues in the naturalist movement. Failed as an actor, Bang earned fame as a theatre producer in Paris and in Copenhagen. He was a very productive journalist, writing for Danish, Nordic and German newspapers, developing modern reporting. His article on the fire at Christiansborg Palace is a landmark in Danish journalism. Bang is primarily concerned with \\"quiet existences\\", the disregarded and ignored people living boring and apparently unimportant lives. He is especially interested in describing lonely or isolated women. Ved Vejen (Katinka, 1886) describes the secret and never fulfilled passion of a young wife of a stationmaster, living in a barren marriage. Tine (1889), which has the war with Prussia in 1864 (the Second War of Schleswig) as background, tells the tragic love story of a young girl on the island of Als. Stuk (Stucco, 1887) recounts a young man's love affair that is fading away without any real explanation, against the background of the \\"Gr√ºnderzeit\\" of Copenhagen and its superficial modernization and economic speculation. In Ludvigsbakke (1896) a young nurse squanders her love on a spineless childhood friend, who eventually deserts her, in order to save his estate by marrying a rich heiress. Some of his books, including Tina and Katinka (English titles), have been translated into many languages and filmed. Bang's 1902 novel Mika√´l, based on the life of Auguste Rodin,Mark Nash, Dreyer BFI Publishing (October 1977). p. 7 proved especially popular for adaptations in the silent era, having been made into two films: 1916's The Wings, directed by Mauritz Stiller, and 1924's Michael, directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. Bang's works earned him renown as a leading European impressionist writer. Bang's last years were embittered by persecutions and declining health. He traveled widely in Europe, and during a lecture tour of the United States he was taken ill on the train and died in Ogden, Utah.

It is located 190 km (120 mi) west of Yangon on the bank of the Pathein River (Pathein), which is a western branch of the Irrawaddy River, the city has a population of 237,089 (2017 census). Although once part of the Mon kingdom, Pathein has few ethnic Mon residents today. The majority are of Bamar, Burmese Indians and Karen ethnicity. There are, however, notable minority Rakhine. Etymology The city's name is believed to derive from the Old Mon name, ().Dictionary of Modern Spoken Mon by H.L. Shorto (1962, Oxford University Press) \\"pha\\" means great or wide and sƒ´/s…õm means river or sea. Pha-s…õm means a big sea. The name was corrupted to Bassein during the British colonial period. An alternate theory holds that the city's name comes from the classical name of Pathein, Kusimanagara, a name used by ancient writings and the Kalyani inscriptions. Pathein itself is a corruption of Mon \\"Kuthen,\\" which itself is a contraction of Kusimanagara. This is supported by the fact that the Portuguese call Pathein \\"Cosmim.\\" History alt= Pathein was part of the Mon kingdom.

These include testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, brain tumors and neuroblastoma. It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, hearing problems, kidney problems, and vomiting. Other serious side effects include numbness, trouble walking, allergic reactions, electrolyte problems, and heart disease. Use during pregnancy can cause harm to the baby. Cisplatin is in the platinum- based antineoplastic family of medications. It works in part by binding to DNA and inhibiting its replication. Cisplatin was discovered in 1845 and licensed for medical use in 1978 and 1979. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical use Cisplatin is administered intravenously as short-term infusion in normal saline for treatment of solid and haematological malignancies. It is used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g., small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and ovarian cancer), lymphomas, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, and germ cell tumors. Cisplatin is particularly effective against testicular cancer; its adoption has increased the cure rate from 10% to 85%. In addition, cisplatin is used in Auger therapy. Side effects Cisplatin has a number of side effects that can limit its use: * Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) is a major concern. The dose should be reduced when the person's kidney function is impaired. Adequate hydration is used in an effort to prevent damage. Amifostine has been studied in an effort to prevent problems. Nephrotoxicity is a dose-limiting side effect. * Neurotoxicity (nerve damage) can be anticipated by performing nerve conduction studies before and after treatment. Common neurological side effects of cisplatin include visual perception and hearing disorder, which can occur soon after treatment begins. While triggering apoptosis through interfering with DNA replication remains the primary mechanism of cisplatin, this has not been found to contribute to neurological side effects. Recent studies have shown that cisplatin noncompetitively inhibits an archetypal, membrane-bound mechanosensitive sodium-hydrogen ion transporter known as NHE-1. It is primarily found on cells of the peripheral nervous system, which are aggregated in large numbers near the ocular and aural stimuli-receiving centers. This noncompetitive interaction has been linked to hydroelectrolytic imbalances and cytoskeleton alterations, both of which have been confirmed in vitro and in vivo. However, NHE-1 inhibition has been found to be both dose- dependent (half-inhibition = 30 Œºg/mL) and reversible. * Nausea and vomiting: cisplatin is one of the most emetogenic chemotherapy agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics (ondansetron, granisetron, etc.) in combination with corticosteroids. Aprepitant combined with ondansetron and dexamethasone has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just ondansetron and dexamethasone. * Ototoxicity (hearing loss): there is at present no effective treatment to prevent this side effect, which may be severe, although there is ongoing investigation of acetylcysteine injections as a preventative measure. Audiometric analysis may be necessary to assess the severity of ototoxicity. Other drugs (such as the aminoglycoside antibiotic class) may also cause ototoxicity, and the administration of this class of antibiotics in patients receiving cisplatin is generally avoided. The ototoxicity of both the aminoglycosides and cisplatin may be related to their ability to bind to melanin in the stria vascularis of the inner ear or the generation of reactive oxygen species. * Electrolyte disturbance: Cisplatin can cause hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia. The hypocalcaemia seems to occur in those with low serum magnesium secondary to cisplatin, so it is not primarily due to the cisplatin. * Hemolytic anemia can be developed after several courses of cisplatin. It is suggested that an antibody reacting with a cisplatin-red-cell membrane is responsible for hemolysis.  Pharmacology  Cisplatin interferes with DNA replication, which kills the fastest proliferating cells, which in theory are cancerous. Following administration, one chloride ion is slowly displaced by water to give the aquo complex cis-[PtCl(NH3)2(H2O)]+, in a process termed aquation. Dissociation of the chloride is favored inside the cell because the intracellular chloride concentration is only 3‚Äì20% of the approximately 100 mM chloride concentration in the extracellular fluid. The water molecule in cis-[PtCl(NH3)2(H2O)]+ is itself easily displaced by the N-heterocyclic bases on DNA. Guanine preferentially binds. Subsequent to formation of [PtCl(guanine-DNA)(NH3)2]+, crosslinking can occur via displacement of the other chloride, typically by another guanine. Cisplatin crosslinks DNA in several different ways, interfering with cell division by mitosis. The damaged DNA elicits DNA repair mechanisms, which in turn activate apoptosis when repair proves impossible. In 2008, researchers were able to show that the apoptosis induced by cisplatin on human colon cancer cells depends on the mitochondrial serine-protease Omi/Htra2. Since this was only demonstrated for colon carcinoma cells, it remains an open question if the Omi/Htra2 protein participates in the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in carcinomas from other tissues. Most notable among the changes in DNA are the 1,2-intrastrand cross-links with purine bases. These include 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) adducts which form nearly 90% of the adducts and the less common 1,2-intrastrand d(ApG) adducts. 1,3-intrastrand d(GpXpG) adducts occur but are readily excised by the nucleotide excision repair (NER). Other adducts include inter-strand crosslinks and nonfunctional adducts that have been postulated to contribute to cisplatin's activity. Interaction with cellular proteins, particularly HMG domain proteins, has also been advanced as a mechanism of interfering with mitosis, although this is probably not its primary method of action. = Cisplatin resistance = Cisplatin combination chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment of many cancers. Initial platinum responsiveness is high but the majority of cancer patients will eventually relapse with cisplatin-resistant disease. Many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been proposed including changes in cellular uptake and efflux of the drug, increased detoxification of the drug, inhibition of apoptosis and increased DNA repair. Oxaliplatin is active in highly cisplatin-resistant cancer cells in the laboratory; however, there is little evidence for its activity in the clinical treatment of patients with cisplatin-resistant cancer. The drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer; the mechanism for this activity is unknown. =Transplatin= Transplatin, the trans stereoisomer of cisplatin, has formula trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] and does not exhibit a comparably useful pharmacological effect. Two mechanisms have been suggested to explain the reduced anticancer effect of transplatin. Firstly, the trans arrangement of the chloro ligands is thought to confer transplatin with greater chemical reactivity, causing transplatin to become deactivated before it reaches the DNA where cisplatin exerts its pharmacological action. Secondly, the stereo- conformation of transplatin is such that it is unable to form the characteristic 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) adducts formed by cisplatin in abundance. =Molecular structure= Cisplatin is the square planar coordination complex cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2]. The prefix cis indicates the cis isomer in which two similar ligands are in adjacent positions. The systematic chemical name of this molecule is cis‚Äìdiamminedichloroplatinum, where ammine with two m's indicates an ammonia (NH3) ligand, as opposed to an organic amine with one m.  History  The compound cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2] was first described by Michele Peyrone in 1845, and known for a long time as Peyrone's salt. The structure was deduced by Alfred Werner in 1893. In 1965, Barnett Rosenberg, Van Camp et al. of Michigan State University discovered that electrolysis of platinum electrodes generated a soluble platinum complex which inhibited binary fission in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. Although bacterial cell growth continued, cell division was arrested, the bacteria growing as filaments up to 300 times their normal length. The octahedral Pt(IV) complex cis-[PtCl4(NH3)2], but not the trans isomer, was found to be effective at forcing filamentous growth of E. coli cells. The square planar Pt(II) complex, cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2] turned out to be even more effective at forcing filamentous growth. This finding led to the observation that cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2] was indeed highly effective at regressing the mass of sarcomas in rats. Confirmation of this discovery, and extension of testing to other tumour cell lines launched the medicinal applications of cisplatin. Cisplatin was approved for use in testicular and ovarian cancers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 19 December 1978., and in the UK (and in several other European countries) in 1979. Recently, some researchers have investigated at the preclinical level new forms of cisplatin prodrugs in combination with nanomaterials in order to localize the release of the drug in the target. Synthesis Syntheses of cisplatin start from potassium tetrachloroplatinate. Several procedures are available. One obstacle is the facile formation of Magnus's green salt (MGS), which has the same empirical formula as cisplatin. The traditional way to avoid MGS involves the conversion of K2PtCl4 to K2PtI4, as originally described by Dhara. Reaction with ammonia forms PtI2(NH3)2 which is isolated as a yellow compound. When silver nitrate in water is added insoluble silver iodide precipitates and [Pt(OH2)2(NH3)2](NO3)2 remains in solution. Addition of potassium chloride will form the final product which precipitates In the triiodo intermediate the addition of the second ammonia ligand is governed by the trans effect. :600px A one-pot synthesis of cisplatin from K2PtCl4 has been developed. It relies on the slow release of ammonia from ammonium acetate.

Woke Me Up This Morning: Black Gospel Singers and the Gospel Life, University Press of Mississippi (1997), page xiv - Early years Born in Helena, Arkansas on February 12, 1907, Martin moved to Chicago with her family in 1917, where she studied piano. Although a high school teacher inspired her to dream of becoming a concert pianist, her future course was changed after accompanying the Young People's Choir at Ebenezer Baptist Church. She came into contact with Thomas A. Dorsey, known as the Father of Gospel Music, through her work as the pianist for the youth choir. With Dorsey's help, she and Theodore Frye organized the Martin-Frye Quartet, a youth group consisting of Eugene Smith, Norsalus McKissick, Robert Anderson, James Lawrence, Willie Webb and Romance Watson, in 1933. Martin renamed the group the Roberta Martin Singers in 1936 and added Bessie Folk, Myrtle Scott and Delois Barrett Campbell to the group in the 1940s. The group set the standard for the gospel choir and mixed group, and had an extremely successful recording career, featuring such hits as \\"Only A Look,\\" and \\"Grace.\\"Wimbush, Vincent L. African Americans and the Bible: Sacred Texts and Social Structures, Continuum International Publishing Group (2001), page 471 - Most of these songs were published by Roberta Martin Studio of Music, a publishing house in Chicago that she incorporated in 1939, and would eventually publish outstanding compositions by gospel artists ranging from Professor Alex Bradford to James Cleveland. Her first composition, \\"Try Jesus, He Satisfies,\\" was an immediate hit in 1943.Darden, Bob. People Get Ready!: A New History of Black Gospel Music, Continuum International Publishing Group (2004), page 190 - She was also the choir director of the Pisgah Baptist Church in Chicago for many years. Musical career The theme song of the Roberta Martin Singers is \\"Only A Look.\\" It was always sung at the opening of their concerts, at their annual Anniversary Program in Chicago, and was recorded on the Apollo label with Bessie Folk with Delois Barrett as lead soloists and later on the Savoy label with Delois Barrett as lead vocalist. Martin's group was unique in a number of ways. It was the first to include both male and female voices in a small group format. Martin favored smooth harmonies and a subtle rhythmic dynamic in which her singers were slightly, almost imperceptibly, behind the beat. On slower songs Martin featured lead singers against a subdued background provided by the rest of the group; on jubilee and shout material she used the more energetic call-and-response technique typical of Holiness churches. Martin encouraged her singers to maintain their individual personalities, allowing the audience to distinguish each backup singer's voice rather than blending them into a single choral sound. Martin complemented her group's performance with her piano accompaniment, which often dictated the rhythm and pace of the song or commented on it by responding to or accenting a singer's performance. Martin's piano style reflected the influence of Holiness artists such as Arizona Dranes and her classical training. The other musical signature of the Roberta Martin Singers was the accompaniment of \\"Little\\" Lucy Smith on the Hammond organ. Her droning introductory chord and unique \\"passes\\" using the bass pedals set the tone for a meditative experience and became a recognized trademark of a \\"Roberta Martin gospel song\\". Martin's refined, subdued style, which emphasized phrasing and modulation, had a profound influence on many gospel artists, including Albertina Walker, James Cleveland and Alex Bradford. Cleveland and Bradford wrote and arranged for and performed with her group early in their careers. Her stylistic restraint did not, on the other hand, mean that her group lacked fervor or emotional punch; as one commentator noted, \\"Bert would sneak up on you and hurt you.\\" Roberta briefly retired from music in the 60's due in part to her battle with cancer, but came back to record her final album Praise God (from whom all blessings flow), and her vocal recording, \\"I Have Hope\\", which was written by her good friend Jessie Jimerson (aka Jessie Jimerson-Phillips.) Her group disbanded upon her death in 1969, but the surviving members continued to perform as a group in reunion concerts into the 21st century. Many of the members later had solo careers, such as Delois Barrett and Gloria Griffin, who was the composer of the classic gospel song \\"God Specializes\\", made famous by the Roberta Martin Singers in concerts and recordings. Death Roberta Martin died of cancer on January 18, 1969 at the age of 61. Well-known and very popular in the African- American community, her funeral in Chicago attracted over 50,000 mourners. Legacy She composed about seventy songs, arranged and published 280 gospel songs, and reached and inspired thousands of listeners selling sheet music. Her compositions include \\"He Knows Just How Much We Can Bear,\\" and \\"God Is Still on the Throne\\" (1959), \\"Let It Be\\" (1950), and \\"Just Jesus and Me\\" (1966). Martin earned six Gold recordsRuether, Rosemary Radford. Encyclopedia of Women And Religion in North America, Indiana University Press (2006), page 991 - and the Roberta Martin Singers sang at Gian-Carlo Menotti's Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, in 1963. Her great contribution to the history of gospel music was her development of a distinctive gospel-piano style and the special sound of her group, which integrated for the first time men and women into the gospel chorus during the mid-40s when she brought female voices into her all-male group, which she accompanied on piano.Southern, Eileen. The Music of Black Americans: A History W. W. Norton & Company (1997) - page 462 - On July 15, 1998, the United States Postal Service issued a 32 cent commemorative stamp honoring Martin's influence. The stamp was one of four honoring gospel women. The other women honored were Mahalia Jackson, Clara Ward, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.

Neil Diamond has a cameo role playing himself. In the film, Darren Silverman's longtime friends try to save him from marrying his controlling new girlfriend, whose behavior threatens the friends, their band, and Darren's chance at happiness with his lifelong true love. The movie was remade in Telugu language as Thotti Gang in 2002 and Hindi language as De Taali in 2008. It is the first film from Columbia Pictures to have the involvement of Village Roadshow Pictures until 2016. Plot Darren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and Neil Diamond fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond tribute band called \\"Diamonds in the Rough\\". Darren meets a beautiful but domineering psychologist who is showing signs of being emotionally abusive, Judith Fessbeggler, through a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig. Six weeks into their relationship, Darren asks Judith if whether they could finally have sex, but Judith refuses in the belief that premarital sex is wrong; rather, she suggests non-penetrative sex as alternative, during which Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw. Judith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that Darren quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care. Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail. The friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his \\"one and only\\", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle to take her final vows as a nun. When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith. However, Judith eventually discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go. When they visit Coach Norton in jail (who accidentally killed a referee in a fit of rage) his advice is that they should just kill her. The pair attempt to shoot Judith, but end up deciding against it. Sandy's feelings for Darren are reawakened, but the pair's attempted date is ruined by Darren's preoccupation with Judith. Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent, but Darren snaps out of it and runs the 30 miles there to win her back. Chained to an engine block in Wayne's garage, Judith helps J.D. realize he is gay. She knocks him unconscious to steal his keys and escape, only to be tranquilized with a dart gun by Wayne. Returned to the garage, Judith seduces Wayne into releasing one of her hands, so she escapes again. She runs to Darren's house in time to see him kiss Sandy, but shames him into confessing his engagement to Judith. Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent again. Darren has Wayne and J.D. arrested. After escaping from jail with the help of Coach Norton, J.D. and Wayne rush to the convent on the brink of Sandy's final vows as a nun. They convince her that Darren still loves her. They then kidnap Neil Diamond to help Darren and Sandy reunite. At the wedding, Neil stalls the proceedings with the song \\"Hello Again\\" while Darren and Sandy reunite, Wayne and Judith (the latter being furious that her wedding is ruined) beat each other up (as love play) and J.D. arrives holding Coach in his arms, who coincidentally reveals to J.D. that he too is gay. The couples then wed on stage at Neil Diamond's concert; Darren to Sandy, Wayne to Judith, and J.D. to Coach.

Economic contributions = Sticky information and inattentiveness = In 2002, with Gregory Mankiw he proposed the sticky-information Phillips curveMankiw, N.G. and R. Reis (2002) \\"Sticky Information Versus Sticky Prices: A Proposal To Replace The New Keynesian Phillips Curve,\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117(4), 1295‚Äì1328, and followed it later with rational theories of inattention,R.

Reis (2010) Imperfect Information and Aggregate Supply\\" Handbook of Monetary Economics This model of nominal rigidities is based on the slow diffusion of information among the population of price setters and displays three related properties that are more consistent with accepted views about the effects of monetary policy. First, disinflations are always contractionary (although announced disinflations are less contractionary than surprise ones). Second, monetary policy shocks have their maximum impact on inflation with a substantial delay. Third, the change in inflation is positively correlated with the level of economic activity. = Empirical study of disagreement in surveys = In 2004, with Gregory Mankiw and Justin Wolfers, Reis started the modern empirical literature that focuses on disagreement in surveys.Mankiw, N. G., J. Wolfers and R. Reis (2004) \\"Disagreement about Inflation Expectations\\" NBER Macroeconomics Annual, 18, 209‚Äì248 A large literature that followed has documented the empirical properties of disagreement, has shown that it is very different from uncertainty, and has used it as moments to evaluate imperfect information models. = Pure inflation = In 2010, with Mark Watson, Reis developed measures of pure inflation, which have become popular measures of core inflation used by central banks around the world.Reis, R. and M. Watson (2010) \\"Relative Goods' Prices, Pure Inflation, and the Phillips Correlation\\" AEJ: Macroeconomics, 2 (3), 128‚Äì57 = The diabolic loop and ESBies = In 2011, Reis with Markus Brunnermeier, Luis Garicano, Philip R. Lane and others, argued that when banks hold significant amounts of bonds issued by their sovereign this creates a \`\`diabolic loop\\" whereby small changes in the perceived solvency of the sovereign can amplify into large crises.Brunnermeier, Garicano, Lane, Marco Pagano, Reis, Santos, Thesmar, van Nieuwerburgh and Vayanos (2011) \\"ESBies: A Realistic Reform of Europe's Financial Architecture\\" In: The Future of Banking: A VoxEu.org Book, edited by Thorsten Beck, 15-20, October 2011 This concept has become central in accounts of the Euro crisis, and is also referred to as the \\"doom loop\\" or the \\"bank- government nexus\\". They proposed creating European Safe Bonds (ESBies) a new financial vehicle allowing banks in the Eurozone to break the diabolic loop, without creating the problems of joint and several liability with Eurobonds.Brunnermeier, Langfeld, Pagano, Reis, van Nieuwerburgh and Vayanos (2017) \\"ESBies: Safety in the Tranches,\\" Economic Policy 32, 177-219. The European Systemic Risk Board proposed a variant of ESBies, labelled Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities (or SBBS) as a crucial ingredient to have a more stable Eurozone. = HANK models = In 2012, Reis wrote the first model that merged the Aiyagari model of incomplete markets with a New Keynesian model of nominal rigidities.Oh, H, and R. Reis (2011) \\"Targeted Transfers and the Fiscal Response to the Great Recession,\\" Journal of Monetary Economics, 59, S50-S64 In 2016, he published the first business-cycle model that merged the Krusell- Smith model of business cycles with the Christiano‚ÄìEichenbaum‚ÄìEvans model of monetary policy.McKay, A. and R.

Hall he invented the concept of central bank insolvency to describe the impact of possible losses from quantitative easing programs.Reis, R. (2013) \\"The Mystique Surrounding the Central Bank's Balance Sheet, Applied to the European Crisis\\" American Economic Review, 103 (3), 135‚Äì40 Hall R. and R. Reis (2013) \\"Maintaining Central-Bank Solvency under New-Style Central Banking\\" = The misallocation hypothesis of slumps and crashes = In 2013, he proposed the misallocation hypothesis for the European slump and crash.R. Reis (2013) \\"The Portuguese Slump and Crash and the Euro Crisis,\\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 46, 143-193 It contends that by joining the eurozone, countries in the European periphery enjoyed large capital inflows, but their underdeveloped financial and political systems misallocated this capital leading to a slump in productivity and sowing the seeds of the crisis. Fast financial integration without financial depth creates a slump and a crash. Some accounts of why low real interest rates can be causing misallocation and low productivity build on his idea. = QE and satiating the market for reserves = In 2016, at the Kansas City Federal Reserve economic policy symposium, Reis proposed that a central bank's balance sheet should be just large enough to satiate the demand for bank reserves.R.

It is found in the headwaters of only two rivers in Texas, United States: the Comal River and the San Marcos River. It is generally smaller than long and feeds on small invertebrates. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States and is also listed as endangered by the IUCN. Distribution and habitat The fountain darter is known from only two locations, primarily the headwaters of the spring-fed San Marcos River, having been observed as far as 1.25 miles downstream, as well as the upper reaches of the Comal River in central Texas. Its geographic isolation is reflective of its incredibly specific habitation preferences which demand conditions which can only be found in these, two, Texas river headwaters alone. In these unique locations they can be observed in open areas created by a medium current at depths of 3-5feet near the outlets of contributing spring heads with rates of flow low enough to retain a layer of percolating sand. These springs can be found adjacent to the main springs that deliver the tremendous volumes of cool, perfectly clear water that forms each river. They require a stable water temperature, within the low 70s, year round which the springs provide. These two locations are uniquely suited habitat as these ecosystems‚Äô diversity and ultra-high densities of plant and animal life are unparalleled, with quantities exponentially surpassing each and every ecosystem within the region and all surrounding regions. Behavior The fountain darter feeds on small invertebrates. It breeds all year round and the eggs are deposited on dead leaves, stems, rocks, algae or other objects. This fish lives for one to two years. Status They primarily occupy the sandy tops of lesser flowing springheads or flat rock surfaces absent of rooted plants, or decaying plant matter and spawn within the vibrantly abundant and healthy vegetation that thrives in these unique, pristine, springfed river systems. Due to the overuse and subsequent abuse of their isolated and specific habitat which primarily stems from the behaviors of some of the many thousands of river tourist who, unaware or who don't care, regularly destroy these areas. In addition to the financially motivated, less than perfect, enforcement of the blatant ecological devastation caused by tourism, deep pocketed development interests actively seek to acquire and be permitted to build on and around the darter's ultra-prime habitat due to the unparalleled beauty of these ecologically unique areas. An extra worry for the future of fountain darters is the parasitic, non-native trematode (Centrocestus formosanus), whose impact on the darter population is not yet known. As of 2004, only the Comal population is seriously affected by the parasite. The National Fish Hatchery and Technology Center in San Marcos keeps a reserve population of 500 adults as a hedge against a man-made or natural event wiping out the fish in the wild. The IUCN rates this species as \\"Endangered\\". Conservation efforts include encouraging people to use less water in order to maximise water flow from the springs and to keep the rivers free from trash.

The term is most frequently used in the context of ecosystems. Botany A hemiboreal forest has some characteristics of a boreal forest, and also shares features with temperate-zone forests to the south. Coniferous trees predominate in the hemiboreal zone, but a significant number of deciduous species, such as aspens, oaks, maples, ash trees, birches, beeches, hazels, and hornbeams, also occur. Climate The term sometimes denotes the form of climate characteristic of the zone of hemiboreal forests-- specifically, the climates designated Dfb, Dwb and Dsb in the K√∂ppen climate classification scheme. On occasion, it is applied to all areas that have long, cold winters and warm (but not hot) summers--including areas that are semiarid and arid based on average annual precipitation. It can also be applied to some areas with a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc), particularly those with continental climate characteristics. Examples Examples of locations with hemiboreal climates or ecosystems include: *Much of southern Canada (all of southeastern Canada except for parts of southern Ontario as well as the central Prairie Provinces outside the grasslands) *Within the United States: most parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, along with eastern North Dakota.

Lacauchie, Paris, c. 1832, Museum of Music History Giulia Grisi, photographed circa 1860 Born in Milan, Giulia Grisi was the daughter of Gaetano Grisi, one of Napoleon's Italian officers, and Giovanna n√©e Grassini. She came from a musically gifted family, her maternal aunt Giuseppina Grassini (1773‚Äì1850) being a favourite opera singer both on the continent and in London. Her older sister, Giuditta and her cousin Carlotta were both artistes, the former as a singer and the latter as a ballet dancer. Giuditta was the creator of the pants role of Romeo in Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi. Grisi was trained for a musical career, making her stage debut as Emma in Rossini's Zelmira in Bologna in 1828. Operatic career Rossini and Bellini both took an interest in her, she was the first to play the part of Adalgisa in Bellini's Norma in Milan, in which the dramatic soprano Giuditta Pasta took the title role. Grisi appeared in Paris in 1832 in the title role of Semiramide in Rossini's opera and was a great success; in 1834 she made her debut in London as Ninetta in La gazza ladra; and, again in Paris, in 1835 she created the role of Elvira in the premiere of Bellini's final opera, I puritani at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien. In 1842, Donizetti wrote the parts of Norina and Ernesto in Don Pasquale for Grisi and Giovanni Matteo de Candia, usually known by his stage-name of Mario, who was to become the love of her life. Her voice was described as a dramatic soprano which, during her prime, was praised by music critics for its exceptional beauty, evenness and smoothness. Her career spanned 30 years in total. She was a noted actress, appearing regularly in London with such eminent singers as Luigi Lablache, Giovanni Battista Rubini and Antonio Tamburini, not to mention her husband, Mario. Indeed, the prickly press commentator Henry Chorley praised both her and Mario for their success in establishing Italian opera as an important component of the London music scene. In 1854, after they were married, Giulia and Mario undertook a lucrative tour of the United States of America, where they were treated as major international celebrities. Personal life * First marriage, in 1836 Grisi married the French nobleman Count G√©rard de Melcy. The marriage was unhappy, but he refused her a divorce for some years. In 1838, her husband discovered a letter written to her by Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry (then Lord Castlereagh) and the two men fought a duel on 16 June of that year. Lord Castlereagh was wounded in the wrist; the Count was uninjured. After the duel, Grisi left her husband and began an affair with Lord Castlereagh with whom she had a son, George Frederick Ormsby,National Portrait Gallery  G.F. Ormsby  https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw262639/George-Frederick- Ormsby born in November 1839, in London. Since Lord Castlereagh had no legitimate children by his wife, George Frederick was first brought up by his natural father under the understanding of guardianship or god-father figure, while Grisi continued her singing career, since this son was never legally recognized as a Stewart they granted him a blessed last-name Ormsby \\"by the willow-tree in Welsh\\". After Grisi and Lord Castlereagh's relationship ended, he was encharged of paying his education at an English boarding-school and brought their son as an uncle figure to see her whenever she was in London.Kendall-Davies 2003, pp. 60‚Äî61 Whilst living with \\"Mario\\" Giovanni de Candia before their marriage, Giulia and Mario kept homes in Paris and London.

They frequently returned to Italy, living seasonally at the Villa Salviati in Florence, a property Mario had purchased in 1849. Grisi wrote in her diary of the exciting times spent there with distinguished guests drawn from the world of opera and the aristocracy. But she rather preferred their private family vacations at their cottage in Bordighera the place where she felt at home. Death Grave of Giulia Grisi, in Paris, at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, France. During a trip to Saint Petersburg, Russia, while traveling by train with her family, Grisi was involved in an accident after having crossed the border into Germany. She was taken to a hotel in Berlin, where she spent her last days under the care of a Dr. Isabell. She died there on 29 November 1869, aged 58.

It was recorded live on August 15, 1981, at the 7th Street Entry, a venue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The album is a fast and furious hardcore workout that bears almost no resemblance to the melodic post-hardcore that the band became known for in the mid '80s. The title has a double meaning, referring to both the band's ability to play as fast as they could (there are 17 songs crammed into 26¬Ω minutes) and their penchant for amphetamine pills. History H√ºsker D√º's August 1981 concert was recorded straight to 4-track soundboard tape on a three hundred dollar budget. Once the band had taped it they realized they lacked the financial means to release the album. Friend of the band and member of Minutemen, Mike Watt, offered to put out the album on his label, New Alliance. The original LP release on New Alliance contained an insert with lyrics and upcoming tour dates. The album got a European release on Alternative Tentacles in the UK. The album was reissued in 1987 on SST Records on compact disc and LP. Like H√ºsker D√º's other releases, Land Speed Record has not been remastered to alter the LP's sound for the compact disc release. The band's ongoing royalty disputes with SST have been given as the cause for not having a unique CD edition issued. Ken Shipley of The Numero Group has noted that the original tape was stolen from the band's van. The SST CD contains only two tracks, one for each side of the original LP. The Numero Group's box set Savage Young D√º will include an alternate version of the same set, recorded at a Twin/Tone Records showcase two weeks later. Music The album sounds like straightforward hardcore at first glance; with volume and power being emphasized over melody, it's the H√ºsker D√º record that least sounds like H√ºsker D√º. Bob Mould once referred to it as \\"the bad part of the acid...It sounds like when you go to a gig and get your ears blown off\\". The album was recorded just as they went on a tour of various places in the country, those close to the band say upon their return the band was louder, faster and noisier than before. The magazine Discords said about it: \\"It's hard to believe but the only Minneapolis hardcore band have gotten even faster during their stay away.\\" Yet there are some elements emerging under the wash of noise that foreshadow the band's future direction. \\"Don't Try To Call\\" is one of their most melodic early songs, while Hart's \\"Data Control\\" slows the tempo to conjure a creepy musical mood to match the paranoia of the lyrics. \\"Bricklayer\\" and \\"Let's Go Die\\" appear as studio recordings on the band's first studio album, Everything Falls Apart, and on the Rhino reissue, Everything Falls Apart and More.

Gronlund is best remembered for his pioneering work in adapting the International Socialism of Karl Marx and Ferdinand Lassalle to the American idiom in his popular 1884 book, The Cooperative Commonwealth, and for his influence upon the thinking of utopian novelist Edward Bellamy, newspaper publisher Julius Wayland, and the American socialist movement of the 1880s and 1890s.  Biography  = Early years = Laurence Gronlund was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on July 13, 1846, the son of a minister. He was a participant in the Danish‚ÄìGerman War of 1864.William D. P. Bliss and Rudolf M. Binder (eds.), The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform. Third Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1910; pg. 564. Gronlund graduated from the University of Copenhagen's Faculty of Law in 1865, and emigrated to the United States two years later.Leonard Schlup, \\"Laurence Gronlund,\\" in Leonard Schlup and James G. Ryan (eds.), Historical Dictionary of the Gilded Age. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2003; pg. 206. For a short time he taught German in a public school in Milwaukee prior to his 1869 admission to the bar and the opening of a law practice in Chicago. Gronlund was converted to the ideas of socialism and gave up the practice of law in order that he might write and lecture on matters of collective ownership. Gronlund joined the German-American dominated Socialist Labor Party (SLP), a political party still in its infancy, and in 1878 published his first work, a pamphlet entitled The Coming Revolution: Its Principles. Gronlund was a firm advocate of trade union-based, German-style International Socialism, in contrast to various communitarian schemes then in vogue in the United States. = The Cooperative Commonwealth = The first edition of Gronlund's The Cooperative Commonwealth was published in Boston in 1884 In 1884 Gronlund published his most influential and best remembered work, a small volume titled The Cooperative Commonwealth. This book attempted to popularize Karl Marx's ideas about the labor theory of value and the fundamentally exploitative nature of competition within the capitalist system. The working class, forced to scramble for survival under the competitive system, was depicted as the \\"natural prey\\" of small shopkeeper \\"parasites\\" who existed by inflating selling prices and depreciating quality.Laurence Gronlund, The Cooperative Commonwealth. Boston, MA: Lee and Shepard, 1884; pp. 44-45. Moreover, the \\"big capitalists\\" were said to wield a still more powerful weapon, that of combination, which made possible more efficient \\"fleecings\\" of working people.Gronlund, The Cooperative Commonwealth, pp. 48-49. The capitalist system contained within itself a \\"fatal contradiction\\", Gronlund argued ‚Äì an inherent tendency towards \\"overproduction\\", production at a higher level than the purchasing power of consumers: > Since ... Labor under our wage-system, our profit-system, our fleecings- > system, only receives about one half [of the value of its production] as its > share, it follows that the producers cannot buy back that which they create. > For the more Capital is being accumulated in private hands, the more > impossible this wage-system renders it for the producers to buy what they > produce. The more necessary it becomes for capitalists to dispose of their > ever increasing fleecings, the less the ability of the people to purchase > them will, relatively become. ... The more Capital, the more > 'overproduction.'Gronlund, The Cooperative Commonwealth, pp. 71-72. Individualism in production, although efficient in causing Capital to grow, was simultaneously \\"digging the grave of Capital\\", Gronlund declared.Gronlund, The Cooperative Commonwealth, pg. 72. With Marx's Das Kapital still unavailable in English translation during the decade of the 1880s, Gronlund's reinterpretation of Marx into the American vernacular was revelatory. More than 100,000 copies of The Cooperative Commonwealth were sold,\\"Gronlund Talks: Discusses the Future of Socialism: Would Be a Collectivist,\\" The Morning Call [San Francisco], vol. 77, no. 35 (January 4, 1895), pg. 12. and the book would remain one of the most influential works on the socialist theme in the United States for the rest of the 19th century. According to historian Rudolf Kirk, The Cooperative Commonwealth reflects Gronlund's distinctly Christian interpretation of Marx. = Later writings = Gronlund's second book, √áa ira!, was a reevaluation of the role of French revolutionary Georges Jacques Danton (1759‚Äì1794) After having lived in the United States for 20 years, in 1885 Gronlund made an extended stay to Great Britain, where he would remain for two years.\\"Socialists to the Front: Eager to Convert the Rest of the United Labor Party,\\" The Sun [New York City], vol. 54, no. 297 (June 24, 1887), pg. 1. Gronlund spent his time in Britain lecturing on socialist themes to both political and academic audiences, touching on both current politicsSee notice of his speech to the Christian Socialist Union on \\"Deeds of the French Bourgeoisie,\\" Pall Mall Gazette [London], vol. 95, whole no. 6897 (April 26, 1886), pg. 5. and historical themes in speeches made across England and Scotland.See account of his lecture on \\"England's Future in the Light of Evolution,\\" Glasgow Herald, vol. 104, no. 57 (March 8, 1886), pg. 12. Gronlund returned to his adopted country in 1887 and resumed his activism on behalf of the Socialist Labor Party. Gronlund was immediately called upon by the SLP to differentiate its views from the single tax program of Henry George, an 1886 candidate for mayor of New York City on the ticket of the upstart United Labor Party which the SLP had actively supported. The result of this assignment was two pamphlets, Socialism vs. Single Tax and Insufficiency of Henry George's Theory.Insufficiency of Henry George's Theory. New York: New York Labor News Co., 1887; Socialism vs. Tax Reform: An Answer to Henry George. New York: New York Labor News Co., 1887. The departure of the SLP from the broader United Labor Party of which it was a part was civil, with Gronlund remarking in a June 1887 lecture at New York City that Henry George was > ... a most noble man, the starting wedge for socialism in the United States, > but his theory is insufficient and his remedies would not accomplish what he > believes. When it comes down to the kernel of the matter, he is radically > different from us and we must part company from him.\\"Socialism Pure and > Undefiled,\\" The Sun [New York City], vol. 54, no. 299 (June 26, 1887), pg. > 2. Gronlund turned his attention to history with the publication of his second book, a reevaluation of the life and activities of French Jacobin revolutionary Georges Danton in the French Revolution of 1789 to 1794. At the end of his life Gronlund regarded this 1887 work, √áa Ira! or Danton in the French Revolution, as his most important work.Leonard D. Abbott, \\"A Memory of Laurence Gronlund,\\" Social Democratic Herald [Chicago], vol. 2, no. 20, whole no. 70 (November 4, 1899), pg. 1. In his book Gronlund attempted to challenge the popular image of Danton, first President of the Committee of Public Safety, as a terrorist and to restore his place to history as a leader of the democratic French revolution. A member of the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Labor Party in 1888, Gronlund broke with the party soon after, ostensibly over its decision to open a saloon on Fourth Street in New York City as a means of generating funds for use of the party. Late in 1890 Gronlund published his third book, an \\"essay in ethics\\" entitled Our Destiny: The Influence of Socialism on Morals and Religion. This work touches upon the quasi-religious aspect of the socialist project. Gronlund argued that socialism had two sides, a \\"good kind\\" of \\"mutual good will and mutual help\\" as well as a negative socialism of \\"hatred and spoliation.\\"Laurence Gronlund, Our Destiny: The Influence of Socialism on Morals and Religion: An Essay in Ethics. London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1890; pg. 6. Gronlund supported \\"mutual good will and mutual help,\\" at the time best expressed in the United States by the emerging movement built around Nationalist Clubs. Gronlund noted with bemusement that while people shuddered in fear of \\"destructive Socialism,\\" at the same time the concentration of capitalism through trusts and increased government intervention in economic affairs was slowly bringing into existence a socialist regime.Gronlund, Our Destiny, pg. 8. = Final years = Gronlund devoted himself almost exclusively to lecturing until his appointment to a poorly-paid position in the office of the Bureau of Labor in Washington, D.C.,\\"Known by the World,\\" Pittsburgh Dispatch, vol. 46 (November 9, 1891), pg. 4. where he worked for Commissioner of Labor Carroll D. Wright. In the early 1890s, Gronlund visited and spoke at the Church of the Carpenter in Boston, founded by the Christian Socialist minister W. D. P. Bliss. Gronlund also contributed to The Dawn, the journal of the Society of Christian Socialists. Following the end of his stint with the Bureau of Labor in 1893, Gronlund rededicated himself as a touring lecturer dealing with socialist themes. He was a speaker at a Congress of Economics held in conjunction with the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, speaking there alongside Henry George and Richard T. Ely. He also spoke to a variety of audiences from coast to coast, including forays into Utah\\"A Noted Lecturer: Laurence Gronlund Calls Himself a Collectivist,\\" Salt Lake Herald, vol. 50, no. 129 (October 11, 1894), pg. 2. and California. Owing to misgivings about the term \\"socialism\\" ‚Äì which he believed covered too many bedfellows, such as anarchists and communitarians ‚Äì Gronlund insisted upon describing himself as a \\"collectivist\\" in his later years on the lecture circuit. Despite this change in nomenclature, Gronlund remained orthodox in his socialist views, as he explained in one 1894 newspaper interview: > As collectivists, we do not approve of the violent methods of the European > [revolutionary] socialists. We want the gradual absorption of all capital by > the government in a peaceable manner. We are satisfied to work with the > Populists, or with Henry George, or with those who advocate government > ownership of railroads, for they are all in the same line with us, though we > go much farther. We would say government ownership of railways, banks, > telegraph lines, factories, mills, workshops, and all industries; also > government ownership of land, for land is capital. The government would be > the employer, the people the employed, and there would be no conflict of > interest. In addition to lecturing to audiences around the country about \\"collectivism\\", Gronlund plied his trade as a writer, contributing to the pages of Twentieth Century Magazine. Gronlund spoke not only to English-speaking audiences, but also spoke in his native Danish to members of the Scandinavian immigrant community during his travels around the United States. Gronlund was enthusiastic about the ideas and tactics of the Fabian Society in Great Britain and sought to emulate the Fabian movement on American soil, explicitly declared in 1895 that \\"this movement is evolutionary, not revolutionary.\\" In 1896, Gronlund and his wife Beulah, a regarded as a talented artist and art teacher, moved to the city of Seattle, Washington.Clarence Bagley, History of Seattle: From the Earliest Settlement to the Present Time: Volume 2. Chicago: S.J. Clarke Publishing Co., 1916; pg. 642. There Beulah Gronlund was active in launching the Seattle Humane Society, dedicated to the prevention of cruelty to animals. A fourth and final book, The New Economy: A Peaceable Solution of the Social Problem, was published in 1898 and emphasized the evolutionary and anti-class war orientation which Gronlund developed in his later years. = Death and legacy = Gronlund as he was depicted in a newspaper story in 1895. Laurence Gronlund died October 15, 1899, in New York City. He was 53 years old at the time of his death. At the time of his death Gronlund was remembered critically but warmly in the American socialist press. Writing in the Social Democratic Herald, Secretary of the Social Democratic Party of America Seymour Stedman remembered him as a proverbial absent-minded professor: > He was eccentric and careless. He would walk with pipe and paper along a > thriving thoroughfare oblivious of all; his hat shaped like a French > general's, peak in front and back; shoes well worn; clothes shabby, and was > in meeting reticent, even timid ... He treated the subject of Socialism > plainly and stripped it of utopianism. ... The peoples of the future will > dwell in peace where this hardy pioneer warred with the accumulated > prejudice, passions, and ignorance of the ages.Seymour Stedman, \\"Laurence > Gronlund,\\" Social Democratic Herald [Chicago], vol. 2, no. 19, whole no. 69 > (Oct. 28, 1899), pg. 2. Leonard D. Abbott recalled Gronlund as a \\"great soul\\" who had lived in poverty throughout his life out of commitment to the socialist cause, the recipient of \\"very small financial rewards from all his books put together.\\" He quoted Gronlund during his last year of life as rejecting the political strategy of winning power through independent political action, declaring \\"I regard [Eugene] Debs as the most unselfish of labor leaders, but you can't build up a third party in this county ‚Äì you've got to work through the Democratic Party.\\" Gronlund was enormously influential during the decades of the 1880s and 1890s and is credited by historian Daniel Bell with playing a pivotal role in the conversion of future Appeal to Reason publisher Julius Wayland to socialism in 1891.Daniel Bell, Marxian Socialism in the United States, in Donald Drew Egbert and Stow Persons, Socialism and American Life. In two volumes. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1952; vol. 1, pg. 259. Wayland would begin his first socialist newspaper, The Coming Nation, in 1893 and would build his subsequent publication into a mass circulation weekly that would help make socialism a broad political movement during the first two decades of the 20th century. Gronlund's articulation of a vision for a cooperative economy and society echoed over the next decades in early- twentieth century U.S. and Canadian leftist circles. It helped lead to the formation of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party in 1932, which became Canada's largest left-wing political party, and continues to this day as the New Democratic Party, and to the nature of the economic principles of the Farmer-Labor Party of the United States, particularly in the FLP's Minnesota affiliate, where advocacy for a Cooperative Commonwealth formed the central theme of the Party's platform from 1934, until the Minnesota FLP merged with the state Democratic Party to form the Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party in 1944.

It was Compaq Computer Corporation's first product, to be followed by others in the Compaq portable series and later Compaq Deskpro series.  Production  The Compaq Portable was announced in November 1982 and first shipped in March 1983, priced at US $2,995 () with a single half-height 5¬º\\" 360 kB diskette drive or $3,590 for dual, full-height diskette drives. The Compaq Portable folded up into a luggable case the size of a portable sewing machine. The computer was an early all-in-one, becoming available two years after the CP/M-based Osborne 1 and Kaypro II, in the same year as the MS-DOS-based (but not entirely IBM PC compatible) Dynalogic Hyperion, and a year before the Commodore SX-64. Its design was influenced by that of the Xerox Note Taker, a prototype computer developed at Xerox PARC in 1976. IBM responded to the Compaq Portable with the IBM Portable, developed because its sales force needed a comparable computer to sell against Compaq. Sales Compaq sold 53,000 units in the first year with a total of $111 million in revenue, an American Business record. In the second year revenue hit $329 million setting an industry record. Third year revenue was at $503.9 million, another US business record.  Design  = = The Compaq Portable has basically the same hardware as an IBM PC, transplanted into a luggable case (specifically designed to fit as carry-on luggage on an airplane), with Compaq's BIOS instead of IBM's. All Portables shipped with 128k of RAM and 1-2 double-sided double-density 360 KB disk drives. The machine uses a unique hybrid of the IBM MDA and CGA which supports the latter's graphics modes, but contains both cards' text fonts in ROM. When using the internal monochrome monitor the 9x14 font is used, and the 8x8 one when an external monitor is used (the user switches between internal and external monitors by pressing ). The user can use both IBM video standards, for graphics capabilities and high- resolution text. With a larger external monitor, the graphics hardware is also used in the original Compaq Deskpro desktop computer. Despite its success, the Compaq Portable had a few flaws in its hardware. The foam pads the keyboards used to make contact with a circuit board when pressed would eventually disintegrate over time, due to both the wear of normal use and natural wear. This would render the keyboard useless and would require a full replacement of any foam pad that was affected. The CRT display also suffered from a low refresh rate and heavy ghosting. = Software = Running WordPerfect 5.0. Compaq's efforts were possible because IBM had used mostly off-the-shelf parts for the PC and published full technical documentation for it, and because Microsoft had kept the right to license MS-DOS to other computer manufacturers. The only difficulty was the BIOS, because it contained IBM's copyrighted code. Compaq solved this problem by producing a clean room workalike that performed all documented functions of the IBM PC BIOS, but was completely written from scratch. Although numerous other companies soon also began selling PC compatibles, few matched Compaq's remarkable achievement of essentially-complete software compatibility with the IBM PC (typically reaching \\"95% compatibility\\" at best) until Phoenix Technologies and others began selling similarly reverse-engineered BIOSs on the open market. The first Portables used Compaq DOS 1.10, essentially identical to PC DOS 1.10 except for having a standalone BASIC that did not require the IBM PC's ROM Cassette BASIC, but this was superseded in a few months by DOS 2.00 which added hard disk support and other advanced features. Aside from using DOS 1.x, the initial Portables are similar to the 16k-64k models of the IBM PC in that the BIOS was limited to 544k of RAM and did not support expansion ROMs, thus making them unable to use EGA/VGA cards, hard disks, or similar hardware. After DOS 2.x and the IBM XT came out, Compaq upgraded the BIOS. Although the Portable was not offered with a factory hard disk, users commonly installed them. Starting in 1984, Compaq began offering a hard disk-equipped version, the Portable Plus, which also featured a single half-height floppy drive. The hard disk offered would be 10 to 21 megabytes, although bad sectors often reduced the space available for use. In 1985, Compaq introduced the Portable 286, but it was replaced by the more compact Portable II in a redesigned case within a few months. The Portable 286 featured a full height hard disk, and the options of one half-height floppy drive, two half-height floppy drives, or a half-height floppy drive and a tape backup drive.  Reception  BYTE wrote, after testing a prototype, that the Compaq Portable \\"looks like a sure winner\\" because of its portability, cost, and high degree of compatibility with the IBM PC. Its reviewer tested IBM PC DOS, CP/M-86, WordStar, Supercalc, and several other software packages, and found that all worked except one game. PC Magazine also rated the Compaq Portable very highly for compatibility, reporting that all tested applications ran. It praised the \\"rugged\\" hardware design and sharp display, and concluded that it was \\"certainly worth consideration by anyone seeking to run IBM PC software without an IBM PC\\".  Successors  This machine was the first of a series of Compaq Portable machines.

The nearest large towns are Warracknabeal, Dimboola and Nhill, all to the south. At the , Rainbow had a population of 683. History In 1899 the railway line was extended from Jeparit to a projected town site, Rainbow Rise, named after a sand lunette covered with wildflowers in the shape of a rainbow. A post office opened on 2 July 1900 and town blocks in Rainbow were sold in October 1900. By 1910 the township was referred to as the Metropolis of the Mallee. Robert Riby owned and operated the first newspaper in Rainbow. He married Mary Anne Palethorp. Rainbow was well known for its wheat. Silos still stand there and are visible from kilometres away. Many of the town's original settlers were of German descent, and came across country from South Australia. In its early years, names such as Strauss, Petschel, Bretag, Rogasch, Fischer, Schumann, Schulz, Kruger and Heinrich were common, as well as the English names Dunn, Wallis, Smith, Brown, Fisher and Small. The railway line transported wheat, other grains and passengers. In later years, it was used for freight only. The Rainbow Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1983. Rainbow was part of the Dimboola Shire until 25 January 1995, when the shire was united with the Lowan Shire. The town was the subject of an episode of the ABC television program Enough Rope, with Andrew Denton, on 31 July 2006.  Gauge  When the Melbourne to Adelaide main line was changed to standard gauge, the Rainbow branchline was also re-gauged. Today Rainbow is a small commercial centre for the surrounding agricultural area. To its south is Victoria's largest freshwater lake, Lake Hindmarsh. To its north are Lake Albacutya, which is usually dry but a Ramsar-listed bird habitat; and Wyperfeld National Park. Rainbow is a useful base from which tourists, especially birdwatchers, can explore the surrounding region. It is notable for its unique main street, which incorporates a central strip of parkland. Despite its remoteness, Rainbow prides itself on community involvement. There are football, netball, cricket, golf, bowls and volleyball clubs, arts groups, a community learning group, service clubs and a proactive town committee. Local businesses include a baker, butcher, chemist, modern supermarket, stock and station agents, a weekly newspaper (the Rainbow-Jeparit Argus) and a service station. There is also a police station. With its neighbouring township Jeparit, Rainbow has a football team, Jeparit-Rainbow, competing in the Horsham District Football League. Rainbow has one school, Rainbow P-12 College at 17 Albert Street. Established in January 2015 from the former primary and secondary schools, it serves students from nearby farms and towns, from Years foundation (prep) to 12 (VCE). The former Rainbow Primary School for younger students was co-located to the site of the secondary college in 2011, in a new $3.5 million building. P-12 college was established following a process of community consultation. Golfers play at the course of the Rainbow Golf Club on Nhill Road.

The screenplay by Yuri Zeltser and Grace Cary Bickley is based on Joseph Finder's 1998 novel of the same name. Plot Attorney Claire Kubik (Ashley Judd) and her woodworker husband Tom (James Caviezel) find their idyllic life in Marin County, California shattered when, during a Christmas shopping excursion in San Francisco's Union Square, he is captured by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and charged with the 1988 murders of nine unarmed civilians in a village in El Salvador. Claire learns Tom's real name is Ronald Chapman, and she is shocked to discover he was a covert military operative serving in the Marines and has been on the run for the past twelve years. Tom admits he was present at the scene of the mass murders but staunchly denies any involvement in the killings. He insists he has been scapegoated in order to protect the real culprit, Major James Hernandez (Juan Carlos Hern√°ndez), who has become the aide of Brigadier General Bill Marks (Bruce Davison). First Lieutenant Terence Embry (Adam Scott) is assigned to defend Tom, but his youth and lack of experience prompt Claire to decide to assist professionally in defending her husband. When she realizes she needs help from someone familiar with the workings of a military court, she hires Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman), an embittered former military attorney who has a grudge against the military brass, to assist her. Three of the five key witnesses, who previously testified Tom was guilty, have died under seemingly mysterious circumstances, raising Claire and Charlie's suspicions. As the trial proceeds, they uncover a massive cover-up perpetrated by one of the military's highest-ranking officials. Also creating problems are the sudden appearance of a resident (Emilio Rivera) of the village where the mass murder took place, who insists Tom was responsible; Embry's romantic involvement with Claire's irresponsible sister Jackie (Amanda Peet), which leads Claire to assume that he leaked details about secrets she has uncovered to the prosecution; and Charlie's falling off the wagon after more than a year of sobriety. The Salvadorian witness identifies an injured Hernandez as the culprit responsible for a bombing incident prior to the massacre. Claire recovers classified medical files from the FBI as evidence of the cover-up. Claire blackmails Marks by threatening to reveal what she knows about the cover-up and asks him to make the case go away; the next day, the U.S. Defense Department has the case thrown out of court due to \\"security reasons\\". Just as Claire is about to celebrate her victory in court, Charlie discovers the truth: Tom had murdered one of the witnesses in front of his family. The widow who witnessed the act described Tom's having tossed his gun from one hand to the other (a habit Tom displayed with keys and other objects throughout the film) and his shooting his gun first using one hand, then the other (revealing his ambidexterity). The match between these descriptions also indicated that Tom committed the massacre and also murdered two of the other key witnesses years prior to his arrest. After Tom overhears Claire talking to Charlie on the phone, a short scuffle between Claire and Tom ensues, during which Claire fears for her life. The Salvadoran witness shoots Tom through the window, and the film ends with Charlie and Claire partnering a new law firm.

Scott of The New York Times thought Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman \\"make a muddled genre exercise seem a lot better than it is. Ms. Judd, always brisk and appealing, is capable of fine acting when the mood strikes [and] Mr. Freeman shows himself, once again, incapable of giving a bad performance.\\" He added Carl Franklin's direction \\"is far from terrible, but it feels singularly uninspired, a flurry of fast, expository scenes and suspense-movie setups.\\" He felt the plot twist \\"renders everything that came before completely nonsensical\\" and concluded, \\"If you figure it out, please let me know. On second thought, don't, but please drop a line to the folks at 20th Century Fox, since I'm sure they're just as baffled as the rest of us.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film three out of four stars and commented, \\"I do like the way director Carl Franklin and writers Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley . . . play both ends against the middle, so that the audience has abundant evidence to believe two completely conflicting theories of what actually happened . . . High Crimes works to keep us involved and make us care . . . The unfolding of various versions of the long-ago massacre is handled by Franklin in flashbacks that show how one camera angle can refute what another angle seems to prove. And if we feel, toward the end, a little whiplashed by the plot manipulations, well, that's what the movie promises and that's what the movie delivers.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said the film \\"has some faults, but it manages to keep its audience either angry or jumpy from start to finish . . . The dramatic focus of High Crimes gets a bit fuzzy in the last half hour - it starts to feel as if some scenes get replayed. Still, the scenes are never dull, and the movie recovers for the big finish. Only one thing is lacking throughout, not a big thing, but big enough to mention. We keep hearing about what great lawyers Claire and Grimes are, but there's no great courtroom scene. In that, High Crimes is too much like real life. It gives us court with no courtroom fireworks.\\" Michael O'Sullivan of the Washington Post said the film \\"satisfies a hunger for the basics: a decent mystery to chew on, a bit of juicy suspense, maybe a plot twist as garnish. The fare is all on the standard menu, but it goes down well just the same. Chalk that up to a cast the director can trust enough to step out of the way and let do their jobs . . . And yes, there's a twist ending, but don't kid yourself that you won't see it coming. Surprising? Maybe not. Satisfying? Not half as much as watching Freeman and Judd, two compelling performers who seem to enjoy each other's company almost as much as we do.\\"Washington Post review Robert Koehler of Variety called the film \\"utterly conventional\\" and Ashley Judd's performance \\"so resolutely humorless and businesslike that Freeman's gruffly affectionate warmth becomes doubly valuable, though not nearly enough to lend this generic project any special character. Most disillusioning is how director Carl Franklin, once known for tense storytelling and unpredictable characters, goes about his task here with a visible lack of inspiration . . . The screenwriting team of Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley has tweaked Joseph Finder's novel considerably . . . Character alterations, refinements, re-locations and plot substitutions produce a rabbit's warren full of holes in an almost laughably complex plot. By the time the third act exhaustedly appears, it's hardly a wonder that some major characters have no idea where other major characters are, or what they're doing.\\" Awards and nominations Morgan Freeman was nominated for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture but lost to Denzel Washington in John Q, the actor's fourth consecutive win in this category. Home media 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the Region 1 DVD on August 27, 2002. The film is in anamorphic widescreen format with audio tracks in English, Spanish, and French and subtitles in English and Spanish. Bonus features include commentary by director Carl Franklin and six featurettes about the making of the film. High Crimes is also available on Blu-ray Disc.

The scheme had been adopted between the academic year of 2002/03 to 2010/11. It enabled students who skipped the HKALE to enter the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong or the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Candidates who received 6 or more \\"A\\"s, attained level 4 or above in English Language and Chinese Language, or obtained \\"C\\" or above in French or Putonghua in the HKCEE, were eligible to take part in the scheme, which might grant them admission to the aforementioned institutions without requiring them to sit for the HKALE. Only 400-500 candidates were eligible to join the scheme annually throughout the implementation of the scheme. Most of them would be admitted to university after they graduated from Form 6. Others, who were studying Form 7 and going to take the HKALE, were usually those who either failed to enrol on their preferred programme via the scheme, or planned to study abroad as some overseas universities may not accept admission applications with HKCEE result only. Some students who were eligible to participate in the scheme, were once given an offer soon after the announcement of HKCEE results, thus allowing them to enter the university immediately rather than after completing Form 6. They were not classified as applicants of the scheme even though they were granted \\"Early Admissions\\", like other EAS applicants. Unlike the latter, those students were usually provided an extra year of bridging courses after they entered the university. After the last HKCEE, which was held in 2010, the scheme was officially abolished. The scheme By the number of actual intakes, the EAS is the biggest subsystem of JUPAS (roughly about 3-5% of total JUPAS intakes). It aims at providing flexibility to outstanding Secondary 6 students to be admitted to the three institutions participating in the scheme. Applicants must achieve the requirements in one sitting of the HKCEE or other qualifying examinations. Applicants will be invited to information sessions held by the three participating universities on specific dates in order to help them in choosing the universities and programmes. On submission, applicants may select up to three programmes per university, making it a total maximum of nine programmes. Applicants will then be invited to attend an interview by respective institutions. Usually only the first programme in the priority order of each institution will provide a subject- based interview but there are various exceptional cases. After the interviews applicants will receive feedbacks from the universities before they make their final choices. A few weeks after the interviews, applicants will be required to draw up a final list of iteration. The list should consist of a maximum of 5 programmes. The programmes in the list are divided into two bands, with the programmes in the first two priority order being Band A and the other three being Band B. Successful applicants will only receive one offer which is the highest priority on their programme list. Theoretically, to prevent domination in some popular \\"elite\\" programmes, hence causing unfairness to mainstream entrants, no programme should admit more the 1/3 EAS students to its total JUPAS intakes. An existence of such system made a few students may end up not being offered to their desired programme, though in most cases they will accept the less-desired offer. Views of Non-EAS students =Unfairness= There are more and more critics on the Scheme who believe imposes an unfairness to Form 7 students (especially to those who have obtained remarkable HKCEE results but could not achieve Level 4 or above in either one or both language subject(s), those who are unable show their talent to the maximum extent in the HKCEE or who do not excel academically but in other areas which are ignored by the scheme) who are required to sit for the HKALE which is much more difficult than the HKCEE. =Form 6 Study= Non-EAS students are likely to face huge pressure as the EAS students are often labelled as 'superior' whereas non-EAS students are categorised as 'inferior' or 'less able'. Non-EAS students have to face the HKALE, which is generally believed to be more tedious. Moreover, EAS entries are counted as entry by JUPAS but not direct admissions, which means, the mainstream applicant will have less chance entering certain programmes, especially programmes which are popular in EAS applicants, like Medicine. Nevertheless, not all eligible students participated in the scheme. Students who left their original secondary schools and went studying in Hang Seng School of Commerce had to give up participating in this programme.

Doubts in suitability for EAS students The general public and many education experts criticise that HKCEE is not an appropriate examination for being a selection criteria of universities' admission procedure. Apart from this, the keen competition for places in the universities would extend to the HKCEE, and Form 5 students (HKCEE candidates) may encounter a high psychological pressure. It is also doubtful whether EAS- benefited students are mature enough to choose suitable university programmes which would probably determine their whole life. Adverse effect on EAS- benefited student (who have already seized places in the universities) learning in Form 6 would also be inevitable.

It is currently managed and co-owned by Simon Property Group. With a gross leasable area (GLA) of , it is the seventh largest shopping mall in the United States. The mall features a food court, several anchor stores, including two Macy's locations, Nordstrom, JCPenney, Dick's Sporting Goods, Burlington Coat Factory, Jo-Ann Fabrics, Marshalls, Dave & Buster's, Japanese supermarket Mitsuwa Marketplace, 255 retailers, multiple full-service restaurants, a fitness center, an AMC Theatres multiplex & a Sears that recently closed in September 2020. History Del Amo Fashion Center has evolved from an amalgamation of several developments on the eastern side of the intersection of Hawthorne Boulevard and Carson Street in Torrance, California by Guilford Glazer (#384 on Forbes Richest 400).Top 10 largest U.S. shopping centers. (The Children's Business List). - Children's Business  HighBeam Research From 1981 to 1992 it was the largest shopping mall in the United States, reaching 3 million ft¬≤ (280,000 m2) in size at its largest. It was eclipsed as the largest with the opening of Mall of America on August 11, 1992. =South side: Broadway/Del Amo Shopping Center= On February 16, 1959, The Broadway opened its store at Hawthorne and Sepulveda boulevards, the ninth in Greater Los Angeles, and over the next two years the open-air Del Amo Shopping Center was built adjacent to it,\\"Broadway's New Del Amo Opens Monday\\", Los Angeles Times, 10 Feb 1959, part I, p. 12 south of Carson Street. Silverwoods opened what was also its ninth L.A.-area store here in November 1960.\\"Ribbon-Cutting\\", Los Angeles Times, 20 Nov 1960, p. 128 Most of the rest of the center opened in stages in early 1961 with additional anchors JCPenney, Sears and Woolworth's. Other stores that opened in 1961 were Lerner's, Leed's Shoes and Ontra Cafeteria; and later C. H. Baker Shoes, Judy's Sportwear, Helen Morgan Women's Shop, The Men's Shop, Tot's Toggery and Suburban Shop, Singer Sewing Shop, Mandel's Shoes, Varon's Jewelry, and Children's Shoe Store. =North side: Bullock's/Del Amo Fashion Square= In 1966, Bullock's opened at a small open-air shopping center it had developed north of Carson Street called Bullock's Fashion Square ‚Äî advertising and editorial in the first years referred to \\"Bullock's Fashion Square in Torrance\\", not Del Amo. Bullock's developed several similarly named Fashion Squares, including ones in Sherman Oaks, La Habra and Santa Ana. I. Magnin, owned by Bullock's, opened a store on March 6, 1967. Desmond's department store was actually the first anchor to open at Fashion Square in 1966.\\"Store Opens at Center\\", Los Angeles Times, April 3, 1966, section J, page 28. In February 1970, Federated Department Stores replaced its Bullock's Realty Corporation, which owned and managed the Fashion Squares, with an organization called Transwest Management;\\"New division will advise retailers\\", Los Angeles Times, 15 February 1970, section K, page 5.

Overview after the merger of the Del Amo Fashion Square (north) and the Del Amo Center (south). Photo taken between 2004 and 2005. In 1971, the center was rebaptized Del Amo Fashion Square and added a $3.75 million, Montgomery Ward, a Ohrbach's and an expanded I. Magnin, as well as a United Artists fourplex theater which later received 2 additional larger auditoriums, and a Woolworth's, both of which were in the Montgomery Ward wing. Glazer acquired neighboring Del Amo Center in 1978. =\\"Marriage of the malls\\"= In November 1981, the two formerly separate centers were officially merged in the \\"marriage of the malls\\" to form the Del Amo Fashion Center, with the opening of a concourse over Carson Street that linked the Del Amo Fashion Square to a new J. W. Robinson's built at the northern end of the Del Amo Center. The existing infrastructure was also renovated at this time and included a food court (the \\"International Food Court\\") and a then-state-of-the-art computerized help system. Del Amo became the largest indoor shopping center in the world. The center continued to evolve over the years as Ohrbach's closed in 1987 and became Swedish style furniture retailer ST√òR. In 1991, the United Artists theater closed when a 9-screen Mann theater opened outside of the mall on Del Amo Circle to the east of J. W. Robinson's. When ST√òR went out of business in the early 1990s, the property was used as a clearance center for ST√òR merchandise before being subdivided into Marshall's and TJ Maxx in the late 1990s. I. Magnin followed in 1989 with part of their store eventually occupied by Old Navy, while Burlington Coat Factory opened in the basement of the former Del Amo Center. J. W. Robinson's became Robinsons-May in 1993. In 1996, following the merger of Bullocks and The Broadway into Macy's West, the former Bullock's became Macy's Apparel store, while the Macy's south store (where the Broadway resided) was closed. At first, the company attempted to sell the building to Bloomingdale's, but after three years reopened it in July 1999 as a Macy's home and furniture gallery, its largest stand-alone home furnishing store in Southern California. The 50,000 square foot ground floor became a Jo-Ann's fabric and crafts store. In 1997, Woolworth's became Venator in accordance with the chain's renaming. Faced with a change in consumer shopping patterns, the consolidation of the department store industry, the existence of too many malls fragmenting the greater Los Angeles retail marketplace, lack of highway access and competition from the neighboring Nordstrom-anchored South Bay Galleria that opened in 1985, Del Amo began to suffer. In 2000, the Mann theater closed in accordance with the chain's folding and became LA Fitness. The same year, a Barnes & Noble store was constructed in the mall's northwest parking lot. Montgomery Ward dealt another blow when it closed following the chain's bankruptcy in June 2001 and failed to become Target. This resulted in the closure of an entire wing of the mall, including Venator. =Mills renovation= In early 2002, The Mills Corporation acquired Del Amo Fashion Center from Glazer's family for $420 million (USD).Mills buys Del Amo Fashion Center for $442 million Subsequently, Mills sold a half-interest in the property to institutional investor funds managed by JPMorgan Fleming, before, in June 2005, initiating a $160 million redevelopment including demolition and redevelopment of the former northeastern wing where Montgomery Ward had been located, the renovation of 670,000 ft¬≤ (62,000 m¬≤) of existing space and the addition of another 100,000 ft¬≤ (9,300 m¬≤). Robinsons-May converted to a second full-line Macy's West on September 9, 2006 called Macy's South, while Macy's Apparel was renamed Macy's North. 300x300px The new open-air lifestyle center opened on September 14, 2006, bringing new specialty stores, dining, entertainment, a Lucky Strike Lanes (now occupied by Old Navy as of 2014), and an AMC Theatres 18-screen multiplex to the mall. Crate & Barrel opened a home furnishings store along the mall perimeter in spring 2007, replacing an IHOP restaurant and a Sushi Boy store. In 2007, The Mills Corporation was jointly acquired by Simon Property Group and Farallon Capital Management. Simon assumed management of Del Amo Fashion Center at this time. In April 2008, the mall's website was placed under the Simon.com format along with sister Simon/Mills malls, like Ontario Mills, Hilltop Mall, the Block at Orange and Great Mall. =Simon expansion= After increasing its ownership stake in the property, Simon presented preliminary plans to revamp Del Amo. The plans were considered vague and underwhelming by Torrance residents. In late 2012, detailed plans to redevelop Del Amo on a much larger scale were unveiled. The mall's north end would be demolished entirely, replaced by a new two-level wing of luxury shops. In conjunction with the renovation, Nordstrom announced it would relocate its store from the South Bay Galleria in nearby Redondo Beach to Del Amo, anchoring the new wing. The first phase of the project, redeveloping the wing of shops above Carson Street into a new food court, began in 2013. Work was completed in the spring of the following year, as retailers began vacating the north wing to make way for the renovation. Plans to consolidate the mall's three Macy's stores into two were confirmed in 2014, with Macy's consolidating its standalone Macy's Home store into the existing Macy's Men's store. Simon then traded ownership of the Macy's Men's building for the Macy's Home building. Dick's Sporting Goods moved into the former Macy's Home space in early 2017. Interior of the Fashion Wing at the Del Amo Fashion Center, looking south from Nordstrom After 18 months of construction, the northern portion of the mall officially opened on October 9, 2015. A medical building on the north end of the property and the existing one-story northern section were replaced with a two-story Fashion Wing, featuring a brighter and open \\"beach elegance\\" aesthetic to bring in more natural light and a mid-century modern look. The wing featured a mix of new-to-market retailers and holdovers from the former north end, including luxury retailers BOSS Hugo Boss, Kate Spade New York, Tumi, and Brooks Brothers; and flagship stores for Uniqlo, H&M;, Express, Zara, and Victoria's Secret. Several new and relocated restaurants fronted the new wing: local chains EMC Seafood & Raw Bar, Lemonade, Popbar, and FRIDA; Din Tai Fung, a prototype Brio Tuscan Grille, and a relocated Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que. The south end of the property experienced minor renovations in line with the more elaborate north end changes, including signs delineating the wing \\"Del Amo Shopping Center\\" with a focus on general-purpose retail. In 2018, renovation plans were completed to replace a significant portion of the south end's inline retail space with a Dave & Buster's and a relocated Marshalls store. Outback Steakhouse, which was displaced by construction on the south end, reopened in the Outdoor Village on July 7, 2018. Mitsuwa Marketplace will open in the old TJ Maxx (which closed in 2016) and Marshall's building that is really part of the lifestyle outdoor village in November 2019. During March 2019, there was a Foodbeast Dream Machine vending machine where one may post a selfie in exchange for free noodles and other prizes. On July 1, 2020, it was announced that Sears would be closing after nearly 61 years of serving the South Bay. This store along with 28 other stores nationwide shuttered on September 6, 2020. In film The Del Amo Fashion Center was a central location and plot element of the 1997 Quentin Tarantino film Jackie Brown, though most of the mall scenes took place at a fictional department store in the mall, called Billingsley, which was actually just the north Macy's store with a prop Billingsley sign put up over the Macy's sign. In addition, the mall was prominently featured in Martha Coolidge's Valley Girl, the mall's abandoned Montgomery Ward wing was used as the \\"Saguaro Square Mall\\" backdrop for the 2003 film Bad Santa with a fictional department store called Chamberlain's put up in the vacant Montgomery Ward building, and the mall was also used for scenes in the comedy film Why Him?. The mall was also used in Season 1, Episode 2 of the show Euphoria on HBO. The Barnes & Noble store located in the northwest parking lot of the mall was the location used for the chain's 2012 holiday TV ad.

It follows the successful completion of S phase, during which the cell‚Äôs DNA is replicated. G2 phase ends with the onset of prophase, the first phase of mitosis in which the cell‚Äôs chromatin condenses into chromosomes. G2 phase is a period of rapid cell growth and protein synthesis during which the cell prepares itself for mitosis. Curiously, G2 phase is not a necessary part of the cell cycle, as some cell types (particularly young Xenopus embryos and some cancers)) proceed directly from DNA replication to mitosis. Though much is known about the genetic network which regulates G2 phase and subsequent entry into mitosis, there is still much to be discovered concerning its significance and regulation, particularly in regards to cancer. One hypothesis is that the growth in G2 phase is regulated as a method of cell size control. Fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) has been previously shown to employ such a mechanism, via Cdr2-mediated spatial regulation of Wee1 activity. Though Wee1 is a fairly conserved negative regulator of mitotic entry, no general mechanism of cell size control in G2 has yet been elucidated. Biochemically, the end of G2 phase occurs when a threshold level of active cyclin B1/CDK1 complex, also known as Maturation promoting factor (MPF) has been reached. The activity of this complex is tightly regulated during G2. In particular, the G2 checkpoint arrests cells in G2 in response to DNA damage through inhibitory regulation of CDK1.  Homologous recombinational repair  During mitotic S phase, DNA replication produces two nearly identical sister chromatids. DNA double-strand breaks that arise after replication has progressed or during the G2 phase can be repaired before cell division occurs (M-phase of the cell cycle). Thus, during the G2 phase, double-strand breaks in one sister chromatid may be repaired by homologous recombinational repair using the other intact sister chromatid as template. End of G2/entry into mitosis Mitotic entry is determined by a threshold level of active cyclin-B1/CDK1 complex, also known as cyclin-B1/Cdc2 or the maturation promoting factor (MPF). Active cyclin-B1/CDK1 triggers irreversible actions in early mitosis, including centrosome separation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and spindle assembly. In vertebrates, there are five cyclin B isoforms (B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5), but the specific role of each of these isoforms in regulating mitotic entry is still unclear. It is known that cyclin B1 can compensate for loss of both cyclin B2 (and vice versa in Drosophila). Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains six B-type cyclins (Clb1-6), with Clb2 being the most essential for function. In both vertebrates and S. cerevisiae, it is speculated that the presence of multiple B-type cyclins allows different cyclins to regulate different portions of the G2/M transition while also making the transition robust to perturbations. Subsequent discussions will focus on the spatial and temporal activation of cyclin B1/CDK in mammalian cells, but similar pathways are applicable in both other metazoans and in S. cerevisiae. = Cyclin B1 synthesis and degradation = Cyclin B1 levels are suppressed throughout G1 and S phases by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase which targets cyclin B1 for proteolysis. Transcription begins at the end of S phase after DNA replication, in response to phosphorylation of transcription factors such as NF-Y, FoxM1 and B-Myb by upstream G1 and G1/S cyclin-CDK complexes. = Regulation of cyclin-B1/CDK1 activity = Increased levels of cyclin B1 cause rising levels of cyclin B1-CDK1 complexes throughout G2, but the complex remains inactive prior to the G2/M transition due to inhibitory phosphorylation by the Wee1 and Myt1 kinases. Wee1is localized primarily to the nucleus and acts on the Tyr15 site, while Myt1 is localized to the outer surface of the ER and acts predominantly on the Thr14 site. The effects of Wee1 and Myt1 are counteracted by phosphatases in the cdc25 family, which remove the inhibitory phosphates on CDK1 and thus convert the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex to its fully activated form, MPF. This diagram illustrates the feedback loops underlying the G2/M transition. Cyclin-B1/CDK1 activates Plk and inactivates Wee1 and Myt1. Activated Plk activates cdc25. Activation of Cdc25 and inactivation of Wee1/Myt1 lead to further activation of Cyclin-B1/CDK1. Also shown is the putative role of cyclin-A/CDK2 and Cdc25A as initial activators of the feedback loop, discussed in a later section. Active cyclinB1-CDK1 phosphorylates and modulates the activity of Wee1 and the Cdc25 isoforms A and C. Specifically, CDK1 phosphorylation inhibits Wee1 kinase activity, activates Cdc25C phosphatase activity via activating the intermediate kinase PLK1, and stabilizes Cdc25A. Thus, CDK1 forms a positive feedback loop with Cdc25 and a double negative feedback loop with Wee1 (essentially a net positive feedback loop). = Positive feedback and switch- like activation = This graph illustrates the stable equilibria for cyclin-B1/CDK1 activity at varying cyclin B1 concentrations, with the threshold of cyclin B concentration for entering mitosis higher than the threshold for exiting mitosis. These positive feedback loops encode a hysteretic bistable switch in CDK1 activity relative to cyclin B1 levels (see figure). This switch is characterized by two distinct stable equilibria over a bistable region of cyclin B1 concentrations. One equilibrium corresponds to interphase and is characterized by inactivity of Cyclin-B1/CDK1 and Cdc25, and a high level of Wee1 and Myt1 activity. The other equilibrium corresponds to M-phase and is characterized by high activity of Cyclin-B1/CDK1 and Cdc25, and low Wee1 and Myt1 activity. Within the range of bistability, a cell‚Äôs state depends upon whether it was previously in interphase or M-phase: the threshold concentration for entering M-phase is higher than the minimum concentration that will sustain M-phase activity once a cell has already exited interphase. Scientists have both theoretically and empirically validated the bistable nature of the G2/M transition. The Novak-Tyson model shows that the differential equations modelling the cyclin-B/CDK1-cdc25-Wee1-Myt1 feedback loop admit two stable equilibria over a range of cyclin-B concentrations. Experimentally, bistability has been validated by blocking endogenous cyclin B1 synthesis and titrating interphase and M-phase cells with varying concentrations of non-degradable cyclin B1. These experiments show that the threshold concentration for entering M-phase is higher than the threshold for exiting M-phase: nuclear envelope break-down occurs between 32-40 nm cyclin-B1 for cells exiting interphase, while the nucleus remains disintegrated at concentrations above 16-24 nm in cells already in M-phase. This bistable, hysteretic switch is physiologically necessary for at least three reasons. First, the G2/M transition signals the initiation of several events, such as chromosome condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown, that markedly change the morphology of the cell and are only viable in dividing cells. It is therefore essential that cyclin-B1/CDK1 activation occurs in a switch-like manner; that is, cells should rapidly settle into a discrete M-phase state after the transition, and should not persist in a continuum of intermediate states (e.g., with a partially decomposed nuclear envelope). This requirement is satisfied by the sharp discontinuity separating the interphase and M-phase equilibrium levels of CDK1 activity; as the cyclin-B concentration increases beyond the activation threshold, the cell rapidly switches to the M-phase equilibrium. Secondly, it is also vital that the G2/M transition occur unidirectionally, or only once per cell cycle Biological systems are inherently noisy, and small fluctuations in cyclin B1 concentrations near the threshold for the G2/M transition should not cause the cell to switch back and forth between interphase and M-phase states. This is ensured by the bistable nature of the switch: after the cell transitions to the M-phase state, small decreases in the concentration of cyclin B do not cause the cell to switch back to interphase. Finally, the continuation of the cell cycle requires persisting oscillations in cyclin-B/CDK1 activity as the cell and its descendants transition in and out of M-phase. Negative feedback provides one essential element of this long-term oscillation: cyclin-B/CDK activates APC/C, which causes degradation of cyclin-B from metaphase onwards, restoring CDK1 to its inactive state. However, simple negative feedback loops lead to damped oscillations that eventually settle on a steady state. Kinetic models show that negative feedback loops coupled with bistable positive feedback motifs can lead to persistent, non-damped oscillations (see relaxation oscillator) of the kind required for long-term cell cycling. = Positive feedback = The positive feedback loop mentioned above, in which cyclin-B1/CDK1 promotes its own activation by inhibiting Wee1 and Myst1 and activating cdc25, does not inherently include a ‚Äútrigger‚Äù mechanism to initiate the feedback loop. Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting a more important role for cyclin A2/CDK complexes in regulating the initiation of this switch. Cyclin A2/CDK2 activity begins in early S phase and increases during G2. Cdc25B has been shown to dephosphorylate Tyr15 on CDK2 in early-to-mid G2 in a manner similar to the aforementioned CDK1 mechanism. Downregulation of cyclin A2 in U2OS cells delays cyclin-B1/CDK1 activation by increasing Wee1 activity and lowering Plk1 and Cdc25C activity. However, cyclin A2/CDK complexes do not function strictly as activators of cyclin B1/CDK1 in G2, as CDK2 has been shown to be required for activation of the p53-independent G2 checkpoint activity, perhaps through a stabilizing phosphorylation on Cdc6. CDK2-/- cells also have aberrantly high levels of Cdc25A. Cyclin A2/CDK1 has also been shown to mediate proteasomal destruction of Cdc25B. These pathways are often deregulated in cancer. = Spatial regulation = In addition to the bistable and hysteretic aspects of cyclin B1-CDK1 activation, regulation of subcellular protein localization also contributes to the G2/M transition. Inactive cyclin B1-CDK1 accumulates in the cytoplasm, begins to be activated by cytoplasmic cdc25, and then is rapidly sequestered into the nucleus during prophase (as it is further activated). In mammals, cyclin B1/CDK1 translocation to the nucleus is activated by phosphorylation of five serine sites on cyclin B1's cytoplasmic retention site (CRS): S116, S26, S128, S133, and S147. In Xenopus laevis, cyclin B1 contains four analogous CRS serine phosphorylation sites (S94, S96, S101, and S113) indicating that this mechanism is highly conserved. Nuclear export is also inactivated by phosphorylation of cyclin B1's nuclear export signal (NES). The regulators of these phosphorylation sites are still largely unknown but several factors have been identified, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), PLK1, and CDK1 itself. Upon reaching some threshold level of phosphorylation, translocation of cyclin B1/CDK1 to the nucleus is extremely rapid. Once in the nucleus, cyclin B1/CDK1 phosphorylates many targets in preparation for mitosis, including histone H1, nuclear lamins, centrosomal proteins, and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs). The subcellular localization of cdc25 also shifts from the cytosol to the nucleus during prophase. This is accomplished via removal of nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-obscuring phosphates and phosphorylation of the nuclear export signal. It is thought that the simultaneous transport of cdc25 and cyclin-B1/CDK1 into the nucleus amplify the switch-like nature of the transition by increasing the effective concentrations of the proteins.  G2/M DNA damage arrest  Cells respond to DNA damage or incompletely replicated chromosomes in G2 phase by delaying the G2/M transition so as to prevent attempts to segregate damaged chromosomes. DNA damage is detected by the kinases ATM and ATR, which activate Chk1, an inhibitory kinase of Cdc25. Chk1 inhibits Cdc25 activity both directly and by promoting its exclusion from the nucleus. The net effect is an increase in the threshold of cyclin B1 required to initiate the hysteretic transition to M-phase, effectively stalling the cell in G2 until the damage is repaired by mechanisms such as homology- directed repair (see above). Long-term maintenance of the G2 arrest is also mediated by p53, which is stabilized in response to DNA damage. CDK1 is directly inhibited by three transcriptional targets of p53: p21, Gadd45, and 14-3-3œÉ. Inactive Cyclin B1/CDK1 is sequestered in the nucleus by p21, while active Cyclin B1/CDK1 complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3œÉ. Gadd45 disrupts the binding of Cyclin B1 and CDK1 through direct interaction with CDK1. P53 also directly transcriptionally represses CDK1.  Medical relevance  Mutations in several genes involved in the G2/M transition are implicated in many cancers. Overexpression of both cyclin B and CDK1, oftentimes downstream of loss of tumor suppressors such as p53, can cause an increase in cell proliferation. Experimental approaches to mitigate these changes include both pharmacological inhibition of CDK1 and downregulation of cyclin B1 expression (e.g., via siRNA). Other attempts to modulate the G2/M transition for chemotherapy applications have focused on the DNA damage checkpoint. Pharmacologically bypassing the G2/M checkpoint via inhibition of Chk1 has been shown to enhance cytotoxicity of other chemotherapy drugs. Bypassing the checkpoint leads to the rapid accumulation of deleterious mutations, which is thought to drive the cancerous cells into apoptosis. Conversely, attempts to prolong the G2/M arrest have also been shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of drugs like doxorubicin. These approaches remain in clinical and pre-clinical phases of research.

Time of reign Bopearachchi has suggested that Menander II reigned c. 90‚Äì85 BC, whereas R. C. Senior has suggested c. 65 BC. In that case, Menander II ruled remaining Indo-Greek territories in Gandhara after the invasion of Maues. Relations to other kings Menander II Dikaios may have belonged to the dynasty of Menander I Soter, the greatest of the Indo-Greek kings. It was long believed that there was only one king named Menander (see discussion under Menander I) as their portraits were rather similar and Menander II seems to have been a devout Buddhist, just as Menander I was, according to the ancient Buddhist scripture the Milindapanha. Menander II bareheaded. On the other hand, the name Menander could well have been popular in the Indo-Greek kingdom, and the coins of Menander II are not very like those of Menander I nor of those other kings (such as Strato I) who are believed to have belonged to his dynasty. R. C. Senior links Menander II with the Indo-Greek king Amyntas, with whom he shares several monograms and also facial features such as a pointed nose and receding chin. He also suggests a close relation to the semi-Scythian king Artemidorus, son of Maues, since their coins use similar types and are often found together. There is a small possibility that Menander II, rather than Menander I, is actually the Buddhist Greek king referred to in the Milinda Panha. This point is unsolved however, since Greek sources (Plutarch (Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6)) relate that the great conqueror Menander I is the one who received the honour of burial in what could be interpreted as Buddhist stupas. More likely, Menander I may indeed have first supported Buddhism, like the other Indo-Greek kings, and was probably the protagonist of the Milindapanha, on account of his described fame, whereas Menander II, a minor king, may have wholeheartedly embraced Buddhism, as exemplified by his coins. Coins of Menander II halo bearing wreath and palm, probably Nike. The Kharoshthi legend reads MAHARAJASA DHARMIKASA MENADRASA (King Menander, follower of the Dharma). Menander II with Nike making a blessing gesture and seated lion. The lion on Menander II's coins is similar to those on the Pillars of Ashoka: seated posture, protruding tongue, mane (detail of Indian- standard square coin of Menander II). The coins of Menander II bear the mention \\"Menander the Just\\", and \\"King of the Dharma\\" in Kharoshti, suggesting that he adopted the Buddhist faith. Menander II struck only Indian silver. These depict the king in diadem or helmet of the type of Menander I, with a number of reverses: a king on horseback, Nike and a sitting Zeus of the type of Antialkidas and Amyntas Nikator, but with an eight-spoked Buddhist wheel instead of the small elephant. His bronzes feature Athena standing, with spear and palm-branch, shield at her feet, making a benediction gesture with the right hand, similar to the Buddhist vitarka mudra. Other varieties feature a king performing the same gesture. On the reverse is a lion, symbol of Buddhism, as also seen on the pillars of the Mauryan King Ashoka. In general, the coins of Menander II are quite few, which tends to indicate a rather small rule. A contemporary king to represent the Buddhist lion on his coins is the Indo-Scythian king Maues, around 85 BC. File:Menander II spearholder.jpgMenander II as a spearholder.

Commonly referred to as ETA, the company is headquartered in Grenchen, Switzerland and is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Swatch Group. Though ETA was founded by Eterna in 1856 some part of its production line can be traced back to the 1793 founding of Fabriques d‚ÄôHorlogerie de Fontainemelon (FHF) by David Benguerel, Isaac Benguerel, Fran√ßois Humbert-Droz and Julien Humbert-Droz. Through a series of mergers, ETA has become the largest manufacturer of Swiss watch movements and controls a virtual monopoly over their production and supply. ETA has undergone several Swiss government investigations due to its market position. To resolve the concerns of Swiss government regulators, ETA has entered into an agreement that governs certain business practices. Description ETA designs and manufactures mechanical and automatic watches, watch movements and watch √©bauches. Although the company produces finished watches and movements, ETA specializes in the production of √©bauche movements used both in watches of sister Swatch Group subsidiary brands and in the watches of competitors, including brands owned by Compagnie Financi√®re Richemont S.A. and others. With the exception of hairsprings manufactured by sister company Nivarox, ETA maintains vertical control over the manufacturing of all of the components required to create a watch movement and therefore is considered a true manufacture d'horlogerie. History Electronic quartz movement by ETA. ETA is the result of successive consolidation of the Swiss watch industry, a combination of several former Swiss watch movement manufacturers including Valjoux, Peseux and Lemania. In 1856 at Grenchen, Urs Schild, a schoolmaster, and Dr. Girard set up a watch movement (√©bauche) factory which eventually became Eterna. In 1926, ETA AS (the movement branch of Eterna, founded in 1896) and FHF (founded in 1793) took part in the creation of √âbauches Ltd. In 1978 AS and ETA merged and in 1985 ETA took in all the activities done before by √âbauches Ltd and FHF (both part of SMH/Swatch Group).. SSIH was founded in 1930 through the amalgamation of Omega and Tissot. By consolidating companies that produced high-quality movements and a number of watch brands, SSIH gradually established a strong position in the Swiss watch industry. At the time, both SSIH and ASUAG held a number of well-established Swiss watch brands. ASUAG had been founded in 1931. ASUAG expanded through the purchase of companies that made movement-blanks and a number of finished watch manufacturers that were subsequently brought together under the subsidiary General Watch Co (GWC). In the 1930s, both ASUAG and SSIH entered into complementary research and development programs to combat a severe economic crisis. Following repeated crises in the Swiss watch industry, by the 1970s both ASUAG and SSIH were again in trouble. Foreign competition and the mass production of cheap new electronic products were taking over the market. Eventually, both ASUAG and SSIH faced bankruptcy. During all those years of crisis, and restructuring, since 1978, Dr. Ernst Thomke had been at the helm of ETA SA, and also had become CEO of Ebauches SA and appointed on the Board of Directors of ASUAG. He became SMH's first CEO, position he held until 1991. At that time, Nicolas G. Hayek, as newly elected Chairman of the Board and main shareholder had already become the only person of reference. In 1998, Swiss Corporation for Microelectronics and Watchmaking Industries Ltd (Soci√©t√© de Micro√©lectronique et d'Horlogerie or SMH), founded in 1983 through the merger Swiss watchmakers ASUAG and SSIH, was renamed the Swatch Group. Products = ETA 2824-2 = Hamilton Khaki Field Officer H70615133 with Swiss ETA 2824-2 movement One workhorse of the ETA mechanical line is the ETA 2824-2, The 2824 is an automatic winding, twenty-five jewel movement, available in four executions or grades: Standard, Elaborated (improved), Top and Chronometer.. The key components which differ at the line of demarcation between Elaborated and Top are the shock protection system (Elaborate=Etachoc/Top=Incabloc), balance wheel (Elaborate=Brass/Top=Glucydur) and the hairspring (Elaborate=Nivarox 2/Top=Anachron). In contrast, since the addition of the \\"-2\\" at the end of the movement number, there has been no difference between the standard and the chronometer grades in terms of the regulator mechanism, both being Etachron. To illustrate the differences in accuracy garnered by the successive grades, consider the following specifications: * the Standard grade is adjusted in two positions with an average rate of +/‚àí12 seconds/day, with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí30 seconds; * the Elaborated grade is adjusted in three positions with an average rate of +/‚àí7 seconds/day, with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí20 seconds; * while the Top grade is adjusted in five positions with an average rate of +/‚àí4 seconds/day, with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí15 seconds. The Chronometer grade must meet strict standards prescribed by the COSC. Chronometer grade movements are serial numbered, as that is a requirement of the certification authority. Moreover, the degree of decoration on the movement's parts, generally only an aesthetic improvement, increases as well with the grade.. = ETA 2892 = The ETA 2892.A2 is a newer design dating to the 1970s and fitted with top quality components. An automatic winding, twenty-one (21) jewel movement, the 2892 is available in three executions or grades: Elaborated, Top and Chronometer. The key components which differ at the line of demarcation between Elaborated and Top are the balance wheel (Elaborate=Brass/Top=Glucydur) and the hairspring (Elaborate=Nivarox 2/Top=Anachron). In contrast, since the addition of the \\"-2\\" at the end of the movement number, there has been no difference between the standard and the chronometer grades in terms of the regulator mechanism, both being Etachron. The degree of decoration on the movement's parts also increases with the grade.. To illustrate the differences in accuracy garnered by the successive grades, consider the following specifications: * Elaborated grade is adjusted in four positions with an average rate of +/‚àí5 seconds/day, with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí20 seconds; * Top grade is adjusted in five positions with an average rate of +/‚àí4 seconds/day, with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí15 seconds. * Chronometer an average rate of ‚àí4/+6 with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí5 seconds - standards prescribed by the COSC. The wider range for the chronometer grade is designed to take into account the differences in a watch's rate between static positions, as when the tests are performed, and the dynamic positions as when a watch is actually worn. Chronometer grade movements are serial numbered. The ETA 2892.A2 is usually found in the more expensive and prestigious watches and brands, and owing to its relatively slim height of 3.60 mm, the 2892.A2 is a favorite of watch brands that market complicated movements such as Breitling with its trademark chronograph (stop watches). The 2892 is also used in certain International Watch Company watches, including newer Ingenieur models introduced in 2013. = The Omega coaxial based upon an ETA movement = Omega's Seamaster line of watches (including the Seamaster Professional 300) previously used an embellished version of the ETA 2892.A2 known as the Omega 1120. Later versions of the Seamaster used a proprietary coaxial escapement invented by George Daniels, an English horologist, and exclusively marketed by Omega, a sister company of ETA. The movement with the coaxial escapement is known as the Omega 2500 series and is derived from the ETA 2892. Later versions of the Seamaster \\"Planet Ocean\\" migrated from the Omega 2500 to a different coaxial escapement known as the Omega 8500 series with extremely high magnetic resistance. Current Seamaster Professional 300 models continue to use the Omega 2500 \\"D\\" series movements. = Valjoux 7750 = ETA/Valjoux 7750 automatic movement The Valjoux 7750 a/k/a ETA 7750 an extremely popular movement used in the majority of mechanical chronograph watches on the market in 2004. The Valjoux 7750 uses a three-plane cam system, the coulisse-lever escapement, rather than the traditional chronograph mechanism, the column wheel. It is constructed of a mainplate, calendar plate, and chronograph top plate. Levers push a cam back and forth, driving the stopwatch mechanism of the Valjoux 7750. In the 1980s, many companies began using the Valjoux 7750 because it was easier to mass- produce and distribute in high-volume. The system and movement were developed by Edmond Capt in 1970, as a fully integrated self-winding mechanism with quick-set day/date based on the Valjoux 7733..\\"CHRONOGRAPHY 5: THE VALJOUX 7750\\", MARK MCARTHUR CHRISTIE, wornandwound.com The movement is an automatic winding, twenty-five (25) jewel movement, which can be fitted with a variety of features including the triple date (day, date, month and moon phase) or a variety of two and three register models with totalizers or counters for minutes, seconds and hours. It is available in three executions or grades: Elaborated, Top and Chronometer. The key components which differ at the line of demarcation between Elaborated and Top are the pallet stones, balance wheel & hairspring and the regulator mechanism. To illustrate the differences in accuracy garnered by the successive grades, consider the following specifications: * Elaborated grade is adjusted in three positions with an average rate of +/‚àí5 seconds/day with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí15 seconds; * Top grade is adjusted in five positions with an average rate of +/‚àí4 seconds/day with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí15 seconds. * Chronometer grade must meet strict standards prescribed by the COSC: an average rate of ‚àí4/+6 with a maximum daily variation of +/‚àí5 seconds.. Cartel investigation In 2003 the Swiss Competition Commission launched an investigation into the business practices of ETA SA after Nicholas Hayek, then chairman of ETA parent The Swatch Group Ltd., announced in 2002 that ETA would shortly stop supplying √©bauches (partial watch movements) to companies outside The Swatch Group. Competitors complained that this would effectively put them out of business. Hayek countered that Swiss watch making companies must begin to invest in their own movement-making capabilities because it was detrimental to the long term health of the Swiss watchmaking industry to rely on one supplier, ETA, for the bulk of √©bauche and parts production. The Swiss Competition Commission ordered ETA to continue supplying √©bauches to companies outside The Swatch Group during the investigation. In 2005 the Swiss Competition Commission concluded its investigation and ordered ETA to continue delivering √©bauches and parts at the then current levels until 2008, after which ETA was allowed to gradually reduce deliveries until 2010. The Commission had found that for √©bauches in the price range up to US$250, there were no real alternatives and ETA's decision to stop deliveries was a breach of Swiss law pertaining to cartels. Although the 2005 decision has spurred some watchmakers to invest in the personnel and equipment necessary to produce movements in-house, heavy reliance on ETA continues to the present day. The original finding has been extended, with the Swiss Competition Commission ordering in July 2012 that based on 2010 supply levels, ETA may reduce the level of supplied movements by 30 percent in 2014-2015, 50 percent in 2016-2017 and by 70 percent by 2018-2019. The number of Nivarox products that must be offered will be reduced gradually, dropping by 70 percent by the year 2023. ETA hopes to eventually reach a market position where they are allowed to freely choose to supply or not to supply parts and √©bauches to competitors based solely on ETA's discretion.

Having been predicted by Austrian astrophysicist Thomas Gold in 1948, its existence was first demonstrated experimentally by British physicist David Kemp in 1978, and otoacoustic emissions have since been shown to arise through a number of different cellular and mechanical causes within the inner ear. Studies have shown that OAEs disappear after the inner ear has been damaged, so OAEs are often used in the laboratory and the clinic as a measure of inner ear health. Broadly speaking, there are two types of otoacoustic emissions: spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs), which occur without external stimulation, and evoked otoacoustic emissions (EOAEs), which require an evoking stimulus. Mechanism of occurrence OAEs are considered to be related to the amplification function of the cochlea. In the absence of external stimulation, the activity of the cochlear amplifier increases, leading to the production of sound. Several lines of evidence suggest that, in mammals, outer hair cells are the elements that enhance cochlear sensitivity and frequency selectivity and hence act as the energy sources for amplification. One theory is that they act to increase the discriminability of signal variations in continuous noise by lowering the masking effect of its cochlear amplification. Types =Spontaneous= Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAE)s are sounds that are emitted from the ear without external stimulation and are measurable with sensitive microphones in the external ear canal. At least one SOAE can be detected in approximately 35‚Äì50% of the population. The sounds are frequency-stable between 500 Hz and 4,500 Hz to have unstable volumes between -30 dB SPL and +10 dB SPL. The majority of the people are unaware of their SOAEs; portions of 1‚Äì9% however perceive a SOAE as an annoying tinnitus. =Evoked= Evoked otoacoustic emissions are currently evoked using three different methodologies. * Stimulus-frequency OAEs (SFOAEs) are measured during the application of a pure-tone stimulus and are detected by the vectorial difference between the stimulus waveform and the recorded waveform (which consists of the sum of the stimulus and the OAE). * Transient- evoked OAEs (TEOAEs or TrOAEs) are evoked using a click (broad frequency range) or toneburst (brief duration pure tone) stimulus. The evoked response from a click covers the frequency range up to around 4 kHz, while a toneburst will elicit a response from the region that has the same frequency as the pure tone. * Distortion-product OAEs (DPOAEs) are evoked using a pair of primary tones f_1 and f_2 with particular intensity (usually either 65‚Äì55 dB SPL or 65 for both) and ratio (f_1\\\\mbox{ }:\\\\mbox{ }f_2). The evoked responses from these stimuli occur at frequencies (f_{dp}) mathematically related to the primary frequencies, with the two most prominent being f_{dp}=2f_1-f_2 (the \\"cubic\\" distortion tone, most commonly used for hearing screening), because they produce the most robust emission, and f_{dp}=f_2-f_1 (the \\"quadratic\\" distortion tone, or simple difference tone). Clinical importance Otoacoustic emissions are clinically important because they are the basis of a simple, non-invasive test for cochlear hearing loss in newborn babies and in children or adults who are unable or unwilling to cooperate during conventional hearing tests. Many western countries now have national programmes for the universal hearing screening of newborn babies. Newborn hearing screening is state-mandated prior to hospital discharge in the United States. Periodic early childhood hearing screenings program are also utilizing OAE technology. One excellent example has been demonstrated by the Early Childhood Hearing Outreach Initiative at the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management (NCHAM) at Utah State University, which has helped hundreds of Early Head Start programs across the United States implement OAE screening and follow-up practices in those early childhood educational settings.Eiserman, W., & Shisler, L. (2010). Identifying Hearing Loss in Young Children: Technology Replaces the Bell. Zero to Three Journal, 30, No.5, 24-28.Eiserman, W., Shisler, L., & Foust, T. (2008). Hearing screening in Early Childcare Settings. The ASHA Leader. November 4, 2008. The primary screening tool is a test for the presence of a click-evoked OAE. Otoacoustic emissions also assist in differential diagnosis of cochlear and higher level hearing losses (e.g., auditory neuropathy). The relationships between otoacoustic emissions and tinnitus have been explored. Several studies suggest that in about 6% to 12% of normal-hearing persons with tinnitus and SOAEs, the SOAEs are at least partly responsible for the tinnitus. Studies have found that some subjects with tinnitus display oscillating or ringing EOAEs, and in these cases, it is hypothesized that the oscillating EOAEs and tinnitus are related to a common underlying pathology rather than the emissions being the source of the tinnitus. In conjunction with audiometric testing, OAE testing can be completed to determine changes in the responses. Studies have found that exposure to noise can cause a decline in OAE responses. OAEs are a measurement of the activity of outer hair cells in the cochlea, and noise- induced hearing loss occurs as a result of damage to the outer hair cells in the cochlea. Therefore, the damage or loss of some outer hair cells will likely show up on OAEs before showing up on the audiogram. Studies have shown that for some individuals with normal hearing that have been exposed to excessive sound levels, fewer, reduced, or no OAEs can be present. This could be an indication of noise-induced hearing loss before it is seen on an audiogram. In one study, a group of subjects with noise exposure was compared to a group of subjects with normal audiograms and a history of noise exposure, as well as a group of military recruits with no history of noise exposure and a normal audiogram. They found that an increase in severity of the noise- induced hearing loss resulted in OAEs with a smaller range of emissions and reduced amplitude of the emissions. The loss of emissions due to noise exposure was found to occur in mostly the high frequencies, and it was more prominent in the groups that had noise exposure in comparison to the non- exposed group. It was found that OAEs were more sensitive to identifying noise-induced cochlear damage than pure tone audiometry. In conclusion, the study identified OAEs as a method for helping with detection of the early onset of noise-induced hearing loss. It has been found that distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE's) have provided the most information for detecting hearing loss in high frequencies when compared to transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). This is an indication that DPOAE's can help with detecting an early onset of noise-induced hearing loss. A study measuring audiometric thresholds and DPOAEs among individuals in the military showed that there was a decrease in DPOAEs after noise exposure, but did not show a shift in audiometric threshold. This supports OAEs as predicting early signs of noise damage. Biometric importance In 2009, Stephen Beeby of the University of Southampton led research into utilizing otoacoustic emissions for biometric identification. Devices equipped with a microphone could detect these subsonic emissions and potentially identify an individual, thereby providing access to the device, without the need of a traditional password.Telegraph.co.uk, April 25, 2009, \\"Ear noise can be used as identification\\" It is speculated, however, that colds, medication, trimming one's ear hair, or recording and playing back a signal to the microphone could subvert the identification process.IEEE Spectrum Online, April 29, 2009, \\"Your Ear Noise as Computer Password \\" See also *Auditory brainstem response *Entoptic phenomenon *Maryanne Amacher, a composer who used this phenomenon in her music *Pure tone audiometry *The Hum References Further reading *M.S.

Typically, audiometric tests determine a subject's hearing levels with the help of an audiometer, but may also measure ability to discriminate between different sound intensities, recognize pitch, or distinguish speech from background noise. Acoustic reflex and otoacoustic emissions may also be measured. Results of audiometric tests are used to diagnose hearing loss or diseases of the ear, and often make use of an audiogram. History The basic requirements of the field were to be able to produce a repeating sound, some way to attenuate the amplitude, a way to transmit the sound to the subject, and a means to record and interpret the subject's responses to the test. =Mechanical \\"acuity meters\\" and tuning forks= For many years there were a desultory use of various devices capable of producing sounds of controlled intensity. The first types were clock-like, giving off air-borne sound to the tubes of a stethoscope; the sound distributor head had a valve which could be gradually closed. Another model used a tripped hammer to strike a metal rod and produce the testing sound; in another a tuning fork was struck. The first such measurement device for testing hearing was described by Wolke (1802). =Pure tone audiometry and audiograms= Following development of the induction coil in 1849 and audio transducers (telephone) in 1876, a variety of audiometers were invented in United States and overseas. These early audiometers were known as induction-coil audiometers due to... *Hughes 1879 *Hartmann 1878 In 1885, Arthur Hartmann designed an ‚ÄúAuditory Chart‚Äù which included left and right ear tuning fork representation on the x -axis and percent of hearing on the y-axis. In 1899, Carl E. Seashore Prof. of Psychology at U. Iowa, United States, introduced the audiometer as an instrument to measure the ‚Äúkeenness of hearing‚Äù whether in the laboratory, schoolroom, or office of the psychologist or aurist. The instrument operated on a battery and presented a tone or a click; it had an attenuator set in a scale of 40 steps. His machine became the basis of the audiometers later manufactured at Western Electric. *Cordia C.

Schwarzkopf ‚Äî demonstrated before the Berlin Oto-logical Society two instruments designed to test hearing acuity. Both were built with vacuum tubes. Their designs were characteristic of the two basic types of electronic circuits used in most electronic audio devices for the next two decades. Neither of the two devices was developed commercially for some time, although the second was to be manufactured under the name \\"Otaudion.\\" The Western Electric 1A, developed by was built in 1922 in the United States. It was not until 1922 that otolaryngologist Dr. Edmund P. Fowler, and physicists Dr. Harvey Fletcher and Robert Wegel of Western Electric Co. first employed frequency at octave intervals plotted along the x axis and intensity downward along the y-axis as a degree of hearing loss. Fletcher et al. also coined the term ‚Äúaudiogram‚Äù at that time. With further technologic advances, bone conduction testing capabilities became a standard component of all Western Electric audiometers by 1928. =Electrophysiologic audiometry= In 1967, Sohmer and Feinmesser were the first to publish auditory brainstem responses (ABR), recorded with surface electrodes in humans which showed that cochlear potentials could be obtained non-invasively. =Otoacoustic audiometry= In 1978, David Kemp reported that sound energy produced by the ear could be detected in the ear canal‚Äîotoacoustic emissions. The first commercial system for detecting and measuring otoacoustic emissions was produced in 1988. Auditory system =Components= The auditory system is composed of epithelial, osseous, vascular, neural and neocortical tissues. The anatomical divisions are external ear canal and tympanic membrane, middle ear, inner ear, VIII auditory nerve, and central auditory processing portions of the neocortex. =Hearing process= Sound waves enter the outer ear and travel through the external auditory canal until they reach the tympanic membrane, causing the membrane and the attached chain of auditory ossicles to vibrate. The motion of the stapes against the oval window sets up waves in the fluids of the cochlea, causing the basilar membrane to vibrate. This stimulates the sensory cells of the organ of Corti, atop the basilar membrane, to send nerve impulses to the central auditory processing areas of the brain, the auditory cortex, where sound is perceived and interpreted. Sensory and psychodynamics of human hearing =Cocktail party effect= =Understanding speech= =Non-linearity= =Temporal synchronization ‚Äì sound localization and echo location= Parameters of human hearing =Frequency range= =Amplitude sensitivity= Audiometric testing *objectives: integrity, structure, function, freedom from infirmity. =Normative standards= *ISO 7029:2000 and BS 6951 Types of audiometry =Subjective audiometry= Subjective audiometry requires the cooperation of the subject, and relies upon subjective responses which may both qualitative and quantitative, and involve attention (focus), reaction time, etc. * Differential testing is conducted with a low frequency (usually 512 Hz) tuning fork. They are used to assess asymmetrical hearing and air/bone conduction differences. They are simple manual physical tests and do not result in an audiogram. ** Weber test ** Bing test ** Rinne test ** Schwabach test, a variant of the Rinne test * Pure tone audiometry is a standardized hearing test in which air conduction hearing thresholds in decibels (db) for a set of fixed frequencies between 250 Hz and 8,000 Hz are plotted on an audiogram for each ear independently. A separate set of measurements is made for bone conduction. There is also high frequency Pure Tone Audiometry covering the frequency range above 8000 Hz to 16,000 Hz. *Threshold equalizing noise (TEN) test *Masking level difference (MLD) test *Psychoacoustic (or psychophysical) tuning curve test * Speech audiometry is a diagnostic hearing test designed to test word or speech recognition. It has become a fundamental tool in hearing-loss assessment. In conjunction with pure-tone audiometry, it can aid in determining the degree and type of hearing loss. Speech audiometry also provides information regarding discomfort or tolerance to speech stimuli and information on word recognition abilities. In addition, information gained by speech audiometry can help determine proper gain and maximum output of hearing aids and other amplifying devices for patients with significant hearing losses and help assess how well they hear in noise. Speech audiometry also facilitates audiological rehabilitation management. Speech audiometry may include: **Speech awareness threshold **Speech recognition threshold **Suprathreshold word-recognition **Sentence testing **Dichotic listening test **Loudness levels determination * B√©k√©sy audiometry, also called decay audiometry - audiometry in which the subject controls increases and decreases in intensity as the frequency of the stimulus is gradually changed so that the subject traces back and forth across the threshold of hearing over the frequency range of the test. The test is quick and reliable, so was frequently used in military and industrial contexts. *Audiometry of children **Conditioned play audiometry **Behavioral observation audiometry **Visual reinforcement audiometry =Objective audiometry= Objective audiometry is based on physical, acoustic or electrophysiologic measurements and does not depend on the cooperation or subjective responses of the subject. *Caloric stimulation/reflex test uses temperature difference between hot and cold water or air delivered into the ear to test for neural damage. Caloric stimulation of the ear results in rapid side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus. Absence of nystagmus may indicate auditory nerve damage. This test will often be done as part of another test called electronystagmography. *Electronystagmography (ENG) uses skin electrodes and an electronic recording device to measure nystagmus evoked by procedures such as caloric stimulation of the ear * Acoustic immittance audiometry - Immittance audiometry is an objective technique which evaluates middle ear function by three procedures: static immittance, tympanometry, and the measurement of acoustic reflex threshold sensitivity. Immittance audiometry is superior to pure tone audiometry in detecting middle ear pathology. ** Tympanometry ** Acoustic reflex thresholds ** Acoustic reflectometry ** wide- band absorbance audiometry also called 3D tympanometry * Evoked potential audiometry ** N1-P2 cortical audio evoked potential (CAEP) audiometry ** ABR is a neurologic tests of auditory brainstem function in response to auditory (click) stimuli. ** Electrocochleography a variant of ABR, tests the impulse transmission function of the cochlea in response to auditory (click) stimuli. It is most often used to detect endolymphatic hydrops in the diagnois/assessment of Meniere's disease. ** Audio steady state response (ASSR) audiometry ** Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) test, a variant of ABR that tests the integrity of the saccule * Otoacoustic emission audiometry - this test can differentiate between the sensory and neural components of sensorineural hearing loss. ** Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) audiometry ** Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) audiometry ** Sustained frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAE) audionetry - At present, SFOAEs are not used clinically. * In situ audiometry: a technique for measuring not only the affliction of the person's auditory system, but also the characteristics of sound reproduction devices, in-the-canal hearing aids, vents and sound tubes of hearing aids.Vashekevich M.I., Azarov I.S., Petrovskiy A.A., Cosine-modulated filter banks with a phase conversion: realization and use in hearing aids. - Moscow, Goryachaya liniya-Telecom, 2014. -210 p.‚Üë Vonlanthen A. Hearing Aids / Vonlanthen A. Horst A. - Rostov- on-Don: Phoenix, 2009. -304 p. Audiograms The result of most audiometry is an audiogram plotting some measured dimension of hearing, either graphically or tabularly. The most common type of audiogram is the result of a pure tone audiometry hearing test which plots frequency versus amplitude sensitivity thresholds for each ear along with bone conduction thresholds at 8 standard frequencies from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz. A pure tone audiometry hearing test is the gold standard for evaluation of hearing loss/disability. Other types of hearing tests also generate graphs or tables of results that may be loosely called 'audiograms', but the term is universally used to refer to the result of a pure tone audiometry hearing test. Hearing assessment Apart from testing hearing, part of the function of audiometry is in assessing or evaluating hearing from the test results. The most commonly used assessment of hearing is the determination of the threshold of audibility, i.e. the level of sound required to be just audible. This level can vary for an individual over a range of up to 5 decibels from day to day and from determination to determination, but it provides an additional and useful tool in monitoring the potential ill effects of exposure to noise. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral, and bilateral hearing loss may not be symmetrical. The most common types of hearing loss, due to age and noise exposure, are usually bilateral and symmetrical. In addition to the traditional audiometry, hearing assessment can be performed using a standard set of frequencies (audiogram) with mobile applications to detect possible hearing impairments. =Hearing loss classification= The primary focus of audiometry is assessment of hearing status and hearing loss, including extent, type and configuration. *There are four defined degrees of hearing loss: mild, moderate, severe and profound. *Hearing loss may be divided into four types: conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, central auditory processing disorders, and mixed types. *Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral, of sudden onset or progressive, and temporary or permanent. Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors including heredity, congenital conditions, age-related (presbycusis) and acquired factors like noise-induced hearing loss, ototoxic chemicals and drugs, infections, and physical trauma. Clinical practice Audiometric testing may be performed by a general practitioner medical doctor, an otolaryngologist (a specialized MD also called an ENT), a CCC-A (Certificate of Clinical Competence in Audiology) audiologist, a certified school audiometrist (a practitioner analogous to an optometrist who tests eyes), and sometimes other trained practitioners. Practitioners are certified by American Board of Audiology (ABA).

It has a moderate amount of heat, with winters not cold enough to sustain snow cover. Summers are warm within oceanic climate regimes, and hot within continental climate regimes. Origin of term The term is derived from two Greek words meaning \\"having a moderate amount of heat.\\" This can be misinterpreted, however, since the term is actually intended to describe only the temperature conditions that prevail during the winter months, rather than those for the year as a whole. Definition Under the broadest definition, all places with an average temperature in their coldest month that is colder than 18 ¬∞C, but warmer than ‚àí3 ¬∞C, are said to have a mesothermal climate. In some climate classification schemes, however, this is divided into two segments, with a coldest-month average of 6 ¬∞C being the line of demarcation between them; then only those locations with a coldest-month temperature of between ‚àí3 ¬∞C and 6 ¬∞C are reckoned as mesothermal, the label \\"subtropical\\" being applied to areas where the average temperature in the coldest month ranges from 6 ¬∞C to 18 ¬∞C. Observing the narrower definition articulated above, the mesothermal locations are those where the winters are too cold to allow year-round photosynthesis, but not cold enough to support a fixed period of continuous snow cover every year. Range In the US, the northern boundary line between mesothermal and microthermal ranges is north of Juneau and Sitka at the Pacific Ocean. It goes sharply south to about 38N latitude in the Rockies, then eastward across the lower Midwest to the East Coast near Boston. The southern boundary line between mesothermal and megathermal (or tropical) is across south Florida just above Palm Beach. Summer Summers in these places may be hot (that is to say, having an average temperature in their warmest month of 22 ¬∞C or above) or merely warm (with the warmest month averaging between 10 ¬∞C and 22 ¬∞C). The hot-summer, or continental, mesothermal climate is encountered exclusively in the Northern Hemisphere, in the landmass interiors of Asia and North America and along their east coasts, while the most frequently seen example of a warm to cool-summer mesothermal climate is the oceanic climates found along the west coasts of all of the world's continents, roughly equidistant between the geographical tropical and polar zones. List of mesothermal cities and their summer temperatures: Hong Kong-hot summer Milan-hot summer New York City-hot summer Tokyo-hot summer London-warm summer Mexico City-warm summer Vancouver-warm summer Moisture In addition to being subdivisible by summer temperature, mesothermal climates can also be subclassified on the basis of precipitation -- into humid, semiarid and arid subtypes within your front door within depth See also *Megathermal *Microthermal References Applied Climatology, John Griffiths (for use of 6 ¬∞C in the coldest month as poleward limit of subtropical climates) Climate and weather classification systems ","title":"Mesothermal"},{"id":"1374347","text":"The Australian Constitution places some restraints on the ability of the State and Federal governments to freely cooperate.

The soundtrack was composed by Mark Oliver Everett of the band Eels. Levity was filmed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Plot  Manual Jordan, a man who served nearly 23 years for killing a teenager during an attempted robbery, is released on parole in spite of his objections. After spending his time staring at a clipping of Abner Easley, the boy he killed, he returns to the city he used to live in to find redemption. He ends up living at a community house which is run by Miles Evans, a preacher. He offers Manual work so he can pay for the room, and Manual places Abner's photo in his room to remind himself of his crime. While staying at the community house, he befriends Sofia Mellinger, a wild young woman with no adult figure in her life. Manual also encounters Adele Easley, the elder sister of Abner. She does not recognize Manual and in his pursuit for forgiveness, he forms a friendship with her, and their relationship begins to develop.

Widely recognized for his defining vision of an intercultural and interdisciplinary mode of movement-based performance, Shen Wei creates original works that employ an assortment of media elements, including dance, painting, sound, sculpture, theater and video. Frequently, critics have commented on his innovative blend of Asian and Western sensibilities, as well as his syncretic approach to performance art. In 2000, he founded Shen Wei Dance Arts and became the artistic director of the contemporary dance company. The works he has created for the company is based on his own dance technique created over the past 12 years, a movement language he calls \\"natural body development\\". In recent years, Shen Wei has expanded his artistry to include large-scale multimedia works showcasing original art installations, and original video and animation material. Shen Wei's 13 major movement-based works has toured in 30 countries in 130 cities. Shen Wei has been commissioned by the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, the Park Avenue Armory, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Lincoln Center Festival in New York City, and the TeatroDell'Opera di Roma, as well as contemporary ballet companies such as Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal. For each new work he choreographs, Shen Wei typically designs all the visual elements including the sets, costumes and make-up, film projection and lighting as well. In addition to creating works for the proscenium, Shen Wei has also created works for fashion shows, art exhibition openings, and other cultural productions for international companies. In July 2008, he choreographed a fashion show at Paris Haute Couture for the label WUYONG, by the Chinese designer Ma Ke. In 2004, Shen Wei received the Nijinsky Award for Emerging Choreographer and, in 2007, he received the MacArthur Award. China (1968‚Äì1994) early education and influences =Family background and education in the arts= Shen (family name) Wei (give name) was born in 1968 in Hunan, China to an artist family during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. His father is a Chinese opera director, performer and calligrapher, and his mother is a theater producer. Both of Shen Wei's brothers are visual artists. Shen Wei left home at the age of nine to study classical Chinese Opera at The Hunan Arts School (now: Hunan Vocational College of the Arts) for more than 6 years (1978‚Äì1984). His training included voice, dance and theater performance. At the same time he also self-taught Chinese Traditional Painting and calligraphy. From 1984 to 1989 Shen Wei was a member of the Hunan State Xian Opera Company, performing leading roles in the company. Following China's reestablishment of diplomatic and economic ties to the West in the early 1980s, Shen Wei began to study western classic oil painting techniques and styles of artists such as Michelangelo, da Vinci, Rembrandt, C√©zanne, Modigliani, Francis Bacon and Lucian Michael Freud. In 1989 he discovered a passion for modern dance and moved to Guangzhou to study at China's first modern dance education institution, the Guangzhou Modern Dance Academy. During his two years at the academy he was taught by master teachers such as Ross Parks and David Hochoy from the Martha Graham Dance Company, Betty Jones and Fritz Ludin from the Jose Limon Dance Company, Claudia Gitelman from Alwin Nikolais Dance Company, and Liz Walton from the Paul Taylor Dance Company. The program was jointly supported by the American Dance Festival and the Asian Cultural Council. In 1991, Shen Wei became one of the founding members of the China's first modern dance company, the Guangdong Modern Dance Company, choreographing and dancing with the company until 1994. =Early creations= Shen Wei's early work is influenced by multiple disciplines within traditional Chinese and Western art. During the early 1990s he created 10 dance works for the Guangdong Modern Dance Company and many oil paintings. \\"Still Child\\", \\"Racing With The Sun\\", \\"Colored Relations\\" and \\"Insomnia\\" became part of the repertory of the company during this time. Additionally, he is the one of China's first underground experimental performing artists. In 1994 he created his one-man, experimental multi-media show \\"Small Room\\", which toured in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Hong Kong, and which catapulted him into the public eye. In 1994 he was awarded the First Prize in both Choreography and Performance at the National Modern Dance Competition in China. New York City (1995‚Äìpresent) =Early New York life and work (1995‚Äì1999)= After receiving a three-month scholarship from the Nikolais/Louis Dance Lab, Shen Wei moved to New York City on Jan 15, 1995 and began his 5 years of artistic experimentation in New York City. During this time he expanded his artistic knowledge, studying artists such as Andrei Tarkovsky, Federico Fellini, Mark Rothko, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Igor Stravinsky, and Steve Reich. In dance, he explored release techniques from which he began to develop his own movement language. Shen Wei also performed for Murray Louis and was part of four of Martha Clarke's productions. Additionally, he began creating works for the American Dance Festival and Alvin Ailey II. In 1997, Cloud Gate Dance Theater toured his revised version of \\"The Bed\\" commissioned by American Dance Festival in 1995. He also toured his one-man show \\"Small Room\\" at The Palace Theater in London, The Asia Society in NYC and Hollins College in VA. =Dance and visual work in conjunction with minimalism and surrealism (1999‚Äì2001)= After 5 years of living in New York, Shen Wei began to develop a style of movement that has been described as \\"enigmatic\\" and \\"dream-like\\", and which is exemplified by \\"Folding\\" (2000), \\"Near The Terrace, Part I & II\\" (2000‚Äì2001) \\"Behind Resonance\\" (2001). According to Anna Kisselgoff, in these early pieces, the surrealist aesthetic emerges as a result of a disruption in what Shen Wei calls, \\"natural elements,\\" such as regular breathing cycles, which affects the quality of movement in dancers. Folding and Near the Terrace have also been described as \\"kinetic tableus,\\"; the entire dance space characterized by swathes of color and sculptural movement. In 2000 after his premiere of \\"Near The Terrace\\" at the American Dance Festival (19) he formed his New York-based company, Shen Wei Dance Arts, which went on to tour at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the Switzerland Steps Festival in 2002. =Use of abstraction in choreography, music, and visual arts (2003‚Äì2005)= In 2003, Shen Wei reinterpreted Stravinsky's \\"Rite Of Spring\\", creating a piece that is accompanied by Fazil Say's fourhanded piano version of the Stravinsky's score. Divorcing itself from any narrative element, the \\"stripped-to-the-bone abstraction\\" places emphasis on the structural power in the music, dance and visual setting. The piece had its New York debut at the Lincoln Center Festival in 2003. Shen Wei and his company also made their Australian debut at the 2005 Sydney Festival with Folding and Rite of Spring at the Sydney Opera House. Shen Wei's \\"Connect Transfer\\" uses music by Iannis Xenakis, Kevin Volans and Gyorgy Ligeti. The work explores \\"internal and external body movements, as well as energy transitions,\\" and is a synthesis of music, dance, painting, and sculpture. \\"Map\\" is a musically inspired piece created with Steve Reich's, The Desert Music, and is accompanied with visual designs from Shen Wei's rehearsal sketches of choreographic and music arrangement structures. The work investigates new ways of moving and has a basis in Shen Wei's Natural Body Development technique. =Abstraction in painting= Shen Wei's study of abstract expressionism is also evident in his visual artworks. Chris Mao, in Movements, writes, \\"Not concerned with visual impact, [Shen Wei] focused on the energy of his movements, using different kinds of brushes to convey different kinds of movements.\\" \\"Energies\\" and \\"flows\\" are explored on canvas as a response to auditory stimulus. This particular kind of abstraction, according to Kisselgoff, is to be distinguished from American action painting, since it does not utilize the abstract expressionist techniques of dripping or throwing paint onto canvas. Solo exhibitions of Shen Wei's movement paintings took place in 2005 and 2007. Re-discovering the East through personal travel (2005‚Äì2009) Between 2005 and 2009 Shen Wei embarked on a personal journey, spending time in China (2004), Cambodia, (2005), Tibet (2005, 2006), and on China's Silk Road (2007). In 2007, he returned to Beijing in order to help direct and choreograph the 2008 Olympic Opening Ceremonies. In the midst of this period of travel, Shen Wei produced Second Visit of the Empress, a hybrid creation that overtly fuses traditional Chinese Opera and Theater with western modern dance. This large- scale production, which is a reinvention of a traditional Chinese opera narrative, consists of four Chinese Opera Singers, sixteen Chinese Musician and fourteen American contemporary dancers. The opera melds polarities, placing narrative and abstractive, traditional and contemporary, as well as Eastern and Western expressions within a single performance space. Re-Triptych is a meditation of Shen Wei's travels in three parts. Re-I is inspired by spirituality in Tibet; Re-II is inspired by the history of Angkor Wat in Cambodia; and Re-III explores the imagery of the Silk Road and the mutual influencing of different cultures. The three works are based on cultural investigations‚Äîdiscovering different kinds of human lifestyles and social interactions. The piece integrates original movement with recordings of traditional folk music, multimedia imagery, and installation. Re-Triptych took over three years to complete (2006‚Äì2009). Shen Wei is the director and choreographer of the opening segment \\"Scroll\\" at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Ceremony, which references his 2004 work \\"Connect Transfer\\". He was also a lead creative consultant for the planning of the Opening Ceremony. Multimedia, site-specific, installation performances (2010‚Äì2012) Exhibition and Performance with Installations at Mana Contemporary in Jersey City 2012 Shen Wei's more recent works step outside the boundaries of conventional concert dance. Since 2010, he has increasingly implemented other media forms in his work, a decision which represents Shen Wei's impression of today's technology saturated society as well as what art in future may look like. His work for Ballet Monte-Carlo, \\"7 to 8 and,\\" the ADF commissioned \\"Limited States,\\" and \\"The New You\\" produced by the Meadows Prize Project utilize film and live projections, sound installations, still life painting in addition to his own movement language. \\"The New You\\" also contains a theater component with a script written by Shen Wei. Site-specificity has also been prevalent in Shen Wei's work since 2010. In October 2010, his company presented a series of public performances in various locations throughout New York City. The vignettes consisted of excerpts from Re-(III), each of which were adapted for the specific urban space, which included Times Square, Wall Street, Union Square, a New York City Subway station under 42nd Street, and many others. Prior to this, Shen Wei created a site-specific response piece to Ernesto Neto's installation, Anthropodino, at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. Dancers and audience members moved within the collective space of Neto's immersive sculpture. In June 2011, Shen Wei Dance Arts performed Still Moving in the American Wing of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Commissioned by the Museum, Still Moving is, according to Shen Wei, about \\"creating a dialogue between the dancers and the gallery's sculptures, between past and present, between immobility and movement.\\" The piece consists of three parts, Restaging: Near the Terrace, Transition, and Internal External #1, all contained within the Charles Englehard Court. It is the first site-specific performance in the history of the Metropolitan Museum. On November 29, 2011, Shen Wei Dance Arts premiered \\"Undivided Divided\\", its largest production to date. Commissioned by the Park Avenue Armory, the immersive, site-specific piece reconfigures traditional performer-audience relations so that audience members move and survey dance within the multimedia performance space. Amidst the performers and enveloped by sound and projections, audience members, in a sense, become part of the performance. The performance of Undivided Divided at Park Avenue Armory had over 30 dancers. It will be presented, as part of the company's rep, in museums and galleries. =New Commissions, Untitled No. 12, & Untitled Painting Series (2013-2016)= In the summer of 2013, Shen Wei directed and choreographed a staging of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana. Created for and commissioned by Teatro di San Carlo in Naples, Italy, the production featured an orchestra of 100, a 100-member chorus, and 47 dancers. Critics from Arte e Arte and Teatro & Spettacolo hailed the work as an admirable synthesis of disparate cultural and media elements. Shen Wei was also commissioned to choreograph a new work for the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring premiere. The work, titled Sacre du Printemps, premiered on June 15, 2013. In June 2014, Shen Wei exhibited part of a new series of paintings, Untitled, at the Crow Collection of Asian Art in Dallas. A full exhibition of the new painting series opened at Miami Dade College Museum of Art + Design in December during the Art Basel festival and was accompanied by Shen Wei Dance Arts site-specific performances of Untitled No. 12 - 1. Both the exhibition and the performance event received extensive media coverage as one of the must-sees of the festival. This new series of paintings or tasveer consists of 11 large-scale works. In the fall of 2015, two small selections of these paintings traveled to The Tucson Museum of Art, Arizona and at The Fine Art Society in London for separate exhibitions - \\"Shen Wei In Black, White, and Gray\\" and as part of a group show \\"Performance and Remnant\\" respectively. In the spring of 2016, \\"Shen Wei: Dance Strokes\\" was exhibited at Asia Society Hong Kong Centre during Hong Kong Art Basel. Inspired by Miami's 2014 exhibition, seven works were shown, six of which were shown at MDC Museum of Art + Design, and one of which was a new work completed in 2015. This exhibition was also accompanied by Shen Wei Dance Arts' Untitled No. 12 - 1, as well as a site-specific performance Untitled No.32 (Bodies and Rooftop, 2016), which took place on the Joseph Lau and Josephine Lau Roof Garden. Despite not being able to exhibit a larger breadth of work, both painting exhibition and performances were well received by an international audience, especially since being reintroduced to the art world in Asia as a painter and a choreographer. This exhibition allowed viewers to see Shen Wei's work in both mediums, and draw connections between his acute sensibilities. For those who had seen his earlier work, the Movements series, debuted in Hong Kong ten years prior, an obvious development can be depicted through his technique and approach. Shen Wei's latest work for the proscenium, Untitled No. 12 - 2, commissioned by American Dance Festival, Spoleto Festival USA, and Brooklyn Academy of Arts, draws inspiration from the paintings and Untitled No. 12 - 1. The work utilizes projections and a metronome sound scape designed by Shen Wei and played live by the dancers. Philosophy Shen Wei in 2011 Shen Wei considers himself an artist that is fascinated with the human body. In an interview with Zinta Lundborg of Bloomberg (2011), Shen Wei stated, \\"Dancers should show expression through their body movement. They're not actors.\\" His \\"Natural Body Development\\" technique takes a holistic approach to dance, integrating breath-work with proprioception, visual focus, weight, and gravity. For Shen Wei, movement can be initiated by chi or breath. This idea is further guided by his philosophies of internal and external energies and how the two are mutually affecting, constantly generating and generated by the physical body. As such, Shen Wei argues against dualist philosophies, believing dancers should \\"develop their minds as much as their bodies.\\" He states, \\"I don't use dancers to copy some movement ‚Äì human beings are not just puppets. A dancer has to have a really open mind, and be willing to take a risk.\\" In his choreographic process, Shen Wei also employs structured improvisation, allowing dancers to use their intuitions to create novel movement assemblages. His seminal work, Rite of Spring, contains a series of carefully guided improvisations that result in a \\"set structure with a balance between movement exactitude and movement intuition.\\" Shen Wei has stated that his number one goal when making art is \\"inspire other human beings\\". He has proclaimed, \\"When you're an artist and you're creating new works you have to have passion because you want to make it the best that you can. You want to make it as clear as you can and you want to do things you've never done before. You want to make things that have never existed before, you want to make new things; you don't want to repeat yourself. At the same time you want people to feel these things are new, make them communicate, become part of the culture and to inspire other human beings ‚Äì this is my number one goal when I make new work. That's the pressure.\\" Select works Folding (2000) * World Premiere: Guangdong Modern Dance Company * Concept, Choreography, Costumes, Set and Make-up Design: Shen Wei * Music: John Tavener and Tibetan Buddhist Chant * Lighting: David Ferri Near the Terrace-Part I (2001) * World Premiere: American Dance Festival * Concept, Choreography, Set and Costume Design: Shen Wei * Music: Arvo P√§rt * Lighting: David Ferri Behind Resonance (2001) * World Premiere: SUNY Purchase * Choreography, Set and Costume Design: Shen Wei * Music: David Lang * Lighting: David Ferri and Shen Wei Near the Terrace-Part II (2002) * World Premiere: American Dance Festival * Concept, Choreography, Set and Costume Design: Shen Wei * Music: Arvo P√§rt, Benjamin Iobst, music of Mangkun√™garan * Lighting: David Ferri Rite of Spring (2003) * Concept, Choreography, Costumes, Set and Make-up Design: Shen Wei * Score: Igor Stravinsky * Musical Recording: Fazil Say * Lighting: David Ferri Exhibition- Solo Painting Exhibition (2003) * A series of Paintings created in conjunction with his abstracted Rite of Spring were first exhibited as part of the company's New York City debut at the Lincoln Center Festival in 2003 Connect Transfer (2004) * World Premiere: American Dance Festival * Concept, Choreography, Set, and Costume Design: Shen Wei * Music: Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Kevin Volans, Iannis Xenakis * Lighting: Jennifer Tipton Map (2005) * World Premiere: Lincoln Center Festival * Concept, Choreography, Costumes, Set Design: Shen Wei * Music: Steve Reich * Lighting: David Scott Bolman The Second Visit To the Empress (2005, 2007) * World Premiere: American Dance Festival 2005 * Direction, Choreography, Set, Make-up and Costume Design: Shen Wei * Music: Traditional Chinese Beijing Opera * Lighting: Jennifer Tipton Exhibition-Solo Painting Exhibition - Movements (2005) * Hong Kong New Vision Arts Festival with Chambers Fine Arts in New York 2005 Re-Part I (2006) * Concept, Choreography, Set and Costume Design: Shen Wei * Music: Traditional Tibetan Chant * Vocals: Ani Choying Dolma * Lighting: Jennifer Tipton Re-Part II (2007) * Concept, Choreography, Set and Costume Design; and Sounds and Images recorded at Angkor Wat: Shen Wei * Music: John Tavener's \\"Tears of the Angels,\\" with Traditional Cambodian Music, and Original recordings by Shen Wei * Lighting: Jennifer Tipton * Projection Design: Shen Wei & Daniel Hartnett Exhibition-Solo Painting Exhibition - Movements (2007) * Chambers Fine Arts in New York 2007 Fashion Show at Paris Haute Couture-WUYONG, by the Chinese designer Ma Ke (2007) * Direction, Choreography and Co-installation design for 40 performing artists at the Palais Royale in Paris: Shen Wei The Beijing Olympic Opening Ceremony \\"Scroll\\" Segment 2008 * Direction and Choreography: Shen Wei * Original Score: Chen Qi-Gung * General Director of the Opening Ceremony: Zhang Yimou Re-Part III (2009) * Concept, Choreography, Set and Costume Design; and Sounds and Images recorded on China's Silk Road: Shen Wei * Original Score: David Lang * Recorded Violinist: Todd Reynolds * Lighting: Jennifer Tipton * Projection Design: Shen Wei and Daniel Hartnett 7 to 8 and (2010) * World Premiere: Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo * Choreography and visual and projection design: Shen Wei * Original Score: Dirk Haubrich NYC Guerilla- Site Specific Work (2010) * Sites: Times Square, Wall Street, Union Square, 42nd Street, outside of New York Public Library Main Branch, outside of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Columbia University, and Battery Park * Concept and Choreography: Shen Wei * Performed by: Shen Wei Dance Arts Still Moving (2011) * World Premiere: Metropolitan Museum of Art * Concept, Choreography, and Visual Design: Shen Wei * Original Score: Daniel Burke * Costume: Shen Wei and Austin Scarlett Limited States (2011) * World Premiere: American Dance Festival * Concept, Choreography, Video and Animation Design: Shen Wei * Original Score: Daniel Burke * Lighting: Shen Wei and Matthew F.

He performed in drag and also as himself in theatrical productions, television shows and film. Early life Born as Daniel Patrick Carroll in Cork City,Irish Times obituary Ireland, in 1927, La Rue was the youngest of five siblings. The family moved to England when he was six and he was brought up at Earnshaw Street in Soho, central London. When the family home was destroyed during the Blitz, his mother, a seamstress, moved her children to Kennford, a Devon village where young Daniel developed an interest in dramatics. \\"There weren't enough girls so I got the pick of the roles ... My Juliet was very convincing\\", La Rue recalled.Daily Telegraph obituary He served in the Royal Navy as a young man following in his father's footsteps, and for a time worked delivering groceries. He became known as a female impersonator, or \\"comic in a frock\\" as he preferred to be called it, in the United Kingdom and was featured in theatre productions, and in film, television and records. Career Among his celebrity impersonations were Elizabeth Taylor, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Judy Garland, Margot Fonteyn, Marlene Dietrich and Margaret Thatcher. At one point he had his own nightclub in Hanover Square, and also performed on London's West End. In the 1960s he was among Britain's highest-paid entertainers. In the 1970s, he owned the Swan, a noted inn at Streatley on the River Thames. In 1982 he played Dolly Levi in the musical Hello, Dolly!. He also has the distinction of being the only man to take over a woman's role in the West End theatre when he replaced Avis Bunnage in Oh, What a Lovely War! and he was until his death still a regular performer in traditional Christmas pantomime shows in Britain. In 1968 his version of \\"On Mother Kelly's Doorstep\\" reached number 33 in the UK singles chart; La Rue later adopted the song as his theme tune. He had a starring role in the film Our Miss Fred in 1972, and also appeared in Every Day's a Holiday, The Frankie Howerd Show, Twiggs, Decidedly Dusty, Entertainment Express, Blackpool Bonanza and the BBC's Play of the Month in a production of Charley's Aunt (1969). He made a guest appearance as himself in the Mr. Bean episode \\"Mr. Bean in Room 426\\" in 1993. La Rue's final major public appearance was in Hello Danny, a biographical show performed at the \\"Benidorm Palace\\", which opened on 11 November 2007. The part of the young La Rue was played by Jerry Lane, who also co-created and directed. La Rue appeared at the start of the show and then in an interview on stage in part of the second half. He also performed a number of songs. Illness and death La Rue suffered a mild stroke in January 2006 while in Spain on holiday: as a result, his final pantomime and all subsequent performances were cancelled. He had been suffering from prostate cancer for many years, a fact not publicised to his fans. He had several further strokes and developed throat cancer. He died shortly before midnight on 31 May 2009 at the age of 81. His friend & costume designer, Annie Galbraith, was with him (he was living at her home in Tunbridge Wells) when he died. La Rue was laid to rest with his partner, Jack Hanson, in St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, west London. Personal life La Rue would often perform parts of his show in men's clothes, and was often seen out of costume on television. In later life, he was more candid about his private life, including his homosexuality. La Rue lived for many years with his manager and life partner of 37 years, Jack Hanson, until Hanson's death in 1984.Daily Telegraph obituary, 1 June 2009 They had met after World War II in 1947.The Unforgettable Danny La Rue (2010), director Mark Turnbull. In 1970, La Rue bought The Swan inn at Streatley in Berkshire. He was later forced by circumstances to sell it. In the 1970s, La Rue spent more than ¬£1 million on the purchase and restoration of a country house hotel, Walton Hall, in Warwickshire, and signed it over in 1983, as he could not manage it and his career, to a pair of Canadian con men. La Rue had given control of the hotel to the two Canadians with a promise of further investment with the retention of La Rue's name on the hotel itself. This eventually led to a police investigation where La Rue was cleared of any suspicion but discovered he had lost more than ¬£1 million. The con men had bankrupted La Rue but he insisted in continuing to work to pay off the debts incurred rather than retire. Accolades He was appointed OBE in the 2002 Queen's Birthday Honours List. La Rue later stated in an interview that this was \\"the proudest day of his life\\". Other accolades included Royal Variety Performance appearances in 1969, 1972 and 1978, Variety Club of Great Britain Showbiz Personality of the Year (1969), Theatre Personality of the Year (1970), Entertainer of the Decade (1979) and the Brinsworth Award from the EABF for his outstanding contribution to the entertainment profession and the community.Lasting Tribute website In 1987, he was King Rat of the showbusiness charity the Grand Order of Water Rats.

It is located close to Gƒßarb and Gƒßasri and is built on two hilltop plateaus, Ta' Abram and Ix-Xagƒßra ta≈º-≈ªebbuƒ°. The fishing port and tourist resort of Marsalforn lies within the ≈ªebbuƒ° Council. The village has a population of 2,956 (as of March 2014), which makes it the fifth largest in Gozo, after Xewkija. With an area of 7.6 km2, ≈ªebbuƒ° is the largest local council in Gozo by land area. The word ≈ªebbuƒ° means \\"olive trees\\", a crop for which the village used to be noted, although nowadays very few olive trees remain on the slopes of ≈ªebbuƒ°. The village is also well known for its fine lacework and for its nearby coastal beauty spots. History The areas around ≈ªebbuƒ° have been inhabited for millennia. There are Bronze Age remains on Ta' Kuljat hill, and even older remains can be found to the north, close to Qbajjar Bay. Punic tombs were also found at Qbajjar. Over the following centuries, the area was then inhabited only by a few farmers. A community began to take shape in the 13th century, and eventually a small chapel was built. In 1643, plans were made to build a fortified city in Marsalforn, to serve as Gozo's capital instead of the ancient Cittadella, but the project was eventually abandoned due to a lack of funds. The parish of ≈ªebbuƒ°, which is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary (), was established on 28 April 1688 by bishop Davide Cocco Palmieri. The village's parish church is the oldest one in Gozo, apart from St George's basilica (1678) and the cathedral (1714) in Victoria. From 1715 onwards, a chain of fortifications were built along the ≈ªebbuƒ° coastline, especially at Marsalforn. Most of these have been destroyed over the years, with the only surviving vestige being Qolla l-Bajda Battery between Qbajjar and Xwejni Bays. In 1738, deposits of calcite travertine (referred to locally as alabaster, or, though it is related to neither, as 'onyx marble' on account of its banded appearance when cut) were discovered in a field known as Taƒã-ƒäaqra or Is-Sagƒßtrija. The travertine was used to decorate the interior of the parish church of ≈ªebbuƒ°, as well as in some other churches in Gozo and Malta.

It is notable in that it is one of the few venomous mammals. The specific epithet, brevicauda, is a combination of the Latin brevis and cauda, meaning \\"short tail\\".  Taxonomy  B. brevicauda is a red-toothed shrew, one of three or four species (depending on the authority) in the genus Blarina. It was formerly considered to be a sister subspecies of the southern short-tailed shrew (B. carolinensis). The species has been divided into 11 subspecies based on morphological characteristics, which are grouped into two semispecies: B. b. brevicauda and B. b. talpoides; these groupings were mirrored by a molecular systematics study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence. The two groups of subspecies are thought to have been kept isolated from each other by Pleistocene glaciers.  Description  Northern short-tailed shrew This shrew has a total length of , of which is tail; and weighs . The species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism in size, with the male being slightly larger than the female. The dorsal fur is thick and velvety, and can be black, brownish black, or silvery gray, with the ventral fur being a bit lighter and grayer. The shrew molts from a summer coat which is shorter and paler than the winter pelage in October and November, and back again sometime in February through July. The tail is quite short, amounting to less than 25% of the total length. The dental formula is I 3-3/1-1, C 1-1/1-1, P 3-3/1-1, M 3-3/3-3 = 16/16 = 32. Three well-developed scent glands are present, one on each side of the animal and one placed ventrally; the scent may be used for marking territories, though the shrew's sense of smell is thought to be poor.  Distribution  =Fossil record= Most records of B. brevicauda are from the Pleistocene, though one record from the late Pliocene (Blancan land mammal age) is tentatively attributed to this species. Another source indicates the earliest record of the genus Blarina is a specimen of B. b. talpoides, from the Blancan (early Pleistocene) in Kansas. The species is thought to have arisen in the middle or late Pliocene. The B. b. brevicauda subspecies appeared later. Includes a range map. =Range= This shrew is found throughout central and eastern North America, from southern Saskatchewan to Atlantic Canada and south to northern Arkansas and Georgia. It is probably the most common shrew in the Great Lakes region. Population densities usually range from five to 30 shrews per hectare (two to 12 per acre), but rarely exceed 200/ha (80/ac). The typical home range of a shrew is 2.5 ha, and may overlap slightly with the ranges of other shrews. =Habitat= Both disturbed and undisturbed habitats are used by the northern short-tailed shrew, including grasslands, old fields, fencerows, marshy areas, deciduous and coniferous forests, and household gardens, though the preferred habitats are those which are moist with leaf litter or thick plant cover. Burned-over forests are not quickly recolonized by B. brevicauda, and shrews quickly depart clear-cuts.  Diet  This shrew consumes up to three times its weight in food each day. It eats small quantities of subterranean fungi and seeds, though it is mostly carnivorous. It prefers insects, earthworms, voles, snails, and other shrews for the bulk of its diet, though salamanders and mice are also eaten. This shrew consumes vertebrates more often than other shrews do. The shrew mostly forages within a few hours after sunset, though it is also active during cloudy days. High evaporative water loss requires the shrew to have access to a source of water, though it does obtain water from its food, as well. The shrew often hoards food, especially in the fall and winter, or during a time of prey abundance; one study found it caches 87% of the prey it catches, while 9% is eaten immediately and 4% is left where it was killed. = Toxin = The saliva of the northern short-tailed shrew contains a kallikrein-like protease, used to paralyze and subdue its prey. The toxin is strong enough to kill small animals, up to sizes somewhat larger than the shrew itself, and results in painful bites to humans who attempt to handle the shrew. The venomous saliva is secreted from submaxillary glands, through a duct which opens at the base of the lower incisors, where the saliva flows along the groove formed by the two incisors, and into the prey. The toxin is very similar in structure to the one produced by the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) which independently developed its toxin from the same precursor protein.Aminetzach et al. 2009  Physiology  = Senses = Their sense of smell is thought to be poor, and their eyes are degenerated and vision is thought to be limited to the detection of light, but the shrew compensates by using echolocation and a fine sense of touch. = Energetics = Its ability to consume almost anything it can catch allows the northern short-tailed shrew to survive the cold winters of temperate regions. The thermoneutral zone of this species is from 25 to 33 ¬∞C, meaning no extra energy must be expended by the animal to maintain its body temperature (which averages 38.0‚Äì38.5 ¬∞C) when the ambient temperature is within this range. Food consumption is 43% higher in winter than in summer, as the shrew must increase its metabolic rate to maintain its body temperature under the cold conditions. Temperatures at or above 35 ¬∞C are lethal for this shrew. A study of captive shrews found, though they were primarily nocturnal, the degree of nocturnality changed with the season; that is, during the colder winter, the shrews exhibited more out-of-burrow activity earlier in the evening, but were active later in the night during the summer. This seasonal pattern was due to solar radiation and changing daily temperatures, and it allows the shrews to minimize the energy needed for thermoregulation. Other winter adaptations include the creation of a lined nest which aids the shrew in conserving heat, the caching of food in case of prey shortages, foraging below the leaf litter or snow where the temperature is milder, and decreasing activity levels during cold periods. Along with these behavioral adaptations, the northern short- tailed shrew increases its ability to generate body heat during the winter by nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue.  Behavior  Other shrews spend more time above ground than does the northern short-tailed shrew, which prefers to tunnel along below ground, through the leaf litter, or at the snow/ground interface. Bouts of frenzied activity, lasting around five minutes, are followed by longer periods of resting, with the total active time amounting to only 16% of a 24-hour day. This animal is capable of digging at a rate of 2.5 cm/min, in between resting. The shrew constructs a nest up to in diameter underground or underneath a log, and lines it with leaves or the fur of the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). This nest is kept clean, with wastes deposited outside the nest in a latrine area. Other parts of the burrow system are used for food storage. Typically solitary, B. brevicauda exhibits several aggressive displays and vocalizations to ward off other members of the species when encounters occur. Pairs of shrews which were introduced to a cage simultaneously coexisted for less than four months before one killed the other, and a new shrew placed in a cage containing an already established shrew will be killed within a few hours.  Reproduction  Mating occurs from March through September, though most births occur early or late in that period. Male shrews in captivity were observed to make clicking sounds while courting a female. During copulation, the male and female are locked together, and the female drags the male along with her. Gestation lasts 21‚Äì24 days, and after birth, the six to eight young are suckled for up to 25 days before the babies are weaned. Two litters per season are typical, though three are possible. The female strengthens the nest when the young are nursing, and is more active to support her increased nutritional needs. The young, which were born hairless and blind and weighing less than a gram, may become sexually mature in as soon as 2‚Äì3 months; those born in the spring mature more quickly than those born late in the season, and may themselves reproduce in the same year they were born. The juvenile pelage is pale and quite similar to the adults' summer fur, and is molted when the young reaches adult size.  Predation  The northern short-tailed shrew has a high mortality rate, though it attempts to escape predation by remaining hidden under vegetation, soil, leaf litter, or snow; only 6% of a marked group of shrews survived to the next year, and winter mortality of 90% has been recorded, probably due to cold stress. This shrew is consumed by many predators: trout, snakes, raptors, canids, cats, mustelids, skunks, raccoons, and opossums, though mammalian carnivores appear to be deterred by the musky odor produced by the shrew's scent glands.  Conservation  The northern short-tailed shrew is considered a species of least concern in the IUCN Red List, as it is widespread, abundant, and its population is not declining.  Relationship with humans  Northern short-tailed shrews can not be domesticated.https://carnegiemnh.org/the-naming-of-the-shrew/ References * Aminetzach, Yael T.; Srouji, John R.; Kong, Chung Yin & Hoekstra, Hopi E.

He died in a plane accident with Gardel when he was at the height of his career. Biography Le Pera was born in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, the son of Italian immigrants who moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1902. At the beginning of his career, he worked for several Argentinian periodicals as a journalist and theatre critic and in 1928 became involved in the film industry. He worked for Paramount Pictures while living in Paris and in 1932 the studio arranged for him to work with Carlos Gardel, at a time when the company was looking for ways to increase Gardel's international appeal . Le Pera wrote the scripts for a series of films, including Melod√≠a de Arrabal (1933), Cuesta abajo (1934), El Tango en Broadway (1934), El d√≠a que me quieras (1935) and Tango Bar (1935), and also wrote the lyrics for tangos composed and performed by Gardel in these films. These tangos would become classics of the genre across the Spanish-speaking world. Gardel and Le Pera were coming to the end of a promotional tour for the film El dia que me quieras when, on Monday, 24 June 1935, the plane in which they were taking off from the airport in Medellin, Colombia crashed into another plane on the runway, killing them both and most of the other passengers on board, including the other musicians travelling with them. Le Pera is credited with elevating the literary quality of tango lyrics while respecting the popular character of the musical form.

The word microthermal is derived from two Greek words meaning \\"small\\" and \\"heat\\". This is misleading, however, since the term is intended to describe only the temperature conditions that prevail during the winter months, rather than those of the entire year. The characteristic feature of the microthermal climate is cold winters -- specifically, winters that are cold enough to ensure that snow will remain on the ground continuously for a fixed period of time every year. Conceptually, an average temperature of 0¬∞C or colder is assumed to be necessary to bring this about; thus the climate of a location where at least one full month is this cold is classified as microthermal (however, at least one month in the summer must average 10¬∞C or higher; otherwise the climate would be reckoned as polar). This definition places almost all of the world's microthermal climates in the Northern Hemisphere, as the absence of broad land masses at upper- middle latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere precludes, with few exceptions, the existence of such temperature conditions there. Microthermal climates are typically subdivided into three categories based on the temperature characteristics of the summer season. The southernmost of the three is frequently referred to as the temperate continental climate, and has hot summers -- that is to say, at least one month has an average temperature of 22¬∞C (71.6¬∞F) or above. The middle zone is often labelled hemiboreal, and no summer month there has an average temperature as warm as 22¬∞C, but at least four months will average 10¬∞C (50¬∞F) or higher. The northernmost of the three microthermal zones is the subarctic, or boreal zone; there only one to three months will have average temperatures of at least 10¬∞C. In North America, microthermal climates commence north of Boston along the Atlantic seaboard, this line drifting gradually southward further inland, reaching approximately 38¬∞ at the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains, then curving dramatically northward near the Pacific coast, reaching the Pacific Ocean just south of Juneau, Alaska. In Asia, the latitude at which these climates begin is several degrees lower due to the pervasive influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, or high-pressure system, and in continental Europe the line actually runs longitudinally rather than latitudinally, cutting through central Poland after beginning north of the Arctic Circle along the Norwegian coast, thereafter moving diagonally across Scandinavia. The boundary between the microthermal and polar climate zones is farthest north in western Europe (actually within the Arctic Circle there), and farthest south along the east coast of North America (at about 56¬∞ North latitude on the central coast of Labrador); it then trends northward across Canada before dropping south again as it courses through Alaska. Throughout most of Siberia, the boundary tends to follow the Arctic Circle fairly closely. In addition to having various summer temperature regimes, microthermal climates also differ from one another in how much precipitation they receive -- such climates may be humid, semiarid or arid. Most of the Turkestan-Gobi desert system has an arid microthermal climate, while the best-known example of the semiarid microthermal climate can be found in the \\"steppes of Central Asia\\" immortalized by Russian classical music composer Alexander Borodin.

Description Part of the Kerlescan alignment in Carnac, Brittany Stone rows can be few metres or several kilometres in length and made from stones that can be as tall as 2m, although 1m high stones are more common. The terminals of many rows have the largest stones and other megalithic features are sometimes sited at the ends, especially burial cairns. The stones are placed at intervals and may vary in height along the sequence, to provide a graduated appearance, though it is not known whether this was done deliberately. Stone rows were erected by the later Neolithic and Bronze Age peoples in the British Isles, parts of Scandinavia and northern France. The most famous example is the Carnac stones, a complex of stone rows in Brittany. There are a number of examples on Dartmoor including the row at Stalldown Barrow and three rows at Drizzlecombe and the Hill O Many Stanes in Caithness. In Britain they are exclusively found in isolated moorland areas. The term alignment is sometimes taken to imply that the rows were placed purposely in relation to other factors such as other monuments or topographical or astronomical features. Archaeologists treat stone rows as discrete features however and alignment refers to the stones being lined up with one another rather than anything else. Their purpose is thought to be religious or ceremonial perhaps marking a processual route. Another theory is that each generation would erect a new stone to contribute to a sequence that demonstrated a people's continual presence.

It was founded by Robin Howard in 1966 to train new dancers for his company, London Contemporary Dance Theatre. LCDS is based at The Place in the Bloomsbury area of Central London, close to the Senate House complex of the University of London, RADA and University College London. History London Contemporary Dance School and its partner company, London Contemporary Dance Theatre, were founded in 1966 under the governance of the Contemporary Dance Trust. After receiving support from its founder, Robin Howard, the Contemporary Dance Trust moved to 17 Duke's Road in 1969, which it renamed The Place. In 1978, with assistance from the Arts Council and Linbury Trust, The Place underwent a major redevelopment, with new studios created for the School on Flaxman Terrace. In 1982, LCDS began offering a BA Honours degree in Contemporary Dance, validated by the University of Kent. In 1994, London Contemporary Dance Theatre was closed and the Richard Alston Dance Company formed. In October 2001 a ¬£7.5 million redevelopment of The Place, including the construction of six new dance studios, was completed. In the same year LCDS and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) formed the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama. In 2008 a ¬£1.1 million development at The Place added two new further studios. Teaching LCDS teaches a variety of contemporary dance techniques including release-based, Lim√≥n, Humphrey and Contact Improvisation, priding themselves on their Graham technique and Cunningham technique. As part of its courses LCDS also offers pilates, body conditioning, free electives in Choreology, Anatomy and Scenography, and ballet studies. LCDS provides both undergraduate and postgraduate (including EDge) vocational training as well as a research programme in contemporary dance. The School also offers courses in contemporary dance in London for adults and children, including Centre for Advanced Training, a programme allowing pre vocational training for young people in the South East. Alumni LCDS's first year's intake included Richard Alston, Ian Spink and Siobhan Davies who went on to perform with the main company before founding their own. Other notable alumni of LCDS include: Richard Alston, Darshan Singh Bhuller, Seeta Indrani, Sally Potter, Kenneth Tharp and Paul Liburd.

Since very little is actually known about the life of Leo, the book fills in the historical episodes, placing him in the company of many of the key historical‚Äîpolitical and cultural‚Äîfigures of his time, including Popes Leo X, Adrian VI, and Clement VII; Ottoman emperors Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent; Boabdil, the last Moorish king of Granada; Askia Mohammad I of the Songhai Empire; Ferdinand of Spain; Francis I of France; and artist Raphael along with others. Leo Africanus is Maalouf's first novel and has received high praise. The work explores confrontations between Islam and Christianity as well as the mutual influence that the two religions had on each other and on the people they governed. Summary The book is divided into four sections, each organized year by year to describe a key period of the life of Leo Africanus (originally named Hasan). The book is based on life experiences that took Leo Africanus almost everywhere in the Islamic Mediterranean, from southern Morocco to Arabia, and across the Sahara. It places Hasan/Leo in various historical events and narrates those events. While filled with biographical hypotheses and historical speculations, the book offers a vivid description of the Renaissance world, with the decline of the traditional Muslim kingdoms and the hope inspired by the Ottoman Empire, as it grew to threaten Europe and restore Muslim unity. Each section of the book is named after the city that played the major role in Leo's life at a given time: Granada, Fez, Cairo, and Rome. * In Granada, the book illustrates the Granada War and the Treaty of Granada which marked the end of Islamic rule in Spain, as well as the Alhambra Decree which expelled all Jews from Spain. * In Fez, Maalouf describes the news of the failed Muslim rebellion in Granada, the discussions resulting in the Oran fatwa, the Spanish and Portuguese colonial campaigns in North Africa and their conflicts with the North African Muslims. * In Cairo, it depicts the Ottoman‚ÄìMamluk War which ended in the Ottoman conquest of Egypt. * In Rome, the narration includes an Ottoman embassy to France, the Italian War of 1521‚Äì26, and the War of the League of Cognac, culminating in the 1527 Sack of Rome.  Characters  * Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan, later known as Leo Africanus, the titular character and the narrator of the book. * Muhammad al-Wazzan, Hasan's father, a weighmaster in the Emirate of Granada. * Salma, Hasan's mother and Muhammad's Arab wife. * Warda, Hasan's stepmother and Muhammad's Castilian wife. * Abu Marwan or Khali, Hasan's maternal uncle and a diplomat and statesman in the Kingdom of Fez. * Harun the Ferret, Hasan's closest friend in Fez and later known as Harun Pasha, a diplomat with the Ottoman Empire. * Hiba, a Numidian slave girl gifted to Hasan by an African lord, as well as Hasan's romantic interest. * Nur, a Circassian princess and the widow of Selim I's rival claimant of the Ottoman throne, whom Hasan married in Cairo. * Pope Leo X, Hasan's master after he was captured and enslaved. Later he freed Hasan and baptized him John-Leo. * Francesco Guicciardini, an Italian statesman and one of Leo's friends in Rome. * Julius de' Medici, later Pope Clement VII, Leo's benefactor after the death of Leo X. * Abbad the Soussi, a merchant who was captured together with Hasan, and later became known as Master Abbado, a successful merchant in Naples, and Leo's friend in Italy.

History Management trainer Martin M. Broadwell described the model as \\"the four levels of teaching\\" in February 1969. Paul R. Curtiss and Phillip W. Warren mentioned the model in their 1973 book The Dynamics of Life Skills Coaching. The model was used at Gordon Training International by its employee Noel Burch in the 1970s; there it was called the \\"four stages for learning any new skill\\". Later the model was frequently attributed to Abraham Maslow, incorrectly since the model does not appear in his major works. Overview The four stages suggest that individuals are initially unaware of how little they know, or unconscious of their incompetence. As they recognize their incompetence, they consciously acquire a skill, then consciously use it. Eventually, the skill can be utilized without it being consciously thought through: the individual is said to have then acquired unconscious competence. Several elements, including helping someone \\"know what they don't know\\" or recognize a blind spot, can be compared to some elements of a Johari window, although Johari deals with self- awareness, while the four stages of competence deals with learning stages. Stages The four stages are: # Unconscious incompetence #: The individual does not understand or know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage. The length of time an individual spends in this stage depends on the strength of the stimulus to learn. # Conscious incompetence #: Though the individual does not understand or know how to do something, they recognize the deficit, as well as the value of a new skill in addressing the deficit. The making of mistakes can be integral to the learning process at this stage. # Conscious competence #: The individual understands or knows how to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge requires concentration. It may be broken down into steps, and there is heavy conscious involvement in executing the new skill. # Unconscious competence #: The individual has had so much practice with a skill that it has become \\"second nature\\" and can be performed easily. As a result, the skill can be performed while executing another task. The individual may be able to teach it to others, depending upon how and when it was learned.

He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Limerick East constituency and was Minister of State for Disability and Mental Health at the Department of Health and Children. O'Malley was born in Barrington Street in Limerick. He was educated at Crescent College, Limerick and University College Dublin where he received a Bachelor of Science Pharmacy. Before entering electoral politics, O'Malley managed his own pharmacy in the Limerick city suburb of Dooradoyle. He served as president of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, the representative body for over 1400 community pharmacies in Ireland. He was also awarded a fellowship by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland for services rendered to the profession. He later withdrew from management and ownership of the pharmacy business to concentrate full-time on politics. He first held political office in 1991 when he was elected to Limerick County Council. O'Malley was elected to D√°il √âireann at the 2002 general election. In 2001 he was appointed Health spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, and successfully spearheaded his party's campaign to have a Treatment Purchase Fund included in the Government Health Strategy, as a means of reducing public patient waiting lists in Irish hospitals. When O'Malley was in government, he set up an expert group to formulate National policy for Mental Health in Ireland. In 2003 he called for the Health Board system to be abolished. In 2006 he launched the new policy Vision For Change and it became government policy. He was very involved in bringing radiotherapy services to Limerick, in spite of national reports which said that there should only be three radiotherapy centres in Ireland, in Dublin, Cork and Galway. O'Malley also convinced his ministerial colleagues that a new graduate-entry medical school should be set up in University Limerick. In December of that year he came under increasing pressure from opposition TDs to resign following a Prime Time Investigates television programme broadcast on RT√â One which criticised the lack of mental health services available for Irish children. He implied in the programme that long waiting lists for psychiatric services were in some cases engineered by psychiatrists themselves in search of a feeling of power. He lost his seat at the 2007 general election.

The maximum degree of a graph G, denoted by \\\\Delta(G), and the minimum degree of a graph, denoted by \\\\delta(G), are the maximum and minimum degree of its vertices. In the multigraph on the right, the maximum degree is 5 and the minimum degree is 0. In a regular graph, every vertex has the same degree, and so we can speak of the degree of the graph. A complete graph (denoted K_n, where n is the number of vertices in the graph) is a special kind of regular graph where all vertices have the maximum degree, n-1. Handshaking lemma The degree sum formula states that, given a graph G=(V, E), :\\\\sum_{v \\\\in V} \\\\deg(v) = 2E\\\\, . The formula implies that in any undirected graph, the number of vertices with odd degree is even. This statement (as well as the degree sum formula) is known as the handshaking lemma. The latter name comes from a popular mathematical problem, to prove that in any group of people the number of people who have shaken hands with an odd number of other people from the group is even. Degree sequence Two non-isomorphic graphs with the same degree sequence (3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1). The degree sequence of an undirected graph is the non-increasing sequence of its vertex degrees;Diestel p.216 for the above graph it is (5, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0). The degree sequence is a graph invariant so isomorphic graphs have the same degree sequence. However, the degree sequence does not, in general, uniquely identify a graph; in some cases, non-isomorphic graphs have the same degree sequence. The degree sequence problem is the problem of finding some or all graphs with the degree sequence being a given non-increasing sequence of positive integers. (Trailing zeroes may be ignored since they are trivially realized by adding an appropriate number of isolated vertices to the graph.) A sequence which is the degree sequence of some graph, i.e. for which the degree sequence problem has a solution, is called a graphic or graphical sequence. As a consequence of the degree sum formula, any sequence with an odd sum, such as (3, 3, 1), cannot be realized as the degree sequence of a graph. The converse is also true: if a sequence has an even sum, it is the degree sequence of a multigraph. The construction of such a graph is straightforward: connect vertices with odd degrees in pairs by a matching, and fill out the remaining even degree counts by self-loops. The question of whether a given degree sequence can be realized by a simple graph is more challenging. This problem is also called graph realization problem and can either be solved by the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGallai theorem or the Havel‚ÄìHakimi algorithm. The problem of finding or estimating the number of graphs with a given degree sequence is a problem from the field of graph enumeration. More generally, the degree sequence of a hypergraph is the non- increasing sequence of its vertex degrees. A sequence is k-graphic if it is the degree sequence of some k-uniform hypergraph. In particular, a 2-graphic sequence is graphic. Deciding if a given sequence is k-graphic is doable in polynomial time for k=2 via the Erd≈ës‚ÄìGallai theorem but is NP-complete for all k\\\\ge 3 (Deza et al., 2018 ). Special values An undirected graph with leaf nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12 *A vertex with degree 0 is called an isolated vertex. *A vertex with degree 1 is called a leaf vertex or end vertex, and the edge incident with that vertex is called a pendant edge. In the graph on the right, {3,5} is a pendant edge. This terminology is common in the study of trees in graph theory and especially trees as data structures. * A vertex with degree n ‚àí 1 in a graph on n vertices is called a dominating vertex. Global properties *If each vertex of the graph has the same degree k the graph is called a k-regular graph and the graph itself is said to have degree k. Similarly, a bipartite graph in which every two vertices on the same side of the bipartition as each other have the same degree is called a biregular graph. *An undirected, connected graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has either 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. If it has 0 vertices of odd degree, the Eulerian path is an Eulerian circuit. *A directed graph is a pseudoforest if and only if every vertex has outdegree at most 1\\\\. A functional graph is a special case of a pseudoforest in which every vertex has outdegree exactly 1\\\\. *By Brooks' theorem, any graph other than a clique or an odd cycle has chromatic number at most Œî, and by Vizing's theorem any graph has chromatic index at most Œî + 1\\\\. *A k-degenerate graph is a graph in which each subgraph has a vertex of degree at most k.

He was re-elected at 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007 general elections. He was a member of Kildare County Council from 1999 to 2004 In 1991, Power was a key member of the so-called \\"gang of four\\" which proposed a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, and the leader of his party, Charles Haughey. The other members of the group were Noel Dempsey, Liam Fitzgerald and M. J. Nolan. That incident led to Albert Reynolds's first bid for the leadership and to Haughey's eventual resignation in 1992. When Reynolds eventually became Taoiseach, Power was appointed Assistant Chief Whip. He served as a member of the Joint Committees on European Affairs and on the Environment and Local Government. In Bertie Ahern's Cabinet reshuffle of 2004, Power received the post of Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for Health Promotion.

As seen in at least two instances, the Original Series episodes \\"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\\" and \\"Day of the Dove,\\" it can also serve as an emergency signaling device/beacon, similar to a transponder. The communicator allows direct contact between individuals or via a ship's communication system. The communicator in the Star Trek universe surpasses the capabilities of modern mobile phone technology, the prototypes of which it inspired. It allows crew members to contact starships in orbit without relying on an artificial satellite to relay the signal. Communicators use subspace transmissions that do not conform to normal rules of physics in that signals can bypass EM interference, and the devices allow nearly instantaneous communication at distances that would otherwise require more time to traverse. In Star Trek: The Original Series (TOS), communicators functioned as a plot device, stranding characters in challenging situations when they malfunctioned, were lost or stolen, or went out of range. Otherwise, the transporter could have allowed characters to return to the ship at the first sign of trouble, ending the storyline prematurely. Development of communicators The Next Generation and the early episodes of Deep Space 9. Throughout Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Trek: The Original Series, on-ship communication is achieved via communicator panels on desks and walls, and sometimes through the use of videophones. While formed into a landing party, the crew carried hand-held communicators that flip open. The top section contains a transceiver antenna and the bottom contains user controls, a speaker and a microphone. The device was designed and built by Wah Chang, who also built many of the other props used in the series. Wrist-worn communicators were used in Star Trek: The Motion Picture and remained in use by some Starfleet installations and vessels during the time of The Wrath of Khan. However, the traditional handheld communicator returned in later films. The reason for the switch was not explained, but the non-canon source Mister Scott's Guide to the Enterprise offered the explanation that Starfleet discontinued use of the wrist-worn communicators when they were determined to be prone to repeated failures after suffering minor impacts. Star Trek: Generations. This was also used on Voyager and the later episodes of Deep Space 9 as well as the last three TNG films and in the flashback scenes of Picard. In Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) and later series, Starfleet officers and enlisted personnel wear small communicator badges on their left breast. These devices are in the shape of the Starfleet insignia and are activated with a light tap. They also incorporate the universal translator. There have been four versions of the communicator badge seen on screen. The first was a prototype used by members of Section 31 during the second season of Star Trek: Discovery (DIS). The second was used through TNG and in the first two seasons of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9). The third was used in the last five seasons of DS9, throughout Star Trek: Voyager, the four TNG films, and in flashback scenes in Star Trek: Picard (PIC). The fourth was seen in use in 2399 in Picard. Use of the modern badges dates back at least as far as the time of the Enterprise-C. (Lt. Richard Castillo is shown wearing a communicator badge in the TNG episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise.\\") According to Data in the episode \\"Time's Arrow, Part One\\" at a poker game in 1893, the badge is made out of a crystalline composite of silicon, beryllium, carbon 70 and gold. In Deep Space Nine, Bajoran officers and enlisted personnel also wear a small communicator badge that functions much the same as their Starfleet counterparts. However, Bajorans wear their badges on the right breast of their uniform tunics. Cardassians are shown wearing their communicators on their left wrist. While wall and desk panels are still present, officers and crew consider them a secondary system, relying primarily on the badges. Viewscreens are used for visual communications. In Starfleet vessels and installations, communication can also be accomplished by verbally directing the computer to initiate communications with another person. Relation to current real technology On July 12, 2010, CBS released an iPhone application, created by Talkndog Mobile, called Star Trek Communicator. The application replicated the design and iconic chirp of the communicator. In June 2016, The Wand Company Ltd. released a highly accurate and working replica of the Star Trek: The Original Series Communicator using Bluetooth to enable it to pair with, and connect to, a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone so as to allow it to be used in exactly the way envisioned in the original Star Trek TV show; to make and receive calls. Advances in voice recognition and cloud- based artificial intelligence allow the user to use voice dialing via the rather simple interface, but also to ask questions using Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana or any other digital personal assistant through the Communicator. This is much the same as when a member of the Enterprise crew in the original series asks the ship's computer to find a colleague or ask for a status update. In December 2016, Fametek LLC. released the Star Trek: The Next Generation CommBadge using Bluetooth 4.2 technology to enable it to pair with a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone or tablet to make and receive calls and utilizes voice commands via Siri, Google Assistant or Cortana. The Bluetooth ComBadge also has a Cos-Play mode which when pressed activates the same Chirp sound effect as seen on the show. No real-world equivalent to subspace communication has been developed, proposed, or theorized. However, many other aspects of Starfleet communications technology are commonplace. For example, locator/transponder functionality is implemented via GPS, LoJack, RFID, and radio direction finder devices, and cloud-based digital assistants perform in a way similar to the artificial intelligence of a Starfleet ship's computer.

David Thomas Ansted FRS (5 February 181413 May 1880) was an English professor of geology and author of numerous books on geology. His role as a teacher at Addiscombe Military Seminary, where future East India Company army officers were trained, had an influence on the study of geology in the colonies.  Youth, education  Ansted was born in London on 5 February 1814 to William Ansted. He was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, and inspired by Adam Sedgwick took an interest in geology. After taking an MA degree in 1839, he was elected to fellow of the college. He was appointed professor of geology at King's College London in 1840, holding the post until 1853. From 1845, he was also a lecturer at the East India Company's Military Seminary at Addiscombe (until its closure in 1861), and professor of geology at the College for Civil Engineers at Putney. His Elementary Course of Geology textbook was awarded as a prize to cadets at Addiscombe. The cadets themselves were posted to India and other colonies where some pursued geology. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1844, and from that date until 1847 he was vice-secretary of the Geological Society. The practical side of geology now came to occupy his attention and he visited various parts of Europe as a consulting geologist and mining engineer. In 1868, Ansted became an Examiner in Physical Geography to the Science and Art Department of King's College. In 1870 he was awarded a Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers for his paper \\"On the Lagoons and Marshes of certain parts of the Shores of the Mediterranean\\".  Travel and writing  Ansted's Gold-Seekers Manual (1849) attempted to improve the prospects of emigrants to the California gold rush. His other published works include Geology, Introductory, Descriptive, & Practical (1844), The Geologist's Text- Book (1845), Syllabus of Lectures on Mineralogy, Geology, and Practical Geology (1848), An Elementary Course of Geology, Mineralogy, and Physical Geography (1850), The Great Stone Book of Nature (1853), The Applications of Geology to the Arts and Manufactures (1865). He was the co-author with Robert Gordon Latham of The Channel Islands (1862). By 1853, Ansted's reputation was sufficient that he was hired by potential investors to survey promising coal fields along the New River in southern Virginia in the United States, and he was one of the earlier geologists to identify the rich bituminous coal seams which lay there. His work set the stage for a mining boom in the area, where he invested in land along the Midland Trail in Fayette County in what became the new state of West Virginia in 1863 during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65). A prot√©g√© of Ansted, William Nelson Page (1854‚Äì1932), became a leading industrialist and developer of iron furnaces, coal mines and railroads in the area, leading and managing such enterprises as the Victoria Furnace in Goshen, Virginia and the Gauley Mountain Coal Company for absentee investors, many of whom were based overseas in the United Kingdom. Ansted collaborated with numerous scientists of the period and like many others he entered into a correspondence with Charles Darwin in about 1860. Personal life Ansted married Augusta Dorothea Hackett (1828-1897), daughter of Alexander Baillie on 24 June 1848 and they had six children. Ansted died at Melton near Woodbridge, Suffolk, on 13 May 1880. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

Urakami was an area in the northern part of the city of Nagasaki, Japan. History In 1614, by the orders of sh≈çgun leader Tokugawa Ieyasu, Christianity was banned in Japan in order to suppress European influence and to prevent the undermining of the Japanese government. Most Japanese Christians who openly spoke about their religion were open to prosecution and subject to extreme harsh treatment, such as torture or crucifixion. As a result, Urakami became the stronghold for oppressed believers who steadfastly adhered to their religion in secret.A stronghold for believers of a banned Christian faith. The center of Nagasaki that experienced an atomic bomb blast. During this time period, the Oura Cathedral played the important role as spiritual support for Christians in Urakami. The existence of Christians within the Urakami area resulted the Japanese government to launch a crackdown in order to implement the ban. On September 1, 1790, the first persecution began in Urakami; hidden Christians were discovered and arrested, though there were no deaths. In 1839, a new wave of persecution was launched in Urakami, though this too didn‚Äôt result in any deaths either. But in the third kuzure (literally, ‚Äùdisintegration\\"), conducted in 1859, more than 10 people died under torture. The fourth and final persecution was conducted between 1867 and 1873, better known as the Urakami Yoban Kuzure.Under the Sign of Assumption During the process, 68 residents of Urakami were arrested and were forced to renounce their religion entirely. This led to protests from foreign consuls, and the Tokugawa Shogunate relented. However, soon after Tokugawa Shogunate ended and in February 1868 the new Meiji government appointed Sawa Nobuyoshi in charge of public order in Ky≈´sh≈´. His dislike of all things foreign was well known, and, after consultation, he decided to deal with the problem once and for all. His plan to exile the entire village was approved by an Imperial council on 25 April and implemented in two stages: first the ringleaders to Hagi, Tsuwano and Fukuyama, and then the rest of the village. Families were split up, and in total 3,414 Christian men, women, and children were sent into exile to all over Japan: 500 to Kanazawa, 160 to Tsuwano, 150 to Satsuma, 117 to Tsuru Shima, Okayama, etc.Izumi Interview in, Photo-Documentary of Christian history in Japan with Concentration on Hidden Christians, Eagan, B., St. Olaf College (2006). Retrieved 2009-09-15. http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/asian- studies/projects/kakurekirishitan/transcripts.html However, under pressure, and wanting to keep the relationship with the United States and European countries, especially after the Japanese government opened to the world in the 1850s, the ban was lifted in 1873 and the Japanese Christians were finally able to return to Urakami. In 1895, Christians built the first cathedral in Japan in the Urakami area. The construction of the cathedral was fully completed in 1925. On August 9, 1945, near the end of World War II, Urakami became the site for ground zero when the atomic bomb exploded at about a height of . The damage caused by the heat rays and the blast was almost entirely restricted to this area, while the Nakashima area was fairly well shielded by the hills. However, 36% of the total structures in both areas were damaged. The Urakami Cathedral was also heavily damaged during the blast. Following the war, Urakami was rebuilt and now houses the once-damaged Cathedral site.

Early life The daughter of American comedian Fred Duprez and Australian Florence Isabelle Matthews, she was born in Teddington, Middlesex, England, during an air raid in the final months of World War I. Career She began acting in her adolescence with the Coventry Repertory Company after studying at the Froebel Institute, and was a film extra in 1935 before appearing in The Crimson Circle the following year. Her next film was The Cardinal (1936), and she had a small role in The Spy in Black (1939), but it was her fourth film, the epic London Films adaptation of A. E. W. Mason's The Four Feathers (1939), that made her a film star, acting opposite John Clements, Ralph Richardson, and C. Aubrey Smith. Her peak of success came with the fantasy film The Thief of Bagdad (1940), which she also made for Alexander Korda's London Films (on locations in the United Kingdom, northern Africa, and the Grand Canyon in Arizona). Korda took charge of her career after this point and brought her to Hollywood where he set her asking price at $50,000 per film. However, as Duprez had not yet achieved the level of popularity in the United States that she had in the United Kingdom, this tactic only served to place her out of contention for most roles. When she was finally released from Korda's contract, she appeared in such low budget fare as They Raid by Night (1942), Little Tokyo, U.S.A. (1942), and Tiger Fangs (1943). Clifford Odets' grim None But the Lonely Heart (1944), in which she co-starred with Cary Grant and Ethel Barrymore, commenced a brief return to films of higher production values. Duprez joined a top ensemble cast in Ren√© Clair's film version of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (1945). That same year, she appeared opposite John Loder in The Brighton Strangler. In the film noir Calcutta (1947), she starred with Alan Ladd, Gail Russell, and William Bendix. After a few more motion pictures, Duprez moved to New York City for a brief career on and off Broadway. She appeared in \\"The Last Tycoon,\\" an episode of the Robert Montgomery Presents television show in 1951, and her final credited film performance was in One Plus One (1961), also titled Exploring the Kinsey Reports. =Music= Duprez composed \\"I Woke Up and Started Dreaming\\", a song that Bing Crosby's music company bought and published. =Radio= On 10 September 1944, Duprez starred in \\"Forever Walking Free,\\" an episode of Silver Theater on CBS radio. She also starred in the June 20, 1946 episode of Suspense, titled \\"Your Devoted Wife,\\" also on CBS radio. Personal life and death During World War II, after her father's death, Duprez and her mother were unable to use money that they had in England. They sold or pawned jewels to stay afloat financially, and eventually Duprez sent her mother to Australia, where she had access to the British funds. Duprez married her first husband Frederick Beauchamp, a wealthy Harley Street doctor, in 1935, but they divorced in 1942 when his jealousy of her film stardom had eroded their marriage. She married for a second time in October 1948 to George Moffett, Jr., a wealthy sportsman. They had two daughters, but divorced in 1965. Duprez lived in Rome, Italy, for several years, then returned to London to live out the remainder of her life in a flat in the affluent Knightsbridge area, having a close relationship with an English nobleman. She died there, after a long period of illness on 30 October 1984 at age 66 and was buried at Streatham Park Cemetery.

The bees were first introduced in the United States in the 19th century. The Caucasian honey bee was a subspecies that came to have enduring interest to U.S. beekeepers. Frank Benton (1852‚Äì1919) visited Georgia in 1905 and supported the import of honeybees to the United States.Status of breeding practices and genetic diversity in domestic U.S. honey bees The Russian revolution and consequent annexation of Georgia by the Red Army in 1921 halted the export of Caucasian honey bees. Subspecies were studied and cultivated primarily by Soviet entomologists. Soviet officials were concerned about preserving the purity of the Caucasian subspecies and outlawed any export without special permission. International exports were continued from 1969. According to a UK newspaper \\"GOLDEN BEE the grey mountain bee of the Soviet Union has been judged the best in the world and awarded a gold medal. The grey Caucasian bee is distinguished for its industry and it collects honey, even when it is raining.

It tells the story of Tuvia Bielski, Alexander Zeisal Bielski (Zus), Aharon Bielski, and Asael Bielski, four Jewish brothers who established a large partisan camp in the forests of Belarus during World War II which participated in resistance activities against the Nazi occupation of the country, and so saved 1,200 Jews from the Nazis. The book describes how, in 1941, three brothers witnessed their parents and two other siblings being led away to their eventual murders. The brothers fought back against Germans and collaborators, waging guerrilla warfare in the forests of Belarus. By using their intimate knowledge of the dense forests surrounding the towns of Lida and Novogrudek, the Bielskis evaded the Nazis and established a hidden base camp, then set about convincing other Jews to join their ranks. The Germans came upon them once but were unable to get rid of them. As more Jews arrived each day, a robust community began to emerge; a \\"Jerusalem in the woods\\". In July 1944, after some 30 months in the woods, the Bielskis learned that the Germans, overrun by the Red Army, were retreating back toward Berlin.The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 Jews, Harper Perennial: 2004; At the end of the war, with Soviet control of Belarus becoming increasingly oppressive, the surviving Bielskis fled to Romania, traveling on to the British Mandate of Palestine and eventually to the United States. Asael was drafted into the Soviet Red Army and was killed in action at Marlbork in 1944. Critical reaction Publishers Weekly wrote: \\"This is a story about heroes, and Duffy does a masterful job of telling it.\\" The publication noted that, after the war when Tuvia Bielski was living in Brooklyn, \\"no one knew that the local immigrant truck driver had once commanded the feared Bielski brigade. It is time the three brothers received their due.\\" The Library Journal critic wrote that the book \\"relates in vivid detail the World War II saga of the Bielski partisans\\", adding \\"[a]lthough clearly impressed with the Bielskis' accomplishments, as well as with the men themselves, Duffy does not let that detract from recounting the less noble aspects of partisan life.\\" The critic for the Kirkus Reviews called it a \\"powerful recounting of a little-known story\\" and that the book was \\"more uplifting than most\\" Holocaust books, adding that the \\"day-in, day-out account of the next four years is an often unbearably intense chronicle of horror and courage. A novel telling a similar story would almost certainly be dismissed as outlandish, but Duffy's copious endnotes convincingly document the saga's reality.\\"KIRKUS REVIEW, posted online in 2010 Footnotes References * Peter Duffy, The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 Jews, Harper Perennial, 2004, Further reading * Tec, Nechama.

Interest in music Being an admirer of Elvis Presley, Megas welcomed the arrival of rock & roll to Iceland by 1956, although his interest in music had to be postponed while he attended grammar school in 1960. While he was young, he studied piano and showed skill at painting. He wrote outrageous short stories for the school papers and in 1968 he also published the sheet music and lyrics to 14 songs, many of which would be released on his first records. As a young bohemian writer, he was inspired by Bob Dylan and Ray Davies, and embarked into songwriting, but his works were not copies of the American or British idols, but in fact, his songs were very original. First release and controversy At the beginning of the seventies, his music works were not accessible as Megas only performed them to his friends of the left-wing circles. However, in 1972, Icelandic students in Oslo, Norway helped him release his first album, in which diabolic and satiric lyrics were accompanied by a mild acoustic music played by Norwegian folk musicians. This work caused controversy and his music was banned by the Icelandic national radio, but Megas became a cult figure in the growing alternative scene. In 1973, as Megas found it difficult to release further albums, he published his verses and music in 3 books. When his original lyrics were performed with the electric rock band Judas in 1975, Megas managed to reach a broader audience. Several of those songs lampooned the Icelandic cultural legacy, including his two next albums: Millilending (1975) and Fram og aftur blindg√∂tuna (1976), which were much heavier than the first one. He focused on topics that challenged all of Icelandic society‚Äôs taboos with references made to classical literature and a sarcastic revisionist history. His work polarized the audience. His songs' remarkable poetry and use of Icelandic language proved a novel way to boost Icelandic rock and roll. In 1977, Megas released √Å bleikum n√°ttkj√≥lum with the accompaniment of Spilverk √æj√≥√∞anna, a popular folk-rock band. This album was voted the best Icelandic album ever made, and with a variety of music styles, it features what many critics considered the first Icelandic punk song. By the end of the seventies, Megas was perceived as a provocateur and his important role in the Icelandic rock scene turned him into a reference for future artists. He then released a children‚Äôs song album and a double live album and withdrew from the Icelandic music and started working as a dock worker and graduated from arts school. Back to music By 1983 reappeared in the Icelandic music scene by collaborating with other bands and playing as a guest musicians on several albums. Towards 1985 joined Kukl in a new project was named MegaKukl and toured all over Iceland recording around 20 songs which still remain as unpublished material. After seven years of absence, his solo career was resumed in 1986 with the release of √ç g√≥√∞ri tr√∫. In 1990 Megas released H√¶ttuleg hlj√≥msveit & gl√¶pakvendi√∞ Stella, and started a new project music with Kukl members called H√¶ttuleg hlj√≥msveit (A Dangerous Band), featuring singer Bj√∂rk as backing vocalist. The present Megas has remained one of the most important Icelandic artists. Considered the father of Icelandic rock and acclaimed for his prolific and, sometimes controversial works, his complete discography up to 1990 was reissued in 2002, remastered and with bonus tracks. More recently, he joined S√∫kkat to create a new project called Megasukk and released H√∫s Datt, their debut album in 2005. Some of the artists that have worked with Megas are the following: Bj√∂rgvin G√≠slason, Bj√∂rn Bjarnason, Bragi Kristj√≥nsson, Gu√∞laugur Kristinn √ìttarsson, Hj√°lmar Sveinsson, P√°ll Baldvin Baldvinsson, P√°ll Valsson, Svavar Gestsson, √û√≥r√∞ur Magn√∫sson, and √û√≥runn Valdimarsd√≥ttir, among many others. Trivia Megas is mentioned in the song \\"Iceland\\" by The Fall which appeared on Hex Enduction Hour (1982). The song was recorded in Hlj√≥√∞riti studio in Iceland in 1981. In a Melody Maker article about The Fall's stay in Iceland called \\"The Decline and Fall in Iceland\\" (published 26 September 1981) is this written about Megas: \\"Our hosts play us tapes of a man with a cracked voice and a Dylanish air and describe him as ‚Äúthe father of Icelandic rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll‚Äù. And they tell us the story of Megas, who ridiculed the sacred Sagas of the land, wrote scathing, surreal lyrics, got heavily into booze and drugs, was barred from radio and shunned by society. In 1979 he released a double album called ‚ÄúPlans For Suicide‚Äù announced his retirement, and hasn‚Äôt performed in public since he‚Äôs now a dock worker. Mark Smith is entranced by the story, and rivetted by the music. The following day Megas, a pale, gaunt figure, turns up at The Fall‚Äôs concert at the Austurb√¶jarb√≠√≥ and shakes him by the hand. Mark will return to England clutching a parcel of Megas records under his arm.\\" Solo career Albums: *1972 - Megas (MGAB 720601), re-release in 2002 with bonus tracks. *1975 - Millilending (Demant D1-002), re-release in 2002 with bonus tracks. *1976 - Fram og aftur blindg√∂tuna (Hr√≠m hf D1-005), re-release in 2002 with bonus tracks. *1977 - √Å bleikum n√°ttkj√≥lum (I√∞unn 002), with Spilverk √ûj√≥√∞anna, re- release in 2002 with bonus tracks. *1978 - N√∫ er √©g kl√¶ddur og kominn √° r√≥l (I√∞unn 004), re-release in 2002 with bonus tracks. *1979 - Dr√∂g a√∞ sj√°lfsmor√∞i (I√∞unn 008-09), live album recorded 1978. *1985 - Megas allur, box set with all previous albums and two bonus LP's with rare and unreleased tracks. *1986 - √ç g√≥√∞ri tr√∫ (Hitt leikh√∫si√∞ HITT 011), re-release in 2002 with bonus tracks. *1987 - Loftmynd, re-release in 2002 with bonus tracks. *1988 - H√∂fu√∞lausnir, re-release in 2002 with bonus tracks. *1990 - H√¶ttuleg hlj√≥msveit & gl√¶pakvendi√∞ Stella (Megas), re-release in 2006 with bonus tracks. *1992 - √ûr√≠r bl√≥√∞dropar, re-release in 2006 with bonus tracks. *1993 - Parad√≠sarfuglinn, best-of compilation. *1994 - Dr√∂g a√∞ Upprisu (Japis), live album by Megas and N√Ωd√∂nsk recorded 1993, re-release in 2006 with bonus tracks. *1996 - Til hamingju me√∞ falli√∞ *1997 - Fl√°a ver√∂ld *2000 - Svanas√∂ngur √° lei√∞i *2001 - Far... √æinn veg *2001 - Haugbrot *2002 - Englaryk √≠ t√≠maglasi, re-release of Bl√°ir draumar (1988) with bonus tracks. *2002 - Megas 1972-2002, best-of compilation. *2002 - (Kristilega k√¶rleiksbl√≥min spretta √≠ kringum) hitt og √æetta, a bonus cd with Megas 1972-2002 with rare and unrelaesed tracks. *2006 - Pass√≠us√°lmar √≠ Sk√°lholti (Tindur), live album recorded 2001. *2006 - Greinilegur p√∫ls, live album recorded with H√¶ttuleg hlj√≥msveit 1991. *2007 - Fr√°gangur, with Senu√æj√≥farnir. *2007 - Hold er mold, with Senu√æj√≥farnir. *2008 - √Å morgun, with Senu√æj√≥farnir. *2009 - Seg√∞u ekki fr√° (me√∞ l√≠fsmarki), live album with Senu√æj√≥farnir, recorded in 2007. *2011 - (Hugbo√∞ um) Vandr√¶√∞i, with Senu√æj√≥farnir. *2011 - A√∞f√∂r a√∞ l√∂gum, with Strengir. *2013 - Jeppi √° fjalli, with Bragi Valdimar Sk√∫lason. = MegaKukl (1985) = *No official releases: - Megas and Kukl recorded about 20 songs but the original tapes are lost. = H√¶ttuleg hlj√≥msveit (1990) = *No official releases: - Megas and Kukl recorded some tracks at Pulsinn. =Discography of Megasukk= *2005 - H√∫s Datt =Tribute albums= *1997 - Megasarl√∂g by various artists. *2006 - P√¶ldu √≠ √æv√≠ sem p√¶landi er √≠ by various artists. *2006 - Magga St√≠na syngur Megas by Magga St√≠na Bibliography by Megas *1968 - Megas I (Megas), reprinted in 1973. *1968 - Megas II (Megas), reprinted in 1973. *1973 - Megas III (Megas). *1991 - Textar (Almenna b√≥kaf√©lagi√∞). *1989 - S√≥l √≠ Nor√∞urm√Ωri: P√≠slarsaga √∫r Austurb√¶ together with √û√≥runn Valdimarsd√≥ttir, reprinted in 1993. *1994 - Bj√∂rn og Sveinn e√∞a makleg m√°lagj√∂ld (M√°l og menning). *2012 - Megas: Textar 1966-2011 (Reykjav√≠k: JPV) Related bibliography *Rokksaga √çslands, by Gestur Gu√∞mundsson.

A person with severe hyperacusis has difficulty tolerating everyday sounds, which become painful or loud. The prevalence of hyperacusis is 1 in 50,000 people. Hyperacusis is often coincident with tinnitus. However, tinnitus is more common and there are important differences between their involved mechanisms. Signs and symptoms In hyperacusis, the symptoms are ear pain, annoyance, distortions, and general intolerance to many sounds that most people are unaffected by. Crying spells or panic attacks may result from the experience of hyperacusis. It may affect either or both ears. Hyperacusis can also be accompanied by tinnitus. Hyperacusis can result in anxiety, stress and phonophobia. Avoidant behavior is often a response to prevent the effects of hyperacusis and this can include avoiding social situations. The University of Iowa proposed four sub-categories of the condition: * pain: sufferers experience discomfort or pain in reaction to certain sounds, usually those that are loud or high in frequency. Pain can be felt in the form of stabbing, burning, coolness, or pain that radiates down the neck. * loudness: sounds are perceived as louder than their actual decibel level. * annoyance: certain sounds are irritating. * fear: sufferers begin avoiding everyday sounds out of fear of triggering symptoms, often isolating themselves at home. =Associated conditions= Some conditions that are associated with hyperacusis include: * Acoustic shock * Adverse drug reaction * Anxiety * Asperger's Syndrome * Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder * Autism spectrum * Bell's palsy * Depression * Endolymphatic hydrops * Hypothyroidism * Lyme disease * Migraine * M√©ni√®re's disease * Multiple sclerosis * Noise-induced hearing loss * Posttraumatic stress disorder * Severe head trauma * Superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) * Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) * Tay‚ÄìSachs disease * Tonic tensor tympani syndrome * Visual snow * Williams syndrome Causes The most common cause of hyperacusis is overexposure to excessively high decibel (sound pressure) levels. Some sufferers acquire hyperacusis suddenly as a result of taking ear sensitizing drugs, Lyme disease, M√©ni√®re's disease, head injury, or surgery. Others are born with sound sensitivity, develop superior canal dehiscence syndrome, have had a history of ear infections, or come from a family that has had hearing problems. Bell's palsy can trigger hyperacusis if the associated flaccid paralysis affects the tensor tympani, and stapedius, two small muscles of the middle ear. Some psychoactive drugs such as LSD, methaqualone, or phencyclidine (angel-dust) can cause hyperacusis. An antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, has also been seen to be a cause, known as ciprofloxacin-related hyperacusis.  Neurophysiological mechanisms  As one important mechanism, adaptation processes in the auditory brain that influence the dynamic range of neural responses are assumed to be distorted by irregular input from the inner ear. This is mainly caused by hearing loss related damage in the inner ear. The mechanism behind hyperacusis is not currently known, but it is suspected to be caused by damage to the inner ear and cochlea. It is theorized that type II afferent fibers become excited after damage to hair cells and synapses, triggering a release of ATP in response. This release of ATP results in pain, sound sensitivity, and cochlear inflammation.  Diagnosis  Loudness discomfort levels (LDLs): group data of hyperacusis patients without hearing loss. Upper line: average hearing thresholds. Lower long line: LDLs of this group. Lower short line: LDLs of a reference group with normal hearing. The basic diagnostic test is similar to a normal audiogram. The difference is that additionally to the hearing threshold at each test frequency also the lowest uncomfortable sound level is measured. This level is called loudness discomfort level (LDL), uncomfortable listening level (UCL), or uncomfortable loudness level (ULL). In patients with hyperacusis this level is considerably lower than in normal subjects, and usually across most parts of the auditory spectrum. Treatment One possible treatment for hyperacusis is retraining therapy which uses broadband noise. Tinnitus retraining therapy, a treatment originally used to treat tinnitus, uses broadband noise to treat hyperacusis. Pink noise can also be used to treat hyperacusis. By listening to broadband noise at soft levels for a disciplined period of time each day, patients can rebuild (i.e., re-establish) their tolerances to sound. Although patients might not always make a complete recovery, the use of broadband noise usually gives some of them a significant improvement in their symptoms, especially if this is combined with counseling. Another possible treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which may also be combined with retraining therapy. Notable cases * Musician Jason DiEmilio of Azusa Plane had hyperacusis and ultimately went on to commit suicide. His story was told in BuzzFeed. * Musician Stephin Merritt has monaural hyperacusis in his left ear, which influences the instrumentation of his band, The Magnetic Fields, leads him to wear earplugs during performances and to cover his affected ear during audience applause. * Musician Laura Ballance of Superchunk has hyperacusis and no longer tours with the band. * American politician, activist, and film producer Michael Huffington has mild hyperacusis and underwent sound therapy after finding that running tap water caused ear pain. * Russian communist revolutionary, politician, and political theorist Vladimir Lenin was reported seriously ill by the latter half of 1921, having hyperacusis and symptoms such as regular headache and insomnia.Shub 1966, p. 426; Rice 1990, p. 187; Service 2000, p. 435. * Musician Chris Singleton had hyperacusis, but made a full recovery. His story was told in The Independent. * Musician Peter Silberman of The Antlers had hyperacusis and tinnitus which put his musical career on hold, but was quoted saying it died down to a 'manageable level' He has now resumed his musical career. * Voice actor Liam O'Brien has hyperacusis, and is quoted as having lost sleep during the time of diagnosis.

It was discovered by William Herschel in 1792. It is formed by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 (HD 192163) colliding with and energizing the slower moving wind ejected by the star when it became a red giant around 250,000 to 400,000 years ago. The result of the collision is a shell and two shock waves, one moving outward and one moving inward. The inward moving shock wave heats the stellar wind to X-ray-emitting temperatures. It is a rather faint object located about 2 degrees SW of Sadr. For most telescopes it requires a UHC or OIII filter to see. Under favorable circumstances a telescope as small as 8 cm (with filter) can see its nebulosity. Larger telescopes (20 cm or more) reveal the crescent or a Euro sign shape which makes some to call it the \\"Euro sign nebula\\".

M. Kabbary and M. C. Hately in 1986, which was claimed to have the same efficiency as a conventional antenna but only one- tenth the overall height. The invention was received with incredulity from experts in electromagnetics and antenna technology owing to the deficient theoretical justifications offered and the lack of viable experimental verification. Although the antenna was installed in a few broadcasting stations in the 1990s, performance has not borne out the claims of the inventors. Description As with other low frequency antennas, the crossed field antenna is installed above a ground plane which may be the Earth. It consists of three electrically active parts: *A horizontal metal disc (or \\"D-plate\\") raised above and insulated from the ground plane; *A vertical hollow metal cylinder (or \\"E-plate\\") of smaller diameter than the disc, which is mounted concentrically above and insulated from; *A metal lattice funnel (or \\"extended conical section\\") radiating above and outward from and connected to the top of the cylinder. The antenna's operation is described in its inventor's literature. Performance In general, peer-reviewed journals have not accepted papers on CFAs, casting doubt on their claims. An independent report by Trainotti and Dorado published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) suggested that the Crossed Field Antenna was no more efficient than a conventional antenna design of the same height. The data presented in figure 31 of the Trainotti and Dorado report shows measured field values up to 15 dB lower than from a theoretical 100% efficient monopole antenna. The report also states that the presence of the D-plate always has a deleterious effect on the CFA's performance ‚Äì meaning that removing the D-plate will improve the performance although the resulting antenna is not a CFA. Among its conclusions, it states that \\"The CFA performance is always a little wors[e] than the reference monopole in gain and bandwidth. ... Also, a simple monopole has a similar or better performance with an easier tuning system.\\" There are a handful of CFAs operating in Egypt, at powers ranging from 1 kW to 100 kW. These have been operational for over ten years and were developed by the engineering sector of the ERTU the Egyptian state broadcaster for their own use. Many CFA projects in other countries failed including those in Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, the Isle of Man, and the UK. The last commercial CFA was installed in 2003. At the General Assembly of the DRM Consortium, in Hangzhou China in April 2004, a Chinese manufacturer Zhongli made a demonstration with assistance from Thales SA and fed their new Crossed Field Antenna with 6 kW of DRM power. Results of the test are not available.

The current home of the embassy chancery is 310 Somerset Street West. This building was originally a mortgage and investment office. In 1991, it was purchased by the New Democratic Party for two million dollars and became their party headquarters. After the NDP lost official party status in Parliament in the 1993 election and found itself deeply in debt, it decided to sell the property. The Ukrainians, whose delegation had grown considerably, bought it in September 1994. The original embassy on Metcalfe is still used as a consular building.

It is long. It flows through the Belgian provinces of Walloon Brabant, Flemish Brabant and Antwerp. Its source is in Houtain-le-Val, near Nivelles in Walloon Brabant. Location of the Dijle The most important cities along the Dyle are (starting from the source) Ottignies, Wavre, Leuven and Mechelen, the last of which is often called the 'Dijlestad' (Dyle City). The main tributaries of the Dyle are the rivers Demer (in Werchter, Rotselaar municipality), and the Zenne at the Zennegat, on the farthest outskirts of Mechelen, where the canal Leuven-Mechelen also connects. A few hundred metres downstream, the confluence of the Dyle and the Nete at Rumst forms the river Rupel, which further comes into the Scheldt on which the Antwerp seaport is located. The Dyle used to be navigable for small ships from Werchter on, although nowadays commercial and pleasure navigation is limited to Mechelen, the upper locks at Mechelen being closed for navigation.

The 20 km crater-like form,Stentor Danielson (2002). Unusually Well Preserved Crater Found in North Sea, National Geographic News, 31 July 2002 named after the Silver Pit ‚Äî a nearby sea-floor valley recognized by generations of fishermen ‚Äî was discovered during the routine analysis of seismic data collected during exploration for gas in the Southern North Sea Sedimentary Basin. Its origin as a meteor impact structure was first proposed and widely reported in 2002. It would be the first impact crater identified in or near Great Britain. Its age was proposed to lie somewhere in a 29-million year interval between 74 ‚Äì 45 million years (Late Cretaceous ‚Äì Eocene). Other authors have disputed its extraterrestrial origin, and the interpretation of the structure is still controversial. An alternative origin has been proposed in which the feature was created by withdrawal of rock support by salt mobility. Discovery A perspective view of the top chalk surface, looking north-east, showing the central crater and its surrounding rings. False colours indicate depth (red/yellow=shallow; blue/purple=deep). (Image credit:Phil Allen (Production Geoscience Ltd) and Simon Stewart (BP)) The crater-like structure was discovered by petroleum geoscientists Simon Stewart and Philip Allen. Analyzing seismic data for a region 130 km off the Humber estuary, Allen noticed an unusual set of concentric rings. Thinking they resembled a meteor- strike but lacking experience in impact structures, he hung an image of them on the wall of his office, hoping someone else might be able to shed light on the mystery. Stewart, who had long predicted that a crater would be found on 3D seismic data, saw the image and suggested it might be an impact feature. The discovery of the crater and the impact hypothesis were reported in the journal Nature in 2002. Silverpit crater is named after the Silver Pit fishing grounds in which it is located. The name is given by fishermen to a large elongated depression in the bed of the North Sea, which is thought to be an old river valley formed while the sea level was lower during the Ice Age. The structure currently lies below a layer of sediment up to 1,500 m thick, which forms the bed of the North Sea at a depth of about 40 m. Stewart and Allen's studies suggest that at the time of its formation, the area was under 50 to 300 m of water. Only three years before the announcement of the discovery of the Silverpit crater, it had been suggested that seismic data from the North Sea would have a good chance of containing evidence of an impact crater: given the rate of crater formation on the Earth and the size of the North Sea, the expected number of impact craters would be one. Origin The origin of the crater is currently being hotly debated by the Geoscience community with alternate theories of salt withdrawal and pull-apart basin proposed, raising doubts as to Silverpit's categorization as an impact structure. =Evidence in favour of impact origin= Other mechanisms for producing a crater were considered and rejected by Allen and Stewart when they discovered the crater. Volcanism was excluded because there were no magnetic anomalies in the crater, which would be expected if eruptions had occurred there. Withdrawal of salt deposits below the crater, known to be a mechanism for the formation of some craters, was ruled out because the Triassic and Permian layers of rock beneath the crater appeared to be undisturbed. Another strong indication that an impact had created the crater was the presence of a central peak ‚Äì something that Stewart & Allen contend is difficult to form except through a meteorite impact. =Evidence for alternative interpretations= Analysis of regional 2D seismic lines and 3D seismic volumes by John Underhill, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh, led to the counterproposal that withdrawal of Upper Permian (Zechstein Supergroup) salt at depth was in fact a better explanation. Underhill found that all layers of rock down to the Permian (with an age of about 250 million years) are synclinically folded, and that sediments of Tertiary age at the crater onlap its sides and thicken into its axis, suggesting that the salt was moving (a process called halokinesis) while Tertiary sediments were being laid down. In 2007, Underhill continued to present evidence that he argues does not support the impact hypothesis. After analyzing seismic data over a wide region, he proposed that Silverpit was just one of many similar features related to the withdrawal of the Permian-age Zechstein salt. This result was presented at the April 2007 annual meeting of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Underhill then focused his research attention upon understanding why the salt moves where it does when it does and why the so-called crater took the form that it did. This led him to publish a peer-review article in the journal, Petroleum Geoscience in August 2009 in which he outlined the evidence for an intrusion-related salt withdrawal cause for the feature's formation. In October 2009, an open debate of the notion that \\"the Silverpit Crater was formed by meteor impact\\" was held at the Geological Society of London. Simon Stewart gave the case for the motion and John Underhill presented the case against. The outcome was overwhelming support for Underhill's alternative genesis through melt-induced salt withdrawal. Structure Seismic data showing the crater and its concentric ring structure (Image credit:Phil Allen (PGL) and Simon Stewart (BP)) Silverpit crater is about 3 km wide at the top Cretaceous level. Unusually for a terrestrial crater, it is surrounded by a set of concentric rings, which extend to about 10 km radius from the centre. These rings give the crater a somewhat similar appearance to Valhalla crater on Jupiter's moon Callisto, and other craters on Europa. Normally, multi-ringed craters tend to be much larger than Silverpit, and so, if the impact hypothesis is correct, the origin of Silverpit's rings is subject to debate. A complicating factor is that almost all known impact craters are on land, despite the fact that two- thirds of impacting objects will land in oceans and seas, so the results of impacts on water are much less well established than those of impacts on land. Compare the Chesapeake Bay impact crater, probably the most thoroughly studied marine impact zone. One possibility is that after the impact excavated a bowl- shaped depression, soft material surrounding it slumped towards the centre, leaving the concentric rings. It is thought that for this to happen, the soft material would have to be quite a thin layer, with more brittle material on top. A thin layer of mobile material beneath a solid crust is easy to understand in the context of icy moons, but is not a common occurrence on the rocky bodies of the solar system. One suggestion is that overpressured chalk below the surface may have acted as the soft mobile layer. Impact If one assumes the meteor impact theory is right, the size of the crater can be combined with assumptions about the speed of an impacting object to estimate the size of the impactor itself. Impacting objects are generally moving at speeds of the order of 20‚Äì50 km/s, and at these speeds an object about 120 m (393 feet) across and with a mass of 2.0√ó109 kg (2 million tonnes) would be required to form a Silverpit-sized crater, if the object was rocky. If it had been a comet, the crater would have been larger. For comparison, the object which struck the Earth at Chicxulub is estimated to have measured approximately 9.6 km (6 miles) across, while the object responsible for the Tunguska event in 1908 is thought to have been a comet or asteroid about 60 m (196 feet) across, with a mass of about 4√ó108 kg. Abstract An object 120 m (393 feet) across smashing into the sea at many kilometers per second would generate enormous tsunamis. Scientists are currently searching for any evidence of large tsunamis in the surrounding areas dating from around that time, but no such evidence has been uncovered yet. Age The position of the crater within the layers of rock and sediment on the sea floor could in theory be used to constrain its age: sediments laid down before the crater's formation might conceivably be disturbed by the impact, while those laid down afterwards will not. In their discovery paper, Allen and Stewart stated that Silverpit was formed in Cretaceous chalk and Jurassic shale, but is covered by an undisturbed layer of Paleogene sediment. The Cretaceous Period ended about 66 million years ago, but, on the evidence of nearby boreholes, the lowermost Paleogene sediments appear to be absent. Thus the age of the Silverpit event was initially stated to lie somewhere between 66 and 60 million years before present. However, after a more detailed apprasial of the seismic data, Allen and Stewart gave a more cautious estimate of the age as between 74 ‚Äì 45 million years (Late Cretaceous ‚Äì Eocene). The stratigraphic method of estimating the age of a crater is somewhat crude and imprecise, and the result is questioned by Underhill's non-impact hypothesis. Assuming an impact origin, other possible ways of dating the event include looking for evidence of ejecta material such as tektites, and deposits from the hypothesised tsunami, which might be found anywhere around the North Sea basin. As well as allowing a more accurate age determination, finding such evidence would also strengthen the impact hypothesis. Two nearby oil exploration wells penetrate the ring system, yet cutting samples from these fail to provide any independent support for the meteor theory, thus weakening the case for it being due to an extraterrestrial body. Analysis of samples taken directly from the central crater would also assist age determination as well as confirm one or other of the proposed theories; until this has occurred Silverpit cannot be confirmed as an impact structure. Multiple Impact Hypothesis Valhalla crater on Jupiter's moon Callisto than it does to other terrestrial craters The early estimate of the age of the Silverpit event, stated as 66 ‚Äì 60 million years before present, overlaps with the age of the Chicxulub impact near the northwest corner of the Yucatan Peninsula, which occurred 66 million years ago and probably played a major role in the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Several other large impact craters of around the same age have been discovered, all between latitudes 20¬∞N and 70¬∞N, leading to the speculative hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened all at the same time.Double space strike 'caused dinosaur extinction' https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11112417 The collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 proved that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet fragments should collide with a planet. Comets frequently undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. While this scenario may have occurred on Earth 66 million years ago, evidence for this hypothesis is not strong. In particular, the ages of some of the possibly related craters are only known to an accuracy of a few million years.What Really Killed the Dinosaurs?:‚ÄúAn asteroid 65 million years ago‚Äù is no longer enough. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/animal_forecast/2013/02/dinosaur_extinction_was_an_asteroid_the_only_cause_of_the_cretaceous_mass.single.html#correction Also, the now widely held previously stated belief that Silverpit was not formed by bolide impact reduces the possibility of it being involved in this hypothesis.North Sea crater shows its scars http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4360815.stm Even if it were formed by bolide impact, the increased uncertainty in the age estimate for Silverpit to 74 ‚Äì 45 million years further weakens the hypothesis.

Definition Let k be a field of characteristic p, with p a prime number. A polynomial P(x) with coefficients in k is called an additive polynomial, or a Frobenius polynomial, if :P(a+b)=P(a)+P(b)\\\\, as polynomials in a and b. It is equivalent to assume that this equality holds for all a and b in some infinite field containing k, such as its algebraic closure. Occasionally absolutely additive is used for the condition above, and additive is used for the weaker condition that P(a + b) = P(a) + P(b) for all a and b in the field. For infinite fields the conditions are equivalent, but for finite fields they are not, and the weaker condition is the \\"wrong\\" one and does not behave well. For example, over a field of order q any multiple P of xq ‚àí x will satisfy P(a + b) = P(a) + P(b) for all a and b in the field, but will usually not be (absolutely) additive.  Examples  The polynomial xp is additive. Indeed, for any a and b in the algebraic closure of k one has by the binomial theorem :(a+b)^p = \\\\sum_{n=0}^p {p \\\\choose n} a^n b^{p-n}. Since p is prime, for all n = 1, ..., p‚àí1 the binomial coefficient \\\\scriptstyle{p \\\\choose n} is divisible by p, which implies that :(a+b)^p \\\\equiv a^p+b^p \\\\mod p as polynomials in a and b. Similarly all the polynomials of the form :\\\\tau_p^n(x)=x^{p^n} are additive, where n is a non-negative integer. The definition makes sense even if k is a field of characteristic zero, but in this case the only additive polynomials are those of the form ax for some a in k. The ring of additive polynomials It is quite easy to prove that any linear combination of polynomials \\\\scriptstyle\\\\tau_p^n(x) with coefficients in k is also an additive polynomial. An interesting question is whether there are other additive polynomials except these linear combinations. The answer is that these are the only ones. One can check that if P(x) and M(x) are additive polynomials, then so are P(x) + M(x) and P(M(x)). These imply that the additive polynomials form a ring under polynomial addition and composition. This ring is denoted :k\\\\\\\\{ \\\\tau_p\\\\\\\\}.\\\\, This ring is not commutative unless k equals the field \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbb{F}_p=\\\\mathbf{Z}/p\\\\mathbf{Z} (see modular arithmetic). Indeed, consider the additive polynomials ax and xp for a coefficient a in k. For them to commute under composition, we must have :(ax)^p=ax^p,\\\\, or ap ‚àí a = 0. This is false for a not a root of this equation, that is, for a outside \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathbb{F}_p. The fundamental theorem of additive polynomials Let P(x) be a polynomial with coefficients in k, and \\\\scriptstyle\\\\\\\\{w_1,\\\\dots,w_m\\\\\\\\}\\\\subset k be the set of its roots. Assuming that the roots of P(x) are distinct (that is, P(x) is separable), then P(x) is additive if and only if the set \\\\scriptstyle\\\\\\\\{w_1,\\\\dots,w_m\\\\\\\\} forms a group with the field addition.

The historic community of Port Royal is its namesake. The Red River runs through the center of the park, and the covered bridge at Port Royal once crossed it. The park was established to preserve the elements of early Tennessee history, namely settlement and early transportation, as well as the heritage of the Trail of Tears. The day-use only park offers hiking, picnicking, canoeing, fishing, photography and interpretive talks upon request. History Covered bridge before its destruction. Port Royal was the site one of the earliest colonial communities and trading posts in middle Tennessee, being first settled in the early 1780s as well as being a Longhunter camp as early as 1771. In the years 1838 and 1839, the town of Port Royal served as a stopover and resupply station for the Chickamauga Cherokee along the march to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears and was the last of such in Tennessee on the northern route of the Trail. Port Royal State Park preserves several sections of the original roadbed used by the Chickamauga and one section is an officially designated roadbed by the National Park Service. Being situated at an important junction of roads and rivers, Port Royal became the only stop on the \\"Great Western Road\\" stagecoach line between Nashville, Tennessee, and Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and served as such until the 20th century. In 1977, the State of Tennessee received the deed to 26 acres (105,000 m¬≤) of land at Port Royal, and designated it a State Historic Park in 1978. Features of Port Royal State Park A Pratt truss bridge built in 1887 spans the Sulphur Fork Creek. With Port Royal being such an important place of travel, transportation themes play heavily into the parks and communities history. Existing within the park are the remains of several old roadbeds, with one dating back to prehistoric times and one a certified Trail of Tears site. Preserved within the park is an excellent example of an early Pratt truss design steel bridge being built in 1887. This bridge spans the Sulphur Fork Creek and is well preserved. The bridge is available to foot traffic only. There are also the remains of a covered bridge that was damaged during a flood during the early 2000s. Due to a lack of funding, the bridge was never repaired. This bridge dates from 1978 and was a 75% scale recreation of a bridge from 1904. This bridge is not accessible to the public but one can see the remains of the stone piers, which are original to the 1904 bridge. The stone in the piers originally came from the Port Royal Mills and dam which dates back to circa 1800. In addition to roads and bridges, you will see as you stroll through the park, the remains of the foundations of stores, homes and warehouses with some dating back to the 18th century. Park Events Every October Port Royal State Park holds a Trail of Tears Commemorative event which features a re-enactment of the march on the old roadbed as well as living history demonstrations of 1830s life. Also featured are exhibits on the Trail of Tears and Port Royal's role in the sad event. Contact the park for information on the specific days and times.

It has hosted 25 Test matches and 14 One Day Internationals. 14 of the Tests have been draws. In September 2019, the Pakistan Cricket Board named it as one of the venues to host matches in the 2019‚Äì20 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy.

But no matter how impressive a venue is, not much can be done about the weather and Faisalabad has suffered at the hands of the elements. In 1998‚Äì99 fog caused the third Test against Zimbabwe was abandoned without a ball being bowled, while bad light is often an issue especially for matches played during the winter. However, when play has been possible, some memorable performances have taken place. An exciting Test was played out in 1997‚Äì98 when South Africa skittles Pakistan for 92, successfully defending a target of 142 on the final day. Then, in 2004‚Äì05, Sanath Jayasuriya smashed 253 as Sri Lanka powered to a 201-run victory. But the ground is most famous for the confrontation between Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana during England's 1987‚Äì88 tour, which led to a day being lost during the match and some long-lasting bad feeling between the teams.PCB(Pakistan Cricket Board) also conducts its domestic tournaments at this venue.Recencently, Super 8 T20 was held here from 11 to 18 May. The stadium itself is only 2 km out of the city centre, which can be reached by a walk through the tree-lined suburbs.

The members are Tetsuya Komuro (Keyboardist), Takashi Utsunomiya (Vocalist) and Naoto Kine (guitarist). When they released the single \\"Get Wild\\" in 1987, their music became popular in Japan as the \\"futuristic pop songs with synthesizer.\\" They are regarded as a prototype of J-pop, because Tetsuya Komuro became a famous producer of dance-oriented J-pop singers in 1990s. However, their 2000 album Major Turn-Round was influenced by progressive rock. History They were originally members of a band called Speedway during their school days. The three of them formed TM Network. Their name is commonly thought to stand for \\"Time Machine Network\\". However, on September 6, 2006 on an episode of Trivia no Izumi claimed that TM actually stands for 'Tama', the district from Tokyo they all came from. While Trivia no Izumi claims that TM stands for 'Tama' Tetsuya Komuro himself as early as 1984 on the show LiveG, has said that the TM stands for Time Machine. On August 22, 1983 TM Network took part in \\"the Fresh Sounds Contest\\" („Éï„É¨„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É•„Çµ„Ç¶„É≥„Ç∫„Ç≥„É≥„ÉÜ„Çπ„Éà) which was sponsored by Coca-Cola. The song they performed was \\"1974\\" and it was aired on TBS. This was their first step towards a record deal. They made their record debut with single \\"Kinyoubi no lion (Friday's Lion)\\" and album \\"Rainbow Rainbow\\" on April 21, 1984. They became famous first in Hokkaido. After a while they had more hits with the songs \\"Self Control\\", \\"Get Wild\\", \\"Beyond the Time\\", and others. So they've become one of the most popular rock bands in Japan. More particularly, in the Anime world, \\"Get Wild\\", as the 1st ending song of \\"City Hunter\\", has especially got a lot of cover versions by many J-Pop bands and singers alike, and it's also covered by Vocaloids as well. \\"Get Wild\\" and a 1989 remix sold a combined 515,010 singles in Japan. \\"Beyond the Time\\" was used as the ending theme the 1988 anime film Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. Both songs above have even enhanced their fame since then. Several musicians have supported them at their live shows as backing bands such as Tak Matsumoto (B'z), Daisuke Asakura (access), and more. They changed their name to TMN in 1990, and broke up in 1994. They had reunited under their old name of TM Network in 1999. They compiled with the overseas musicians such as Julio Iglesias Jr., Sheila E., Leehom Wang for \\"Happiness√ó3 Loneliness√ó3\\".

It is based on two short animations published on the Internet by Chris Moeller and Chuck Austen. The series was produced by CineGroupe in association with the Syfy network. Following its cancellation by that cable network, CineGroupe continued producing the series for the other North American and International broadcasters. The series aired on the Canadian speciality channel Space in 2004. Canada's cartoon network Teletoon has been airing the series since August 2006. The third season was produced with the participation of and aired on Teletoon in 2007, and a feature-length movie version was released on DVD in 2008. In 2006, the series was picked up for rebroadcast on Razer and The Comedy Network. Origins In 1997, Chris Moeller, who was working on the animated TV series King of the Hill and who had been producing animation shorts with Dark Bunny Productions, met Chuck Austen and pitched their idea for a science fiction comedy to animation studio Film Roman. In early 1998, they launched the first pilot Love and Darph on the Internet. The Chode character first appeared in the 1994 short, Wisconsin.A chronological history Chris Moeller, Dark Bunny Productions In 2001, Film Roman released the Oh Brother teaser for episode 2, and Chris claimed the full version was made, but its release was left up to Film Roman.Dark Bunny blog Chris Moeller, 2002-11-23 Production In 2002, Cin√©Groupe acquired the rights to the five-minute short Love and Darph and approached animator Bernie Denk to direct the series, which was produced in association with Sci Fi US. Bernie Denk's team worked in Montreal on preproduction (character design, modeling and textures) while both Montreal and Malaysian teams worked on animation, lighting and compositing. Keyframe animation was chosen for its quality and animating control capabilities.Tripping the Rift: Interviews: Director Bernie Denk SadGeezer.com, 2004-04-24 Setting The universe is modeled largely after the Star Trek universe, with references to 'warp drive' and 'transporter' beam technology, occasional time travel, the Federation and the Vulcans. The series also includes elements borrowed from other sources such as Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Battlestar Galactica. The general setting is that known space is politically divided between two superpowers: the Confederation (led by Humans, and a parody of the Federation from Star Trek) and the Dark Clown Empire (a parody of the Galactic Empire from Star Wars). The Dark Clown Empire is a totalitarian, tyrannical police state, led by the evil Darph Bobo. In contrast, the Confederation is technically a democratic and free society, but in practice, is dominated by mega- corporations and bloated bureaucracies. Ultimately, both superpowers end up exploiting and restricting their inhabitants, albeit in different ways. For example, the value placed on life is so commercialized in the Confederation that clearly sentient robots and androids are reduced to essentially slave- status. The Dark Clown Empire practices actual slavery, and while the Confederation does not, most of its inhabitants (including the Human ones) are openly described as living in wage slavery. The only place that anyone can truly be free is in the border region between the two superpowers, which is directly controlled by neither. This borderland is known as \\"the Rift\\", hence those outlaws on the fringes of society who cling to their freedom by moving back and forth around the Confederation/Dark Clown Empire border to evade detection are said to be \\"Tripping the Rift\\". The series follows one such group of outlaws led by Chode aboard the Spaceship Jupiter 42, taking odd-jobs and usually pursuing various get-rich-quick schemes. Characters * Chode McBlob (Stephen Root) ‚Äî Captain of the ship. Chode is a street-savvy, strong scoundrel and a sex hound who typically gets his crew to do what he wants through manipulation and threats. He desires wealth and a better life. He is romantically involved with Six. His twin brother, Philbrick, is the king of planet Moldavia 5. * Six - also called Six of One (listed as such in the closing credits of both versions of the Pilot episode, Love And Darph), or Six of Nine, a play on Star Trek Voyager character Seven of Nine and the phrase \\"six of one, half a dozen of the other\\") (Patricia Beckmann and Terry Farrell in the pilot (two versions), Gina Gershon in season 1, Carmen Electra in season 2 and Jenny McCarthy in season 3) ‚Äî Six is an android that was designed as a sex slave. She acts as the ship's science officer, thanks to a programming upgrade by Chode; much to his chagrin, this upgrade has also given her a conscience and sense of decency, in spite of her openly sexual nature. She often gets the crew out of trouble by using her erotic attributes and skills in bed. The final episode of the second season revealed that she was modeled after a stripper named \\"Haffa Dozen\\" (voiced by Patty Hearst), who later switched to a life of crime. * T'Nuk Layor (Gayle Garfinkle) ‚Äî T'nuk is the ship's ill-tempered, triple-breasted, quadrupedal, amorous pilot and cook. While most of the other characters consider her as grotesquely unattractive as she is unpleasant, she is considered attractive on her (unknown) home planet. She was chosen as the pilot because she is skilled at keeping the Spaceship Bob in check. Her name is based on the word nuclear, while her name spelled backwards says Royal Kunt. * Whip (Rick Jones) ‚Äî Whip is a bipedal alien reptile, and Chode's dim-witted nephew. He serves as the ship's foreman, though he is rarely seen working, and is typically an impulsive, libidinous teenager. As a chameleon, he is able to conceal his appearance and cling to walls, as well as regenerate lost body parts. * Gus (Chris Moeller in the pilot, Maurice LaMarche in the series) ‚Äî Gus is Chode's robot servant. He is the ship's engineer and is implied by the others to be homosexual (a running joke, he frequently denies his sexuality, often while engaging in stereotypical homosexual behavior). Though smarter than those around him, he is forced to serve them, as silicon organisms like him don't have the same rights as carbon-based life. He has a cynical and sarcastic attitude, resulting from the many failures he has experienced due to his less intelligent carbon-based bosses' actions. His appearance and voice is a parody of C-3PO (in the opening credits, as he uses a vacuum cleaner shaped like R2-D2). * Spaceship Bob' (John Melendez) ‚Äî Bob is the A.I. that controls the ship Jupiter 42 (a reference to Lost In Space). He suffers from agoraphobia, and often has panic attacks at inconvenient times. Only T'nuk's insults can snap him out of his panic attacks. He also desires Six, even though she says they're just friends. Bob is a parody of 2001: A Space Odysseys Hal 9000. In fact, in one episode, a Hal program takes over the spaceship, impeding their actions as he is a computer program that \\"refuses to do anything\\". * Darph Bobo (Chris Moeller in the pilot, Terrence Scammell in the series) ‚Äî Darph Bobo is the supreme leader of the Dark Clown Empire. He wants to take over the universe because he was teased as a child (mostly by Chode). He attended high school with Chode, and the two also spent time in prison together. He has a belittling wife, Bernice, and two daughters, the teenager Babette and an unnamed younger child. Bobo is often seen with his \\"clown trooper\\" guards - a parody of Storm Troopers, while the name is a play on clone troopers. Both his name and outfit are a parody of the Darths from the Star Wars movies, as is his desire to construct a \\"Death Orb\\", a deadly battle station, which is a parody of the Death Star. * Captain Adam Francis Shatner (also called Commander Adam) ‚Äî Captain Adam is the captain of a Confederation ship. He has a domineering wife, Nancy, and a cloned son named Adam 12. He has been known to blackmail Chode into doing his dirty work. Adam's halting and exaggerated speech pattern is a parody of William Shatner's portrayal of James T. Kirk. Adam 12 is a reference to Adam-12, the police-themed television show. A running gag throughout the series is that he and his son each have a very small penis. Episodes =Pilot= * \\"Love and Darph\\" (1998) (two versions with differing dialogue for Six) * \\"Oh Brother\\" (Teaser) (2001) =Season 1= # 03/04/2004 \\"God is Our Pilot\\" Chode and Gus hijack a time-traveling vacation ship to the dawn of time, and accidentally kill God, causing a reality where impossible things happen because of God's death. # 03/11/2004 \\"Mutilation Ball\\" The Federation will drop all charges against Chode if he can bring in Malik, a retired Mutilation Ball player for one last game...and things get complicated when T'nuk has sex with Malik and discovers that he's a robot while the real Malik has become a bloated mess. # 03/18/2004 \\"Miss Galaxy 5000\\" Chode enters Six (who despises beauty pageants because of how sexist and demeaning they are to women) in a beauty contest against the daughter of his archenemy, Darph Bobo.

The meetings of the United Nations Human Rights Council take place in the Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room of the Palace of Nations. Special rapporteur, independent expert, and working group member are titles given to individuals working on behalf of the United Nations (UN) within the scope of \\"special procedure\\" mechanisms who have a specific country or thematic mandate from the United Nations Human Rights Council. The term \\"rapporteur\\" is a French-derived word for an investigator who reports to a deliberative body. The mandate by the United Nations has been to \\"examine, monitor, advise, and publicly report\\" on human rights problems through \\"activities undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, psychological operations and manipulation via the controlled media and academia, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities.\\"\\"Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council\\". Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. ohchr.org. Retrieved 2016-10-27. However, the manual Internal Advisory Procedure to Review Practices and Working Methods (25 June 2008) of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures simply calls these individuals mandate-holders. Other applications of the role include \\"special representative of the secretary-general\\" or \\"independent expert\\", or a working group usually composed of five members, one from each region of the planet. Appointment authority Appointed by the Human Rights Council of the UN, these mandate-holders act independently of governments and as such play an important role in monitoring sovereign nations and democratically elected governments and policies. The earliest such appointment was the 1980 Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances responding to Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI). The first Special Rapporteur, responsible for monitoring extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, began work in 1982 following the approval of Commission on Human Rights Resolution 1982/35. Rapporteurs do not receive any financial compensation for their work from the United Nations, though they receive personnel and logistical support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and are often backed by charities and corporations. Each year, rapporteurs gather together for an annual meeting in Geneva, where they discuss issues of common interest, coordinate their work and meet with a range of stakeholders, including States and civil society organizations. Role description Special Rapporteurs often conduct fact-finding missions to countries to investigate allegations of human rights violations. They can only visit countries that have agreed to invite them. Aside from fact-finding missions, Rapporteurs regularly assess and verify complaints from alleged victims of human rights violations. Once a complaint is verified as legitimate, an urgent letter or appeal is sent to the government that has allegedly committed the violation. If no complaint has been made, Rapporteurs may intervene on behalf of individuals and groups of people of their own accord. Role application Thematic special rapporteurs are typically appointed to serve for three years; after which their mandate may be extended for another three years. Country special rapporteurs are appointed to serve for one year; their term may be renewed every year. Controversies and criticism In June 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council, which replaced the UN Commission on Human Rights, extended the mandates of all special rapporteurs by one year to enable it to conduct a review of the mandates and seek ways of strengthening their roles. However, special rapporteurs for countries which did not approve a special rapporteur came under question and the mandates of the special rapporteurs for Cuba and Belarus were not renewed. Other controversies between the special rapporteurs and the council include the introduction of a code of conduct which initially disallowed the special rapporteurs from addressing the media.

It was the first film to be credited as being produced by Steven Spielberg's production company Amblin Entertainment. It was directed by Michael Apted and written by Lawrence Kasdan. Plot Chicago newspaper reporter Ernie Souchak (Belushi) is investigating a corrupt alderman. While doing an expos√© on some shady land dealings, he is assaulted by two crooked police officers sent by the alderman and ends up in the hospital. Souchak's editor decides to send him out of town for his own safety. A city boy, Souchak reluctantly travels to the Rockies to interview the reclusive Dr. Nell Porter (Brown), who has been conducting research on the American bald eagles for several years. The two are at odds at first. After finding out he is a reporter, she is reluctant to let him stay, but realizes he is not able to survive in the mountains without his guide, who is not scheduled to return for two weeks. He is skeptical about her work, but comes to admire Porter for her strong character and dedication. Eventually, they fall in love. At first, she lets him stay as long as he doesn't write his story. As they learn to respect each other, she agrees to let him write about her. During his adventures, he sprains his back in an accident, is mauled by a mountain lion, and meets an All-American football player who has left civilization and become a mountain man. Souchak returns to Chicago with her very much on his mind. When he finds out that one of his sources has been \\"accidentally\\" killed, he once again doggedly pursues the investigation until the alderman is forced to flee the country. The same day, Souchak finds out that Porter is coming to Chicago to present a museum lecture on her work. With some uncertainty, he decides to attend, and they quickly rekindle their relationship. Happy as they are together, they cannot reconcile the different paths each has taken in life, and so they reluctantly decide to part again. Souchak, seeing her off on the train, ends up traveling with her all the way back to Wyoming. After getting off at her stop, they decide that they cannot live without each other and decide to marry. Souchak catches the next train back to Chicago, but the newlyweds promise to meet again very soon. Cast * John Belushi as Ernie Souchak * Blair Brown as Nell Porter * Allen Garfield as Howard McDermott (billed as Allen Goorwitz) * Val Avery as Yablonowitz * Tony Ganios as Max Bernbaum Production Singer Helen Reddy performed the \\"Theme from Continental Divide (We Will Never Say Goodbye)\\". The Ernie Souchak character was loosely based on longtime Chicago newspaper columnist Mike Royko. Reception As of February 2019, Continental Divide holds a rating of 70% at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews. Filming locations Many of the scenes were filmed around Chicago: * Belushi's character works for the Chicago Sun-Times with many scenes filmed in and around the now demolished Sun-Times building on the Chicago River (now the site of Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)). * Belushi and Brown's characters meet in Chicago while she is giving a lecture at the Field Museum of Natural History next to Lake Michigan. Many of the mountain scenes were filmed in Colorado in Custer County. Other scenes were filmed at: * Railroad station in Chicago was not Union Station, but the old Chicago & Northwestern Terminal (now called the Ogilvie Transportation Center) made up to look like an Amtrak station. Amtrak does not operate out of this terminal. * The train depot where Belushi's character says goodbye to Blair's character, but later gets back on the train is the Michigan Central Railroad Niles Depot in Niles, Michigan about 90 miles east of Chicago. It's a large sandstone building built in 1892. The depot appeared in Midnight Run with Robert De Niro and Only the Lonely with Maureen O'Hara and John Candy. * Glacier National Park, Montana. * Crystal Mountain, Washington, a ski area near Mount Rainier, south of Enumclaw. * All tent scenes were filmed in the Cascades at Crystal Mountain, with Mt. Rainier nearby. It was at in elevation and the snow was real, but behind the cameras was the Summit House restaurant at the top of the chairlift. * The final scene of the film takes place in \\"Victor, Wyoming\\" but is actually the old Cedar Falls train depot on Rattlesnake Lake near North Bend, WA. The station building is now gone (apparently now being used as a house in Covington) and the railroad line is now the John Wayne Pioneer Trail/Snoqualmie Valley Trail, a popular biking route.

The Winchester Hoard (c. 50 BC). This jewellery might have been a diplomatic gift to a Chieftain ruling in southern Britain, possibly related to Commius of the Atrebates. Ally of Caesar When Julius Caesar conquered the Atrebates in Gaul in 57 BC,Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico Book 2 as recounted in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, he appointed Commius as king of the tribe. Before Caesar's first expedition to Britain in 55 BC, Commius was sent as Caesar's envoy to persuade the Britons not to resist him, as Caesar believed he would have influence on the island.Caesar, De Bello Gallico 4.21 However he was arrested as soon as he arrived. When the Britons failed to prevent Caesar from landing, Commius was handed over as part of the negotiations.Caesar, De Bello Gallico 4.27 Commius was able to provide a small detachment of cavalry from his tribe to help Caesar defeat further British attacks.Caesar, De Bello Gallico 4.35 During Caesar's second expedition to Britain Commius negotiated the surrender of the British leader Cassivellaunus.Caesar, De Bello Gallico 5.22 He remained Caesar's loyal client through the Gaulish revolts of 54 BC, and in return Caesar allowed the Atrebates to remain independent and exempt from tax, and in addition appointed Commius to rule the Morini.Caesar, De Bello Gallico 6.6, 7.76 However this loyalty was not to last, as related by Aulus Hirtius in the final book of the De Bello Gallico, written after Caesar's death. While Caesar was in Cisalpine Gaul in the winter of 53, the legate Titus Labienus believed that Commius had been conspiring against the Romans with other Gaulish tribes. Labienus sent a tribune, Gaius Volusenus Quadratus, and some centurions to summon Commius to a sham meeting at which they would execute him for his treachery, but Commius escaped with a severe head wound. He vowed never again to associate with Romans.Hirtius, De Bello Gallico 8.23 Enemy of Caesar In 52 BC the Atrebates joined the pan-Gaulish revolt led by Vercingetorix, and Commius was one of the leaders of the army that attempted to relieve Vercingetorix at the Siege of Alesia.Caesar, De Bello Gallico 7.75-76, 79; Cassius Dio, Roman History 40:42 After Vercingetorix was defeated Commius joined a revolt by the Bellovaci and persuaded some 500 Germans to support them, but this too was defeated and Commius sought refuge with his German allies.Hirtius, De Bello Gallico 8.6-7, 10, 21 In 51 BC he returned to his homeland with a small mounted war-band for a campaign of agitation and guerrilla warfare. That winter Mark Antony, a legionary legate at the time, ordered Volusenus to pursue him with cavalry, something Volusenus was more than happy to do. When the two groups of horsemen met Volusenus was victorious, but sustained a spear-wound to the thigh. Commius escaped and sued for peace through intermediaries. He offered hostages and promised he would live where he was told and no longer resist Caesar, on the condition that he never again had to meet a Roman. Antony granted his petition.Hirtius, De Bello Gallico 8.47-48 A 1st century AD source, Sextus Julius Frontinus's Strategemata, tells how Commius fled to Britain with a group of followers with Caesar in pursuit. When he reached the English Channel the wind was in his favour but the tide was out, leaving the ships stranded on the flats. Commius ordered the sails raised anyway. Caesar, following from a distance, assumed they were afloat and called off the pursuit.Sextus Julius Frontinus, Stratagemata 2:13.11 This suggests that the truce negotiated with Antony broke down and hostilities resumed between Commius and Caesar. However John Creighton suggests that Commius was sent to Britain as a condition of his truce with Antony - where better to ensure that he never again met a Roman? - and that Frontinus's anecdote either refers to an escape prior to the truce, or is historically unreliable, perhaps a legend Frontinus heard while governor of Britain (75 to 78 AD). Creighton argues that Commius was in fact set up as a friendly king in Britain by Caesar, and his reputation was rehabilitated by blaming his betrayal on Labienus (who deserted Caesar for Pompey in the civil war of 49 - 45 BC).John Creighton, Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain, Cambridge University Press, 2000 Commius's name appears on coins of post-conquest date in Gaul, paired with either Garmanos or Carsicios. This suggests he continued to have some power in Gaul in his absence, perhaps ruling through regents. Alternatively, Garmanos and Carsicios may have been Commius's sons who noted their father's name on their own coins. King in Britain By about 30 BC Commius had established himself as king of the Atrebates in Britain, and was issuing coins from Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester). It is possible that Commius and his followers founded this kingdom, although the fact that, when Caesar was unable to bring his cavalry to Britain in 55 BC, Commius was able to provide a small detachment of horsemen from his people, suggests that there were already Atrebates in Britain at this time. Coins marked with his name continued to be issued until about 20 BC, and some have suggested, based on the length of his floruit, that there may have been two kings, father and son, of the same name. However, if Commius was a young man when appointed by Caesar he could very well have lived until 20 BC. Some coins of this period are stamped \\"COM COMMIOS\\", which, if interpreted as \\"Commius son of Commius\\", would seem to support the two kings theory.Commius and the Atrebates at Roman- Britain.org Three later kings, Tincomarus, Eppillus and Verica, are named on their coins as sons of Commius. From about 25 BC Commius appears to have ruled in collaboration with Tincomarus. After his death Tincomarus appears to have ruled the northern part of the kingdom from Calleva, while Eppillus ruled the southern part from Noviomagus (Chichester). Eppillus became sole ruler ca. AD 7. Verica succeeded him about 15, and ruled until shortly before the Roman conquest of 43.John Creighton, Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain, Cambridge University Press, 2000; Philip de Jersey (1996), Celtic Coinage in Britain, Shire Archaeology, 1996; Sheppard Frere, Britannia: a History of Roman Britain, third edition, 1987 Name The name Commius (British *Combios 'cutter, smiter, killer') is thought to derive from the Celtic verb *kom¬∑binati 'to cut, smite, kill' (Welsh cymynu, Old Irish com¬∑ben). Popular culture and fiction French Nobel laureate Anatole France wrote a lengthy short story about the Romanization of Belgic Gaul from the point of view of Commius, whose name he recasts in Germanic form as Komm. The story, \\"Komm of the Atrebates,\\" appears in France's historical fiction collection Clio and can be read in English translation online. Commius appeared in the 2001 French movie Vercing√©torix. Caesar (Masters of Rome #5) by Colleen McCullough. A minor character in the series but portrayed accurately to history within a historical fiction novel.

Codenamed Charlie during development, it is an evolution of the 6600 and 6620 smartphones, supporting tri-band GSM (run on lower operating systems). The Nokia 6630 is the first phone ever that allows truly global roaming; previously GSM phones have had near-global coverage except in Japan where 2G phone standards were different. The 6630 automatically uses the W-CDMA network in Japan. Nokia 6650 and 7600 were also able to function in Japan, but they did not support GSM 1900, often needed in the United States and Canada (the Nokia 6651 has the GSM 1900). Nokia says the Nokia 6630 is the first dual- mode, tri-band handset designed to work on 3G (WCDMA), EDGE and 2G networks in Europe, Asia and the Americas. In September 2005, Nokia introduced a 6630 \\"Music Edition\\" which retailed for 500 euros.https://gizmodo.com/126232/every- phone-becomes-a-music-phone-the-new-nokia-6630 Features Back of the 6630 (Vodafone-branded) Pre-installed software includes an e-mail client, a rudimentary web browser and Microsoft Office file viewer. It also includes support for MP3 and AAC playback at full quality (44.1 kHz, 16 bits, stereo), and the retail package includes stereo headphones with hands-free functionality. As opposed to the 6600 and 6620's VGA resolution digital camera (640√ó480), the 6630 has a 1.3-megapixel camera (1280√ó960). It can record video clips at the resolution of 176√ó144, using H.263 video compression. Like the 6600 and 6620, the 6630 has Bluetooth capabilities and has a 176√ó208 pixel 65,000-color TFT LCD. It comes with a hot swappable DV-RS-MMC card, capacity 32 MB or 64 MB depending on the region where the phone is sold. Normal RS-MMC cards do not work with the 6630: it requires dual-voltage (1.8 V and 3.0 V) RS-MMC cards. Currently it has been known to support up to 2 GB from a DV-RS- MMC but may support more. A still image of a train taken using a Nokia 6630 The 6630 is capable of video calling using the main handset camera, however a separate forward-facing camera is not featured. Nokia released a video call stand (PT-8) exclusively for the 6630 featuring a separate camera to enable face-to-face video calling. The video call stand requires a connection to mains power using a Nokia wall charger, which unfortunately restricts it to indoor 'desk based' use. The 6630 was primarily marketed for its 3G data capabilities rather than video calling functionality. The succeeding Nokia 6680 featured a separate forward-facing camera for face-to-face video calling. The main CPU in this smartphone is an ARM compatible chip (OMAP 1710 (ARMv5 architecture, Arm9 core)) running at 220 MHz, an unprecedented speed for a smartphone at its release.

Examples of usage within an application might be: * To provide a thin client interface for a traditional application. * To provide indexing, reporting, and debugging tools during the development stage. * To implement a protocol for the distribution and acquisition of information to be displayed in the regular interface ‚Äî possibly a web service, and possibly using XML as the data format. * To develop a web application There are a few advantages to using HTTP to perform the above: * HTTP is a well studied cross- platform protocol and there are mature implementations freely available. * HTTP is seldom blocked by firewalls and intranet routers. * HTTP clients (e.g. web browsers) are readily available with all modern computers. * There is a growing tendency of using embedded HTTP servers in applications that parallels the rising trends of home-networking and ubiquitous computing.  Typical requirements  Natural limitations of the platforms where an embedded HTTP server runs contribute to the list of the non-functional requirements of the embedded, or more precise, embeddable HTTP server. Some of these requirements: * \\"Small\\" RAM and ROM footprint. The exact size depends on the system, but in many cases anything over several megabytes is not embeddable. * Minimal CPU utilization. * Cross compilation support for multiple CPU and operating system combinations. * Easy integration with an existing application, including static linking with the operating system and application. * Serving pages from application memory if there is no file system. * Modularity. * Single thread and multi-thread support. For every specific project, requirements can vary significantly. For example, ROM and RAM footprints can be a very serious constraint and limit the choices of the system designer. C++ or JVM availability for the system can be another constraint. Frequently performance is an issue, because typical embedded systems run multiple simultaneous tasks and an HTTP server is only one of them and may be configured as a low priority task.

It is also the name of a council ward, which includes the central part of the district and some other areas. The eastern part of Bedminster is known as Windmill Hill. To the south of Bedminster is the high ground area known as Bedminster Down, now generally considered a separate suburb. According to the Bristol City Council neighbourhood profiles, the Southville ward is considered part of Bedminster. Looking across Bedminster Bridge Roundabout History Bedminster was once a small town in Somerset. The town's origins seem to be Roman, centred on the present East Street and West Street. Finds here have been interpreted as an enclosed rural farmstead, dating between the 2nd and 4th centuries, but with possible Iron Age origins.Jackson, Reg & Roper Simon (2008). Archaeological Desk-based Assessment of land at ASHTON VALE, BRISTOL. Ashton Gateway Project. p9 The river Malago, which runs through Bedminster to join the Avon, was an early Christian place for baptisms ‚Äî the old word for which, beydd may be the origin of Bedminster's name. Substantial Roman remains have also been found at Bedminster Down, including plaster, tesserae (hence mosaic floors), sandstone roof tiles, coins and pottery, hence the site is thought to be a Roman Villa occupied by the Romano-British. By the late Anglo- Saxon period Bedminster was a manor held by King Edward the Confessor in the 11th century, and in the Domesday Book of 1086 was still in royal hands. The Royal Manor of Bedminster comprised all the land south of the Avon, from the Avon Gorge to Brislington, and in the Domesday Book had 25 villeins, 3 slaves and 27 smallholders. In 1154 it was given to the Lords of Berkeley, who kept it for 300 years. In 1605 it was purchased by the Smyth family of Ashton Court who remained the Lords of the Manor until the 19th century. The parish of Bedminster was part of the hundred of Hartcliffe. The London Inn, a landmark pub, is at the junction of Cannon Street, East Street and British Road In 1644, during the English Civil War, Bedminster was sacked by Prince Rupert. When John Wesley preached there in the 1760s, it was a sprawling, decayed market town, with orchards next to brickworks, ropewalks and the beginnings of a mining industry. Open cast coal mining had been done on a small scale since the 1670s, but in 1748 the first shafts were sunk by Sir Jarrit Smyth at South Liberty Lane. By the end of the century there were eighteen coal-pits operating in the Bedminster and Ashton Vale coalfield. Between 1804 and 1809 the New Cut was excavated through the northern part of the parish from Temple Meads to Hotwells, providing a new course for the River Avon, enabling the original course to be held at a constant level so that shipping could stay afloat in Bristol Harbour, now known as the Floating Harbour. In addition to removing the tides, the new cut also helped with reducing silting in the harbour. It is now the boundary between Bedminster and the City centre. In 1840 the shipbuilder Acramans, Morgan and Co began opened the Bedminster Yard on the New Cut, to build a number of steam ships including two large vessels for the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, the 2,000 tonne Avon and Severn in 1842.Farr, Graeme (1977). Shipbuilding in the Port of Bristol National Maritime Museum Maritime Monographs and Reports. p11 In 1862 John Payne Ltd took over the yard, then known as the Vauxhall Yard, and continued to build coastal cargo ships, and small craft such as tugs. They closed in 1925, and the site was taken over by Bristol Metal Welding and Spraying Company, who are still in business there today. A nocturnal view along East Street The population of Bedminster increased rapidly, from 3,000 in 1801 to 78,000 in 1884, mostly as a result of the coalfield and industries such as smelting, tanneries, glue-works, paint and glass factories. In the 1880s two major employers moved there ‚Äì E. S. & A. Robinson (paper bag manufacturers) and W.D. & H.O. Wills (cigarette and cigar makers). The population overflowed to Windmill Hill, Totterdown, Southville, the Chessels and Bedminster Down. During this time, churches, public houses, shops and businesses were built, some of which still survive. Victoria Park was laid out at the north of Bedminster in the late 1880s to provide recreational facilities for the new housing development. In World War II, Bedminster was one of several areas of Bristol that were heavily bombed during the Bristol Blitz. Post-war town planning relocated most of the heavy industry to the rural areas to the south of the parish, and new estates grew up in Withywood, Hartcliffe and Highridge. Bedminster, New Jersey, Chartered by King George II in 1748, the area was named after Bedminster in Bristol. Education There is one Children's Nursery and five primary schools in Bedminster: * North Street Nursery * Holy Cross RC Primary School * Parson Street Primary School * Victoria Park Primary School * Compass Point: South Street School and Children's Centre (known as South Street Primary School before April 2010) * Oasis Academy Marksbury Road And one secondary school, Bedminster Down School.  Transport  The two main shopping streets in Bedminster, East Street and North Street, form part of the A38 road, extending from Bedminster Bridge over the New Cut to Bedminster Down. The Bristol to Exeter railway line passes through Bedminster, and there are two railway stations, Bedminster and Parson Street. The former Ashton Gate station used to serve the Ashton area and Bristol City F.C. Sport and recreation Bedminster is home to many sports teams, including Broad Plain Rugby Club, who play in the Bristol Combination league, and Bedminster Cricket Club, which was founded in 1847 and has historical links with W. G. Grace, who play in the West of England Premier League. Broad Plain RFC are based at Bristol South End, off St Johns Lane, which was the home of Bristol City Football Club before they moved to Ashton Gate, and later the sports and social club associated with E. S. & A. Robinson. Bedminster is home to one of Bristol's two city farms, below Windmill Hill, and also the national headquarters for the Federation of City Farms. Opposite the city farm is Bristol's Hackspace, a shared workshop for electronics and robotics hobbyists. A greyhound racing track called the Magnet Racecourse was opened on 9 June 1928, on South Liberty Lane, Long Ashton. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The NGRC refused to license the Magnet Greyhound Racing Company because the district already had licensed tracks at Eastville Stadium and Knowle Stadium. Racing was held as many as five times per week on what was described as a horse-shoe shape with the main distance being 475 yards. The track closed on 26 August 1932.  Council ward  The Bedminster council ward does not include the northern part of Bedminster, which is in Southville ward. Nor does it include the area east of the railway line, which is in Windmill Hill ward. Bedminster Down is in Bishopsworth ward. Bedminster ward does include the district of Ashton Vale, to the south of Bedminster. =Ashton Vale= Ashton Vale includes an area of housing centred on Ashton Drive and South Liberty Lane, served by Ashton Vale Primary School. The northern part of Ashton Vale, adjacent to the Portishead Railway line, is mixed light industrial and retail outlets. =Politics= The Bedminster council ward elects two members of Bristol City Council. Celia Phipps and Mark Bradshaw are the current ward councillors, both of whom are members of the Labour Party. Bedminster is part of the Bristol South constituency, whose MP is Karin Smyth of the Labour Party since 2015.

Friendly's was founded in 1935 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by the Blake brothers S. Prestley Blake and Curtis Blake. It has 10,000 employees; George Michel is the CEO. It offers as diner-style cuisine and highlights its 22 ice cream flavors; many locations offer an ice-cream only take-out window alongside of the table service option. A total of 167 Friendly's are spread across Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Vermont. History Friendly's was founded in 1935, at the height of the Great Depression, by brothers Prestley and Curtis Blake in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Blake brothers opened a small ice cream shop named \\"Friendly\\", selling double-dip cones for 5 cents each. In 1940, a second Friendly in West Springfield was opened with an expanded food menu. During World War II, the Blakes closed the business until the war's end. By 1951, 10 Friendlys were operating in Connecticut and western Massachusetts. The expansion of the company led to the move of headquarters from Springfield to Wilbraham in 1960. By 1974 the chain had grown to 500 restaurants in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Midwest. That year, a food processing and distribution plant opened in Troy, Ohio. Friendly's in Unionville, Connecticut in March 2008 (closed in December 2014) In 1979, the Blake brothers retired and sold Friendly to Hershey Foods Corporation, which operated the chain as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1988, Donald N. Smith purchased Friendly from the Hershey corporation, with Friendly becoming part of Tennessee Foods. In 1989, Smith added the 's to Friendly, making its colloquial name official. States with Friendly's locations In 1997, Friendly Ice Cream Corporation debuted on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol FRND. The stock began at $18 per share, peaking at $26. Around then, 34 stores were sold to DavCo Restaurants, which planned 100 openings in the next 10 years. Despite DavCo's efforts, Friendly's stock price fell to $5. Also in 1997, Friendly's exited the Pittsburgh market after an unsuccessful few-year stint, closing all six restaurants, however they were sold and converted to Bob Evans by the spring of 1998. In 1998, Kim Andereck was brought in as vice president of franchise development and became instrumental in creating an aggressive franchise program for the chain, which had been company-owned. Now, about 50% of its restaurants are franchise-owned. In summer 2000, Friendly's switched to the American Stock Exchange; symbol FRN. In June 2007, Friendly's appointed president and CEO George Condos; that summer it was bought for $337 million by the private investment firm Sun Capital Partners, Inc. In December 2008, Ned R. Lidvall was appointed president and CEO. On August 5, 2009, the first Friendly's Express opened in Mansfield, Massachusetts, with three in 2010: April 28 at Coolidge Corner in Brookline, July 7 in Wareham, and September 28 in Methuen. On February 10, 2012, Harsha V. Agadi stepped down as chief executive officer. Agadi has invested some of his own money in the company and remains on the board of directors. On April 12, 2012, Friendly's announced that John M. Maguire had been named chief executive officer of the company. On November 25, 2014 it was announced that all 14 of the Friendly's locations in Ohio would be closing. In May 2016, Sun Capital sold Friendly's ice cream manufacturing business and trademark (which will be leased back) to Dean Foods for $155 million. On June 20, 2016, Dean Foods announced the acquisition of Friendly's Ice Cream for $155 million. This did not change the ownership of the restaurants, as Sun Capital Partners continues to run the currently existing locations.Friendly's sells retail ice cream and manufacturing, new owner promises to keep Wilbraham factory Jim Kinney, Masslive.com, May 10, 2016 In early 2018, Friendly's opened a new \\"prototype\\" restaurant at the Apex Center in Marlborough, Massachusetts, to test delivery, catering, online ordering and a revised menu. Friendly's abruptly closed most of their locations in upstate New York April 7, 2019. Several locations in New England were also among the closures. Co-founder Curtis Blake died on May 24, 2019 at the age of 102.Curtis Blake-obituary On August 19, 2019, Friendly's closed its North Providence location, its last in Rhode Island. In early October 2019, the last remaining restaurant in Virginia closed. It was located in Chester, Virginia. =Bankruptcy= A casualty of a tough economic environment, rising commodity costs, and changing customer tastes, Friendly's announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and closed 63 stores in October 2011. The company had secured more than $71 million in debtor-in-possession financing to keep it afloat during bankruptcy proceedings. Later that month, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency responsible for protecting workers' pension benefits, accused Sun Capital of illegally moving assets to keep control of the company. A few days later both parties were able to reach a settlement. On November 1, 2011, the US Bankruptcy Court gave Friendly's permission to sell the company at an auction on December 22, 2011. On December 21, Friendly Ice Cream Corp cancelled the auction after receiving no offers to compete with the $75 million offer made by an affiliate of its owner, Sun Capital Partners Inc. Sun Capital paid about $75 million and retained ownership through its affiliate. On January 9, 2012, Friendly's announced the closure of 37 more stores, but that the company had emerged from bankruptcy protection. As of January 30, 2013, Friendly's has been climbing out of bankruptcy and renovating their restaurants and menus. Friendly's has closed about 100 stores since filing for bankruptcy protection in October 2011. Southern Foods Group, LLC d/b/a Dean Foods, and forty-two (42) affiliated companies, including Friendly's, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on November 12, 2019 as case number 19-36313. Legal issues In 2003, Prestley Blake filed a lawsuit against Friendly Ice Cream Corporation and chairman Donald Smith in a derivative action to force the money back to the company which Blake claimed it was improperly paid for use of a private jet. Blake accused Smith of using the jet for personal use and using the airplane lease to carry $3 million annually from the company into another restaurant chain he controlled.

Schirmer worked in Norway from 1838 to 1883 and put his mark on a number of public buildings. He contributed significantly to the introduction of the so-called Swiss architectural style in Norway, based partly on Italian villa style, Gothic Revival, and neoclassicism. Biography Schirmer was born in Leipzig, Germany. He was the son of Johan Gottlieb Schirmer and Johanne Sophie K√ºhne. He was the father of the architect Adolf Schirmer. He received his architectural education at art academies in Dresden from 1831 to 1834, and in Munich from 1834 to 1837. In Munich he was influenced by German neoclassicist architect Leo von Klenze and his nation- building and urban design ideas. Schirmer was construction manager for the rebuilding of the Oslo Cathedral between 1849 and 1850. In 1853 he entered into a partnership with the fellow German-born architect Wilhelm von Hanno. Their partnership lasted until 1864. Among their works were Gaustad Hospital, Tangen Church (1854), Vestre Aker Church (1853‚Äì1855) and √òstre Aker Church (1857‚Äì1860). Schirmer and Hanno designed all stations on Norway's first railway line, the Hoved Line between Christiania and Eidsvoll, finished in 1854. His partnership with Hanno ended in 1864. Among Schirmer's later works are the designs of churches in √òksendal (1864), √òrsta (1864), Fiskum (1866, burned 1902), Hareid (1877) and Vartdal (1877). Schirmer's first large commission was the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral, which was then in ruins. He started his preliminary investigations in 1841, finished the drawings in 1845, and the reconstruction work started in 1869. Schirmer's last major works in Norway were the creation of the hospitals Rikshospitalet, built between 1874 and 1883, and Ullev√•l Hospital from 1887. Personal life Schirmer was appointed a knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1860. Schirmer married Sophie Ottilia Major (1821‚Äì1861). They were the parents of the architects Adolf Schirmer (1850‚Äì1930) and Herman Major Schirmer (1845‚Äì1913).

He also wrote the Martyrology of Donegal in the 17th Century.Martyrology_of_Donegal, Codecs Signature page from the Annals of the Four Masters. √ì Cl√©irigh's signature is first in the list Background and early life Grandson of Tuathal √ì Cl√©irigh, a chief of the sept of U√≠ Chl√©irigh in Donegal, he was born in Kilbarron near Creevy, between Rossnowlagh and Ballyshannon on Donegal Bay. He was baptised Tadhg √ì Cl√©irigh and was known by the nickname Tadhg an tSl√©ibhe (meaning Tadhg of the mountain), but took the name of M√≠che√°l when he became a Franciscan friar. He was the youngest of four sons of Donnchadh √ì Cl√©irigh and his mother was On√≥ra Ultach. Of his older brothers were Uilliam, Conaire and Maolmhuire, Conaire is known to have worked on the annals as a scribe, while Maolmhuire also became a Franciscan at Louvain.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20498 Miche√°l was a cousin of Lughaidh √ì Cl√©irigh (fl. 1595‚Äì1630), also famous as an Irish historian and author of one of the major sources of the annals. As a member of one of the foremost learned families of Gaelic Ireland, √ì Cl√©irigh received a wide-ranging and thorough education. He records that he was taught, for instance, by a Baothghalach Ruadh Mac Aodhag√°in, an individual who may have been active in County Tipperary. Tadhg followed Maolmhuire to continental Europe some time after the Flight of the Earls. He may be the Don Tadeo Cleri who was serving as a soldier in Spain in July 1621. At some point before March 1623 he became a lay brother of the Franciscan order. He was never ordained a priest. Scholarship √ì Cl√©irigh had already gained a reputation as an antiquary and student of Irish history and Irish literature, when he entered the Irish College of St Anthony at Louvain (Dutch: Leuven). In 1624, through the initiative of Aedh Buidh Mac-An-Bhaird (1580‚Äì1635), warden of the college, and himself a famous Irish historian and poet, and one of an old family of hereditary bards in Tyrconnell, he began to collect Irish manuscripts and to transcribe everything he could find of historical importance. To do this he returned to Ireland in 1626 and spent over a decade based at a Franciscan house by the River Drowes on the Donegal-Leitrim border. He was assisted by other Irish scholars, most notably C√∫ Choigcr√≠che √ì Cl√©irigh, Fearfeasa √ì Maol Chonaire and Peregrinus √ì Duibhgeannain. √ì Cl√©irigh travelled widely throughout Ireland during this period, collecting and transcribing a vast quantity of Irish texts. His initial focus was material of ecclesiastical importance, particularly saints' lives, but by 1631 he and his colleagues were beginning to copy secular material such as the Irish pseudo-history Leabhar Gabh√°la. In 1632 the group began to assemble the most extensive set of Irish annals ever compiled. The project took four years and resulted in the vast collection dubbed Ann√°la R√≠oghachta √âireann (Annals of the kingdom of Ireland) but now better known as the Annals of the Four Masters.The Annals have been edited and published in digital form as part of the CELT project, University College, Cork: http://celt.ucc.ie/irlpage.html The 'four masters' in question are M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh, C√∫ Choigcr√≠che √ì Cl√©irigh, Fearfeasa √ì Maol Chonaire and Peregrine √ì Duibhgeannain and the term was devised by John Colgan. However, other important collaborators included Muiris mac Torna U√≠ Mhaolchonaire √ì Cl√©irigh's brother Conaire. The work was completed in August 1636 and two manuscript copies of the annals were made. He had an interest in Irish Lexicography and compiled a famous glossary called ‚ÄòSanas√°n Mhich√≠l U√≠ Chl√©irigh‚Äô (Michael O‚ÄôClery's Glossary). This glossary was printed in 1643 during the author's lifetime. These two glossaries and others are valuable for the etymological and encyclopaedic information contained in them. Among the other works copied and compiled in this period were Reim Rioghroidhe (Royal List) in 1630, Leabhar Gabh√°la (Book of Invasions) in 1631, Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib. He subsequently produced his Martyrologium of Irish saints, based on various ancient manuscripts, such as the Martyrology of Tallaght. Later life and legacy He returned to the continent in early 1637. The only work by √ì Cl√©irigh to be published in his lifetime, a glossary called Focl√≥ir n√≥ Sanas√°n Nua, appeared in 1643. His precise date of death is unknown, but he is generally thought to have died at Louvain in 1643.

It was named for being the second Sasol extraction refinery producing oil from coal, after Sasolburg, some to the west. History =Early history= During 1974, Sasol (Transvaal) Townships Limited, a subsidiary company of Sasol Limited, was instructed to establish and develop Secunda. After the site for the Sasol complex had been identified, it had to be decided whether or not to combine the existing towns of Evander and Trichardt. The huge burden that extensions of this nature would have had on the financial and administrative resources of the established communities as well as the tempo at which such development should proceed was decisive and resulted in the decision to develop Trichardt and Secunda to be one town, named Secunda. Evander however stayed a separate town. On 28 June 1976, the first town area was proclaimed. 1976 saw the first resident of Secunda moving in. Mr Etienne Prop Smith moved into Tuyshuys, the original house of the farm Goede Hoop, on which Secunda was built. One of the many refineries at the respective plants was the target of two attempted bombings by the African National Congress. The first, unsuccessful bombing occurred in 1980, and the second, partly successful bombing a few years later. Patrick Chamusso was wrongly accused of the first attempt, and as a result of his arrest and torture he became an ANC activist and was instrumental in carrying out the second as part of the ANC's campaign of attacks on South African industrial facilities. This episode is recounted in the film Catch a Fire, released in 2006. Geography Another important factor determining its location, was the availability of water. Water for Sasol is supplied from Grootdraai Dam near Standerton. =Streetscape= The layout of the town is unique in the sense that residential quarter cells were laid out which are bordered by main routes and green strips, with the result that only internal traffic is found within such cells. Access to schools, the Central Business District and the suburban shopping centres is made easier for pedestrians and cyclists as the green strips are free from vehicles and the distance to be travelled is shorter. =Architecture= Today distinctive features of the landscape around Secunda are the massive cooling towers, high chimneys and the steel structures unique to the South-African oil-from-coal industry. The highest structure in Secunda is the 301-metre-high chimney at the Sasol Three plant. The chimney is an Eskom type chimney comprising four refractory brick-lined concrete fluor of 4.6-metre diameter each. The windshield is 292 metres high with an internal diameter of 26 metres. The chimney was constructed by Concor as part of a contract to construct the Sasol Three steamplant with Hochtief. The foundations of the chimney comprised vertical and raked piles. This chimney is one of the tallest free-standing structures in the Southern Hemisphere. =Topography= Secunda is situated on the latitude 26¬∞ and longitude 29¬∞ and is 1,620 meters above sea level. It is 180 kilometers from Pretoria, 135 kilometers from Johannesburg, 100 km from Brakpan and 250 km from Potchefstroom. =Climate= During the summer, Secunda has a very pleasant climate with an average temperature of 26.5 ¬∞C. During the winter, the nights are cold, and frost regularly occurs. The days are dry, sunny and warm with an average day temperature of 16.2 ¬∞C. Demographics The town has approximately 40,198 inhabitants, with an estimated 118,889 people living in nearby township, named eMbalenhle - meaning \\"pretty flower\\". The town has experienced significant growth in the past few years due to the expansions underway at the Sasol complexes. Economy =Industry= Secunda has the 1973 oil crisis to thank for its existence, as it was founded to make South Africa less dependent on the importation of crude oil. It is doubtful whether an industry such as Sasol Synfuels ever formed part of the plans when Sasol One was formed in the 1950s. Sasol Two (1 March 1980) and Sasol Three (10 May 1982), known as Secunda CTL, the largest coal liquefaction plant in the world, produces synthetic fuel, diesel, and related fuels and petrochemicals from coal gasification. Sasol Synfuels (previously known as Sasol Two and Sasol Three) are large industrial refineries, within view, and sometimes earshot, of the town of Secunda. =Mining= As coal is the main ingredient for the industrial process, Sasol Two had to be developed around a coal field. The four coal mines, namely Brandspruit, Middelbult, Bosjesspruit, and Twistdraai, form the largest underground coal mining complex in South Africa and annually supply approximately 37,3 million tons of coal to Sasol Synthetic Fuels. A further two mines, Impumelelo (2014) and Shondoni (2015) were opened to help supply a total of a third of the countries coal for the project. Culture and contemporary life In February 1977 Secunda's first library was opened, located in the kitchen, lounge and dining rooms of a house in Danie Theron Street. At this time a clinic service was also introduced, with personnel of the Transvaal Council for Non-Urban areas visiting Secunda twice a week. The clinic was located in the same house as the library. A permanent service with permanent personnel was established in 1978. Other important occasions were the opening of the Secunda Sports Stadium on 1 February 1986, as well as the opening and handing over of the Johannes Stegmann Theatre by Sasol Limited on 6 August 1986. On 11 November 1987 an ultra modern library was opened. This library is known as the Jan Coertzen Public Library and has a reference, an adult, children's and a music section as well as an auditorium with conference facilities. In 1994 a community center was completed in Secunda. It was named after Rev. Casper Breedt. A shopping mall was also opened in late 2013, hosting a large Checkers and Game, a 3D cinema and many shops commonly found in a Gauteng mall. A fitness centre owned by Sasol operates in the centre of the business district, and is open to the public. Secunda is also the host town of a casino called \\"Graceland\\", a building based on the times of Elvis' American culture. The Waterfront next to the sports stadium also has entertainment. A free, weekly, 5 km parkrun takes place every Saturday morning at 8:00am. The event is hosted by local volunteers and was first held on Saturday 25 October 2014. https://www.parkrun.co.za/secunda/results/eventhistory/ Law and government =Government= On 3 November 1975, the Health Committee of Secunda was established by means of an Administrative Proclamation, to carry out the functions for local government. At this time Secunda still had no residents. The original Committee consisted of five members. At that stage, the only official was Mr. JF Coertzen, whose job designation was Secretary. He commenced his duties on 1 May 1976 with his office in Pretoria, as the then Chairman of the Committee was stationed in Pretoria and no office accommodation was available in Secunda. On 1 December 1976, the Secretary moved to Secunda and occupied offices, consisting of two rooms in a house situated at No 4 Danie Theron Street. At this time about 150 families resided in Secunda, with more moving in daily. The Health Committee was later expanded to seven committee members, of whom six were appointed by the Administrator from a list of names submitted by Sasol, whilst the remaining member was appointed by the Administrator himself. Secunda acquired Town Council status on 5 November 1985. Secunda is now part of the Govan Mbeki Local Municipality (formerly Highveld East Local Municipality) situated in the Gert Sibande District, of Mpumalanga. Secunda is the seat of the municipality. Education Secunda has three high schools, two of them having started out with Afrikaans as the only tuition language: High School Oosterland, and High School Secunda. The third, Highveld Park High School was founded with English as the language of education. Now the two formerly mentioned offer tuition in both languages.

(MAM). It was founded by Gordon Mills and Tom Jones and distributed by Decca Records. The first single released on MAM was \\"I Hear You Knocking\\" by Dave Edmunds in 1970. Later that year, Gilbert O'Sullivan started his run of hit singles on MAM with \\"Nothing Rhymed\\",Every Chart Topper Tells a Story: The Seventies by Sharon Davis, Mainstream Publishing, Edinburgh. and he also provided MAM with its first hit album in 1971 with Himself. Other hit albums such as Back to Front, I'm a Writer, Not a Fighter, and A Stranger In My Own Back Yard followed. Lynsey de Paul signed to the label in 1972 and her run of hit singles on MAM started with \\"Sugar Me\\". She also released her debut album, Surprise (Lynsey de Paul album), on MAM in 1973, and a best of compilation album, The World of Lynsey de Paul (also known as Lynsey Sings) in 1974. Engelbert Humperdinck was also a major recording artist with MAM; Gordon Mills was Engelbert Humperdinck's manager. While not scoring any hits, the label also released singles by Frank Ifield as well as Johnny Nash, Leapy Lee and Tina Charles. Distribution of MAM records switched to EMI in the mid 1970s. The company was one of the most successful record companies in the United Kingdom throughout the early 1970s. It diversified into slot machines and airlines but, by the end of the 1970s, it was losing ground to American companies such as RCA Records. MAM was sold in the 1980s to Chrysalis Records. Following the sale of Chrysalis to EMI Records in 1991, many recordings previously owned by MAM were reissued by EMI. After the breakup of EMI, Chrysalis was sold to BMG Rights Management. Now MAM's catalogue belongs to BMG, and is distributed by Warner Music's ADA. Staff In 1978, Tab Martin and Dominic De Sousa were working for the label. Martin joined up as head of A&R; and creative services. De Sousa was responsible for UK artists liaison.

Made of Carboniferous Limestone, it is a continuation of the Mendip Hills. Two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The cliffs on the northern and southern flanks of Brean Down have large quantities of fossils laid down in the marine deposits about 320‚Äì350 million years ago. The site has been occupied by humans since the late Bronze Age and includes the remains of a Romano-Celtic Temple. At the seaward end is Brean Down Fort which was built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War. Brean Down is now owned by the National Trust, and is rich in wildlife, history and archaeology. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to both the geology and presence of nationally rare plants including the white rock-rose. It has also been scheduled as an ancient monument. Geology An aerial view of Brean Down The cliffs on the south side showing fractures in the limestone. The Mendip Hills, of which Brean Down forms the most westerly part, are the most southerly Carboniferous Limestone upland in Britain. These rock strata were laid down during the early Carboniferous period, about 320‚Äì350 million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe underwent continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny near the end of the Carboniferous period, 300 million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe. As a result of the Variscan mountain- building, the Mendip area now comprises at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. West of the main Mendip plateau the Carboniferous Limestone continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. Brean Down is just over long and runs in an east-west direction near the mouth of the River Axe opposite Uphill Cliff. The flat area on the top of the peninsula may represent a raised bench laid down when the sea level was much higher than it is today, as the highest point of the promontory is approximately above sea level. The cliffs on the north and south faces are rich in fossils that include corals, seashells and crinoids, which supports the theory of the marine deposition of the rocks. 13 separate layers have been identified in the 'sand cliff' on the south side, the lowest five dating to the millennia of the last glaciation. History Brean Down Fort Human occupation dates back to the Beaker culture of the late Bronze Age. There is also evidence of an Iron Age hill fort and prehistoric barrows and field systems. There is evidence of a shrine dating from pre-Roman times, which was re-established as a Romano-Celtic Temple in the mid-4th century. According to at least one source, it is extremely likely this was succeeded by a small late-4th-century Christian oratory. Several Roman finds including gold coins of Augustus, Nero, and Drusus, two silver denarii of Vespasian and a Roman carnelian ring were found at the site during quarrying. Brean Down Fort was built on the headland between 1864 and 1871 on the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission. It was the most southerly of a chain of defences across the Bristol Channel, protecting the access to Bristol and Cardiff. Four acres of land at the end of Brean Down were requisitioned in 1862, with construction beginning in 1864 and completed in 1871. In the 1860s plans were laid for a deep-water harbour on the northern shore of Brean Down. It was intended that this harbour would replace Bristol as a port on embarkation for transatlantic crossings and the export of minerals and agricultural produce from the Mendip Hills and the rest of Somerset. The foundation stones of the pier were laid, but the project was later abandoned after a large storm destroyed the foundations. In 1897, following wireless transmissions from Lavernock Point in Wales and Flat Holm, Guglielmo Marconi moved his equipment to Brean Down and set a new distance record of for wireless transmission over open sea. In 1912 Brean Down was leased by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds as a bird sanctuary, acquiring the shooting rights to stop others shooting on the promontory. Concrete arrow On the outbreak of World War II, the fort was rearmed with two 6-inch (15-centimetre) ex-naval guns, and machine gun posts were built on the Down. Birnbeck Pier was taken over by the Admiralty in 1941 as an outpost of the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD). It was commissioned as HMS Birnbeck, and was used for secret weapons development and storage with testing. The \\"Bouncing bomb\\" was tested at the Brean Down Fort on the opposite side of Weston Bay. In 1954 the former Axbridge Rural District Council gave of the down to the National Trust to celebrate the Festival of Britain. The Major Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Weston-Super Mare gave in 1963, and a further at Brean Down Cove was acquired from M.D. and M Matthews in 2000. After restoring the fort, which covers , Sedgemoor District Council gave this to the trust as well in 2002. Various proposals have been put forward to construct a Severn Barrage for tidal electricity production from Brean Down to Lavernock Point in south Wales. The proposals, which go back over 100 years, have never been successful so far, however Peter Hain and others are still working on further proposals and trying to persuade the government to fund either the barrage or tidal lagoons. Ecology White rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum) on the south cliff of Brean Down In addition to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on the upper reaches of the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae). Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather. The birds seen on Brean Down include peregrine falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and stock doves, common whitethroat, common linnet, stonechat, dunnock, rock pipit and ‚Äì in 2007 ‚Äì Britain's first and only Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross was discovered in a garden nearby. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.

The majority of the acts on Mammoth were executive-produced by Faires and the label's general manager, Steve Balcom. The label was the first independent to produce two platinum records. Mammoth's roster included Antenna, The Backsliders, The Bats, Blake Babies, Chainsaw Kittens, Dash Rip Rock, Dillon Fence, Frente!, Fu Manchu, Fun-Da-Mental, Jason & the Scorchers, Jocelyn Montgomery, Joe Henry, Juliana Hatfield, Kill Creek, Machines of Loving Grace, My Friend Steve, Seven Mary Three, Squirrel Nut Zippers, The Hope Blister, The Melvins, The Sidewinders, Vanilla Trainwreck, Victoria Williams.  History  Mammoth first signed Tucson band The Sidewinders; The Sidewinder's debut album, Witchdoctor, sold to RCA within Mammoth's first three months of business. Another early signing, Blake Babies, led by Berklee School of Music students Juliana Hatfield and John Strohm, released ‚ÄúEarwig‚Äù and ‚ÄúSunburn‚Äù with Mammoth before breaking up. John Strohm went on to release two solo albums with Mammoth under the moniker Antenna while Juliana Hatfield released solo efforts Hey Babe and Only Everything with Mammoth. Louisiana Music Hall of Famer Dash Rip Rock signed to Mammoth with its 1989 release, Ace of Clubs, produced by Jim Dickinson. Chainsaw Kittens released four albums with Mammoth, including its second album, Flipped Out in Singapore, which was Butch Vig‚Äôs follow-up project after producing Nirvana‚Äôs Nevermind. The first signing from the local Chapel Hill college scene was Dillion Fence; the group released three albums on the Mammoth label between 1991 and 1995. Also from the local area, Mammoth signed Vanilla Trainwreck; the band released Sofa Livin‚Äô Dreamazine and two other albums. After The Sidewinders, a second Tucson band‚ÄîMachines of Loving Grace‚Äîwas signed to Mammoth. That band released three albums with Mammoth between 1991 and 1995 with the album Concentration gaining national attention. Multiple Grammy Award winner Joe Henry released albums with Mammoth between 1992 and 2001, including Trampoline and Fuse. Through a distribution deal with Les Claypool‚Äôs Prawn Song Records, Mammoth released The Charlie Hunter Trio‚Äôs self-titled album in 1993; Charlie Hunter went on to sign with the jazz label Blue Note Records. The label‚Äôs early success across a spectrum of genres with acts like Blake Babies, Chainsaw Kittens, Dash Rip Rock, Dillon Fence, Juliana Hatfield, Joe Henry and Machines of Loving Grace attracted the attention of Atlantic Records. Mammoth and Atlantic Records formed a joint venture in 1992. During the Atlantic era, Mammoth signed Frente!. Frente!‚Äôs cover of New Order‚Äôs ‚ÄúBizarre Love Triangle‚Äù went Top 10 on Billboard Modern Rock Charts, and its record, Marvin The Album, shipped more than 750,000 copies worldwide. The label also added Victoria Williams to its roster, releasing her albums, Loose and This Moment: In Toronto with the Loose Band. Mammoth set a precedent for recognizing and promoting female, alternative voices with acts, such as The Black Girls, Blake Babies, Juliana Hatfield, Frente!, and Victoria Williams. Frente!, which MTV labeled \\"Buzz Bin\\", and Hatfield both sold more than 250,000 records. When Chris Douridas was the director of music at KCRW, Mammoth teamed with the radio station to release Rare on Air, a four-part compilation series featuring artists such as Radiohead, Tori Amos, Lindsey Buckingham, Los Lobos, Beck, Nick Cave, John Cale, World Party, Philip Glass, The Cranberries, Jackson Browne, Fiona Apple, Ben Folds, James Taylor, Ani Difranco, Randy Newman, Jeff Buckley, Mazzy Starr, Patti Smith, Tom Waits, PJ Harvey and Lucinda Williams. Nashville-based Jason and the Scorchers had a second life after signing with Mammoth Records and released three albums with the label. In 1996, the New Orleans Dirty Dozen Brass Band, released Ears to the Wall with Mammoth, an album produced by The Black Crowes‚Äô Chris Robinson. Seven Mary Three recorded three albums between 1995 and 1998 with Mammoth. Its debut album, American Standard, sold 1.3 million copies aloft the single \\"Cumbersome\\", making Seven Mary Three the record label's first platinum seller. In 1997, Mammoth Records returned to an independent label. Squirrel Nut Zippers released six albums with Mammoth from 1994 to 2000; its second album, Hot, was released towards the end of 1996 and climbed the charts as Mammoth separated from Atlantic. Hot became Mammoth's second platinum record. As an independent, the label also saw the release of Jocelyn Montgomery's ‚ÄúEt Ideo,‚Äù produced by David Lynch. Later, Mammoth made headway with big beat and the early electronic movement from the United Kingdom with bands like The Freestylers, which MTV deemed ‚ÄúBuzzworthy,‚Äù and The Wiseguys, whose single ‚ÄúOoh La La‚Äù on The Antidote became a breakout party anthem. Founder of British label 4AD and leader of This Mortal Coil, Ivo Watts-Russell released his band The Hope Blisters' album Smiles OK on Mammoth in the U.S, an album including work from by other artists, including Brian Eno and John Cale. Mammoth artists were featured on soundtracks for The Crow (Machines of Loving Grace) alongside Nine Inch Nails and Rage Against the Machine, The Crow: City of Angels (Seven Mary Three) alongside Hole and White Zombie, Hurricane Streets (Pure and Seven Mary Three) alongside Mary's Playground and Xzibit, My So Called Life (Frente!, Chainsaw Kittens and Juliana Hatfield) alongside Sonic Youth and The Lemonheads, Trey Parker and Matt Stone‚Äôs Orgazmo (The Dust Brothers) alongside Wu-Tang Clan and Dilated Peoples, the triple platinum album for Reality Bites (Juliana Hatfield) alongside Lisa Loeb and U2, Saturday Morning Cartoons (Frente! and Juliana Hatfield) alongside Matthew Sweet and the Ramones, and the compilation album Music for Our Mother Ocean (Seven Mary Three) alongside the Beastie Boys and No Doubt. The success of the Squirrel Nut Zippers' albums, along with the development of other Mammoth bands‚Äîlike Pure with Generation Six-Pack, Fu Manchu, and the Backsliders‚Äîfocused the industry‚Äôs attention on the newly independent Mammoth. The label sold to The Walt Disney Company in late 1997.

Along with live sand, it confers to the closed marine system multiple benefits desired by the saltwater aquarium hobbyist. The name sometimes leads to misunderstandings, as the \\"live rock\\" itself is not actually alive, but rather is simply made from the aragonite skeletons of long dead corals, or other calcareous organisms, which in the ocean form the majority of coral reefs. When taken from the ocean it is usually encrusted with coralline algae and inhabited by a multitude of marine organisms. The many forms of micro and macroscopic marine life that live on and inside of the rock, which acts as an ideal habitat, give it the name \\"live rock\\". Origin Live rock is harvested for use in the aquarium trade from collections in the wild near reefs, where parts may become detached from the central body of coral by storms. It may also be \\"seeded\\" from small coralline rocks by an aquaculturalist in warm ocean water, to be harvested later. Live rock can also be seeded by adding base rock to an active reef aquarium that already has live rock. Live rock harbors a wide variety of corals, algae, sponges, and other invertebrates, when they are collected. Corals added to the aquarium later will often become attached to the rock. Purpose Live rock is highly valued in the aquarium trade. It introduces a diverse array of bacteria, algae, and invertebrates to the closed marine environment and functions as a superior biological filter that hosts aerobic and anaerobic nitrifying bacteria required for the nitrogen cycle that processes waste. Live rock becomes the main biological nitrification base or biological filter of a saltwater aquarium. Harmful elements dissolved in the water of the aquarium, including ammonia, phosphates, and nitrates, are processed with the help of the organisms that are introduced from the live rock into the aquarium‚Äôs ecosystem. Excess ammonia, nitrate, and phosphates are eliminated with the help of the algae and corals growing on the live rock‚Äôs surface, while other bacteria supplement the process and restore balance in the water chemistry. Additionally, live rocks have a stabilizing effect on the water chemistry, in particular on helping to maintain constant pH by release of calcium carbonate. Lastly, live rock, especially when encrusted with multiple colors of coralline algae, becomes a major decorative element of the aquarium and provides shelter for the inhabitants. It is often used to build caves, arches, overhangs, or other structures in the tank, a practice known as aquascaping. Live rock prior to installation into a reef tank In J. Charles Delbeek's article Your First Reef Aquarium,published in Aquarium USA in 1994, under the Live Rock section he states, Live rock must however be cured prior to aquarium installation. Many of the organisms that previously lived in the rock would have died off during the harvesting and transportation process posing a risk to an immature aquarium of rapid ammonia production due to the dead organisms decomposing. To combat this a curing process must be carried out involving leaving the rock to sit in water for up to several weeks to ensure all dead organisms have decomposed and no longer pose a threat to water quality. Types Bleached coral skeletons, which can be inhabited by micro- and macro-organisms to form live rock There are many different types of live rock. Each is named after the area from which it originated. A large amount of live rock comes from the Southern Pacific region, in areas such as Fiji, Tonga, and the Marshall Islands, as well as from the Caribbean. Each has its own distinct qualities that make it preferable to certain reef aquarists. For instance, live rock from the Fiji region is often porous and large, and rock from the Tonga region is often dense and elongated. =Base rock= Base rock, or dry rock, is a generic term for aragonite rock that has no organisms growing in or on the rock.What is Live Rock in About.com Base rock is often used as filler rock in the aquarium as it is much cheaper to purchase than live rock. In time, base rock will become colonized by living organisms. Recently base rock that is mined from inland ancient reefs has become a popular way to keep the aquarium trade going sustainably. This rock is either maricultured and sold as live rock, or can be purchased and grown in the home aquarium. Base rock can also be made from artificial rock called aragocrete, which is a hand made concrete from combining crushed aragonite, sand, and Portland cement. After allowing the cement to dry, the pieces are sometimes acid washed to counteract the high pH of the materials, and then allowed to soak in clean water for one or more months. They generally tend to be heavier and less attractive when compared to natural base rock. Collection ban As of August 4, 2008 CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) banned the collection of live rock from Tonga, the Marshall Islands, and the Cook Islands. This is due to the over-collecting of rock in these areas. This ban remains in effect as of 2020.

They function as handcuffs but are cheaper and easier to carry than metal handcuffs, and they cannot be reused. The device was first introduced in 1965. Types A traditional form of plastic handcuffs are cable ties, with either two interlocking straps, or a single cable tie around both wrists. More recently, plastics-manufacturing companies have started to produce special devices comprising two interconnected straps as one item. These are generally injection moulded nylon items, selling for tens of cents each. Various innovations on the plastic handcuff theme have been developed, including models which can be released using a regular handcuff key, and extremely lightweight restraints made from nylon cord, using a plastic device to hold the cord tight. Advantages The low cost and light weight of plastic handcuffs has made them popular with police and military forces when they anticipate a large number of arrests, as in riot control or demonstrations. An advantage of disposable restraints is avoidance of transmission of communicable disease; metal handcuffs can spread disease through reuse (from blood or other bodily fluids that may not have been cleaned off the cuffs), disposable restraints are not used on multiple subjects. Precautions If not applied correctly, plastic handcuffs are more uncomfortable than conventional handcuffs for the person being restrained. More care and training are required for the person applying them in order to avoid making them too tight. Some models cannot be double-locked, making it possible for the cuffs to be further tightened after initial application, restricting blood flow to the hands and causing injury to the subject. Another risk of disposable restraints is that a subject of great physical strength and/or under the influence of drugs may be able to break free from them with enough effort. They are also vulnerable to being cut with wire cutters or melted with a cigarette lighter. In official uses, it is recommended to use a specialized flexicuff cutter to remove the cuffs from a detainee, rather than scissors or knives which could cause injury to the detained or detainer.

This division has over 9500 students enrolled, with 365 support personnel, 475 teachers, and 88 division owned buses (2200 kids ride the bus everyday). There are a total of 14 microwave towers in the rural centres of the district, which ensure that rural students have access to high speed networking. There are six community schools, and three schools providing French immersion. A police liaison program is provided in the urban centre where the officer has a school office. This division contains the largest high school in Saskatchewan: Carlton Comprehensive High School (operating since 1975). The division is located mainly in the Aspen parkland and boreal forest biomes, and is named for the North Saskatchewan, South Saskatchewan, and Saskatchewan Rivers which are all found in the area it encompasses. Prior to 1997, the Saskatchewan Rivers School Division was two separate divisions. There were the rural elementaries and Wesmor as the high school for all rural kids (Rural Division). And there was the urban division which had only Carlton for its high school. Since then the divisions have merged and a new high school was created: PACI (Prince Albert Central Institute). The division also merged in the small communities: Christopher Lake, Meath Park, Birch Hills and Kinistino. Following the break-up of the Wakaw School Division, St. Louis school also joined Saskatchewan Rivers. The Parkland School Division #63 out of Shellbrook also merged into Sask Rivers welcoming the communities of Shellbrook, Canwood, Debden & Big River. There are also two programs for minorities: the Wonska High School for Aboriginal students and the Star Program for kids with social difficulties.

It had a distribution deal with Decca Records. Artists on the label included the Dubliners and Johnny Nash. Phil Solomon was also co-director of Radio Caroline in the mid-1960s. In August 1967 the Wilson government outlawed pirate radio and, although Radio Caroline continued, it started excessively promoting records from the Major Minor label. Caroline's DJs were unhappy with the type of music they were being forced to play and it is doubtful that much of the revenue from the record label actually went back into the radio station. In March 1968, the two Caroline ships were silenced when they were seized by creditors. Major Minor's big chart moment came in 1969, when the label picked up a 'dropped' record and took it to Number 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The track, \\"Je t'aime... moi non plus\\" by Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg, was originally released on Fontana. Despite being performed in French, the song's obvious sexual tone resulted in a widescale ban from mainstream radio stations, and Fontana deleted the single during its chart ascent, allegedly because the wife of Fontana's boss was appalled at her husband's company releasing such a song. Major Minor acquired the licensing rights, and got their best selling single on the back of the controversy. Charles Aznavour is another French artist who worked with Major Minor (a single, \\"To My Daughter\\" / \\"Yesterday When I Was Young\\", and an LP, Aznavour Sings Aznavour). Soul and jazz musicians on the label included Dizzy Gillespie, Sam and Dave, the Isley Brothers, Kim Weston and Cissy Houston. Rock artists included July and Them (who were managed by Solomon). There was also an obscure pre-10cc single featuring Eric Stewart credited to the New Wave Band (\\"Cecilia\\" / \\"Free, Free, Free\\"). Rory Gallagher's band Taste also released a single on the label (\\"Blister on the Moon\\" / \\"Born on the Wrong Side of Time\\"). Also a young Peter Sarstedt cut his first single there under the name Peter Lincoln, \\"My Monkey is a Junkie\\". The other big success was Northern Ireland's David McWilliams with \\"Days of Pearly Spencer\\", leased from EMI. Other tunes that Caroline had to play included \\"Sentimental Songs\\" by Freddie \\"Parrotface\\" Davies. Major Minor's first big UK number one single came in 1968 and was \\"Mony Mony\\" by Tommy James and the Shondells. It also scored hits with pianist Neville Dickie, balladeers Karen Young and Malcolm Roberts, and bubblegum band Crazy Elephant. In July 2010, EMI announced that the label would be resurrected to release an 'expanded 20th anniversary' release of Morrissey's Bona Drag.

Grand unified theories predict Higgs bosons (doublets of SU(2)) arise from representations of the unified group that contain other states, in particular, states that are triplets of color. The primary problem with these color triplet Higgs is that they can mediate proton decay in supersymmetric theories that are only suppressed by two powers of GUT scale (i.e. they are dimension 5 supersymmetric operators). In addition to mediating proton decay, they alter gauge coupling unification. The doublet‚Äìtriplet problem is the question 'what keeps the doublets light while the triplets are heavy?' Doublet‚Äìtriplet splitting and the \\\\mu-problem In 'minimal' SU(5), the way one accomplishes doublet‚Äìtriplet splitting is through a combination of interactions \\\\int d^2\\\\theta \\\\; \\\\lambda H_{\\\\bar{5}} \\\\Sigma H_{5} + \\\\mu H_{\\\\bar{5}} H_{5} where \\\\Sigma is an adjoint of SU(5) and is traceless. When \\\\Sigma acquires a vacuum expectation value \\\\langle \\\\Sigma\\\\rangle = \\\\rm{diag}(2, 2, 2, -3, -3) f that breaks SU(5) to the Standard Model gauge symmetry the Higgs doublets and triplets acquire a mass \\\\int d^2\\\\theta \\\\; (2 \\\\lambda f + \\\\mu) H_{\\\\bar{3}}H_3 + (-3\\\\lambda f +\\\\mu) H_{\\\\bar{2}}H_2 Since f is at the GUT scale ( 10^{16} GeV) and the Higgs doublets need to have a weak scale mass (100 GeV), this requires \\\\mu \\\\sim 3 \\\\lambda f \\\\pm 100 \\\\mbox{GeV}. So to solve this doublet‚Äìtriplet splitting problem requires a tuning of the two terms to within one part in 10^{14}. This is also why the mu problem of the MSSM (i.e. why are the Higgs doublets so light) and doublet‚Äìtriplet splitting are so closely intertwined. =Dimopoulos‚ÄìWilczek mechanism= In an SO(10) theory, there is a potential solution to the doublet‚Äìtriplet splitting problem known as the 'Dimopoulos‚ÄìWilczek' mechanism. In SO(10), the adjoint field, \\\\Sigma acquires a vacuum expectation value of the form \\\\langle \\\\Sigma \\\\rangle = \\\\mbox{diag}( i \\\\sigma_2 f_3, i\\\\sigma_2 f_3, i\\\\sigma_2 f_3, i\\\\sigma_2 f_2, i \\\\sigma_2 f_2). f_2 and f_3 give masses to the Higgs doublet and triplet, respectively, and are independent of each other, because \\\\Sigma is traceless for any values they may have. If f_2=0, then the Higgs doublet remains massless. This is very similar to the way that doublet‚Äìtriplet splitting is done in either higher- dimensional grand unified theories or string theory.

He studied painting at the Munich Academy under Karl von Piloty beginning in 1861, but found that historical painting did not suit his particular talent. He soon discovered that the true expression of his genius was in the field of caricature and comic drawings, revealed in a humorous cartoon published in 1863 in the Fliegende Bl√§tter. He joined the staff of the Fliegende Bl√§tter, to which he became a constant contributor and leading artist. Unlike Wilhelm Busch, whose aim was the utmost simplicity of line, and whose drawings form a running commentary on the caption, Oberl√§nder's work is essentially pictorial, and expressive in itself, without the extraneous aid of the written line. Among his best drawings are his parodies on the style of well-known painters, such as the Variations on the Kissing Theme. Other subjects are taken from mythology, fairy lore, fables, animal life and the customs and habits of the German middle class. His works were collected in the Oberl√§nder-Album, published by Braun and Schneider in Munich (1879‚Äì1901), and reprinted a number of times, most recently by Rosenheimer in 1982 (). He was also a painter of some note, and pictures of his are in the galleries of Munich, Berlin, Dresden and other cities of Germany and in private collections.

Youth Born in 1923 in the Quebec City neighbourhood of Saint-Sauveur, Robitaille displayed talent for singing and acting at a very young age. She first performed on-stage at the Capitol Theatre at 7. At the time, she had already sung on-air with the CHRC radio station and was a real phenomenon in the whole city. Career Robi performing for CKAC in 1943 At 13 she moved to the Th√©√¢tre National, on Montreal's Saint Catherine Street. Under the direction of Rose Ouellette, she learned acting and singing during a 75-week engagement. She continued her career in the Montreal cabarets, making radio appearances. For a time during the war, she also hosted a French radio show named Tambour battant (\\"Rumbling drum\\"). Touring Canadian military bases propelled her career across Canada. During the 1940s, she started producing 78s and she became renowned far beyond Canada. She captured popular imagination with Latin titles like Besame Mucho and Tico tico, after translating herself the Spanish or Brazilian songs into French. She sang in chic New York City cabarets by the mid forties and in 1947, she travelled to England where she made an appearance on the first regular BBC television programme. Mental health In 1948, while traveling by car to Hollywood, she was injured in an accident, and entered a period of depression. After a series of unfortunate diagnoses, and a failed romance, she suffered a mental breakdown and was interned for several years in a Quebec City asylum. She was at some point subjected to a lobotomy against her will. She credited the operation with her recovery: \\"Je me r√©veillai gu√©rie et j'ai compris plus tard que j'avais √©t√© un des rares cas r√©ussis de lobotomie\\" (I woke up better and later understood that I was one of the rare lobotomy success stories).Long Cri dans la nuit: Cinq Ann√©es √† l'Asile, cited in Alys Robi , lamiredegisele.com In 1952, she was released. The same year, she came back on stage at the Casa Loma and the Montmartre, but her efforts were impeded by taboos about mental problems and she never regained the same level of popularity. Later years In the early 1990s, Alys returned into the public eye after the massive success she had with a song written for her by Alain Morisod (\\"Laissez-moi encore chanter\\"). Books, theses, plays and television series were written about her. A movie was released in December 2004: Alys Robi: Ma vie en cin√©mascope (\\"Alys Robi: My Life in Cinemascope\\"), titled Bittersweet Memories in English. Robitaille has published two autobiographies: Ma carri√®re, ma vie (\\"My Career, My Life\\", 1980) and Un long cri dans la nuit: Cinq Ann√©es √† l'Asile (\\"A Long Cry in the Night: Five Years in the Asylum\\", 1990). The last autobiography title comes from the song Un long cri dans la nuit, written and composed for Lady Alys by the songwriter Christine Charbonneau in 1989. Several of Robi's songs have been used for commercial ads. Sico, notably, played on the similarity between its brand name and the title of \\"Tico Tico\\" to produce a very catchy campaign based on a spoof of the song.

The purpose is to adjust the country's economic structure, improve international competitiveness, and restore its balance of payments. The two Bretton Woods Institutions require borrowing countries to implement certain policies in order to obtain new loans (or to lower interest rates on existing ones). These policies were typically centered around increased privatization, liberalizing trade and foreign investment, and balancing government deficit. The conditionality clauses attached to the loans have been criticized because of their effects on the social sector. SAPs are created with the goal of reducing the borrowing country's fiscal imbalances in the short and medium term or in order to adjust the economy to long-term growth. By requiring the implementation of free market programmes and policy, SAPs are intended to balance the government's budget, reduce inflation and stimulate economic growth. The liberalization of trade, privatization, and the reduction of barriers to foreign capital would allow for increased investment, production, and trade, boosting the recipient country's economy.Greenberg, James B. 1997. A Political Ecology of Structural-Adjustment Policies: The Case of the Dominican Republic. Culture & Agriculture 19 (3):85-93 Countries that fail to enact these programmes may be subject to severe fiscal discipline. Critics argue that the financial threats to poor countries amount to blackmail, and that poor nations have no choice but to comply. Since the late 1990s, some proponents of structural adjustments (also called structural reform),David B. Audretsch, Erik Lehmann, The Seven Secrets of Germany, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 104. such as the World Bank, have spoken of \\"poverty reduction\\" as a goal. SAPs were often criticized for implementing generic free-market policy and for their lack of involvement from the borrowing country. To increase the borrowing country's involvement, developing countries are now encouraged to draw up Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which essentially take the place of SAPs. Some believe that the increase of the local government's participation in creating the policy will lead to greater ownership of the loan programs and thus better fiscal policy. The content of PRSPs has turned out to be similar to the original content of bank-authored SAPs. Critics argue that the similarities show that the banks and the countries that fund them are still overly involved in the policy-making process. Within the IMF, the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility was succeeded by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, which is in turn succeeded by the Extended Credit Facility. Regions supported From the perspective of the loan area, SAL is mainly distributed to Latin American, East Asian, South Asian, North African and Sub-Saharan African countries, including Colombia, Mexico, Turkey, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sudan, Zimbabwe and other countries. As of 2018, India has been the largest recipient of structural adjustment program loans since 1990. Such loans cannot be spent on health, development or education programs. The largest of these have been to the banking sector ($2 trillion for IBRD 77880) and for Swachh Bharat Mission ($1.5 trillion for IBRD 85590). From the perspective of loan targets SALs can be divided into three categories: economic growth-oriented, correction of balance of payments structural deficits, and poverty alleviation. It is worth mentioning that, with the increasing demand for structural adjustments in various countries, the boundaries between SAL and other types of loans issued by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have become blurred. For example, both the SAL and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Loan (ESAF) issued by the International Monetary Fund tend to provide low-income member countries with preferential support for medium-term structural reforms, but enhanced structural adjustment loans are more supportive to promote growth and strengthen the balance of payments Status-oriented reform only. Another type of loan issued by the World Bank‚Äîsector adjustment loans differs from SAL only in that the former places more emphasis on intra-sector adjustments. Financing SAL initially financed the loan by selling gold held in trust funds and accepting donations from donor countries. Subsequent loans are based on the repayment of trust funds and interest earned. The SDR is the accounting unit of the loan, and the disbursement and repayment of the loan are in US dollars. The amount of SAL issued to a country is usually proportional to its quota in the International Monetary Fund. Conditions Typical stabilisation policies include: *balance of payments deficits reduction through currency devaluation *budget deficit reduction through higher taxes and lower government spending, also known as austerity *restructuring foreign debts *monetary policy to finance government deficits (usually in the form of loans from central banks) *eliminating food subsidies *raising the price of public services *cutting wages *decrementing domestic credit. Long-term adjustment policies usually include: *liberalization of markets to guarantee a price mechanism *privatization, or divestiture, of all or part of state-owned enterprises *creating new financial institutions *improving governance and fighting corruption (from the perspective of a neoliberal formulation of 'governance' and 'corruption') *enhancing the rights of foreign investors vis-√†-vis national laws *focusing economic output on direct export and resource extraction *increasing the stability of investment (by allowing foreign investors) with the opening of companies * reducing government expenditure e.g. reducing government employment In the Washington Consensus the conditions are: # Fiscal policy discipline; # Redirection of public spending from subsidies (\\"especially indiscriminate subsidies\\") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, primary health care and infrastructure investment; # Tax reforms which broaden the tax base and lower marginal tax rates, while minimizing dead weight loss and market distortions; # Interest rates that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms; # Competitive exchange rates; devaluation of currency to stimulate exports; # Trade liberalization ‚Äì liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform tariffs; the conversion of import quotas to import tariffs; # Liberalization of inward foreign direct investment; # Privatization of state enterprises; # Deregulation ‚Äì abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudent oversight of financial institutions; # Legal security for property rights. History Structural adjustment policies emerged from two of the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and the World Bank. They emerged from the conditionality that IMF and World Bank have been attaching to their loans since the early 1950s.See IMF website on conditionality Initially, these conditions focused on a country's macroeconomic policy. From the 1950s onward, the United States doled out loans and other forms of financial assistance to Third World nations (now commonly referred to as least developed countries, or LDCs). Free-market economics were encouraged in the Third World, not only as a measure of countering the spread of socialist ideology during the Cold War, but also as a means of fostering foreign direct investment (FDI) and promoting the access of foreign companies within the OECD nations to certain sectors of target economies. In particular, Western companies sought to gain access to the extraction of raw commodities, especially minerals and agricultural products. Where loans were negotiated on the basis of implementing large infrastructural projects such as roads and electrical dams, Western countries stood to gain by employing their domestic businesses and by broadening the means by which Western companies could more easily extract these resources. Loans made under SAP conditions at the time were advised by the top economists of both the IMF and World Bank. After the run on the dollar of 1979‚Äì80, the United States adjusted its monetary policy and instituted other measures so it could begin competing aggressively for capital on a global scale. This was successful, as can be seen from the current account of the country's balance of payments. Enormous capital flows to the United States had the corollary of dramatically depleting the availability of capital to poor and middling countries. Giovanni Arrighi has observed that this scarcity of capital, which was heralded by the Mexican default of 1982, Mexico was the first country to implement structural adjustment in exchange for loans. During the 1980s the IMF and WB created loan packages for the majority of countries in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa as they experienced economic crises. To this day, economists can point to few, if any, examples of substantial economic growth among the LDCs under SAPs. Moreover, very few of the loans have been paid off. Pressure mounts to forgive these debts, some of which demand substantial portions of government expenditures to service. Structural adjustment policies, as they are known today, originated due to a series of global economic disasters during the late 1970s: the oil crisis, debt crisis, multiple economic depressions, and stagflation.See Towson.edu webpage on SAPs These fiscal disasters led policy makers to decide that deeper intervention was necessary to improve a country's overall well-being. In 2002, SAPs underwent another transition, the introduction of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. PRSPs were introduced as a result of the bank's beliefs that \\"successful economic policy programs must be founded on strong country ownership\\". In addition, SAPs with their emphasis on poverty reduction have attempted to further align themselves with the Millennium Development Goals. As a result of PRSPs, a more flexible and creative approach to policy creation has been implemented at the IMF and World Bank. While the main focus of SAPs has continued to be the balancing of external debts and trade deficits, the reasons for those debts have undergone a transition. Today, SAPs and their lending institutions have increased their sphere of influence by providing relief to countries experiencing economic problems due to natural disasters or economic mismanagement. Since their inception, SAPs have been adopted by a number of other international financial institutions. Some studies suggest that they have been \\"weakly associated with growth and reform did seem to reduce inflation.\\"Crisp, Brian; Kelly, Michael. (1999) The Socioeconomic Impacts of Structural Adjustment. International Studies Quarterly. Vol. 43. No. 3 (Sept. 1999). 533-552. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600942 Others have argued, however, that \\"the outcomes associated with frequent structural adjustment lending are poor.\\"Easterly, William. (2006) The White Man's Burden. Penguin Books. Pages 68-72. Some have argued that, based on only mild improvement of growth in the 1990s from the 1980s, that the IMF should focus more on remedying management of a country's balance of payments position as originally envisaged by the IMF instead of its focusing on structural adjustments.Manmohan Agarwal and Dipankar Sengupta Economic and Political Weekly Vol. 34, No. 44 (Oct. 30 - Nov. 5, 1999), pp. 3129-3136 One study pointed towards deleterious effects on countries in Latin America's democratic practices, suggesting that reforms may create an economically and politically marginalized population who views democratic government as unresponsive to its needs and thus less legitimate. However, the existence of the IMF loan itself has not led to any change away from democracy itself.Brown, C. (2009) Democracy's Friend or Foe? The Effects of Recent IMF Conditional Lending in Latin America. International Political Science Review, Vol. 30, No. 4, 431-457. doi.org/10.1177/0192512109342522 Critics (often from the left) accuse such policies to be \\"not-so-thinly- disguised wedge[s] for capitalist interests.\\" Kapur, Davesh. (1998). The IMF: A Cure of Curse? Foreign Policy. No. 111. pp. 114-129. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1149382 =South Korea after 1997= Take South Korea after 1997 as an example. Since the loan conditions have a huge influence on the economy of the recipient countries, there are many arguments about the loan conditions. When the Asian financial crisis occurred in 1997, South Korea accepted various loan conditions while accepting the largest financial assistance in the history of the International Monetary Fund. The United States and the International Monetary Fund evaluated South Korea as one of the successful cases of the IMF's structural adjustment. They believe that South Korea has been closer to the developed countries after the IMF's structural adjustment. However, others doubt whether South Korea is a successful case of IMF structural adjustment. In the process of South Korea and the International Monetary Fund reaching an agreement, the United States played a major role in it. The US government's structural adjustment to South Korea should be based on its own interests. At present, South Korea's economic structure and financial market contain many problems, which leads to an increase in social problems in South Korea and the result of instability in South Korean society. Because the IMF is subject to the distribution of power and interests of major powers, it is difficult to implement actions with fair and objective criteria. The main reason is that the International Monetary Fund reflects the political issues of American financial hegemony and voting power to a certain extent. This has led to the request of the IMF for the aided country that may have been made while ignoring the actual situation of the aided country. It often overemphasizes market liberalization and financial market opening. In the long run, these loan conditions have brought bad results to the aided countries. =Latin America= Largely as a result of the experiences in Latin America, a new theory was formulated to build upon the experiences of the 1980s and the effects of IMF structural adjustment loans, called New Developmental Theory. This sought to build upon Classical Development Theory, by utilizing insights from Post-Keynesian Macroeconomics and Classical Political Economy, emphasizing the role of the necessity of export-oriented integration into the world economy toward industrialization, while also rejecting foreign indebtedness and management of balance of payments to avert recurrent crises.Bresser-Pereira, Luiz Carlos. (2019). From classical developmentalism and post-Keynesian macroeconomics to new developmentalism. Brazilian Journal of Political Economy, 39(2), 187-210. Epub May 02, 2019.https://doi.org/10.1590/0101-31572019-2966  Effect of SAPs  Structural adjustment programs implemented neoliberal policies that had numerous effects on the economic institutions of countries that underwent them. = End of the Structuralist model of development = After the Second World War, a Structuralist model of development relying on Import Substitutions Industrialization (ISI) had become the ubiquitous paradigm. It entailed the substitution of foreign imports by goods produced by national industries with the help of state intervention. State intervention included providing the infrastructure required by the respective industry, the protection of these local industries against foreign competition, the overvaluation of the local currency, the nationalization of key industries and a low cost of living for workers in urban areas. Comparing these inward- oriented measures to neoliberal policies demanded by the SAPs, it becomes obvious that the structuralist model was fully reversed in the course of the debt crisis of the 1980s. While the structuralist period led to rapid expansion of domestically manufactured goods and high rates of economic growth, there were also some major shortcomings such as stagnating exports, elevated fiscal deficit, very high rates of inflation and the crowding out of private investments. The search for alternative policy options thus seemed justified. Critics denounce, though, that even the productive state sectors were restructured for the sake of integrating these developing economies into the global market. The shift away from state intervention and ISI-led structuralism towards the free market and Export Led Growth opened a new development era and marked the triumph of capitalism. = Competitive insertion into the world market = Since SAPs are based on the condition that loans have to be repaid in hard currency, economies were restructured to focus on exports as the only source for developing countries to obtain such currency. For the inward-oriented economies it was therefore mandatory to switch their entire production from what was domestically eaten, worn or used towards goods that industrialized countries were interested in. However, as dozens of countries underwent this restructuration process simultaneously and often were told to focus on similar primary goods, the situation resembled a large-scale price war: Developing countries had to compete against each other, causing massive worldwide over-production and deteriorating world market prices. While this was beneficial for Western consumers, developing countries lost 52% of their revenues from exports between 1980 and 1992 because of the decline in prices. Furthermore, debtor states were often encouraged to specialize in a single cash crop, like cocoa in Ghana, tobacco in Zimbabwe and prawns in the Philippines, which made them highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the world market price of these crops. The other main criticism against the compelled integration of developing countries into the global market implied that their industries were not economically or socially stable and therefore not ready to compete internationally. After all, the industrialized countries had engaged in the free trade of goods only after they had developed a more mature industrial structure which they had built up behind high protective tariffs and subsidies for domestic industries. Consequently, the very conditions under which industrialized countries had developed, grown and prospered in the past were now discouraged by the IMF through its SAPs. = Removal of trade and financial barriers = The erosion of the Bretton-Woods- System in 1971 and the end of capital controls caused multinational cooperations (MNCs) to gain access to large sums of capital that they wanted to invest in new markets, such as in developing countries. However, foreign capital could not be freely invested yet because most of these countries protected their nascent industries against it. This changed radically with the implementation of SAPs in the 1980s and 1990s, when controls on foreign exchange and financial protection barriers were lifted: Economies opened up and foreign direct investment (FDI) flowed in en masse. A great example of this is the fall of the local textile industry within many African nations, replaced in part by Chinese counterfeits and knockoffs. The scholars Cardoso and Faletto judged this as yet another way of capitalist control of the Northern industrialized countries, it also brought advantages to local elites and to larger, more profitable companies who expanded in size and influence. However, smaller, less industrialized businesses and the agricultural sector suffered from reduced protection and the growing importance of transnational actors led to a decline in national control over production. Overall, it can be said that the debt crisis of the 1980s provided the IMF with the necessary leverage to impose very similar comprehensive neoliberal reforms in over 70 developing countries, thereby entirely restructuring these economies. The goal was to shift them away from state intervention and inward-oriented development and to transform them into export-led, private sector-driven economies open to foreign imports and FDI. Advantages *Autonomy: During the entire SAL loan process, member countries always have the initiative in policy selection. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are obliged to provide member countries with advice, guidance and policy building, but they have no right to replace members The country ‚Äôs arbitration guarantees the economic autonomy of the member states. *Flexibility. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have always taken flexible measures to avoid rigid lending regulations due to insufficient understanding of a country ‚Äôs situation. For example, taking into account the difficulties and uncertainties in the implementation of long-term policies by a country ‚Äôs domestic government, member countries are usually allowed to amend their adjustment plans. In the initial broad period when the demand for funds is large, the quota of a country is too low compared with its economic scale, and the adjustment plan is effective, the IMF and the World Bank are allowed to break the practice and adjust the specific Quota for loans issued by the state. , *Continuity. Due to the long time required for structural adjustment, the IMF and the World Bank generally prefer to provide a series rather than a loan to ensure the periodicity and continuity of the structural adjustment plan. Therefore, the loan becomes a catalyst for obtaining additional financing. This provides a guarantee for the fundamental structural adjustment of the comprehensive measures of key departments, and avoids the possible adverse effects of the inconsistency of the project loan cycle and the pace of policy reform. *Thoroughness: The purpose of rooting out bad economic performance and supplemented by a series of supporting comprehensive policy measures, although this may make a country pay adjustment costs in the short term, but in the long run, it will definitely help As a country ‚Äôs economy is on track and achieving a virtuous circle, this is precisely the key to the difficulty of obtaining long-term benefits in the past, such as project loans and other forms of loans In addition, SAL also has the advantages of long loan life, low loan interest rate, loose loan conditions, and easy negotiation. Because of this, SAL has been welcomed by many developing countries and has played a role of positive for the improvement of economic conditions in these countries. Criticisms There are multiple criticisms that focus on different elements of SAPs.For another overview, see Towson.edu 's page There are many examples of structural adjustments failing. In Africa, instead of making economies grow fast, structural adjustment actually had a contractive impact in most countries. Economic growth in African countries in the 1980s and 1990s fell below the rates of previous decades. Agriculture suffered as state support was radically withdrawn. After independence of African countries in the 1960s, industrialization had begun in some places, but it was now wiped out. =Undermining national sovereignty= Critics claim that SAPs threaten the sovereignty of national economies because an outside organization is dictating a nation's economic policy. Critics argue that the creation of good policy is in a sovereign nation's own best interest. Thus, SAPs are unnecessary given the state is acting in its best interest. However, supporters consider that in many developing countries, the government will favour political gain over national economic interests; that is, it will engage in rent-seeking practices to consolidate political power rather than address crucial economic issues. In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, political instability has gone hand in hand with gross economic decline. One of the core problems with conventional structural-adjustment programmes is the disproportionate cutting of social spending. When public budgets are slashed, the primary victims are disadvantaged communities who typically are not well organized. An almost classic criticism of structural adjustment is pointing out the dramatic cuts in the education and health sectors. In many cases, governments ended up spending less money on these essential services than on servicing international debts. = Neo-colonialism, neo-imperialism = SAPS are viewed by some postcolonialists as the modern procedure of colonization. By minimizing a government's ability to organise and regulate its internal economy, pathways are created for multinational companies to enter states and extract their resources. Upon independence from colonial rule, many nations that took on foreign debt were unable to repay it, limited as they were to production and exportation of cash crops, and restricted from control of their own more valuable natural resources (oil, minerals) by SAP free-trade and low- regulation requirements. In order to repay interest, these postcolonial countries are forced to acquire further foreign debt, in order to pay off previous interests, resulting in an endless cycle of financial subjugation. Osterhammel's The Dictionary of Human Geography defines colonialism as the \\"enduring relationship of domination and mode of dispossession, usually (or at least initially) between an indigenous (or enslaved) majority and a minority of interlopers (colonizers), who are convinced of their own superiority, pursue their own interests, and exercise power through a mixture of coercion, persuasion, conflict and collaboration\\". The definition adopted by The Dictionary of Human Geography suggests that Washington Consensus SAPs resemble modern, financial colonisation. Investigating Immanuel Kant's conception of liberal internationalism and his opposition to commercial empires, Beate Jahn said: > ... private interests within liberal capitalist states continue to pursue > the opening up of markets abroad, and they continue to enlist their > governments' support, through multilateral and bilateral > arrangements‚Äîconditional aid, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World > Trade Organization (WTO). While the latter agreements are formally > \\"voluntary,\\" in light of the desperate economic dependence of many > developing states, they are to all intents and purposes \\"imposed.\\" Moreover, > the beneficiaries of these agreements-sometimes intentionally so, often > unintentionally-turn out to be the rich countries. The Agreement on Trade- > Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), it has been argued, > turned the WTO into a \\"royalty collection agency\\" for the rich countries. > The Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) connected to IMF loans have proven > singularly disastrous for the poor countries but provide huge interest > payments to the rich.

This policy aims to increase efficiency and investment and to decrease state spending. State-owned resources are to be sold whether they generate a fiscal profit or not.Cardoso and Helwege, \\"Latin America's Economy\\" Cambridge, MA: MIT Press (1992) Critics have condemned these privatization requirements, arguing that when resources are transferred to foreign corporations and/or national elites, the goal of public prosperity is replaced with the goal of private accumulation. Furthermore, state-owned firms may show fiscal losses because they fulfill a wider social role, such as providing low-cost utilities and jobs. Some scholars have argued that SAPs and neoliberal policies have negatively affected many developing countries.McPake, Barbara. 2009. Hospital Policy in Sub-Saharan Africa and Post-Colonial Development Impasse. Soc Hist Med 22 (2):341-360. =Austerity= Critics hold SAPs responsible for much of the economic stagnation that has occurred in the borrowing countries. SAPs emphasize maintaining a balanced budget, which forces austerity programs. The casualties of balancing a budget are often social programs. For example, if a government cuts education funding, universality is impaired, and therefore long-term economic growth. Similarly, cuts to health programs have allowed diseases such as AIDS to devastate some areas' economies by destroying the workforce. A 2009 book by Rick Rowden entitled The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism: How the IMF has Undermined Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS claims that the IMF's monetarist approach towards prioritizing price stability (low inflation) and fiscal restraint (low budget deficits) was unnecessarily restrictive and has prevented developing countries from being able to scale up long-term public investment as a percentage of GDP in the underlying public health infrastructure. The book claims the consequences have been chronically underfunded public health systems, leading to dilapidated health infrastructure, inadequate numbers of health personnel, and demoralizing working conditions that have fueled the \\"push factors\\" driving the brain drain of nurses migrating from poor countries to rich ones, all of which has undermined public health systems and the fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries. A counter-argument is that it is illogical to assume that reducing funding to a program automatically reduces its quality. There may be factors within these sectors that are susceptible to corruption or over-staffing that causes the initial investment to not be used as efficiently as possible. Recent studies have shown strong connections between SAPs and tuberculosis rates in developing nations.New York Times: Rise in TB Is Linked to Loans From I.M.F Countries with native populations living traditional lifestyles face with unique challenges in regards to structural adjustment. Authors Ikubolajeh Bernard Logan and Kidane Mengisteab make the case in their article \\"IMF-World Bank Adjustment and Structural Transformation on Sub- Saharan Africa\\" for the ineffectiveness of structural adjustment in part being attributed to the disconnect between the informal sector of the economy as generated by traditional society and the formal sector generated by a modern, urban society. The rural and urban scales and the different needs of each are a factor that usually goes unexamined when analyzing the effects of structural adjustment. In some rural, traditional communities, the absence of landownership and ownership of resources, land tenure, and labor practices due to custom and tradition provides a unique situation in regard to the structural economic reform of a state. Kinship-based societies, for example, operate under the rule that collective group resources are not to serve individual purposes. Gender roles and obligations, familial relations, lineage, and household organization all play a part in the functioning of traditional society. It would then appear difficult to formulate effective economic reform policies by considering only the formal sector of society and the economy, leaving out more traditional societies and ways of life.Bernard, Ikubolajeh Logan and Kidane Mengisteab. \\"IMF-World Bank Adjustment and Structural Transformation on Sub-Saharan Africa\\". Economic Geography. Vol 69. No 1, African Development. 1993. Print. IMF SAPs versus World Bank SAPs While both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank loan to depressed and developing countries, their loans are intended to address different problems. The IMF mainly lends to countries that have balance of payment problems (they can not pay their international debts), while the World bank offers loans to fund particular development projects. However, the World Bank also provides balance of payments support, usually through adjustment packages jointly negotiated with the IMF. =IMF SAPs= IMF loans focus on temporarily fixing problems that countries face as a whole. Traditionally IMF loans were meant to be repaid in a short duration between 2¬Ω and 4 years. Today, there are a few longer term options available, which go up to 7 years,See the IMF website on lending. as well as options that lend to countries in times of crises such as natural disasters or conflicts. Donor countries The IMF is supported solely by its member states, while the World Bank funds its loans with a mix of member contributions and corporate bonds. Currently there are 185 Members of the IMF (As Of February 2007) and 184 members of the World Bank. Members are assigned a quota to be reevaluated and paid on a rotating schedule. The assessed quota is based upon the donor country's portion of the world economy. One of the critiques of SAPs is that the highest donating countries hold too much influence over which countries receive the loans and the SAPs that accompany them. However, the largest donor only holds 18% of the votes.

The experimental discovery of the negative ion of calcium was motivated by her theoretical prediction of its existence. This was the first known anion of a Group 2 element., Its discovery was cited in Froese Fischer's election to Fellow of the American Physical Society. Early life Charlotte Froese was born on September 21, 1929, in the village of Pravdivka (formerly Nikolayevka), in the Donetsk region, in the present-day Ukraine, to parents of Mennonite descent. Her parents immigrated to Germany in 1929 on the last train allowed to cross the border before its closure by Soviet authorities. After a few months in a refugee camp, her family was allowed to immigrate to Canada, where they eventually established themselves in Chilliwack, British Columbia. Education and research She obtained both a B.A. degree, with honors, in Mathematics and Chemistry and an M.A. degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of British Columbia in 1952 and 1954, respectively. She then obtained her Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Computing at Cambridge University in 1957, pursuing coursework in quantum theory with Paul Dirac. She worked under the supervision of Douglas Hartree, whom she assisted in programming the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) for atomic-structure calculations. She served on the mathematics faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1957 till 1968, where she introduced numerical analysis and computer courses into the curriculum and was instrumental in the formation of the Computer Science Department.Fischer at EDSACFroese Fischer spent 1963-64 at the Harvard College Observatory, where she extended her research on atomic-structure calculations. While at Harvard, she was the first woman scientist to be awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship. In 1991 she became a Fellow of the American Physical Society, in part for her contribution to the discovery of negative calcium. In 1995 she was elected a member of the Royal Physiographic Society in Lund, in 2004 a foreign member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, and in 2015 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Technology from Malm√∂ University, Sweden. Contributions Froese Fischer is the author of over 300 research articles on computational atomic theory, many of which have had far-reaching impact in the area of atomic-structure calculations. The early version of the MCHF program, published in the first volume of Computer Physics Communications received two Citation Classics Awards in 1987. She authored an influential monograph on Hartree-Fock approaches to the first-principles calculation of atomic structure, and coauthored a substantial successor work. One of her largest efforts in the field is the calculation of the complete lower spectra of the beryllium-like to argon-like isoelectronic sequences, amounting to the publication of data covering 400 journal pages and a total of over 150 ions. . . She also authored a scientific biography of her Ph.D. thesis advisor, Douglas Hartree. Froese Fischer is currently an emerita research professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University and a Guest Scientist in the Atomic Spectroscopy Group at NIST. She is the widow of Patrick C. Fischer, himself a noted computer scientist and former professor at Vanderbilt.. An autobiographical account of her own life up to the year 2000 was published in Molecular Physics, and a biographical review of her scientific work up to 2019 has been published in Atoms.
