All 79 students were released without ransom or prior notification on November 7, while the principal and the staff members were held for five more days. The circumstances of the incident remained unclear. While the kidnappers identified as \\"Amba Boys\\" (a common noun for Ambazonian separatists), separatist groups claimed the incident was a false flag operation staged by the Cameroonian government. Background Since 2017, Ambazonian separatists have attacked and burnt down schools across Southern Cameroons. At least 42 schools came under attack between February 2017 and May 2018.Burning Cameroon: Images you're not meant to see, BBC, Jun 25, 2018. Accessed Jun 25, 2018. Separatists regard schools to be legitimate targets because the French language is taught as a mandatory subject, and have warned parents to keep their children at home for their own safety's sake. Attacks on schools have involved destruction of property and abduction of staff, and the purpose of these attacks is to force schools to shut down.Schools Fail to Open in Cameroon's Restive English-speaking Regions, Reliefweb, Sep 4, 2018. Accessed Sep 4, 2018. Kidnapping According to students who were kidnapped, armed men woke them up at 3 a.m., had them sit down in front of the school, and then made their selection. 79 students, a principal and three staff members were taken into the bush, then marched to Bafut, bypassing numerous security checkpoints that operate in and around Bamenda.Cameroon kidnapped student speaks after release, Africa News, Nov 9, 2018. Accessed Nov 9, 2018. The students were between the ages of 11 and 17. The following day, Cameroonian authorities announced that the military would be sent to find and free the students. These searches were unsuccessful.Cameroon vows to rescue abductees, the East African, Nov 6, 2018. Accessed Nov 7, 2018. On November 7, all 79 students were released, while the principal and three staff members remained under captivity. On November 12, the remaining captives were released too. Although the Cameroonian authorities had been unable to locate the students, they nevertheless took some credit for the release, claiming the kidnappers gave up due to fears of being surrounded. Purpose of the kidnapping According to a Presbyterian minister who was involved in negotiations, no ransom was demanded. The kidnappers wanted the school to close down, as part of the school boycott declared by separatists the year before. Students who were kidnapped said the kidnappers told them to stop going to school, and tasked them with conveying the message to other students. Although the details of the negotiations have not been released, the school was closed following the incident. According to a spokesperson of the Ambazonia Self-Defence Council, the kidnappers had nothing to do with the separatist cause. Separatists claimed they had sent their own fighters to go search for the students, and alleged that the whole affair was staged by the Cameroonian government to smear the separatists. Commenting on a video that was released by the kidnappers, they claimed to recognize one of the kidnappers as a French-speaking man from Yaound√©.

Taxonomy The four-horned chameleon was first described in 1899 by the naturalist Gustav Tornier. There are three subspecies, including the nominate. * T. q. quadricornis ‚Äì southern four- horned chameleon * T. q. eisentrauti ‚Äì Eisentraut's chameleon * T. q. gracilior ‚Äì northern four-horned chameleon Distribution and habitat The four-horned chameleon is found only in some highland areas associated with the Cameroon line across Cameroon and eastern Nigeria; its range includes the Western High Plateau, the Bamboutos massif, Mount Manengouba, Oku Massif, the Bakossi Mountains including Mount Kupe, and the Obudu Plateau in Nigeria. T. q. eisentrauti in particular is endemic to the Rumpi Hills of Cameroon. Overall, T. quadricornis has an extent of occurrence of 13,300 km2 and an inferred area of occupancy of 1,000 km2. The species is primarily associated with relatively intact montane forest with limited human activity, where it has a relatively restricted elevational range (1150 to 2400 metres). Research suggests that this is likely to reflect competition with other chameleon species rather than physiological tolerances. The type locality for the species is Mount Manegouba in Cameroon. A female four-horned chameleon of the subspecies T. q. eisentrauti Description and behavior Like many other chameleons, the four-horned chameleon has a prehensile tail and single claws on its toes. It usually has four prominent horns, but sometimes two are present with up to four adjacent reduced horns; adults typically grow to a length of 10 to 14 inches. Male four-horned chameleons have a prominent hemipenal bulge and a gular beard, while some female four-horned chameleons have one horn or even two horns on the tip of the snout. The species almost exclusively feeds on arthropods. Conservation and threats Because of its small and fragmented range coupled with numerous threats to its population, the four-horned chameleon is ranked Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are concerns that logging and agricultural expansion may contribute to deforestation and potentially threaten the status of the species by degrading its habitat; in addition, despite its status as a protected Class A species in Cameroon, its intensive exploitation by the pet trade has caused significant population declines in some cases.

The community is northeast of Freeport. History Clinton was founded in a deep southeastern bend of the Allegheny River by Enos McBride as 75 lots which were surveyed in July, 1830. Water street, about 80 feet wide, extended the whole length of the town along the river. Washington, Franklin, Jackson, Olinda, and Liberty streets, whose courses are from east to west, are intersected at right angles by First, Second and Third streets, each 60 feet wide, which run north to south. The 24 upper lots appear like a separate plat, and are traversed by Fourth and Fifth streets, whose bearing is northwest, which are intersected by two unnamed streets, one now named River Road, whose bearing is northeast, each 40 feet wide. The lots and streets cover an area of about 29 acres. McBride sold most if not all of his lots, though deeds for only a few of them are on record. The first separate assessment list was in 1834, which included lots from No. 1 to 60 inclusive, assessed to almost as many persons, of which only eleven are noted as improved. The following sales show the prices of the lots in various parts of the town: On June 27, 1832, McBride conveyed to James Stewart, lot No. 9, fronting on Washington, Franklin, Second streets, for $60; to Johnathan Porter, No. 28, fronting on Jackson and Olinda streets, between Second and Third, for $15; to Patrick Sherry, Nos. 35 and 37, fronting on Olinda and Liberty, between First and Second streets, for $11 and $10.

The statue is used as an informal flood marker for the level of the River Seine in Paris. Background An arch bridge over the Seine was first constructed at this location in Paris in the 1850s, connecting the Avenue George V (formerly the Avenue d'Alma) to the Quai d'Orsay and Quai Branly. The new bridge was named after the 1854 Battle of Alma in the Crimean War. The two supporting piers of the bridge in the river were decorated with military sculptures, one on each side of each pier. Each of the four sculptures depicts a French soldier from the Crimean War: a Zouave and a grenadier by Georges Diebolt, and a chasseur and an artilleryman by Auguste Arnaud. Three of the four statues on the Pont de l'Alma were removed and relocated when the bridge was reconstructed as a wider girder bridge in the 1970s, but The Zouave was reinstalled on the new bridge, although in a somewhat lower position. File:Chasseur a pied.jpg by Arnaud, now at the Redoute de Gravelle, in the Bois de Vincennes File:L'artilleur √† F√®re.jpg by Arnaud, Artilleur von Auguste Arnaud, now in La F√®re, Aisne File:Diebolt - le grenadier .jpg by Diebolt, in Dijon, birthplace of its sculptor Description The French Zouave wears the traditional uniform based on the styles of clothing worn in North Africa in the early 1800s, with a short open-fronted jacket, sashes, and baggy trousers (sirwal) gathered above the ankle. The figure has removed its fez, and is resting on a grounded rifle. The statue is high and weighs 8 tonnes. It is said to have been modelled on Andr√©-Louis Gody. The Zouave statue is used as an informal flood marker in Paris: the footpaths along the embankments beside the Seine were usually closed when the level of the river reached the feet of The Zouave, and the river was unnavigable by the time it reached his thighs. At the time of the 1910 Great Flood of Paris, the floodwater reached his shoulders. The official point for measuring the level of the river is now at the Pont d'Austerlitz: before 1876 it was at Pont de la Tournelle.

The bronze sculpture was one of Remington's most popular, after The Broncho Buster, and it has been described as Remington's own favorite sculpture. The work depicts a cowboy riding a horse that is rearing up in fright, twisting away from a rattlesnake on the base. The rider, with moustache and woolly chaps, leans forward, gripping the horse's mane with one hand and holding on to his hat with the other. Remington completed a plaster model in January 1905, which was cast in bronze by the Roman Bronze Works using the lost wax process. Eleven bronzes had been cast from this first model, high, by 1908, when Remington became dissatisfied with the original design. Over a period of ten days, Remington reworked the plaster model. The revisions increased the tension of its pose by changing the position of the horse's legs, tucking in its forelegs and straightening the rear legs, and also increased the fluid curvature of the piece by moving the rider's stance further forward. The changes added about to its height. Around 100 authorised casts were made of the new version before 1921, but many unauthorised posthumous casts were made later by the Roman Bronze Works. An example is held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art which measures , bequeathed by Jacob Ruppert in 1939. An example was sold by Christie's in 2009 for US$134,500, and another in 2011 for US$92,500 A cast was displayed in the Oval Office by US Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W.

Its remains have been found in the Miocene of Belgium, France, Germany and Malta, the Pliocene of Belgium and France, and the Pleistocene of the United Kingdom and South Carolina. Dentition The teeth of Hoplocetus are massive (95-150 mm in length; 27-47 in maximum diameter), robust and have a short enamel cap on the crowns. They are somewhat larger than those of modern orcas but considerably smaller than those of macroraptorial sperm whales, such as Zygophyseter, as well as those of Scaldicetus caretti. They display a large degree of abrasion, suggesting a highly predatory niche comparable to that of modern orcas. The genus of the latter, Orcinus, first appears in the middle Pliocene and it may have eventually replaced Hoplocetus. These teeth features also characterize the other extinct toothed whale genera, Diaphorocetus, Idiorophus and Scaldicetus, sometimes placed with Hoplocetus in the subfamily Hoplocetinae. However, some of these taxa are fragmentary and have been used as wastebasket taxa for non- diagnostic material of stem physeteroids.

Background and education  Tie's family moved from China to Canada when she was four years old. Her father has a master's degree in chemical engineering, but she describes both parents as \\"entrepreneurs.\\" Growing up in Mississauga, Ontario, she attended the Glenforest Secondary School (International Baccalaureate Diploma Program). At 15, she worked on an immunology project with researchers at the University of Toronto, work that was published the next year in the Canadian Young Scientist Journal as a single-author manuscript. Further research using yeast as a gene variant model was published by a larger team in 2018. During her first year as an undergraduate at the University of Toronto, Tie worked at Mount Sinai Hospital, in the genetic research laboratory of Frederick Roth. After hearing about a competition for a biotech startup, she teamed up with Leo Wan, a graduate student in Roth's lab, to create a business plan for a genomics start-up. They later presented their business plan to IndieBio, an accelerator run by SOSV, who gave them $100,000 of funding. Tie took a leave of absence in 2014 after less than a year of college to work on the project in San Francisco with IndieBio. In 2015, Tie was one of only four Canadians to win a Thiel Fellowship, which encourages college undergraduates to leave college and instead further their education by building a startup company. Ranomics Tie founded Ranomics as its CEO in 2015. In a JLabs profile, Tie explained that the company's focus was to investigate variants of unknown significance (VUS) that caused genetic tests to fail or misdiagnose patients. Ranomics worked for external genetic testing firms in a business-to-business arrangement to analyze oncogene mutations. Tie and her partner eventually partnered lead product VariantFind with Science Exchange to provide variant analysis on their online platform.

Los Angeles Times 22 Jan 1969: i11 A. I. Bezzerides also worked on the script. ABC were reluctant to finance the feature after the box office failure of Aldrich's last film about Hollywood, The Legend of Lylah Clare. Aldrich decided to make a \\"long trailer\\" for the film, a 20-minute short to encourage them to provide the money. In particular, he wanted to demonstrate the ability of the girl he wanted to play the lead, Alexandra Hay. \\"She carries the picture,\\" he said. It was only the second time Aldrich tested for one of his pictures, the first being Ursula Andress and Richard Jaeckel on 4 for Texas (1963).\\"$75,000 SCREEN TEST SCHEDULED BY ALDRICH\\" Los Angeles Times 26 July 1969: a9 Filming started in July 1969. There were two days of rehearsals and eight days of filming - five days of interiors at the Aldrich Studios and three days of exteriors at Zuma Beach, the Los Angeles Zoo, Sunset Strip and Griffith Park. The budget was given for $75,000. Aldrich said he deliberately used \\"very stylistic sets\\" to \\"reassure\\" the cast that \\"not one inch of this test footage would wind up in the movie.\\" The film did not succeed in attracting finance for a feature. Aldrich said in 1972 they made the movie \\"just at the time that everybody was getting very sanctimonious about sex pictures... I think it's pretty good. But nobody wanted this thing about a broken-down Hollywood director who found a 16 year old girl and shacked up with her and had a heart attack, etc. We spent $90,000 getting it mounted to show people what it was all about, which I thought was an ingenious piece of showmanship, but nobody else agreed with me. I also think that it was very stupid timing. If I had been bright enough, I would have known that the cycle had passed. Whereas a year before that picture would have sold like hotcakes. So no more war pictures and no more \\"Hollywood\\" pictures for a while. I'm a sucker for them. I can't find any; and I'm trying not to look.\\"\\"Mr. film noir stays at the table\\" Silver, Alain.

Retrieved 2019-11-21 The concept of digital redlining is an extension of the practice of redlining in housing discrimination,Podesta, John; Penny, Pritzker; Moniz, Earnest, J.; Holdren, John; Zients, Jeffery (May 2014). \\"Big Data: Seizing Opportunities, Preserving Values\\" Whitehouse.gov. Retrieved December 18, 2018 a historical legal practice in the United States and Canada dating back to the 1930s where red lines were drawn on maps to indicate poor and primarily black neighborhoods that were deemed unsuitable for loans or further development; this created great economic disparities between neighborhoods. Dr. Chris Gilliard, a privacy scholar, defined digital redlining as \\"the creation and maintenance of tech practices, policies, pedagogies, and investment decisions that enforce class boundaries and discriminate against specific groups\\".Eveleth, R. (2020). Flash Forward [Audio Podcast]. Boss Bot. https://www.flashforwardpod.com/2020/09/29/boss-bot/ Though digital redlining is related to the digital divide and techniques such as weblining and personalization, it is distinct from these concepts as part of larger complex systemic issues. It can refer to practices that create inequities of access to technology services in geographical areas, such as when internet service providers decide to not service specific geographic areas because they are perceived to be not as profitable and thus reduce access to crucial services and civic participation. It can also be used to refer to inequities caused by the policies and practices of digital technologies. For instance, with these methods inequities are accomplished through divisions that are created via algorithms which are hidden from the technology user; the use of big data and analytics allow for a much more nuanced form of discrimination that can target specific vulnerable populations. These algorithmic means are enabled through the use of unregulated data technologies that apply a score to individuals that statistically categorize personality traits or tendencies which are similar to a credit score but are proprietary to the technology companies and not under outside oversight.  Digital redlining and geography  While the roots of redlining lie in excluding populations based on geography, digital redlining occurs in both geographical and non-geographical contexts. An example of both contexts can be found in the charges brought against Facebook on March 28 of 2019, by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD charged Facebook with violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 by \\"encouraging, enabling, and causing housing discrimination through the company's advertising platform.\\" HUD stated that Facebook allowed advertisers to ‚Äúexclude people who live in a specified area from seeing an ad by drawing a red line around that area.‚Äù The discrimination called out by HUD included those that were racist, homophobic, ableist, and classist. Besides this example of geographically based digital redlining, HUD also charged that Facebook used profile information and designations to exclude classes of people. The charges stated: \\"Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people whom Facebook classified as parents; non-American-born; non-Christian; interested in accessibility; interested in Hispanic culture; or a wide variety of other interests that closely align with the Fair Housing Act‚Äôs protected classes\\" Several media outlets pointed out HUDs own history of housing discrimination through redlining, the establishment of the Fair Housing Act to combat redlining, and how the digital platform was recreating this discriminatory practice. = Digital redlining within a geographical context = Although digital redlining refers to a complex and varied set of practices, it has been most commonly applied to practices with a geographical dimension. Common examples include when an internet service providers decide to not service specific geographic areas because those areas are seen to be not as profitable, resulting in discrimination against low-income communities, with resulting impacts on access to crucial services and civic participation. AT&T; has faced specific scrutiny for this form of digital redlining, it has been reported that AT&T; has been classist in its offerings of broadband internet service in areas that are more impoverished. Geographically based digital redlining can also apply to digital content or the distribution of goods sold online. Geographically based games such as Pok√©mon Go have been shown to offer more virtual stops and rewards in geographic areas that are less ethnically and racially diverse. In 2016, Amazon was rebuked for not offering their Prime same-day delivery service to many communities that were largely African American and had incomes that were beneath the national average. Even services such as email can be impacted, with many email administrators creating filters for flagging particular email messages as spam based on the geographical origin of the message. = Digital redlining outside of a geographical context = Although often aligned with discrimination that falls into a geographically based context; not all digital redlining is geographically based. Digital redlining also refers to when vulnerable populations are targeted for or excluded from specific content or access to the internet in a way that harms them. Trade schools and community colleges, which typically have a more working class student body, have been found to block public internet content from their students where elite research institutions do not. The use of big data and analytics allow for a much more nuanced form of discrimination that can target specific vulnerable populations. For example, Facebook has been criticized for providing tools that allow advertisers to target ads by ethnic affinity and gender, effectively blocking minorities from seeing specific ads for housing and employment. In October 2019, a major class action lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging gender and age discrimination in financial advertising. A broad array of consumers can be particularly vulnerable to digital redlining when it is used outside of a geographical context. Besides targeting vulnerable populations based on traditional and legally recognized classifications such as race, gender, age, etc., it has been shown that personal data mined and then resold by brokers can be used to target those who have been identified as suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia, or simply identified as impulse buyers or gullible.Pasquale, Frank (2017-11-17). \\"Algorithms: How Companies‚Äô Decisions About Data and Content Impact Consumers‚Äù Written Testimony of Frank Pasquale Professor of Law University of Maryland Before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection. Retrieved 2018-11-14  Term distinctions = Distinctions between weblining and digital redlining = Earlier distinctions have been made between weblining‚Äîthe process of charging customers different prices based on profile information --- and internet or digital redlining, with digital redlining being focused not on pricing but access. As early as 2002 the Gale Encyclopedia of E-Commerce puts forth the distinction more in use today: weblining is the pervasive and generally accepted (or at least tolerated) practice of personalizing access to products and services in ways invisible to the user; digital redlining is when such personalized, data-driven schemes perpetuate traditional advantages of privileged demographics. As weblining has become more ubiquitous, the term has fallen out of use in favor of the more general term personalization. = Distinctions between the digital divide and digital redlining = Scholars have often drawn connections between the digital divide and digital redlining.Prieger, James E.

It was first published in 1897 when it was hailed by critics as one of the best novels dealing with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. It is divided into five books of six chapters each (except Book II which has seven). The novel is based heavily on research that Flora Annie Steel conducted in India, to the extent that Steel often provided the accurate hour, date, and weather of important historical events that interweave through the plot and characters of the novel. She was able to secure access from government officials to previously confidential records about the Indian Rebellion. She wrote in her autobiography that it was like ‚Äúdigging for gold, uncertain each instant if some priceless treasure would not turn up. And there was a breathless haste, an inevitable hurry about it, almost as if the spirit of the times had been caught and prisoned in the papers‚Äù. Plot introduction On the Face of the Waters unfolds during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The narrative shifts among three different points of view: the royal family of Delhi, the native Indian soldiers and their allies, and the English army that takes Delhi. The male protagonist, Jim Douglas, a former soldier, has been living with a former dancing girl Zora who he had \\"saved\\" months before and is now pregnant by him. Zora though soon dies, and Douglas is recruited to be a British spy. The female protagonist, Kate Erlton, at the beginning of the novel, is living the normal life of a colonial wife of her husband Major Erlton. When the rebellion erupts, she is forced to confront the dangerous reality of being isolated in the middle of major colonial rebellion. She finds out that her husband has been having a public affair with Alice Gissing. And when rebels attack the house Kate is visiting, Jim Douglas rescues her, though Alice Gissing is murdered while attempting to rescue an English child. When Douglas can't safely return Kate to friendly territory, he moves her to the heart of the hostile city, setting up a fake household with her as they pose as a Muslim Afghani family. While there, Kate is left to spend most of her time alone on the rooftop, away from eyes while Jim goes out daily to scout the city while posing as a trader. While being stuck behind the house's walls, Kate befriends Tara, her Indian maidservant, and adopts Indian customs and learns Hindustani. Major Erlton, still with the army, is mortally wounded in battle. As the rebellion ends, Kate finds out of her husband's death, and is allowed to start a new life with Jim.

Killing approximately 1/3 of the entire Japanese population, the epidemic had significant social, economic, and religious repercussions throughout the country. Origins A few decades prior to the outbreak, Japanese court officials had adopted the Chinese policy of reporting disease outbreaks among the general population. This recording practice greatly facilitated the identification of smallpox as the disease that afflicted Japan during the years 735‚Äì737. Increased contact between Japan and the Asian mainland had led to more frequent and serious outbreaks of infectious diseases. The smallpox epidemic of 735-737 was recorded as having taken hold around August 735 in the city of Dazaifu, Fukuoka in northern Kyushu, where the infection had ostensibly been carried by a Japanese fisherman who had contracted the illness after being stranded on the Korean peninsula. The disease spread rapidly throughout northern Kyushu that year, and persisted into the next. By 736, many land tenants in Kyushu were either dying or forsaking their crops, leading to poor agricultural yields and ultimately famine. Also, in 736, a group of Japanese governmental officials passed through northern Kyushu while the epidemic was intensifying. As members of the party sickened and died, the group gave up on their intended mission to the Korean peninsula. Returning to the capital with smallpox, the officials supposedly had spread the disease to eastern Japan and Nara. The disease continued to ravage Japan in 737. One manifestation of the pandemic's great impact was that by August of 737, a tax exemption had been extended to all of Japan. Based on fiscal reports, adult mortality for the smallpox epidemic of 735‚Äì737 has been estimated at 25%-35% of Japan's entire population, with some areas experiencing much higher rates. All levels of society were affected. Many court nobles perished due to smallpox in 737, including all four brothers of the politically powerful Fujiwara clan: Fujiwara no Muchimaro (680-737), Fujiwara no Fusasaki (681-737), Fujiwara no Umakai (694-737), and Fujiwara no Maro (695-737). Their sudden departure from the royal court allowed for the ascension of noted rival Tachibana no Moroe to a high official position in the court of Emperor Sh≈çmu. The epidemic not only killed a large segment of the population, it triggered significant dislocation, migration, and imbalance of the labor throughout Japan. Highly affected were construction and farming, especially rice cultivation. Aftermath The Daibutsuden at T≈çdai-ji In addition to the granting of tax waivers, Japan's nobles took other unprecedented actions in response to the effects of the epidemic to help stem widespread population migration and to reinvigorate the farming communities. For example, several years after the smallpox epidemic had run its course, the Japanese leaders attempted to stimulate agricultural productivity by offering private land ownership to those willing to work farmland. Also around this time Emperor Sh≈çmu, who felt personally responsible for the tragedy, greatly increased the official support of Buddhism by commissioning the construction of the grand temple T≈çdai-ji and its Daibutsu, and provided significant financial support for the construction of other provincial temples (the ), statues, and related religious structures throughout the country. The cost to cast the Daibutsu alone has been said to have nearly bankrupted the country. Over the next several centuries, Japan continued to experience smallpox epidemics. But by the early part of the 2nd millennium, smallpox had become endemic to the Japanese population and thus less devastating during outbreaks.

After forming, it was assigned to the 30th Army of Western Front, served briefly in the defense of Moscow, and played a role in the liberation of Klin, and later in the near- encirclement of the German 9th Army around Rzhev in the winter counteroffensive of 1941-42. In late January, 1942, it was transferred to the 29th Army of Kalinin Front, which was very soon after encircled by German forces near Sychevka, and on March 18 the division was disbanded due to very heavy losses. In November, 1944, a new 365th Rifle Division was formed in the Far Eastern Front, based on the 29th Rifle Brigade, and saw action in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August, 1945, being awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its services. 1st Formation The division began forming on September 1, 1941 in the Urals Military DistrictWalter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 in the Sverdlovsk Oblast. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1211th Rifle Regiment * 1213th Rifle Regiment * 1215th Rifle Regiment * 927th Artillery Regiment Col. Matvei Aleksandrovich Shchukin was assigned to command of the division on the day it began forming. It spent nearly three months in the Urals forming and training, but was still far from complete when it was sent west in late November. When it reached the front it had only 30 of the 104 medium and heavy mortars authorized, was lacking nearly 100 trucks, was short of antitank guns and had no sapper (engineer) battalion organized at all.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, pp. 95-96 By the end of November 30 the division had arrived as a reinforcement, along with the 82nd Cavalry Division, for the 30th Army, in Western Front. By the morning of December 3 the Army's units were completing a partial regrouping, facing the German 86th Infantry and 36th Motorized Divisions and an SS brigade; the 365th was concentrated in the area 20 km east of Konakovo.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., Part III, ch. 3 On the morning of December 6, as ordered by Western Front, 30th Army went over to the offensive, overcoming stubborn German resistance. The Army's main blow was aimed at Klin, with the 365th, backed by 8th Tank Brigade, commanded by Col. P. A. Rotmistrov, and 371st Rifle Division, supported by 21st Tank Brigade. By the end of the day this attack liberated the area of Borshchevo. The offensive continued over the next two days and was threatening to cut the Klin - Leningrad road and envelop the city from the northeast. The defending German 7th Panzer and 14th Motorized Divisions were by now falling back. On the morning of December 12 the 365th and the 8th Tank Brigade were counterattacked out of Klin and Vysokovsk by the two motorized divisions, supported by 40 tanks and aerial attacks, forcing them to pull back to the southern edge of the woods north of Golyadi, Polukhanovo and Maidanovo. Over the next three days the Soviet objective was to encircle Klin to destroy the German forces defending it, but cooperation between 30th and 1st Shock Armies was difficult to maintain. In the end, most of the defenders were able to withdraw, with heavy losses, and the city was liberated on December 15 by the 371st and 365th Divisions and their supporting troops. From December 9 to 15 the two Armies captured 82 tanks, 18 armored cars, 750 cars and trucks, 80 guns, 120 mortars, 250 machine guns, 800 submachine guns, up to 10,000 shells, and about 2 million small arms rounds.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., Part IV, ch. 2 Shortly after, 30th Army was transferred to Kalinin Front. Even facing the weakened German forces during this campaign, Soviet losses were high due to little effective artillery support and lack of expertise; by the turn of the year the rifle divisions of Kalinin Front averaged less than 3,700 men.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 96 Beginning on January 8, 1942, this Army took part in the Sychevka-Vyasma Offensive Operation, which was planned \\"to encircle, and then capture or destroy the enemy's entire Mozhaisk - Gzhatsk - Vyasma grouping\\",Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, ed. & trans.

At the end of January the 365th was transferred to the 29th Army, still in Kalinin Front, attacking towards Sychevka. Within days forces of the German 9th Army encircled 29th Army. Over the next six weeks the Army struggled behind enemy lines, attempting to reestablish communications or at least to break out. On March 15 Colonel Shchukin left command of the division to Col. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vetlugin, but on March 18 the 365th was officially disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 96 2nd Formation On November 15, 1944, a new 365th was formed, this time based on the 2nd formation of the 29th Rifle Brigade.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 129 =29th Rifle Brigade=1st Formation This brigade began forming for the first time at Gorkii in the Moscow Military District in October, 1941.Dunn states it formed in November; Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 88 It was based on a cadre of reserve (training) units from the Siberian Military District.

In recognition of this and its other exploits in the early stages of the counteroffensive, the 29th was redesignated as the 1st Guards Rifle Brigade on January 2, 1942.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XI, Nafziger, 1996, pp. 20-21 In the summer of that year this brigade would be formed into the 42nd Guards Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IV, Nafziger, 1995, p. 97 2nd Formation A new 29th Rifle Brigade was formed in July, 1942, in the 59th Rifle Corps of the 1st Red Banner Army of the Far Eastern Front. It remained under those headquarters through until late 1944. In preparation for the coming offensive against the Japanese forces in Manchuria a series of new rifle divisions were being formed in the far east, and from November 26 to 15 December the 29th Brigade was officially disbanded and reorganized as the new 365th Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", p. 21.

The division was still in 59th Corps when the Soviet invasion of Manchuria began in August, 1945.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 129 It advanced behind the 39th Rifle Division on the right flank of the army in the corps second echelon from 10 August, crossing the Muling River. After the 39th and a tank brigade captured Linkou on 13 August, the 365th was tasked with driving elements of the Japanese 365th Infantry Regiment of the 135th Division from positions north of Linkou, which was accomplished by 17 August. On September 19, 1945, the division was recognized for its service in the campaign with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. Along with the 35th Army headquarters, it was ordered disbanded in late September 1945 in accordance with the order that established the Primorsky Military District.

It was a hotblast, steam charcoal furnace, ten feet across the bosh-stack and thirty-three feet high. It made its first pig-metal in July, 1846. It used charcoal until 1863, when the height of the stack was increased to forty feet and the fixtures were improved; and then commenced making iron with coke in 1865. The capacity of the furnace was fifty-six tons of forge metal out of limestone ore from beds in the coal measures for miles around. In 1869 Brown & Mosgrove built a three- foot gauge railroad from the north of Pine creek to the furnace, a distance of four miles, for transporting ore and metal from and to the Allegheny Valley Railroad, which proved to be very successful. It is designated on the township map the Pine Creek & Dayton Railroad, so named because the people of the borough of Dayton and of the valley of Pine creek, had evinced considerable interest in its extension to Dayton, but without having secured the requisite pecuniary means. Subscriptions reaching $30,000, one-half the required amount, were made for this purpose in 1871. A post office called Pine Creek Furnace was established in 1872. It remained in operation until 1882.

Description The Patagonian squid is a small species and has a mantle length of and a weight of between . The mantle is somewhat elongated and on either side at the posterior end are rhomboidal fins, rather less than half the length of the mantle. At the anterior end are four pairs of arms and a pair of tentacles. The third and fourth pairs of arms are longer than the others, and in males, the left fourth arm is heterodactylised near its tip. The tentacles are long and slender, each terminated by a club-shaped \\"manus\\" with small, narrow suckers at the edge and slightly larger ones at the centre. Distribution This squid occurs in the southeastern Pacific Ocean and the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. In the Pacific its range extends along the coast from southern Peru to southern Chile, and in the Atlantic, from the San Mat√≠as Gulf in Argentina southwards to Tierra del Fuego, including the continental shelf around the Falkland Islands. It is an open-water species with a depth range from the surface down to about . Biology Little is known of the biology of this species, but like all squid, it is a predator. Prey items are caught by the tentacles, grasped and moved to the mouth with the help of the arms, and then chewed by the horny beak. In Chile, spawning grounds have been identified at depths of between . Fragile egg masses some long containing about 15 embryos have been found among stems of the kelp Lessonia trabeculata, particularly in places where the algae has been heavily defoliated, suggesting that a semi-protected environment with adequate water movement is desirable. Uses In the Pacific Ocean and off Argentina, this species is mostly caught as bycatch during trawls directed at other species. There is a dedicated fishery in the Falkland Islands where it is an important target species taken from over the Patagonian Shelf. The total reported world catch in 1999 was , with the largest catch being from the Falkland Islands ().

She worked for many years at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where she is University Archivist Emeritus. Education and career Goodstein was born on July 8, 1939, in Brooklyn; both of her parents were college-educated children of Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe, and worked for the city. She went to Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, but left at age 16 to escape its cliquish and competitive atmosphere, and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1960 with a bachelor's degree in history. Her interest in the history of science began at this time, with a graduate-level class she took from Carl Benjamin Boyer, as the only undergraduate in the class. Another faculty mentor at Brooklyn College was John Hope Franklin. She became a junior high school teacher in Borough Park, Brooklyn before applying with her fianc√©, David Goodstein, to graduate schools (she in history, he in physics). On the suggestion of Boyer, she went to the University of Washington, where Harry Woolf was at the time. She was not admitted with financial aid, but Woolf hired her as an assistant. However, he soon moved to another university. She worked with a succession of other professors there, including one who promised to block her graduation because she refused to babysit his children, and successfully defended her Ph.D. in 1968. Her dissertation, Chemical Theory and the Nature of Matter, concerned chemist Humphry Davy, a topic suggested by Satish Kapoor, who also left Washington before she could finish. Her eventual doctoral advisor was Thomas Hankins. She and her husband moved to Caltech in 1966, where she worked as a teacher again while completing her dissertation, with a year in Rome for her husband's postdoctorate. She was hired as Institute Archivist by Daniel Kevles in 1968, also teaching the history of science at California State University, Dominguez Hills from 1969 to 1973 and later at the University of California, Los Angeles. She became University Archivist in 1995, and retired as University Archivist Emeritus in 2009. She has also worked at Caltech as a faculty associate and lecturer, and was registrar from 1989 to 2003.

When adjusted for differences in molecular weight, PE3P contains the equivalent of about 80% of the amount of estriol. As such, 40 mg PE3P corresponds to about 32 mg estriol. Doses of PE3P of 10 mg or more have an extended duration of action. A single intramuscular injection of 80 mg PE3P has a duration of about 1 month and of 80 mg about 2 months. The effects of PE3P on the vagina, uterus, pregnancy, prostate gland, coagulation, and fibrinolysis, as well as on mammary and endometrial cancer risk, have been studied. The endometrial proliferation dose of PE3P over 14 days in women is 40 to 60 mg by intramuscular injection. Chemistry PE3P is a water-soluble polymer of estriol with phosphoric acid. History PE3P was developed by the Swedish pharmaceutical company Leo L√§kemedel AB in the 1960s. It was introduced for medical use by 1968. Society and culture=Brand names= PE3P was marketed under brand names including Gyn√§san, Klimadurin, and Triodurin. =Availability= PE3P was marketed in Germany and Spain.

For a large part of his life, he specialised in producing still lifes, but widened his artistic range following his experiences during World War I and is today recognised as an important Latvian Symbolist. Biography R≈´dolfs Pƒìrle was born in northern Latvia and originally studied to become a gardener. While studying, his talent for drawing still lifes of flowers was discovered and he was encouraged to pursue art studies at the Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy. In 1899 he enrolled in the class of textile design and still life painting, led by his countryman . At the academy, he became friends with other Latvian art students, including Burkards Dzenis, Gustavs ≈†ƒ∑ilters, Pƒìteris Krasti≈Ü≈° and Aleksandrs Romans, and he joined the association of young Latvian artists known as R≈´ƒ∑is. When he had finished his studies, he stayed in Saint Petersburg, having a daytime job in a factory and pursuing his artistic interests in his free time. While not widely recognised in the erstwhile capital of the Russian Empire, his works were exhibited in Riga, the present-day capital of his native Latvia. At the outbreak of World War I, R≈´dolfs Pƒìrle was sent as an expert on military observation balloons by his employer, who manufactured them, to the front in the Caucasus. Encountering the wild and mountainous landscape and the destruction brought by the war provided strong inspiration for Pƒìrle, who in the last years of his life thus came to adopt new and darker themes and modes of expression. He died on 17 June 1917 in Petrograd due to complications after surgery of appendicitis. Art R≈´dolfs Pƒìrle was a painter who used a variety of techniques, from watercolour to ink drawings; he picked up oil painting only as late as 1916. Until then, his oeuvre mostly consisted of still lifes of flowers, but following his impressions during the war, he began an intense production of oneiric, expressive landscapes, characterised by an atmosphere of desolation. He has been compared to his contemporary Lithuanian artist colleague Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis and described as an important representative of Symbolism within Latvian art. In recent years, a double exhibition featuring the works of Pƒìrle and ƒåiurlionis was on display in Riga (2014) and works by R≈´dolfs Pƒìrle also featured in the exhibition √Çmes sauvages. Le symbolisme dans les pays baltes held at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris in 2018.

This sarcophagus, as well as others in the Sidon necropolis, belonged to a succession of kings who ruled in the area of Phoenicia between the mid-5th century BCE to the end of the 4th century BCE.

His Instagram account, featuring videos applying his skills in taekwondo to other sports, such as table tennis, bowling and basketball, has gained a following of 47,500 people on Instagram. His presence in social media was featured on Singaporean newspaper The Straits Times, as one of Singapore's most followed athletes.

Obstacles towards Tokyo 2020 Olympics  In an article by Singaporean community news website Mothership.sg, Ng's obstacles in his bid to compete in the 2020 Olympics Games were detailed. He faced challenges by Singapore's national governing body for Taekwondo, Singapore Taekwondo Federation (STF) who allegedly called his achievements \\"paltry\\". Faced with the lack of support by the STF and a lack of a national team coach for more than a year, Ng had to finding his own opportunities, training with the South Korean, Norwegian and Taiwanese national teams. The STF claimed to have approved a sponsorship of in November 2018 for Ng to take a year away from studies to train full-time. However, STF did not deny that Ng had only been informed of the sponsorship in January 2019 when it was too late to excuse himself from full-time studies. Ng's carding status, which puts him under Sport Singapore's Athlete Support Scheme, had been revoked. The decision was based on various sources such as input by the STF. There was also a delay of his application submission, allegedly due to the STF's failure of a prompt response. Following the articles, other national team athletes have stepped up to share their grievances about their training under STF, including the inadequate coaching and lack of safe avenues for feedback. In a subsequent article by Lianhe Zaobao, it was further revealed that with the lack of adequate financial support from the STF over the years, Ng's father was resigned to fund Ng's aspirations, spending in excess of over the years. Furthermore, Ng claimed the STF also tried excusing themselves of fault by claiming that Ng's father could afford it. When confronted, the STF denied this, but was contradicted with a validated transcript, which stated clearly that they did indeed make such a statement. = Resolution = It was reported that international governing body, World Taekwondo (WT) had found evidence of Lim Teong Chin (then General Manager of STF) and Wong Liang Ming (then Secretary General of STF) in violation of several articles in the WT code of ethics.

WT also place the STF under preliminary suspension as its affiliate, and sought the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) to review the situation. The SNOC suspended the STF as its affiliate as well. Wong and Lim had since left the STF. The SNOC appointed to an interim committee to oversee the STF and implement recommendations made by SNOC and WT to improve the management of the association.

Pathophysiology  The typical human adult's nerve skull contains approximately 1500 grams of the brain (including gray matter and white matter), 100-130 milliliters of blood, and 75 milliliters of cerebrospinal fluid. About 15% of the blood volume is present in the arteries, 40% in the veins, and 45% in the nerve tissue and capillaries. There is a difference between the cerebral blood volume of gray and white matter. The cerebral blood volume value of gray matter is about 3.5 +/- 0.4 ml/100g, and the white matter is about 1.7 +/- 0.4 ml/100g. The gray matter is nearly twice that of white matter. In both white and gray matter, cerebral blood volume decreases by about 0.50% per year with increasing age. Intracranial hematoma and Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) will cause an increase in cerebral blood volume. The ischemic stroke will cause a substantial reduction in cerebral blood volume.  Measurement methods  Schematic representation of a Magnetic Resonance = Magnetic resonance imaging = The cerebral blood volume maps can be calculated by dynamic magnetic resonance image set obtained by echo planar imaging after intravenous injection of thiol contrast agent. Planar imaging techniques or single high-speed shots provide the necessary resolution for contrast agents to display rapid brain blood movements. These magnetic resonance cerebral blood volume imaging methods can be applied to academic research of normal human brain activities and clinical studies of patients with brain tumors. Ct scan cone beam = Emission computed tomography = In vivo studies using emission computed tomography gave coefficients of variation for regional cerebral blood volume and cross-sectional cerebral blood volume over 80 minutes. A clear tomographic depiction of cerebral blood volume distribution in human subjects can achieve by using emission computed tomography, which provides real-time measurements of the cerebral hemodynamic parameters. Carbon monoxide administered by a single inhalation is a reliable and accurate blood tracer for measuring cerebral blood volume with emission computed tomography. = Synchrotron radiation computed tomography = Synchrotron Radiation Computed Tomography uses a monochromatic and parallel X-ray beam to measure the value of cerebral blood volume. It allows the sample to be placed away from the detector, thereby avoiding scattering effects. This technique measures absolute contrast concentration with relatively high precision and spatial resolution. Cerebral blood volume measurements are based on methods used in dynamic computed tomography. After a large dose of iodinated contrast agent was injected into the brain tissue, the temporal change in iodine concentration was compared to changes in cerebral arterial input. It is a new method for studying hemodynamic changes in brain pathophysiology, including clinical studies of cerebrovascular diseases or brain tumors.  Cerebral blood flow  Cerebral blood volume has a close and positive correlation with cerebral blood flow. Both cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow depend on several important parameters, including cerebrovascular resistance, intracranial pressure, and mean arterial pressure. The ratio between cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume can be an accurate predictor of decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, thereby predicting cerebral circulation.

Soro Mik'aya Patjxa was a seasonal residential site that was reused consistently by hunter-gatherers over a period of over a thousand years. Description Situated on a fluvial terrace, the site was first identified by Mark Aldenderfer in 1995. The excavated portion of Soro Mik'aya Patjxa consists of one cultural layer of interest. 13 pits were excavated at the site. The site was occupied at least 1,500 years before the advent of low- level agriculture in the region at around 5,000 BP. Artefacts Over 80,000 artefacts were recovered at the site. The artefact assemblage at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa consists primarily of flaked lithics, and also includes bones, ground stones, charred plant remains, pigment stones (red ocher) and ceramic sherds. As the ceramic sherds were found to stylistically post-date 1,000 AD, the sherds are considered to be intrusive. Human remains The remains of 16 individuals were recovered from pit burials at the site. Five of the crania from the site exhibit signs of intentional cranial modification. Isotopic analysis, estimates of travel distance to nearby lower elevation areas, demographic profiling, and the evidence for the high use of local lithic materials suggest that the individuals at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa were permanent inhabitants of a high-altitude environment. Diet The people at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa likely relied heavily on hunting large, terrestrial mammals and intensive processing and consumption of plants. Projectile points dominate the flaked lithic assemblage at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa. Additionally, the faunal assemblage is dominated by large mammals, most likely coming from Hippocamelus antisensis and the vicu√±a. The remains of guinea pig, Lagidium viscacia and carache fish were also identified from the small faunal remains at the site. The majority of the faunal bones recovered from the site shows evidence of burning. The presence of large quantities of ground stones at the site and dental wear analysis indicate that the consumption of plants was an important part of the diet at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa. Only one of the 251 teeth recovered from the site shows evidence for dental caries, a low rate which is typical of hunter-gatherers. Dental wear analysis suggests a diet typical of terrestrial hunter-gatherers. Dental wear analysis also reveals evidence for lingual surface attrition of the maxillary anterior teeth (LSAMAT), a condition which has been linked with the intensive consumption of tubers by hunter-gatherers. Archaeogenetics In 2018, researchers successfully sequenced the genome from SMP5, a 50-55 male directly dated to around 6800 BP. SMP5 shares a genetic component with later ancient DNA samples from the Lake Titicaca region, a component that is also found in modern Andean populations. When compared against modern populations, SMP5 shows closest genetic affinity for the Quechua people and the Aymara people. Unlike later ancient individuals sequenced from the Lake Titicaca region, SMP5, along with USR1 from the Upward Sun River site, Anzick-1, Kennewick man, and the individual tested from the Saqqaq culture, shows a genetic affinity for modern Siberian populations, especially the Yakuts.

His mother was Melia, a daughter of the Titan Oceanus.Hornblower, p. 433, 1211n; Larson, pp. 40-41, 142; Grimal, s.v. Tenerus, p. 439; Pindar fr. 52k 34‚Äì46 Race, pp. 292-295 = A1 (Pa. IX) Rutherford, pp. 189-192; Strabo, 9.2.34; Pausanias, 9.10.6, 9.26.1. According to Pausanius, Melia, who had been abducted by Apollo, gave birth to Tenerus and his brother Ismenus, the eponym of the Theban river.Pausanias, 9.10.6. However, in some traditions perhaps, the Thebans Melia and Ismenus were siblings, rather than mother and son, see Larson, p. 304 n. 57; Schachter 1967, p. 4; Fontenrose, p. 319; Scholia on Pindar Pythian 11.5‚Äì6 (Drachmann, pp. 254-255); Oxyrhynchus Papyri X 1241.4.5-10 (Grenfell and Hunt, pp. 104: Greek text, 109: translation). The Teneric plain, Northwest of Thebes was named after Tenerus.Hornblower, p. 433, 1211n; Larson, p. 142; Strabo, 9.2.34, citing Pindar, see Pindar fr. 51d Race, pp. 246, 247; Pausanias, 9.26.1. Tenerus was a priest and prophet of Apollo, and had an oracle at the Ismenion, the Temple of Apollo at Thebes.Hornblower, p. 433, 1211n; Scholiast on Pindar Pythian 11.5‚Äì6 (Drachmann, pp. 254-255; Rutherford, p. 196 n. 22); for the Ismenion and the cult of Tenerus, see Schachter 1981, pp. 77-88 (Tenerus: pp. 78-79); Schachter 1967, pp. 3-5. The late 6th‚Äìearly 5th century BC Theban poet Pindar, called Tenerus \\"the temple tending seer\\",Pindar fr. 51d Race, pp. 246, 247 = Strabo, 9.2.34. and referred to him as \\"mighty Tenerus, chosen prophet of oracles\\", to whom Apollo entrusted the city of Thebes, \\"because of his wise courage\\", and whom Poseidon honored \\"above all mortals\\".Pindar fr. 52k 41-42 Race, p. 292, 293 = A1 (Pa. IX) Rutherford, pp. 189-192. A very fragmentary Pindaric Paean, was perhaps addressed to Tenerus. Its first line has the singer sing: \\"(I come to?) the giver of divine oracles\\" and in line thirteen \\"we speak of the hero Tenerus\\", with mentions in the immediately succeeding lines of \\"bulls\\", \\"before the altar\\", \\"they sang a song\\", and \\"oracle\\".Pindar fr. 52g Race, pp. 278, 279 = D7 (Pa. 7) Rutherford, pp. 338-339\\\\. Concerning the first line, Rutherford, p. 340 says \\"I take it that the reference is to a person not a place, and I suggest that Tenerus is the most appropriate referent.\\" Lycophron, refers to Thebes, or perhaps more generally Boeotia, as the \\"land and temples of Teneros\\".Lycophron, Alexandra 1211 (Hornblower, p. 433 with note; cf. Mair, pp. 594, 595). Pausanias says that Tenerus was given \\"the art of divination\\", by his father Apollo.Pausanias, 9.10.6 (Jones and Ormerod). Tenerus was also perhaps connected with the Ptoion, the oracular sanctuary of Apollo Ptoieus at the foot of Mount Ptoion.Although Strabo, 9.2.34, in a passage that quotes from otherwise unknown fragments of Pindar, says that Tenerus was \\"a prophet of the oracle on the Pto√ºs Mountain\\", Schachter 1981, p. 59, says that Tenerus' \\"presence at the Ptoion may be due solely to Pindar\\", while Schachter 1967, p. 4, further explains that Pindar's associating Tenerus with the Ptoion \\"may be a poetic way of asserting the fact of Theban control over the Ptoion, by making the legendary prophet of the Ismenion the prophet of the other oracle.\\" See also Hornblower, p. 433, 1211n: \\"It has been thought, partly from location of the eponymous plain, that Teneros must have been somehow connected with the Ptoiuon. Strabo evidently thought so, 9. 2. 34, and cf. Schacter 1981-94: 1. 59, 3. 40, and many other scholars); but I. Rutherford 2001: 343-4 has challenged this, and is right to insist that hard linking evidence is in short supply. Actually the plain is much closer to Thebes than to the Ptoion (Barr. map 55 E4).\\" NotesReferences * Drachmann, Anders Bj√∏rn, Scholia vetera in Pindari carmina, Vol. II, Lipsiae, 1910.

It also features the presence of numerous German and Ruthenian loanwords which were introduced into the dialect while Bukovina was a province of the Austrian Empire (1774‚Äì1918). Due to the language policy promoted by the Austrian monarchy, several languages were spoken in Bucovina: Ukrainian, Romanian, Polish, German (Buchenl√§ndisch), and Yiddish. Today, the Bucovina dialect is being replaced by the standard Romanian language, especially in the urban areas of southern Bucovina, while the language in northern Bukovina is being replaced by Ukrainian. Subdivisions The Bukovina dialect of the Romanian language can be divided into 5 more subdialects, with a different specificity and a more or less controversial individuality:http://www.alil.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Structura- dialectalƒÉ-a-graiurilor-rom√¢ne»ôti.pdf =Dornean dialect= The Dornean was formed as a bar of transition in the 17th and 18th centuries and is spoken in the area of the former judicial district of Vatra Dornei. The most obvious phonetic differences in relation to the Transylvanian language are achieved not by the distinctive features of sounds, but by the speed of speech and by the prosodic elements. In contrast to the slower speaking and high general tone of the Transylvanian (northeast) Transylvanian, the Bucovina pronunciation is characterized by a faster pace and higher variations in height and intensity; the dynamic emphasis emphasizes the tonic syllables more strongly, but compensates for the short aphonised speech and even the fall of the non-accentuated syllables. =C√¢mpulungean dialect= The dialect is the most archaic and at the same time the most striking individuality. With its center in C√¢mpulung, it extends along the River Moldova, from Fundu Moldovei to Gura Humorului, with branches on the valley of Moldovi»õa: Frumosu and Vatra Moldovi»õei, and from here on Obcina Mare to Sucevi»õa, and on the Suhei Valley in Bucovina: Stulpicani and Ostra villages. =RƒÉdƒÉu»õean dialect= The RƒÉdƒÉu»õean dialect assimilated various Transylvanian influences by due to the significant number of Transylvanian speakers emigrating to there in the eighteenth century. It was influenced by phonetic pronunciations specific to Maramure»ô, northeastern Transylvania, Cri»ôana, northern Banat and southwest Transylvania. The dialect area includes, besides the area between FalcƒÉu (in the West), Siret (in the East) and Solca (in the South) and the localities inhabited by Romanians in the Storojine»õ area (in the North). =Southeast Bucovinean= The area of southeast Bucovina, sometimes referred to as \\"africatizantƒÉ\\" after the specific phonetic phenomenon, was formed in the 18th century by the overlapping of the Transylvanian influences over an archaic dialect. The dialect area covers Gura Humorului (to the West) and Chili»ôeni (to the East), IaslovƒÉ»õ (to the North), the southern limit being the border of the historical Bucovina (Valea Moldovei, StƒÉne»ôti, BƒÉi»ôesti, BrƒÉie»ôti, DrƒÉgoie»ôti, MƒÉzƒÉne»ôti, LucƒÉce»ôti, Vorniceni, Liteni, Bune»ôti, Securiceni, PlƒÉvƒÉlari, Ude»ôti, Poieni-Suceava, and Chili»ôeni). In the east of this dialect area there are linguistic islands where the archaic language was preserved until the settlement of the Transylvanians, showing the remnants of the C√¢mpulungean dialect that was predominant until the settlement of the Transylvanians in the 17th‚Äì18th centuries. =Eastern Bucovina= The dialect is spread over Eastern Bucovina, which includes localities on the eastern border of historical Bucovina. The dialect preserved linguistic peculiarities are when it was separated by the settlement of Transylvanians in the 17th‚Äì18th centuries. From this area belong the localities around Suceava: Bosanci (and the villages later detached from Moara Nica, Moara Carp, Frumoasa, VlƒÉdichii Mill, Bulai, and Podeni), Ti»ôƒÉu»õi, Lisaura, Mihoveni, Cost√¢na, continuing with the former border towns Mitocu Dragomirnei, PƒÉlƒÉra»õi, Calafinde»ôti (where the elements from RƒÉdƒÉu»õean), Sinau»õi de Sus, StƒÉne»ôti, Poieni-Bucovina, »öureni, came to CernƒÉu»õi: the villages of Plaiul Cosminului, Voloca on Derelui, Ostri»õa, Mahala, Boian and LehƒÉcenii »öƒÉutului. This subdialect of the Bucovinean is also spoken by the descendants of the Romanian immigrants to Boian, Alberta, Canada, at the end of the 19th century.

The color of the shell is white, rather opaque, with a broad chestnut-brown band at the periphery, and a faint brownish band below the suture. The shape of the shell is depressed above and below. The spire is low-conoid. The surface is shining, sculptured above with close rib-striae, becoming more delicate below. The shell has 5¬Ω whorls. The earliest whorl is smooth, shining, forming a subacute apex. Following whorls are slightly convex, slowly increasing, separated by an impressed suture. The last whorl is much wider, rounded at the periphery, hardly descending in front. Aperture is slightly oblique, lunate-oval. Peristome is white and thickened with a strong white lip. The umbilicus is rapidly narrowing to a narrow, deep perforation. The width of umbilicus is one-eighth the greatest diameter. The width of the shell is 15 mm. The height of the shell is 8.5 mm.

In 1918, she was one of the first five women to be elected to the Landsting. The others were Nina Bang, Marie Christensen, Marie Hjelmer and Inger Gautier Schmidt. Biography Born on 29 June 1865 in F√∏lle, Syddjurs Municipality, in the east of Jutland, Olga Knudsen was the daughter of Jens Elsbert Knudsen (1826‚Äì1901), who managed a grocery business, and Julie Vilhelmine R√∏nberg (1828‚Äì1888). Unlike her two brothers who went to university, she helped in the home, particularly after her mother's death in 1888. Her brother Ivar gained fame for his development of the diesel engine while Morten was a physician in the army. It was through Morten's wife Thora that Olga Knudsen became interested in the women's movement. She later moved to Vejle with her father but it was not until after his death that she studied drawing at the technical school. From 1902 to 1930, she taught geography and drawing at a girls school in Vejle. Her real interest was nevertheless in women's rights. In 1905, she founded Vejle Women's Association (Vejle Kvindeforening), one of the first association for women in the provinces. In 1907, she collaborated with Elna Munch who founded the Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret (National Association for Women's Suffrage , becoming one of its leading members. In 1909, when women were able to participate in municipal elections, she succeeded in being elected in Vejle, becoming a member of the town council where she remained until 1921. Unusually for a woman, she also headed Vejle's Venstre Association from 1918 to 1929. In 1918, she was one of the first five women to be elected to the Landsting and was the first of them to speak in house. She remained as a representative of Venstre until 1928 when she was replaced by a male candidate. Her main interests in the Landsting were social policy, health and municipal matters. She spent her retirement in Vejle where she took on a number of responsibilities, including the management of a children's home. Olga Knudsen died in Vejle on 26 September 1947.

Though President Omar Bongo and his wife, Josephine Bongo, encouraged filmmaking in the 1970s, there was a 20-year hiatus until filmmaking started to grow again in the new millennium. History French companies made documentaries in colonial Gabon from 1936 onwards. After independence, Philippe Mory, Gabon's first professionally trained actor, organized the Compagnie Cinematographique du Gabon in 1962, and helped produce The Cage, a feature film entered into the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. The national television company supported films like Pierre-Marie Dong's Carrefour humain (1969) and Mory's Les tams-tams se sont tus (1972). Though Gabon had only eight cinemas, President Omar Bongo and his wife Jos√©phine Bongo took a direct personal interest in film. The President built a 400-seat cinema in his presidential palace, and in 1975 founded the Centre National Du Cin√©ma with Mory as director. He also founded a production company, Les Films Gabonais. Gabon saw nine films from six directors in the 1970s. Les Films Gabonais produced several films co-directed by Dong and based on the writings of the presidential couple: Obali (1976) and Ayouma (1977) were based on plays examining social themes by Jos√©phine Bongo, and Demain, un jour nouveau (1978) was a version of the president's memoirs. Another Gabonese film from this period was Charles Mensah's Ilombe (1978). Contemporary cinema After two decades of relative inactivity, Gabonese filmmaking started to rise again in the new millennium. Charles Mensah at the Centre National du Cin√©ma Gabonais (CENACI) had introduced new policies to restructure Gabonese cinema in the early 1990s.Imunga Ivanga, The revival of Gabonese cinema, Revue Africultures, Vol. 36, 2001. Imunga Ivanga started making short films in the 1990s, and his feature film D√¥l√® (2000) was the first Gabonese feature film for two decades. It won festival awards at Carthage, Cannes and Milan. Henri- Joseph Koumba Bididi made a number of short films, and the 2001 feature film The Elephant's Balls. Ivunga and Mory collaborated on L'Ombre de Liberty (2006), and in 2014 Ivunga was made general director of the national television network, Gabon Television.

History  The project for the National Library System is born with the goal of overcoming the fragmentation of, and fostering the co-operation among, Italian library structures, on the impulse of the National Conference of Italian Libraries held in Rome from 22 to 24 January 1979. It was designed by Angela Vinay (Director of ICCU) and Michel Boisset (Director of the European University Institute Library), in collaboration with a group of librarians and computer scientists. The planning phase was officially started on 4 April 1980, with the establishment of an experts' commission made up of representatives from the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (MCHA), the ICCU, the National Central Library of Florence, the European University Institute and the National Research Council. The final document produced by the Commission proposed the creation of the service, articulated in: * a union catalogue of library resources, produced by the integrated set of local catalogues; * a national bibliographic database, ensuring quality, completeness and consistency of bibliographic description; * a national service for document access. In 1982 the project was presented by Angela Vinay to the library community on the occasion of the 30th Congress of the Italian Libraries Association held in Giardini-Naxos on 21‚Äì24 November 1982. In 1984, MCHA subscribed a protocol of understanding with Regions for the development of the SBN project. In 1985, the first two Poles were established, those of the National Central Libraries of Rome and Florence. From 1987 to 1990, the project \\"Library Heritage System\\" () made it possible to recover the catalogues of the National Italian Bibliography (Bibliografia nazionale italiana, BNI), the Bulletin of Foreign Modern Works (Bollettino delle opere moderne straniere, BOMS) and other catalogues related to music and Southern Italy-theme funds, which came to constitute the first substantial nucleus of the catalogue. In 1992, the protocol of understanding MCHA-Regions was extended to the Ministry of University and Scientific and Technological Research involving many university libraries in the project. In addition, through the connection of more Poles to the SBN network, the national network was officially activated. In 1996 a feasibility study was started to create a single database, integrating the previous ones related to modern books, ancient books and music, and enable the management of graphic and cartographic material, also allowing a certain degree of interoperability with programs not developed within SBN. In 2002, with the startup of the project \\"Evolution of the SBN Index\\" (Evoluzione dell'Indice SBN), a restructuring and a rationalization of the Index central database, as well as its opening to other library management systems not related to SBN, using the more widespread bibliographic formats (UNIMARC, MARC21).  Organisation  The National Library Service connects state, local authorities, university and private libraries operating in different disciplinary sectors. Participating libraries are grouped in local hubs, connected in turn to the SBN Index, which contains the collective catalogue of the heritage possessed by the libraries adhering to the service. Adherence to the service implies for the library or local library hub to subscribe an agreement with ICCU, to define their respective commitments to the development of SBN and related services. One of the fundamental functions of the National Library Service is the participatory cataloguing among adhering libraries: every bibliographic record (books, authority codes or other things) is described only once by the library or library hub which acquires it first. The other libraries merely report the record already registered within the Index in their own catalogue, only adding the indication that they also possess that given record. However, the single hub databases only share the bibliographic description of the record, thus keeping total autonomy regarding the possibility of adding further information (such as the local position of a book, purchasing orders, more specific search keys, etc.). Libraries also have full autonomy as to organizational choices and hardware and software investments. As of 5 November 2018 6,320 libraries (organised in 104 hubs) adhere to it, and the bibliographic database contains 17,162,840 bibliographic records, complete with 92,110,636 locations (that is, indications about the library possessing them). The collective catalogue includes documents of different types: ancient material (printed monographies from the 15th century to 1830), modern material (monographies, audio and video recordings, electronic databases, periodicals and other materials since 1831), handwritten music, printed music and libretti, graphic and cartographic material. Accesses to the catalogue pages range between 2.8 millions and 4.6 millions per month.  Services = Bibliographic search = Since 1997, the collective catalogue is available on line by means of the OPAC system, which over time saw the creation of various interfaces.Currently, the catalogue can be consulted through the websites http://opac.sbn.it/ and http://www.internetculturale.it/. There is also an access mode via Z39.50. Completing the search a set of services are available, such as for example the save of the searches made during the session, the management of favourites lists and the sending of results via e-mail. Through the OPAC consultation is also possible: * accessing the consultation, loan and reproduction services offered by libraries on their local OPAC's; * accessing information related to the opening hours and the heritage possessed by the libraries taking part in SBN, thanks to the integration with the Italian Libraries Database; * consulting the authority items of uniform authors and titles; * accessing possible digital resources; * viewing or downloading bibliographic records in the UNIMARC format; * consulting also other national and international catalogues as client Z39.50. = Interlibrary loan = The National Library Service puts at disposal the Inter library loan SBN (ILL SBN), a national service of interlibrary loan and document delivery, accessible to everybody and addressed to librarians and end users. The interlibrary loan service was at the base of the SBN project, having integrated competences and projects which had been started in November 1979 by the working group \\"Co-operation Experience\\" (Esperienza di cooperazione, ECO), later continued in the project \\"National Document Access Service\\" (Servizio nazionale di accesso ai documenti, SNADOC), started in Tuscany in the mid-1980s.. In the 2010s, the loan service can be accessed through the catalogue of the National Library Service, via the ACNP national serial catalogue (Catalogo italiano dei periodici, \\"Italian Union Catalogue of Serials\\") and the ESSPER serial catalogue (Catalogo collettivo di spogli di periodici italiani di economia, scienze sociali e storia dell'Associazione ESSPER, \\"Collective Catalogue of Selected Italian Periodicals of Economics, Social Sciences and History of the ESSPER Association\\").

Her columns appeared on the Op-Ed page at a time when few women received bylines outside the Women‚Äôs Pages. She was noted for taking other writers to task for lapses in grammar and for frequently including mention of her cat, Edith, in her columns. Early life and education Young was born in Dayton, Ohio on October 4, 1912, to artist Harry W. and Isabel Gilbert McPherson. She graduated from Dayton's Steele High School in 1930 and received a Bachelor's degree (1934) and a Master's (1936) from Oberlin College. Early career After receiving her degree in English literature from Oberlin College in 1934, Young applied for a job at the Dayton Journal, who told her \\"We don't hire women! But if you want to work for free, we'll let you.\\" At her mother's insistence she returned to school to get a degree she could use to make a living. Young taught English, German, Latin and journalism for more than thirty years at Wilbur Wright and then High School, both in Dayton. \\"It took me until 1970 to work my way out of the classroom.\\" She replaced \\"legendary\\" columnist Marj Heyduck, who died that year.

Novelist P. D. James described their friendship in a column memorializing Young. The University of Dayton holds her library. Books In addition to her weekly column, Young wrote academic textbooks, young adult biography and fiction, history, and popular literature. Her books were variously published under the names Rosamond McPherson, Rosamond McPherson Young, and Roz Young. Personal life Young married former widower William A.

Route It runs from Ziegelbr√ºcke railway station as an extension of the Lake Z√ºrich left-bank railway. It is an important rail link in the south and east of the canton of St. Gallen and follows the left bank of the Walensee and the Seeztal. It is double-track, except for a short, one- track section between M√ºhlehorn and Murg. It connects with the Rhine valley line in Sargans. Since the 1980s, there has been a loop in Sargans which allows EuroCity services and freight trains operating directly between Z√ºrich and Austria to avoid reversing in the station.  History The Ziegelbr√ºcke‚ÄìSargans railway and its continuation to Chur was built as part of sections of different lines of the United Swiss Railways (Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen, VSB), which were opened independently of each other. First, the line between Chur and Sargans was opened as part of the Chur‚ÄìRheineck line on 1 July 1858. Operations commenced on the Sargans‚ÄìMurg line and between Ziegelbr√ºcke and Weesen as part of the R√ºti‚ÄìWeesen‚ÄìGlarus line on 15. February 1859. The Murg‚ÄìWeesen line was opened on 1 July 1859. Until 1875 all express trains to and from Chur ran via the Uster‚ÄìRapperswil line, as the Thalwil‚ÄìPf√§ffikon line of the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn, NOB) had not yet been completed. As early as 1918, passenger traffic on the Weesen‚ÄìN√§fels section of the former VSB R√ºti‚ÄìWeesen‚ÄìGlarus line was abandoned, because the connection from Glarus to the former NOB line appeared more useful. The disused section was dismantled in 1931. In the following years, the track was straightened and duplicated. First, in 1941, the Bommerstein Tunnel was relocated east of Mols. In 1961, the double-track Kerenzerberg Tunnel was opened, replacing the one-track section along the Walensee west of Murg. The old route was used for the construction of the Walenseestrasse (Walensee road), which required the tunnels to be widened. It now operates as the northern carriageway of the A3 autobahn. In 1969, the line between the west portal of the Kerenzerberg Tunnel and Ziegelbr√ºcke was straightened. This involved the relocation of Weesen station from the north side of the Linth canal to the south side and the construction of a new Linth canal bridge and the Biberlikopf Tunnel. Today only very short section between M√ºhlehorn and Murg is single track. Today (2018), an InterCity and an InterRegio service runs every hour between Z√ºrich and Chur. While the InterCity trains predominantly consist of IC2000 push-pull sets propelled by class SBB Re 460 locomotives, there are also locomotive-hauled trains consisting of standard coaches (Einheitswagen) and (partly former) Eurocity coaches hauled by locomotives of classes Re 420 or Re 460\\\\. The InterRegios were converted to Stadler KISS (RABe 511) at the end of 2013 and they no longer continue through Zurich to/from Basel, but they also stop in Walenstadt. This also eliminated the InterRegio services that had continued twice a day from Basel to Hamburg-Altona. These two train operated as EuroCity services, but had the same stopping pattern as IR services. At the end of 2013, the regional trains were also changed. Instead of NPZ push-pull trains, which ran from Ziegelbr√ºcke to Chur, the line is now served by line S 4 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn using Stadler Flirt sets and stops at all the stations between Ziegelbr√ºcke and Sargans. Weesen station has not been served since this change (instead, the Ziegelbr√ºcke‚ÄìAmden bus route of the Autobetrieb Weesen-Amden serves it every half hour). Occasionally, line S 2 of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn is extended to Unterterzen (without stopping at the intermediate stations), usually on the weekend.

It is situated 27km away from sub-district headquarter Patti and 35km away from district headquarter Tarn Taran. According to Census 2011 information the village code of Khalra village is 038051. The total geographical area of village is 629 hectares. Khalra has a total population of 5,831 peoples. There are about 1,053 houses in Khalra village. Patti is nearest town to Khalra. Gurudwara Shri Pehli patshahi sahib, khalra Gurudwara Shri Patshahi Pehli Sahib Gurudwara Shri Patshahi Pehli Sahib is situated in village khalra. GURU NANAK sahib visited this place. GURU SAHIB came here after teaching the farmers of Patti. GURU SAHIB preached sangat the way of life and did gurbani kirtan and established a Dharmsala here. Location Khalra is from the India-Pakistan border on the west end of National Highway 703B (earlier designated as State Highway 19) in the state of Punjab, India. Personalities Human right activist Jaswant Singh Khalra was dissident of Village khalra. Jaswant Singh was born on 2 November 1952 to Parents Kartar Singh and Mukhteir kaur. Jaswant Singh's father Kartar Singh also served as the Head master of Khalra high school and was one of its founding members. Jaswant Singh Khalra was internationally renowned human right activist who uncovered grave human right violation in state of Punjab by Indian security forces. Following Operation Blue Star, the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the 1984 organized massacre of Sikhs, the police were empowered to detain suspects for any reason, ostensibly as suspected terrorists. The police were accused of killing unarmed suspects in staged shootouts and burning thousands of dead bodies to cover up the murders. Khalra was investigating four major cases at one time and continued to collect evidence and witnesses. These cases included the custodial killing of Behla, human-shield case concerning the death of seven civilians, cremation of 25,000 unidentified bodies in Punjab and that police had killed about 2,000 policemen not collaborating in counter-terror operations. CBI concluded that police had unlawfully cremated 2,097 people in Tarn Taran district alone. As per the CBI investigation records quoted by SC division bench in their judgement on the Khalra custodial death case, he was a human rights activist working on the abduction, elimination, and cremation of unclaimed human bodies during the disturbed period. The court observed that the police had been eliminating young persons under the pretext of being militants and disposing of their bodies without record. While searching for some colleagues who went missing, Jaswant Singh Khalra discovered files from the municipal corporation of the city of Amritsar which contained the names, ages, and addresses of those who had been killed and later burnt by the police. Further research revealed cases in 3 other districts in Punjab, increasing the list by thousands. The National Human Rights Commission released a list of some of the identified bodies that were cremated in the police districts of Amritsar, Majitha and Tarn Taran between June 1984 to December 1994. The Supreme Court of India and the National Human Rights Commission of India has certified the validity of this data. Jaswant Singh Khalra asserted there could have been over 25,000 Sikhs killed and cremated by the state. There are still many Sikh families waiting to hear news of what happened to their missing loved ones, many wondering if they might still be alive. A list of names has been published by Tribune India. On 6 September 1995, while washing his car in front of his house, Khalra was allegedly abducted by personnel of Punjab Police and taken to Jhabal Police Station. Although witnesses gave statements implicating the police and have named former police chief Kanwar Pal Singh Gill as a conspirator, police have denied ever arresting or detaining him and have claimed to have no knowledge of his whereabouts. In 1996, the Central Bureau of Investigation found evidence that he was held at a police station in Tarn Taran and recommended the prosecution of nine Punjab police officials for murder and kidnapping. Those accused of his murder were not charged for ten years, though one of the suspects committed suicide in 1997. On 18 November 2005, six Punjab police officials were convicted and sentenced to seven years imprisonment for Khalra's abduction and murder. On 16 October 2007, a division bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court, chaired by Justices Mehtab Singh Gill and A N Jindal, extended the sentence to life imprisonment for four accused: Satnam Singh, Surinder Pal Singh, Jasbir Singh (all former sub inspectors) and Prithipal Singh (former head constable). On 11 April 2011, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the appeal filed against the sentence to life imprisonment for the four accused, scathingly criticizing the atrocities committed by Punjab Police during the disturbance period.

Based on the BMW 3 Series (E90), the B3 and D3 were available in coup√©, saloon, convertible (not available for the D3) and station wagon body styles. The B3 was officially unveiled at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show.  Development and introduction  Development of the B3 began in 2006. At that time, it was speculated that the car would either be introduced with a 4.4-litre supercharged V8 engine (already used in the B5, B6 and B7) or a naturally aspirated V8 engine (as used in the 550i and 750i). The supercharger would've been Alpina's own design. Both of these speculations were nullified when the car was introduced in 2007 as it utilised a modified version of the BMW N54 inline-6 engine used in the 335i. The B3 was available with rear- wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive drivetrains. The cars equipped with the all- wheel-drive (BMW xDrive) system were called Allrad. The engine was modified by the addition of an Alpina specific ECU, oil cooler and lighter and stronger MAHLE pistons. These modifications allowed the engine to generate between 5,500 rpm to 6,000 rpm and of torque at 3,800 rpm to 5,000 rpm. The engine has a red-line of 7,000 rpm. The engine was mated to a 6-speed ZF automatic transmission paired with a control system called Switch Tronic. The control system was first introduced by the company in 1993 and has a manual mode which allows the driver to change gears either by the gear lever or by buttons present behind the steering wheel. Shift times had been significantly improved, taking 100 milliseconds to shift gears. The company re-introduced one of their signature exterior colours for the B3 namely Alpina Green as Alpina Green II. However, the car could be ordered in any colour out of the standard exterior colours as offered on its predecessor. The exterior changes included optional Alpina pinstripes, a front spoiler with Alpina lettering, the choice of three alloy wheels; 19-inch classic wheels, 20-inch multi-spoke wheels and 19-inch traditional wheels (set of 4-spokes in a 5-spoke design), a rear lip spoiler and a light weight Akrapovic stainless steel exhaust system with quad exhaust tips. The exhaust system had a floating tip design, a first to be used on an Alpina vehicle. The interior included Alpina logos and lettering, Alpina side sills, heated sport seats, wood trim, Lavalina leather upholstery, cruise control, Alpina floor mats and Alpina gauges with the speedometer reading up to on the European models. The interior could be customised to the customer specifications by the Alpina interior department. The suspension system of the B3 utilised a mixture of in-house developed components and BMW components. The coup√© and cabriolet version used the shocks from the 335i Sport while the Saloon and Wagon variants used the shocks as found on the standard 335i. The coil springs as found on the 335i Sport are used throughout the B3 versions. The rear subframe bushings are the same as those found on the 335d while the secondary springs used are a mixture of those found on the 335xd and 335i Sport. The front stabilisers are the same as used on the 335i Sport while the rear stabilisers are bespoke units which are smaller than those found on the 335i. The use of different stabilisers allow for a better turn in and safe cornering. The suspension geometry is shared with the D3. The tyres used on the B3 are Michelin Pilot Sport tyres measuring 245/35 ZR18 at the front and 265/30 ZR18 at the rear. The tyres use the same aspect ratio as on the B7.  Performance  The B3 can accelerate from in 4.8 seconds (5.0 seconds for the convertible, 4.9 seconds for the wagon) and can attain a claimed top speed of ( for the convertible). Tested performance figures are as follows: * : 2.39 seconds * : 3.30 seconds * : 4.15 seconds * : 5.17 seconds * : 6.51 seconds * : 7.96 seconds * : 9.57 seconds * : 11.57 seconds  Variants = D3 = Alpina D3 (E90) The D3 is the diesel powered variant of the B3. It is based on the 320d but utilises a modified version of the N47 inline-4 diesel engine as found on the 123d. The reason to use this engine was to have high performance while maintaining a good fuel economy. The engine received the same modifications as on the B3 with the only difference being the cat back exhaust system having dual exhaust tips instead of quad. The modifications allow the engine to generate and of torque between 2,000 and 2,500 rpm. The D3 is claimed to be more fuel efficient than its 3 Series diesel counterparts (those being the 325d and 335d). The D3 has BMW efficient dynamics system, a start/stop system, a decoupling alternator and active aerodynamics as standard. Unlike the B3, the D3 was not offered in the convertible body style. The use of the inline-4 engine allows the car to be lighter than the donor car, the difference being in terms of weight. It also allows the car to have better handling than its counterparts also made possible due to non-run flat tyres. Performance figures include a acceleration time of 6.9 seconds and a top speed of . = B3 S = The B3 S is a high performance variant of the B3. Introduced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, the B3 S had a redesigned front spoiler, 19-inch wheels from the B7 and a new rear diffuser. The engine received a new ECU to result in a power increase to at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm. The engine had a compression ratio of 9.4:1 and a peak boost pressure of 1.2 bar. The B3 S saw a performance improvement over the B3 and that included a acceleration time of 4.7 seconds (0.1 seconds more for the wagon and 0.2 seconds more for the convertible with the roof closed) and a top speed of ( for the convertible with the roof closed and for the wagon). The B3 S had wider tyres than the B3, those measuring 245/40 ZR18 at the front and 265/40 ZR18 at the rear. The interior options remained the same as on the standard B3. = B3 GT3 = Alpina B3 GT3 The B3 GT3 is a high performance variant of the B3 S. Available only in the coup√© bodystyle, the GT3 commemorates Alpina's return to motorsport. The N54 inline-6 engine as used in the B3 S is modified by the addition of an Akrapovic titanium exhaust system and generates 6,000 rpm and of torque 4,500 rpm. The GT3 has a track-oriented coil over suspension system having 12 settings of damper compression and 18 settings of damper rebound along with a lowered ride height. The GT3 is fitted with 19-inch black forged multi-spoke alloy wheels finished in Himalaya Grey weighing less than . The brakes have rotors measuring front and aft with six-piston callipers. The car has a Drexler mechanical limited slip differential as standard. The exterior changes included a new front spoiler, front canards, a larger rear diffuser and a fixed rear wing. The GT3 had a limited production run of 99 units. Performance figures included a acceleration time of 4.5 seconds and a claimed top speed of .

Early life  Backhouse was born on 21 May 1917 in Northam, Western Australia, the second child and only daughter of William Backhouse, a violinist and railway worker, and his wife Hilda, n√©e Booth, a piano teacher. She learned violin and piano from her parents, and attended the local government school. A sexual assault when she was a girl changed her life: her vision and speech were affected, and her schoolwork and hopes for university suffered.  Career = WAAAF and first novels = At the start of WWII, Backhouse joined the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force and was stationed near Melbourne. There, she wrote her first three novels while off-duty. In Our Hands (1942), set in Perth, concerned \\"a group of interesting young moderns ... brought sharply up against the war\\"; it was considered to be \\"a forerunner of good things to come\\", \\"the characterisation in some cases excellent and the dialogue bright\\". It was so popular that it went into a second edition. Her second book, The Sky Has Its Clouds (1944), was \\"a colourful novel involving the fortunes of an interesting group of people, with a ballerina in the leading role\\", and covered the period from 1920 to the outbreak of war, moving from a small Australian country town to Europe. One reviewer found it \\"very entertaining\\", another judged it \\"a well-constructed, fast-moving tale which holds the reader's interest from first page to last\\", and another considered that with it, \\"Miss Backhouse has established a very definite place for herself in the community of Australian authors.\\" Backhouse's third novel, Day Will Break (1945), took as its setting France and England during the time of the French revolution. Reviews were mixed, with critics' opinions ranging from \\"skilfully written\\", \\"ambitious ... strong enough to overcome [its] handicap[s]\\", to \\"readable\\", \\"too long\\", \\"rather dull\\". However, it \\"enjoy[ed] a great vogue\\", and appeared in a second edition. Backhouse published two books in 1946, one a children's story, Enone and Quentin, and the other a modern novel, Leaves in the Wind, set in Western Australia and featuring three young women and their mothers. Enone and Quentin, \\"a fairy book full of romance and make-believe\\", was warmly received, with one reviewer describing it as \\"sheer delight, with fantasy as free as a child's heart.\\" The same reviewer wrote that \\"it seems Miss Backhouse shudders away from suffering ... and cannot ask her readers to face anything but a happy ending\\", and that Leaves in the Wind, \\"a story of 3 illegitimate girls, is literally too good to be true.\\" = England and screenwriting = In mid 1946, Backhouse travelled to England, where she lived for five years and worked for film producer Alexander Korda, writing scenarios. = Return to Australia; crime novels = She returned to Australia in 1951, and continued writing novels, demonstrating the versatility noted by reviewers by \\"producing a series of strongly-imagined and fluently- written crime novels\\". During the 1950s and 1960s, she published one novella and six novels in this genre. The novella, A Wreath for the Party, appeared as a supplement to the Australian Women's Weekly in August 1954. The novel Death Came Uninvited, published in 1957 by Robert Hale of London, is an expanded version of the same story. It is set in London, with Inspector Christopher Marsden detecting, and was described as a \\"neatly devised work[] of homicide\\". Several of the novels were set in Western Australia  Death of a Clown (1962), for example, featured a circus troupe visiting Carnarvon, The Web of Shadows (1960) and Death Climbs a Hill (1963) were set in the bush, and The Mists Came Down (1959) takes place on Rottnest Island. Most featured two Western Australian police detectives, Detective-Inspector Prentis and Detective Sergeant Landles. The hero of The Mists Came Down, Steve Gillman, however, was an American private detective, \\"a thoughtful, intelligent hero in the English tradition, who solves a murder in a closed community with a measured calm that came to typify later Backhouse efforts.\\" = Script writing = After Death Climbs a Hill, Backhouse published no further crime novels, but instead turned to writing for stage and screen. The Thin Line, a play about euthanasia, was professionally read at the Emerald Hill Theatre, Melbourne, in 1966, and performed at the Playhouse Theatre, Perth, in 1968. Mirage was performed at the Octagon Theatre, Crawley, Western Australia, in 1972, and had a play reading by the Melbourne Theatre Company in 1986. The Olive Tree (1975) was a 70 minute film for TV written and co- produced by Backhouse, which screened in Australia and the US. Set on a Western Australian cattle station, it involved a \\"farmer .. united with his son after 20 years, when he decides to sell his property. The meeting is marked with emotional outbursts from both father and son.\\" Backhouse also wrote the scenario for a ballet, KAL, which was performed by the West Australian Ballet in 1979 for the 150th anniversary of the founding of the state of Western Australia, and a musical, Dickens‚Äô Magic. = Family history = Backhouse's final published works were family history and memoir. Against Time and Place (1990) relates the stories of four generations of her family, particularly the women, in Yorkshire, England and then in Western Australia and other Australian states. It \\"combines fact, legend and re-creations of dialogue\\", and received largely positive reviews. One reviewer commented that Backhouse \\"tells the story with humour and a direct simplicity ... it's a joy to read\\". Another reviewer found it \\"indigestible\\" when attempting to read it as a whole, but good for \\"dipping into .... a poignant composition of beautifully drawn tableaus and vignettes\\". Extracts from Against Time and Place were published in several anthologies during the 1990s. and it has been described as ranking \\"with such successes as Facey's A Fortunate Life and Sally Morgan's My Place.\\"  Personal life  Backhouse had returned to Australia in 1951 because her father was seriously ill. While working during the day, she cared for him until his death in 1952. When her mother Hilda's health began to fail some years later, Backhouse brought her mother to live with her. They lived together for twenty-three years, until Hilda's death in 1984; for the last ten years, Hilda was bedridden. Backhouse worked for an insurance company in Perth. She was a member of the Fellowship of Australian Writers (WA), and served as a committee member and vice-president. A regular church-goer in her childhood, she later became a Freemason and a believer in reincarnation. Backhouse died in North Perth, Western Australia, on 28 April 2013.

The battle was fought near Italica (a Roman colony in Spain) and ended in a stunning victory for the Metellan army.Livy, Epitome, 91.4; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.1.2 and 2.3.5; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.47; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.118-119. Background In 88 BC Lucius Cornelius Sulla marched his legions on Rome starting a civil war. Quintus Sertorius, a client of Gaius Marius, joined his patron's faction and took up the sword against the Sullan faction (mainly optimates). After the death of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gaius Marius, Sertorius lost faith with his factions leadership. In 82 BC, during the second war against Sulla, he left Italy for his assigned propraetorian province in Hispania.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius , 6. Unfortunately his faction lost the war in Italy right after his departure and in 81 BC Sulla sent Gaius Annius Luscus with several legions to take the Spanish provinces from Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 7. After a brief resistance Sertorius and his men are expelled form Hispania. They ended up in Mauretania in north-western Africa where they conquered the city of Tingis. Here the Lusitanians, a fierce Iberian tribe who were about to be invaded by a Sullan governor, approached him. They asked him to become their war leader in the fight against the Sullans. In 80 BC Sertorius landed at the little fishing town of Baelo near the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar) and returned to Hispania. Soon after his landing he fought and defeated the Sullan general Fufidius (the aforementioned Sullan governor) at the Baetis river. After this he defeated several Sullan armies and drove his opponents from Spain. Threatened by Sertorius' success the Senate in Rome upgraded Hispania Ulterior to a proconsular province and sent the proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius with a large army to fight him.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.68. Sertorius used guerrilla tactics so effectively he wore down Metellus to the point of exhaustion while Sertorius' legate Lucius Hirtuleius defeated the governor of Hispania Citerior Marcus Domitius Calvinus. In 76 BC the government in Rome decided to send Pompey and an even larger army to help Metellus.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 17. In the same year Sertorius is joined by Marcus Perpenna, who brought him the remnants of the army of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the rebel consul of 78 BC.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15. Thus reinforced Sertorius decided to try and take the Spanish east coast (because the cities there support his enemies). His first target was the city of Lauron where, against Pompey, Sertorius showed himself to be the better general. Sertorius' forces massacred a large part of Pompey's army (see: the Battle of Lauron).Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.96-101. Prelude In 75 BC Sertorius decided to take on Metellus and leave the battered Pompey to his legates Perpenna and Herennius. Pompey however defeated his opponents in a battle near ValentiaPlutarch, Life of Pompey, 18. and forced Sertorius to come and take charge of the situation, leaving Hirtuleius to deal with Metellus.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 19. Metellus and Hirtuleius were campaigning near the Roman colony of Italica when Hirtuleius made the mistake of trying to force his opponent into a pitched battle. The Battle Hirtuleius mustered his army some time soon after dawn and marched on Metellus's encampment trying to provoke his opponent into battle. Metellus kept his troops in his camp behind their entrenchments until noon. It was extremely hot and Hirtuleius's troops were soon sweltering out in the open while Metellus's legionaries remained relatively fresh.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.1.2. Since his enemy remained drawn up in front of his camp for hours, Metellus had plenty of time to study their dispositions and make his own plans accordingly.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.119. He observed that Hirtuleius had posted his strongest units in the centre of his battle line and decided to use this to his advantage. When the battle finally commenced Metellus held back his own centre and concentrated on winning on the flanks. After routing their opponents his flanks he enveloped Hirtuleius centre.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.3.5. This was the classic tactic used by Hannibal at Cannae almost a century and a half ago. It had worked then and it had worked now. Hirtuleius lost 20,000 men at Italica and, chastened, he fled north to join his commander Sertorius who was squaring off against Pompey. Metellus was right on his heels wanting to make the most of his victory by trapping Sertorius between Pompey and himself. Aftermath With Hirtuleius' army destroyed Metellus and Pompey had the opportunity to catch Sertorius between themselves. Metellus marched his army north to fall on Sertorius' rear, unfortunately Pompey decided to take Sertorius on before Metellus arrived and almost lost his army and life at the Battle of Sucro. When Metellus finally arrived Sertorius retreated toward Clunia in Celtiberia and reverted to guerrilla warfare. The war would drag on for another three years and only end because a few of his own men plotted against Sertorius and assassinated him.

Description The length of the shell attains 25.3 mm, its diameter 8 mm. (Original description) The slender, fusiform shells has a moderate size. The aperture is a little less than half as high as the entire shell. The shell contains approximately 11 whorls in the adult, increasing regularly in size. The protoconch is obtuse and rather elevated, thrice coiled. The initial volution is smooth, polished, largely submerged. The succeeding whorls turn inflated but gradually flattening away from the apex. The final turn of the protoconch is compressed laterally, sculptured with crowded asymmetrically arcuate axial riblets, about 20 to the whorl, extending from the posterior suture to the periphery, which is cut off from the anterior suture by a rather deep linear channel. The beginning of the conch is marked by the initiation of 5 spiral lirae, the posterior of which is the broadest, and the anterior, which outlines the periphery, the most elevated. The sculpture is modified on the later volutions by the increasing prominence of the peripheral spiral and that directly behind it, the intercalation of secondaries, and the development of undulatory axials 8 to 10 to the whorl. These are indicated chiefly in the crenulation of the peripheral spirals. The periphery of antepenult whorls is situated a little more than one third of the distance across from the anterior to the posterior suture, outlined by a simple elevated spiral cord. A second spiral of similar character and almost equal elevation is a short distance behind it, the two separated from one another by a shallow interspace in which a medial secondary and two microscopically fine tertiaries are symmetrically intercalated. Both of the peripheral spirals are broadly and regularly scalloped by the axial undulations. The area between the posterior peripheral primary and the posterior suture is feebly concave, lirated with a strongly elevated primary directly in front of the suture and 3 equal and closely spaced secondaries between the posterior primary and the posterior peripheral spiral. A microscopically fine tertiary in some specimens is introduced directly behind the periphery. A strong secondary and two or more tertiaries are usually developed between the anterior peripheral spiral and the spiral upon which the suture revolves. The body whorl in front of the periphery is lirated to the anterior siphonal fasciole with about 12 elevated cords, regular in size and spacing, becoming increasingly less prominent and less distant anteriorly, with 2 to 4 threadlets intercalated between each pair, the medial thread usually the least feeble. The anterior fasciole is also obscurely threaded. The suture line is very inconspicuous. The aperture is mutilated in all available specimens, narrowly pyriform, expanding slightly posteriorly. The outer lip is widely flaring incrementally, narrowly but deeply sinuated in front of the anterior primary, distantly lirated within. The lirae are not persistent to the margin. The parietal wall is thinly glazed, not entirely concealing the lirae upon the base of the body and the columella, which continue far within the aperture. The anterior canal is short, recurved, with parallel proximate margins.Gardner J.A. (1937). The molluscan fauna of the Alum Bluff Group of Florida. Part VI.

In 1935 he became a curator there but was dismissed the same year for racial reasons. After a visit to Harvard University in 1936, Jakob Rosenberg emigrated to the United States in 1937, where he was admitted to Harvard through Adolph Goldschmidt and his friend Paul Sachs. He was first a research fellow and lecturer, then in 1940 associate professor and in 1947 full professor. His 1948 overview work on Rembrandt was reprinted in 1964 and 1968, holding its own as a standard work during the early years of the Rembrandt Research Project. He was also director of the Graphic Collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 1939. In 1954 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

His experimental music bands, playing intuitive music, are Kec-Mec, Apropos Filmphoto Cartoonband (Aprop√≥ Film Fot√≥ Rajzfilmzenekar) and Hymnus. His first solo photography exhibition, Sp√°rgat√°rlat, was held at Bercs√©nyi Club in Budapest in 1974. His photographs are considered to be exceptional because of their progressivity and sensitivity. \\"...his photographic work that radically challenged the conventions of portraits, self-portraits, and nudes...\\" Vet≈ë collaborated with the body artist Tibor Hajas. Between 1976 and 1980, as Hajas's photographer, co-worker and friend, Vet≈ë participated in the preparation and implementation of Hajas's performances as well as in the creation of works (photo series) based on the performances which were published under both of their names.

They created drawings, paintings, sculpture and textile works using the name Zuzu-Vet≈ë. They applied markers, coloured pencils, brushes and spray and decorated their paintings (Two Hearts are a Couple, 1983) and textile works (Work Flag and Love Flag) with beads, feathers and various everyday objects. Stones, bones and transistors were applied on their sculptures (≈∞rk≈ëkorszaki szoborportr√©k/Cellar Statue portraits from the Space-Stone Age), and they named their extremely colourful installations made by using blue vitriol and powder paint as \\"gardens\\" (≈∞rk≈ëkorszaki pinceszoborkert/Basement Sculpture Garden from the Stone-Space Age, 1982, Szentendre, Vajda Lajos Studio). Each of their solo exhibitions is an installation that consists of their works and impromptu sculptures, their personal belongings as well as found objects (Tibeti ≈êszi T√°bor/Tibet Autumn Camp, 1981, Budapest, Young Artists Club; √öj z√°szl√≥k, √∫j szelek/New Flags, New Winds 1983, Budapest, Young Artists Club).

As a two-year-old in 2018 she was undefeated in three races including the Miss Grillo Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf. After being winless in three starts at age three, she won her four-year- old debut, the Intercontinental Stakes. Background Newspaperofrecord is a bay filly with a white blaze and white socks on her hind legs bred in Ireland by Times of Wigan. As a yearling she was offered for sale at Tattersalls in October 2017 and was bought by Klaravich Stables for 200,000 guineas. The filly was exported to the United States and was sent into training with Chad Brown. She is from the fifth crop of foals sired by the Prix du Jockey Club winner Lope de Vega: other foals from Lope de Vega's first crop included the winners of the Gran Criterium, Sirenia Stakes and Cornwallis Stakes. His other foals have included Belardo, Vega Magic (Memsie Stakes) The Right Man (Al Quoz Sprint) and Santa Ana Lane (Stradbroke Handicap). Newspaperofrecord's dam Sunday Times was a successful racemare who won the Sceptre Stakes and finished second in the Cheveley Park Stakes. She was descended from the Argentinian mare Zamba (foaled 1949), making her a distant relative of La Lorgnette and Hawk Wing. Racing career=2018: two-year-old season= Newspaperofrecord at the 2018 Breeders' Cup As a two-year-old Newspaperofrecord was campaigned exclusively on turf and was ridden in all three of her races by Irad Ortiz Jr. The filly made her debut in a maiden special weight over eight and a half furlongs at Saratoga Race Course on August 19. Starting the 3-2 favourite in a ten-runner field she raced in second place before taking the lead in the last quarter mile and \\"scampered\\" away from her rivals to win by almost seven lengths. On September 30 over the same distance the filly was stepped up in class for the Grade II Miss Grillo Stakes at Belmont Park and started favourite against eight opponents. She took the lead from the start, accelerated away from field in the closing stages and came home six and a half lengths clear of Varenka. Ortiz commented \\"Our plan was try to relax her and finish, but she broke so sharp, and I didn't take anything away. She put me right there and made the lead so easy. She was relaxed on the lead, so I took it, and it was good for us. She was relaxed the whole way\\". At Churchill Downs on November 2, Newspaperofrecord was one of fourteen fillies to contest the 11th running of the Grade I Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf. She was made the 4-5 favourite ahead of the Irish filly Just Wonderful (winner of the Rockfel Stakes) while the other runners included East (Prix Thomas Bryon), Concrete Rose (Jessamine Stakes), La Pelosa (Natalma Stakes) and Lily's Candle (Prix Marcel Boussac). After taking the lead from the start, Newspaperofrecord kicked away from her rivals in the straight and won by six and three quarter lengths from East. After the race Chad Brown said \\"She showed her class today, her brilliance. She's a hard horse to beat because she has that good positional front-running speed and then she kicks for home like a closer. What a freaky horse!\\". =2019: three-year-old season= Newspaperofrecord made her three-year-old debut on May 5 at Churchill Downs in the Edgewood Stakes. Run at one mile and one sixteenth on turf labelled as \\"firm\\", Newspaperofrecord started from the inside post and was made the odds on favorite. She broke on top and held a commanding lead into the far turn, leading by as much as six lengths entering the home stretch. However, she slowed down in the final furlong and was easily run down by Concrete Rose, who had won three of her previous four races, but who had finished 8th in the Breeders Cup Juvenile Turf. Newspaperofrecord made her next start in the Wonder Again Stakes at Belmont, where she again went to the early lead only to be passed in late stretch to finish second. Brown felt that because of her front-running style, she might be \\"getting a little lost when she's so alone\\" turning into the stretch. In her next start on July 6 in the Belmont Oaks Invitational, he asked Ortiz to try to get her to rate behind the front runners. However, Newspaperofrecord became rank and ran wide into the first turn, then veered even wider down the backstretch, interfering with several of the other horses. She finished last behind Concrete Rose. =2020: four-year-old season= Newspaperofrecord was given a long layoff then returned on June 6, 2020 in the Intercontinental Stakes, run at a distance of seven furlongs over a yielding turf course at Belmont.

The War Office was governed directly by the Private Secretary of the King; it was based in the Royal Palace of Madrid. One of the King's most imperative achievements was to create a compromise between both sides of the conflict, to prevent the further sinking of hospital ships. As consequence of this, Spanish naval observers sailed hospital ships of various countries, in order to ensure that the vessels were being used for their intended purpose, as opposed to military expeditions. The King also collaborated in the creation of a dedicated signal code for hospital ships. Spanish neutrality In the interim of World War I, Spain remained neutral due to several inducements. One of these, more esteemed, reasons for the King, was because of his family bonds‚Äîhis wife being British and his mother Austrian, among other family relations. Nonetheless, this did not prevent the King from forming the European War Office, thus, expressing involvement in the war. On August 7, 1914, it was published in Gazeta de Madrid, a Royal Decree, signed by both King Alfonso and Prime Minister Eduardo Dato, declared the country's neutrality, stating that government had the \\"duty to order the strictest neutrality to Spanish subjects in accordance with the laws in force and the principles of public international law\\". For the Government, there was no purpose to engage in the conflict, especially considering that there were not enough resources to do so‚Äî a reason which the political and economic class conceded upon. King Alfonso also agreed, despite having talked with the French ambassador of his desire to enter the conflict on the side of the Allies in exchange of \\"some tangible satisfaction,\\" presumably referring to Tangier. Another consequential rationale for Spanish neutrality was the precariousness of its armed forces. Spain was involved in numerous conflicts in the north of Africa because of its protectorate of Morocco. This situation caused for an outdated Army, with inferior supplies and, because of the large number of officers, most of the budget went to pay their salaries. The Navy's reputation was impaired due to the defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898. It was not until a decade later when the government started again to invest in new warships, however, the Navy was not ready to engage in warfare. Social unrest must also be mentioned, as a result of growing support of the labor movement and the appearance of left-wing republican parties, which may attempt to spark a republican revolution. A coup d'√©tat would be unfavorable to Spain. The Office Juli√°n Juder√≠as in 1918 The Office, was formed in, approximately, 1914 with six staff. A publication in a French newspaper, Le Petit Girondais, provoked an avalanche of letters from many Europeans asking for aid. This compelled the King to enlarge the Office to 48 staff members, all of them speaking several languages, assisted by many volunteers. A notable member of the Office was historian and translator Juli√°n Juder√≠as, who spoke 15 languages. The office worked in coordination with the Red Cross and was structured in several sections: * Missing People. *Information and Correspondence in Occupied Territories. *Prisoners. *Repatriations of Soldiers Severely Wounded or Sick. *Repatriations of Civilians. *Internment Service in Switzerland. *Pardons. *Commutations of Sentences. *Remittance of Funds to Individuals and Families in Occupied Territories. *Reports on Inspection Visits by Spanish Delegates. The Office admitted more than 200,000 letters ‚Äî140,000 of them from the families of soldiers‚Äî all of whom were answered thanks to, what Juan Jos√© Alonso Mart√≠n, director of the Palace General Archives, has described as \\"a primitive computing system.\\" The efforts of the King was not only to find people's relatives but to cease the practice of capital punishment. It is calculated that approximately 100 were saved from execution thanks to the Office ‚Äîincluding French and German soldiers. The King even tried to save Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his family, with no success. The Palace General Archives have more than 90 documents sent to St. Petersburg that proves the efforts to liberate or visit the Tsar ‚Äîthe Office's staff visited more than 4,000 prisoners over all Europe‚Äî but the Romanovs were already dead when the rescue operation began. However, the King was not sure of the fate of the Tsarina and her children so he and his Office continued. There is evidence that his efforts were instrumental in lifting the German invasion of Belgium, so that provisions from the United States could reach its nine million inhabitants. = Recognition = Diplomats involved in the operation received the Reconnaissance Fran√ßaise medal, the women received the Red Cross medal and the rest of the staff received the Order of Isabel the Catholic Queen. King Alfonso himself was thanked by the people of Belgium and Italy in 1923. He was also greatly admired around the world. A young English girl even wrote this prayer which appeared in a newspaper: \\"And God bless Father and Mother, and Nurse, and send Father back soon from his horrid prison in Germany. And God bless specially the dear King of Spain who found out about Father. Amen.\\" In 1917, King Alfonso was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, but it was given to the International Committee of the Red Cross. He was nominated again in 1933, when already in exile. In honor of its Royal status, Le Meurice Hotel has a room with his name, Suite Royale Alphonse XIII, where the acclaimed Spanish painter Salvador Dal√≠ spent one month every year for thirty years. Featured cases * French actor and singer Maurice Chevalier was taken prisoner in Germany; it was thank to the secret intervention of King Alfonso that he was released. * Russian ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky was arrested in Budapest, Hungary and was release thanks to the intervention, among other international leaders, of King Alfonso. * In the Royal Palace's archive exists a complaint about the bad situation of future French president Charles de Gaulle made by the Spanish inspectors and sent by the King to a war camp. * Being only 8-years-old, a French girl named Sylviane Sartor sent a letter to the King asking him to find her uncle, a war prisoner, saying that the deed would enlighten her mother. She said the following: \\"Your Majesty, Mother is crying all the time because her brother has been taken prisoner. She has just received a letter that says he will die of hunger. Your Majesty, if you could send him to Switzerland‚Ä¶ because Mother is certainly going to make herself ill. Your Majesty, I thank you in advance. Your servant, Sylviane\\". The King replied, asking for more information: \\"Dear Miss, I will do my best to stop your mother from crying. So be so good as to send me exact news of your uncle so that I can take the matter further. Alfonso XIII, King.\\" The prisoner was Achille Delmonte, found in a camp in Hanover, Germany and sent back to Switzerland with his family. *The French prime minister asked the King to attempt to get the repatriation of 20,000 French civilians that the war had suppressed in the enemy zone, and that they were to be deported to internment camps. Alfonso XIII achieved his liberation in several months, and France considered him a war hero ever since. *The efforts of the Office were unsuccessful in the search for John Kipling, the only son of the Nobel Prize for literature Rudyard Kipling. His remains were not found and identified until 1922.

In 1918, she was one of the first five women to be elected to the Landsting. The others were Nina Bang, Marie Christensen, Marie Hjelmer and Olga Knudsen. Biography Born in Randers on 25 October 1877, Inger Gautier was the daughter of the army veterinarian Johan Otto Christian Gautier (1848‚Äì1913) and Julie Wilhelmine Langballe (1843‚Äì1934). In April 1914, she married William Schmit, (1876‚Äì1942) a police chief, with whom she had five children. In 1881, she moved with her family to Copenhagen where she and her sisters became interested in music. She studied at the Music Conservatory from 1897 to 1899, continuing her studies in Berlin (1903‚Äì1904). While staying in the west of Jutland, she was inspired by the Inner Mission to give up music and concentrate on social work. From 1907, she became closely associated with Copenhagen's Magdalenehjemmet, an institution aimed at helping \\"fallen women\\" or prostitutes, taking on managerial functions. In parallel, she studied social affairs in London. After her marriage to William Schmit, she and her husband moved to Sams√∏ where she not only raised five children but became a member of the church council in Tranebjerg (1916‚Äì1920). She joined the Venstre party and became a member of their management committee. In 1918, despite little experience of politics, she was one of the first five women to be elected to the Landsting. Schmit quickly developed her political skills, proving to be an accomplished speaker. While Ventre was represented by three women in the Landsting, it was not represented by women in the Folketing until Schmit succeeded in being elected for N√¶stved in 1929. After being re-elected she remained there until 1945, ultimately becoming deputy chair. As a result of poor health, she did not stand in 1945 but was elected for Viborg in 1947 with large majority. With a total of 30 years in the Rigsdag, she completed one of the longest careers of the first generation of women parliamentarians. Inger Gautier Schmit died in Frederiksberg on 14 April 1963. She is buried in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery. Awards For her long years of service, Gautier was honoured with the Royal Medal of Recompense (gold) in 1949.

A characteristic of professional diving is the specification for minimum personnel for the diving support team. This typically specifies the minimum number of support team members and their appointed responsibilities in the team based on the circumstances and mode of diving, and the minimum qualifications for specified members of the diving support team. The minimum team requirements may be specified by regulation or code of practice. Some specific appointments within a professional dive team have defined competences and registration may be required. There is considerable difference in the diving procedures of professional divers, where a diving team with formally appointed members in specific roles and with recognised competence is required by law, and recreational diving, where in most jurisdictions the diver is not constrained by specific laws, and in many cases is not required to provide any evidence of competence. In recreational diving there may be no team at all for a solo diver, a dive buddy is the default arrangement, a three diver team is fairly common for technical diving, and a major technical dive or expedition may have a fairly complex team including surface support personnel made up to suit the requirements of the dive plan. Recreational diving instructors often use an assistant to increase the number of learners they can safely manage in the water, and dive guides may use an assistant to help keep the group together and assist the customers in an emergency.  Core diving team  These are the personnel that are generally required to be present at a professional dive site during the diving operation. = Working diver = Also referred to as the diver, this is the person who does the underwater work planned for the dive. There may be more than one working diver, and the working diver and bellman may alternate during a dive. Diving skills required depend on the mode of diving and equipment used, and work skills required depend on the job to be done. A working diver is by default necessary for a diving operation. Without the diver there is no diving operation. = Diving supervisor = The diving supervisor is the professional diving team member who is directly responsible for the diving operation's safety and the management of any incidents or accidents that may occur during the operation; the supervisor is required to be available at the control point of the diving operation for the diving operation's duration, and to manage the planned dive and any contingencies that may occur. Details of competence, requirements, qualifications, registration and formal appointment differ depending on jurisdiction and relevant codes of practice. Diving supervisors are used in commercial diving, military diving, public safety diving and scientific diving operations. A diving supervisor is required for every diving operation. The supervisor must remain in the control area and be in control at all times during the diving operation. This generally implies being able to communicate with the divers and other team members. = Standby diver = The diver who is at all times during the dive ready to go to the assistance of the working diver and perform a rescue to recover the diver to the surface if necessary. Diving competence requirements are identical to those of the working diver, but underwater work skills are not relevant while acting as standby diver. In surface oriented diving the standby diver may wait at the diving operation control point, and in saturation diving the bellman is the standby diver, though an additional surface standby diver may be required to assist with technical problems at shallow depths. A standby diver is required for every diving operation, though in some circumstances two working divers may act as standby to each other when working in close proximity, in an arrangement similar to the buddy system. = Diver's tender = The diver's tender, or dive attendant, is a person who may or may not be a qualified diver who assists the diver or standby diver to dress in and out, assists them entering and exiting the water, boarding the stage or wet bell, and manages the diver's umbilical at the surface where applicable. The bellman acts as the working diver's umbilical attendant from a wet or closed bell. In some circumstances, when untethered scuba is used, there may not be a requirement for a tender, and appropriate assistance may be provided by one of the other team members. In other cases, where the working diver is required to enter a confined space underwater, an additional underwater tender may be needed to handle the diver's umbilical at the entrance or other place where the risk of snagging is high. In some cases the stand-by diver may do this job. In these cases the underwater tender must be a suitably equipped and qualified diver, and will generally also need a surface tender in addition to the working diver's surface tender. = Diving medical practitioner = A registered diving medical practitioner competent to manage diving injuries may be required to be available on standby off-site during diving operations. The DMP should have certified skills and basic practical experience in assessment of medical fitness to dive, management of diving accidents, safety planning for professional diving operations, advanced life support, acute trauma care and general wound care. Depending on jurisdiction, a DMP may be required on telephonic standby for all commercial diving operations. For mixed gas and saturation diving the DMP should be competent to manage treatment for injuries associated with that class of diving.  Additional members depending on circumstances  The use of more complex equipment or diving modes may necessitate the inclusion of additional members in the diving team. Some of these are required to be registered operators, others are only required to be competent at their allocated tasks. = Compressor operator = For surface- supplied air diving using a low pressure compressor a competent person is needed to set up, start run and check the compressor and air delivery to the distribution panel. There may also be a high-pressure compressor for filling scuba cylinders and high pressure reserve air cylinders for divers or decompression chambers, and this too should be operated by a competent person. = Bellman = If an open or closed bell which provides gas to the diver from a bell panel is to be used to convey the divers to the worksite, a bellman is required. The bellman is a diver who acts as standby diver and diver's attendant from the bell during the dive, and may alternate as working diver during the dive if appropriately competent for the diving task. The bellman may be required to leave the bell to go to the assistance of the working diver, recover a disabled diver to the bell and provide first aid in the bell. Diving competence requirements are identical to those of the working diver, but underwater work skills are not relevant while acting as the bellman. = Launch and recovery system operator = A competent person responsible for operating the bell or stage lifting winch and launch and recovery system (LARS) is needed when such equipment is used. This is not a diving post. = Chamber operator = A chamber operator is needed if there is a decompression chamber on site. The chamber operator is a person competent to operate a hyperbaric chamber with a compressed air atmosphere under the direction of a diving supervisor. This is not a diving post, but the chamber operator may also be a diver, and many surface supplied air divers are also qualified as chamber operators. The chamber operator is competent to prepare the chamber for an operation, blow it down to depth, communicate with the occupants and the supervisor, operate the main and medical locks, provide decompression gases on the built-in breathing system, monitor and maintain the chamber atmosphere composition and pressure within the prescribed limits, manage contingencies, decompress to follow a specified surface decompression or recompression treatment schedule, and perform basic maintenance procedures, including cleaning and inspecting the components for correct function. = Gas man = A gas man, also called rack operator, is required when gas mixtures other than air are to be provided to the diver. This person controls the gas supply to the diver and may also handle communications as a direct assistant to the supervisor. The gas man may also be a diver, but the specific activity is not a diving post. = Diving medical technician = A diving medical technician is necessary where the diving operation is remote from hospital facilities, such as in offshore work. A diver medic or diving medical technician (DMT) is a member of a dive team who is trained in advanced first aid. A Diver Medic recognised by IMCA must be capable of administering First Aid and emergency treatment, and carrying out the directions of a doctor pending the arrival of more skilled medical aid, and therefore must be able to effectively communicate with a doctor who is not on site, and be familiar with diving procedures and compression chamber operation. The Diver Medic must also be able to assist the diving supervisor with decompression procedures, provide advice as to when more specialised medical help should be requested, and must be fit to provide treatment in a hyperbaric chamber in an emergency, and must therefore hold a valid certificate of medical fitness to dive. The diver medic may also be a diver, but this is not a diving appointment. Training standards for Diver Medic are described in the IMCA Scheme for Recognition of Diver Medic Training. = Systems technician = A person competent to maintain, repair and test the function of the diving and support systems and components for which they are appointed as systems technician. A systems technician would typically be required for a team operating a saturation system, or a surface supplied diving operation with a significant amount of support equipment, or relatively complex support equipment, or where a large number of dives are planned, and on-site maintenance and repair work is likely to be needed. This is not a diving appointment, though the technician may also be a diver. = Diving superintendent = The diving superintendent is the management position covering diving operations. The superintendent is usually a qualified supervisor, but depending on the organisation, may not be required to supervise dives. The superintendent may oversee saturation and surface oriented diving operations on air or mixed gases, develop and implement dive plans and diving related company procedures and manage diving related activities to minimise health, safety and environmental risks and impacts. This is not a diving appointment and the superintendent may not be directly involved in the actual diving operations. = Life support technician = A life support technician is a person registered as competent to operate the life-support systems of a mixed gas saturation diving system. Divers living in saturation conditions must be continuously monitored and the pressure, oxygen and carbon dioxide content of their breathing gas, and temperature and humidity of the environment must be monitored and controlled. Functions such as feeding and sewage disposal and locking stores and equipment into and out of the chambers are also controlled from outside by life support personnel. Responsibilities include communication with the divers in saturation, supervising transfer of personnel into and out of the accommodation chambers, maintaining the hyberbaric rescue craft and hyperbaric evacuation of the divers in an emergency. This is a non-diving post. = Life support supervisor = The life support supervisor is a senior life support technician appointed by the diving contractor to supervise operation of the saturation life support systems. This is a non-diving post.  ROV team  Whenever a remotely operated underwater vehicle is operated at a dive site when a diving operation is taking place, competent personnel are required to run the ROV, and as the safety of the divers is influenced, the ROV team is under the authority of the diving supervisor. The ROV can be both a hazard because of its mass, power and moving parts, and a benefit to diver safety, as it can monitor the divers on closed circuit video, and give some kinds of assistance in contingencies. There are a range of tasks where a ROV is more suitable than a diver, and others which a diver can do better. The ROV team are not necessarily divers, though it is possible. ROV operation requires a different set of skills and knowledge to diving. = ROV pilot = A person trained and competent to operate a remotely controlled underwater vehicle. In diving operations the pilot must be competent to safely operate the ROV with divers in the water. ROV pilots are usually also trained in routine maintenance and minor repair of the ROV. = ROV supervisor = A senior ROV pilot appointed to supervise the ROV team. The ROV supervisor is under the authority of the diving supervisor when divers are in the water, but may work autonomously when there is no diving taking place.  Legal status  When the minimum personnel in a diving team is regulated in terms of national or state legislation, the legal status and responsibilities of the members is generally defined in the legislation. These responsibilities often relate to occupational safety and health and specify a duty of care for the team members. Recreational diving In mainstream recreational diving, team diving is the exception. Support functions are carried out by operators such as dive boat charter operators, dive shops and dive schools, for their customers, on a commercial basis. Duty of care may be specifically limited by terms of use and waivers. Groups of divers may also associate in clubs and informal groups to finance or otherwise provide mutual services such as boats and filling facilities, and may dive together in informal groups. Club members may provide training and dive leadership to other club members, often on a not-for-profit cost sharing basis. Technical divers may form teams where this is appropriate to support each other for complex or hazardous dives. This can include surface co- coordinators, equipment handlers, gas blenders, support and standby divers, and any other function that may seem useful to them. The team members are not usually contractually bound and have no duty of care beyond what they may have voluntarily assumed and that of ordinary citizens. The divers remain responsible for their own assumption of risk and are not under the direction of anyone other than themselves and the dive plan by group consensus. Technical divers may also refer to team diving where a group of three divers assume the roles of dive buddies to each other.

History  The rebellion began on November 9, 1918 with the defeat of a punitive White detachment in the village of Dubenskoe. On November 11, the rebels captured the Cossack village of Karace. In mid-November they created a unified leadership and launched an attack on Minusinsk to defeat the punitive detachment of General Shilnikov there and establish Soviet power. On November 19, 7 detachments (about 10.000 people) under command of the Chief of the General Staff, V. Oshchepkov (a Corporal in the Tsarist army), attacked Minusinsk from three sides. However, the detachment of Shilnikov (about 3.000 soldiers) managed to repulse the persistent attacks of the rebels between 19 ‚Äì 21 of November. On November 27, the uprising was suppressed, and fights against individual detachments lasted until December 7. The defeat of the rebellion was due to poor armament (no artillery, only 2,000 rifles and a small number of cartridges) and inconsistent actions by the rebel detachments. The White military field court dealt brutally with the rebels: 87 people were shot, 50 forced into servitude, about 200 sentenced to imprisonment, and some 300 to a large fine. The main mass of surviving rebels went to the woods and continued a guerrilla struggle from there.

Description The length of the shell attains 38 mm, its diameter 11.4 mm. (Original description) The shell is of moderate size for the genus, fusiform, the maximum diameter in front of the median horizontal. The aperture is approximately half the total altitude. The shell contains about 11 whorls. The protoconch is small but rather high, twice coiled. The initial turn is erect, submerged only at the extreme tip, slightly bulbous. The succeeding volution is high, increasingly compressed laterally. The line of demarcation between the conch and the protoconch is defined by the initiation of a faint peripheral ridge a little in front of the median line of the whorl, a ridge which becomes increasingly prominent and near the end of the first whorl of the conch is defined by a faint sulcus and threadlet behind it. A feeble spiral is also introduced near the end of the first whorl directly behind the anterior suture line and within half a turn, another directly in front of the posterior suture, neither one of them attaining any prominence. The adult whorls are bicarinate, the spiral directly behind the periphery increasing in strength until it is almost or quite as elevated as the peripheral keel, from which it is separated by a rather narrow, concave interspiral area. This is sculptured with protractive incrementals and in places a fortuitous spiral threadlet. The area between the suture and the posterior keel is strongly concave, sculptured with 2 faint spirals, both of them introduced near the beginning of the conch, the one a little in front of the suture, the other at an equal distance behind the posterior carina, and between them a smoothly concave interspace striated with strongly and symmetrically arcuate incrementals and a few very faint spiral lirae. Microscopic spirals are also present directly in front of the posterior suture and on the concave space between the anterior keel and the anterior suture. Two additional primaries are shown equal in prominence and spacing to the carinal spirals, upon the body, and about 12 similar primaries, regularly spaced and gradually decreasing in size anteriorly, upon the very base of the body and the columella. Secondaries are intercalated on the columella, in some specimens as many as 3 between a single pair of primaries, and a very fine threading upon the fasciole. The suture line is distinct but inconspicuous, overhung by the periphery. The aperture is pyriform, abruptly expanding posteriorly. The siphonal notch is placed midway between the posterior carina and the suture line, U-shaped, with parallel sides, the anterior limb more produced than the posterior. The parietal wall is thinly glazed. The anterior canal is long, very slightly curved, with proximate parallel margins.Gardner J.A. (1937). The molluscan fauna of the Alum Bluff Group of Florida.

Taken prisoner after the Battle of Culloden in April 1746, he was released in 1747 and later held a senior legal post in the Provencal Regional Parliament. He was exiled from France in 1763 for opposing the suppression of the Jesuits but allowed to return in 1768 and died at home in March 1783.  Life  Alexandre Jean- Baptiste de Boyer, later Seigneur or Marquis d‚Äô√âguilles, was born on 29 March 1709, at the family home in the southern French town of Aix-en-Provence, the H√¥tel Boyer d'√âguilles. He was the third of five sons of Pierre-Jean de Boyer (died 1757) and Ang√©lique de L'Enfant, daughter of Luc de L'Enfant (1656‚Äì1729), President of the Regional Parliament. thumbleft150px alt=An official dressed as a 'noble of the robe'An official dressed as a Noblesse de robe; d‚Äô√âguilles came from this class Pierre-Jean was Procureur g√©n√©ral or Attorney-General for the Regional Parliament of Provence and a member of the Noblesse de robe or Nobles of the robe. This class formed the Second Estate whose rank derived from holding judicial or administrative posts and were often hard-working professionals, unlike the aristocratic Noblesse d'√©p√©e or Nobles of the Sword. By the mid-18th century, many of these positions had become hereditary and eldest sons were expected to succeed their fathers, marry and have children. Instead, Alexandre's elder brother Jean-Baptiste, Marquis d'Argens, defied his father by choosing a military career. Unlike the rest of his family, who were devout Catholics, he became an atheist philosopher, writer and friend of Voltaire and later wrote 'I was not my father's favourite child.' He was formally disinherited in 1734, an act that profoundly changed the life of his younger brother but despite their philosophical differences, the two were close friends throughout their lives. To prevent the division of family estates amongst multiple heirs, younger sons often remained unmarried; the second son Paul (1708‚Äì1785) became a priest, while Alexandre, Sextus (1710‚Äì?) and Luc (1713‚Äì1772) joined the Knights of Malta. As Paul was committed to the Church, Alexandre became 'Marquis D'√âguilles' when their father died in 1757, although Jean-Baptiste retained the title 'Marquis d'Argens'. In May 1740, he married Marie-Anne Rousseau (1714‚Äì1741), who died in childbirth; he re-married in June 1748, this time to an English lady, Catherine Stanhope (or Wannup) (1726‚Äì1761). They had two sons who survived childhood, Pierre-Jean (1753‚Äì1823) and Paul-Luc (1754‚Äì1820). Career Maltese Navy thumbright150px alt=D'Eguilles' elder brother, philosopher and author the Marquis d'ArgensD'Eguilles' elder brother, philosopher and author Jean-Baptiste, Marquis d'Argens In 1725, D'Eguilles joined the Maltese Navy, maritime arm of the Knights of Malta. Originally formed to provide security against pirates based on the Barbary Coast, by the 18th century its activities had expanded to include raiding Muslim merchants in the Eastern Mediterranean. Various members of the de Boyer family had a background in the arts, including their great-uncle, the poet and dramatist Abbe Claude de Boyer (1618‚Äì1698). Their grandfather, Jean-Baptiste de Boyer (1640‚Äì1709), owned a famous art collection containing works by Titian, Caravaggio, Michelangelo, Van Dyck, Poussin, Rubens and Corregio. In 1736, these connections led to D‚Äô√âguilles' election to the Acad√©mie de Marseille, a society for the Provencal intellectual and social elite and he was appointed President in 1739. His brother had been disinherited in 1734 but it was not until 1740 that D‚Äô√âguilles gave up his naval career and married Marie-Anne Rousseau. However, he had not received the legal education required to follow his father and instead tried a number of unsuccessful business ventures, including trading olive oil with the Americas and opening a theatre. When his first wife died in childbirth in 1741, D‚Äô√âguilles was involved in the production of a two volume guide to his grandfathers' art collection, including copies of the paintings done by the French engraver Pierre-Jean Mariette. With little connecting him to Provence, he took the opportunity provided by this work to spend time in Paris, where he gained access to the literary salon headed by Louis de Bachaumont. The two became friends and Bachaumont recommended him to the French foreign minister, Jean-Jacques Amelot. The 1740‚Äì1748 War of the Austrian Succession was then in progress and D‚Äô√âguilles was employed carrying messages to the French envoys in Berlin and Dresden. Amelot was dismissed in May 1743 and replaced in November 1744 by Ren√© D'Argenson, who served in the army with his brother, the Marquis d'Argens. In July 1745, Prince Charles landed in Scotland, launching the 1745 Jacobite rising and D'Argenson asked D‚Äô√âguilles to go there as an unofficial envoy; not being a professional diplomat made it easier to disown him if needed but he was hampered in his mission by the inability to speak English. He left Dunkirk on 26 September on board the French privateer l'√âsperance, with two other ships carrying weapons and money, arriving in Edinburgh on 14 October. He claimed to simply be a gentleman 'driven by adventure,' but Charles introduced him as Ambassador, using him as proof of French support for the Rising. Battle of Culloden, April 1746; D'Eguilles was taken prisoner and not released until 1747 In a letter to D'Argenson of 23 October, D'Eguilles concluded the Jacobite position was hopeless without a French invasion.Gibson, p.48 He was present at the meetings held in Edinburgh on 30 and 31 October to discuss the invasion of England, which revealed deep divisions between Charles and his Scots supporters. Many Scots joined the rebellion hoping to dissolve the 1707 Union with England; this now seemed achievable and although they were willing to assist an English rising or French invasion, they would not do it on their own. D'Eguilles assured Charles of his support for the invasion, but told the Scots in private it was a mistake; Lord Elcho later wrote \\"...the majority of the Council (wanted to) remain in Scotland to watch events and defend their own land. This was also the opinion in secret of the Marquis d‚ÄòEguilles.\\" 18th century Jesuit father; support for the Society of Jesus led to D‚Äô√âguilles exile from France between 1763‚Äì1768 After the Battle of Culloden in April 1746, he was captured and held in Carlisle for six months while the British and French governments arranged terms of exchange. In June 1747, D‚Äô√âguilles wrote a report on the rising to Count Maurepas, the Naval Minister. With few exceptions, this was extremely critical of both the Scots and Jacobite exiles, while his opinion of Charles himself was so low that one option he suggested was the establishment of a Scots Republic, rather than a Stuart restoration. He lobbied for another diplomatic post but D'Argenson had been replaced by de Puisieulx, while the French government now wanted to disassociate themselves from any connection with the Rising. Their support for the Stuarts had become a major obstacle in the peace negotiations that ended with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. D‚Äô√âguilles returned to Provence where his father purchased him the office of Pr√©sident √† mortier in the Provencal Parliament, one of the most senior legal posts in pre-1789 France. In 1748, he married Catherine Stanhope or Wannup, whom he met during his time in England; she died in 1761, which was followed two years later by an upheaval in his public career. Like many devout Catholics, the de Boyers were supporters of the Society of Jesus or Jesuits; D‚Äô√âguilles and his brothers had been educated by Jesuit tutors. However, increasing economic and political power brought them enemies, in France and elsewhere; when the Jesuit mission in Martinique went bankrupt in 1760, the Society in Paris denied responsibility for their debts, leading to calls for their suppression. In 1762, legal proceedings were filed against them in the Provencal Parliament but blocked by D‚Äô√âguilles in his capacity of Pr√©sident √† mortier; in May 1763, he was forced to resign and letters he published backing the Jesuits were burned by the public hangman. He was banished from France 'in perpetuity,' joining his brother at the court of Frederick the Great; as Voltaire remarked, one brother was exiled for opposing the Jesuits, the other for supporting them. After D‚Äô√âguilles returned home in 1767, he offered to reverse the 1734 legal order disinheriting his elder brother, an offer that was refused. His return from exile was conditional on remaining in Provence; he spent the rest of his life living quietly in retirement at the family chateau in √âguilles, where he died on 8 October 1783. Legacy His son and heir, Pierre-Jean de Boyer, emigrated in 1791 during the French Revolution and his estates were confiscated, divided into 50 lots, then distributed to local farmers. His attempts to reclaim these lands after the 1814 restoration of Louis XVIII led to protracted legal disputes. The H√¥tel Boyer d'√âguilles was built in 1675 to a design by the Baroque artist Pierre Puget, who lived in Marseille and contains ceilings attributed to the painter and artist S√©bastien Barras; it is now a protected monument.

Emerging during the Industrial Revolution, corons were a form of low- cost dwelling commonly found in coal mining and steelmaking regions of Wallonia and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Originating as a form of vernacular architecture, their design and materials were increasingly upgraded over time and some were even constructed as parts of purpose-built model villages. They can be considered a counterpart of the back-to-back housing found in industrial parts of the United Kingdom. Over a hundred coron sites are listed as World Heritage sites in Northern France selected by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  Origins and etymology  The term originates from the Walloon language 'coron' (itself from Latin 'cornus' meaning 'corner') denoting the edge or corner of a street and, by extrapolation, a working-class district. The emergence of the corons was instigated in the nineteenth century in metropolitan France‚Äôs Northern Departments now constituting the Hauts-de-France region (French pronunciation: [o d(…ô) f Å…ëÃÉs], translating to \\"Upper France\\" in English; Picard: Heuts-d'Franche), following the territorial reform of French Regions (2014) from a merger of Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardy. The activity was ubiquitous in the towns of the former Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin including Lewarde and the sites.  Description  Different types of corons coexisted. Some represented real advances for the time in terms of protecting inhabitants from cholera outbreaks. Today, successive renovations make corons sought after.

Breccia remains from volcanic eruptions 1.7 billion years ago in collapsed pits. Dikes, sills and pillow lavas near the Hart River formed in connection with crustal extension 1.32 billion years ago. The 2.5 kilometer thick Pinguicula Group sandstone, dolomite, siltstone and shale deposited 1.27 billion years ago. The sedimentary rock contains a 200 million year gap after the Pinguicula Group. The Mackenzie Mountains Supergroup in the east and the Fifteenmile Group in the west deposited with carbonates, sandstone, siltstone and shale around one billion years ago. Regional folding, which produced the Corn Creek orogeny took place around 900 million years ago, leaving behind interlaced transcurrent faults in the vicinity of the current day Snake River. This interpretation is supported by a low angle unconformity underneath the Callison Lake Dolomite in the south of the Ogilvie Mountains. The Yukon was part of the supercontinent Rodinia until began to break up 850 million years ago, separating the proto-North American continent of Laurentia. The continental breakup is marked by basalt flows from 778 million years ago in the Mackenzie Mountains in the Northwest Territories. The Coates Lake Group records shallow water gypsum, limestone and sandstone formed at the equator while the Mount Harper Group is indicative of sub-sea volcanism. Around 718 million years ago, these units were capped with dacite associated with the Franklin dike swarms and the doming of the western Arctic. Glacial material in the Rapitan Group deposited below water during the Sturtian glaciation, one of the two main glaciations with in the Cryogenian Snowball Earth period. The rocks of the group include iron-rich sediments and a carbonate cap. Ediacaran multicellular life (the first multicellular organism) and blue-green algae appear in carbonate and siltstone within the Windermere Supergroup which deposited between the glaciations. As Laurentia drifted, a passive continental margin developed with significant sedimentation. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= In the early Paleozoic, the Mackenzie Platform accumulated material, including deep water sediments in the Cambrian in the vicinity of Mayo and Dawson. Regional crustal extension formed the Redstone Arch (now present in the Mackenzie Mountains) as well as embayments found along the provincial line with Northwest Territories and British Columbia. Thick carbonates such as the Bouvette Formation in the north or the eastern Sunblood Formation formed in slowly subsiding sections of both the Macdonald and Mackenzie platforms. The Tintina Fault shifted the Cassiar Terrane‚Äîa 60 kilometer wide section of carbonates on continental crust north up to 490 kilometers, where it now forms a part of the Pelly Mountains in the center of the territory. The creation of the Selwyn Basin brought deposition which records many of the events of the Paleozoic. The sand, limestone and shale of the Hyland Group formed first, ascending into the Cambrian Vampire Formation platform edge limestone and the Gull Lake Formation basalt. The Rabbitkettle and Crow formations deposited with sandstone and limestone into the Ordovician during a marine transgression. The Misty Creek embayment in the south Ogilvie Mountains and the edge of the basin in Faro have alkali basalts erupted during the period. Into the Devonian, the Road River Group chert, siltstone and mudstone built up in the basin, supplied with high temperature brines from seafloor vents which created zinc-lead deposits in Howards Pass and Anvil Ridge. Similar sediments are exposed in the Richardson Mountains in the north. In the Middle Devonian, 390 million years ago, eastern Yukon was blanketed in sandstone, black shale and siltstone during a major marine advance. However, the Selwyn Basin was uplifted, leading to erosion of a chert-pebble conglomerate in the Earne Group which may have been carried along submarine canyons to the Macmillan Pass. The Earne Group includes zinc-lead and barite deposits generated by deep sea fissure vents. In the southeast and in the Ogilvie Mountains, the Keno Hill Quartzite and sandstone-mudstone Mattson Formation accumulated from Carboniferous river deltas carrying eroded material from a landmass to the north. By the Pennsylvanian, a platform environment had returned with carbonate deposition in the east and north. Northern Yukon, together with the Seward Peninsula and Brooks Range in Alaska are underlain by the Arctic Alaska Terrane. Its component, the North Slope subterrane underlies the Yukon's British Mountains, extends north into the Beaufort Sea and extends as far south as the Porcupine River. The exotic origins of the terrane remain unclear, although it is proposed to have developed between Siberia and Laurentia and likely collided in the Devonian. It has thick layers of siltstone, slate, chert and limestone from the Neoproterozoic to the Devonian which form the core of the British Mountains. Deposited on the Franklinian margin, the oldest are overlain by sandstone and silt in the Cambrian Neruokpuk Formation. The collision of the terrane spurred the Romanzof orogeny, uplifting the rocks and driving erosion, leading to a Mississippian unconformity. The thickening of the crust during the orogeny caused melting and granite intrusions visible at Hoidahl Mountain, Old Crow Range and Mount Sedgwick. Around the same time in the mid-Paleozoic, the \\"Intermontane terranes\\" that underlie the Yukon Plateau in the central part of the territory were added to the Laurentian margin. Most of the terranes originated as part of the Panthalassa Ocean, the proto-Pacific Ocean. The Cache Creek terrane is near the center and is the remains of oceanic crust, in the form of basalt, argillite, chert, gabbro, various ultramafic rocks and limestone dating from the Pennsylvanian to the Jurassic. The Yukon-Tanana and Slide Mountain terranes accreted between the Devonian and the Triassic. The Snowcap Assemblage metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Yukon-Tanana terrane is overlain by Finlayson, Klinkit and Klondike metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. The Snowcap Assemblage and even some overlying rocks are intruded with Devonian-Mississippian granodiorite, tonalite and granite. The Finlayson Lake district preserves the Slide Mountain Terrane which has chert, greenstone, phyllite, conglomerate and metavolcanic rocks in the Fortin Creek Group overlain by chert, limestone, argillite and quartzite as well as gabbro and ultramafic rocks. Eclogite from 270 million years provides evidence that the Slide Mountain Terrane subducted beneath the Yukon-Tanana Terrane. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= In the Mesozoic, through the early Jurassic, platform conditions persisted in the east and north, as chert shale, sandstone and carbonate built up the Mount Christie and Fantasque formations, overlain by Jones Lake and Grayling-Toad formation shales. The Cache Creek Terrane (which extends as far north as Whitehorse) was surrounded on either side by the Stikinia and Quesnellia terranes. Because both include Triassic augite, have Paleozoic volcanic rocks and are juxtaposed along the Teslin Fault, the two terranes are difficult to distinguish. Southwest Yukon built up with addition of exotic terranes in the Mesozoic, uplifting the platform and resulting in erosion of older sedimentary units. As the Stikinia, Cache Creek and Quesnellia terranes converged in the Middle Jurassic the Whitehorse Trough developed as a basin, filling with three kilometers of Laberge Group sandstone, conglomerate, shale, coal, deep-water turbidite and Nordienskiold Formation pyroclastic flows. The Laberge Group overlies the Quesnellia and Stikinia terranes unconformably and had Jurassic-age volcanism around it during its formation. Tantalus Formation coal, sandstone and conglomerate from the early Cretaceous marks the final filling of the trough. Two terranes, held together by a Middle Pennsylvanian pluton collided with the western edge of Laurentia in the Middle Jurassic. The Alexander terrane is made up of Cambrian-Ordovician quartz sandstone, limestone and mafic volcanic rocks, Ordovician-Silurian carbonates, siltstone and calcareous mudstone, as well as Devonian-Triassic siltstone, sandstone and carbonate. Geologists have subdivided the Alexander terrane into the Saint Elias subterrane in the Yukon and British Columbia (the Craig subterrane is located in Alaska). Some have suggested that the two subterranes were rifted off of Baltica and then brought together during the Silurian-Devonian Klakas orogeny. The Wrangellia terrane linked with the Alexander is somewhat younger. Early Mississippian tuff, breccia, volcaniclastic sandstone and mafic volcanic rocks in the Skolai Group are the oldest rocks. The Skolai Group is separated from overlying Middle Triassic siltstone by a regional unconformity. Above the siltstone is the vast Nikolai Formation‚Äîbasal conglomerate and basalt three kilometers thick, which extends far to the west into Alaska and as far south as Vancouver Island. It is interlayered with the Chitistone reef limestone and the deep marine McCarthy Formation. Nickel, copper and platinum group elements formed in ultramafic intrusions within the Nikolai Formation, deposited as gabbro, pyroxenite and dunite as the Kluane mafic-ultramafic complex. During the Triassic, rifting may have briefly separated the two terrains before they rejoined, a possibility inferred from the Duke River Fault \\"suture\\" between the two terranes. The two terranes have overlap assemblages with rocks formed across the two landmasses. The thick Dezadesh Formation turbidite and tuff deposited in a basin from the late Jurassic into the early Cretaceous. In the early Cretaceous, a northwest-trending pluton belt intruded the Saint Elias subterrane along with the Kluane Ranges suite which intruded both terranes. The rocks are I-type calc-alkaline with copper porphyry, gold skarn and copper-molybdenum deposits. To the northeast of the Denali Fault, the Dawson Range and Whitehorse suites batholith generates the gold, copper and silver of Whitehorse Copper Belt. Further inland is the Cassiar suite and the Hyland and Anvil suites. The second group includes peraluminous granite with tungsten- molybdenum skarns intruding ancient North American rocks. The South Fork Volcanics for a large igneous complex north of the Ross River. The most inland Cretaceous plutons are the Mayo, Tungsten and Tombstone suites northeast of the Tintina faults, intruding older rocks deposited in the Selwyn Basin. The 97 to 94 million year old Tungsten suite has peraluminous granite with scheelite skarn deposits, while the 95 to 92 million year old Mayo suite extends to the northwest. The Tombstone suite is the youngest of the three, north of Dawson, with significant monzonite and syenite and a gold deposit at Brewery Creek. Copper-gold porphyry, basalt and basalt andesite are particularly common in small plutons in between the Denali and Tintina faults on the Yukon Plateau. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= From the Paleocene into the Oligocene, the conglomerate, coal seams and sandstone of the Amphitheatre Formation deposited atop the Alexander and Wrangellia terranes in a basin that developed along the Denali Fault. Placer gold accumulated within the conglomerate and then eroded out and became new placer material within the Kluane Ranges. During the Miocene, andesite, basalt and volcaniclastic rocks erupted as the Pacific Plate subducted beneath Alaska and the Yukon. The Ruby Range suite pluton formed the core of the Coast Plutonic Complex with tonalite and granodiorite between 64 and 56 million years ago, with significant copper-molybdenum porphyry and epithermal mineralization. Close to the Mount Skokum gold mine, the south Dawson Range and the Sifton Range west of Whitehorse have the Eocene felsic volcanic rocks of the Skukum Group. In the Oligocene, the Yakutat terrane, a section of Cretaceous flysch and m√©lange together with Paleogene basalt from the Pacific Plate split off the western edge of the Canadian Cordillera and added on to the western edge of the Yukon. The Chugach terrane, with siltstone, argillite and sandstone trench fill from the Cretaceous and early Paleogene layered on top of the Yakutat terrane along the Border Ranges Fault. The fault is interpreted as the subduction zone fault shifted onto land by the Yakutat collision. Volcanic activity continued until the Miocene, eight million years ago, with the Miles Canyon Basalt. The youngest volcanic rocks are the less than three million year old Watson Lake, Rancheria and Selkirk basalt flows.

The concept of STA was introduced in a 2010 paper by Xi Chen et al. Their design can be achieved using a variety of techniques. A universal approach is provided by counterdiabatic driving, also known as transitionless quantum driving. Motivated by one of authors systematic study of dissipative Landau-Zener transition, the key idea was demonstrated earlier by a group of scientists from China, Greece and USA in 2000, as steering an eigenstate to destination. Counterdiabatic driving has been demonstrated in the laboratory using a time- dependent quantum oscillator. The use of counterdiabatic driving requires to diagonalize the system Hamiltonian, limiting its use in many-particle systems. In the control of trapped quantum fluids, the use of symmetries such as scale invariance and the associated conserved quantities has allowed to circumvent this requirement. STA have also found applications in finite-time quantum thermodynamics to suppress quantum friction. Fast nonadiabatic strokes of a quantum engine have been implemented using a three-dimensional interacting Fermi gas. The use of STA has also been suggested to drive a quantum phase transition. In this context, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts the formation of topological defects. While the implementation of counterdiabatic driving across a phase transition requires complex many-body interactions, feasible approximate controls can be found.

History  Cap comforters were introduced in the late 19th century as informal working headdress for British soldiers performing manual labour at camp, and as a comfortable undress cap on active service. = First World War = Trenchraiders wearing capcomforters in various ways in 1916 Cap comforters were worn during the First World War as a warm alternative to the service dress cap, as the fabric could be pulled low over the ears in the cold winter trenches. Their casual and non-rigid silhouette made them an ideal item for night time trench raids. = Second World War = In the Second World War, soldiers from many British Army regiments wore cap comforters, particularly during training or when engaged in manual tasks.  Commandos  The Commando Memorial depicts three soldiers wearing the cap comforter The British commandos were an international force recruited from across various Allied units, many with distinctive headdresses. As a solution to this lack of uniformity, commando units adopted their own practical headgear. No.1Commando chose the green beret in imitation of the Royal Armoured Corps, whereas No.2 and No.9 adopted the Scottish tam o' shanter. Other units, including No.4Commando (and US Army Rangers attached during the Dieppe Raid), adopted the cap comforter as their headdress, because it had no prior affiliation with a nation or regiment. In autumn 1942, the War Office approved the green beret as the official commando headgear, though the cap comforter continued to be worn, already synonymous with the apparel of the commandos. = Post-war = The British Army has stopped issuing cap comforters, replacing them instead with headovershttps://www.anchorsupplies.com/british- army-headover.html  similar items based on Wehrmacht toques.

It was published in English in 2016 by Archipelago Books, with the translation by Jordan Stump. It discusses the author's personal experiences with the Hutu-Tutsi conflict, which culminated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Mukasonga referred to it as a \\"paper grave\\" to reflect how she escaped the situation and in memorial for her deceased relatives.  Cited: p. 27 The title \\"Cockroaches\\" was an insult against Tutsis uttered during the conflict. Contents The initial chapters discuss life after her family, Tutsis, was removed from their hometown in pogroms which began to be held in 1959; the first chapter discusses the pogroms.Hoffert, p. 71. The book also discusses her high school period at Lyc√©e Notre-Dame-de-Citeaux, in which she was mistreated for being a Tutsi. Mukasonga went to France in 1986 and was unable to assist her family members who perished in the genocide. When the author came back to Rwanda, she found that her family's former residence was cleared away. She recalls the names of the deceased in a notebook she is writing on while visiting Gitagata and Gitwe, which were reduced to ruins. The book ends with a description of a snake she finds that she uses to symbolise the endurance of what the g√©nocidaires tried to destroy.  Cited: p. 29 She lists names of deceased friends and acquaintances in the final paragraph as a memorial.

According to the first description of this genus, the etymology of its name derives from Greek words \\"kopros\\", meaning dung, from the source where one of the species (Coprothermobacter proteolyticus) was isolated, and \\"thermos\\", meaning hot, warm, because of the relatively high temperatures at which these bacteria are able to grow, which can be as high as 75¬∞C. Actually, very few known bacterial species are included in this genus, which are characterized by sharing genetic information with microorganisms belonging to Archaea, a taxonomic domain separate from the domain Bacteria. For this reason, Coprothermobacteria are considered a diverging lineage of bacteria.

It discusses the author's childhood in the Philippines, including bouts of poverty and struggle after initially having an affluent life. Chronology Barnes initially grew up in a wealthy family in the Manila metropolitan area;  Issue: March 1, 2018. Her father derived his income from the petrochemical business, and he began dating their mother after their initial 1985 meeting. Beginning when Barnes was three years old, she and her family resided in the Mansion Royale, located in Antipolo. Barnes' family had servants. The family's economic standing declined due to the 1991 Gulf War. The family converts the Mansion Royale into an events venue to generate revenue, but the father leaves the Philippines after a monsoon destroys the house. The mother gets into an abusive relationship with another man, Norman, who steals a student taxi business set up by Barnes and her brother Paolo. Norman joins a guerilla group, before Barnes leaves with her brother to live with her half sister. Background Barnes had moved to New York after the events of the book; while in the latter period of her teenage years, she had been adopted by a person in her father's side of the family. She attended university in New York, where she met her future husband. She moved to the Southern United States after getting her degree, and gave birth to a daughter. Barnes decided to write the memoir when she felt a comeback of her childhood memories during postpartum depression. Barnes's husband stated that she could write her memories down. She wrote her memories on a series of 3x5 notecards purchased by her husband, and she placed them in shoeboxes. When she attended a master of fine arts (MFA) program at Converse College, her mentor suggested that she create a piece of writing based on information that she had not previously disclosed to another person. This prompted her to begin writing a book based on the notecards. She did additional research through interviewing her father and other family members and by consulting public records of court cases, births, and deaths, as well as queries on Google Earth. Her father suffered a stroke shortly after his interview. Barnes's mentor submitted a draft of the work in secret, and the work was formally submitted to Little A in 2016. Barnes's literary agent told her to keep the work in consideration, citing the atmosphere in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, after Barnes's daughter went to the hospital the week of the submission and Barnes had thoughts of revoking the book's submission.

She is most-known as a patron of culture and for the work she did to promote Kyrgyz arts to international audiences. She was honored as a Hero of the Kyrgyz Republic, twice honored with the Order of Manas in the 1st and 3rd degrees, decorated as a Commander of the Order of Lenin and was twice awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. Early life Kuluypa Konduchalova was born on 15 June 1920 in the village of Kara-Jygach, (now located in the Alam√ºd√ºn District, Chuy Region) in the Kyrgyz area of the Russian Empire. One of nine siblings, only she and her two brothers, Iskender and Seideh, survived. Her father was a carpenter and craftsman, and encouraged her in her desire for an education. She began her schooling at the newly opened rural school in Kara-Jygach in 1928 and was inspired by her first teacher to become an educator. When she was twelve, she moved to Frunze and entered the Kyrgyz State Pedagogical Institute, graduating in 1938. Career After completing her studies, Konduchalova worked as a teacher first being placed in a boarding school in Kulanak. After one year of serving as the head teacher, she was promoted as the school director. Joining the Kyrgyk Communist Party in 1940, Konduchalova was appointed as the Tien- Shan Regional secretary of the Komsomol. She did not want the post, but could not refuse and began lecture tours for the Party. In 1942, she was lecturing in Leningrad during the siege of the city. Between 1943 and 1945, Konduchalova studied in Moscow at the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Higher Party School, at the same time as the well-known Kazak journalist, Aytkesh Toiganbayev. Despite the war, Konduchalova later remembered fondly the numerous cultural events she and her classmates attended. She married Abdi Orolbayev, a financier, with whom she would have a son, Diyas, and two daughters, Gylzhamal and Irina. Returning home at the end of the war, Konduchalova first worked in the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1947, she was appointed as the Agitprop secretary for the Jalal-Abad Regional Committee of the Communist Party. Serving in the post through 1949, she simultaneously was appointed in 1948 as the secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Kirghiz SSR. From 1947, she served as a deputy in the Kirghiz Supreme Soviet, acting as Deputy Chair of that body from 1949 to 1952. In 1953, she became the Kyrzyk Minister of Foreign Affairs and the following year, though she continued serving as a deputy in the Kirghiz Supreme Soviet, was elected as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs took on an important role at this time, because the only Soviet Republics recognized by the United Nations after the war were Belarus and Ukraine. As the centralized structure had collapsed during the war, Konduchalova became responsible for insuring that Kyrzyk diplomats were informed on international developments and law, had proficiency in English and French, and were provided with the necessary materials from TASS to perform their duties. From 1958 Konduchalova headed the Ministry of Culture and in that year organized the 2nd Decade of Kyrgyz Art and Literature, which performed in Moscow, the first Kyrgyz performance in Russia since the war ended. Some of the most-known Kyrgyz performers of the 1960s and 1970s participated in the show, including Bubusara Beyshenalieva, , and , all of whom would become People's Artist of the Kirghiz SSR or USSR, among others. She organized weekly artistic and literary events and performances from the beginning of the 1960s to promote the country's cultural heritage. Konduchalova organized cultural exchange activities and exhibitions throughout the Soviet republics, but also abroad, traveling to Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Sweden and Syria. Within the country over the next two decades, she directed the Ministry to establish over 2,500 libraries; over 1,000 cinemas; 220 local houses of culture; 97 institutions to promote cultural education in the arts, dance and music; 6 theaters for dramatic presentation; 6 museums; 3 publishing houses; and the Kyrgyk Philharmonic Society. Konduchalova also promoted the development of architectural monuments, including the Friendship Monument(ky) and the Monument to Revolutionary Heroes. In 1966, she became Chair of the Society for the Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments, to promote conservation of cultural heritage in the country. After her retirement from the Ministry, in 1980, Konduchalova continued her work with the Society for the Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments. Among the many awards bestowed upon Kondychalova, she was honored with the Order of Lenin, twice received the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and the Order of the Badge of Honor from the USSR. In her own country, she was knighted twice receiving the Order of Manas in both the 1st and 3rd degree. In 2010, she received the highest national honor, Hero of the Kyrgyz Republic with the special distinction \\"Ak-Shumkar\\", from President Roza Otunbayeva In 2011, Munduzbek Tentimishev published the biography –õ–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–ª—É—É ”©–º“Ø—Ä: –ö“Ø–ª“Ø–π–ø–∞ –ö–æ–Ω–¥—É—á–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞ (Legendary Life: Kuluypa Konduchalova), dedicated to one of the few women who rose in political rank in her era.

The word Velodrom comes from Velodrome, the French word for cycle racing track. History The trigger for development of the site at Arnulfsplatz 195bJens Friedrich, Florian Stetter und Wolfram Ney: Das Velodrom in Regensburg: seine Geschichte vom Variete-Theater zur Ruine Arbeit aus dem Denkmalwettbewerb 1995 der Stadt Regensburg. [available at: Universit√§tsbibliothek Regensburg, Sig. 00/NS 3105 F911] was provided by businessman and bicyclist Simon Oberdorfer. He hired the young architect Joseph Koch for planning. Founded in 1891, the building first served as a hall for various cycling demonstrations for the Wanderer-Radler-Verein (Walking & Cycling Club) including artistic cycling presentations by Oberdorfer himself. In the course of planning, the idea developed to build an event center. The approval dragged on, as the city magistrate repeatedly criticized the unfavorable fire escape situation due to close quarters. Only action by Adolf Schmetzer on October 1, 1897 brought the breakthrough to obtain preliminary approval. Nevertheless, there were still a few legal pitfalls waiting. It was not until 1898, after a short construction period, that the opening took place. Initially the Velodrom was used for many classical events with variety, dance and artistry demonstrations. Part of the variety program was artistic cycling by so-called \\"eccentric-cyclists\\", even bicycle races were included.Susanne Hansch: Variet√©-T√§nzerinnen, Salon-Humoristen und Excentric- Radfahrer. Edition vulpes e.K. Regensburg (2000), . So in fact the building at least partially served the initial purpose and justified its name. The hall was also rented for major social events. Thus, it was also used in 1904 for the General Assembly of German Catholics (51st Catholic Day).Silvia Codreanu- Windauer, Lutz Dallmeier u. a. Das Velodrom; Die Geschichte eines Regensburger Geb√§udes. Planungs- und Baureferat der Stadt Regensburg, Regensburg 2000. In addition, Oberdorfer hosted Social Democrats, who had no other meeting place in church-dominated Regensburg. Georg von Vollmar , Kurt Eisner , Erhard Auer and Toni Pf√ºlf also spoke here.Karl Bauer: Regensburg Kunst- Kultur- und Alltagsgeschichte. 6. Auflage. MZ-Buchverlag in H. Gietl Verlag & Publikationsservice GmbH, Regenstauf 2014, , S. 411 f. In 1929, Oberdorfer had the Velodrom converted into the \\"Capitol Cinema\\" and leased the property. In 1938 he sold it to a car repair shop, which retained the previous use. In the same year, Oberdorfer and his family managed to flee the Nazis to America. Once there, they did not receive asylum and were sent back to Europe, ending up in the Netherlands. Here they were arrested by the Nazis and deported to Westerbork concentration camp and later to Sobibor, where they were murdered April 30, 1943. The building was preserved in its initial form after the reparation in 1945, and was continued as a classic cinema. It also served as a meeting room for the denazification processes. After the decline as a family movie house it served as a porn cinema until it closed in 1974. From then on, the Velodrom served as a facade for the Regensburg theater after the interior was demolished. The site was sold to a company in 1990, which promoted demolition due to alleged dilapidation. Under cover of darkness, a Regensburg- based architect and a steel-construction technician entered the grounds without authorization and clandestinely took material samples for examination. The results were submitted to the city council, who immediately had the building listed as a historical monument. The building was renovated according to strict monument preservation criteria from 1990 to 1996. In addition, remains of a Roman house were discovered during the excavation work. After installing modern seating, the building will henceforth be used as an event hall. Plate in memory of Simon Oberdorfer, founder of the Velodrom Regensburg In memory of the founder, the place in front of the Velodrom was renamed to Simon-Oberdorfer-Platz, 15 October 2017. Structure and equipment The hall is constructed with steel trusses supporting an open-span roof. Surrounding balconies are supported by fluted columns. The mezzanine is ringed with an oval motif mimicking the curve of a velodrome. The front forms a tripartite facade. The original hall was 25 x 35 m, at the time the largest hall in Regensburg. The artistically designed roof construction corresponded to the latest standard and can be found in a similar simplified design at Cologne Cathedral. The hall was supplemented by utility rooms, cloakrooms, toilets and a boiler room, as well as a small side room to the south of the building. The structure was quite imposing. Koch also put great emphasis on the lighting. Therefore, the room received a modern, changeable lighting system with eight carbon arc lamps. Noteworthy was the sweeping stage, the retractable fountain and the slide on the right side of the gallery. Equipment and modern use There are currently 593 seats in the auditorium, 490 seats in 17 rows as a grandstand in the stalls, 99 seats in the gallery and four wheelchair seats. After being used as an alternative Regensburg venue during the three-year renovation of the theater on Bismarckplatz, it is now used as a venue for particularly large-scale productions, predominantly for musical, ballet and drama.

History and functions The Venetian navy had traditionally been a galley-based force. The first organized tactical formations of sailing ships began being formed in the late 15th century. The position of Capitano delle Navi was established as the commander of the larger sailing ships built by the Venetian government, but he also assumed control‚Äîunder the overall authority of the Captain General of the Sea‚Äîover all sailing ships in the battle fleet, which were mostly merchant vessels, chartered in Venice or abroad (usually Holland) for naval service. During the 17th century sailing ships of the line began to play a more important role and comprised a larger and larger portion of the Venetian battle fleet, particularly during the War of Candia. The increase in numbers necessitated the creation of more squadrons, initially by the appointment of a second Capitano delle Navi or of a Vice Capitano delle Navi, but in 1657 two new positions, the Almirante and the Patron delle Navi were created to command the second and third sailing ship divisions, while the Capitano delle Navi commanded the first division. At the outbreak of the Morean War in 1684 the Republic mobilized 24 sailing ships along with 30 galleys, and during that conflict and the subsequent Seventh Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, the sailing ships played the main role in fleet actions. During the latter two wars when the Venetians sent as many as 36 ships of the line into battle, the senior position of Capitano Straordinario delle Navi was created, who now commanded the first division of 9 ships, while the Capitano delle Navi commanded the second. The post of Capitano delle Navi remained the highest peacetime rank for the commanders of the sailing fleet (armata grossa). Appointment to the post was usually for three years. As distinctive signs, the flagship of the Capitano delle Navi carried a single lantern aft, the standard of Saint Mark on the starboard side aft, and on the mainmast a square ensign of Saint Mark.

Action  The character names Tancr√®de and Am√©na√Øde are taken from Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, but the plot does not owe anything to this work. The action takes place in the year 1005 in Norman-ruled Syracuse at the time Sicily was throwing off the rule of the Saracens. Am√©na√Øde, daughter of Argire, is betrothed to Orbassan. However she loves Tancr√®de, who has gone onto hiding after being placed under Imperial ban at the initiative of Orbassan. A letter from Am√©na√Øde to Tancr√®de is intercepted and falsely said to be intended for the Saracen Solamir; she is then held prisoner until she can be tried. Tancr√®de, thinking he has been deceived by Am√©na√Øde, seeks death in an attack on Solamir, whom he kills.

Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag. Berlin 1994, p.134 Composition In 1759 there was a change in the practices of the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise which Voltaire had long advocated - the removal of rows of spectators from the stage. This meant that for the first time the full width of the stage could be used; a grander spectacle could be presented, with more action in each scene. This change prompted Voltaire to write a drama that would take full advantage of these new performance conditions, creating an elaborate visual spectacle. Together with his emphasis on action rather than intense exploration of character, the play produced a somewhat operatic effect. Voltaire began work on the play in 1759 and claimed to have written it in just four weeks.Manuel Couvreur: Tancr√®de. In: Dictionnaire Voltaire, Hachette Livre, 1994, p.227 Tancr√®de was a departure from some of the other norms of French tragedy established by Racine. Until 1760 all of Voltaire's tragedies had been written in rhyming Alexandrine couplets, the normal form of dramatic poetry in the French theatre of the time. Tancr√®de however was written in 'vers crois√©s' which gave the language a somewhat more natural and less declamatory quality. Voltaire also concentrated on filling the action with pathos, tenderness and chivalric sentiment. When Jean-Fran√ßois Marmontel visited Ferney before the manuscript was sent to the actors in Paris, Voltaire gave him a copy to read. When he returned it Voltaire said to him 'your tears tell me eloquently what I most desired to know.' As well as for its moving action, the play was noted for some particular instances of realism unusual at the time. For example after being arrested Am√©na√Øde appeared on stage in fetters, and Tancr√®de actually threw down a gauntlet when he challenged Orbassan to combat.  Performances and critical reception  After initial rehearsals in Tournai there was a private performance at Voltaire's house theatre in Ferney in October 1759; following alterations the play had its public premiere on 13 September 1760. The premiere in the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise with Lekain in the title role and Claire Clairon as Am√©na√Øde was a success and prompted the creation of two parodies by Antoine-Fran√ßois Riccoboni in the Th√©√¢tre-Italien: La nouvelle joute and Quand parlera-t-elle? However as a result of various intrigues the play was taken off the stage after only thirteen performances.Theodore Besterman: Voltaire. Winkler, M√ºnchen 1971, p.345 As well as enjoying public success, Tancr√®de was also appreciated at court. When a play was required for the celebration of the wedding of the dauphin (the future Louis XVI) and Marie Antoinette in 1770, Tancr√®de was selected and performed. The accession of Louis XVI in 1775 thus offered Voltaire some hope that the court would no longer be so firmly opposed to his return to Paris. While the new king remained implacable however, Marie Antoinette was better disposed towards Voltaire and in 1776 she requested that Lekain perform Tancr√®de at court once again. Denis Diderot attended the premier and wrote to Voltaire afterwards with his critical views. He praised many aspects of the play, notably the third act; he admired the scene where Am√©na√Øde faints when she unexpectedly sees Tancr√®de. He found the mute scene particularly powerful, because the acting alone, he felt, imparted the tragedy more effectively than words could have; it reminded him of Poussin's painting (es) Esther before Ahasuerus. His main criticisms were around the reactions by two characters in the play which did not seem probable to him. The first was in Act 2 when Am√©na√Øde's father Argire appears to have no qualms about agreeing that his daughter is a traitor and readily assenting to her punishment. 'Make him more of a father', he wrote to Voltaire. The other fault he found was in Act 4 where Am√©na√Øde is indignant that Tancr√®de too is so ready to believe her a traitor; in Diderot's view she should have been able to better appreciate how matters appeared to him. √âlie Catherine Fr√©ron also praised the play, welcoming the feelings of chivalry which it inspired and describing it as a new kind of spectacle. Dorothea Celesia produced an adaptation of Tancr√®de in English under the title \\"Almida\\" which was staged at Drury Lane in 1771. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published a German translation in 1802 and Gioacchino Rossini made his great international breakthrough with his opera Tancredi in 1813, inspired by Voltaire's tragedy.  Printed editions  The play was printed by Prault in 1760, together with a dedication by Voltaire to Madame de Pompadour, an admirer of Tasso. This dedication secured the assistance of Madame de Pompadour in ensuring that first minister √âtienne-Fran√ßois de Choiseul allowed the book to be published. Numerous reprints and pirated prints followed immediately. * Tancrede, trag√©die, en vers et en cinq actes; repr√©sent√©e par les Com√©diens francÃúais ordinaires du Roi, le 3 septembre 1760 Prault, petit fils, Paris 1760, with two copperplates by Pierre Fran√ßois Tardieu * Tancrede, trag√©die, en vers crois√©s, et en cinq actes; repr√©sent√©e par les Com√©diens francÃúais ordinaires du Roi, le 3 septembre 1760 Prault, petit fils, Paris 1761, 8¬∞, (12) * Tancred, translated and edited by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

Out of the SR deputies, all but Pokrovsky were Left Socialist- Revolutionaries. The head of the Bolshevik list, Kamenev, had been elected from four different electoral districts, and opted not to represent Pskov. Likewise, Mikhail Lashevich, the second candidate on the Bolshevik list was also elected from the Western Front electoral district, and opted to represent his military constituency.

Miami was founded by Cleve W. Van Dyke in 1907 and is located on the northeastern slope of the Pinal Mountains, between the towns of Superior and Globe on U.S. Routes 60. Brief history 'Bloody Tanks Wash'Virgin Mary Shrine The area surrounding the Pinal Mountains and where the present day town of Miami in Arizona is now located, was inhabited by the Tonto Apache Tribe. Silver mining started the initial move into the Miami region in the late 1860s. The Apaches would sometimes raid the settlements of the Anglo-Europeans and steal their live stock. On January 27, 1864, a group of settlers under the leadership of King S. Woolsey decided to confront the Apaches, with the help of Maricopa Warriors, and retrieve their live stock. They went deep into Apache territory in the Pinal Mountains and soon found themselves surrounded by the hostile Native Americans. Twenty four (24) Apaches and one Anglo were killed in what became known as the \\"Bloody Tanks Massacre\\". The Bloody Tanks Wash was named after the Bloody Tanks Massacre since it was said that the red Apache blood filled stream in the wash. This is the stream that would bisect the future town of Miami.The Battle of Bloody Tanks Revisited The price of Silver prices began to drop while the price of Copper increased. The Miami Copper Company was established and the mining town flourished. Though the town was officially founded in 1907, by Cleve W. Van Dyke, it wasn't until after 1908 that miners, businessmen and entrepreneurs began to take an interest in settling there.The Story of Cleve W. Van Dyke Cleve W. Van Dyke was a local businessman and entrepreneur who purchased land from the Miami Land and Improvement Company. He came up with the idea of celebrating ‚ÄúMiami Townsite Day‚Äù October 11, 1909. With the help and support of real estate companies in Globe, Van Dyke organized several events and was able to create a state of enthusiasm among the public for the townsite day. Thus, he did not have any problems in selling many of his land lots.‚ÜêCopper Mining History of Miami, Arizona Van Dyke is considered to be the founder Of Miami. Eventually, the Phelps Dodge Corporation bought out the Miami Copper Company and took over the day-to-day operations of the mine. Finally the Freeport-McMoRan then bought Phelps Dodge and continues the daily operations of the mine.

History and functions The Venetian navy had traditionally been a galley-based force. The first organized tactical formations of sailing ships‚Äîoriginally merchant vessels chartered for naval service‚Äîbegan being formed in the late 15th century. The position of Capitano delle Navi was established as the commander of the sailing squadron in the battle fleet, under the overall authority of the Captain General of the Sea. During the 17th century sailing ships of the line began to play a more important role and comprised a larger and larger portion of the Venetian battle fleet, particularly during the War of Candia, leading to the creation of divisions of the sailing battle fleet (the armata grossa), and the posts of Almirante and Patron delle Navi established in 1657 to command these. In the Morean War (1684‚Äì1699) and the Seventh Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1714‚Äì1718) the armata grossa already played the main role in combat, and with as many as 36 ships, the senior position of Capitano Straordinario delle Navi was created. He served as commander-in-chief of the sailing fleet and commanded the first division of 9 ships, while the Capitano delle Navi commanded the second, etc. The post of Capitano Straordinario delle Navi was a wartime appointment only. As distinctive signs, his flagship carried a single lantern aft, the standard of Saint Mark on the starboard side aft, and on the mainmast a square ensign of Saint Mark. In peacetime, these were the insignia of the flagship of the Capitano delle Navi. Following the Peace of Passarowitz in 1718, the Venetian navy was reduced in size and limited to its peacetime duties; the only time a Capitano Straordinario delle Navi was appointed again was in 1784, when Angelo Emo was sent to lead a naval expedition against the Beylik of Tunis.

Harvey, born Gerald Harvey Jones, (1933 - November 13, 2017) is an American traditionalist artist whose career has spanned five decades with a wide range of collectors, from Lyndon B. Johnson, to Margaret Thatcher and Texas Governor John Connally. Harvey's paintings and sculptures have been collected and showcased throughout the world, including The White House and the Embassy of the United States, Moscow. Early life Jones was born in 1933 in San Antonio, Texas. He was inspired to draw western scenes from his grandfather's stories of living on the Texas Frontier. Jones graduated from Tivy High School in Kerrville, Texas in 1952. He attended Abilene Christian University, and graduated cum laude from the University of North Texas. in 1956 with a degree in industrial arts. Shortly thereafter, Harvey became the industrial arts teacher at O. Henry Middle School in Austin, Texas. Throughout his teaching career he continued to draw, sculpt and paint. One day, he took some of his works to the Country Store Gallery in Austin, Texas for constructive criticism. Once the dealer tore his pieces apart, he started buying Jones' supplies and would pay him $25 for a painting. Most importantly, he taught Jones how great artists had worked ‚Äì and after a few years of this study, he started painting with his own style. Career Throughout his early years as an artist, Jones served on the staff of the University of Texas at Austin as a supervisor to the Texas Union of Arts and Crafts. During this time he discovered the great painters of light, in particular, Childe Hassam, Jean- Baptiste-Camille Corot and J.M.W. Turner; he also became interested in the works of Luigi Loir, Jean-Bernart Duvivier and Edouard Cort√®s. Soon he began to shift from teaching to working on his art, and eventually he became a full- time artist. In 1957, Jones began selling his paintings under the signature G. Harvey Jones. A year later, he shortened it to G. Harvey. Soon thereafter, in 1965 he entered his first major show, the Grand National Exhibition in New York City and was bestowed the New Masters Award by the American Artists Professional League. Although initially a Texas landscape painter, from 1975 ‚Äì 1985 Jones attempted multiple times to join the Cowboy Artists of America and failed. He began working with the techniques he had learned from studying French boulevard artists Luigi Loir and Eug√®ne Galien-Laloue and their incorporation of illuminating street lights. He began to mix this lighting technique into his own paintings, and was the first American artist to apply them to western art. People began to take notice of Harvey's talent and his work began expanding to other major cities in the U.S. His original paintings have sold in the thousands of dollars, setting a record auction price of $516,500 at Heritage Auctions in November 2018. His limited editions were published by Texas Art Press, and then from 1984 through 2015 they were published by Somerset House Publishing, with assistance from Gregory Editions on the hand-pulled pieces. He also did Western sculptures. His artwork was exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution, the National Archives Building and the Treasury Building in Washington, D.C.. Notable collectors included Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th president of the United States, John Connally, the 39th governor of Texas, and businessman Lloyd Donald Brinkman. Jones was a significant donor to Focus on the Family, and its office in Washington, D.C. includes a gallery of his paintings. He did Christian-themed paintings for the organization, including Of One Spirit, depicting board members Hugo Schoellkopf, George Clark, Dr. Trevor Mabery and Reverend Creath Davis. A book published by Focus on the Family in 2002 suggests, \\"Apart from Dr. Dobson's father, James Dobson Sr., Focus on the Family is probably most closely associated with the Texas painter and sculptor Gerald Harvey Jones, commonly known as G. Harvey.\\" Personal Life Jones married Patty Marie Bentley. They had a son, Gerald Jones Jr., and a daughter, Pamela. Together, they resided in Austin, Texas until they moved into the Weyrich-Arhelger House, a historic house in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1985. Jones died on November 13, 2017, leaving behind his wife, Patty, children, and four grandchildren. He was buried in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

Exchanges of fire lasted for two more days, until a cease fire was achieved with Egyptian mediation. Some minor incidents and protests followed some two weeks after the cease fire, with decreasing intensity. The operation According to Hamas armed wing the al-Qassam Brigades, witness reports, recordings of radio chatter obtained by Israeli news program Hadashot corroborating the story, and the IDFs own report the operation proceeded as follows: = Intrusion into Gaza = On 11 November, Israeli special forces entered Gaza in a blue Volkswagen van through one of the official border crossings, either through Israel's Erez Crossing or Egypt's Rafah Crossing, and the group provided identity documents. Following the crossing, the group passed through two checkpoints; one controlled by the Palestinian Authority and one controlled by Hamas using forged IDs with the names of well-known local Palestinian families. The group were dressed in traditional Palestinian Muslim attire and two of them disguised as women. = Spotting by Nour Baraka and questioning = A local commander named Nour Baraka spotted the van outside his window in Khan Yunis three kilometers into Gazan territory. The van was then stopped at a Hamas checkpoint for questioning. The Israelis claimed that they were NGO workers, part of a medical team ferrying patients in the area and that they had a wheelchair in the back of the van. According to the sources, the questioning lasted for 40 to 45 minutes. Several things didn't seem right to the Palestinians. The accents of the Israelis didn't match the location their identity cards stated that they were from. A woman sat between two men even though their IDs said they were members of different families, something that was frowned upon under local customs. Furthermore, the Israelis told Hamas that they were going to visit a woman who does not live in the area. Senior commanders were summed to the scene and they decided to bring the Israelis into custody for further questioning. At this point, the operative identified as \\"Lt. Col. A\\" opened fire. He shot and killed Baraka and his deputy, Mohammad Majed Al-Qara, with his silenced gun. Here the sources diverge. IDF sources claim that stray bullets from Lt. Col. As gun hit and killed his colleague Mahmoud Kheireddine, in Israeli media identified as \\"Lt. Col. M\\", and wounded another Israeli surrounded by Hamas members. Hamas sources claim that Kheireddine was shot in the head by one of their fighters. The van proceeded to sped away. = Hamas takes up the chase = One Hamas vehicle took up the chase while other units scrambled to set up a roadblock. At that point, the Palestinians believed that they were dealing with a criminal gang or a rival faction. The van opened fire and sped through the roadblock. During the pursuit, Israeli tanks and aircraft opened fire in the area to provide cover for the van's escape. Some time later the operatives stepped out of the van and faced their pursuers in a gunfight killing them all. They pulled their dead comrade's body out of the car and continued the flight on foot towards an olive grove where a Sikorsky CH-53 helicopter from the Israeli Air Force's elite Unit 669 was waiting. After extracting the soldiers, the van was struck by dozens of Israeli rockets and completely destroyed. According to the IDFs report, the evacuation from the time Lt. Col. A killed Baraka to the helicopter landing in Israel took 20 minutes. = Immediate aftermath = Gazan Health Ministry identified the killed as the aforementioned Nour Baraka, Omar Jani Abu Hatar, Mohammad Majed Al-Qara, Ala Adin Koidar, Mustafa Hassan Abu Odeh, Mahmoud Atallah Masabach and Ala Fasifis. The first six listed were Hamas members and the last a member of the Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades, the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees. According to witness reports, three of them were killed by ground-fire and three by airstrikes, one later succumbing to his wounds. The Israeli soldier was identified as \\"Lt. Col. M.\\" Six more militants and one Israeli was wounded in the operation. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) quickly dispelled a rumor about a soldier having been taken prisoner, but did not provide their account of the event other than noting, in response to Hamas allegations claiming otherwise, that it was \\"not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security.\\" IDF chief Gadi Eizenkot said that it was a \\"a very meaningful operation to Israel's security.\\" In a television interview on Sunday night, the former commander of IDFs Southern Command, general Tal Russo, speculated that the raid wasn't an assassination attempt but an intelligence-gathering mission gone wrong. Fawzi Barhoum, spokesperson for Hamas, denounced the \\"cowardly Israeli attack\\". Exchanges of fire The clashes intensified over the next days as Gazan militants fired projectiles into Israel and Israeli airstrikes hit targets in Gaza. 460 projectiles were fired into Israel, of which 100 were intercepted by the Iron Dome and the majority of the projectiles that weren't fell in open areas causing neither casualties nor property damage. The IDF attacked about 160 targets in Gaza, among them several \\"high-quality\\" multi- story buildings, unprecedented since the 2014 Gaza war. These clashes killed eight Palestinians - seven in Gaza and one in Israel. =Sunday 11 November 2018= 12 November 2018 Israeli shelling of Al-Aqsa TV in Gaza In the hours after the operation, 17 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel of which three were shot down, causing sirens to sound in southern Israel and Israeli authorities to change the flight path of aircraft landing at Ben-Gurion Airport as a precautionary measure. In communities near the Gaza border, classes were cancelled for Monday morning and farmers advised not to work in their fields. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut his visit to France short and returned to preside over a Security Cabinet meeting concerning the clashes that would be held on Tuesday. Commenting on the situation, he said that \\"no political solution exists for Gaza, just as there isn't one with ISIS\\", that he is doing what he can to avoid an \\"unnecessary war\\" and also that \\"we were a step away from exerting maximal force and I think Hamas understood this.\\" In a tweet he commended the slain soldiers bravery and wrote that \\"our forces acted courageously.\\" =Monday 12 November 2018 = In the morning, Musa Abu-Marzouq, a senior member of Hamas, said that yesterdays operation \\"exposed the Israeli occupation's hypocritical behavior with the international community\\" and the organisation issued a statement \\"announcing the beginning of bombardment of the enemy's settlements\\" as a \\"response to yesterday's crime.\\" Islamic Jihad that \\"unless Palestinians live in peace, they won't live in peace. Playing with the lives of Palestinians can't be without a price.\\" At least 300 projectiles, of which 60 were intercepted, were fired from Gaza into Israel during the day, wounding nine civilians. In the afternoon in Kfar Aza a Kornet anti-tank missile hit a bus transporting soldiers, critically injuring a 19-year-old Israeli soldier standing nearby. An accompanying video showing the bus being blown up was uploaded on Twitter by the Hamas-affiliated Quds News Network. During the night to Tuesday, a rocket directly hit a residential building in Ashkelon, killing Mahmoud Abu Asba, a Palestinian man from Hebron, and wounding two women. Factions inside Gaza said these attacks were in retaliation for yesterday's Israeli operation. The Israeli Air Force struck more than 70 targets in Gaza. Among them the building hosting Hamas' tv broadcasting station Al-Aqsa which was leveled to the ground, an attack denounced by Barhoum as \\"a barbaric, brazen aggression.\\" Soon after strikes destroyed Al Aqsa radio station and Al Amal Hotel, a building Hamas uses for offices. In addition, a weapons storage facility in Khan Yunis, a military building in Zeitoun and a weapons manufacturing site in Sheikh Omdan were bombarded. The Israeli navy attacked a ship belonging to Hamas at the Nuseirat port in southern Gaza. Three Palestinians were killed by tank fire into Gaza and nine were wounded. Two of those, Muhammad Zakariya al-Tatari and Muhammad Zuhdi Odeh, were members of the PFLP and the third, Hamad Muhammad Musa al-Nahhal, killed east of Rafah, of Islamic Jihad. Saeb Erekat of Hamas rival faction Fatah called for \\"international protection\\" and for the international community \\"to prevent a new massacre in Gaza.\\" Commenting on the violence, Israeli deputy minister Michael Oren said that Israel \\"will do whatever it takes\\" to defend itself and that he \\"expects the world to stand with us.\\" Abu Rukun wrote on the unit's Arabic-language Facebook page a sharply worded warning addressed to the Gazans about \\"terrorist activity\\" that ended with \\"Residents of Gaza, look carefully at the pictures from Operation Protective Edge in 2014 ‚Äì a picture is worth a thousand words\\", alluding to the destruction Israeli bombardment caused in the 2014 Gaza war. According to one activist, the same threat was made in English on COGAT:s Twitter feed, @cogat_israel, but was quickly deleted. Knesset members of the opposition expressed criticism over Netanyahu's Cabinet's handling of the conflict with Hamas. Tzipi Livni of the Zionist Union stated \\"we have a strategic dispute with the government on the ways to attain long-term quiet ... Instead of accepting the situation, we must act, but differently\\", referring to the recently signed deal to allow Qatar to send $15 million in cash to Hamas. Yesh Atid of Yair Lapid suggested that the government should take better care of persons affected by the violence, by compensating parents that needed to stay at home due to school closures and that mental health centers should receive more backing. =Tuesday 13 November 2018= Three Palestinians were killed and three more were wounded by Israeli airstrikes during the day. The victims were identified as Khaled Riyadh al-Sultan, a farmer not part of any militant group, Musaab Hoss and Khalid Akram Youssef Maarouf. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas cut his visit to Kuwait short and called for an urgent meeting among the Palestinian leadership.  Cease-fire  On Tuesday the Israeli Security Cabinet conferred in a seven-hour long meeting, from 9:00 to 16:00, behind closed doors. While the meeting was ongoing, it was reported that Hamas through mediators sought a cease-fire with Israel. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh suggested that \\"if Israel stops the aggression, it will be possible to go back to the cease-fire understandings... the resistance defended its people against Israeli aggression, and the Palestinian people, as usual, continued to the resist with patience and pride.\\" Later that day Palestinian factions in Gaza released a statement announcing that a cease-fire had been reached. Hamas said that it \\"appreciates efforts alongside different entities to obtain a cease- fire and we thank and cherish the Egyptian effort and the international effort, as well as the role the Norwegians and Qataris played.\\" On the Israeli side, the situation was more ambiguous. An unnamed Israeli official's response to queries from the press was that \\"Israel reserves its freedom to operate\\" but confirmed that \\"requests by Hamas to form a cease-fire came from four different mediators. Israel responded that developments on the ground will determine [the Israeli reaction].\\" The four mediating parties named were Egypt, the United Nations, Norway and Switzerland. Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, who had participated in the cabinet meeting, refrained from confirming whether a cease-fire had been reached and instead put the onus on Hamas, claiming that \\"the Israeli military landed a harsh and unprecedented blow on Hamas\\" and that \\"we will see if that will suffice or whether further blows will be required.\\" At least four other members of the cabinet, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, Environmental Protection Minister Ze'ev Elkin, and Education Minister Naftali Bennett said they opposed the cease-fire but that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forced the decision by not allowing the cabinet to vote. Netanyahu, a few days later, dismissed those claims as \\"spin\\" and that the reason why no vote was held was because the cabinet unanimously supported the cease-fire. Members of the opposition sharply criticized the decision to allow the cease-fire. Ofer Shelah of Yesh Atid called Netanyahu a \\"a coward in war and a coward in diplomacy\\" as did Itzik Shmuli of the Zionist Union, calling for \\"landing a terrible blow on Hamas‚Ä¶We are not trigger happy but this [deal] is an accord of weakness that erases Israeli deterrence.\\" But other members of the Knesset welcomed the cease-fire. =Palestinian and Israeli public reactions= Residents of Israeli towns close to the Gaza border met the news of the cease- fire with anger. In Sderot hundreds gathered, blocking roads and burning tires, to express their dissatisfaction, while in Gaza it was met with joy as thousands took to the streets celebrating and waving Hamas' green flags. Meanwhile, peace groups held demonstrations in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, requesting a cease-fire. The Israeli protests against the cease-fire centered around Sderot continued on Wednesday. On Thursday night about 1,000 demonstrators gathered in Tel Aviv, blocking the highway outside the Azrieli Center. = Political ramifications = On Wednesday morning, calling for early elections, Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman resigned from the government, saying that the ceasefire was \\"surrendering to terror\\".Israel Defence Minister Lieberman resigns over Gaza ceasefire, BBC, 14 November 2018Israel's Defense Chief Resigns, Slams Netanyahu for 'Surrendering to Hamas Terror', Haaretz, 14 November 2018 The resignation was welcomed by Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri who said it \\"showed a state of weakness that has overcome the Israelis.\\" Political commentators thought that the resignation would trigger an early election in Israel which are scheduled to be held in November 2019. With Lieberman leaving the government and taking his party's five Knesset members with him, Netanyahu's coalition was left with a thin majority of only 61 out of 120 members. To make matters worse, Bennett requested that he'd be given the defense portfolio, a request that was supported by other high-ranking members of his party who said they would otherwise decide to leave the government. Instead, Netanyahu himself took on Lieberman's defense portfolio and rejected calls to hold early elections as \\"irresponsible\\" and Bennett backed down from his demand. The decision to stay in the government was slammed by Lieberman who said that Bennett and Shaked were \\"stuck to their seats at any cost.\\" Incidents after the cease-fire=Wednesday 14 November 2018= A Palestinian man was shot and arrested as he was throwing grenades at the security fence in northern Gaza, according to Israeli military sources. Later in the day, also in northern Gaza, Nuaf Ahmad al-Attar, a 23-year-old fisherman was killed by the Israeli navy. Local sources said he was working on the beach when he was shot in the stomach. Israeli military sources said he was approaching the security fence. =Thursday 15 November 2018= Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi was lambasted for statements he made in an interview with Israeli Army Radio: \\"Hamas responded [to the botched IDF mission] in a measured manner and attacked only the Gaza border area. There's a difference between the border area and Tel Aviv, the economic capital of Israel. Hamas's attack was minor, because (rocket) fire at Tel Aviv has different ramifications.\\" Netanyahu immediately distanced himself from the comments and Hanegbi apologized for them. =Friday 16 November 2018= For the 34th Friday straight, nearly 10,000 Palestinians gathered in the afternoon for the weekly March of Return demonstrations near the Gaza fence which often leads to clashes with the Israeli side and Palestinian casualties. In the protests, one Palestinian was killed and over 40 more wounded by live fire from Israeli soldiers near the refugee camps Bureij and Rafah. The day prior to the demonstrations, Kamil Abu Rukun, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), had posted an Arabic language video on his Facebook page, warning the Palestinians that Israel's \\"patience has run out\\" and that the military would show \\"zero restraint.\\" Organizers of the protests had urged the people to demonstrate \\"to thank the resistance\\" but also to stay away from the fence. =Saturday 17 November 2018= According to Palestinian sources, a farmer was shot in the leg by Israeli forces as he was working his land in the eastern part of the Maghazi refugee camp in Gaza. In northern Gaza, bulldozers entered into Deir al-Balah and leveled land. =Monday 19 November 2018= On Monday, Palestinians staged for the 16th time this year a maritime protest using 20 boats while demonstrators gathered on the beach near Beit Lahia in northern Gaza. Israeli forces responded with shooting tear gas and live fire at the protesters. 25 people were wounded, among them an Associated Press cameraman who were shot in his left ankle. According to witness reports, he was standing 600 meters from the security fence and was wearing a protective vest with the word \\"PRESS\\" written on it. =Thursday 22 November 2018= On Thursday, the Israeli Security Agency Shin Bet announced that it had uncovered a Hamas- connected cell in the West Bank which was planning to launch an attack in Israel. According to Shin Bet, the plan was to carry out the attack as soon as possible. =Friday 23 November 2018= For the 35th consecutive Friday, Palestinians protested near the fence demarcating the Gaza-Israeli border. 14 were wounded by Israeli fire in demonstrations that was characterized as quieter than usual. International response Condemnations from international parties were mixed, some blamed Hamas for the clashes, others Israel and yet others both sides. Jason Greenblatt, US President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East put the blame for the recent spur of violence on Hamas, \\"Gaza terrorists are once again attacking Israel with rockets and mortars. ... Israel must once again use military force to protect its citizens. We stand with Israel in its defense against these attacks. ... This violence is preventing true assistance to the people of Gaza.\\" As did Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz who on Tuesday condemned the rocket attacks from Gaza and called for violence to stop immediately. Czech Republic President Milos Zeman said that Israel reserves the right to an \\"aggressive response\\" to the bombardment of its citizens and France's foreign ministry condemned the barrage rockets fired by Hamas \\"in the strongest terms\\". Ibrahim Kalin, spokesperson to the Turkish president said \\"These attacks have once again shown Israel‚Äôs unlawful, tyrannical, and occupying stance.\\" Syria slammed Israeli actions.Syria strongly condemns Israeli aggression on Gaza, affirms standing by Palestinian people Other parties urged restraint on both sides. On Monday, the UN Mideast envoy Nickolay Mladenov tweeted that the \\"#UN is working closely with #Egypt and all concerned to ensure that #Gaza steps back from the brink. The escalation in the past 24hrs is EXTREMELY dangerous and reckless.\\" EU ambassador to Israel Emanuele Giaufret urged everyone to \\"step back from the brink.\\" On Tuesday Kuwait, Bolivia and Abbas requested an urgent meeting with the UN Security Council to discuss Gaza. The request was granted and the Security Council announced that it would convene later that day. Danny Danon, Israel's envoy to the UN, cautioned that Israel would \\"not accept a call for 'both sides to act with restraint.'\\" The council, however, failed to agree on any action. Investigation Both Hamas and media conducted investigations to try and understand the purpose of the botched Israeli operation, what its purpose was and how the IDF had infiltrated Gaza. On 28 November Hamas claimed to have identified over 80% of the Israeli force's moves. =Purpose of the operation= Hamas claimed that the wreckage of the car contained a listening device, and that the purpose of the mission was to replace similar spy equipment on Hamas' private communications network uncovered earlier that year in May. According to the group, the IDF had previously installed listening devices near the border, under the cover of works done by one of the Palestinian telecommunications companies. Reportedly, they had successfully removed those devices. =Photos of the \\"fugitives\\"= On 22 November, the al-Qassam brigades released photos on social media of the eight operatives they said were involved in the Gaza raid, urging the public to contact them with information about the whereabouts of the \\"fugitives\\" and their collaborators. Pictures of two vehicles, a Volkswagen van and a Mercedes truck, were also published. According to Hamas the truck could still be operating inside Gaza. The photos were reportedly acquired by Hamas when the special forces entered Gaza through the Erez crossing using fake IDs of real Gaza residents with the photos swapped. The residents whose IDs the Israeli special forces had forged were detained but later released when it was found out that they didn't know that their IDs had been used by the Israelis. The Israeli Military Censor in a rare public statement in response, urged Israelis not to spread the information as it could help Hamas \\"decipher and understand\\" the operation. Israeli media, which almost always complies with instructions from the censor, therefore could only publish pixelated or blurred photos pre- approved by the censor. But in international media the photos were published verbatim. To further contain the spread of the photos, Israel blocked the websites of Hamas' military wing. According to the Palestinian-friendly blog The Electronic Intifada, Twitter forced several accounts who had tweeted the photos of the Israeli commandos to delete their tweets. = Information about the operatives = According to the Hamas, the Israeli operatives were part of the Sayeret Matkal unit, established in 1957 to collect intelligence behind enemy lines. =Palestinian collaborators= According to Hamas, the Israeli forces were helped by Palestinian collaborators. The collaborators both provided the Israelis with two cars and helped them install listening devices. Supposedly, to catch collaborators Hamas setup roadblocks and conducted random searches in the week following the operation. On 3 December, the military court in Gaza announced that it had sentenced six convicted Palestinian collaborators to death and seven more to life in prison. In January 2019, Hamas announced that it had arrested a further 45 alleged spies and collaborators linked to the botched raid. =Military base in Gaza= Investigations by Hamas found that the unit involved in the covert operation was part of a longer, broad operation inside Gaza, masquerading as members of the German humanitarian organization Humedica which provides humanitarian and medical aid for Palestinians in Gaza. These forces were operating from a house and yard that they had rented from an unknowing Palestinian police officer. This way, they gained access to sensitive locations such as rocket launching sites, tunnel entrances and senior Hamas members homes. =IDF investigation= In the first half of 2019, the IDF conducted its own investigation of the botched raid in Gaza. The investigation revealed that the officer killed in the raid, still only identified as Lt. Col. M, was killed by friendly fire. According to the investigation, the operatives were equipped with false documents which were found to be suspicious by the Hamas militias. After having been interrogated for 45 minutes a commander of the operative group, identified only as Lt. Col. A shot and killed one of the interrogators, ostensibly Nour Baraka. The report lauded Lt. Col. A for his actions, despite also identifying him as the one who shot and killed Kheireddine He was also considered for a medal of honor. Overall, the report deemed the raid to have been a failure. =Al Jazeera documentary= In December 2019, Al Jazeera's news program Ma Khafia Aazam sent a one-hour documentary in Arabic about the botched Israeli raid and the subsequent flareup in violence. Economic and social impact The rocket attacks from Gaza had some effect on businesses and restaurants in southern Israel. The finance minister announced compensation to businesses for losses and the Israel Tax Authority to parents that missed work because they had to stay at home with their children due to the school closure that the Home Front Command had imposed. On 21 November, the Tax Authority announced that these regulations would be finalized in the coming days and provide compensation to tourism operators, business owners, parents who missed work and beekeepers for losses suffered due to Gaza clashes from May 2018 to the end of the year. On the Gazan side, the financial losses incurred by the destruction of the Al Aqsa building was estimated to $2 million. In total, nine buildings were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes, six of them high-rises, causing an unknown amount of financial damage and displacing 100 families.  Criticism of IDF's media handling  In the hours following the botched operation in Gaza, the IDF, in contrast to Hamas, kept relatively silent about the details of it. This brought on the ire of some Israeli journalists who felt that the IDFs media handling was old-fashioned. On Monday, Israel Radio's Gal Berger tweeted that \\"the Israeli media ran with the Hamas version of events. And isn‚Äôt to blame for that\\" and that the IDF waited too long with countering the Gazan narrative \\"In 2018, they don‚Äôt have the luxury of waiting 10 hours before countering the claims being spread by the other side, and here as well.\\" In an apparent jab at the Israeli Military Censor, Ramallah-based journalist Marian Houk tweeted that \\"It's 2018 -- and when you censor something, you're supposed to know that you can't censor; you lose control of the story and information. The details get out anyway (sometimes with extra disinformation)...\\" Another point of contention was that the Israeli military censor prohibited the press from publishing details about the slain soldier. He was only identified by his rank and first initial, \\"Lt. Col. M.\\" But on social media, pictures of him and his family had already begun to spread. Israeli MKs Shelly Yachimovich and Ksenia Svetlova published details identifying the soldier on their Facebook pages, defying the censor's orders. Judah Ari Gross of The Times of Israel, hours after the botched operation, tweeted \\"I know the officer's identity but cannot publish the information as it is subject to a military censor (because Israel still has one in 2018).\\" Nachman Shai, journalist and MK of the Zionist Union, claimed that \\"the social media networks defeated the military censor\\" further urging the IDF to adapt to the new media landscape. Details of the operation remain under a strict gag order by the Israeli military censor and all articles the Israeli media writes about it must be pre-approved.

Early History In 1972, Donald Court, who would later become president of the British Paediatric Association and Tony Jackson produced a booklet, that was called Paediatrics in the Seventies that for the first time advanced the idea that perinatal paediatrics would be sub- speciality of Medicine, and progress was slow to recognise it as such. BAPM as an idea started in 1974, when the paediatrician Peter M. Dunn wrote a leader for The Lancet called The price of perinatal neglect. In the 1970s the care of newborn infants was considered dire, and only after their registration by their parents, when they were six weeks old, did they become NHS patients. Combined with many others problems like paediatricians who were single handed, underfunded and distributed across large areas of the population, with the result that perinatal mortality in the UK was five times higher than it need have been and that as many newborn infants died in the first three days of life as in the whole of the remainder of childhood. When The Lancet article was published, it aroused the interest of the government, and the Department of Health contacted the British Paediatric Association to investigate the matter. In 1975 June Lloyd acting for the government, wrote to Dunn to ask him for help in finding all the paediatricians who were specifically working, i.e. caring for newborn babies in the UK After Dunn wrote to all the medical universities and maternity hospitals in the United Kingdom, to all paediatricians who were spending more than 60% of their time with newborn children and collected 20 people in total, he decided to try and advance an idea to provide help, where ever he could. Dunn first approached the British Paediatric Association and consulted the president Donald Court who encouraged Dunn to organise the small group. Dunn also spoke with Roy Meadow who advised Dunn on problems he would face to establishing the association, including accusations of empire building from certain paediatricians who would be excluded from his group, including senior paediatricians who provided leadership in neonatal medicine and were prominent members of the Neonatal Society. When Dunn approached the Neonatal Society, they declined to help. Dunn sent a letter to the 20 people he had identified and invited them to a meeting at the BPA in York, that was to be held to initiate BAPM as a pressure group. At the time Roy Meadow posted a notice seeking members who were interested in the care of the newborn with the hospital and university in York. Unfortunately, there was no significant progress during the abortive meeting, as Dunn was looking for those of were actually facing the problems of providing a neonatal intensive care service. As there were none there, the meeting closed. Dunn then decided to write to all the 20 people requesting a second time that they attend a Neonatal Symposium in Bristol in 1976. This meeting occurred, and the British Paediatric Perinatal Group, the forerunner to BAPM was formed as a pressure group. Dunn's initial idea for the association was that it would work as a twin group, alongside obstetrics, i.e. the twin being a new British Obstetric Perinatal Group. However, this never happened. Dunn approached several colleagues who were specialists in obstetrics, who were initially enthused by the idea, but was subsequently dissuaded by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The common view of obstetrics at the time was that all gynaecologists were already perinatologists. On top of this, the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology did not agree to the BPA being affiliated to their college. Recognition Dunn commenced the process of gaining formal recognition of the subject of perinatal paediatrics, and enable formal examinations to be held for physicians seeking to gain a speciality in perinatal paediatrics, i.e. a training programme from the Royal Colleges and the British Paediatric Association (BPA). In 1977, Dunn approached the BPA to begin this process of formal recognition of the perinatal paediatrics group. In conversation with the BPA, they replied that neonatology was likely to remain in the domain of general paediatrician's and therefore perinatal or neonatal paediatrics would not be recognised as a sub-speciality. For much of the 1980s, neither the BPA nor the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists felt that a country- wide, coordinated service for specialist neonatology and high risk obstetrics were of much use. Indeed, for much of the decade, the differentiation in obstetric and neonatal care units for those offering complex care and those offering care at the local level, had made little progress within the UK. By the end of the 1980s, with many therapeutic treatments being introduced, there was a slow dawning of recognition that there was a place for specialist neonatology and neonatal centres, although the majority of neonatal care was still being delivered by general paediatricians who worked outside specialist centres, treating both paediatric and neonatal patients, and it was unlikely the situation would have changed without many new doctors coming into the profession, as the decade passed. First quarter century In 1981, Dunn created an executive committee and a chairman position was announced, to better address working practices, often meeting in his house in Bristol. In 1982, Peter Tizard gave the first annual Founders' Lecture, who in his lecture pointed out that it should be an appointed president, not a chairman. At that time, Dunn also registered the group as a charity, and changed the name from perinatal group to British Association of Perinatal Paediatrics. Dunn became the first president and Harold Gamsu the honorary secretary. In 1982, the chairman of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists working party, Charlie Whitfield suggested that the group should be called the British Association of Perinatal Medicine. This was finally accomplished by Dunn in 1987. A training programme was created in 1982 for those looking for a career in perinatal paediatrics by the British Paediatric Association and Royal College of Physicians.Joint Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Higher Medical Training. Guidelines on training for perinatal paediatrics. Royal College of Physicians, London. 1982. p. 44‚Äì45 This process took six years and was helped by Donald Court who published the report called Fit for the Future in 1976, that recognised the high mortality rate of perinatal mortality,Committee on Child Health Services Fit for the future London: HMSO, 1976. (Cmnd 6684, vols I and II) and by the Short Report published in 1979-1980, that highlighted the neglect of perinatal medicine in the country.House of Commons Social Services Committee Session 1979‚Äì80 Second report: perinatal and neonatal mortality London: HMSO, 1980 One of the most important advanced for BAPM was the publication of the report, called the K√∂rner report in 1984. led by the National Health Service (NHS) Reformer Edith K√∂rner. The most important recommendations from BAPM's perspective from the report, was that in future all infants should be recognised at birth as a patient, as well as defining a data set for the baby as well as the mother, in part to move the NHS into the digital age. Dunn Perinatal Library On 18 January 2012, the association opened a library with books that were provided from Peter Dunn's own personal collection. The libraries aims are to support the learning and information needs of the BAPM's members, students, and staff.

Early life  Freydis Leaf was born in Cambridge to Catherine (Shuttleworth) and Charles Leaf. She was the middle child of three: two boys and a girl. Her father was a meteorologist and archaeologist who served in both the Great War, as an Army officer,https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28941/supplement/8331/data.pdf and the Second World War, as an officer of the Royal Marines; he was, in the meantime, also an Olympic gold-medallist. She was educated at Ancaster Gate school, Bexhill, East Sussex, then Wycombe Abbey school, Buckinghamshire.  War-service  When her father and brother Derek started to learn to fly in 1937, Freydis insisted on the same opportunity: they all learned to fly at the Marshall flying school in Cambridge. When the war began, Leaf volunteered as a nurse in the Red Cross in Colchester, Essex while trying to get into the ATA for over a year. She went on to work with the Aeronautical Inspection Directorate. In 1943 she joined the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) and began her career as a pilot. Starting with 26 hours and 10 minutes flying time, she was based in Hamble, Hampshire. She also served in the Ferry Pools (FP) in Sherburn-in-Elmet in Yorkshire, Prestwick in Scotland and White Waltham, in Berkshire. As an ATA pilot, Leaf learned to fly a wide range of planes from the Vickers Wellington and the Lockheed Hudson to the De Havilland Mosquito and Spitfire. By the end of the war she had 607 hours and 25 minutes flying time accumulated. Her distinguished brother, Lt. Derek Leaf, DSC & bar, RNVR, and BA.(Cantab.), was killed in action in 1944.https://www.cwgc.org/find-war- dead/casualty/2696018/leaf,-edward-derek-walter/  Post-war  The ATA was disbanded at the end of 1945 and Leaf then worked as a freelance commercial pilot, gaining her commercial licence in November 1946. In 1953, as a commercial pilot, Leaf flew a Hawker Tempest V on a 4,000-mile flight from the base in England to a base in Karachi. When she arrived, after stops in Nicosia, Baghdad and Bahrain she was not allowed to use the Officers mess because she was a woman. In 1949 she was commissioned into the Women's RAF Volunteer Reserve (WRAFVR), as a Pilot Officer; she later earned a promotion to Flying Officer. During her 5-year commission, she also became one of the first women to qualify as an RAF pilot. In 1954 Leaf became the British Air- Racing Champion and, in the following year, she founded the British Women Pilots' Association. She was also a leading figure in the Women's Junior Air Corps and the Girls Venture Corps.  Personal life  On the Edinburgh Castle liner to South Africa with her mother to visit her brother, Leaf met Tim Sharland, a former British Army officer. They married shortly after, on New Year's Eve and worked both in Africa and Britain. They had three children, two daughters and a son. Freydis Sharland stopped flying for several years while her children were young but took it up again when her youngest was 17. After she retired from training young women pilots with the Girl's Venture Corps she began flying microlights until the end of the 20th century. She died 24 May 2014. First five Jean Bird, Benedetta Willis, Jackie Moggridge, Freydis Leaf and Joan Hughes were the first five women to qualify as pilots of the RAF. All qualified in the early 1950s, as officers of WRAFVR, and were awarded the standard 'Wings' of an RAF pilot. There was a gap of nearly four decades until the next woman, Julie Ann Gibson, a regular officer of the WRAF, qualified in 1991..

It concerns a group of characters reacting to the disappearance of a Sinophile American man who gave away his money to charity. According to Jennifer Lee of The Asian American Literary Review, the novel \\"is never really about Gordie‚Äôs disappearance, but about the problem of knowledge and authority in this world of global interconnection.\\" Plot A different character or group of characters is the third person narrative focus on each section of the book, or an act. There are a total of five acts, with an intermission located between the third and fourth acts. The novel's action starts with the disappearance of Gordon \\"Gordie\\" Ashberry, a wealthy bachelor. Minnie Chang (Zhang Lianhe) writes a book about Gordon after Gordon decides to donate his remaining money.  See page at Asian Review of Books  Note the Asian Review of Books page has some quotations not present in the SCMP re-posting. He disappears on a stopover at Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, while traveling from New York City to Hong Kong. Gordon began using a new passport with a new name, left behind his coat, passport, and wallet, and flew to Detroit. His self-imposed exile resulted in friends Harold Haight and Larry Woo and other characters to look for him. After Gordon disappears, his godson Peter goes to Hong Kong to look for Gordon while starting a study program as a cover. A subsequent chapter focuses on Minnie Chang. Characters Jenn Lee Smith of Hyphen Magazine stated that \\"The main characters all seem to be highly accomplished, wealthy and/or privileged in some way\\", and all admire Gordon and bear \\"personal motivations for remembering and fawning over him\\". According to Jennifer Lee, the characters are \\"in transit between cultures and languages, sometimes resisting and sometimes embracing the legacies of their parents, their countries, their personal histories.\\" * Gordon \\"Gordie\\" Ashberry. Gordon, the titular character, lived in Connecticut as a child, and was born to an American who was one of the Flying Tigers in World War II and his wealthy wife. Gordon had no siblings, grew up with a butler from England, had never married in his life, and had lived off of family money. Larry Woo states that Gordon is \\"Sino-American, which is not the same as being Chinese-American, which is what Larry is, or not, depending on your perspective.\\" He also has a Chinese name, Hui Guo (), meaning \\"grey fruit,\\" given to him by Larry. His other names include \\"Bugs Bunny,\\" \\"G,\\" \\"Gordon Haight Ashberry,\\" and \\"Gordon Marc Ashberry\\", and he uses the name \\"Marshall Hayden\\" when disappearing. ** Jennifer Lee describes Gordon as \\"an absent central protagonist\\" who \\"represents a certain fantasy of place which globalism has not alleviated, only complicated\\". Jenn Lee Smith stated that sometimes there were too many Looney Tunes references around the character. * Larry Woo - Jenn Lee Smith stated that he had an especially close relationship with Gordon. He had received a PhD in American studies, is in a romantic relationship with a writer, and is known as his family's \\"weird child\\". He befriended Gordon as a young man on a commercial flight, where he gave Gordon his Chinese name. * Zhang Lianhe, a.k.a. Minnie Chang and Lulabelle - A writer, she is described by Rosie Milne of the Asian Review of Books as \\"predatory\\", and by Jenn Lee Smith as \\"a shameless opportunist\\". The book Honey Money, which is published in the United States, in English, is described by Jennifer Lee as a \\"pop culture, gossipy book\\". Minnie had copied content from an essay written by a high schooler for that book. According to Jenn Smith, the reader learns her rationale and truly understands the character after reading a subsequent chapter told in another character's point of view. Lee describes Minnie's other book, written in Chinese, as \\"a serious examination of her alienation.\\" ** Jenn Lee Smith stated that Minnie was to show how first impressions could be misleading or totally incorrect, and that she was \\"far more believable [compared to many of the other characters] and one of the more interesting characters in the novel.\\" * Peter Height - Gordon's godson, he is 28 years old. ** Jenn Lee Smith criticizes dialog from Peter that she believes is unrealistic for a man of his stated age. * Stella - advises a government on China-United States relations. She supports the People's Republic of China even though her family had supported the historic political party of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang. She was once the fianc√©e of Gordon. * X-woman - a Chinese American who originates from Hong Kong, lives in New York and writes books for a living, \\"X-woman\\" is Gordie's name for her, and she last sees him in a bar in a Hong Kong hotel. Milne states she is a \\"presumed avatar\\" of the author. The novel does not give details about their relationship. Reception Milne wrote that That Man in Our Lives is \\"an ambitious, witty and generous novel, which also has enough mystery to keep even somebody with 20th-century tastes turning the pages.\\" Publishers Weekly stated that the \\"engrossing, whirlwind metafictional tale effectively demonstrates the far-reaching effects of politics and culture on the smallest, most personal aspects of our lives.\\" ReferencesExternal links * That Man in Our Lives by C&R; Press 2016 novels Books about China ","title":"That Man in Our Lives"},{"id":"59028594","text":"The Ministry Of Social Affairs And Labour is a government ministry in Kuwait.

It is owned by France's national state-owned railway company SNCF and served by TER Provence-Alpes-C√¥te-d'Azur regional trains. According to the SNCF, 424,347 passengers travelled through the station in 2018. History The train station was the stopping point of some Marseille trains linking Paris to the C√¥te d'Azur (the Paris-C√¥te d'Azur and the Blue Train in particular), which avoided the creep in Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles by borrowing the connection of the Carthusians (service restored at the end of 2015). The existence of a tram line (line 68) linking the Blancarde station in the heart of the city by the Chave boulevard and the tunnel under the Plain facilitated its use. The removal of this has considerably diminished the importance of this station. From 2009, the station was the subject of improvement works in the redevelopment of the line between Blancarde and Aubagne. Signaling work is being done around the station to modernize the infrastructure on the route leading to Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles.

Company headquarters are located in Hod Hasharon, Israel. The company operates subsidiaries in Dalton, Israel, India, New York and Hong Kong. In 2017, Sarin India, the Indian subsidiary, opened ‚ÄúSarin House‚Äù in Surat, consolidating the company's Surat-based activities in one facility. The company is publicly traded on the Singapore stock exchange (SGX) and was the first Israeli company to be listed there. In 2018, Sarine opened the Sarine Technology Lab at the Israel Diamond Exchange, and later that year opened a lab in Mumbai, India. The Sarine labs are the first diamond laboratories in the world to use diamond grading technologies based on artificial intelligence. History Sarin Technologies was established in 1988. On January 21, 2014, the name was officially changed to Sarine Technologies. The company's first product was the Robogem, an automated device for gemstone processing, as part of an initiative promoted by the Israel Emerald Cutters Association. In the early 1990s, the company released DiaMension¬Æ, one of the world's first diamond cut grading software that could accurately measure a rough diamond's measurements within seconds. This transformed the way the industry approached the process of diamond cutting and fueled consumer demand for a wider range of cuts.https://www.ft.com/content/bc4de9bc-ed21-11df-8cc9-00144feab49a In the mid-1990s, the company released the DiaExpert¬Æ hardware and Advisor¬Æ software for automated rough diamond planning via 3D diamond scanning. In 2005, the company released the first green laser diamond sawing machine, called Quazer¬Æ, based on proprietary technology purchased from CNC Laser, a Belgian company. New versions of the Quazer¬Æ were released in 2010 and 2014. In 2012, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group, part of the Chow Tai Fook conglomerate in Hong Kong, implemented Sarin's Solaris¬Æ 100 and DiaExpert¬Æ Eye systems for inclusion mapping and rough planning at their diamond manufacturing facilities in China and South Africa. In 2014, Sarine launched Sarine Loupe‚Ñ¢, a diamond imaging device that enables 360-degree viewing of diamonds. In the same year, RapNet¬Æ announced that it was incorporating Sarine Loupe imagery on its diamond trading platform. In November, a Sarine Loupe‚Ñ¢ service center was opened in the Diamond District of New York. In 2014, Sarine signed a cooperation agreement with Tiffany & Co. to develop an automated system for the grading of symmetry of polished diamonds based on grading standards set by Tiffany. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) adopted Sarine Instructor¬Æ as its standard software for diamond grading and analysis in 2015, updating from the DiaVision software by Sarine that it had been using in its labs since 2010. In 2016, the company acquired Diamining, a developer of point-of-sale apps for the diamond and jewelry industry, for $1.2 million. The Diamining technology was used as the basis for the development of Sarine Connect‚Ñ¢, a diamond inventory search and display app for traders and retailers. In February 2017, Sarine and GTTL Laboratories of Switzerland signed a collaboration agreement to research new approaches to diamond grading and authentication, as well as other industry challenges. In 2017, three Indian nationals were arrested on suspicion of attempting to execute a ‚Äé‚Äé‚Äé‚Äé$1 million bribe in exchange for the intellectual property of Sarine's diamond planning software. That same year, the company filed a lawsuit in India against a diamond manufacturer in Surat. Citing fraud and breach of contract, Sarine accused the manufacturer of allegedly hacking and manipulating the Sarine Galaxy¬Æ technology, and under- reporting the weight of diamonds scanned in the system. In August 2018, Sarine entered into an agreement with Lucara Diamond Corp to provide Advisor¬Æ rough planning and Galaxy¬Æ inclusion mapping technologies for the Clara rough diamond trading platform, developed by Lucara. Notable products & technological services =Sarine Galaxy= In 2008, Sarin Technologies purchased Galatea Ltd, an Israeli company that developed scanning and mapping technology for the detection of inclusions in rough diamonds, at a cost of $10.77 million. Following the development of the prototype to commercial application, Sarine released the Galaxy¬Æ in 2009, the world's first fully automated inclusion mapping device for rough diamonds. In early 2018, the company announced that Galaxy¬Æ systems scanned over 10 million rough stones worldwide during 2017, out of a total 30 million stones scanned by the technology since it first launched in 2009. In 2018, the first Galaxy¬Æ service center in China was opened, in the Sha Wan Jewellery Park in Guangzhou. =Sarine Light= In 2011, the company launched the Sarine Light‚Ñ¢ light performance grading device. The technology that forms the basis of the Sarine Light‚Ñ¢ was purchased by Sarine Technologies in 2010. The first version of the Sarine Light‚Ñ¢ was known as Sarin D-Light. The first Sarine Light‚Ñ¢ system was sold to diamond manufacturer EXELCO in 2013. =Sarine Profile= In early 2015, Sarine announced the launch of the Sarine Profile‚Ñ¢ platform that provides a digital visual story of the diamond, with the aim of increasing efficiency in the diamond trade and retail sector. In 2017, the Sarine Profile‚Ñ¢ platform was expanded to include 4Cs grading based on new color and clarity technologies developed by the company. In August 2018, the first Sarine Profile‚Ñ¢ service center was opened in Japan. =Sarine Color and Sarine Clarity= In 2016, Sarine announced that it was developing new devices for automated grading of diamond color and clarity. Known as Sarine Clarity‚Ñ¢ and Sarine Color‚Ñ¢, the devices are based on machine learning, and are regarded as creating the first standardized and automated approach to diamond grading and gem labs. =Diamond Journey= In February 2018, Sarine announced the launch of the Diamond Journey‚Ñ¢, a digital platform that displays information about a polished diamond throughout the manufacturing process from rough status to polished state. The Canadian mining company Dominion Diamond Mines was the first company to adopt the Diamond Journey for its CanadaMark diamond brand. =Sarine Advisor= Many diamond manufacturers use Sarine Advisor software for mapping, planning and scanning of rough/polish diamond.https://sarine.com/products/sarine-advisor/ The software take input from different diamond scanning machines of Sarine.

He is the Hilldale and Gregory Breit Distinguished Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Director of its Institute for Elementary Particle Physics. Halzen is the Principal Investigator of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica, the world's largest neutrino detector which has been operational since 2010.  Background  Halzen was born and raised in Belgium. He graduated from the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) with a MSc Physics degree in 1966, a PhD in 1969, then his Agr√©g√© de l'Enseignement Sup√©rieur in 1972. Between 1969-1971 he worked as a scientific associate at CERN. Since 1972 he has been a professor at the University of Wisconsin- Madison and the Principal Investigator on the AMANDA and IceCube projects. Halzen is been a leading scientist in the development of cosmic ray physics and astroparticle physics since the 1970s. In addition to particle physics he published many early papers on cosmic ray anomalies and quark matter, and on relations between particle physics and cosmic rays, on particles from supernovae and on muon production in atmospheric gamma-ray showers. He has served on various advisory committees, including those for the SNO, Telescope Array and Auger-upgrade experiments, the Max Planck Institutes in Heidelberg and Munich, the ICRR at the University of Tokyo, the US Particle Physics Prioritization Panel and the ApPEC particle astrophysics advisory panel in Europe. With Alan Martin he is the co-author of Quarks and Leptons, a standard text.  AMANDA  Halzen first learned about attempts by Russian scientists to detect neutrinos in Antarctica, using radio antennas at their Antarctic research station to search for electric sparks resulting from cosmic neutrinos colliding with the ice. After determining these interactions would be too weak to register, in 1987 he started working on the AMANDA project, which proposed burying an array of light sensors deep in the Antarctic ice which is clear, dark, stable, sterile and free of background light. This pilot experiment proved successful, however their results were marred by interference from cosmic rays as well as air bubbles in the ice. This convinced him that a much larger and deeper array would be needed, and in 2005 the AMANDA project became part of its successor project, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.  IceCube  Halzen argued for a much larger detector, and was able to secure funding from both European and American sources. In 2005 his team started construction of the IceCube project, designed to be 100 times bigger than AMANDA, with a total size of 1 km3 and buried up to a mile and a half deep. After six years of construction, IceCube became operational in 2010. The most important result from the IceCube was the clear break-through observation of high-energy neutrinos (about 100 times more energetic than the particles accelerated today in the world‚Äôs most powerful machine, the LHC at CERN) in 2013, from as yet not identified sources outside the Galaxy. This discovery has stimulated the planning and development of even larger neutrino telescopes, both at the South Pole and deep under the ocean.

Agnes Nininger Saunders Kemp (November 4, 1823 ‚Äì 1908) was a 19th-century American physician who was a national leader in the temperance movement as well as the first woman to practice medicine in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Family and education She was born Agnes Ninninger in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Antoine 'Anthony' Ninninger (1787‚Äì1866), from Alsace, France, who had emigrated to America in 1816, and Catharine (May) Ninninger (1800‚Äì1833), who was of Pennsylvania Dutch (Swiss-German) descent. Her mother died when Agnes was nine. She first married William Saunders, an army colonel, but was widowed after a few years. In 1857 she married Joseph Kemp (d. 1875) of Hollidaysburg; they had one surviving daughter, Marie Antoinette, who became a professor of German at Swarthmore College. Career Early in her first marriage, she had health issues that resulted in a trip to New York state for treatment, where she met and was inspired by the social reformers Lucretia Mott, William Lloyd Garrison, Abby Kelly Foster, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. On her return to Harrisburg, she began to advocate for temperance reform and was instrumental in establishing a chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. She also advocated for prison reform and public education for children, among other issues. By her mid-forties she was recognized nationally as a reform leader, and Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and Lucretia Mott were among the influential speakers who came to Harrisburg at her invitation. Kemp was convinced that ignorance of hygiene was at the root of many women's illnesses and determined to study medicine. She entered the Woman's Medical College in Philadelphia, and when she graduated in 1879 she was, at 56, the oldest member of her class. She set up practice in Harrisburg, becoming the first woman in Dauphin County to practice medicine as well as the first (in 1880) to be invited into the county medical society. She continued to advocate for temperance reform both in the United States and during several extended visits to France. She retired in 1903 and went to live with her daughter, who died in 1907. Kemp then helped to raise her grandson until she died the following year. She is buried in Harrisburg Cemetery. ReferencesFurther reading *Eyster, Nellie Blessing. A Noted Mother and Daughter.

Rage rooms may consist of fake living rooms and kitchens with replicas of furnishings and objects such as televisions and desks. The company may allow clients to bring their own possessions to destroy. The first rage rooms to open were likely in Japan in 2008 or earlier. The concept spread to other countries, such as Serbia, England, and Argentina. Today, there are hundreds of rage rooms in cities in the United States such as Denver, Huntsville, Tucson, Austin, Milwaukee, Buffalo, Charleston, Rochester, Hampton, Eugene, Charlotte, Ogden and American Fork.

He then worked as a schoolteacher and played amateur football with Grays Athletic before moving to Northfleet United along with Charlie Buchan in 1909. There, he was part of the team that won the Kent League, the Thames & Medway Combination, and the Kent Senior Cup in 1909‚Äì10. He scored over 50 goals in all competitions that season, including the opening goal of the Kent Senior Cup Final, against Chatham, leading the South Eastern Gazette to describe him as \\"probably the Cementers' best catch of the season\\". He also guested for Southend United. In 1910, he joined West Ham United of the Southern League Division One. He scored on his debut, against Brighton & Hove Albion on 5 November 1910, and averaged a goal every other game during his two seasons at Upton Park. In January 1912, he switched to inside left, where he played his final three games for the club instead of his usual centre forward role. He was forced to retire from professional football after injuring his knee in an FA Cup third-round match against Middlesbrough on 8 February 1912. After the outbreak of World War I, Kennedy enlisted with the London Scottish Regiment due to his parentage, and served as a Lance Corporal. He saw action at Loos as part of an offensive on the Hohenzollern Redoubt and was killed in action in France on 13 October 1915. He and two others were killed by shellfire during a patrol.

She was better known as Preta Fernanda (literally: Black Fernanda) and Fernanda do Vale (her nom de plume). She was, perhaps, the best known black citizen of the city in that period. Nascimento was born to poor parents in a small village near Ribeira da Barca on the island of Santiago in Cape Verde, probably in 1859. Cape Verde, a volcanic archipelago off the west coast of Africa, was a Portuguese colony and a nexus for the Atlantic slave trade. Although slavery was abolished in Portugal nearly a century earlier, it was only selectively abolished in Cape Verde in 1857 with complete abolition in 1878. It is possible, therefore, that one or both of Nascimento's parents were enslaved when she was born or had been enslaved. When she was about 19, she sailed away from the small Atlantic island in the company of a ship's captain, Jer√≥nimo Martins, who promised her marriage, but abandoned her once they arrived in Dakar, on the African coast. She subsequently married a German beer maker, Frederick \\"Fritz\\" Kemps, who took her to Lisbon, and with whom she had twins. According to some sources her husband died; others say he was habitually drunk and abandoned her. A woman, modeled on Andr√™sa do Nascimento, points at the Marquis of S√° da Bandeira; Dom Lu√≠s Square, Lisbon Regardless, Nascimento found herself alone again, and in order to support herself and her children, she worked briefly as a model for Italian sculptor Giovanni Ciniselli. She is immortalized in Dom Lu√≠s Square in Lisbon as a figure supporting the sculpture of the Marquis of S√° da Bandeira, famed for his abolitionist efforts. Nascimento posed for Ciniselli's depiction of an enslaved African woman, broken chains on her ankles and a child in her lap. The woman faces her child while pointing at the figure of the Marquis above them, as if extolling the nobleman. The sculpture was funded by a public subscription and was unveiled by King Lu√≠s I in 1884. She found steadier work in 1889 as a lady's maid for a high society woman, a member of the influential Cavalcanti family. She stayed in this position for nearly two decades. After eighteen years, she left the lady's service and, using her savings and her society contacts, opened a brothel in Lisbon's Bairro Alto neighborhood, which she quickly established as a nightly meeting place for writers, politicians and bohemians of the Portuguese capital. Nascimento became one of the most famous courtesans in Lisbon; she had many lovers, from sailors and soldiers to influential writers and legal scholars, and was a regular figure at the hottest night-spots. Glamorous and unafraid of scandal, Nascimento, it is claimed, once fought a bull on horseback in Alg√©s, and she accompanied famed author Jos√© Maria de E√ßa de Queir√≥s to his box at the Teatro da Trinidade. She was also, reportedly, the only woman who remained in the room when futurist Almada Negreiros presented his‚Äîat the time‚Äîshocking Ultimatum Futurista in April 1917. Nascimento dressed as a bull-fighter on the cover of the first edition of Recorda√ß√µes d'uma Colonial In 1912 Nascimento published an autobiography, Recorda√ß√µes d'uma Colonial (Recollections of a Colonial Subject), written with help from two friends. The memoir tells the story of her life in Cape Verde and Portugal, but the authors sometimes forsook accuracy in favor of a more exciting story. She diligently recorded all of the men who had shared her bed (but not their true names), and in the final chapter offered candid commentary on each man's sexual performance. A modern reader notes that, in today's context, the language of the book is racist and reflects stereotypes of its time. Little is known of her life after 1912. Nascimento died in Lisbon on 20 August 1927.

The state produces 80% of the world's almonds and 100% of the United States‚Äô commercial supply. Economic impact Almonds were California's third most valuable agricultural product in 2016, accounting for $5.2 billion (about 11%) of agricultural output. Almond production has increased significantly in recent years; by weight, production more than tripled from 703 million pounds in 2000 to 2.27 billion pounds in 2017. Prices rose over the same period, fueled in part by overseas demand. Newly planted almond acreage has displaced more traditional cash crops, such as cotton. Almonds being harvested with a tree shaker In addition to consumer demand, the industry's growth has benefitted from mechanization. During the harvesting process, tree shakers are used to aggressively shake each almond tree, causing the nuts to fall to the ground. This reduces the need for labor relative to other crops, which has attracted farmers who are concerned with shortages of migrant workers. A 2014 report commissioned by the Almond Board of California, an industry group, found that the industry directly employed 21,000 people and indirectly supported an additional 83,000 jobs statewide. Including indirect effects, the industry added about $11 billion to the state's GSP. =Exports= Almonds are California's most valuable export crop. Farmers exported $4.5 billion worth to foreign countries in 2016, about 22% of the state's total agricultural exports. The majority of these exports went to the European Union, China and India. While the EU is the largest consumer, the latter two countries are expanding markets where the state's Almond Board has actively marketed the nuts as a healthy snack. As part of the 2018 China‚ÄìUnited States trade war, China has imposed a 50% tariff on almonds. As a result, some Chinese businesses have resorted to importing almonds from other producers in Africa and Australia. Environmental issues=Bees= Beekeepers in a California almond orchard Like many crops, almond cultivation requires cross-pollination. Although almonds can be pollinated by many insects, commercial almond farming is heavily dependent on honey bees. Commercial almond growers may rent hives during the blooming season to ensure pollination success. Starting in 2006, California almond growers began to suffer losses due to colony collapse disorder, a poorly understood phenomenon resulting in the decline of bee populations. While this increased pollination expenses for many growers, high demand for almonds created an incentive to transport bees from across the United States to California. The state's bee population has since partly recovered, and in 2018 accounted for more than half of all bee colonies in the United States. =Water= California drought status, July 19, 2016 California suffered a severe drought from 2011 to 2017. In addition to economic consequences for the state's almond growers, the industry came under criticism for its water use. As of 2015, almond cultivation consumed about 10% of the state's water. Furthermore, almond acreage increased by 14% from 2007 to 2014, while almond irrigation increased by 27%. Critics have pointed out that the state's 6,000 almond farmers use roughly 35 times the amount of water as the 466,000 residents of Sacramento. To supplement reduced deliveries from the state's water system, many almond farmers increased groundwater pumping, which can unsustainably deplete aquifers and cause land subsidence. Almond production fell somewhat a result of the drought, contributing to higher prices and dampening consumer demand. To compensate, many farmers removed older, less-productive almond trees and replaced them with newer plantings that use less water. Since these trees will take half a decade to become productive, some farmers have expressed concerns about a future almond surplus. =Waste products= In the 2015/2016 crop year, the California almond industry produced over 1.5 million metric tons of hulls and over 0.5 million metric tons of shells. Historically, these byproducts have been used for livestock feed and bedding, or as fuel for cogeneration plants. However, declining demand for these uses combined with an increasing supply of almonds has created a mismatch. The state Almond Board has researched ways to incorporate almond byproducts into other industries such as food, automotive, and pharmaceutical. One possible use investigated by the Board is bioenergy feedstock. For example, biochar made from almond shells can be integrated into automobile and plane tires, allowing them to better resist changing temperatures. Biochar can also be used to make stronger, biodegradable plastic goods such as garbage bags and flower pots. A similar sustainability initiative has been \\"whole orchard recycling\\". At the end of their productive life, whole almond trees are ground up and the remains are integrated back into the soil, which retains the tree's nutrients. This process also increases the soil's ability to hold water.

Between 2002 and 2007, Turkey's economy experienced an average growth rate of 7.2%, much higher than the average growth rate during the nineties. The Turkish economy saw relative prosperity for the duration of the Global financial crisis of 2008 and continued to see growth rates of 8.8% in 2010, and 9.2% and 2011. Turkey saw a decrease in unemployment rates, an increase in education rates, and higher life expectancy throughout the country. Turkey's continued economic growth throughout the 2000s was due to multiple factors, including a string of reforms inaugurated by then-Minister of Economic Affairs, Kemal Dervi≈ü.  Recovery and progression after the 2001 economic crisis = The launch of new economic programs = In the spring of 2001, the Turkish government launched a number of macroeconomic policies under the new economic program. These new medium-term policies led to recovery within the country and the later rise of real GDP in the second quarter of 2002. The most significant contributor to the rise in real GDP was the recovery of domestic demand due to the resurgence of the investment sector. = New government structure and work with the International Monetary Fund = The Turkish government changed significantly after the 2002 Turkish General elections, when the new AKP political party was elected, removing the DSP and MHP parties who had political power in the 1990s. Following this election, the political landscape of Turkey became much less varied, as the AKP had a majority of the power. This new government partnered with the International Monetary Fund, an organization made up of 189 countries whose goals include promoting low unemployment, economic stability, financial security, and increasing international trade. In 2002, the International Monetary Fund agreed to lend Turkey roughly $16 billion over the following three years in an attempt to lower governmental debts by creating a surplus in budget revenues. The Turkish government went on to implement a number of public reforms, with the most significant being the adoption of a public sector primary surplus 6.5% of the nation's GNP target for 2003 onward.  Indications of long term growth after 2004 = Increase in private investments, labor productivity, and continued growth = Despite the rapid changes seen following the 2001 financial crisis, there were strong indications of subsequent long-term growth post-2004. There was a double-digit increase in private investment in 2002 and 2003. Although this growth occurred in 2002 and 2003, private investment can be a sign of long term growth to follow within a country. Along with the increase in private investments in Turkey, the country also saw an increase in labor productivity within the labor markets. The increases in private investments and the productivity of workers were two relevant factors that likely contributed to the long term economic growth in Turkey in 2004 and beyond. = Increased number of exports = During this time in 2002 and 2003, Turkey also saw an improvement in external financing. With the improvement in external financing came positive portfolio flows combined with the funds provided by the International Monetary Fund, an overall increase in investments and an increase in gross foreign reserves occurred within the country. The external finance adjustments and improvements that were made, combined with the increase in labor productivity, domestic production within Turkey rose significantly. In the early 2000s, the Turkish Lira experienced significant depreciation, and along with the improvement in external competitiveness and finance, Turkey saw a rise in their total exports. In total, the number of products and goods and services exported from Turkey, in terms of volume, rose roughly 7% in both 2002 and 2003. This increase in exports plausibly played a role in Turkey's growth through the 2000s and it also served as an indicator for future growth to follow post-2004.  Results of macroeconomic stabilization  The economic growth that Turkey experienced was unlikely, was it not for the macroeconomic stabilization that the country implemented between 2002 and 2007. From 2001 to 2007, Turkey was able to reduce its public sector borrowing from roughly 12% of GDP to almost 0% by 2007. Additionally, Turkey achieved a central budget surplus of around 3% between 2002 and 2007, which enabled the country to have a near-balanced central budget beginning in 2006. The macroeconomic stabilization also saw support from the monetary side of the country. The central bank decided to make price stability in the country a priority and succeeded as the annual inflation rate declined from 54.2% in 2001 to around 8.8% in 2007. This monetary success was another piece of the economic stabilization that Turkey achieved from 2002 until 2007. Subsequent crisis Turkey experienced a renewed currency and debt crisis beginning in 2018.

Family and education She was born Edith Mitchill in South Orange, New Jersey, and was the daughter of a well-to-do businessman. Starting in 1883, she studied art at the Art Students League, where George de Forest Brush and William Merritt Chase were among her teachers. In 1887, she enrolled in the first life drawing class open to women, a rare privilege at a time when women art students were ordinarily excluded from drawing the nude model. In 1889, she was one of the founding members of the Woman's Art Club of New York. That same year, she went to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie Julien for a year and a half; among her teachers were William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Gustave Courtois. She exhibited at the Paris Salon. Art career Edith Mitchill Prellwitz, Early Morning Stroll, oil on canvas, 1900. On her return to the United States, she set up her studio in the Holbein Studios building on West 55th Street in Manhattan. In 1894, she married the artist Henry Prellwitz, who had a studio across the hall, after he promised to promote her career as much as his own. They had a son, Edwin. In 1899, Edith and Henry began spending time on the north shore of Peconic Bay on Long Island, where their artist friends Irving Ramsay Wiles and Edward August Bell were already established. They moved there permanently in 1914. They painted plein air paintings and also worked in adjoining studios at High House, their Peconic Bay home. Prellwitz painted Peconic Bay landscapes and waterscapes, as well as still lifes, domestic interiors, and figure paintings. Her style ranged from Impressionism and Tonalism to a romantic strain of academic realism. She exhibited mainly in the eastern United States as well as at various expositions such as the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, where she won a medal. Some of her figure paintings featured literary or mythical subjects, and she won prizes for several works in this vein. In 1894 the National Academy of Design (NAD) awarded her the Second Hallgarten Prize for her painting Hagar, and the following year she won the NAD's Norman W. Dodge Prize for her Tannh√§user Legend. In 1929 she won the NAD's Julia A. Shaw Memorial Prize for The Convalescent. Her work has been compared, in quality and subject matter, to that of Mary Cassatt, John Singer Sargent, and her teacher William Merritt Chase. Both Prellwitzes disappeared into obscurity for several decades after their deaths in the early 1940s. Rediscovered in the 1980s, they have been called one of the best-kept secrets in American art history. Prellwitz's work is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum, the Parrish Art Museum, and other institutions. ReferencesFurther reading * Pisano, Ronald G.

History The curvi-linear shoe-shaped field boundary around today's West Irishborough Farm suggest a 9th-11th century Saxon land enclosure, pre-dating the grid-like field boundaries around it.Humphreys, 2.3 Such estates usually had a farm settlement or hamlet on the periphery, which is the site of Tower Farm on the east (West Irishborough in the centre being a 19th c. development). 1888 Ordnance Survey map The estate of Ernsborough clearly pre-dates the Norman Conquest of 1066, as is suggested by the name which is of West-Saxon origin signifying \\"Eagle's hill,Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p.483 mound or burial mound (barrow)\\"Huxtable-Selly, Susan, Ernsborough: Notes on Origins, Cobbaton, Swimbridge, 2005 (Earnes Beorh/Beorg), or \\"Eagle's fortified place\\" (-burh/burg).Huxtable-Selly The West Saxons reached Devon in the 8th century, but the name may be even earlier, if deemed a translation of a Celtic name. The boundary of the Saxon estate is still recognisable today in the form of a curvi-linear hedgebank, and contains or abuts three historic settlements: on the eastern side \\"Tower Farm\\", so named after 1845On the 1845 tithe map it was called \\"Irishborough\\" (Humphreys, Fig.5) and probably the original location of the mansion house of Ernsborough; \\"East Irishborough\\", to the immediate south- west of Tower Farm, shown on the Ordnance Survey map of 1888 but since demolished,Humphreys, Fig.7 and to the west in the centre of the enclosure, the farm of \\"West Irishborough\\". Such a three-settlement arrangement is common with many ancient Devonshire estates.For example Upper, Middle and Lower Cobbaton, also in Swimbridge (Humphreys ) Ernsborough is not recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086; the estate first appears in surviving records in the Pipe Rolls of 1175.Humphreys, 2.1, quoting \\"Gover, J., Mawer, A., & Stenton, F., Place Names of Devon, English Place-Name Society, Vol.8, Cambridge, 1931, p.351\\" Until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, the Bishop of Exeter was the lord of the manor of Bishop's Tawton, a large manor which included the parishes of Swimbridge and Landkey. The bishop was a major landholder who was seated at the Bishop's Palace in Exeter. Thus in the absence of a manor house with a great hall in which the lord's steward could transact manorial business, a court house would have been required. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the lord of the manor of Bishop's Tawton was the Earl of Bedford, later Duke of Bedford, also non-resident. In 1773 the mansion house was a ruin, with only a tower remaining.Humphreys, 2.1, quoting Lysons: \\"A correspondent of Mr Chapple's speaks of a tower remaining in 1773\\" Much quarrying work and lime burning was carried out on the estate in the 19th century and prior, which has left major traces on the landscape. An unusually shaped lime-kiln survives,Humphreys, Fig.11 with several flooded quarries. Descent=de Ernsborough= The earliest history of Ernsborough is given by Tristram Risdon (died 1640), who stated that the first recorded holder of Ernsborough was Baldwin de Ernsborough, living at the start of the reign of King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272).Risdon, p.323 The de Ernsborough family held the estate for a further three generations, when it passed to the Flavell family. =Faluel= The Faluel family, a Norman family often cited as \\"Flavelle\\" because the \\"l\\" and \\"a\\" were reversed in handwritten documents (modern spelling is Fallwell), held Ernsborough after the de Ernsboroughs. They eventually died out without a male heir. The last in the male line obtained the wardshipHumphreys, 2.1, with typing error: \\"When his female descendant married John Mules, John was a minor in the guardianship of his (sic) father Roger\\" (should read \\"her\\") and marriage of the young Roger Mules (described by Risdon as \\"sir Roger Mules, second son to the Lord Mules, Baron of North- Cadbury in Somersetshire\\") and married him off to his own daughter and heiress, as was his right. Thus Ernesborough descended into the Mules family. =Mules= Moels /Mules: Argent, two bars gules in chief three torteaux, ceiling boss of St Bridget's Chapel (North Chancel Chapel), Swimbridge Church, built by the third John Mules (fl.1428) of Ernsborough Origin of Mules The identity of Sir Roger Mules \\"second son to the Lord Mules\\" and husband of the heiress of Ernsborough, is uncertain. The first certain ancestor of the 1st Baron Moels was his grandfather Nicholas de Moels (c. 1195 ‚Äì 1264/72) of North Cadbury in Somerset, of unknown parentage,The Complete Peerage, vol IX. p.1 a household knight and royal administrator of King Henry III,Described in 1229 as miles noster familiaris (\\"our familial knight\\"), The Complete Peerage, vol IX., p.2, Moels who apart from having received a few royal grants of land in his own right, in 1230 married Hawise de Newmarch the wealthy co-heiress of the feudal barony of North Cadbury, which transformed him into a major landholder and feudal baron. In 1230 he was granted by King Henry III the Devonshire manors of King's Carswell and Diptford.Henry Summerson, 'Moels, Sir Nicholas de (d. 1268/9)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004 His second but eldest surviving son by Hawise was Roger de Moels (c.1233/7 ‚Äì 1294) (father of the 1st Baron), who in 1268 received a grant of a weekly market and annual fair at his manor of King's CarswellThe Complete Peerage, vol IX., p.4 In 1293 he was appointed Keeper of the Forest of Braydon in Wiltshire.The Complete Peerage, vol IX., p.5, quoting Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1292‚Äì1301, p.42\\" Roger Moels of Lustleigh (d.1323) Strapwork escutcheon showing arms of de Moels impaling Prouse (Sable, three lions rampant argentVivian, p.626; Pole, p.497; here repainted incorrectly as or), detail from monument to Sir John Chichester (died 1569), of Raleigh, Pilton, about 4 miles north-west of Ernsborough, descended from the daughter and heiress of the marriageVivian, pp.172-3 represented here between Roger Moels (died 1323) of Lustleigh and Alice Prouse (1286‚Äì1335) It is believedThe Complete Peerage, vol IX., p.5, note (c) that the second son of Roger de Moels (c.1233/7-1294), feudal baron of North Cadbury (and thus a brother of the 1st Baron) was a certain SirRisdon, p.133 Roger de Moels (d.1323) of Lustleigh in Devon, called a \\"King's Yeoman\\" in 1301, who married Alice le Prouz (1286‚Äì1335), daughter and heiress of Sir William le Prouz (or Prouse) of Gidleigh Castle,Vivian, p.626, pedigree of \\"Prouse of Chagford\\" Chagford and of Lustleigh, by his wife Alice de Reyny (said by Vivian (1895) to have been Alice Widworthy, daughter and heiress of Sir Hugh Widworthy, who remarried to Sir John Damerell.Vivian, p.626 The Prouz family was the heir of the Widworthys of Lustleigh, according to Risdon). Roger de Moels (died 1323) of Lustleigh is known to have had a son William de Moels (fl.1318), possibly by an earlier wife. Nicholas de Moels, 2nd Baron Moels (died 1316) certainly had a Devonshire connection as he married Margaret Courtenay (died 1349) a daughter of Sir Hugh de Courtenay (died 1292), feudal baron of Okehampton and father of Hugh de Courtenay, 1st/9th Earl of Devon (died 1340), but died without issue. Descent of Mules The descent from Roger Mules and his wife the Flavell heiress was as follows: *John Mules,Humphreys, quoting: \\"R.J.M.\\", Devon Notes & Queries, 1952/3, pp.47-8 *John Mules (son), who may have been the John Mules who in 1373 married Joan de Adeston, a daughter and co-heiress of Gilbert de Adeston of Adeston in the parish of Holbeton, Devon, and widow of John Prideaux, 2nd son of Sir John Prideaux of Orcharton,Vivian, p.618, pedigree of Prideaux Modbury, Devon. =John Mules (fl.1428)= John Mules (fl.1428), (son of the second John Mules), who, being childless, according to \\"R.J.M.\\" (1952) in 1428 transferred Ernsborough to his brother Thomas Mules. It was apparently this John Mules who is recorded in the Heraldic Visitations of DevonVivian, p.16, pedigree of Arscott as having married twice: *Firstly to a certain Elizabeth, by whom he had two daughters and co-heiresses: **Isabell Mules, eldest daughter, who married John Dabernon (alias D'Abernon, etc.) of Dunsland in the parish of Bradford, Devon, son and heir of John Daubernon, Warden of the Stannary and of the Fees of the duchy of Cornwall, a Member of Parliament for Devon in 1356 or 1357,Risdon, p.251 by his wife Thomasine Cade (or Cadiho, heiress of Dunsland. In his will dated 1422 John D'Abernon requested to be buried in the \\"newly built aisle\\",Pevsner, p.771 of Swimbridge Church, a reference to the surviving St Bridget's Chapel, built by his father-in-law the third John Mules (see below). By Isabell Mules he had two daughters and co-heiresses: ***Elizabeth Dabernon, eldest daughter, who married John Battyn, son and heir of John Battyn of Exeter in Devon. The ultimate heiress of this marriage was Phillipa Battyn, wife of John Arscott (1494‚Äì1563) of Arscott in the parish of Holsworthy, Devon, who founded the prominent line of Arscott of Dunsland. ***Joan Dabernon, 2nd daughter, who married John Giffard of HalsburyVivian, p.397, pedigree of Giffard of Halsbury in the parish of Parkham, Devon, ancestor of Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury (1823‚Äì1921) Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. **Alicia Mules, younger daughter, who married Otes Gilbert (1417‚Äì1492) of Compton Castle,Vivian, p.405, pedigree of Gilbert in the parish of Marldon, Devon, whose effigy survives in Marldon ChurchPevsner, p.562 *Secondly, in 1422,Vivian, p.16, regnal date 1 H VI the third John Mules (fl.1428) married a certain Johanna, who survived him and married secondly to Sir John Norby.Vivian, p.16: Johanna, uxor 2, 1 H VI, Johannes Norby miles, 2 maritus (\\"Johanna, 2nd wife, 1422, Sir John Norby, 2nd husband\\") Humphreys (2003) mentions an unreferenced not suggesting that in about 1500 a certain Sir John Norbury lived at Ernscombe.Humphreys, 2.1 Thus, as summarised by Humphreys (2003) (relying on Lysons (1822)Lysons, Daniel & Lysons, Samuel, Magna Britannia, Vol.6, Devonshire, London, 1822 ): \\"A female descendant brought it to the family of D'Abernon and a further female brought it to Gifford\\". Later descendants Monument to John Mules (died 1633) of Halmeston in the parish of Bishop's Tawton A monument to John Mules (died 1633) of Halmeston in the parish of Bishop's Tawton (next to Swimbridge on the south) survives in Bishop's Tawton Church. This mentions the descent of the Mules family of Ernsborough as follows: :\\"... John Mulys of Halmeston, Esq., lineally descended from that worthy family of his name Barons of North Cadbury in Somerset whence a branch transplanted to Ernisborough in Swimbridye continewed on the descente to him who here lay down to rest the 12th September 1633\\". Risdon wrote as follows:Risdon, p.322 :\\"Halmeston, in this tything\\" [Bishops-Tawton] \\"was the land of Fulk in King Edward III's time, by whose co- heir Alice, Baldwin Ackland was invested therewith, which descended to Joan her heir, married to Thomas Mules, second son of Thomas Mules of Ernesborough in King Henry V's time;\\" [1413‚Äì1422] \\"and so lineally after six descents to John Mules the late lord thereof, who married the daughter of Chafe; his father the heir of Yeomans of Northamptonshire. His only daughter and heir Anne was married to Bennet.\\" =Cowell= The Cowell family later occupied Ersborough, whether as tenants or freeholders is unknown. At Ernesborough was born the jurist John Cowell (1554‚Äì1611), Master of Trinity Hall Cambridge, and author of \\"The Interpreter\\", the well-known dictionary of legal terms. =18th century= In 1773 the mansion house was a ruin, with only a tower remaining. In 1902 \\"Irishborough manor house\\" was the property of Rev. Henry Tubal Hole, Rector of Plympton St. Maurice. The site is today covered by the central settlement of \\"West Irishborough\\", which in the 18th century had the status of bartonHumphreys, 2.49.4 or principal farm, and to the east on the edge of the historic curvi-linear estate, \\"Tower Farm\\", believed to have been the site of the mansion houseHumphreys, 2.49.3 of the Mules family. =19th century= On the 1845 Tithe Apportionment \\"Tower Farm\\" is listed as being partly owned by Earl Fortescue, of nearby Castle Hill, Filleigh, and partly by John Nott of Bydown House, Swimbridge, whose family had been yeomen farmers in Swimbridge for many centuries but had recently acquired much wealth having married a wealthy heiress.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 15th Edition, ed.

Early life Samuel Wolfe Sokolow was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City in 1969. His father Mel Sokolow (1933‚Äì1992) and his mother Diane were both producers on various film and television programs in the 1970s. His older sister, Betsy, is a publicist and producer. His older brother, Alec Sokolow, is an Oscar-nominated screenwriter. He spent a significant portion of his childhood socializing with his parents‚Äô actor and producer friends. He credits these early years with his decision to be a producer. Sokolow attended Boston University largely because that was the only school he could find that allowed him to begin a hands-on film curriculum as a freshman. He graduated with a Communications degree in 1991. Though he bounced around between various jobs, even working as a journalist and crime reporter for a time, Sokolow eventually decided to enter the entertainment industry full-time in 1997. Career Sokolow started working on commercials as a producer at different ad agencies before moving onto feature film work. In the late ‚Äò90s, he and Rob Lobl partnered to create SokoLobl Entertainment. The two wrote, produced, and directed an independent film called The Definite Maybe (later retitled No Money Down). They self-distributed the film over the internet. At the time, this practice was unheard of. As a result, Sokolow and Lobl were credited as poster boys of online film distribution in the independent film scene, with Sokolow saying \\"I don't need Hollywood anymore to have 35 million people take a look.\\" Shortly thereafter, Sokolow moved to Los Angeles to focus more on television production. During this period, he produced unscripted TV series for MTV and Oxygen. In 2010, Sokolow and Jeffrey Cooney, the son of EUE/Screen Gems CEO George Cooney, co-founded EUE/Sokolow. This new subsidiary focuses on independent television production by attaching talent to projects before pitching them to larger studios. Their first major project was producing an adaptation of Walter Isaacson's biography of Albert Einstein, Einstein: His Life and Universe. Sokolow and Cooney pitched the project to Ron Howard. Coincidentally, Howard had been looking to make an Einstein project for years. With Howard's backing, EUE/Sokolow teamed with Imagine Entertainment to create National Geographic's first scripted series, Genius, with Geoffrey Rush in the role of Einstein. The series was a critical success, earning 10 Emmy nominations, including a nomination for Outstanding Limited Series. Though the original intent was to create a limited series based only on Einstein's life, the success of the project caused National Geographic to commission the series as an ongoing anthology with a different subject each season. Season 2 followed Pablo Picasso, played by Antonio Banderas, and earned 8 Emmy nominations. Season 3 will center on Aretha Franklin. Besides Genius, Sokolow is currently working on a number of TV and film projects and producing a film written by his brother centered on the legacy of Chuck Taylor and Converse. On January 30, 2019, Sokolow officially launched Nice Media Studios, the successor to EUE/Sokolow, with partners Ron Thomson and Chris Cooney. Sokolow serves as the company's chairman. This new, fully independent studio aims to create premium television productions for domestic and international markets. Their first project is expected in late 2019. Personal life Sokolow married actress and author Julia Fowler in 2003. They currently reside in Venice, California. Sokolow's older brother Alec Sokolow is an Oscar-nominated screenwriter known for Toy Story.

Describing his first meeting with TDE, Reason said: When discussing his different experiences with label meetings, Reason said \\"Every meeting, all they talked about was my social media, my YouTube numbers, my SoundCloud numbers, and then we would play music for six minutes and that would be it, Top did not bring those things up once, and we played music for an hour and a half, and we see where TDE is.\\" Singles and promotion On August 8, it was announced that he was signed to TDE. That same day, he released a promotional single titled \\"The Soul\\", with a music video released the next week. On August 29, he released the first single titled \\"Better Dayz\\", a song that had already made an appearance on his first mixtape.

More often than not he raps with the urgency of a man trying to keep his head above water and given the content of the music he creates it makes sense. Not only is his music about surviving the struggle, but it's simultaneously easy on the ear, which isn't always an easy feat to accomplish.

In typical video manipulation, the facial structure, body movements, and voice of the subject are replicated in order to create a fabricated recording of the subject. The applications of these methods range from educational videos to videos aimed at (mass) manipulation and propaganda, a straightforward extension of the long-standing possibilities of photo manipulation. This form of computer-generated misinformation has contributed to fake news, and there have been instances when this technology was used during political campaigns. Other uses are less sinister; entertainment purposes and harmless pranks provide users with movie-quality artistic possibilities. The proof-of-principle software Face2Face was developed at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, and Stanford University. Such advanced video manipulation must be ranked alongside and beyond previous examples of deepfakes. History The concept of manipulating video can be traced back as far as the 1950s, when the 2 inch Quadruplex tape used in videotape recorders would be manually cut and spliced. After being coated with ferrofluid, the two ends of tape that were to be joined were painted with a mixture of iron filings and carbon tetrachloride, a toxic and carcinogenic compound to make the tracks in the tape visible when viewed through a microscope so that they could be aligned in a splicer designed for this task As the video cassette recorder developed in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the ability to record over an existing magnetic tape became possible. This led to the concept of overlaying specific parts of film to give the illusion of one consistently recorded video, which is the first identifiable instance of video manipulation. In 1985, Quantel released The Harry, the first all-digital video editing and effects compositing system. It recorded and applied effects to a maximum of 80 seconds of 8-bit uncompressed digital video. A few years later, in 1991, Adobe released its first version of Premiere for the Mac, a program that has since become an industry standard for editing and is now commonly used for video manipulation. In 1999, Apple released Final Cut Pro, which competed with Adobe Premiere and was used in the production major films such as The Rules of Attraction and No Country for Old Men. Face detection became a major research subject in the early 2000s that has continued to be studied in the present. In 2017, an amateur coder named ‚ÄúDeepFakes‚Äù was altering pornography videos by digitally substituting the faces of celebrities for those in the original videos. The word deepfake has become a generic noun for the use of algorithms and facial-mapping technology to manipulate videos. On the consumer side, popular video manipulation programs FaceApp and Faceswap, developed from similar technology, have become increasingly sophisticated. Types of video manipulation Computer applications are becoming more advanced in terms of being able to generate fake audio and video content that look real. A video published by researchers depicts how video and audio manipulation works using facial recognition. Though video manipulation could be thought of as piecing together different video clips, the types of video manipulation extend further than that. For example, an actor can sit in front of a camera moving his face. The computer then generates the same facial movement in real time on an existing video of Barack Obama. When the actor shakes his head, Obama also shakes his head, and the same happens when the actor speaks. Not only does this create fake content, but it masks the content as even more authentic than other types of fake news, as video and audio were once the most reliable types of media for many people. One of the most dangerous parts of video manipulation include the concept of politics; campaign videos are being manipulated to pose a threat to other nations. Dartmouth University computer science professor Hany Farid commented on video manipulation and its dangers. Farid said that actors could generate videos of Trump claiming to launch nuclear weapons. These fabricated videos could be shared on social media before the mistake can be fixed, possibly resulting in war. Despite the presence of manipulated video and audio, research teams are working to combat the issue. Prof. Christian Theobalt, a member of a team working on the technology at the Max-Planck- Institute for informatics in Germany, states that researchers have created forensic methods to detect fakes. Video manipulation and fake news With fake news becoming increasingly prominent in popular culture and with rapid advancements of audio and video manipulation technology, the public is increasingly encountering fake news that is supported by deceptive videos. In terms of types of fake news, the potential to be classified is ever-expanding, but include five main types ‚Äî satire or parody, selective reporting, sloppy journalism, clickbait, and conspiracies. Though the five main types of fake news are prominent globally, one of the most destructive types of fake news lies within all five types and is video and audio manipulation. Video and audio manipulation are defined as a new variant of media manipulation which targets digital video using a combination of traditional video processing and video editing techniques with auxiliary methods from artificial intelligence like face recognition. The results range from artistic videos produced for aesthetic effects to videos aimed at (mass) manipulation and propaganda, a straightforward extension of the long-standing possibilities of photo manipulation. Digital Fakes A digital fake refers to a digital video, photo, or audio file that has been altered or manipulated by digital application software. Deepfake videos fall within the category of a digital fake media, but a video may be digitally altered without being considered a deepfake. The alterations can be done for entertainment purposes, or more nefarious purposes such as spreading disinformation. The information can be used to conduct malicious attacks, political gains, financial crime, or fraud.

The battle was fought between the forces of Sawai Maharaja Ishwari Singh and Maharana Jagat Singh, who wanted to make his nephew Madho Singh the Maharaja of Jaipur or secure a Jagir for him, he built an alliance with the Maratha's under Khanderao Holkar and the Hada clan of Bundi and Kota. The battle resulted in a decisive victory for Ishwari Singh's forces.  History = Background = During the early 18th century, Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur rose to power in India.Sir Jadunath Sarkar (1994). A History of Jaipur 1503‚Äì1938. Orient Longman. . A member of the prominent Kachwaha caste, Jai transformed his domain into a powerful geopolitical force within the Mughal Empire. However, his death in 1743 resulted in a succession crisis to break out among the Kachawas. Jai's eldest son, Ishwari Singh, was named as the Maharaja of Jaipur per Kachwaha tradition; however, due to a treaty Jai had signed with his second wife's father-in-law, his youngest son Madho also had a claim to the throne. Despite having a claim to the throne of Jaipur, Madho Singh initially lacked the support to challenge Ishwari's rule. However, when his brother traveled to Delhi to make his introductions to Emperor Muhammad Shah, Madho revolted with the help of his uncle, Jagat Singh. The two began to gather forces around Jahajpur, where they remained for several weeks. However, during this time Ishwari had been altered to the rebellion and had returned to Jaipur city. He also paid Maratha soldiers so that they would support him if a battle broke out. Before a battle could take place, both sides agreed to reach a peaceful settlement. Under the terms of this agreement, Madho was given lands in Tonk and Toda to rule over on the condition that he not rebel against his brother. Representatives from both parties signed the peace accord on 19 December 1744, and so Jagat and Madho began to disband their army. However, Jagat Singh was unwilling (and possibly unable) to pay the Maratha mercenaries he had hired; the Maratha mercenaries attacked Madho Singh and burned their supplies. Madho and Jagat were forced to retreat to Udaipur. Seeing his brother's weakened position, Ishwari reneged on his earlier agreement and returned to Jaipur city, while Madho began to gather support among the Rajputs for a renewed attempt to overthrow his brother. = Battle = In March 1747, Jagat Singh and Madho Singh (with the help of Marathas under Khande Rao and the Hadas of Bundi and Kota) invaded Jaipur from the south and advanced to the city of Rajmahal. There they encountered an army under the command of Narayandas, a general of the Jaipur army. Not knowing the size of the invading army, the Jaipur general negotiated with Madho and his commanders. However, he soon uncovered that the invading force was relatively small and learned about friendly reinforcements that were approaching from Udaipur, and so he immediately attacked the invading armies. Fighting began on 1 March and continued through to 2 March; Narayandas decisively defeated wave after wave of the invading armies, while Khande Rao made an attempt to attack the Jaipur camp with a swift cavalry charge but was repelled by the Shekhawati guards. The battle finally ended at sunset. Under Narayandas' command, the Jaipur army successfully routed the disorganized invading army. Ishwari Singh arrived on the battlefield on 3 March to oversee the aftermath of his forces' victory. Madho Singh and his supporters were once again forced to flee Jaipur. Ishwari Singh Invaded Mewar and forced the Maharana to pay tribute, the rao of Kota also paid tribute to Jaipur. = Aftermath = The Battle of Rajamahal was a major victory for Ishwari Singh, who was able to consolidate his position as Maharaj of Jaipur. However, Madho, his supporters, and regional rivals of Jaipur would return and launch a second invasion of Jaipur in 1748.

It is an abstracted reclining human figure, with looped head, shoulders, and sinuous body and limbs. The sculpture draws on Moore's small terracotta 1938 Reclining Figure ( long, now lost) which was cast in bronze (LH 185, in an edition of 7+1: seven casts for sale, and one artist's copy). Moore scaled up the earlier sculpture up to carve in wood, creating a unique work which measures . It is one of six large reclining figures in elmwood carved by Moore between 1935 and 1978. The wide grain of elm made it a good choice for his larger carvings, and he uses the grain to emphasise different parts of the work. Moore sold the wooden sculpture to fellow artist Gordon Onslow Ford for ¬£300, and used the money to buy other half of his house, Hoglands, in Perry Green, Hertfordshire. The sculpture was acquired by the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1965.
