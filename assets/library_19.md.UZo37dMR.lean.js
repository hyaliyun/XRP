It is one of two families in the order Brisingida. The majority of species in this family are found in Antarctic waters and near Australia. Other species have been found near New Zealand and the United States. Taxonomy The starfish Brisinga endecacnemos was discovered in deep water off Norway in 1856, followed by another abyssal species, Brisinga coronata, now Hymenodiscus coronata. A new order, Brisingida, was erected to accommodate these, consisting of a single family, Brisingidae. Since then dozens of new species have been described from deep water habitats and in 1986, the American zoologist Maureen Downey split the family on morphological and behavioural grounds, creating the new family Freyellidae. Characteristics Members of this family have a small, Ophiurida-like disc, clearly demarcated from the arms, which number more than five. The disc is approximately circular with a rim of fused plates which gives rigidity. The madreporite is near the margin of the disc. The arms are long and tapering with the ratio of the arm length to the disc radius being greater than 6/1. There is an acute angle between the arms . After a narrow cylindrical portion, the part of the arms closest to the disc accommodates the gonadal tissues and widens out somewhat. Beyond this area, the arms taper to a long point. In all these aspects members of this family resemble members of Brisingidae, the other family in the order Brisingida. They differ from Brisingidae in having the interradial arcs curved, having smaller madreporites, having bare interadial plates on the disc, having the aboral (upper) surface of the arms continuous with the disc, and having the plates on the proximal parts of the arms abutting rather than overlapping each other. Biology Members of Freyellidae are usually found on soft substrates at depths between . This is a greater depth than Brisingidae, which occurs between , usually on hard surfaces. Because of the way their plates abut on the proximal ends of their arms, Freyellids have not been observed to raise their arms vertically above their discs, as do Brisingidae, and some are probably not suspension feeders. Some do however raise the distal portions of their arms, the parts beyond the gonadal regions.

David Beauchamp is thought to have been the first Chairman with Neil Clerehan Chairman 1977-80 and President subsequently. Graeme Butler was the founding Secretary and later Editor of the Council Journal, Historic Environment, which launched in 1980. Other office bearers included Miles Lewis (President), Helen Weston (Chair, Secretary, editor of Chen Chen, the Council newsletter), Ray Tonkin, Craig Wilson and Chris Smith (Secretary), Robert Knott and Wendy Jacobs (Treasurer). Formed as a break-away group from the National Trust of Victoria, the Council was made up of expert panels with each member with recognised expertise assigned to an appropriate panel, as follows: Architectural History, 20th Century Architecture; Architectural, Restoration, Preservation Technology; Conservation Planning, Urban History and Geography; Interior Design; and Landscape Planning. The Panel member list from 1979 included a number of individuals noted for heritage work in 1970s-90s : * Ralph Andrews * Bernard Barrett * David Beauchamp * Anne Bermingham * Alison Blake * Graeme Butler * Neil Clerehan * Carol Frank-Mas * John Hitch * Dewar Goode * Wendy Jacobs * Ian Johnson * David Johnston * John Kenny * Robert Knott * Miles Lewis * Nigel Lewis * Gordon Loader * Bill Logan * Peter Lovell * John Mitchell * Margaret Monk * John Murphy * Phyllis Murphy * Peter Navaretti * Ray Tonkin * Liz Vines * Stuart Warmington * Judith Wells * Helen Weston * Craig Wilson * Lawrie Wilson Although always focussing on process, the Council was active in early heritage battles such as the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne, which was proposed for demolition at the time, as well as the fight to preserve Carlton, Victoria. It also published a journal, Historic Environment, which was the first peer reviewed heritage focussed publication in Australia, and remains the primary outlet for discussion and debate on heritage matters in Australia. With the growth of Australia ICOMOS, state heritage bodies such as the Historic Buildings Council, later becoming Heritage Victoria, the Council for the Historic Environment merged with Australia ICOMOS. The Council successfully promoted the formation of an architectural drawing collection at the State Library of Victoria with a pilot survey of selected architectural practices in 1985-6. An architectural guidebook to the Melbourne region was also commenced but never reached finality.

Plot  The main character is a woman named Susan Juma who is currently the best secret agent at the Bureau of Investigative Operations, the Kenyan spy organization. B.I.O. employs highly trained operatives who secretly infiltrate the Kenyan government to keep the county safe. There have been a series of murders of government officials, so Susan and her boss/mentor at the B.I.O., Jackson Mwatata discuss the possible motives for the killing spree. Susan and Mwatata learn of a plot to overthrow the current government from an informant. This scheme was formulated by a mastermind who calls himself King Arthur, and his group of powerful followers the Knights of the Round Table. Their plan is to kill the Vice President of Kenya, which would destabilize the country so they can seize power. Shortly after the agents learn of this plot, Mwatata is killed, and Susan suspects B.I.O had been infiltrated by members of the Round Table. With no one else to turn to, Susan decides to contact Chain, an infamous retired field agent who is effective but aloof. The two hatch a plan to foil the Knights of the Round Table‚Äôs plot, but must get rid of the secret society themselves since they can only trust the other.  Style  This spy novel is written in third person omniscient, and Genya‚Äôs writing focuses on telling the audience about detailed actions and elaborate backstories. Reviewer for World Literature Today James Gibbs writes on the novel‚Äôs perception or reality: ‚ÄúThe author is more interested in action than character or community. As in other examples of the convention, there is, for example, little attempt to show the repercussions of violence on the wider community, and agents undertake casually dangerous assignments with inadequate backup. There is almost no attempt to explore the impact of brutal killings and scenes of carnage on the perpetrators and witnesses. The youthful supersleuth moves away from scene after scene of carnage with little more than a gulp.

Between 1834 and 1840 she visited Herne Bay regularly with friends, staying with Mr Camplin who owned number 8 (now 30) Marine Terrace on Central Parade, and became an established town benefactor of Herne Bay.Herne Bay Cultural Trail: Clock Tower, Central Parade Retrieved 23 November 2013 While there in 1836 she donated ¬£4,000 for the erection of the Clock Tower, which may have cost ¬£5,000 to build.Kentpol: Herne Bay Retrieved 23 November 2013 A blue plaque has been erected in her memory by City of Canterbury Council, at Central Parade near the Clock Tower.Open Plaques: Ann Thwaytes (1789‚Äì1866) Retrieved 24 November 2013 =Inspiration and planning= The Clock Tower was conceived within five years of the completion of Herne Bay's first pier of 1832, when the town was in the throes of its initial popularity and development. Herne Bay historian Mike Bundock suggests a possible inspiration for the unusual design of this tower. On the back of 31 Marine Terrace, next door to Mrs Thwaytes' holiday residence, was a Royal Exchange Assurance lead firemark badge which bore a picture of the Royal Exchange tower, designed by Edward Jarman in 1721.Number 31 was built in 1826, and the lead firemark, affixed to indicate insured properties, was in use from 1810 to 1835. Mrs Thwaytes was already familiar with the Royal Exchange tower, as she had lived close to it during her marriage.Image of Royal Exchange Assurance badge Retrieved 25 November 2013.

Note: it has been mistakenly repeated that the badge on Mrs Thwaite's house belonged to the Guardian Royal Exchange, but that company did not exist until 1968, as the result of a merger between Guardian Assurance Company (est.1821) and Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation (est.1720). In 1836, possibly inspired by the success of the nearby pier and the grandeur of this image, Mrs Thwaytes requested the young architect Edwin James Dangerfield (1807‚Äì1879) of London and Herne Bay to draw a plan of a tower in the style of a Grecian temple with a clock at the top.RIBA British architectural catalogue: Album of views of Gloucestershire churches: Tewkesbury deanery Retrieved 24 November 2013.

It was designed by Edwin James Dangerfield (1807‚Äì1879) of London and Herne Bay, and built by Ambrose Hukins (1788‚Äì1864), formerly of Chilham and Chartham and latterly of St Augustine's Cottage, William Street, Herne Bay.United Kingdom Census 1851 folio 371, p.43, 1625/HO107, showing him as a builder employing 8 men, born 1787 Chartham, age 64, living in Herne districtDeath cert: March 1864. Hukins Ambrose, Blean, 2a/483 =Design= The old Royal Exchange which may have inspired the Clock Tower The building was listed in 1951, and there is a full description of the design in the Listed Building entry 1085006. The eclectic Victorian design has been criticised by John Newman in the 1965 Buildings of England series. He speaks of an \\"inept design\\" and of a \\"classical vocabulary thus debased,\\" saying that the second stage of Corinthian columns should have been smaller than the first Doric stage of columns. He adds that the top is \\"hurriedly finished off.\\"Newman, John and Pevsner, Nikolaus, Kent: North East and East, Pevsner Architectural Guides (Yale University Press Academic, 2013) p.350, However this is not a formal state building. It is locally celebrated for what it is: an adornment of a holiday town where eccentric and humorous entertainment, and a gentle relaxation of workaday rules, have been the norm for nearly 200 years. =Structure= The building required deep foundations: \\"not solid but an elaborate series of arches and vaults,\\" being built close to the sea on shingle and just west of the culverted outflow of Plenty Brook, hence the total estimated cost of ¬£5,000. The vaults were infilled with concrete after inspection in 1964. The Tower's core is brick, with Portland stone cladding. The following legend is inscribed on the building: The gift of Mrs Ann Thwaytes to this town 11 Oct A.D. MDCCCXXXVII. Originally the Tower contained a clock mechanism and 12 cwt bell. In 1837 there were iron railings at the base around the steps but these were removed in 1937. =Clock mechanism and bell= Herne Bay Museum As of 2010, the original 1836 turret clock mechanism by John Moore Junior (later John Moore & Sons) was on display at Herne Bay Museum and Gallery, having been replaced in 1971. The mechanism is sometimes erroneously attributed to Peter Morton of Herne Bay and John Greenwood of Canterbury because their names are engraved on the front, however they were the suppliers and could not have manufactured such a large mechanism. This mechanism is listed in John Moore's 1877 catalogue as: \\"Herne Bay, Kent. Four 5ft dials, the gift of Mrs Thwaites (sic).\\" It was installed in the tower on a trestle and encased in a deal box, with doors for access to the winding mechanism. It had extra brass wheels for the striking bell, and was held in an iron frame. The clock had to be wound twice a week, the clock weights providing the stored energy. The pendulum was about long, giving a slow beat of nearly two seconds. The clock winder had to ascend 66 steps, then turn the heavy strike winder 75 times, and the time winder 20 times, using a crank. The bell, made of bell metal, was supplied by Thomas Mears II in 1837, weighs 12 cwt and measures high and diameter. The bell is still functioning in the Tower. The last long-serving clock winder, Louis Morgan, retired in 1964. The Council hired Peter Hutton between 1965 and 1970, then in 1971 installed a synchronous electric hour striking unit: two small black boxes installed by John Smith & Son of Derby. History =Laying the foundation stone= At midday on 3 October 1836 the foundation stone was laid by Ann Thwaytes. At 11 am gentlemen inhabitants, subscribers and visitors joined a procession at the St George's Baths and walked with the local charity school children (beneficiaries of Mrs Thwaytes) to the site to present her with a silver trowel. The ceremony was watched by invited ladies seated on a dais in a plantation decorated with flags, and enlivened by a military band. At 2 pm the charity children and their parents, totalling 500, received a free dinner provided by Mrs Thwaytes. In the afternoon there were boat races, a punt chase and a tightrope performance. On the Pier during the evening there was a Grand Illumination, a firework display, another tightrope performance, magic feats by Ching Lau Lauro, a model of the Clock Tower in fireworks, the Pier entrance illuminated by 30,000 variegated lamps, and a released balloon carrying Mrs Thwaytes' name in fire.Leaflet: Grand Festival at Herne Bay, printed for Mr Christy (director of amusements) by G. Smith of 7 Mortimer St, Herne Bay, 1836 An address of thanks to her was read by George Rohrs, secretary to the Clock Tower trustees who had been appointed by Mrs Thwaytes.Kentish Gazette 11 October 1836: Herne Bay =The opening ceremony= It was opened at twelve o'clock on Mrs Thwaytes' 48th birthday, 2 October 1837. A large triumphal arch intertwined with greenery and topped with flags was built close to the Clock Tower. Mrs Thwaytes, accompanied by Simm Smith and wearing a blue satin crinoline, was conveyed along the very short distance from her residence to the Clock Tower in the first of a train of carriages containing trustees of the Clock Tower and other personages bearing wands and wearing blue rosettes. This procession was preceded by blue and white flags and a band, and followed by a cheering multitude. On arrival at the site, the multitude cheered again loudly and hats were thrown. It was noted that Mrs Thwaytes was slightly unwell, but she thanked the crowd. Simm Smith read out her address in which she presented the Clock Tower to the town. At the beginning and end of the ceremony a salute was fired from the four fog-warning cannon on the pier, and a free meal was provided for a hundred charity children, their parents, and the construction workers who built the Tower. Large numbers of gentlemen ate dinners and drank toasts at the Kent and Pier hotels. In the evening there was a firework display and a clock tower in variegated fire created by Mr Fewick who had been in charge of fireworks at the 1836 ceremony.Kent Herald, 5 October 1837: Herne Bay Opening Day was also celebrated by villagers in Herne which was festooned with decorations following Mrs Thwaytes' distribution of money, food and goods.Kentish Gazette 10 October 1837 Celebrations on the anniversary of this opening ceremony and Mrs Thwaytes' birthday continued until at least 1839 when the gentry enjoyed a dinner, ball and concert.Kentish Gazette, 8 October 1839 =Early history= Pier by Fred C. Palmer, before 1914 On the north-east and north-west corners of the steps two cannon were placed, some time after 1900. They are possibly Dutch in origin, and were found on the seabed on 11 January and 10 April 1899 during the construction of the third Herne Bay Pier. They fired blanks as a fog-warning, and had been mounted on the first Pier until 1862. New carriages and brass plates dating the recovery were made for them. They stood outside the old Pier Theatre and were moved later to the base of the Tower. A plaque, dedicated to the 36 fallen Herne Bay volunteers of the Second Boer War, was affixed shortly after 1902 to the north side.YoungsTypesetting.org.uk: Herne Bay Guide 2013 Retrieved 23 November 2013 It features some well-known local surnames, such as Ridout.KentFallen.com: Herne Bay Clock Tower: image of memorial plaque to the Boer War fallen Retrieved 23 November 2013 Clock Tower in 1895, by Francis Frith =20th century= The building was listed as Grade II on 29 September 1951.

Renovation and repairs =1905 repairs and accident= Clock Tower 1899‚Äì1905 The Tower was renovated in 1905 due to weather-erosion of the Portland stone. The clock dials were converted to white opal glass. Three of the dials were illuminated by gas, but the seaward-facing dial was not, being disallowed by the Admiralty. The worn stone pillars were to be rotated by 180¬∞ to hide the worn areas, and builders A.S. Ingleton and J. Masters were hired. Scaffolders Spratt and Griggs were working on the morning of Saturday 13 May 1905, and stopped for a tea break. Spratt went home while Edward Henry Griggs sheltered inside the base of the Tower. One of the hemp strike-weight ropes broke, and the by diameter iron strike weight, weighing about 5 cwt, crashed through two floors and \\"smashed to a pulp\\" Griggs' thighs as he sat on the floor drinking his tea. The noise brought the nearby lavatory attendant, who brought a clerk called Wacher, who sent for the doctor Tom Bowes and the Ambulance Corps who took Griggs to the Queen Victoria Memorial Cottage Hospital where he had both legs amputated but died at 11.30am, aged 32 years and leaving a wife and four children. The clock-winder Alfred Smith was an old man, having started this job before 1847. He stopped the clock at 9.45 am and removed the other clock weight. He told the inquest that the hemp ropes were due for replacement and that he had unsuccessfully requested new ropes from the Council, on three occasions during the previous two months. There was a big local funeral on Tuesday 6 May, and the Council started a fund for the relief of the widow. Alfred Smith retired around 1907. =2009 repairs= In 2009 a complaint to City of Canterbury Council about the Tower clock not working elicited a reply and a full repair within one month.Fix My Street: Herne Bay Clock Tower Retrieved 23 November 2013 =21st century repairs= Tower, 2008 In 2012, City of Canterbury Council initiated a ¬£348,000 project and applied for Lottery funding to renovate the structure which had been eroded by salt water and gales.

Running from March 6, 1880, to May 11, 1907, Golden Days cost subscribers only $3 a year. It was the brainchild of newspaperman James Elverson (1838‚Äì1911), who later owned the Philadelphia Inquirer. The first printing of this paper had an output of three million copies, and by the second number, had 52,000 subscribers. According to a newspaper advertisement in 1885, the 16 page weekly had a circulation above 70,000 by this year. Another ad circa 1888 puts the number somewhere between 110,000 and 120,000 weekly sales, being distributed from coast to coast in the United States. Golden Days featured stories, activities and lessons which were mostly gender-specific, with separate stories appealing to boys and girls. Many of the stories were serialized over several issues; a measure designed to drive increased weekly sales. The themes largely involved school, athletics, westerns and the frontier, travel, exploration, adventure, the sea, and success stories. The paper also included a weekly puzzle page, Puzzledom; a section for advice and responses to the young readers, the Letter Box; and a weekly Bible lesson and devotional titled \\"International Lessons\\", provided by such persons as Rev. D. P. Kidder, D. D. and Rev C. E. Strobridge, D. D.

It was developed in 2011 by Professor Hubert H. Girault‚Äôs group at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland.Qiao, L., Sartor, R., Gasilova, N., Lu, Y., Tobolkina, E., Liu, B. H., Girault, H. H., Anal. Chem. 2012, 84, 7422-7430. In a typical ESTASI process, a droplet of a protic solvent containing analytes is deposited on a sample area of interest which itself is mounted to an insulating substrate. Under this substrate and right below the droplet, an electrode is placed and connected with a pulsed high voltage (HV) to electrostatically charge the droplet during pulsing. When the electrostatic pressure is larger than the surface tension, droplets and ions are sprayed. ESTASI is a contactless process based on capacitive coupling. One advantage of ESTASI is, that the electrode and sample droplet act contact-less avoiding thereby any oxidation or reduction of the sample compounds at the electrode surface, which often happens during standard electrospray ionization (ESI).M. Abonnenc, L. Qiao, B. Liu and H. H. Girault, Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry 2010, 3, 231-254. ESTASI is a powerful new ambient ionization technique that has already found many applications in the detection of different analytes, such as organic molecules, peptides and proteins with molecule weight up to 70 kDa.Qiao, L., Sartor, R., Gasilova, N., Lu, Y., Tobolkina, E., Liu, B. H., Girault, H. H., Anal. Chem. 2012, 84, 7422-7430. Furthermore, it was used to couple MS with various separation techniques including capillary electrophoresis and gel isoelectric focusing,Qiao, L., Sartor, R., Gasilova, N., Lu, Y., Tobolkina, E., Liu, B. H., Girault, H. H., Anal. Chem. 2012, 84, 7422-7430.Huang G., Li G., Cooks, R. G., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 9907‚Äì9910. and it was successfully applied under atmospheric pressure to the direct analysis of samples with only few preparation steps.Qiao, L., Tobolkina, E., Liu, B. H., Girault, H. H., Anal. Chem. 2013, 85, 4745-4752.  Principle of operation  ESTASI is a contactless electrospray ionization (ESI) method, like dielectric barrier ESIStark A. K., Meyer C., Kraehling T., Jestel G., Marggraf U., Schilling M., Janasek D., Franzke J., Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2011, 561‚Äì569. and induced or inductive ESI.Huang G., Li G., Cooks, R. G., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 9907‚Äì9910. In ESTASI, an electrode is placed close to a sample only separated by an insulation layer. The sample is covered with a droplet of solution (nano-liters to micro-liters); and a square wave HV is applied between the electrode and the mass spectrometer inlet capillary. Sample ionization occurs and ions are collected for mass spectrometry analysis. The square wave HV can be generated by amplifying the square wave voltage of a function generator. Alternatively, it can be produced by an electric circuit comprising one direct current HV power source and two switches that connect the electrode either to the HV source or to the ground.Schematic illustration of the working principle of ESTASI, HV: high voltage; MS inlet: the ion transfer capillary of a mass spectrometer. When a positive HV is applied to the electrode with respect to the mass spectrometer, a spray of cations is generated out of the droplet containing the sample analytes because of the strong electric filed between the electrode and the mass spectrometer. Excess anions stay inside the droplet on the substrate and are subsequently sprayed when grounding the electrode. In this way, both cations and anions are subsequently measured by mass spectrometry in one experiment.  Applications  ESTASI method can be applied to a wide range of geometries, e.g. samples in capillary, in a disposable pipette tip, in a polymer microchannel and in micro-, nano-liter droplets on a polymer or porous plate. With the last geometry, molecules on a surface can be directly ionized for MS detection by simply adding a droplet of buffer that can dissolve the target molecule. The current developed applications of ESTASI mainly include: = Interfacing capillary electrophoresis (CE) and MS analysis = Fractions of proteins or peptides from capillary electrophoresis were collected on an insulating plastic slide. Dry sample spots were formed by evaporating all solvents and then analyzed by ESTASI MS where droplets of acidic solution (1% acetic acid in water) were deposited on the dry sample spots to dissolve analytes from the sample. This is the first application and example of direct analysis of samples on a plat surface. = Interfacing gel electrophoresis and MS analysis = Samples inside porous matrices can also be analyzed by the ESTASI MS. During gel electrophoresis, peptides or proteins can be fractionated into different bands inside a gel. The gel is then placed on an insulating plastic plate for ESTASI MS analysis. The extraction of proteins/peptides from the gel for ESTASI MS analysis is realized by depositing a highly acidic solution droplet and by applying an HV. The protons migrate into the gel to protonate peptides/proteins inside the gel band and then the cations are extracted by the HV into the acidic droplet for ESTASI MS analysis.Qiao, L., Tobolkina, E., Liu, B. H., Girault, H. H., Anal. Chem. 2013, 85, 4745-4752. = Ambient ionization MS for direct analysis of samples with minimal preparation = ESTASI of many sample types can be carried without specific sample pre-treatments. One example is the fast analysis of perfume, where the perfume is directly sprayed on a smelling paper to form micro- nano-liter droplets, from which the ESTASI is generated.E. Tobolkina, L. Qiao, G.

University College Roosevelt (UCR), formerly known as Roosevelt Academy, is a small, selective, honors undergraduate liberal arts and science college located in Middelburg in the Netherlands and the sole university in Zeeland. It offers a residential setting, and is an international honors college of Utrecht University. History Middelburg's former City Hall, now UCR's main academic building Founding Dean, Prof.Hans Adriaansens, was unhappy with what he saw as the undemanding, large-scale climate of university education in the Netherlands. He started developing the idea of a small scale and academically intensive undergraduate college in the Netherlands after experiencing the ground principles of the Liberal Arts education during his brief time as a visiting professor at Smith College, USA, in the 1980-1981 academic year. This resulted in the founding of University College Utrecht in 1998, the first honors college in the Netherlands. A few years later, following the success of this first college in Utrecht, Hans Adriaansens started working on the establishment of a new university in his home town, Middelburg. As he was facing local opposition, Adriaansens formulated a compelling argument to convince the locals: when William of Orange was about to found the first university in the Netherlands, in 1575, Middelburg was considered as a possible venue, but eventually the University of Leiden was founded. Middelburg and the whole of Zeeland would not get a university until centuries later, when the Roosevelt Academy opened in 2004. Based in Middelburg's former Gothic City Hall, this college was to be following the same principles of Liberal Arts education as the Utrecht counterpart. It was named in honor of the Roosevelt family, particularly Franklin, Eleanor and Theodore, due to their ancestry originating in the Dutch province of Zeeland. The Roosevelt Academy was officially founded on 23 January 2004 and the first students enrolled in August of that year, after Queen Beatrix performed the official opening of the university.Middelburg en de Oranjes On 5 February 2013 Roosevelt Academy changed its name to University College Roosevelt, to avoid ambiguity on the nature of the institution and to present itself explicitly as a university college.RA becomes UCR! Traditions at UCR include the Convocation held every year in Middelburg's New Church. The procession of Notables and professors can be seen walking from the City Hall to the New Church, where the official ceremonies are held. When the weather permits it, graduation ceremonies take place in the adjacent Abbey Square. There is also the Dies Natalis, the celebration of the founding of the college, which takes place every five years, as well as IntRoweek at the beginning of every semester to welcome new students, Culture Week, and a yearly Christmas Gala. Organization and financing University College Roosevelt, or UCR, is an international Honors college of Utrecht University, offerering a Liberal Arts and Science program. In 2005, the Dutch government (which funds all higher education) ceased financial support for the academy, to which it had given close to a million euros the previous year. This amounted to 20% of the university's operating budget. The government thought the academy's independent construction might create a precedent. In 2007, an agreement was made that allows the academy to be financially independent, and self- sufficient. The academy is now financed in part by the Middelburg municipality. Academics Students in the college enroll in a wide variety of courses across three different discipline areas: Arts & Humanities, Social Sciences and Science. Some of these courses include PreMed, Law, History and Performing Arts. Students can create their own program and choose different academic disciplines to combine. They are only required to declare a major at the end of their first year. After three years of successful study at UCR, students are awarded an Utrecht University Honors BA or BSc degree. De NVAO (Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Organization) has given University College Roosevelt \\"excellence\\" status. NVAO chairman Karl Dittrich stated during the opening of the academic year in Middelburg (September 2009) that a \\"Liberal Arts and Sciences degree is an example to the Netherlands and other countries.\\" =Admissions= The university admits 200 students each academic year from about 500 applications received. Approximately half of the students come from the Netherlands while the others hail from all over the world. Tuition fees are set slightly higher than regular public universities in the Netherlands. =Rankings= In 2008, the influential magazine Elsevier ranked UCR as the top liberal arts college in the Netherlands, for the third time in four years; the academy received high marks for the quality of the education and the mentoring of the students. University College Roosevelt knows graduation percentages which are very high in comparison to regular Dutch universities. 82% of its students graduate (with a national average of 46%) and 93% of its students graduate within the 3 years (national average of 28%). In 2011, the Keuzegids Onderwijs 2011, ranked UCR as the number one University College in The Netherlands with an 8.4. In 2012 however, it fell to second place, with a 7.8, with University College Maastricht in first place with an 8.6. Accreditation and ranking =Exchange programs= Students may study abroad during their fourth or fifth semester. Students earn credits towards their UCR degree while at a wide variety of universities around the world. Options include locations through the Utrecht University exchange network. UCR also has direct exchange agreements with the Honors Program at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, USA, Bard College in New York, USA, and with Glendon College in Toronto, Canada.UCR Exchange Opportunities Campus Middelburg City Hall =Academic buildings= The University College Roosevelt campus is located near the market square in Middelburg behind the medieval city hall, which was built in 1452 and is often used by the college for ceremonial purposes. The city, which owns the building, began renting the annexed offices to the university college in 2006 when the new city hall was completed. The newer, non-gothic section of the city hall is known as Franklin Hall and was rented to the academy from its beginning. Other university buildings include Theodore and Eleanor. These buildings house classrooms, computer labs, and faculty and administrative offices. Next to these, the Common House Elliott, in the former post office of Middelburg, is a building that contains classrooms, a study area, a bar with a lounge area and a basement bar for parties. Elliott is completely run by students, organized in the Common House Elliott Foundation. =Residence halls= Almost all students live in one of the residential halls, Bagijnhof, Roggeveenhof, Koestraat or Bachtensteene, all within Middelburg. These halls house between 100-200 students each and are spread throughout the city. Others live on small campus locations housing between 1 and 16 students at Zusterstraat, Hof van Sint Pieter or Zuidsingel =Library, bookstore and journal= UCR's official academic bookstore is De Drukkery, located on the market square. Students have full access to the Zeeland Library (the largest library in the province) and can use the digital library of Utrecht University. University College Roosevelt publishes an annual academic journal, Ad Astra (to the stars), that publishes noteworthy student essays and papers. Student organizations =Roosevelt's All Students Association (RASA)= The Roosevelt's All Students Association (RASA) consists of a chair, a treasurer, a secretary and three committee affairs officers (CAOs). The role of RASA is to make \\"UCR a stimulating and outreaching community, through promoting contact between members, representing their interests, maintaining key traditions and providing a framework in which its members' initiatives and diversity can flourish\\". SportsCo, Cooking Society, Roosevelt Debating Society (RDS), CultureCo, UCRadio, PoLaw, LENSE, GamesCo, Participating Uniting Middelburg Association (PUMA), Music Society, Tabula RASA, Archimedes, PRISM, THEATRA, Partyteam, RAW, Cognition, PhiloCom, LitRA and MedAffairs are all student-run societies.

The Mosque represents a splendid design of old Muslim architecture. Mehmood Ghaznavi Masjid  Discovery of an Arabic Inscription  In 1984 an inscription in Arabic engraved on a black marble was found by chance on the slopes of the hill below the castle of Raja Gira. The inscription attests to the foundation of a mosque in HE 440 (1048‚Äì49 CE) ordered by Amir Nustagin, a Ghaznavid General (known to the history only through this inscription).Swat Archeological Museum- A Brief Guide, Saidu Sharif, 2013  Excavation of the site (1985-1999)  The excavation carried out in the area between 1985 and 1999 brought to light a hypostyle mosque with supports originally in wood. The mosque occupies an early artificial terrace with remains of Gandharan masonry.  Architectural style of the building  After uncovering the ruins, the most striking aspects were traces of 30-foot-high walls, a graveyard, common rooms, student rooms and a water mill. The walls also show traces of a Buddhist stupa that was constructed before the mosque was made. The mosque follows the same basic pattern of mosque construction and is rectangular in plan, measuring 28m by 21m. It has high walls of schist stone laid in rough diaper masonry all around it. The roof is no longer in evidence but the stone bases of wooden pillars remain, numbering 5 running north to south and 8 running east to west. The mehrab is in the center of the west wall with an off center entrance to the east wall opposite this. The prayer chamber (of which the mehrab is a part) is a step higher and composed of a beaten earth floor. The remaining area is paved in schist stone slabs and corresponds to the courtyard area, having an ablution tank in the middle. To the north of the building is a series of three rooms or hujras called the \\"ziyada\\" which are all oblong in shape. The exterior of this side also contains three bastions or towers which both give the image of a Hindu Shahi style and also that of a Ribat. The mehrab is square, which marks it as a pre-Seljuk element.http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/history/Current%20Issues/Tauqeer%20Ahmad%20Warraich.pdf  History  Unearthed on the slopes of Odigram mountain by the Italian Archaeological Mission, the mosque was originally called Raja Gira Mosque as it was situated in the vicinity of the Raja Gira Castle. It is not to be confused with Raja Griha in India. The Mosque of Odigram date back to the period of Mahmud or his grandson Maudud (1041‚Äì50 A.D.) and is therefore to be considered to be the earliest of Northern Pakistan. The people settled there around the tomb of a saint upon which a small and simple mausoleum was erected. In fact, it is the tomb of the General of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi named- Pir Khushal, who defeated Raja Gira and embraced martyrdom there. The tomb is popular in the people with the name of Ghazi Baba tomb. This historical mosque is a place for visitor attractions when people visit Swat in summer.

Dibia‚Äôs third novel follows a complex story of romance and revenge set against the social and political climate of contemporary Nigeria, often told through flashbacks and dream sequences. Plot Blackbird opens on preparations for an armed home invasion. Three men‚ÄîScorpion, Razor, and Cobra‚Äîdiscuss the logistical details of perpetrating their crime in a wealthy compound, an event later revealed as the infamous rape and murder of socialite, Katherine Cole. Cole‚Äôs murder becomes a sort of touchstone throughout the novel, serving as a litmus to gauge attitudes towards race and social mobility in the face of systemic corruption and violent urban development. (Dibia‚Äôs depiction of an urban Nigerian ordinary is critical, and comments on the prevalence of everyday crime, corruption, and entrenched economic inequity.) The story then turns to Maya and Omoniyi, the middle-class parents of Deji, a child suffering from leukemia. For Maya and Omoniyi, supporting their son‚Äôs medical needs is difficult. Omoniyi becomes the victim of a wave of chronic unemployment and is laid off from his office job in a shoe factory; Maya is forced, against her husband‚Äôs wishes, to sing at local restaurant in order to supplement the family income. Family luck, however, changes when Maya is approached by a wealthy hotel manager, Edward, after her performance at a private party. Omoniyi and Maya are offered and accept employment, room, and board at The Oasis Hotel. Meanwhile, Edward and his wife, Nduesoh, suffer the everyday pains of a mismatched marriage. Interested in Nduesoh originally for her ‚Äúexotic‚Äù appearance, Edward fashions for the couple a life insulated from anything that Nduesoh knew before, while engaging himself in a development scheme to displace the urban poor. She hardens in her role among the other rich wives, lamenting the racial divide within her elite social circle and the rumors surrounding Edward‚Äôs infidelity. The lives of the two couples cross when Edward invites Maya to sing at the hotel. Soon jealous of the girl, Nduesoh directs her repressed anger and emotion towards Omoniyi, on whom she forces herself as he cleans her penthouse suite. Omoniyi later learns of Edward‚Äôs attention toward Maya, and conspires with Nduesoh in a plot to stalk her husband. Owing a favor to an old friend, Omoniyi enlists the aid of Ade (also known as \\"Scorpion\\"), a local thug, to follow Edward‚Äôs every move. Nduesoh‚Äôs sister, Idara, is engaged to be married to Gabriel, a local police officer working on Scorpion‚Äôs case. Recognizing Scorpion‚Äôs mugshot among others in her husband‚Äôs paperwork, Idara tips off the police regarding Scorpion‚Äôs whereabouts. In a police raid thwarted by Scorpion‚Äôs gang members, both Nduesoh and Gabriel are killed. For alleged conspiracy and for harboring wanted criminals, both Edward and Omoniyi are sent to prison. Before his release, Edward informs Ominiyi that Maya, too, was found dead. Omoniyi writes daily to his deceased wife and to Deji apologizing for his involvement. Eventually, he is released into the custody of his sister, Ogoma, who informs him that his wife is, in fact, alive. Maya had been unable to reach Omoniyi in jail and doubted, if momentarily, his innocence in the events. Upon receiving the mass of letters Omoniyi had been writing, Maya forgives her husband and believes his account of the story. Dibia‚Äôs novel closes on the image of a blackbird that had bolstered Omoniyi‚Äôs spirits in jail.

The regiment was composed of African American enlisted men commanded by white officers and was authorized by the Bureau of Colored Troops which was created by the United States War Department on May 22, 1863. Organization  The 11th Regiment, United States Colored Troops was recruited out of Fort Smith in the fall and winter of 1863‚Äì64, shortly after the Union had recaptured the post from Confederate forces. The unit was recruited from former slaves from Ft. Smith, Van Buren, Dripping Springs, Kibler, Alma and other local communities. In addition, several men who had been enslaved in nearby Choctaw Nation, heard about the opportunity to join and slipped into Arkansas and joined the 11th US Colored Infantry.Angela Y.

The unit was first assigned to post and garrison duty at Fort Smith. They spent most of their time drilling and performing routine duties such as working on the earthwork fortifications that surrounded the town of Fort Smith, serving as guards, and participating in any formal dress parades. It was in the summer of 1864 that the unit saw its first real military action. In mid-July of that year, the five companies of the 11th USCT, numbering 265 effective men, moved into Indian Territory. Their assignment was to guard government stock and a haying party operating at Gunther's Prairie, 12 miles northwest of Fort Smith. At daybreak on August 24, an estimated 300 to 400 Confederate cavalry, both white and Indian, attacked this force. The fighting lasted until 7:30 that morning and some firing continued as late as 10 a.m. According to military records, for one hour the contest was close and the fire almost incessant. The Confederates made three separate charges and were repulsed each time and finally were compelled to retreat. The loss to the force is unknown but the 11th USCT had 3 men killed and 14 missing or wounded. The unit remained at the Ft. Smith post until November 1864 when they were moved eastward to Lewisburg, in Conway County, Arkansas. The 11th saw action again at Boggs's Mill on January 24, 1865. On the night of the January 24, a detachment of Colonel Robert C. Newton‚Äôs 10th Arkansas Confederate Cavalry Regiment seized the mill, located twelve miles from Dardanelle in Yell County, in order to grind flour.Steven L.

Steele, leading the 11th USCT, surprised the Confederate force, capturing eighteen horses and twenty stands of arms, as well as all of the flour and Newton‚Äôs papers. The regiment then returned to garrison duty at both Little Rock and Lewisburg until April, 1865.  Mustered out of service  In late April 1865, after the surrender of Lee's army in Virginia, the unit was officially consolidated with the 112th and the 113th United States Colored Infantry to form the new 113th U.S. Colored Troops on April 22, 1865. They were mustered out a year later, on April 9, 1866.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 8, 2011. It is located at 4535 North Main Street, in the city's Northside area. History In 1880 organizers of Evergreen Cemetery conceived of establishing a centrally located cemetery in Jacksonville. J. J. Daniel and directors of Evergreen purchased 200 acres of land for their project at $25 an acre. The first burial at Evergreen Cemetery took place on April 8, 1881, for Margaret Jamison. An on-site railroad depot was built in the cemetery for better access to visitors via the Jacksonville-Fernandina Railroad. A section of the cemetery was established in 1885 for those who died during the Yellow fever epidemic in Jacksonville. At the turn of the 20th century, Evergreen became a non-profit association. First Board President Arthur G. Cummer and the board purchased an additional 22 acres from nearby Woodlawn Cemetery. The City of Jacksonville ceded back its pauper cemetery to Evergreen north of the cemetery. In 1969 an on-site business office was built near the entrance to the cemetery.

Pinocchio, however, starts running all over the city, sowing weeds between one street and another, until he is stopped by two carabinieri. When Pinocchio refuses to go home, the carabinieri, hearing people think that Geppetto is probably violent with the puppet, arrest him and let go of Pinocchio. Despite criticism from a talking cricket, who Pinocchio silences with a hammer, Pinocchio goes home, and dreams of his life as a vagabond who he intends to do. When Geppetto returns, the next morning, Pinocchio, having burned his feet, agrees to behave well and to start going to school.

It is directed by Paul McGuigan and written by Max Landis, and stars James McAvoy as Victor Frankenstein and Daniel Radcliffe as Igor. The film was released by 20th Century Fox on November 25, 2015. Told from Igor's perspective, it shows the troubled young assistant's dark origins and his redemptive friendship with the young medical student, Victor Frankenstein. Through Igor's eyes, the audience witnesses the emergence of Frankenstein as the man from the legend we know today. Eventually, their experiments get them into trouble with the authorities, and Dr. Frankenstein and Igor become fugitives as they complete their goals to use science as a way to create life from death. The film received generally negative reviews and became a box office bomb, grossing $34.2 million against a budget of $40 million. Plot In 1870's London, ambitious medical student Victor Frankenstein attends a circus performance, where he helps save an injured aerialist, Lorelei, with the aid of a nameless hunchback enslaved by the circus' ringleader, who harbors feelings for the girl. Impressed by the hunchback's vast knowledge of human anatomy, acquired from stolen books, Victor rescues him, drains the cyst on his back that causes his physical abnormality and gives him a harness to improve his posture - he then names him \\"Igor Straussman\\" after his roommate who is not often at home. The two then become partners in Victor's ongoing experiments to resurrect life through artificial means, incurring the wrath of devoutly religious police inspector Roderick Turpin, who views their experiments as blasphemy. When Victor shows Igor his use of electricity to animate eyes, Igor suggests he made mistakes attaching the nerves, leading Victor to ask Igor to perform the surgical parts of his experiment. Victor procures parts from dead animals and makes Igor restore the organs, which Victor secretly uses to create a monstrous chimpanzee-like creature nicknamed \\"Gordon\\". Igor reunites with Lorelei, now masquerading as the mistress of a closeted gay baron, upsetting Victor, who views Lorelei as a distraction. Igor invites Lorelei to a demonstration of their experiment, which goes awry when Gordon escapes and wreaks havoc through the university before being killed by Victor and Igor. Lorelei is horrified by Victor's experiments and urges Igor to stop him from pursuing the matter further, but Igor is reluctant to do so upon learning that Victor is driven by the need to atone for his indirect role in the death of his older brother, Henry, for which Victor's domineering father blames Victor. Victor is expelled from college for his unorthodox methods, but attracts the attention of his wealthy, arrogant classmate Finnegan, who wants him to create an artificial humanoid creature. Victor and Igor outline a behemoth named \\"Prometheus\\", but Igor's deepening relationship with Lorelei soon causes a rift between them. Turpin and his men raid Victor's laboratory, hell-bent on destroying his inventions. During the raid Igor stumbles onto the corpse of the real Igor Straussman, dead from an overdose, and the source of the eyes Victor had used in his experiments When he attacks Victor, Turpin loses a hand and is blinded in one eye. Victor and Igor escape in a carriage sent by Finnegan and are taken to his family's estate. Turpin is fired from Scotland Yard for having invaded Victor's home without a warrant. Finnegan provides the scientists with the necessary funds to build Prometheus and offers them laboratory facilities at his family's estate in Scotland. Igor is suspicious of Finnegan and outraged with Victor for his treatment of the original Igor. After a falling out, Victor departs for Scotland alone. Finnegan kidnaps and binds Igor, revealing his plans to kill Victor once Prometheus is complete and weaponize his creation. Igor is then thrown into the River Thames to drown, but manages to escape and reunites with Lorelei, who nurses him back to health. Igor and Lorelei embark to Finnegan's estate in order to rescue Victor. Igor finds Victor on the verge of using lightning to animate Prometheus. Victor ignores Igor's pleas and activates the machine. A power surge overloads the machinery, killing Finnegan. During the ensuing chaos, Turpin unexpectedly arrives, blaming and threatening Victor for his creation. Prometheus suddenly steps forward. Victor is initially ecstatic that the experiment has worked, sharing a brief moment with Prometheus, thinking him to be his resurrected brother Henry. Victor quickly realizes that the experiment has failed: Prometheus has no consciousness and can not talk. The shocked Turpin opens fire on Prometheus, who goes into a rage, killing Turpin and nearly killing Victor. Return to his senses, Victor joins forces with Igor to kill Prometheus by stabbing its two hearts. After regaining consciousness the next morning, Igor reunites with Lorelei, who hands him a letter written to him by Victor, in which Victor apologizes for all the suffering he caused, says he is allowed to live his life with Lorelei, informs him to be ready for when Victor may one day ask for his help, and Victor recognizes Igor was his \\"greatest creation\\". Victor retreats to the Scottish countryside in search of new discoveries.

The result is far from monstrous but it's hardly divine, either.\\" In response to the low score on Rotten Tomatoes, writer Max Landis wrote that the site \\"breaks down entire reviews into just the word 'yes' or 'no', making criticism binary in a destructive arbitrary way\\".

Arthur and his wife resided at number 8. In 1873, he married (Eugenie) Louise (Perugia) Sassoon (1854-1943), daughter of Signor Achille Perugia of Trieste, Italy, whose sister Marie Perugia (1862‚Äì1937) was married to Leopold de Rothschild (1845-1917).'The Late Leopold de Rothschild', Canadian Jewish Chronicle, 22 June 1917 Louise became a leading socialite in London high society, and her work with poor Jewish girls led to her being appointed CBE. Her portrait was painted by George Frederic Watts (1817-1904) in 1882.Art UK It is displayed in Tate Britain.Tate For many years the couple resided in Hove, East Sussex. In 1881 they were recorded as living at 6 Queen's Gardens, part of a sea-facing terrace of seven late-19th-century mansions. (These were damaged by bombs in World War II and demolished in the 1960s; flats called Kingsway Court now occupy the site.) With a staff of 13 servants, cooks and butlers, they were \\"one of the largest employers of domestic staff in Hove\\". Sassoon's brother Reuben lived next door at number 7. From 1883 until Arthur Sassoon's death, they lived at 8 King's Gardens, a Grade II-listed building.Marcus Roberts, Brighton & Hove: History, National Anglo-Jewish Trail Sassoon was a personal friend and confidante of King Edward VII (1841‚Äì1910).Jane Ridley, Bertie: A Life of Edward VII, Random House, 2012, p. 430 Adam Trimingham, A grand day out, The Argus, 1 July 2013Christopher Hibbert, Edward VII: The Last Victorian King, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007, p. 287 The King would often stay with him on his visits to Brighton, sometimes to visit his mistress Alice Keppel (1868‚Äì1947). Moreover, Arthur Sassoon would accompany him on day trips to the Worthing Pier and the gardens of Beach House, the private residence of Sir Edmund Giles Loder, 2nd Baronet (1849-1920). Another guest was Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821‚Äì1890).Isabel Burton, The Life of Captain Sir Richard F. Burton, Asian Educational Services, 1999, p. 135 Known visits by the King to the Sassoons' house were in 1898, 1907, 1908 and 1910, but other visits are believed to have gone unrecorded. He felt his bronchitis and asthma improved when he visited the Sussex coast, so his visits were not merely social. Edward VII was also an occasional guest of Arthur Sassoon at Tulchan Lodge, Advie, Morayshire, during the shooting season on the Scottish moors. After the King's death in May 1910, Arthur Sassoon paid ¬£100 towards a memorial sculpture.

Sassoon's photogravure, done by Walker & Boutall in 1897, rests in the National Portrait Gallery in London. He is also commemorated by four stained glass windows in the Middle Street Synagogue, Brighton. His fortune, which exceeded ¬£650,000, passed to the children of his brother Reuben.

Biography Samuel Minturn Peck was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama on November 4, 1854, the youngest of nine children of Elisha Wolsey Peck and Lucy Lamb Randall. In 1865, the family moved to Illinois before returning to Tuscaloosa two years later, where his father became a justice for the state Supreme Court.Williams, p. 135 Peck earned a master's degree from the University of Alabama in 1871 and went on to get a medical degree in 1879 from Bellevue Hospital Medical College in order to please his parents, despite his literary ambitions. It was while he was a medical student that, in 1878, he published his first poem, \\"The Orange Tree\\", in the New York Post. His first book, Cap and Bells, was published in 1886. His father died two years later and, with his inheritance, he traveled to Europe. He published several more books of verse, earning him a reputation as an unpretentious author of vers de soci√©t√©. In 1930, he was given the honorary position of Poet Laureate of Alabama, the first to hold the title, which he held until his death in 1938. The title was made specifically in his honor and was not again filled until 1954.Going, p. 190 Peck died May 3, 1938.Cuff, Roger Penn. \\"An Appraisal of the American Poets Laureate\\" in Peabody Journal of Education. Vol. 25, No. 4 (January 1948): 157. Poetic style and response Peck was known as a simple, unchallenging writer with easy to understand poems that flowed easily. Between 1886 and 1925, he published seven volumes of poetry in addition to various poems published in newspapers like the Boston Transcript. Among his most famous poems is \\"The Grapevine Swing\\" (1892), which was frequently recited by schoolchildren.Going, p. 191 Upon the publication of his second book, one critic praised his \\"light verse, admirably written\\" and his \\"simple melodies\\" that were \\"rhythmically smooth\\".Anonymous review of Peck's Rings and Love- Knots from The Critic. November 26, 1892, p. 293. Many of his poems were set to music by a variety of composers including Thomas G. Shepard. As Peck himself noted, \\"In the making of my verses I have striven for simplicity, grace, and beauty. I have felt that sublimity was beyond my power to achieve.\\"Hulme, William Henry. \\"Samuel Minturn Peck\\" in Southern Writers: Biographical and Critical Studies. Nashville, TN: Publishing House of M. E. Church, Vol. II: 309. Peck showed an obvious dislike of less traditional poetic forms and privately noted his dislike for more avant garde poets including Amy Lowell, Ezra Pound, Harriet Monroe, and fellow Alabama writer Clement Wood, whom he satirized in his poem \\"The Poet and the Pixie\\".Going, p. 193 After the turn of the century, even Peck admitted he had become \\"somewhat pass√©\\".Going, p. 194 Less often, Peck experimented with writing prose. In the 1890s, he attempted to replicate the success of local color stories by writers like Mary Noailles Murfree, Thomas Nelson Page, and Joel Chandler Harris, and published 25 such works in Alabama Sketches (1902).Williams, p. 137 During interviews in his later years, he rarely referred to his attempts at prose and considered himself first and foremost a poet. At his death, however, he left behind four unfinished novels. A Birmingham, Alabama newspaper reported on his death by noting, \\"Peck was not a great poet. But he was a wholesome influence upon Alabama letters.\\"Williams, p. 138 Published works *Cap and Bells (1886)Gardner, Martin (ed.) (1995) Famous Poems from Bygone Days.

It was optimized for short-haul missions only, carrying cargo to locations for loading onto ships, trains or pipelines. Depending on the role, the design was nicknamed \\"Brute Lifter\\" or \\"Flying Pipeline\\". The basic design had a rectangular wing spanning almost , was powered by 12 Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines, and had 56 wheels in the main landing gear. A total of of cargo was carried in two under-wing pods and fuselage. The RC-1 would have been roughly twice the size and mass of the Antonov An-225 Mriya, the largest aircraft built, but would have carried about five times the payload. The RC-1 was designed in the early 1970s. The rapid increase in jet fuel prices after 1973 caused the project to become uneconomical. History =Early concepts= The RC-1 concept traces its history to an informal question asked of Boeing engineer Marvin Taylor. A friend who worked in the oil exploration business asked Taylor about the possibility of airlifting crude oil out of the newly discovered Alaska North Slope fields to refineries in the south. Taylor's back-of-the-envelope calculations demonstrated such a system would cost many times the market price of the oil. A series of injunctions against the Trans- Alaska Pipeline System imposed in April 1970 created the possibility that the oil from these fields would be stranded. Among a variety of potential solutions being offered, Boeing started a much more serious evaluation of the airlift concept. It was noticed early on that two important factors had not been fully considered earlier. One was that an aircraft flying from Alaska to California would be flying right over some of the best developed shipping lanes available. By offloading as early as possible to some other mode of transport‚Äîtankers or pipelines‚Äîthe amount of fuel burned would be greatly reduced. More importantly, this freed the aircraft to return to for another load more rapidly than if it flew all the way to California, meaning that a single aircraft could deliver more cargo in a given time. This had been noticed in the earlier studies, but the full impact had not been appreciated. This led naturally to the second issue, involving the sortie rate of the aircraft. In the initial calculations they had assumed similar sortie rates as commercial aircraft like the Boeing 747, flying long multi-hour flights from the oil fields in Alaska to California. However, the sortie rates of commercial aircraft are based on customer preferences on what times they want to fly, not the actual ability of the aircraft. Assuming much shorter routes and 24-hour operation, sortie rates on the order of 18 to 20 flights a day seemed possible. This greatly reduced the number of aircraft that were needed to provide any particular level of service. With these two concepts, it appeared that existing cargo conversions of aircraft like the 747 would result in airlift prices just below the current price of crude. This was not particularly practical, but given the great improvements over initial concepts, further studies followed. The first of these considered adaptations of the existing 747F freighters, removing the jet fuel from the wings due to the short range (relying instead on tanks in the fuselage and tail). With the load on the wings reduced, cargo could be carried along the spans or in the wing tanks. With these changes, in mid-summer 1970 Boeing presented a plan that could deliver oil for $1.50 to $2.00 a barrel. The oil companies were not interested. At the time, a barrel sold for about $3.\\"US Crude Oil First Purchase Price.\\" EIA, 1 November 2013. =Great Plains= In 1970 Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau started the Great Plains Project to study economic development of the Canadian west and north. The Project was tasked with considering only \\"big picture\\" developments, ones that were just within the capabilities of existing technology. As part of this project, the known mineral and potential oil and gas deposits in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago were considered for development. Shipping the products proved to be an enormous problem; the sea lanes were ice-free for only a few months a year, and building a railhead to even the closest suitable shore point would still require hundreds of miles of rail to be laid over tundra. A pipeline would have to cross both land and water, and was likewise considered extremely difficult to build. The Project team became aware of Boeing's work with the 747F, and contacted them about the possibility of using the same basic system to haul ore instead of oil. This provided the impetus to develop the ultimate RC-1 concept. To carry ore, which couldn't simply be pumped into tanks in the aircraft, the team started considering using drop-off pods that would be loaded \\"offline\\" at the sides of the airports. The pods would then be hauled to the aircraft for flight to a railhead. There, they would be dropped off and emptied onto trains while the aircraft flew the return flight, taking a set of now-emptied pods from a previous aircraft with it. As they explored the concept, it became clear that the offline loading greatly improved turnaround times for any cargo, including oil. Further, custom pods allowed them to ship any sort of cargo on the same aircraft. This led to the question as to where these pods should be located. An obvious solution would be to load them into the aircraft's huge fuselage. However, this would require the nose or tail to open, adding some complexity. It was noticed early on that it could be loaded much faster if the cargo was placed under the wings instead; the cargo containers could be driven up to either side of the aircraft at the same time. As soon as this was considered another major advantage became clear; by locating the pods closer to the landing gear, the total amount of cargo that could be carried was dramatically increased. This allowed the gear to be placed on the wings as on traditional designs, instead of the complex fuselage-mounted systems normally found on heavy lifters. This led to a further modification by placing two sets of gear on either side of each cargo pod, for a total of eight sets of main landing gear, further spreading out the loads. Using this many landing gear on a swept wing would produce considerable problems when the aircraft tried to turn on the ground. It was possible to use steerable landing gear legs for this, but only at the cost of added complexity. An easier solution was to simply use a straight wing so the landing gear were in a line. However, this would limit the design to slower speeds below about Mach 0.7 (see wave drag). This was perfectly acceptable for short-haul role, where the cruise times were so short that added speed would have little actual effect on round-trip times. By limiting themselves to speeds not much greater than propeller transports, the engineers were free to select a wing designed solely for low-speed high-lift performance. The result looked much more like the wing from a 1930s airliner than a modern jet aircraft. A final consideration, especially for the Great Plains Project, was the use of methane for fuel instead of jet fuel. Due to aerodynamic control considerations, the fuselage of the RC-1 had to be very large, yet carried almost nothing. This left enormous room for fuel tankage, and the use of methane, hydrogen, or other lightweight fuels was a natural consideration. As the Canadian group was also interested in using the RC-1 to haul liquified natural gas, using this as the fuel for the aircraft (natural gas is mostly methane) was an obvious choice. Methane burns much cleaner than jet fuel, and would greatly extend the engine life while also reducing the need for maintenance. It would also eliminate the need to fly fuel to the northern sites, they could simply generate their fuel in-place. In order to match the capacity and economics of a oil pipeline, the same being considered for the Alaska Pipeline and Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, the system required 50 aircraft (about 15 of those being spares) each carrying about 8,000 barrels of oil and flying 24 hours a day.Wahl, Paul. \\"What Has 56 wheels and flies? The world's largest aircraft.\\" Popular Science, October 1972, pp. 97, 132. The aircraft were estimated to cost $72 million each (about $ today), and fly for between 1 and 1¬Ω cents per ton-mile.\\"Super-jumbo planes eyed for shipping oil, gas.\\" Eugene Register-Guard, 18 September 1972. The Project was delighted by the RC-1 proposal, and several well-publicized stories about it followed. They were particularly interested in the way that it allowed them to have market flexibility; the RC-1 could reach pipelines in Cochrane, Ontario, any one of the existing pipe heads in Alberta, or any point between. If market demands changed, they could simply ship the gas to a different location, thereby avoiding the cycling of prices seen between the various points on the pipeline network. The Project also studied tankers and freighters able to drive the Arctic Ocean and Hudson's Bay year-round, and a new northern deepwater port to support these ships, referred to as \\"Northport\\". This led to considerable concern in the town of Churchill, Manitoba, at that time the only major port on Hudson's Bay. Churchill was connected south by the Hudson Bay Railway, but its port was too shallow to handle the deep-hulled icebreakers being considered. Northport, considered at either Chesterfield Inlet or even Repulse Bay, would have connected to Churchill via a new rail line, but it would also replace Churchill as a useful commercial port. The RC-1 would have eased these concerns; building an airport at Churchill was far less expensive than a new port and railway to connect it. The Project also considered unrelated projects, including huge fish farms in the prairies fed from enormous underground warm-water aquifers, and year-round \\"vegetable factories\\" in the Arctic. =End of the design= With these changes in place, Boeing was once again ready to present the new RC-1 design to the developers of the Prudhoe Bay oil fields. By this time several successful attempts had been made by the to force transit of the Northwest Passage in 1969 and 1970, but the \\"icebreaker tanker\\" was considered too risky to consider for continuous operations. In 1972 Boeing was able to offer the RC-1 as a replacement, allowing trans-shipment to any suitable port, railhead or pipeline.Naske, Claus and Herman Slotnick. \\"Alaska: A History of the 49th State.\\" University of Oklahoma Press, 1987, p. 256. In these latest studies, costs were between 86 cents and $1.02 per barrel. By this point Boeing had invested about $500,000 of their own money in the RC-1 study series. With interest from both Canada and the US, the Great Plains Project was confident they would be able to gather a group of companies willing to fund the $15 million required for a full design study. History, in the form of the 1973 oil crisis, ended these plans. The approximate doubling of jet fuel prices during the period from 1973 to 1974\\"Fuel and air transport.\\" Air Transport Department, Cranfield University, p. 6. rendered the RC-1 no longer competitive with a pipeline. No further work on the design appears to have been carried out. The Alaskan fields would ultimately be served by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. Design The RC-1 was primarily intended for short-haul flights, between , with rapid turnaround at the ends. This reduced the need for high cruising speeds. The low-speed concept allowed the design to dispense with several features normally found on jet aircraft, notably the sweptback wing. By using a conventional rectangular wing, the high-speed drag was greatly increased (see wave drag) but the low-speed lift was likewise greatly increased. Further, the rectangular planform allowed the twin wing spars to be single pieces, and all of the engines, landing gear and cargo could be attached directly to the spar. With a swept wing this would place considerable torque loads on the point where the wings met the fuselage. In most other aspects the design was relatively similar to other cargo aircraft of the era. The fuselage was large and roughly the size of a wide-body airliner (although relative to the length, it appeared to be a narrow-body design), with a T-tail at the end. The dozen engines were distributed evenly along the wings, with each side having four engines on the outer sections, and two between the cargo pods and fuselage. To lower runway loads, the aircraft used a massive landing gear arrangement with 56 wheels. The majority of the wheels were located on eight legs with six wheels each, four to a side spread along the underside of the wings to distribute the loads. The nose gear used a single leg with eight wheels, itself the size of a 747's main gear. Fully deployed, the gear required a wide runway, but if the aircraft was unloaded, the outer gear could be raised to allow landings on existing commercial runways. This was useful for ferrying and service flights. Cargo was carried in wing-mounted pods, each consisting of a cylinder in diameter and about the same length as a semi- trailer. This size was selected to allow them to carry standard cargo containers in a 2-by-2 arrangement, the same as the 747F. Each aircraft would carry four such pods, two on either side, one each in front and behind the two spars. The cylinders were mated to aerodynamic fairings while being prepared on the ground, depending on whether they were going to be on the front or rear of the wing. The wing itself had a \\"plug\\" section that locked on onto the pods. When combined on the wing the result was a single streamlined pod about long, about the same length as a 707. The pods could carry approximately 2,000 barrels of oil or of other cargo. Loading the pods was accomplished on a set of parallel railway tracks, two tracks on either side of the aircraft. The front and back halves of the pods were positioned at the end of the tracks on loaders, with the pods below the line of the wings. The aircraft would taxi into position between the rails, and the loaders would then raise the pods into position for locking onto the spars. They would then drive towards the aircraft for mating. To achieve the required sortie rate needed to make the \\"flying pipeline\\" concept work, Boeing designed an airport around the aircraft. This featured three parallel runways that would operate at the same time. Aircraft landed on the two outer runways, and then taxied along large operational aprons at either end of the runways. Here they dropped their cargo pods and picked up empty ones for the return flight. Two such transfer stations were located at either end, in order to maintain the required sortie rate. The aircraft weight was so reduced after unloading that a downwind takeoff was trivially accomplished, saving the time and fuel needed to taxi to the upwind end of the middle runway. In cases of very high winds, the center runway would be used as a taxiway to return the aircraft to the ends of the two outer runways for takeoff. This would reduce sortie rates. Likewise, at the loading end of the route, the aircraft would land downwind, load, and takeoff upwind. Empty weight was , almost twice that of the Antonov An-225, the largest and heaviest aircraft to be built, at .Goebel, Greg. \\"The Antonov Giants: An-22, An-124, & An-225: Antonov An-225 Mriya (\\"Cossack).\\" Air Vectors, 13 September 2001.

However, whilst in her last year as an undergraduate, she took a temporary job at the University of Copenhagen Medical School, she taught medical students about the structure and function of human organs, which, combined with her undergraduate studies in human embryology, sparked an interest in the \\"basic problems in animal development.\\" She began her graduate studies in 1974 at the University of Colorado at Boulder. There, she worked with molecular biologist David Hirsh who was studying the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Kimble then moved to the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, where she spent four years as a postdoctoral fellow working with Sir John Sulston on the control of organogenesis. During the course of her work, Kimble found a special somatic cell at the tip of the gonad which tells nearby germ cells - reproductive cells - how to divide. When she destroyed the distal tip cell, germ cells stopped dividing. When she moved the somatic cell to a different place, germ cells started dividing in that new location. This was the first time a single cell with such an oversight function had been identified. Early career Kimble moved to the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1983 where she took up an assistant professorship position.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the Deanery of Wirral, South, the archdeaconry of Chester, and the diocese of Chester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History All Saints was built in 1867‚Äì68, and paid for by Joseph Hirst. It was designed by the Huddersfield architects John Kirk and Sons. Joseph Hirst was a woollen mill owner from Wilshaw near Huddersfield, whose wife came from Chester, and he had bought a house near Thornton Hough as a place to recuperate from his business stresses. He bought land in the village to build the church for ¬£600, and laid its foundation stone in March 1867. The cost of the church, excluding the cost of the land, amounted to about ¬£8,500 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). It was consecrated on 5 May 1868 by the Rt Revd William Jacobson, bishop of Chester. In addition to paying for the building of the church, Hirst also paid for the vicarage, the school, and the school house. In addition he paid for a school and school house at Raby, a village nearby. In the early 20th century a vestry was added by Jonathan Simpson. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in rock- faced red sandstone with dressings in lighter stone. It is roofed in slate with a red tile ridge. Its architectural style is Geometrical, and it has a cruciform plan. The church consists of a four-bay nave with a northwest porch, north and south transepts, a chancel with a north organ loft and a south vestry, and a southwest tower with a broach spire. The tower has angle buttresses, two-light windows and clock faces. There is a total of five clock faces, with an additional higher one on the south side because Hirst could not see the lower face from his house. At the top of the tower is a cornice with pinnacles, and two tiers of lucarnes on the spire. The spire rises to a height of Along the sides of the church is a Lombard frieze, buttresses, and two- light windows containing Geometrical tracery. The west window has five lights. In the transepts are three-light windows with a spherical triangle window above. The chancel has a three-light east window, and two-light windows along the sides. There is a lancet window in the organ loft, and a three-light window in the vestry. =Interior= Inside the church the font and reredos are in Caen stone, they were both made by T. Ruddock, and they depict biblical scenes. The stained glass includes the east window of 1868 by Clayton and Bell. In the south transept is a window by H. G. Hiller dated 1912, which depicts Saint Michael and angels. The west window is by an unknown artist, it is a war memorial dating from about 1920, and again it depicts Saint Michael. Elsewhere there are windows by Powell's, and by A. R. Fisher (1978), William Davies (1997), and Petri Anderson (2003). In the south transept is an ornate Gothic monument to Joseph Hirst who died in 1874. The original pipe organ was made by Gray and Davison. This was replaced in 1912 by a two-manual organ by Norman and Beard. It was revoiced in 1985 by George Sixsmith.

Trappe was appointed a project leader in forest mycology at the Corvallis station in 1965 and he stayed in that position until his 'retirement' in 1996. When he arrived at Corvallis, one of the most important collections of hypogeous fungi in North America was in care of the retiring Professor Helen Margaret Gilkey who bequeathed it to Trappe, a windfall which aided his future research immensely. During his tenure at Corvallis he participated in and eventually became a trustee of the North American Truffling Society which has worked to further collaboration among hobbyists and researchers on in the field of hypogeous fungi, travelled to Torino to study truffle specimens, hosted visiting scholars from over 20 countries and mentored many prominent mycologists in their own right. =Continuing Work= Despite having retired, Trappe remained as a research professor with the Department of Forest Science at Corvallis for 10 years before technically retiring in 1996. he has remained active well after his second retirement. Since 1999 he has been sojourning to Australia for 4‚Äì5 months a year to work on truffle taxonomy with the Australian Government.James M. Trappe, personal webpage In 2007 he published a book on North American truffle identification with his son and published a second volume on the ecological status of truffles with Chris Maser and Andrew W. Claridge in 2008. Trappe has continued to publish, with papers published as recently as 2013 regarding his work on Australian truffle diversity.

A detachment served in the Second Boer War and two full battalions fought in World War I, receiving the surrender of Jerusalem and crossing the Jordan among other exploits. During World War II the regiment operated as a searchlight unit and briefly as an infantry battalion, before becoming an anti-aircraft regiment in the postwar years. Origin The invasion scare of 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Force and huge enthusiasm for joining Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). However, in some areas such as London and its suburbs, the number of proposed units outstripped the available recruits, and the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex, the Marquis of Salisbury, tried to rationalise them into a smaller number of better-supported RVCs. In the Parish of St Pancras, two leading Parliamentary spokesmen for the Volunteer movement proposed competing units: Lord Elcho (MP for Haddingtonshire) wanted to form the 'Euston Road Rifles', while Lord Enfield (MP for Middlesex) was organising the 'North Middlesex' RVC. Salisbury merged the two into the 29th (North Middlesex) Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps under Enfield's command. (Elcho was already a very active commanding officer of the London Scottish RVC; Enfield also held the ceremonial position of Honorary Colonel of the 2nd or Edmonton Royal Rifle Regiment of Middlesex Militia.) The first commissions for officers of the 29th Middlesex were issued on 28 February 1860.Frederick, p. 215.19th Londons at Regiments.orgBeckett, pp. 45, 48, 154, 269, 275, 299.Burke's Peerage: 'Earl of Strafford'. The uniform was grey with scarlet facings and a grey fur Busby with a plume.Ernest F. Rashbrook, 'The Rifle Volunteers of Camden', Camden History Review, No 3, 1975. The new unit had its first headquarters at Kent Lodge in Park Village East, near Regent's Park, and later had a drill hall in Pratt Street, Camden Town. It was successful in attracting working-class recruits from the railway yards and densely populated areas of Camden Town, Kentish Town and Somers Town north of Euston Road.Eames, p. 1. In 1880, following mergers and disbandments of less successful units, the 29th Middlesex was renumbered 17th. The following year it became the 4th Volunteer Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment (3rd Volunteer Battalion from 1892), but retained its title of 17th (North Middlesex) RVC. Boer War The battalion sent a Service Company of volunteers to South Africa to serve alongside the Regulars of the 2nd Battalion Middlesex Regiment in the Second Boer War and as a result received its first Battle Honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02. Four of these volunteers died on service and are commemorated by a plaque now in St Pancras Parish Church.UKNIWM Ref 61743 Territorial Force Under the Haldane Reforms, the former Volunteers were subsumed into the Territorial Force in 1908. The 17th Middlesex became the 19th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (St Pancras) (TF) and formed part of 5th London Brigade in the 2nd London Division. Its new headquarters and drill hall was at 76 Camden High Street.Frederick, pp. 149‚Äì50.James, pp. 114‚Äì6.Maude, Appendices C, D, F. World War I The outbreak of war on 4 August saw the men of the 19th Londons at Perham Down on Salisbury Plain, where they had just arrived for their annual training camp with the rest of 2nd London Division. They were immediately recalled to Camden to complete their mobilisation and by mid- August the battalion had reached its war station at Hatfield, Hertfordshire.Maude, pp. 2‚Äì3.Becke, Part 2a, pp. 69‚Äì75.London Regiment at Long, Long Trail The County of London Territorial Force Association began raising 'Second Line' battalions, which led to the formation of a duplicate 2/19th London battalion; consequently the existing battalion was prefixed 1/19th. Subsequently, a reserve or 'Third Line' battalion (3/19th) was organised to supply drafts to the other two battalions.Maude, p. 287.Eames, p. 2.Becke, Part 2b, pp. 25‚Äì30.London Regiment at Regimental Warpath 1/19th Londons In October 1914, 2nd London Division was selected for service on the Western Front and progressive training was carried out through the winter. Men who had volunteered for Home Service only were transferred to the 2/19th Battalion. 5th London Bde was the leading element of the division to land in France on 9/10 March 1915. In May the division (already known in France simply as 'The London Division' to distinguish it from the Regular Army 2nd Division) took its place in the line and was designated 47th (1/2nd London) Division, with the brigades numbered consecutively: 5th London became 141st (1/5th London) Brigade. The 1/19th served in this brigade throughout the war.Maude, pp. 11‚Äì19.47th Division at Long, Long Trail47 Division at Regimental Warpath =1915= Loos, 25 September 1915. During 1915 the battalion was engaged in the following operations:Maude, Appendix E. * Battle of Festubert 24‚Äì27 May * Battle of Loos 25 September‚Äì1 October At the Battle of Loos the 1/19th formed part of the second wave attacking the southern side of Loos village itself. Its CO, Lt-Col Collison-Morley, was killed at the head of the battalion soon after leaving the trenches, and the 1/19th encountered stiff opposition in Loos cemetery before pushing on to clear houses and cellars in the village. It ended the day at its final objective, the coal-mine winding gear known as 'Tower Bridge'. 1/19th suffered the heaviest casualties in 47th Division that day (14 officers and 372 other ranks).Maude, pp. 301.Cherry, pp. 109‚Äì14, 120‚Äì22. * Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt 13‚Äì19 October =1916= During 1916 the battalion was engaged in the following operations: * Vimy Ridge ‚Äì the units of 47th Division were involved in frequent crater-fighting in this sector from April to July 1916, including the major German attack on 21 May.Maude, pp. 50‚Äì60. * Battle of the Somme: ** Battle of Flers-Courcelette 15‚Äì19 September ** Capture of High Wood 15 September ‚Äì the 1/19th were in the second wave of the attack, but got caught up in the confused fighting. Their CO, Lt-Col A.P. Hamilton, assembled all the available men and went up into the wood to try to restore order, but was killed. High Wood, which had held up the British for two months, was finally taken, but casualties were so heavy that 141 Bde had to be reorganised into a composite battalion.Maude, pp. 64‚Äì5. ** Battle of the Transloy Ridges 1‚Äì9 October ** Capture of Eaucourt l'Abbaye 1‚Äì3 October ** Attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt 7‚Äì8 October =1917= 47th Division moved into the Hill 60 sector of the Ypres Salient in October 1916 and took part in regular raids and crater fighting for a number of months.Maude, pp. 80‚Äì96. It then took part in the following operations: * Battle of Messines ‚Äì in the weeks leading up to the battle, 141 Bde held the divisional front and carried out preparations for the attacks, including digging new trenches and establishing ration and ammunition dumps. For the attack on 7 June it was in support, moving up to relieve 142 Bde two days later.Maude, pp. 97‚Äì103. A patrol of 1/19th Londons moves through a shattered village near Ypres, 27 August 1917 * 3rd Battle of Ypres ‚Äì 47th Division was not directly involved in the offensive, being in reserve during the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July‚Äì2 August) and spending two periods holding the line (18 August‚Äì2 September and 8‚Äì17 September), described as 'among the most unpleasant in its experience'.Maude, pp. 104‚Äì11, 240. * Battle of Cambrai ‚Äì 141 Bde took over the recently captured Bourlon Wood on 29 November in time to be hit by the German counter-attack the following morning. 1/19th Londons were badly affected by the enemy bombardment, particularly by gas shells. Out of 15 officers and over 600 men of the battalion who took up position in the wood, only 5 officers and 65 other ranks remained in the line by the end of the day, and many of these were later evacuated to hospital suffering from the effects of gas.Maude, pp. 123‚Äì6, 133. =1918= By early 1918 the British Army was suffering a severe manpower shortage and a number of battalions were disbanded to bring others up to strength. In February the 1/19th received a large draft of 14 officers and 375 men from A, B and D Companies 1/7th Londons in 140th (4th London) Brigade.Planck, pp.140‚Äì2, 183.Maude, p. 145. When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March, 47th Division had just relieved another formation in the line and were holding the right flank of Third Army. The main blow fell on Fifth Army to the south, but the Londoners were heavily bombarded and later in the day the Germans attacked behind a smoke screen. 1/19th took part in the successful counter-attack to regain the positions lost. However, Fifth Army was collapsing and 47th Division, with its flank open, was obliged to fall back on successive lines of half-dug trenches. The retirement, with rearguards contesting the German advance throughout, went on for six days and casualties were heavy. By the end, the remnants of 1/19th and 1/20th Londons were formed into a composite battalion.Maude, pp. 149‚Äì67. The Germans attempted to renew the offensive on 5 April. By now 47th Division had reorganised. Most of 1/19th was with 141 Bde in divisional reserve, but one company was in the front line still attached to 1/20th. The attack was made after an intense bombardment, and fighting went on all day, with reserves fed in progressively. The Germans made some gains, but the line held. 47th Division was relieved that night.Maude, pp. 167‚Äì71. 47th Division now had three quiet months, resting and then holding a quiet sector of the line, which gave the battalions time to absorb the hundreds of 18-year-old recruits they were sent to fill up their ranks. It was then engaged in the following operations: * Battle of Albert 22‚Äì23 August ‚Äì The division joined the Allied counter-offensive in this battle. 141 Brigade began their advance at 0445, and gained their objective with little resistance, but in the morning mist and battle smoke the battalions began to consolidate a little short of the intended line; the follow-up units suffered heavily.Maude, pp. 187‚Äì9. * 2nd Battle of Bapaume 31 August‚Äì3 September ‚Äì 141 Bde advanced behind a creeping barrage at 0530, gained all the ground required, and continued to advance the following day. A new dawn attack on 5 September suffered a check, so it was successfully repeated under cover of a barrage and a thunderstorm at 1900, followed by a further push on 6 September.Maude, pp. 193‚Äì4. After a further period of rest, 47th Division was preparing for a move to the Italian Front when it was instead ordered to take part in the final operations on the Western Front. On 1 October 141 Bde was hurried forward to keep in touch with the retreating Germans. Like the rest of the brigade, 1/19th Bn was now very weak, and further casualties were suffered from German rearguards, but the brigade took Aubers Ridge, scene of previous costly attacks during the war. The pursuit continued, until on 4 October the 1/19th secured a position on the strongly-held Armentieres-Wavrin railway embankment. The advance was resumed on 16 October, 1/19th coming upon Fort d'Englos, one of the string of forts encircling Lille. On 28 October the division accompanied Third Army's commander, Sir William Birdwood on his ceremonial entry into Lille. 141 Brigade resumed its place in the Line on 31 October and took up positions along the River Schelde. The river was crossed on 9 November, and the Armistice with Germany on 11 November found the battalions of 141 Bde administering the liberated city of Tournai.Maude, pp. 199‚Äì206. =1919= Demobilisation of 47 Division began in early 1919. By March the units had been reduced to cadres, and these left for England in May.Maude, pp.207‚Äì12. =Commanding Officers= The following officers commanded 1/19th Londons during World War I:Maude, Appendix D. * Lt-Col P.T. Westmorland, CMG, DSO, to 2 June 1915 * Lt-Col H. Collison-Morley, killed in action 25 September 1915 * Lt-Col A.P. Hamilton, MC, killed in action 15 September 1916 * Major C.H. Fair, DSO * Lt-Col J.G. Stokes, DSO, MC * Lt-Col E.J. Collett * Lt-Col R.S.I. Friend, DSO * Maj J.J. Sheppard, DSO, MC, to May 1918 * Lt-Col H. De L. Fergusson, DSO, to August 1918 * Maj J.J. Sheppard, DSO, MC, to September 1918 * Lt-Col Hutchisson, to December 1918 * Maj C.J. Bantick, until demobilisation 2/19th Londons In the enthusiasm of August 1914, it took only a fortnight to recruit the 2/19th battalion to full strength. One whole company was enlisted from the Railway Clearing House and the rest of the battalion from other local businesses and organisations such as London Zoo in Regent's Park. Early training was undertaken in civilian clothes, parading in the drill hall and then marching to Regent's Park for training. The first commanding officer was Lt-Col E.J. Christie, a believer in singing on the march, and the battalion soon became known as 'Christie's Minstrels'. In October the battalion absorbed the unfit and Home Service men of 1/19th, but lost some of its best recruits in exchange. The Home Service men were later passed on to the 3/19th (Reserve) Battalion.Eames, pp. 1‚Äì8. The organisation of the Second Line Territorials was a duplicate of the First Line, so that 2/19th Londons was assigned to 2/5th London Brigade in 2/2nd London Division. At the end of 1915, these were redesignated 180th (2/5th London) Brigade and 60th (2/2nd London) Division respectively, and sent to Sutton Veney on Salisbury Plain for intensive training prior to going overseas. By the time the 2/19th Battalion arrived at Salisbury Plain in January 1916, it was much depleted by the drafts it had sent to the 1/19th in France. It was brought up to strength by a draft from the Middlesex Regiment, the return of the Home Service men from 3/19th (the passage of the Military Service Act in January 1916 made them liable for overseas service), and by a draft of 250 volunteers from the Royal Army Medical Corps (who were untrained in infantry work).Eames, pp. 14‚Äì8. =Western Front= 2/19th Battalion landed in France on 25 June 1916. After a period of familiarisation alongside the experienced 1/5th Seaforth Highlanders, the battalion took over a section of the line on Vimy Ridge. Over succeeding weeks the 2/19th alternated in the line, in support and in reserve with the 2/17th Londons.Eames, pp. 20‚Äì30. The 60th Division adopted coloured flashes painted on each side of the steel helmet to aid recognition: 180 Bde adopted a triangle, which was blue in the case of the 2/19th Bn.Elliot, p. 26. During the summer the battalion was engaged in occasional crater-fighting and trench-raiding. After five months in the line, it had suffered around 200 casualties, 40 of them fatal.Eames, pp. 31‚Äì41. =Salonika= On 1 November, 60th Division was ordered to prepare to move to the Macedonian front, and the battalion embarked at Marseille on 25 November and landed at Salonika on 1 December. It began the march north on 18 December and went into the line on Christmas Eve.Eames, pp. 40‚Äì7 The battalion was peripherally involved in the Battle of Doiran 24‚Äì5 April and 8‚Äì9 May 1917.Eames, pp. 55‚Äì7. =Palestine= The 60th Division was next transferred to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force for the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The 2/19th left Lake Doiran on 1 June and marched back to Salonika where it embarked on 10 June. After a period of training and acclimatisation in the Canal Zone, the battalion moved up to the front in July.Eames, pp. 57‚Äì66. On 31 October the battalion was with 180th Brigade in divisional reserve for the Battle of Beersheba, but the attack was so successful that it never came into action.Eames, p. 78. On 6 November the 2/19th was one of the attacking battalions that captured the Kauwukah position during the Battle of Hareira and Sheria. The Sheria position remaining untaken, the brigade attacked again the following day, and the 2/19th suffered heavy casualties, the acting commanding officer, Major A.W. Gray, being killed.Eames, pp. 79‚Äì83. Nebi Samwil mosque before the battle The pursuit through the Judaean Hills saw the battalion engaged at the Battle of Mughar Ridge and by 25 November it took over the Nebi Samwil position a few miles from Jerusalem.Bullock, p. 90. This position had been captured after heavy fighting by British and Indian troops. On 27 November the Turks opened a heavy bombardment on the mosque that crowned the hill, which was held by D Company of 2/19th. This was followed by wave after wave of attacks, but the company, without significant artillery support, drove them all back, causing several hundred casualties.Eames, pp. 83‚Äì91. During the night of 7/8 December the 2/19th began the attack on Jerusalem by taking the Deir Yesin position. After a holdup in daylight, the battalion renewed the attack in the afternoon. The following morning, the Turks had retreated. Sergeants Hurcomb and Sedgewick went out to reconnoitre and met the Mayor of Jerusalem and a party of civilians who offered them the keys of the abandoned city. After the capture of Jerusalem, the 2/19th, reduced to some 300 men, went into billets in the city. On 11 December it provided a guard of honour for General Allenby's ceremonial entry into the city.Eames, pp. 94‚Äì8, 99‚Äì101, 107‚Äì8.Bullock, pp. 94‚Äì5. Sergeants Hurcomb (right) and Sedgewick (left) with the Mayor of Jerusalem and his delegation Monument to the surrender of Jerusalem to the 60th London Division. The Turkish counter-attack on Jerusalem began on 27 December. When 180th Brigade relieved the defenders who had beaten off the initial Turkish attacks, it went over to the offensive, with 2/19th capturing the slopes of Shab Saleh.Eames, pp. 118‚Äì21. After a pause, Allenby resumed his advance and the 2/19th took part in the capture of Jericho on 19‚Äì21 February 1918, storming Talat ed Dumm.Eames, pp. 126‚Äì9. The battalion took part in the 1st and 2nd Trans-Jordan raids of 21 March‚Äì2 April and 30 April‚Äì4 May. On the first occasion (the Battle of Hijla) the leading elements of the 2/19th struggled across the river by swimming and rafting during the night of 21/22 March while other battalions were driven back. Once a pontoon bridge had been completed and reinforcements arrived, the advance continued in the afternoon of 22 March with artillery support. But the next position could not be taken and the troops were pinned down until nightfall, the 2/19th suffering heavy casualties. A second night attack succeeded in extending the bridgehead. The battalion remained in reserve during the subsequent attack on Amman, and covered the retirement of the raiding force to the bridgehead.Eames, pp. 132‚Äì41. The pontoon bridge across the Jordan In the 2nd Transjordan raid, the 2/19th attacked out of the Jordan bridgehead. The night attack on 29/30 April became bogged down with heavy casualties against strengthened Turkish positions. The leading companies held out during the daylight hours until other units outflanked the position. The battalion then held the outpost line until the raiders returned on 4 May.Eames, pp. 142‚Äì7. In the summer of 1918 many units from 60th Division were transferred to the Western Front and the division was converted to the Indian establishment. 2/19th Londons remained, however, as the sole British battalion in 180th Bde, alongside three newly recruited Indian Army units.Eames, pp. 148‚Äì9 The division was intensively trained for its part in the forthcoming Megiddo offensive.Eames, p. 153. At Zero hour on 19 September 1918, the Indian battalions of 180th Bde attacked, and had taken all their objectives by 05.40. The 2/19th Londons then passed through, forced the passage of the shallow Nahr el Faliq with some losses, and established a bridgehead on the far side by 07.20. 181st Brigade followed through and continued the attack. The division had accomplished all its tasks and played a major part in the final defeat of the Turkish army in Palestine.Eames, pp. 153‚Äì5. This set-piece battle is known as the Battle of Sharon. The pursuit of the retreating Turks was so rapid that the infantry formations were left behind, and 2/19th Londons, together with the rest of 60th Division, was left to collect prisoners and secure captured stores along the line of advance until the Armistice with the Turks was signed on 30 October 1918.Eames, pp. 156‚Äì7. =1919‚Äì20= The 2/19th Londons spent the New Year at Alexandria, where it was required to keep order among the Egyptian population. In March 1919 it embarked for Lebanon, from where it was sent to Homs in Syria. On 24 March the battalion was amalgamated with 2nd Battalion Leicestershire Regiment, but retained its identity, the HQ of 2nd Leicesters returning to the UK. In April the composite battalion moved to Aleppo to keep order during the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. Parties of the battalion had already been sent home for demobilisation, and in October 1919 a large draft of men arrived from the Suffolk Regiment to maintain numbers. The battalion was disbanded on 21 January 1920 in Egypt.Eames, pp. 157‚Äì8. =Commanding Officers= The following officers commanded 2/19th Londons:Eames, pp. 159‚Äì60. * Lt-Col E.J. Christie, from first raising * Lt-Col D.C. Sword, DSO, from training on Salisbury Plain to Fall of Jerusalem; evacuated sick 2 January 1918 * Maj A.J. Gray (Royal Scots), acting during Battle of Hareira and Sheria, killed in action 7 November 1917 * Maj W.M. Craddock, DSO, (2/20th Londons), during Trans-Jordan raids * Lt-Col A.E. Norton, DSO, (2/18th Londons), from reorganisation during summer 1918 to disbandment * Maj C.S. Williamson, acting during final advance in Palestine 3/19th Londons The Third-Line battalion was formed on 25 March 1915, when it went into camp in Richmond Park. Subordinate to the 2nd London Reserve Group (later Brigade), it trained drafts for the First and Second Line battalions and never left the UK. In January 1916 it moved to Winchester. On 8 April 1916 it was redesignated 19th (Reserve) Battalion, London Regiment. It later moved to Chisledon in November 1917, and then Blackdown in March 1918 when it joined the 1st London Reserve Brigade. By October 1918 it was at Hunstanton, and it was disbanded on 11 June 1919, when it was probably at Shoreham-by-Sea.Training Battalions at Regimental Warpath Interwar On 16 February 1920, the 47th Division began to reform in the new Territorial Army, and by 1922 the battalion had fully reformed as the 19th London Regiment (St Pancras) (TA) in 141 (5th London) Bde. (The London Regiment had disappeared as a separate entity during World War I, and its battalions were now designated as 'Regiments' within their previous parent regiment ‚Äì the Middlesex Regiment in the case of the 19th Londons.)Maude, p. 212. The regiment's 1930s drill hall at Albany Street Detail of the drill hall, showing changes of name painted over In 1935 the 47th Division was converted into the 1st Anti- Aircraft Division and 19th London was selected as one of its TA infantry battalions to be converted into searchlight units; on 1 November it was transferred to the Royal Engineers and redesignated 33rd (St Pancras) Anti- Aircraft Battalion RE (TA).Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 108, 113. Shortly afterwards it joined 29th (East Anglian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. At this point the battalion's HQ and two searchlight companies (Nos 332 and 333) were still based at 76 Camden High Street, but soon afterwards they moved to a new drill hall at Albany Street.Litchfield, pp. 170‚Äì1. 334 Company was newly raised by the Hertfordshire (rather than London) Territorial Association, which provided a new drill hall in St Albans Road, Barnet, opened in April 1938. The Hon Carol Fellowes was commissioned as major in command. Fellowes had served as a lieutenant in the Royal Norfolk Regiment in Mesopotamia in 1917‚Äì19.Sainsbury, Chapter 5.Burke's Peerage: 'Baron Ailwyn'. A further company (No 335) was based at another new drill hall at Tottenham High Road, but early in 1939 this company and establishment were transferred to a new 74th (Essex Fortress) AA Battalion.Frederick, pp. 858, 861, 865.Monthly Army List, January 1938, May 1939.Osborne, pp. 134‚Äì6.Farndale, Annex K, p. 316.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339. 33rd (St Pancras) Searchlight Regiment =Mobilisation= 33rd AA Battalion was mobilised on 26 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis and went to its war stations (334 Company to Baldock). It was stood down after 12 days. In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. 334 Company was deployed on 13 August. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, Anti-Aircraft Command was fully mobilised at its war stations:Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371.Mobilisation Orbat in 29 AA Brigade War Diary 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2250. 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth * Battalion HQ: The Limes, Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex * 332 AA Company: White Hart Hotel, Yeldham, Essex * 333 AA Company: Hargrave Park, Stansted * 334 AA Company: Colliers End, near Ware, Hertfordshire * Mobilisation stores at Buntingford, Hertfordshire The battalion mobilised in 29 AA Bde, but by the end of September 1939 had transferred to the new 40th Anti-Aircraft Brigade, covering East Anglia.AA Command at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LX, p. 378. 33rd AA Bn occupied S/L sites across Hertfordshire supporting the Debden Sector of No. 12 Group RAF, with battalion HQ at Stansted Mountfitchet. On 2 September, the day before war was declared, a colour party of the battalion returned to Albany Street and took the colours to St Pancras Town Hall for safekeeping. By mid- September, a detachment of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) had been attached to the battalion. On 1 July 1940, 33rd AA Bn came under the command of 6 AA Bde HQ, newly arrived at Debden after participating in the Norwegian Campaign. The brigade ordered the construction of a concrete pillbox at each S/L site and each company and section HQ ‚Äì a total of 75 in 33rd Bn's area. These were to provide defended patrol bases in the event of attack by enemy paratroops, and each site was joined by an infantry detachment and equipped with a wireless set. =The Blitz= On 1 August 1940 the RE 'Anti-Aircraft' (searchlight) battalions were transferred to the Royal Artillery, so the battalion became the 33rd (St Pancras) Searchlight Regiment RA (TA) and the AA companies and sections were redesignated searchlight batteries and troops.33 SL Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 On 10 August, Debden Sector was transferred from 12 Group to No. 11 Group RAF, so 6 AA Bde similarly transferred to 6th AA Division, responsible for the eastern approaches to London.6 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45 Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Farndale, Annex D, p. 257. 33rd S/L Rgt was largely unaffected by the Battle of Britain, but during the subsequent night Blitz on London it was active, particularly in cooperation with the night fighters of Debden Sector. The S/L layouts had been based on a spacing of 3500 yards, but due to equipment shortages this had been extended to 6000 yards by September 1940. The difficulty of illuminating night bombers led to a redistribution of S/Ls into clusters of three lights, one of which was the 'master light' that would eventually be equipped with searchlight control radar (SLC). This meant that the clusters had to be spaced 10,400 yards apart. 33rd S/L Regiment carried out the redistribution during December 1940 and January 1941, but did not begin to receive SLC equipment until October 1941.Routledge, pp. 388-9, 393, 396. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 230th S/L Training Rgt at Blandford Camp where it provided the basis for a new 520 S/L Bty formed on 14 November 1940. This battery later joined 85th S/L Rgt. In May 1941 the regiment was required to form a composite troop of six searchlights withdrawn from cluster sites to defend the new night-fighter base at RAF Hunsdon. By July this had become E Troop of 334 Bty. S/Ls were sometimes exposed as homing beacons for friendly aircraft. Once SLC equipment was widely available, 33rd S/L Rgt 'declustered' and reverted to deployment by single lights. =Mid-war= 6 AA Division formation badge worn 1941.Sainsbury, pp. 140, 142. By October 1941 the availability of SLC radar was sufficient to allow AA Command's S/Ls to be 'declustered' into single-light sites spaced at 10,400-yard intervals in 'Indicator Belts' along the coast and 'Killer Belts' at 6000-yard spacing inland to cooperate with the RAF's night fighters.Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì400. On 23 January 1942, 33rd S/L Rgt was increased by one battery, with 543 Bty joining from 89 S/L Rgt, though it was several months before it moved into the regimental area from Kent.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941 (15 January 1942 amendments), TNA file WO 212/80. 543rd S/L Bty had originally been formed in March 1941 from a cadre of 64th (1/6th Essex) S/L Rgt at 237 S/L Training Rgt at Holywood, Northern Ireland, with personnel mainly from Manchester. It had served with 89th S/L Rgt around Exeter and Plymouth during the latter part of the Blitz.89 S/L Rgt War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 166/3109. In January 1943, the growing ATS detachments allocated to AA units were reorganised: those with 33rd S/L Rgt became B Company, 6 AA Bde Group ATS, with a dedicated platoon to each S/L company. On 10 April 1943, 33rd S/L Rgt was ordered to change places with 73rd (Kent Fortress) S/L Rgt in 27th (Home Counties) AA Bde, taking over four areas of Kent under Biggin Hill Sector of 11 Group RAF, with Regimental HQ at Faversham. This area was under regular attack by Luftwaffe fighter- bombers, and the defensive armament of S/L positions was increased, with twin Vickers K machine gun mountings being added to the existing Lewis guns. The regiment's first Category 1 'kill' came on the night of 15/16 September when a site of 334 Bty at Kingsgate shot down a Heinkel He 111 with Lewis and Vickers guns, shared with the local Light AA gun unit. In September the regiment began to receive twin 0.5-inch Browning machine guns on power mountings. Between 21 January and 14 March 1944 the Luftwaffe carried out eleven night raids on London in the so-called 'Baby Blitz': two sites of 334 Bty shared another Cat 1 kill on 22/23 February. AA Radar No 2. However, by early 1944, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). 33rd S/L Rgt's contribution came through the disbandment of 543 Bty on 6 March and E Trp of 334 Bty; however E Trp of 346 Bty, 36th (Middlesex) S/L Rgt joined on 13 March as D/332 Trp.Routledge, p. 409. From September 1943 the regiment had been carrying out experiments on new combinations of S/Ls and SLC; in July1944 this was stepped up with the start of the V-1 flying bomb campaign against London, though Kent was on the fringe of the V-1s' route.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84. On 21 September, a USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress, attempting to reach the emergency airfield at RAF Manston, crashed onto one of the regiment's positions at Minster. Seven members of the detachment were commended for bravery in rescuing survivors from the burning wreck, and Lance- Bombardier Harkness and Gunner Bateman were later awarded the British Empire Medal. As 21st Army Group overran the V-1 launching sites in Northern France, the Luftwaffe began to launch them from aircraft over the North Sea. AA Command shifted units from Kent to deal with the threat, and in November 33 S/L Rgt had to take over some of these units' sites along the East Kent coast. 632nd (St Pancras) Regiment By the end of 1944, 21st Army Group was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2. At the same time the Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted. In January 1945 the War Office began to reorganise surplus anti-aircraft and coastal artillery regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties in North West Europe, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Routledge, p. 421. 27th (Home Counties) Anti-Aircraft Brigade was one of the HQs selected for conversion, becoming 303rd Infantry Brigade on 22 January 1945. Within the brigade, 33rd S/L Rgt was redesignated 632nd (St Pancras) Infantry Regiment RA the following day.Frederick, p. 882.Joslen, p. 399. The regiment reorganised as a garrison battalion at Eastbourne, with A Bty (HQ) and five rifle batteries designated B to E. Infantry training included a short period attached to 61st Infantry Division, when the regiment was reorganised again as conventional infantry battalion, with RHQ, HQ Bty, three rifle batteries (A‚ÄìC), and Support Bty. After VE-day, 303 Bde was sent to Norway in June 1945 following the liberation of that country (Operation Doomsday). 632 Regiment left Eastbourne on 5 June to embark from Leith for Norway, where it carried out duties until early December 1945. As a prewar TA unit, the regiment was not disbanded, but passed into 'suspended animation' on 31 January 1946 at Colchester. Postwar The regiment was reformed on 1 April 1947 in 52 AA Brigade of the postwar TA as 568th (St Pancras) Searchlight Regiment RA, changing its designation on 16 March 1949 to 568th (St Pancras) (Mixed) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment RA ('Mixed' indicating that it was composed partly of women of the Women's Royal Army Corps.)Frederick, p. 1023.564‚Äì591 Regiments at British Army units from 1947 on. While the regiment reformed at Albany St, the company at Barnet was not reformed, and its drill hall was taken over as HQ for 479th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy AA Rgt. 568th LAA/SL Regiment formed part of 54 (Thames & Medway) AA Bde.Litchfield, Appendix 5.30‚Äì66 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947. In 1955, 568th LAA/SL Rgt merged with the 512th (Finsbury Rifles) and 656th (Tower Hamlets) LAA Regiments, becoming Q (St Pancras) Battery of the resulting 512 LAA Regiment in 33 AA Brigade. This regiment in turn was absorbed into 300 LAA Regt in 1961 when the St Pancras lineage was discontinued.Frederick, p. 1019.Litchfield, pp. 168 & 171.474‚Äì519 Regiments at British Army units from 1947 on. Battle honours The 19th Londons were awarded the following honours: South Africa 1900‚Äì02 (1/19th): Festubert 1915, Loos, Somme 1916 '18, Flers-Courcelette, Morval, Le Transloy, Messines 1917, Ypres 1917, Langemarck 1917, Cambrai 1917, St Quentin, Bapaume 1918, Ancre 1918, Albert 1918, Pursuit to Mons (2/19th): France and Flanders 1915‚Äì16, Doiran 1917, Macedonia 1916‚Äì17, Gaza, El Mughar, Nebi Samwil, Jerusalem, Jericho, Jordan, Megiddo, Sharon, Palestine 1917‚Äì18 Bold text indicates those honours selected to be displayed on the regiment's Colours. The Royal Artillery does not carry battle honours, so none were awarded to the regiment after its conversion. Insignia Upon transfer to the Royal Engineers, the men of 33rd AA Battalion retained their 'XIX County of London' cap badge.Regimental Badges. During the Munich crisis mobilisation, a group of sergeants from 334 Company stole a cockerel with saddle and reins from a roundabout at Baldock Fair. This subsequently became the inanimate mascot of the sergeants' mess, and a colour picture of it was adopted as the company's emblem, used as a vehicle marking in the early part of World War II. After transfer to the RA, red-and-blue arm of service strips were sewn onto battledress. Honorary Colonels The following were appointed Honorary Colonel of the regiment: * George Byng, 3rd Earl of Strafford (formerly Lord Enfield), died 1898. * Hon Col Sir W.J.

Location  Although Enrique Fl√≥rez wrote in 1755 that the location of what had been the town that gave its name to the see was then unknown,Enrique Fl√≥rez, Espa√±a Sagrada, vol. XIV, p. 38 scholars generally accept the statements made by several sources, some of them earlier than Fl√≥rez, that the site of Caliabria was on a high hill by the river Douro, near Almendra, Vila Nova de Foz C√¥a, Portugal.Tamayo de Salazar, Anamnesis, sive conmmemoratio omnium Sanctorum Hispanorum Lyon (1659), vol.

Hist√≥ria da Igreja em Portugal The ruins are now officially signposted as \\"Ru√≠nas de Cal√°bria\\". However, Coura, near Viseu, and Fermoselle near Zamora each have a champion, as do Vilanova de Foz C√¥a and Castelho Melhor, places closer to the generally accepted location.  Ecclesiastical History  = Foundation = The bishopric of Caliabria, documented only since the 7th century, was probably a Visigothic foundation. Before becoming a diocese, Caliabria was a mere parish of the Diocese of Viseu, which was then part of the kingdom of the Suebi or Suevi of Gall√¶cia. It is mentioned as such in a document of the time of that kingdom drawn up between 572 and 589, to which was later added the annotation \\"quae apud Gotos postea sedes fuit\\" (which later, under the Goths, who annexed the kingdom in 585, was a diocese). The exact date of its erection as a diocese under the Visigoths is disputed, one scholar placing it after 621, while another thinks it occurred in the reign of Witteric (603-610),Jos√© Ignacio Mart√≠n Benito, \\"Caliabria y Ciudad Rodrigo\\" (Centro de Estudios Mirobrigenses) or it may be as early as 569, under the Suebi. Historians found no evidence for the recent theory that August√≥briga, i.e. Ancient Ciudad Rodrigo, already was a Roman diocese which the invading Visigoths transferred to Caliabria.Mateo Hern√°ndez Vegas, Ciudad Rodrigo. La catedral y la ciudad, Vol. I, Valencia 2012, pp. 1-5. and P√©rez, op. cit., col. 1010. It was a suffragan see of the Archdiocese of M√©rida (in Estremadura, Spain), Metropolitan capital of the Roman province Lusitania. = Early bishops = The names of four Bishops of Caliabria are recorded among the participants in councils held at Toledo and M√©rida between 633 and 693: # Servus Dei (633-646) # Celedonius (653-660?) # Aloarius (666-670?) # Erv√≠gius (688-693) # ... = Extinction and replacement = Nothing more is known about it until the 8th century Muslim conquest of the Iberian peninsula put an end to the existence of the Diocese of Caliabria, which was however already suppressed in 693. The city was completely ravaged by the Arab invaders, even its very location remains disputed. In 1161, King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n founded the Diocese of Ciudad Rodrigo, while granting the defunct city's territory to that city, perhaps claiming, because of opposition raised by the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of Salamanca, that the new diocese was a revival of that of Caliabria, a title generally used by the first bishop, but not by his successors, by whose time agreement had been reached with Salamanca. However the papal bulla Ex litteris, by which Pope Alexander III confirmed in 1175 the erection of the diocese of di Ciudad Rodrigo, mentions neither Caliabria nor a restoration.  Titular see  The diocese of Caliabria was nominally restored in 1969 as Latin Titular bishopric of Cali√°bria (Portuguese) / Caliabria (Curiate Italian) / Calabriensis (Latin adjective).

Design and development The 1936 Cicogna was a tailless and powered version of the Teichfuss Astore, which was in turn very similar to the RRG Falke designed in 1930 by Alexander Lippisch. Lippisch had developed that conventional, but swept wing, glider from the 1929 RRG Storch IV, the most successful of his early tailless gliders, fitted with an engine in the same year and renamed the RRG Storch V. Thus the Cicogna and Storch IV and V shared a very similar wing, though the Italian motor glider had a 14% greater span. Like the Astore, the Cicogna was a braced high-wing monoplane, its constant chord wing swept at about 10¬∞. The wing was a single spar structure with plywood covering from the spar forward around the leading edge forming a torsion-resistant D-box. Aft of the spar the wing was fabric covered. Ailerons were hinged at right angles to the fuselage and had curved edges which blended into rounded wing tips. The wing, which was mounted with dihedral, was supported over the fuselage by a pair of inverted V-struts from the upper longerons and a small pillar behind the cockpit. A longer faired bracing V-strut joined the lower longeron to the wing at about one third span on each side. Since the Cicogna was tailless it had a pair of straight-edged, short wing tip fins and taller rudders for directional stability and control, the fins assisted by the side area of the flat sided rear fuselage. The fuselage was a ply covered wooden hexagonal structure with deep sides and an open cockpit under the wing, very similar to that of the Astore from nose to the rear of the cockpit but then tapering rapidly in plan to form a short pod. It ended at a concave vertical knife edge with the engine, propeller shaft and pusher configuration propeller under its upper surface; the propeller was as far aft as the aileron hinges. The Cicogna first flew in 1936, though launched as a glider by aerotow. There is no evidence that it flew under power or that the troublesome flat twin engine was ever fitted. Two were built.

She published under her maiden name Monica Betts. Her thesis was entitled The Availability of Food and Predation by the Genus Parus and examined bird populations in the woods in Wytham Woods near Oxford and the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, under the guidance of David Lack. Biography Monica Turner was born Monica Betts, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire in 1925. She had a love of birds and the countryside from a young age. She studied zoology at the University College London before joining the Edward Grey Institute, where she researched under David Lack. She was initially a field assistant for Peter Hartley and then obtained a grant from the Agriculture Research Council for her own research. After her doctorate, she worked on a project funded by the Nature Conservancy with John Gibb followed by teaching at the Oxford Brookes University. Monica married Geoffrey Turner in 1957 and lived in Cumnor, near Oxford. Geoffrey died in 1984. They have two children, Jonathan and Jessica, and also two grandchildren. Turner was a great contributor to village life and was a member of Cumnor Parish Council. She also had a great love of Norwich Terriers. She died in Oxford in 2013, aged 88.Monica Turner, Oxford Mail, 17 October 2013  Education  As an undergraduate student Turner read Zoology at University College London. The university had been re-located to Bangor during the war, and being on the doorstep of Snowdonia National Park appealed, though the final year of her study was completed back in London. She obtained a first class degree. Upon completion of her undergraduate study, she immediately joined the Edward Grey Institute as Peter Hartley's field assistant.  Career  Turner joined the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Oxford in 1948 to conduct research on the foraging behaviour of great tits and blue tits. She was one of the first doctoral students to join the institute after the war, and also one of the first female students. She soon obtained a five-year grant from the Agriculture Research Council and this resulted in her thesis. An understanding of great tit behaviour was thought to be of potential importance in controlling caterpillar populations that were reducing timber production. Her thesis results showed that great tits actually captured a tiny proportion of the caterpillar population, amongst other things. As an early research scientist she was one of few women in a male dominated department. However she went on to have a long academic career and conducted further post-doctoral studies on tits, obtaining a second five-year grant from the Agricultural Research Council. Turner then worked on the Nature Conservancy funded Breckland Research Project with John Gibb on tits and their prey in the Breckland pine woods in the east of England.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Unionist MP, Frederick Alexander Macquisten on 29 February 1940 at the age of 69. He had been MP here since gaining the seat in 1924. Election history Argyllshire had been won by the Unionists at every election since 1924 but was a marginal seat in which the Liberal Party had continued to challenge strongly. The result at the last General election was as follows; Candidates *In August 1939 with the expectation of an imminent General Election, the local Unionists had replaced Macquisten as candidate with 52-year-old Duncan McCallum. He was serving as an Honorary Attach√© at the British Legations in Bulgaria and Egypt. *Back in 1938 the local Liberals had selected 37-year-old John Bannerman to regain the seat at the forthcoming General Election. He was a former Scottish Rugby Union International. Bannerman became active in Liberal politics from the 1930s. He was particularly interested in the problems of depopulation and unemployment for ordinary people in the Scottish Highlands and islands. *Although the Labour party had not contested the seat since 1929, in January 1939 they selected A. MacNeill Weir, a relative of Lauchlin MacNeill Weir who had fought the seat in 1918. At the outbreak of war, the Conservative, Liberal and Labour parties had agreed an electoral truce which meant that when a by-election occurred, the party that was defending the seat would not be opposed by an official candidate from the other two parties. Approaches were made by the Liberals to the Unionists for them to support Bannerman being returned rather than their own candidate. However, with the Liberal Party sitting in opposition to the Chamberlain led Government, this was never likely to happen. Both Bannerman and Weir duly withdrew. On the 8 March, the largely insignificant Scottish National Party chose to intervene. On 12 March, they chose as their candidate, 66-year-old William Power who was from Glasgow. Campaign Polling day was set for 10 April 1940. When nominations closed, it was to reveal a two horse race, between McCallum for the Unionists and Power, for the Nationalists. McCallum was in Egypt at the time of the death of Macquisten and remained there until returning to Scotland after his first campaign meeting on 26 March 1940, more than two weeks after he knew he would be opposed. Half of the constituency was in a restricted area, and candidates and speakers were required to obtain permits to pass in and out. The authorities rejected the permit applications of the Nationalist candidate, effectively restricting his movements. The SNP campaign sought to highlight government neglect of the Highlands. Power chose not to disagree with the government's foreign policy. Neville Chamberlain sent a message to McCallum stating, We are fighting for just and durable peace which will restore freedom and security to Europe and rid us of the perpetual menace of war. The Premier expressed the hope that \\"the electors of Argyllshire will send you to Parliament by such a majority as will provide convincing evidence of the national unity of purpose in the prosecution of the war.\\" Result As expected the Unionists held the seat. The SNP managed to poll over 7,000 votes, the vast majority of which were believed to be from the 11,000 people who voted Liberal last time. Aftermath McCallum took his seat on the benches behind Neville Chamberlain, but within a month, Chamberlain had been replaced by Winston Churchill. This result catapulted Power into the leadership of the SNP. However, it did not represent any progression for the SNP in Argyll as the party did not contest the seat at the following General election. Instead both Liberal and Labour candidates who had withdrawn from the by-election came forward to challenge McCallum; The result at the following General election; See also * List of United Kingdom by-elections * United Kingdom by- election records References 1940 elections in the United Kingdom By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Scottish constituencies 1940 in Scotland 1940s elections in Scotland Argyllshire April 1940 events ","title":"1940 Argyllshire by-election"},{"id":"41189667","text":"Netechma simulans is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

One of the oldest public squares in the city, it covers an area of . It is no longer used as a market place except for the Christmas market and the annual Freimarkt Fair at the end of October.  History and Development  Market square in 1641 by Matth√§us Merian Townhall red, archbishop's palace blue, Sch√ºtting olive, stock exchange (brown, 1614 to 1687 an uncovered area after the erasion of the shoe hall), general outline like in 1630, possible (red) and fiktive (green) views of Merian's depiction Hanseatic Cross on the market At least parts of the market place had been in function since the age of Charlemagne. Its southern side originally was the bank of river Balge (river), a branch of the Weser and Bremen's first port. There was an easy access for boats, but this section of the bank was too low for permanent buildings. From late 12th to late 13th century, the area of the market place was levelled and plastered in several stages. Theories that before the construction of the Bremen Town Hall in 1405 to 1410 all or only most of the market activities took place near Liebfrauenkirche have been falsified by archeological findings. Meantime with the townhall, Roland Statue was erected on the market square. Some time later, a stone wall was built between the inner and the outer areas of the square. The inner space was used for the market. A rule was made which allowed only merchants whose vehicles could pass one of the seven openings in the wall to sell their products. The city council made this rule in order to ensure that there was sufficient space for pedestrians between the market stalls. In the end of the 18th or beginning of the 19th century, the wall was removed and replaced by a circle of columns. At the same time, the market place lost its outstanding importance as a centre of trade and commerce even though it continued to be used as a market until mid 20th century. In 1836, the square was repaved with sandstone. Inside the circle of columns, darker stones depicted a wheel with 10 spokes. At centre of the wheel, reddish stones form a Hanseatic Cross. With a diameter of , it commemorates the importance of the Hanseatic Legion during the Wars of Liberation (1813-1815). Between February and June 2002, the pavement was renewed without changing its historical layout.  Buildings  Compilation of photos taken from Merian's possible views The building ensemble which flanks the Marktplatz is considered one of the most beautiful in Germany. In July 2004, the part consisting of the Roland Statue and the Town Hall was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sandstone and brick are uniformly used for the fa√ßades of the buildings. Many objects of historical interest surround the Marktplatz. The entire complex is listed as a heritage site. * Am Markt 1: Rathscaf√©/Deutsches Haus, 1908‚Äì1911 * Am Markt 9: Haus Jonas und Kaune, 1600 und 1955 * Am Markt 11: Raths-Apotheke, 1893‚Äì1894 und 1957/58 * Am Markt 12: Sparkasse am Markt, 1755 und 1958 * Am Markt 13: Sch√ºtting, 1537‚Äì1538 * Am Markt 14, 15 and 16: Bankhaus Neelmeyer, Wilckens‚Äôsches Haus, Bremische Hypothekenbank, Gesch√§ftshaus ‚ÄûZum Roland‚Äú, Niedersaechsische Bank * Am Markt 17: Medizinisches Warenhaus, 1950 * Am Markt 18: Eduscho-Haus, Bankhaus Carl F.

He was the lawsuit's named defendant by virtue of his position. Tobeluk vs. Lind was a landmark case in Alaskan Native education. The 27 teenage plaintiffs brought suit against the State of Alaska, claiming that Native American boarding schools were discriminatory and unjust. The case is widely known as the \\"Molly Hootch Case\\" after the first plaintiff named. At the time of the case, Alaskan Native parents were forced to send their children away for schooling because of a lack of quality local educational facilities in their towns. Boarding schools had historically been used as a tactic of assimilating Native students into white culture. Alaskan Native children were sent far from their parents for their secondary education, often heading to the contiguous 48 states and boarding with local non-Native families. They were thus immersed in a situation that was both geographically (Oregon, Oklahoma, etc.) and culturally removed from their place of origin. The plaintiffs alleged that this situation led to mistreatment of the Native students and a high dropout rate among them (65% within two years, in one documented case), signs of educational inequality. In October 1976, the signing of the Tobeluk Consent Decree committed the government to building local high schools in Alaska, which they have since done with positive results on retention rates. The state by means of the consent decree agreed to create a secondary school in any village with at least fifteen high school-aged children.

In 2010 she was appointed Director of the European Molecular Biology Organization.  Education After completing her studies in mathematics and biology at the University of Bonn and the University of Heidelberg, Maria Leptin worked for her PhD at the Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland, (1979-1983) studying B-lymphocyte activation under the supervision of Fritz Melchers. Career In 1984 she moved, as a post doctoral fellow (1984-1987), to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), Cambridge, UK, where she started her research on position-specific (PS) integrins involved in the embryonic development of Drosophila, joining the laboratory of Michael Wilcox. This work laid the foundations for her future work in the field of molecular morphogenesis. In 1988, Maria Leptin was appointed as staff scientist at the same institution. She then went to Pat O‚ÄôFarrell's lab at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), as a visiting scientist. This was the occasion for her to begin studying gastrulation. After this experience Maria Leptin joined the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in T√ºbingen, Germany, where, between 1989 and 1994, she worked as group leader.

Federal judicial service Kilty received a recess appointment from President Thomas Jefferson on March 23, 1801, to the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, to the new Chief Judge seat authorized by 2 Stat. 103. He was nominated to the same position by President Jefferson on January 6, 1802. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 26, 1802, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on January 27, 1806, due to his resignation. Chancellor of Maryland Upon the death of Kilty's predecessor, Alexander Contee Hanson, the Governor of Maryland had first offered the vacancy in the office of Chancellor of Maryland to Gabriel Duvall, who declined, and then to Robert Smith, the acting Attorney General of the United States, who also declined. Kilty was then appointed, and he accepted, taking his seat on January 26, 1806. His opinions as Chancellor were noted to be \\"generally very concise, not laden with citations of authorities like Bland's, but showing close familiarity with English equity jurisprudence\\". His most important work as Chancellor was his 1811 report on the British Statutes in force in Maryland. The work received high commendation from the Court of Appeals and the profession generally. In Dashiell vs. Attorney-General, 5 H. & J., 403, the court said that \\"the book was compiled, printed and distributed under the sanction of the State for the use of its officers and is a safe guide in exploring an otherwise very dubious path\\". Kilty also undertook other public activities during his Chancellorship. In 1807, he was appointed to a committee of prominent citizens to address a British blockade of American vessels; and in January 1808 he assisted in drafting a resolution further condemning British actions against U.S. shipping. Kilty held that office until his death on October 10, 1821, in Annapolis. A memorial was held on October 11, 1821 in the Baltimore County Court, and the National Intelligencer for October 17, 1821, reported an account of the action of the Bar of the District of Columbia on the death of Kilty. Kilty was succeeded in office by John Johnson Sr.. References Sources William J.

Two were built. Design and development The 1936 Astore was very similar to the RRG Falke designed by Alexander Lippisch in 1930. Like the Falke it was intended as a secondary or intermediate trainer, its swept wing bringing intrinsic stability and safety for the inexperienced pilot. The Astore was a little larger than the Falke, 11% in span and 19% in length. The Astore was a braced high-wing monoplane, its constant chord wing swept at about 10¬∞. The wing was a single spar structure with plywood covering from the spar forward around the leading edge forming a torsion-resistant D-box. Aft of the spar the wing was fabric covered. Ailerons were hinged at right angles to the fuselage and were lobate, with curved edges that blended into rounded wing tips. The wing, which was mounted with dihedral, was supported over the fuselage by a pair of inverted V-struts from the upper longerons and a small pillar behind the cockpit. A longer faired bracing V-strut joined the lower longeron to the wing at about one third span on each side. The fuselage was a ply covered wooden hexagonal structure with deep sides and an open cockpit under the wing. A straight tapered tailplane was positioned forward of a small fin, carrying elevators which had a cut-out between them for operation of the straight tapered balanced rudder. The rudder extended to the keel, protected by a small tail bumper under the fin. The undercarriage was a standard, long skid equipped with rubber shock absorbers; wheels on a short axle attached to the lower fuselage provided an alternative, narrow track, undercarriage. The Astore first flew in 1936. Two were built and used by the Pavullo nel Frignano flying school.

Nadorp was born in Isselburg into a family of artists. He was the only son of Johann Theodor Nadorp and Gertrud Anna Stroof. After his education at the Anholt City school, he was joined at age 20 by a fellowship of his country gentlemen Prince Constantin of Salm-Salm in the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, where he trained as a historical painter with his teacher Joseph Bergler. Nadorp was the favorite pupil of Bergler. In 1822 he received the gold medal of the Academy. When in 1826 his mentor died, Nadorp broke his tents from Prague and returned in 1827 for a few months in his hometown district of Anholt in Isselburg. In the fall of 1827 Nadorp traveled with his companions Prince Franz of Salm-Salm to Rome. The city of Rome drew at the time many German artists, such as Peter Cornelius, Johann Friedrich Overbeck and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Nadorp was quite fast in the group of German artists, called the \\"Nazarenes\\". He was one of the founders of the Roman K√ºnstlerbund (1829) and the German Artists' Union (1845). The years 1840-1850 are among his most fertile. Numerous drawings surviving. During this time, Nadorp met the King Ludwig I of Bavaria, and they both shared a friendship. 1859 Nadorp was received by King Frederick William IV of Prussia, and led to his first government contract. Nadorp left Rome only rarely in the nearly 50 years of local work. In 1862 he returned for a short time back in his hometown. For his baptismal church of St. Pancras, he created an altarpiece The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple and drew the located shortly before the demolition of the old town church. In 1876 Prince Alfred I of Salm-Salm granted him an annuity. Nadorp, which is considered a romantic German painter in style, died shortly thereafter in Rome and buried at Campo Santo Teutonico next to St. Peter in the Vatican. His entire estate was transferred to the Princes of Salm -Salm and can still be seen today in the Museum Wasserburg Anholt and in the parish church of St. Pancras.

Peck's portraiture ‚Äì with its distinctive style ‚Äî is a prime example of 19th century American folk art. He also become known for advocating abolitionism , racial equality, temperance, public education, women's rights, and pacifism.Turner, Glennette Tilley. The Underground Railroad in Illinois, 2001.  Early life and education  Peck was born in Cornwall, Vermont, the ninth son of Jacob and Elizabeth Peck. Peck's ancestors helped found the New Haven Colony; his father worked as a blacksmith and served as a private in the Revolutionary War.Lipman, Jean and Armstrong, Tom. American Folk Painters of the Three Centuries, 1980. Peck married Harriet Corey (1806-1887) in 1825 and the couple eventually had thirteen children. The Peck family moved to Jordan, New York in 1828 and lived there until moving westward to Chicago in 1836. A year later Peck finally settled in Babcock's Grove (now Lombard) approximately twenty- five miles west of Chicago. On his 160 acres of farmland, Peck built a -story timber-frame house (completed in 1839) that still stands today. He grew crops and raised Merino sheep, the latter being a way to produce raw material for clothes without supporting the Southern-based cotton industry and its use of African slave labor. No records exist to indicate that Peck received any formal art education. His work may have been influenced by William Jennys, a primitive portrait painter who was active in Vermont around the time Peck lived there. Peck also would have had access to art instruction texts that were housed in the library of the Cornwall Young Gentleman's Society.  Artwork  Peck primarily painted portraits (although he also dabbled in decorative furniture painting). Peck's portraiture can be divided into three distinctive periods, based on where he lived at the time. = Vermont Period, ca. 1820 - 1828 = Peck's earliest works date to around 1820 and consist primarily of waist-length oil portraits on wood panels; many of his earliest pieces depicted members of his own family. Early on Peck established his characteristic simple approach to portraiture. During this period the figures in Peck's paintings have somber faces with hard, angular planes, and immobile expressions. The figures are painted against dark, undercoated backgrounds. By keeping the portraits to the waist, Peck avoided the challenges of painting full-figures. Portrait of a Gentleman. Note the rabbit tracks hidden in the vest. Harriet Corey Peck, the wife of Sheldon Peck Peck's signature decorative motif ‚Äì the rabbit track ‚Äì is already well established in this period. The three brushstrokes (one long stoke flanked by two shorter ones) resembles the footprint of a rabbit and reappears often in Peck's portraits, usually found in clothing or somewhere in the background. While this three brushstroke motif was popular during the period ‚Äì particularly among ornamental painters working on furniture or tinware ‚Äì it is so closely associated with Peck that it has become his de facto signature as he did not sign his paintings (a common practice at the time).In addition, ongoing research attempts to link Peck's trademark \\"rabbit track\\" as a symbol of the anti-slavery movement, as the one known pro-slavery (or at least apathetic) subject among his paintings does not have the rabbit tracks. However, this remains speculation until further research is done. = New York Period, 1828 - 1836 = Upon his arrival in New York in 1828, Peck continued to paint half-length portraits on wood panels as he had in Vermont. He did, however, begin to use a somewhat brighter color palette and began embellishing his subjects with personal accessories such as jewelry, Bibles, fruit, decorated furniture, and swags of drapery in the background. These were popular portrait conventions during the period and suggest that Peck was influenced by ‚Äì or at the very least, observed ‚Äì the work of other artists. = Illinois Period, 1836 - 1869 = John J. Wagner Family. Wagner was a fellow abolitionist; the newspaper he's holding is the anti-slavery Western Citizen. In 1836 Peck moved to Chicago where he lived for only a few months before moving once again and settling in Babcock's Grove. Once in Illinois, Peck abandoned wood panels in favor of canvas. During his first years in the state, Peck continued to paint half-length portraits similar to those he had painted back East. It is in Illinois, however, that the most radical shift in Peck's work occurs. About 1845 daguerreotypes were gaining in popularity in the United States. To compete against photography and the advantages it offered, Peck introduced a brighter color palette to his work. He also employed a horizontal format, which featured multiple full length figures, their arrangement taking cues from photography. (see image at right) Additionally, Peck would add a trompe l'oeil frame painted directly onto the canvas. This was likely done to reduce the overall cost of the painting by sparing the customer the expense of having the canvas framed.  Activism  From 1828 to 1836, Peck lived in an area of New York known as the burned-over district, a hot bed of various reform movements in the 19th century, including abolitionism, temperance, women's rights, and public education. Peck adopted many of these beliefs and advocated for social change throughout his lifetime. = Abolitionism = Peck was considered a \\"radical abolitionist\\" who advocated for the immediate end of slavery as well as equal rights for African-Americans. While living in Illinois he was a volunteer agent for the abolitionist newspaper the Western Citizen, meaning he would collect dues on behalf of the newspaper as well as disseminate the Citizen's anti-slavery views.Western Citizen, Chicago, \\"Receipts for the Citizen, from Jan. 11 to Jan. 18,\\" January 18, 1848. In addition to working for the Western Citizen, Peck was a delegate for the Liberty Party ‚Äì a political party whose main focus was the abolition of slavery.Western Citizen, Chicago, \\"State Convention of the Liberty Party of Illinois\\" Feb. 1, 1844, Western Citizen, Chicago, \\"A Call for a North-Western Liberty Convention at Chicago\\" May 6, 1846. Peck was also a member of the DuPage County Anti-Slavery Society (part of the Illinois State Anti-Slavery Society).Western Citizen, Chicago, \\"Liberty Mass Meeting\\" Jan. 18, 1848 In 1856, Peck served as a DuPage County delegate to the Illinois State Abolitionism Convention, which a New York Times article at the time dubbed a \\"Convention of Radical Abolitionists,\\" meaning that the ideas expressed went beyond ending slavery but encompassed racial equality as well.New York Times, \\"Illinois State Abolition Convention ‚Äì An Electoral Ticket Nominated,\\" Aug. 11, 1856. In addition to working with abolitionist parties, Peck would often invite guest speakers to his home to lecture about the evils of slavery.Chicago Press and Tribune, \\"Anti-Slavery Meetings\\" Oct. 3, 1859. Two prominent African-American speakers who came to the Peck house were Johnny Jones (a free-born mulatto who was active in the Chicago anti- slavery movement and was an associate of John Brown) and H. Ford Douglass (an escaped slave who was a celebrated orator and friend of Frederick Douglass).Peck, Frank, journal, copy at the Lombard Historical Society, Lombard, IL, p. 4-5.  Underground Railroad  Numerous accounts exist to confirm that Peck actively worked as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. It is generally believed that Peck would hide freedom seekers on his property and then move them via wagon to Chicago. This would enable the freedom seekers to travel to Canada via rail or the Great Lakes. Another possible route was along the Fox Valley (many of whose residents hired Peck to paint their portraits) northward on foot or canoe along the Fox River to Wisconsin and thence Canada. (Escaping to Canada was necessary after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 became law, because escaped slaves could still be returned to bondage even if they reached free states in the North.) Peck traveled frequently throughout north eastern Illinois to paint his subjects and this travel provided a cover for his Underground Railroad work. His youngest son, Frank Peck, recorded details about his father's work in journals and often shared how his family's home was part of the Underground Railroad: > Back in my boy hood days, my father, who was an abolitionist, helped the > Negroes escape from slavery in the South. Our home was used as a > headquarters for all opponents of slavery in this part of the country, a > station for the underground railway. I can remember one incident as clearly > as if it was yesterday ‚Äì when my father protected seven Negroes one night, > when I was a small boy, helping them on their way to the Chicago > district.Lombard Spectator, Lombard, Illinois, \\"Lombard's Oldest Born > Citizen Busy on 'Reminiscences,'\\" September 3, 1931. Frank Peck also recounts the slave spirituals that he sang with the freedom seekers at his family's home, in particular the songs sung by an Underground Railroad conductor (and escaped slave) known as \\"Old Charley\\": > Roll on tibler moon, guide the tabler not astray Whilest the nightingale > song is in full tune While I sadly complain to the moon.Peck, Frank, > journal, copy at the Lombard Historical Society, Lombard, IL, p. 2-3. (Sung in slave dialect, \\"tibler moon\\" is thought to be the \\"traveling moon\\" ‚Äì a full, bright moon whose light would aid escapees during their journey.) Frank Peck's daughter also recalled how freedom seekers were, \\"hid in barns around the [Peck] homestead, then carried away the next day in a load of hay on their way to the Canadian border and freedom.\\"Lombard Spectator, 1950. Sheldon Peck and his wife Harriet, ca. 1860. Harriet was also active in various social movements. = Temperance = The anti-slavery and temperance movements were closely linked in the 19th century, and Peck advocated for both causes. Peck held temperance meetings on his property, and they were often advertised in the abolitionist Western Citizen newspaper.Western Citizen, \\"Temperance Meeting,\\" Oct. 24, 1848. Additionally, the Peck family would host \\"temperance picnics at the Grove,\\" an opportunity for Chicagoans to enjoy a day-long, liquor-free excursion to Peck's farm in Babcock's Grove.Western Citizen, \\"Temperance Meeting at Babcock's Grove,\\" March 16, 1852. Like many people at the time, Peck believed that liquor led to a variety of social and health problems. His youngest son, Frank Peck, recounted how prevalent the idea of temperance was while growing up: > The temperance movement was much discussed...I am sorry to say that many of > my friends and acquaintances have filled untimely graves from the effect of > strong drink with deliriums and often troubles caused from it and I have > helped care for some of them and have only one conclusion, it is a good > thing to shun entirely. = Public Education = Prior to the 1820s, free public education was not considered a responsibility of government. The reform movements of the 19th century, however, changed that view, and Peck in particular supported free public education as a means to protect democracy against ignorance. Upon his arrival in Babcock's Grove in 1836, Peck established a school in his house. He personally paid the salary for the school's teacher, Amelda Powers Dodge, and invited all the children in the area to attend classes. He later erected another building on his property for use as a school and public meeting space. Peck later served as superintendent of a Sunday school organized by the local Methodist church.Vandercook, Dorothy I. and Kaiser, Blythe. Glen Ellyn's Story and Her Neighbors in DuPage, 1976. Sheldon Peck's home today. Death and legacy Peck died on March 19, 1869, survived by his wife and ten of his thirteen children. He is buried in the Lombard Cemetery. His youngest son, Frank, kept a diary which historians find very useful in documenting negro spirituals as well as the Underground Railroad. =Sheldon Peck Homestead= Sheldon Peck's 1839 house was donated to the Lombard Historical Society by his granddaughter. It is now operated as the Sheldon Peck Homestead, a museum dedicated to Peck's work as an activist and artist. The house is listed on the register of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom as a confirmed Underground Railroad site. =Value of his work= The value of Peck's art has risen considerably over the years, mirroring the rise in status of folk and primitive art. His paintings can be seen at museums around the United States including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago History Museum, and the American Folk Art Museum in New York City. Because Peck never signed his work, \\"new\\" Peck portraits are constantly being discovered.

It is also known to produce sporangia when cultured on starch or skim milk agar. Very few strains have been found and cultured, thus A. italicus is relatively uncharacterized. Characteristics * Optimum growth temperature is 26 ¬∞C * Optimum growth medium is oatmeal agar * Respires aerobically * Gram-positive and motile * Pathogenicity and other health effects are unknown Discovery A. italicus was discovered and isolated from a soil sample obtained from an orchard at Pontelongo, Italy. = Laboratory studies = During experiments led by Grazia Beretta searching for antibiotic producers from some of the uncommon genera of the Actinomycetales, A. italicus did not produce any antibiotic activity against either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, and differed in its morphological, cultural, and physiological characteristics. Studies were undertaken to determine whether the first strain, A 52212, of A. italicus represented a new species of Actinoplanes.  Materials and methods  A. italicus was cultivated using various standard media to determine optimum growth conditions. The media were incubated in the dark at 28 ¬∞C. Pigment production was determined by exposing the media to daylight and artificial light at night. Stock slant cultures were kept on oatmeal agar. Every 8 to 16 days, the colony characteristics were observed on starch agar Petri dishes. Using A Dictionary of Color by Maerz and Paul, color was determined and assigned to the varying pigments produced. Carbon sources were investigated. The media containing carbon sources were inoculated with mycelium, washed twice, and suspended in distilled water. Optimal temperatures were determined by incubating slants of oatmeal agar at 15, 20, 28, 40, and 50 ¬∞C.  Macroscopic examination  The notable cherry-red vegetative mycelium is produced on most of the media used in the experiment. Other members of Actinoplanes, when grown on the same media, produced a yellow and orange vegetative mycelium.  Microscopic examination  The vegetative mycelium is composed of thin and twisted hyphae. The sporangia produced on starch and skim milk agar have wrinkled surfaces and vary in shapes from spherical to oval and piriform. The shape of the sporangia takes on a more regular shape immediately before rupturing. The spores released are highly motile, taking on varying shapes of spherical and oval. Physiology In peptone-yeast extract-iron agar, A. italicus produces H2S. Within a skim milk agar medium, it was able to hydrolyze casein. Other notable physiological characteristics include its ability to liquefy gelatin, produce tyrosinase, and peptonization without coagulation. The optimal temperature ranges between 28 and 37 ¬∞C. = Carbon source = Carbon sources used by A. italicus A. italicus uses inositol, fructose, rhamnose, mannitol, xylose, arabinose, sucrose, and glucose as carbon sources for growth. It differs from many members of its genus such as A. utahensis and A. missouriensis, which do not use inositol; from A phillipinesis and A. armeniacus, which use raffinose; and from A. brasiliensis and A phillipinesis, which usw cellulose. A. italicus is also noted to use natural rubber as a sole carbon source. = Soluble pigments = When cultured in different growth media, A. italicus tends to produce varying soluble pigments based on its carbon source. On some media, such as nutrient agar, calcium-malate agar, and Bennet's agar, A. italicus does not produce any pigment at all. On oatmeal, starch, and skim milk agar, the characteristic cherry-red pigment is produced. An amber color is produced when the organism is cultured on Hickey and Tresner agar, potato agar, and nitrate broth, whereas glucose asparagine agar and tyrosine agar would result in a pink color. A deep orange yellowish pigment is produced by growth on Czapek glucose agar. Phylogeny A. italicus belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is most closely related to Actinoplanes couchii with 98.9% similarity using DNA-DNA hybridization. = Actinoplanes = Actinoplanes belongs to the family Actinoplanaceae. Some characteristics of this genus include able to form motile spores, as well as aerial mycelia and spherica. They are useful in that they can produce ramoplanin, teichoplanin, and valienamine, all of which are critical for the pharmaceutical companies. They generally produce a yellow or orange vegetative mycelium and ordinarily do not produce soluble pigments.

Jha's most recent research has examined mindfulness training with soldiers in the U.S. military with the Strong Projects as a tool in improving situational awareness and reducing stress measured through brainwave activity and cognitive behavioral tools. Her work has been featured in numerous publications, popular press articles, she has spoken at the World Economic Forum, the Aspen Institute, and the NY Academy of Sciences and has presented her research to the Dalai Lama, Mind and Life Institute, and Poptech. Education and career Jha received her B.S. in Psychology from the University of Michigan in 1993, and her PhD in Psychology from the University of California-Davis in 1998. During her graduate school she worked with Michael Gazzaniga and Ron Mangun. From 1998 to 2001 she completed her post- doctoral training in Neuroimaging and Functional MRI (fMRI), at Duke University with Gregory McCarthy. From 2002 to 2010 she worked as an assistant professor at University of Pennsylvania at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and Department of Psychology. In 2010 she joined the University of Miami as an associate professor in the Department of Psychology. Since arriving at the University of Miami, she has co-founded the Mindfulness Research and Practice Initiative and serves as the Director of Contemplative Neuroscience for that effort. Research Jha has examined the executive functioning mechanisms of the brain such as attention, and working memory, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging, event related potential, electroencephalography, signal detection and behavioral methods. Her lab has investigated mindfulness training as a route to strengthen attentional processes as well as reduce perceived stress, and improve mood. Jha published one of the first studies on how attention may be modified by mindfulness training, and the first study of how mindfulness may protect against degradation in working memory in high stress groups, specifically military cohorts. Her research has followed two parallel lines of questioning ‚Äì one seeking to determine the neural mechanisms of executive functioning and the other developing and evaluating ways to bolster executive functioning through training. =Findings= Jha's research into mindfulness-based training seeks to determine the benefits of mindfulness training and how this training changes cognitive and affective processes at neural and behavioral levels. Jha, A.P., Stanley, E.A., Kiyonaga, A., Wong, L., & Gelfand., L. (2010). Examining the Protective Effects of Mindfulness Training on Working Memory and Affective Experience. Emotion, 10(1), 54‚Äì64. Her findings have consistently shown that mindfulness training improves numerous aspects of both cognitive and emotional health. As well, she has demonstrated that there may be a dose- response effect of mindfulness training, so that greater benefits are observed with greater time spent engaging in mindfulness exercises. Military STRONG Project logoExposure to significant and potentially traumatizing stress is pervasive for military personnel during times of war. Such stress can lead to a degradation of psychological health with potentially dire consequences for the individual (e.g. PTSD), mission (e.g. impaired judgment), and family (e.g. divorce), amongst others. In some of the first studies of mindfulness training in the military, Jha partnered with the Mind Fitness Training InstituteMind Fitness Training Institute (MMFT) and training developed and delivered by Dr. Elizabeth Stanley of Georgetown University. An 8-week mindfulness training course was offered to Marines preparing to deploy to Iraq. She found that the more time Marines spent engaging in mindfulness exercises outside of the classroom, the more they improved in their working memory and mood. Jha suggested that working memory capacity may be a core cognitive capacity necessary to preserve psychological resilience in high stress cohorts. These findings suggest that even in individuals facing extraordinary levels of stress, mindfulness training may help improve overall mental health and well-being. Joint Force Quarterly Teachers In a recent study with teachers, Jha and collaborators looked at whether mindfulness training would be effective at improving the mental well-being of elementary and secondary school teachers. Roeser, R. W., Schonert-Reichl, K. A., Jha, A. P., Cullen, M., Wallace, L., Wilensky, R., Oberle, E., Thomson, K., Taylor, C., & Harrison, J. (2013). Mindfulness Training and Reductions in Teacher Stress and Burnout: Results From Two Randomized, Waitlist-Control Field Trials. Journal of Educational Psychology. Following the completion of the 8-week mindfulness training course, teachers reported less occupational stress, less occupational burnout, as well as lower symptoms of both depression and anxiety, while increasing their working memory capacity. Importantly, teachers who received mindfulness training continued to improve on all four measures over the three-month period following the completion of the course. This finding suggests that not only does mindfulness training have an immediate positive impact on emotional health but that the effects persist, providing long-term improvements in several aspects of well-being. Children Many types of contemplative practices, including mindfulness, train individuals to learn to control their attention, critical to success in a variety of settings, including school. In a recent study, Jha and colleagues sought to determine whether, and if so, how, concentrative meditation training can affect attentional processing in school age children. Davidson, R., Dunne, J., Eccles, J. S., Engle, A., Greenberg, M., Jennings, P., Jha, A. P., Jinpa, T., Lantieri, L., Meyer, D., Roeser, R. W., & Vago, D. (2012). Contemplative Practices and Mental Training: Prospects for American Education. Child Development Perspectives. 6(2): 146-153. The results indicated that even in children as young as 13, meditation training improved children's ability to achieve and maintain alertness. Additionally, training improved children's ability to resolve conflicts between divergent actions, which may improving their ability to complete tasks as instructed. These findings suggest that meditation training may improve academic performance. In another study in children who are part of the juvenile justice system, Jha and NYU collaborators investigated if mindfulness training vs. an active comparison training might protect against degradation in attention that may accompany being incarcerated. Leonard, N. R., Jha, A. P., Casarjian, B., Goolsaran, M., Garcia, C., Cleland, C. M., Gwadz, M. V., & Massey, Z. (2013). Mindfulness Training Improves Attentional Task Performance in Incarcerated Youth: A Group Randomized Controlled Intervention Trial. Frontiers in Psychology. While those in the active comparison group degraded in their attention over a several month interval of being incarcerated, those in the mindfulness group did not. Again, Jha suggests that attention may serve as a core cognitive capacity necessary for resilience. In addition, attention is necessary for effective decision making under stress and regulation of behavior. Greater access to these capacities with mindfulness training may help promote resilience and reduce recidivism in children who have entered the juvenile justice system.

It is located within an old English landscape garden and its first mentioning dates back to 1376. In 1962, the main castle building was declared a cultural heritage monument. While foundations of today's main castle building incorporate elements from the 14th-century building, the buildings visible today were built in the 16th and 17th century by Coesfeld architect Henric de Suer and his son Johann. They were built for the families Stecke and Nesselrode. After the First World War, the main castle building was no longer used as a residence and started to deteriorate. Subsidence caused by the widespread sub-surface mining in the surrounding industrial Ruhr area added to the structural damage, bringing the castle buildings close to collapse. Only radical restoration measures taken by the Regional Association of Westphalia-Lippe () from 1974 to 1989 saved the late Gothic castle complex from total decline. Today it is used as a venue for concerts, cultural events and festivities. It also houses a caf√©. The castle's park is popular for walking, picknicking, jogging and biking. History =Owners and residents= Herten Castle entrance The Herten family, vassals of the Werden Abbey (now part of Essen), was first documented in 1286 with the mention of \\"Gerlach von Hertene\\". At that time, their residence was probably in the center of today's city next to St. Antonius church. In the 14th century, the family with \\"Ritter\\" (knight) status built a fortified house on the site of today's castle. In 1376, this building was mentioned as fief of Werden Abbey. Through marriage, the Herten house fell into the possession of the von Galen family in mid-14th century. In 1488, it changed hands in the same manner to Dietrich von Stecke zur Leythe. Ultimately, in 1529 Anna von Stecke married Betram I. von Nesselrode. As part of the powerful house of Nesselrode, he was steward for the Electorate of Cologne in the Recklinghausen district and expedited the modification and extension of the buildings in 1530. For nearly 300 years, the castle complex remained property of the house of Nesselrode. After the last Nesselrode son and heir died in 1826, the castle fell into possession of parts of the house of Droste zu Vischering, who called themselves \\"Droste zu Vischering von Nesselrode-Reichenstein\\". The family kept the castle as their residence until 1920, when they moved on to another castle. Due to the lack of maintenance, deserted Herten castle started to deteriorate. During the occupation of the Ruhr by French troops between 1923 and 1925, the castle was used for the housing of French troops. They left the castle devastated. The current owner is the Regional Association of Westphalia-Lippe () which bought the then run-down castle along with the surrounding park in 1974. The park changed hands in 2008, becoming property of the city of Herten. =Construction history= The Herten family built a medieval tower house in the first half of the 14th century, relics of which can be found in the vaulted basement of today's northern wing. The rib vault stands on foundations that are probably even older. A salvage excavation in 1974 produced more building elements from that time which couldn't be reconstructed. Starting in 1520, the tower house was expanded and converted into a late Gothic quadrangular castle. Herten castle bears resemblance to the Schloss Nordkirchen of that time, because they were built by the same architects: Henric de Suer and his son Johann. After the completion of this project in 1560, contemporary reports describe the castle complex as an \\"enormous building with fortifications and ramparts\\". During the Cologne War, it withstood a two-year siege led by Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg. Remains of these ramparts can still be found by the chestnut avenue to the eastern side of the castle. Bertram von Nesselrode and his wife Lucia von Hatzfeld started remodeling the castle buildings around 1650. This included removing fortifications from the complex and adding a ceiling fresco utilizing linear perspective in the great hall of the eastern wing. The fresco was rediscovered during the 20th-century restoration works and is unique in Westphalia. View of the park and the orangery, around 1730 Around Christmas 1687, a fire destroyed much of the northern and western wing, obliterating most of the precious library. From 1687 to 1702, the castle was reconstructed in today's form by Freiherr Franz von Nesselrode-Reichenstein. He also added the elaborate portal on the western wing of the castle and ordered the creation of a French formal garden with numerous fountains and statues. Around 1730, the Wallonian painter Renier Roidkin created quill drawings of Herten Castle's gardens. 20 of these drawings are still conserved. About 200 meters (650 ft) north of the castle, an orangery was completed in 1725, following an English trend that became fashionable then. Following that trend, the French formal garden was converted into an English landscape garden between 1814 and 1817. When the castle complex ceased being used in 1925, it was already in bad shape after being neglected by its owners and vandalized by French occupying troops. This and the structural damage inflicted onto the castle by coal mining subsidence left it on the verge of collapse. First safeguarding measures on the building foundations were taken in 1967. Since this did not affect the part of the buildings above ground, these parts kept deteriorating until the Regional Association of Westphalia-Lippe bought the castle complex ruins in 1974. Restoration measures were taken immediately and lasted until 1989. A considerable amount of original building fabric was beyond repair: the entire foundations as well as the ceilings were replaced by reinforced concrete structures and most of the castle was re-roofed. Description Today's Herten Castle complex consists of two parts. The main castle is a moated red brick building with round towers at three corners and crow-stepped gables. A red brick carriage house and a chapel are on a separate island in the moat to the west of the main castle. A third island in the moat to the south of the main castle was probably used as a garden. = Main castle = Gothic arcade columns The main castle consists of four wings creating an inner courtyard. Except for the one-story southern wing, the wings have two stories. Both the eastern and western wings have crow-stepped gables with pinnacles. Round two- story towers with cone-shaped roofs are at three corners of the main castle. The main portal, built in today's form at the beginning of the 18th century, is in the western wing. This wing also contains the best-preserved portion of a rhombical pattern of glazed bricks within the castle's fa√ßade. The portal is framed by an aedicula. Cartouches to the left and right of the portal tell about the families who resided at Herten Castle, the fire and subsequent reconstruction, along with the motto QUAERATUR VIRTUS ‚Äì INVENIETUR HONOS (Search for virtue - and honor will be found). The northern fa√ßade of the inner courtyard is framed by two staircase towers. The southern fa√ßade consists of a late Gothic arcade, the columns of which have unusual spiral- like riffles. Most rooms of the main castle had to be modified during the 1980s restoration. Only the two representative rooms in the eastern wing retained their original baroque features: for example, the smaller room's stucco ceiling dating back to around 1700. Especially valuable is the ceiling fresco from the mid-17th century in the main festival room. = Buildings on the moat's western island = ; Carriage house The core of today's red brick carriage house probably dates back to the 16th century. It probably was only the western part of a larger building. On its northern end, the ruins of an adjacent wing can still be seen. The castle chapel ; Chapel Originally, the castle's chapel was within the southern wing of the main castle building. In 1908 however, a coal mining company bought the grounds of a neighboring castle, Schloss Grimberg, as an addition to their premises. While the Grimberg castle building, now wedged between a coal mine and a canal harbor, slowly deteriorated and was torn down completely in the 1960s, the castle's Gothic chapel was immediately moved to stand next to Herten Castle's carriage house on the moat's western island. Parts of the chapel date back to the 16th century. It consists of three aisles and the Baroque interior was installed in 1747. At the front walls of the side aisles, sandstone epitaphs of Bertram von Nesselrode, his wife Lucia von Hatzfeld, and Bertram's parents Franz von Nesselrode and Anna Maria von Wylich can be found. These epitaphs were made in 1680/81 and were originally in another Herten church. When the chapel moved from Grimberg to Herten, the two decorated sarcophagi of Heinrich Knipping (‚Ä† 1578) and his wife Sybilla von Nesselrode (‚Ä† 1602) were also relocated. They can be found within the chapel. = The castle's park = The ruins of the orangery The \\"Tabakhaus\\" Originally a French formal garden, the castle's park was modified into an English landscape garden between 1814 and 1817. While doing so, the D√ºsseldorf garden architect Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe kept elements of the symmetrical Baroque garden, for example some avenues and the orangery. The hedge maze no longer exists, but the open-air theater was reconstructed in a reduced form and is now used again for drama group performances. Between the mid-19th century and the First World War, the castle's owners laid out two fish ponds and a mixed forest of approximately 200 hectares (500 acres). Furthermore, two buildings for employees at the northern entrance of the castle grounds were built during that time. When the Regional Association of Westphalia-Lippe () stepped in to save the castle from total collapse in 1974, the park had also been neglected for over 50 years and looked accordingly. The restoration of the park lasted until 1982, at which time the park was opened to the public. About half of its roughly 30 hectares (75 acres) are woods, five hectares are lawns and the rest are water and paths. According to castle park information, 3,067 trees from over 300 species can be found in the park, among them rare species such as a 125-year-old Chinese handkerchief tree, a Japanese bigleaf magnolia and an American lily- of-the-valley tree. These exotic plants were brought to Herten by the castle's former owners upon returning from diplomatic missions in distant countries. Due to its botanic diversity the park was awarded the status of a cultural monument in 1988. ; Orangery In 1725, a one-story Neo-Renaissance orangery was built at the northern end of the northern castle garden (today known as the \\"Narzissenwiese\\", daffodil lawn). The front of ten windows was crowned by a balustrade with twelve life-sized sandstone statues representing figures of Greek mythology. The building was not only used for wintering sensitive plants, but also as a garden social venue and dining room. While being functional, the orangery was also home to one of Germany's most famous collections of Japanese camellia. Today, the building is only a ruin. ; Tobacco House A square garden pavilion in the eastern part of the park is called \\"Tabakhaus\\" (tobacco house) and commemorates two counts of Riaucourt who were sons of a countess of Nesselrode and fled to Herten when the French Revolution swept through their home country. While living in Herten, the two counts smoked tobacco in the \\"Tabakhaus\\" since it was regarded as a new- fashioned sin and not permitted in the main castle. The \\"Tabakhaus\\" is a small Louis Seize-style brick building with a mansard roof. Private fundraising made the restoration possible.  Today's Use  The main castle today is a venue for numerous cultural events, for example the international Klavierfestival Ruhr and the Herten castle concerts. Every year at whitsun, the castle's park hosts a two-day arts and crafts market including several performances. The castle houses a caf√© with two rooms in the northern wing. During summer there is seating also on the wooden bridge across the moat. It is possible to have civil weddings in the castle. The vaulted castle basement contains an exhibition by the German \\"Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union\\" NGO showcasing the flora and fauna of the park. The carriage house is used as a social center and day hospital of the adjacent psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic run by the Regional Association of Westphalia-Lippe.

Biography  Joan Comas Pausas was born in Vilafranca del Pened√®s in Barcelona Province, Catalonia, Spain. He was the son of Antonio Comas Torregrosa and Josefa Pausas Rovira. Orphaned at the age of fourteen, he moved to Barcelona where he became interested in fine arts: painting, drawing and antiquities. Barcelona was the city where he developed artistically. He attended drawing lessons with the painter Juan Lahosa at Baixas Academy.Lina Font, Gu√≠a del Arte 1/1982, p. 158. Lu√≠s Porcel, Barcelona. Comas-Pausas worked in a men‚Äôs outfitter as an apprentice until 1944 when he went back to Vilafranca and opened his own business. From 1961 he worked also as a freelance technical architect, after finishing the appropriate studies. In those years Comas-Pausas could only spend a little time on his favourite hobby - painting. Nevertheless, in 1955 he received a prize for an oil painting on a panel. He continued to train on his own and his work was distributed privately. It was not until 1976 that he began to exhibit his work in public, mainly using watercolour. In this same year, as part of the celebration of the \\"Centenary of Hiking in Catalonia\\", Comas-Pausas exhibited 27 watercolours in Vilafranca Museum. A critic thus described the painting of Comas-Pausas: \\"Comas' landscapes ooze light; and only the sensitivity of a person that loves nature can combine with such fidelity the shades of what forms the essence of our countryside - that lonely little church, the human element that year by year becomes part of the landscape, the loneliness of the Pyrenean lakes, dead nature (paradoxically full of life) in dry trees killed by the storms, or the outburst of colour in plants and rocks. And above it all, those gloomy or serenely cloudy skies, a kaleidoscope that we ramblers are used to contemplating, and that Comas-Pausas knows so well how to reflect\\".Butllet√≠ del Centre Excursionista del Pened√®s, January‚ÄìFebruary 1977. Vilafranca del Pened√®s.  Technique  In his oil paintings, Comas-Pausas preferred indoor subjects with figures. In watercolour, the method in which he came to specialise, he painted landscapes, seascapes and urban scenes. His watercolours closely follow the traditional schools of Catalan landscape painting. The painting is descriptive and easy to read, the composition carefully worked out, the range of colours harmonious and nuanced, all the result of a thrilled sensitivity to nature. The tonal range is adapted to the varying atmosphere and light of the paintings. Comas- Pausas also painted urban themes, mainly in Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria and the Netherlands, and visited art galleries to study the pictorial works.  Exhibitions  He exhibited privately in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, Vilafranca del Pened√®s, Olot, Martorell, Ripoll, Molins de Rei, Igualada, El Vendrell, Begues and Barcelona (at Mayte Mu√±oz gallery and at the Technical Architects Association). As a member of the Watercolour Association of Catalonia, he participated in every collective exhibition of this Association from 1977 to 1989 in Barcelona (Palau de la Virreina, Palau Reial de Pedralbes, Antiguo Hospital de la Santa Cruz and Banco de Bilbao), Terrassa, Vilafranca (Museum), and Lleida (Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Ilerdencs). He was selected to represent the Association in the National Watercolour Exhibition in Bilbao in 1984.Catalogue of the National Watercolour Exhibition. Bilbao, 1984. Page 60. He also participated in other collective exhibitions in Olot, Ledesma (Salamanca) and Vilafranca. The shows in Vilafranca included one in 1985 with five other artists in the Forum Berger Balaguer, and later \\"Painting and Sculpture in Vilafranca 1900-1999\\". On the occasion of the centenary of his birth in 2013, there was a retrospective exhibition in the Forum Berger Balaguer in Vilafranca del Pened√®s. His work is found in pr√≠vate collections in Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Museum of Vilafranca.

In Great Britain, such uniformity had been adopted as a necessary prelude to the issue, in May 1840, of the world's first adhesive postage stamps, to be used for the prepayment of mail. (Before this standardization, the many different postal rates in different jurisdictions had made fees too unpredictable to prepay all letters with stamps as a matter of course, with the result that recipients of letters‚Äîrather than senders‚Äîgenerally paid the postage on them.) It was clearly Britain‚Äôs standardization that led the U.S. Congress to do likewise in 1845; but while preliminary versions of the Act of March 3 also dealt with the possibility of issuing stamps, the law finally enacted did not authorize the U.S. Post office to do so. Local postmasters, however, now realized that uniform rates made it practical for them to issue postage stamps of their own for pre-payment of mail; and between 1845 and 1847 such Postmasters' Provisional stamps were sold in eleven United States municipalities. The first provisionals issued were those of New York and Baltimore, which appeared on July 14 and 15, 1845; New Haven and St. Louis issues appeared later that year. The remaining seven jurisdictions apparently all introduced their stamps in 1846. Examples of the eleven provisional issues are shown below.

Five were printed in sheets from engraving plates: :*New York (steel-plate; forty subjects) :*Baltimore (twelve subjects: nine 5¬¢ stamps, three 10¬¢ stamps) (Note: Baltimore also employed three handstamps of the \\"James M. Buchanan\\" signature to imprint indicia on envelopes. The signature is not that of the future president, but of his cousin: James Madison Buchanan, the Postmaster of Baltimore.) :*Brattleboro (copperplate, ten subjects) :*Providence (copperplate, twelve subjects: eleven 5¬¢ stamps, one 10¬¢ stamp) :*St. Louis (copperplate, six subjects: three 5¬¢ stamps, three 10¬¢ stamps; plate later modified [1846] to produce one 5¬¢ stamp, three 10¬¢ stamps and two 20¬¢ stamps). Two provisional issues were typeset: :*Alexandria (two subjects) :*Boscawen. The Millbury stamp was printed from a woodcut; the New Haven and Lockport issues were handstamped; the Annapolis provisional was an indicium printed on an envelope. The rarest of the provisionals, known in but a single copy, are those of Boscawen and Lockport. Unique as well is the Alexandria \\"Blue Boy\\" variant, the only surviving example printed on blue paper. According to census data supplied by Siegel Auctions, only six additional copies of the Alexandria Provisional are known, all on buff-colored paper. Notably rare as well are the provisionals of Annapolis (2 copies extant), New Haven (11 copies) and Millbury (19 copies). Baltimore 10¬¢ labels are also scarce (7 copies). Five hundred copies of the Brattleboro issue were produced, but only 52 are known. Providence printed at least 5,500 5¬¢ stamps and 500 10¬¢ stamps. The first two printings of the St. Louis provisional produced 2,000 5¬¢ stamps, 3,000 10¬¢ stamps and 1,000 20¬¢ stamps; the final printing probably added 1,500 5¬¢ stamps and 1,500 10¬¢ stamps, making a grand total of 9,000 provisionals produced. Among the eleven provisionals, the New York issue was produced in the largest quantity by far, with 143,600 stamps delivered to the New York Post Office.The Frelinghuysen Collection, Sale 1020, Siegel Auction Galleries, March 28, 2012. The national U. S. stamps introduced on July 1, 1847 essentially conformed to the design features of the New York Postmaster's provisional‚Äînot surprisingly, given that both the provisional and national issues were designed and printed by the same New York firm (Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson). With the issue of stamps for nationwide use, postmasters' provisionals became obsolete‚Äîhaving played, however, an appreciable role in accustoming the public to the use of stamps for prepaying postal fees.

On the floor of the church, the headstones of the old abbots are visible. In side chapels, there are two graves. One, dating to the 13th century, is believed to correspond to Guillem, Earl Osona and brother of Ramon Berenguer I, who, after waiving his rights, was a monk of Sant Miquel. The other tomb may be that of Andreu Arbizu, a monk from Navarre, who provided goods to the monastery. The old priory house style is Gothic and dates to the 15th century.

Journal of Visualized Experiments. 47. 2011. Microfluidics Hydrodynamic trapping is advantageous in microfluidics. Other trapping devices utilize acoustic, electric, magnetic, and optical fields for trapping. This device uses solely hydrodynamic flow. Since it does not utilize acoustic, electric, magnetic, or optical fields, the particles being studied do not need to possess chemical or physical characteristics that cater to these fields. Instead, hydrodynamic trapping is universal and can be used on any particles. Hydrodynamic traps are able to confine small nanoparticles. This is because the hydrodynamic trapping force is closely related to radius of a particle, whereas alternate trapping methods are more closely related to volume of a particle. These traps are stable and they allow for precise control of environmental factors. This means that if a specific nanoparticle in a solution is desired for study, this nanoparticle can be trapped in concentrated sample suspensions. The surrounding medium in the trap can be easily controlled. In addition to the previously mentioned advantages of using hydrodynamic trapping, hydrodynamic trapping is also a relatively low cost trapping method, and it is very easy to use and analyze. It is also simple and inexpensive to incorporate into existing soft lithography based microfluidic systems. =Devices= The first step in creating the microfluidic devices used for hydrodynamic trapping is to create an SU-8 mold. From this mold, a device can be made from PDMS. A completed device consists of two layers, a control layer and a fluidic layer. The control layer contains a valve to regulate the flow of the aqueous solution under study. The fluidic layer contains the channels for the aqueous solution to travel through. Many devices have a cross slot where two opposing laminar streams converge. This creates planar extensional flow with a point where velocity becomes zero, which is known as the fluid stagnation point. Upon analyzing a fluid with beads, DNA, or other very small particles under a microscope, the trajectories of the particles and the stagnation point can be determined. =Biomedical applications= Microfluidic hydrodynamic has up and coming applications in medicine, especially in point of care diagnostics. Hydrodynamic trapping allows isolation of a target cell from an aqueous mixture. Several advantages exist for the use of hydrodynamic trapping as a separation technique, including: higher processing rates, less use of samples, better spatial resolution, and cost efficiency. The way target cells are separated in a solution depends on several types of effects. The first is inertial effects. The inertia in laminar flow can cause cross streamline migration of particles in solution. The inertial effects are related to the Reynold's number. Another effect is viscoelastic focusing in non-Newtonian fluids. This effect accounts for directions of migration in different particles and is based on properties of polymeric fluids. Another effect is deformability of a particle. This can lead to deformability-selective cell separation. This technique is especially useful to identify cancerous cells, which are more deformable than healthy cells from the same part of the body. Another method is vorticity induced trapping. This is especially useful for high throughput situations and situations where there is a large difference between the target cells or particles and the other particles in a solution. The vortices can be created by modifying the geometry of channels.Karimi, A., S. Yazdi, and A. M. Ardekani. \\"Hydrodynamic Mechanisms Of Cell And Particle Trapping In Microfluidics.\\" Biomicrofluidics 7.2 (2013): 021501-021501-23. =Lipid bilayers= Hydrodynamic trapping can also be used to trap and study molecules in lipid bilayers. This is done using hydrodynamic drag forces that are created by a fluid flow through a very small cone shaped pipet located about one micrometer away from the lipid bilayer. This allows particles protruding from the lipid bilayer to be trapped and studied.Peter J√∂nsson, James McColl, Richard W. Clarke, Victor P. Ostanin, Bengt J√∂nsson, and David Klenerman; Hydrodynamic trapping of molecules in lipid bilayers. PNAS 2012 109 (26) 10328-10333. Mineral trapping Hydrodynamic trapping can be used on a more macroscopic scale for mineral trapping. It can be used to store CO2 in geothermal reservoirs. Geothermal energy can result in large emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. Hydronamic trapping allows CO2 to be converted into CaCO3. CaCO3 is geochemically stable.Michael K√ºhn, Helge Stanjek, Stefan Peiffer, Christoph Clauser, Mineral Trapping of CO2 in Operated Geothermal Reservoirs ‚Äì Numerical Simulations on Various Scales, Energy Procedia, Volume 40, 2013.

Hansen (born September 21, 1921) is an American artist best known for neo-expressionist figurative paintings that feature the flora and fauna of the Palouse, a geographically unusual area in Eastern Washington state where he lives and works, and ‚Äúthe Kernal,‚Äù Hansen's alter-ego frontiersman whose often-perilous adventures are depicted in many of the artist's canvases. Hansen's paintings have been exhibited in museums and galleries in Seattle, Los Angeles, New York, Berlin, Beijing, and Singapore, and are held in numerous public and private collections. Hansen has received several prestigious awards, including the Flintridge Foundation Awards for Visual Artists in 2001. Between 2007 and 2010, Hansen was the subject of a traveling retrospective exhibition, titled \\"Gaylen Hansen: Three Decades of Paintings.\\" Hansen served on the faculty at Washington State University in Pullman, WA from 1957 to 1982.  Early life and education  Gaylen Hansen was born in Garland, Utah in 1921. During the mid-1800s, Hansen's family traveled west with Mormon pioneers to escape religious persecution. They settled in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, then a wild and uncultivated wilderness. Until World War II, horses were used by the Mormons to farm the rugged land, demanding work that young Gaylen said he was ‚Äúmade for.\\" Hansen rode saddle horses and worked with cows, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, cats, geese, ducks, chickens and pigeons. All would turn up again later in Hansen's paintings. Until 1927, Hansen lived with his parents in Salt Lake City and Ogden, Utah. Following his parents‚Äô divorce, Hansen and his brother, Arthur, returned to Garland to live on an organic farm owned by his mother's parents. Hansen's mother, Verna (Whalen) Hansen, a dressmaker who enjoyed grand opera and art, soon moved to Los Angeles, California to secure employment. While at the farm, Hansen began drawing images ‚Äúbased on illustrations in The Saturday Evening Post.‚Äù Hansen's grandfather discouraged Gaylen's interest in art. However, his father, Neils M. Hansen, a Harvard University-educated engineer who was wiped out during the Great Depression in 1929, had illustrated a self-penned book about his outdoor adventures and encouraged his son's budding interest. In 1938, Hansen moved to Salt Lake City during his senior year of high school to care for Neils, who was stricken with cancer. During that period, Gaylen and a classmate, Frank Bacher, painted watercolors by the Jordan River. Neils died in the same year. In 1939, Hansen moved to Los Angeles to live with his mother and enrolled at the Otis Art Institute, a training institution for young artists who aspired to careers in academia. Hansen returned to Salt Lake City in 1940 to work in a sign shop with Frank Bacher. They continued to paint together, doing ‚Äúvarious kinds of modern painting.‚Äù Later that year, Bacher moved to New York City and Hansen attended the Art Barn School of Fine Arts in Salt Lake City, where he also taught a figure drawing class. In 1943, Hansen moved to New York City to study art and viewed works by modern artists including Henri Rousseau, Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, Marsden Hartley, and Matta Echaurren. The next year, he returned to Salt Lake City and married Shirley Anderson. Hansen volunteered for military duty but was classified 4-F (‚Äúunfit for duty‚Äù) by the U.S. Army Air Corps because of troubling x-ray results. Instead, Hansen studied airplane engine mechanics and worked at Hill Field Air Base in Ogden. In 1945, Hansen enrolled in the University of Utah. The following year, he attended Utah State College in Logan on an art scholarship. In 1952, Hansen earned a B.S. degree at Utah State College. Also in 1952, Hansen commenced graduate studies at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. He completed a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in 1953.  Teaching career (1940-1982)  In 1940, Hansen taught his first art class, figure drawing, at the Art Barn School of Fine Arts in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1947, prior to earning his B.S. degree from Utah State College, Hansen became an instructor at the University of Texas, Austin, where he taught until 1952. From 1954 to 1957, Hansen taught at Yakima Valley College in Yakima, Washington, where he also supervised the Larson Gallery. In 1957, Hansen moved Pullman, Washington to teach at Washington State University (WSU). Hansen retired from teaching at WSU in 1982. = Students = Cartoonist Gary Larson, creator of The Far Side, a single-panel cartoon series, was a student of Hansen's at WSU. Larson contributed ‚ÄúA Cartoonist Deconstructs an Artist: Here Goes Nothin‚Äô!‚Äù for the book ‚ÄúGaylen Hansen: Three Decades of Painting,‚Äù published in conjunction with a Hansen retrospective exhibition of the same name. Larson wrote: Other Hansen students who became ‚Äúserious and respected artists‚Äù include Ken Cory, Jack Dollhausen, Robert Helm, Les LePere, and Patrick Siler. Dollhausen, Helm, and Siler also took teaching positions at WSU.  Formative experiences  During the neo-expressionist boom of the 1970s, Gaylen Hansen came to the attention art world. His signature style was influenced by important 20th Century artists, art movements, and personal and cultural events. = 1940s = During his teaching tenure at the University of Austin during the 1940s, Hansen said he painted in a range of styles: ‚ÄúMondrian, Picasso, Paul Klee, plus realistic still lifes and drawings.‚Äù While in Austin, Hansen viewed paintings by Jackson Pollock and attended a lecture by Thomas Hart Benton. Hansen married his first wife, Shirley Anderson, in 1944. = 1950s = Between 1953 and 1954, Hansen worked as an illustrator at the Hancock Foundation at USC and made ‚Äúfish drawings‚Äù for a scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Later, Hansen noted that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm capable of quite good realism, believe it or not. I was a very accomplished draftsman, know anatomy thoroughly, could draw and articulate the figure well.‚Äù While teaching at Yakima Valley College during the mid-1950s, Hansen met artist Roy De Forest, who would inherit Hansen's teaching position. Hansen credited De Forest, known for his comic-like depictions of dogs, with turning ‚Äúmy head around to a different angle of perception.‚Äù Hansen later reflected that during the 1950s he ‚Äúcontinued slugging it out with abstract expressionism, learning more what it was about but at the same time wondering why I was doing it.‚Äù = 1960s = Between 1962 and 1964, Hansen developed a working relationship with Canadian graduate student Iain Baxter (now a noted conceptual artist) at WSU. Hansen and Baxter explored many art movements, including the work of Italian artist Giorgio Morandi, who obsessively arranged and rearranged the same ordinary objects for his canvases. Hansen described his and Baxter's investigations: Hansen's wife Shirley (Anderson) Hansen died in 1963. In 1965, Hansen married Patricia Cassidy. During a sabbatical from WSU in 1966 and 1967, Hansen and Patricia visited Stinson Beach, California, 10 miles north of San Francisco. Hansen was exposed to Bay Area hippie counterculture and impressed by the work of such rising stars in the art world as Wayne Thiebaud, Robert Crumb, Robert Arneson, William T. Wiley, and ‚Äúpsychedelic artist‚Äù Peter Max. Hansen returned to Pullman with highly patterned paintings influenced by California funk art, Op art, and underground comix. Many of the paintings featured arrangements of bent legs clad in colorful striped stockings. A former colleague, Robert Ecker, said Hansen, who ‚Äústruggled with his Mormon youth all the time, was a convert to the 1960s‚Äù by the time he returned from his sabbatical. Also during the 1960s, Hansen was introduced to the work of experimental American composer John Cage, whose explorations of chance and ambient sounds strongly influenced the artist. = 1970s = In 1970, Hansen and wife Patricia moved into an old log roadhouse outside of Pullman, which he christened the ‚ÄúCountry Club.‚Äù The couple shared the Country Club with chickens, dogs, and ducks, and planted thousands of tulip bulbs. Hansen began his Fort Bentleg series of canvases, ‚Äúpainting scenes from around the place‚Ä¶I really felt quite free of the usual concerns ‚Äì whether [the paintings] were contemporary or avant-garde, which at the time were still considered important issues.‚Äù Hansen depicted the Country Club enclosed by walls adorned with hearts and surrounded by dog-headed mountains. In Hansen's paintings, the Country Club was inhabited by a bearded pipe- smoking figure who would become the prototype for ‚Äúthe Kernal,‚Äù Hansen's alter ego. Hansen also began to make paintings of the Kernal going on long journeys. Later, Hansen said ‚Äúthe psychology of separation and the rustic country feel of the place slanted my work toward a kind of folk or primitive appearance.‚Äù During the mid-1970s, Hansen concluded that he was not destined to connect with ‚Äúmodern art or New York or any kind of mainstream developments.‚Äù He decided that he ‚Äúmight as well do what amused me primarily. Prior to that I had been concerned about the rest of the art world.‚Äù Hansen recalled that his work ‚Äúbegan to take on a more distinctive and personal look around 1975. However some of the earlier basic concepts and methods persisted, and still do.‚Äù = 1980s = In 1982, Hansen and wife Patricia divorced. Also in 1982, while working as a visiting artist at the Banff School of Fine Arts in Alberta, Canada, Hansen met Heidi Oberheide, a visiting artist from Newfoundland, who was teaching printmaking. They married in 1984. In 1985, Hansen's first retrospective exhibition, ‚ÄúGaylen Hansen: The Paintings of a Decade, 1975-1985,‚Äù was presented at the Museum of Art at WSU in Pullman, WA and other art institutions. For the catalog that accompanied the exhibition, co-curator Bruce Guenther wrote:  Subjects and themes  For four decades, Gaylen Hansen has animated his paintings with subjects drawn from his intimate relationship with the Palouse, a peculiar landscape of humps and hollows that were sculpted by prehistoric dust storms. In his Eastern Washington studio, Hansen summons familiar flora, fauna, and favorite objects to his canvases, including dogs, tulips, trout, grasshoppers, magpies, moons, work gloves, bison, bulls, bears, and ducks. However, Hansen depicts and arranges his recurring subjects in a manner uniquely his own. In Hansen's paintings, a trout takes wing with a flock of ducks; a minivan-sized grasshopper perches on a sofa; a bison, a trout, and a tulip stand on end at equal heights in a neat row; and giant gleaming moons light the way, or deepen dread. A frequent traveler among these odd ensembles is a bearded character Hansen calls ‚Äúthe Kernal,‚Äù often described as the artist's alter-ego, or Everyman figure. The Kernal, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Hansen, is usually shown in profile, seemingly aloof to the curious circumstances unfolding about him. Thus Hansen's images are more a reflection of his ‚Äúinterior landscape‚Äù than the literal objects he depicts. In a 2007 interview, Hansen recalled how ancient Egyptian and Persian miniature art influenced his narrative style: For the \\"Gaylen C. Hansen\\" exhibition at the Glowbow Museum in 1979, art curator Peter White wrote: In 1985, Hansen embraced characterizations of his expressionistic work as na√Øve: Over time, Hansen's work has become increasingly ‚Äúimmediate and spontaneous, with a looser, more painterly feel.‚Äù Hansen also acknowledges using humor in his work ‚Äúas a way of dealing with the seriousness of it all‚Ä¶It tickles me when our usual, rational side is challenged in some way. Particularly within a painting where it‚Äôs not going to harm anybody.‚Äù Art curator Peter White described the \\"humanizing\\" effect of humor in Hansen's \\"grand\\" works: Hansen's paintings can also veer away from humor toward ‚Äúdark extremes of desperation and fear.‚Äù In a 2013 exhibit, Hansen's dogs, often humorous subjects in his paintings, displayed a very different character. In her review of the exhibit, The Seattle Times art critic and professor Gayle Clemans wrote: In 1979, art curator Peter White observed: = The Palouse = Since 1957, Hansen has lived in a geographically-odd area in Eastern Washington known as the Palouse. The other- worldly quality of the Palouse landscape and indigenous elements within it imbue Hansen's paintings with ‚Äúthe potential for magic and transformation.‚Äù Hansen comments on the importance of the Palouse in his work: ‚ÄúPaintings that don‚Äôt work don‚Äôt have a sense of place.‚Äù Nevertheless, Hansen says his depictions of the Palouse do not ‚Äúrely too much on the natural order of things.‚Äù A bountiful agricultural area, the Palouse is marked by its distinctive topography of virtually bald hills, a geographical feature said to be found in only one other place in the world. According to art curator Peter White, the Palouse landscape resembles an uneven ripple pattern, which contributes to a ‚Äúdistortion of spatial values.‚Äù White noted that a ‚Äúsoftened and generalized light‚Äù in the region adds to an ‚Äúambiguity of perspective.‚Äù Against this backdrop, White observed, ‚Äúobjects stand out in sharp relief and outline.‚Äù In an undated note, Hansen wrote, ‚ÄúOpen space in [the Palouse] has a direct relationship with the way I react to the space in paintings. That is, whatever features there are stand out dramatically.‚Äù Peter White wrote:  Hanford Nuclear Reservation  In 1998, author and art critic Matthew Kangas wrote that Hansen's paintings reveal the artist's concerns about a natural environment under siege: The Palouse lies 150 miles northeast of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, a 586-square-mile shrub-steppe desert. Between 1943 and 1987, the Hanford site was used to produce plutonium for the bomb that brought World War II to an end, and to meet potential threats during the Cold War. Weapons production processes left solid and liquid wastes that posed a risk to the local environment. A federal effort to clean up the Hanford site began in 1989. = The Kernal = While on a sabbatical leave in California from WSU in the 1960s, Hansen drew a cartoon-like figure of a bent leg with black and white stripes that would evolve into a favorite recurring subject, which he called ‚Äúthe Kernal.‚Äù The Kernal and Fort Bentleg may have been inspired in part by Hansen's readings of the journals of American explorers Lewis and Clark, and his wonderment of ‚Äúa time when you could be surprised by nature.‚Äù Hansen has commented that the Kernal's resemblance to the artist was not deliberate: Hansen has described the state of the Kernal's impassive countenance as ‚Äúsuspend time,‚Äù in which the Kernal does not react to the environment around him: In 1987, Los Angeles Times art critic Suzanne Muchnic wrote that Hansen uses the Kernal as a device to insulate viewers from \\"a tension about this art--a rickety balance of nature and man-against-beast\\":  Methods  Hansen eschews stretcher bars, easels, and picture frames in his work. Instead, he staples blank canvases to a wall in his studio and tears them down when done painting them. According to art curator Peter White, the canvases‚Äô tattered edges lend them a ‚Äúfeeling of remnants from another civilization.‚Äù Hansen often works on more than one painting at a time. If Hansen is displeased with a painting, he may discard it upside down atop other spurned paintings on the floor of his studio, or burn it in his yard. Many of Hansen's canvases are large-scale works. A Hansen painting in the Seattle Art Museum Collection, ‚ÄúFish in a Landscape‚Äù (1979), measures 72 1/4 inches x 168 inches. Hansen has painted similar paintings with oil and acrylic paints to compare the different qualities of the two mediums.  Exhibitions  Gaylen Hansen's work has been widely exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in the United States and internationally. = Museums and institutions = From 1985 to 1987, a retrospective exhibition, \\"Gaylen Hansen: The Paintings of a Decade, 1975-1985,\\" was presented at the Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, WA; University Art Museum, Pullman, WA; Boise Gallery of Art, Boise, ID; Galerie Redmann, Berlin, Germany; Museum of Art, Pennsylvania State University, Pennsylvania, PA; Portland Center for the Visual Arts, Portland, OR; and San Jose Museum of Art, San Jose, CA. The exhibition also travelled to the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery in Barnsdall Art Park and the Koplin Gallery. In 1999, a traveling exhibition, titled ‚ÄúWild Beasts!‚Äù, featured paintings by Hansen and Roy De Forest, which were described as ‚Äúirreverent and humorous visual narratives based on [the artists‚Äô] lives and experiences in the American West.‚Äù Organized by the Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art in Great Falls, MT, the exhibition was presented at Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art; Yellowstone Art Museum, Billings, MT; Museum of Northwest Art, La Conner, WA; and Schneider Museum of Art, Ashland, OR. In 2007 and 2008, Hansen was the subject of \\"Gaylen Hansen: Three Decades of Paintings,‚Äù a retrospective exhibition organized by the Museum of Art at Washington State University (WSU). The exhibition was presented at Museum of Art at WSU, Pullman WA; Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, Spokane, WA; Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, WA; Salt Lake Art Center, Salt Lake City, UT; and the Missoula Art Museum, Missoula, MT. In 2010, the exhibition was presented at the Maui Arts and Cultural Center in Maui, HI. = Galleries = Gallery exhibitions of Hansen's paintings were presented at Otto Seligman Gallery, Seattle, WA (1959); Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, WA (1959); University of Idaho, Moscow, ID (1966); Spokane Art Center, Spokane, WA (1967); University of Colorado, Boulder, CO (1972); Fine Arts Center, Washington State University, Pullman, WA (1967, 1972, 1975, 1977); Spokane Falls Community College Art Gallery, Spokane, WA (1980); Manolides Gallery, Seattle, WA (1977, 1976, 1981); Glenbow Museum, Calgary, Alberta, Canada (1981); Monique Knowlton Gallery, New York, NY (1980, 1981, 1983, 1987, 1990, 1992, 1994); and LewAllen Galleries, Santa Fe, NM (2000).

Contemporary Arts, New York, NY (2003); and Stremmel Gallery, Reno, NV (2010‚ÄìPresent). International exhibitions of Hansen's work have been presented in Berlin, Jakarta, Singapore, and Beijing.  Recognition  In 2002, Hansen was given a Flintridge Foundation Award for Visual Artists for ‚Äúserious continued artistic exploration and the development of a distinctive artistic voice that can be identified in the artists‚Äô work dating back 20-plus years.‚Äù In 1990, Hansen received the Washington State Governor‚Äôs Arts Award, presented by Gov.

In 1902, Arthur Koppel, acting as agent, imported a single 0-6-0 narrow gauge tank steam locomotive for a customer in Durban. It was then purchased by the Cape Government Railways and used as construction locomotive on the Avontuur branch from 1903. In 1912, this locomotive was assimilated into the South African Railways and in 1917 it was sent to German South West Africa during the First World War campaign in that territory.Classification of S.A.R.

(1944). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter II - The Cape Government Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, April 1944. pp. 253-257. Manufacturer A single locomotive, built by Krauss & Company in 1902, was imported in 1902 by Arthur Koppel, acting as agent. It was purchased by the Cape Government Railways (CGR) and placed in service from 1903 as construction locomotive on the narrow gauge Avontuur branch out of Port Elizabeth, where it was colloquially known as the Koppel engine. The locomotive was a Krauss type XXVIIab with works number 4830, which was unique in South Africa. It appears to be identical to half a Zwillinge, the twin Feldbahn locomotives built by the same firm and others for the Swakopmund- Windhuk Staatsbahn in German South West Africa, except that the cab was enclosed at the rear. The engine had outside Stephenson valve gear and was a coal burner, fitted with a balloon chimney to accommodate a spark arrester.Schmeiser, Bernard (1977). Krauss-Lokomotiven.

After completion of the Avontuur line, the locomotive was retained in service since it could haul three passenger coaches more economically than a petrol railcar. =South African Railways= When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (CGR, Natal Government Railways and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. When it came onto the roster of the South African Railways (SAR) in 1912, the locomotive was numbered NG21, with the letters NG identifying it as a narrow gauge locomotive in the SAR registers. =First World War= In 1915, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, the German South West Africa colony was occupied by the Union Defence Forces. Since a large part of the territory's railway infrastructure was destroyed or damaged by retreating German forces, an urgent need arose for locomotives for use on the narrow gauge lines in that territory. In 1917, no. NG21 was transferred to the Defence Department for service in South West Africa. It did not return to South Africa after the war and was withdrawn from service in 1918.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development.

The first internet puzzle started on January 4, 2012 on 4chan and ran for nearly a month. A second round began one year later on January 4, 2013, and then a third round following the confirmation of a fresh clue posted on Twitter on January 4, 2014. The third puzzle has yet to be solved. The stated intent was to recruit \\"intelligent individuals\\" by presenting a series of puzzles which were to be solved. No new puzzles were published on January 4, 2015. However, a new clue was posted on Twitter on January 5, 2016. In April 2017, a verified PGP-signed message was found. It explicitly denies the validity of any unsigned puzzle. A verified puzzle has not been posted since. The puzzles focused heavily on data security, cryptography, steganography, and internet anonymity. It has been called \\"the most elaborate and mysterious puzzle of the internet age\\" and is listed as one of the \\"top 5 eeriest, unsolved mysteries of the internet\\", and much speculation exists as to its function. Many have speculated that the puzzles are a recruitment tool for the NSA, CIA, MI6, a \\"Masonic conspiracy\\" or a cyber mercenary group. Others have claimed Cicada 3301 is an alternate reality game. However, no company or individual has taken credit for it or attempted to monetize it. Purpose The stated purpose of the puzzles each year has been to recruit \\"highly intelligent individuals\\", although the ultimate purpose remains unknown. Some have claimed that Cicada 3301 is a secret society with the goal of improving cryptography, privacy and anonymity. Others have claimed that Cicada 3301 is a cult or religion. According to statements of several people who won the 2012 puzzle, 3301 typically uses non-puzzle-based recruiting methods, but created the Cicada puzzles because they were looking for potential members with cryptography and computer security skills. Resolution The first puzzle, of 2012, has been solved by Marcus Wanner. According to him, those who solved the puzzles were asked questions about their support of information freedom, online privacy and freedom, and rejection of censorship. Those who answered satisfactorily at this stage were invited to a private forum, where they were instructed to devise and complete a project intended to further the ideals of the group. He did not finish his work on a method of general decryption and the website was removed. =Types of clues= Locations of the physical paper signs from the 2012 puzzle The Cicada 3301 clues have spanned many different communication media, including the internet, telephone, original music, bootable Linux CDs, digital images, physical paper signs, and pages of unpublished cryptic books written in runes. One book, titled Liber Primus, literally \\"first book\\", contains many pages, only some of which have been decrypted. In addition to using many varying techniques to encrypt, encode, or hide data, these clues also have referenced a wide variety of books, poetry, artwork and music. Each clue has been signed by the same OpenPGP private key to confirm authenticity. Allegations against the group =Allegations of illegal activity= Authorities from the Los Andes Province of Chile claim that Cicada 3301 is a \\"hacker group\\" and engaged in illegal activities. Cicada 3301 responded to this claim by issuing a PGP-signed statement denying any involvement in illegal activity. In July 2015, a group calling themselves \\"3301\\" hacked into Planned Parenthood's database; however, the group appears to have no association to Cicada 3301. Cicada 3301 later issued a PGP-signed statement stating they \\"are not associated with this group in any way\\" and also stated that Cicada 3301 does not \\"condone their use of our name, number, or symbolism\\". The hacker group later confirmed that they are not affiliated with Cicada 3301. =Claims of being a cult= As the group has gained notoriety and public attention, many have asserted that the puzzles are an introduction to occult principles, and possibly even recruitment for a cult. Tim Dailey, a senior research fellow with the conservative Christian Family Research Council, analyzed the teachings of Cicada 3301, and stated, \\"The enigmatic Cicada 3301 appears to be drawing participants inexorably into the dark web of the occult √† la Blavatsky and Crowley. At the heart of the enchantment is the counterfeit promise of ultimate meaning through self- divination.\\" Others have claimed that the Cicada 3301 puzzles are a modern and technological equivalent to the enlightenment journey within Western esotericism and Mystery schools. In popular culture The United States Navy released a cryptographic challenge based on the Cicada 3301 recruitment puzzles in 2014 calling it Project Architeuthis. The plot of \\"Nautilus\\", the September 30, 2014 episode of the TV show Person of Interest, featured a large-scale game very similar to the Cicada 3301 puzzles. Both feature a series of worldwide cryptographic puzzles, but as the title implies, these feature the image of a nautilus shell instead of a cicada logo. Person of Interest creator Jonathan Nolan and producer Greg Plageman stated in an interview that Cicada 3301 was the inspiration for the episode: \\"Episode 2, I'm particularly fascinated by the subject underneath it. Look up Cicada 3301 on the internet. It's a very interesting concept out there that we then put into a larger story that connects to our show.\\" The organization is the subject of an upcoming comedy-thriller film of the same name, which was announced in 2018. Directed by Alan Ritchson, who co-wrote the script with Joshua Montcalm, it stars Jack Kesy, Ron Funches, Conor Leslie, Andreas Apergis, and Ritchson. The film was acquired by Grindstone Entertainment Group in 2020, which will release the film digitally. Music There were two pieces of music, titled 'the Instar Emergence' and 'Interconnectedness,' accompanying the Cicada clues. However, none of them were part of a standard repertoire, and neither the composers nor performers has been identified. Certain patterns have emerged that indicate that the music itself may be a clue and that Cicada is attempting to establish a musical cryptogram in parallel with its other embedded information. TechGeek365 analyzed the structure of a number of the pieces and discovered that there are certain dyads (two notes sounding simultaneous), which, when corresponded with letters and numbers, reveal hidden messages. Artists Rick Steff and Roy Berry of the band Lucero included a Cicada 3301-inspired song on their side-project album Superfluidity. The music video, directed by Charlie Fasano, featured artwork taken from the Liber Primus book by Cicada 3301.

He led the initial investigation into the Great Train Robbery in 1963. Early life Fewtrell was born in Ryde, on the Isle of Wight, where his father was a police officer. He attended Reading School, then spent 6 months in New South Wales, Australia working as a jackaroo on sheep stations. He then returned to the UK and became a police cadet with the Buckinghamshire Constabulary in 1927. Three of his five brothers also joined the police. After serving a uniformed police constable, he joined Buckinghamshire CID. He married Anne Thomas in 1934, who was a nurse in the hospital where he had his appendix removed.Alex May, 'Fewtrell, (Ernest) Malcolm (1909‚Äì2005)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2009 accessed 14 Feb 2014 His reserved occupation as a police officer made him exempt from military service in the Second World War. He rose through the police ranks, becoming Detective Inspector at Chesham in 1950, and Detective Superintendent in 1954, and head of Buckinghamshire CID. He was involved in the A6 murder investigation when he was asked to find 10 redheaded men for an identity parade with James Hanratty. Great Train Robbery On 8 August 1963, Fewtrell was called out in the early morning to Bridgego Bridge, near Linslade. He was head of the Buckinghamshire CID located at Aylesbury, and within a year of his scheduled retirement. The track-side signal lights had been tampered with to stop the Glasgow‚ÄìLondon mail train. The engine and the high-value carriage, containing money deposited at Scottish banks after the previous bank holiday weekend, had been decoupled from the other carriages, which were left a mile behind at Sears Crossing. The gang of robbers escaped with ¬£2,600,000 of used banknotes. The train's driver, Jack Mills, had been beaten over the head and never fully recovered. Fewtrell arrived at the scene of the crime at 5am and gathered evidence before taking statements from the driver and postal workers at Cheddington railway station. He established that about 15 hooded men in boiler suits were involved. Fewtrell originally thought that the robbers could have escaped to London via the nearby M1, but one member of the gang had made the mistake of telling the postal staff not to move for half an hour after they left and this suggested to the police that their hide-out could not be more than away. Having failed to find any forensic evidence at the crime scene, the police fanned out on a major search. The resources of the Buckinghamshire police force were stretched, and Fewtrell advised the Chief Constable of Buckinghamshire to call in the Metropolitan Police at Scotland Yard. Over the following days, Fewtrell worked closely with Detective Superintendent Gerald McArthur reviewing the clues in the local area, while Detective Chief Superintendent Tommy Butler and Detective Sergeant Jack Slipper investigated leads in London. The gang's hideout at Leatherslade Farm near Oakley was discovered a few days later. After the farm was found by local police, Fewtrell visited with two Metropolitan Police detectives, where they found food, drink, and items from the train, all covered with fingerprints. As Fewtrell later recalled, \\"the whole place is one big clue.\\" Fewtrell also interviewed Brian Field who was a solicitor's clerk who helped the robbers buy their hideout and he obtained an admission of responsibility for a hotel bill paid for with some of the stolen money. Most of the gang were captured, with the first arrests on 15 August. The trial of the gang members opened in Aylesbury in January 1964. The local court building was too small for the numbers of defendants, lawyers, witnesses and journalists in attendance, so the trial was held in the offices of Aylesbury District Council instead. Fewtrell was in charge of security of the venue and the accused, and the evidence (including ¬£300,000 in cash that had been recovered). Fewtrell's last day of service in the police was 16 April 1964, when he attended court for the sentencing. Six of the twelve defendants were sentenced to 30 years in prison ‚Äì a total 307 years between then. Later life With journalist Ronald Payne, Fewtrell wrote two long articles in The Sunday Telegraph on 19 and 26 April 1964, and a book, The Train Robbers in 1964. On leaving the police he worked at Portsmouth Polytechnic as an accommodation officer. He retired a second time in 1974, to Swanage in Dorset where he administered the neighbourhood watch. He died at Poole Hospital, after a stroke. His wife predeceased him, and he was survived by a son and a daughter. His obituary in the Daily Telegraph noted a passing resemblance to John Thaw playing Inspector Morse.

The earliest documented examples are from a book illustrated by ≈åoka Shunboku [Â§ßÂ≤°Êò•Âçú] (1680-1763) published 1746. The most popular subject for kamigata-e was kabuki theatre, with single sheet yakusha-e coming into production in the mid-eighteenth century, a full century after the genre debuted in Edo.Kitagawa 2005, 229 The major technical difference between Edo and Kamigata prints is the latter's use of kappazuri stencil printing, where colours were brushed onto paper with the aid of paper stencil patterns. This developed in Osaka around the same time as nishiki-e appeared in Edo. Also distinctive about kamigata-e is that its producers were not professional artists like their Edo counterparts. Instead, they were talented amateurs whose artistic interests were secondary to their passion for kabuki and its actors.Kitagawa 2005, 230 = Size = Measuring approximately 18 by 25 cm, ch≈´ban [‰∏≠Âà§] is the name of a standard medium-sized print. This smaller format underwent a revival from 1847 on, replacing ≈çban as the dominant format for kamigata-e.Kitagawa 2005, 231 Sadamasu/ Kunimasu was particularly influential in its popularization.Doesburg 2012 = Format = While Bust Portrait of Actor Kataoka Ichiz≈ç I is an ichimai-e [‰∏ÄÊûöÁµµ] single-sheet print, it is also the right half of a diptych. Its partner to the left is Sadamasu's portrait of actor Arashi Tokusabur≈ç III [ÂµêÂæ≥‰∏âÈÉé] (1812-1863) as the play's hero, Iwanaga Jir≈çkichi [Â≤©Â∑ùÊ¨°ÈÉéÂêâ].

These actor portraits were so marketable that most artists active in the late Edo period worked in the genre. This portrait also belongs to a yakusha-e subgenre known as ≈çkubi-e [Â§ßÈ¶ñÁµµ]. Literally \\"large head pictures\\", these images depict their subjects'‚Äîtypically beauties or kabuki actors‚Äîheads or heads and torsos. The lone figures are set against plain backgrounds, and often captured in a dramatic mie [Ë¶ãÂæó] pose. As JAANUS notes, \\"the close-up range of ookubi-e allowed the designer to emphasize particular facial features, expression, make-up or poses of favorite actors in popular roles.\\" Utagawa Kunimasu (Sadamasu I) is credited with advancing the mature Osaka style of ≈çkubi-e in the ch≈´ban format, after creating his first around 1837.Lyon Collection = Subject = The print depicts actor Kataoka Ichiz≈ç I as Tetsugadake Dazaemon in the play Sekitori Senry≈ç Nobori [Èñ¢ÂèñÂçÉ‰∏°Âπü]. Kataoka Ichiz≈ç I [ÁâáÂ≤°Â∏ÇËîµ] (1792-1862) was a celebrated Edo period kabuki actor based in Osaka. He was known for his portrayal of villains in katakiyaku [ÊïµÂΩπ] and jitsuaku [ÂÆüÊÇ™] roles.Kat≈ç He was the progenitor of the Kataoka Ichiz≈ç line, which continues to this day in its sixth generation. Ichiz≈ç I held the name from 1810 to 1858 and from 1859 to his death in 1862.Aragor≈ç 2010 Sekitori Senry≈ç Nobori [Èñ¢ÂèñÂçÉ‰∏°Âπü] by Chikamatsu Hanji was originally written for the bunraku [ÊñáÊ•Ω] puppet theatre, but adapted soon after for kabuki. It was first performed in Osaka in 1775. Translated as The Rise of the 1000 Ry≈ç Wrestler or The Sumo Wrestler's Banner, it tells the story of a young sumo wrestler's moral dilemma revolving around debt and duty. Tetsugadake Dazaemon is the rival who is ultimately defeated by the hero in the ring. = Artist = The print's attribution is a subject of some contention. Copies of the print belong to at least 2 public collections: that of the ROM, and that of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. According to its labeling, these institutions disagree on when and by whom it was produced. The problem lies mainly in the fact that the print has no date stamp and is signed Sadamasu ga [Ë≤ûÂçáÁîª], a name used by two nineteenth century Osaka print-makers: Sadamasu I and Sadamasu II.  Sadamasu I (Kunimasu)  Sadamasu's personal details are largely unknown, though his output is generally dated to the early 1830s through the early 1850s.Roberts: 1830-1852; Doesburg: 3/1830-11/1854; Pushkin: late 1820s-1852; Lyon Collection: 1832-1852; Keyes and Mizushima, and MFA Boston: 1834-1852; Barry Rosenteel Japanese Print Collection: 1832-1854 He was a wealthy property owner,Doesburg and possibly operated a shipbuilding company.Roberts 1990, 96 Sometime between 1828 and 1830 he travelled to Edo to study under Utagawa Kunisada. His earliest known print, signed \\"eshi Utagawa Sadamasu ga\\" (painted by Utagawa Sadamasu) [ÁµµÂ∏´Ê≠åÂ∑ùË≤ûÂçáÁîª], dates to early 1830. He officially changed his artist name to Kunimasu [ÂúãÂçá or ÂúãÁõä] in 1848, in recognition of Kunisada's accession to the title Toyokuni. Kunimasu produced mainly yakusha-e, portraits of kabuki actors active in Osaka. His works are credited with bold use of colour, decisive brushwork and \\"tour-de-force techniques\\". Late in his career, he turned to painting, adopting the style of the Shij≈ç school.Roberts Kunimasu actively supported Osaka printmaking by opening his own print design school, and directly mentoring many local artists. Among his pupils are: Sadayuki [Ë≤ûÈõ™] (fl. 1839-1840), Utagawa Hirosada [Ê≠åÂ∑ù Âª£Ë≤û] (fl. 1835-1850s), Masusada [ÂçáË≤û] (fl. 1848-1849) and Sadamasu II [Ë≤ûÂçá] (fl. 1849). print credited to Sadamasu II in Walters Art Museum  Sadamasu II  Even less is known about Sadamasu II [‰∫å‰ª£Ë≤ûÂçá] than about his predecessor. His active period was very brief, spanning only c. 1849-1850.Keyes and Mizushima 1973, 272 According to Doesburg, \\"Sadamasu II created only a few prints and from these it is obvious that he was not highly gifted.\\"2012 He is identified as a pupil of Kunimasu in the inscription on an undated ch≈´ban print.Keyes and Mizushima 1973, 239 Utagawa Sadamasu (Kunimasu) signature cartouche = Marks = The print has no visible date, censor or artist seals. The only distinctive mark is the toshidama-in cartouche encasing Sadamasu's signature. A symbol of good luck, this was customarily used by artists of the Utagawa school beginning with Toyokuni I in around 1809. It was Kunisada (Toyokuni III), however, who really claimed the symbol for his school, elongating its round shape and framing the red infill with yellow.Faulkner 2010 In Sadamasu's print, the characteristic yellow outline encloses pale blue infill. = Date = Just as the ROM and MFA Boston disagree on the print's artist, the museums assign different dates to the piece. While the ROM believes it to belong to the period 1849-1862, MFA Boston dates it earlier and more precisely at 1839. Assuming it to be the work of Sadamasu II, it would have to have been produced during that artist's brief window of activity, which is to say 1849-1850. In the event that Sadamasu I is the artist, the date can be narrowed based on the following: * The print belongs to Sadamasu's mature period, but prior to 1848's official name change to Kunimasu * Actor Arashi Tokusabur≈ç III appeared under that name from the fall or winter of 1830 to the 10th lunar month of 1834, then again from the 6th lunar month of 1837 to the 10th lunar month of 1843Aragor≈ç * Enactment of the Tenp≈ç Reforms from 1841 to 1843 resulted in a hiatus in yakusha-e production during the early 1840s * Inscriptions of actor and role names disappeared from covert yakusha-e under the Tenp≈ç Reforms and did not reappear until around 1855 * Surviving records of Edo period kabuki performances show that Sekitori Senry≈ç Nobori was performed at Osaka's ≈ånishi [Â§ßË•ø] theatre in the eighth lunar month of the year Tenp≈ç 10, i.e. 1839Akama 2006 The above would seem to indicate that the print, if the work of Sadamasu I, belongs to the period 1837-1843, with 1839‚Äîas the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston claims‚Äîbeing a likely date.In addition, a series of full-body portraits by the same artist of the same actors in the same roles is dated 8/1839 by the Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum of Waseda University. See http://enpaku.waseda.ac.jp/db/enpakunishik/results-big.php?shiryo_no=016-0085 = Provenance = The print was given to the ROM by Sir Edmund Walker (1848‚Äì1924), president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and first Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the ROM. Walker began collecting Japanese art in the 1870s, making him one of the earliest North American collectors.Waterhouse 1975, 12 He bought many pieces in New York in the 1870s and '80s, and during a trip to London in 1909.Waterhouse 1975, 13 In 1919, after travelling to Japan, China and Korea, he was named Honorary Consul-General of Japan for Toronto.Waterhouse 1975, 15  See also  * Utagawa Kunimasu * Kataoka Ichiz≈ç * Spring and autumn landscapes (Hara Zaish≈ç) - hanging scroll in same gallery * Unit 88-9 (Kiyomizu Masahiro) - sculpture in same gallery * Female Ghost (Kunisada) - print in same gallery * Fan print with two bugaku dancers (Kunisada) - print in same gallery * Ichikawa Omez≈ç as a Pilgrim and Ichikawa Yaoz≈ç as a Samurai (Toyokuni I) - print in same gallery * Eijud≈ç Hibino at Seventy-one (Toyokuni I) - print in same gallery * View of Temp≈çzan Park in Naniwa (Goch≈çtei Sadamasu) - print in same collection * Actor Arashi Rikan II as Osome (Ry≈´sai Shigeharu) - print in same collection * Two Actors in Samurai Roles (Gosotei Hirosada) - print in same collection  Notes   References  * Akama, Ry≈ç. \\"Ê≠åËàû‰ºé„ÉªÊµÑÁë†ÁíÉËààË°åÂπ¥Ë°® (Chronology of Kabuki & J≈çruri Performances).\\" The Digital Humanities Center for Japanese Arts and Cultures (DH-JAC) at Ritsumeikan University. 2006/11/13.

Captain Belchior Cala√ßa was tasked with fortifying Muscat, Oman. He left Goa, Portuguese India, on 9 January 1587 as captain of one of the ships in an expedition led by Martim Affonso de Mello. The main purpose was punitive, in response to aggression by the Turks on the East coast of Africa. The fleet visited Ampaza, which they destroyed, Pate, where the ruler submitted, then Lamu, where the ruler had fled. They went on to Malindi and then Mombasa, which they looted and burned. From there they sailed for the Strait of Hormuz, stopping at Muscat where Cala√ßa remained while the fleet went on to Hormuz. On arrival at Muscat Cala√ßa built the fortress now called Fort Al Jalali, then named Forte de S√£o Jo√£o. The top of the prominence on which the fort stands was first leveled, and the rock was scarped. Cala√ßa built a cistern to hold water for the occupants and armed the fort with cannon. Cala√ßa also built the fort now called Fort Al-Mirani, but then called Capit√£o (Captain), presumably named after Cala√ßa. An engraved stone in Fort Mirani reads (in Portuguese), In May 1588 a party of Jesuit missionaries led by Pedro P√°ez arrived at Muscat, where Cala√ßa was in command, en route to Ethiopia. He advised them to travel via the Strait of Mecca. They were not able to take this advice, and ran into many difficulties before reaching their destination. Belchior Cala√ßa was responsible for military architecture in Ormuz until 1589, when he was replaced by Francisco Velho. Around 1598 Cala√ßa was involved in an unsuccessful attack on Cuneale in the peninsula of Pudepatam, 77 leagues from Goa and 35 from Cochin, on the Malabar Coast of India. He gave the signal for attack too soon. Only part of the force engaged the enemy, many were killed and the remainder were forced to retreat.

Its work is analogous to that of groups and consortia that have developed standardized methods that allow different types of equipment to seamlessly connect and share data, such as the USB and Bluetooth. Specifications The PSIA has created seven complementary specifications that enable systems and devices to interoperate and exchange data and intelligence.http://psialliance.org/SpecificationsOverview.html Three of these specifications are the ‚Äúreference works‚Äù for the family of specifications. These are the Service Model; PSIA Common Metadata & Event Model; and the PSIA Common Security Model. These ‚Äúcommon models‚Äù define and describe various security events as well as computer network and software protocols relevant to security devices and systems. The other four PSIA specifications correspond to domains in the security ecosystem. These are the IP Media Device specification, Recording and Content Management specification, Video Analytics specification and Area Control specification. These base their communications about security events on the PSIA Common Metadata & Event Model, one of the reference works described above. PSIA specifications are expected to become more critical to security system architecture as major users integrate video surveillance, access and area control, mobile devices and local and cloud-based storage across a common information technology platform. PSIA has a liaison with the International Electrotechnical Commission on two specifications for access control and video. The access control specification, IEC 60839-11-1, pending a vote, is expected to have a big impact on the manufacturing and interoperability of thousands of access control systems. =PSIA Common Security Model v1.0= The PSIA Common Security Model (CSEC) specification is the comprehensive PSIA specification for all protocol, data and user security. It covers security requirements and definitions for network and session security, key and certificate management, and user permission management. These security definitions apply to all PSIA nodes. PSIA Common Metadata & Event Model The Common Metadata and Event Model provides a common set of services used by disparate physical security technologies, such as chemical/biological sensors, intrusion devices, video analytics, and traffic control sensors, to respond to various types of alerts. This specification allows vendors to simplify their interoperability communications by simply putting their device-specific information on top of the baseline Common Metadata and Event Model protocols and services.http://www.psialliance.org/PSIAIntroducesCMEM.html =IP Media Device Specification (IPMD) 1.1= The IP Media Device (video) specification enables interoperability among disparate products that comply with the specification, such as an IP camera, intrusion device and video management or access control system. Interoperability based on this specification eliminates the need for software development kits for custom drivers and interfaces. It essentially creates a common API which can be used by both device and VMS vendors which offers an alternative to the proprietary APIs that exist today.http://psialliance.org/documents/1.0SpecRelease-Final090314WEB.pdf =Recording and Content Management (RaCM) Specification, Version 1.1a= The PSIA Recording and Content Management (RaCM) Specification, Version 1.1a, describes the PSIA standards for recording, managing, searching, describing, and streaming multimedia information over IP networks. This includes support for both NVRs and DVRs. The specification references the PSIA Service Model and IP Media Device specifications. XML schema definitions and XML examples are included in the specification to aid implementers in developing standards- based products.http://psialliance.org/RaCMSpecOverview.html =Video Analytics Specification v1.0= The v1.0 Video Analytics Specification (VAS) specifies an interface that enables IP devices and video management/surveillance systems to communicate video analytics data in a standardized way. The scope for the initial release of the specification focuses entirely on video analytics capabilities discovery and analytic data output. Video analytic capabilities discovery will include standard configuration data exchange to enable any analytic device to communicate to another device or application its basic analytic capabilities at the device level and the video channel level (for multichannel devices). This includes information such as the PSIA VAS version number supported, analytic vendor information (name, software version number, etc.), event types and mechanisms supported, and other supported configurations. From an analytic output perspective, the v1.0 VAS includes the definition of multiple types of analytic events, including alerts and counts, as well as video analytics metadata output.http://psialliance.org/VideoAnalyticsOverview.html =PSIA Area Control Specification V1.0= This specification standardizes the communication into access control and intrusion products, making them interoperable with an overall security system. This specification takes advantage of other PSIA specs, especially the Common Metadata and Events Model (CMEM). Harmonizing and sharing data between access control, intrusion, video, and analytics systems results in optimized and more easily integrated security management.http://psialliance.org/AreaControlOverview.html =PSIA Access Control Profile and Intrusion Detection Profile= The PSIA currently offers an Access Control Profile and an Intrusion Detection Profile, each derived from the PSIA‚Äôs Area Control Specification. Not every manufacturer supports every use case covered in the Area Control Specification. By complying with the applicable Profiles, these manufacturers can still build PSIA plug-and- play interoperability into their products. Products and technology that comply with a PSIA Profile will interoperate with any other product or technology that is PSIA compliant to that Profile. The PSIA offers a Profiles Test Tool to validate that a Profiles implementation is correct and complete and ensures manufacturers‚Äô products will interoperate with other PSIA-compliant products.http://psialliance.org/Profiles.html Specification adoption More than 1500 companies have registered for the 1.0 IP Media Device (video) specification since its initial release in March 2008. Commercially available products and systems that are PSIA-compliant include physical security information management (PSIM) systems; video management systems; surveillance cameras; video analytics; access control systems; and sensors and intrusion detection devices.http://psialliance.org/faq.html The founding of the PSIA David Bunzel, executive director for a data storage industry standards association, began exploring surveillance video storage requirements in 2007 for the physical security industry. The physical security industry is known for its closed, proprietary systems; custom coding is typically required to integrate a closed system with any other system or digital tool.http://www.securitysales.com/blog/under-surveillance/story/2011/09/psia- panel-promotes-urgency-of-open-industry-standards.aspx Bunzel convened a meeting of security industry leaders to discuss creating open standards in the physical security industry. The following companies were at the initial meeting: Adesta; ADT; Anixter; Axis; Cisco; CSC; GE Security; Genetec; IBM; IQinVision; Johnson Controls; March Networks; Pelco; ObjectVideo; Orsus; Panasonic; Sony; Texas Instruments; Verint; and Vidyo. The development of PSIA specifications PSIA supports license-free standards and specifications, which are vetted in an open and collaborative manner and offered to the security industry as a whole. Five active working groups, IP Video, Video Analytics, Recording and Content Management, Area Control, and Systems, develop these specifications. A specification can be developed in a variety of ways, including a submission of a core document by a member company or a working group submission based on input from the committee members. In either case the document is expanded and reviewed by its working group members, with consensus determining the features and characteristics of the specification.http://www.psialliance.org/faq.html Members The organization's members include leading manufacturers, systems integrators, consultants and end users.

Cars, trucks, boats, construction and maintenance equipment, and even aircraft and military vehicles can all be cleaned in a wash rack. Wash racks are usually mobile and constructed from steel, although plastic wash racks exist as well as concrete formed alternatives which are sometimes installed in permanent facilities. The term wash rack is also used to describe pads for washing horses. Wash racks for vehicle washing may be called closed-loop washing systems, heavy duty wash systems and degreasing pads. Wash racks are often called \\"containment racks\\" or \\"containment pads\\" because their purpose is to contain effluent which often consists of hazardous materials that have been dislodged from the wash subject, and prevent it from draining off into the ground and causing stormwater contamination. Instead, the waste water is pumped out of the wash rack and into some sort of filtration system which removes the contaminants then sends the water either back into the pressure washer for reuse or into a sanitary sewer. The main purpose of a wash rack is to clean equipment while protecting the environment from contaminants commonly found on construction, maintenance and military vehicles or equipment. To comply with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations, which are intended to prevent soil-borne insects or other potentially harmful organisms from entering the United States, U.S. military vehicles and equipment must be thoroughly washed before being shipped home. As such, wash racks are commonly used by the US military to ensure vehicles are clean and safe before they are brought back into the country. According to statistics, wash racks help recycle thousands of gallons of water on a daily basis and are already part of many military construction projects around the world. Industrial water use was estimated at 18.5 billion gallons per day in the United States in 2005, a number that could be greatly reduced by using wash racks to recycle and reuse water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, wash racks are also important in controlling the spread of noxious weeds and invasive species in the agricultural industry, as well as forestry.

Originally constructed in the 9th century in Romanesque style, the building was renovated several times. After it collapsed, it was rebuilt in the 15th century. Now in ruins, Dr. Manuel Riu Riu, made several excavations between 1971‚Äì77, which served to expose unique building architecture and important Catalan Romanesque necropolis. History The monastery was founded by Father Daniel and devotee Honesta in the early 10th century. They received the land for the formation of the monastery before the year 939. In that year, Sunifred II of Cerdanya gave the land which then helped form a religious community with an abbot and six monks. Although the monastery increased its assets in 965, by the year 983, Count Cabreta Oliva gave the monastery Sant Lloren√ß prop Bag√†. Monks no longer resided at the monastery by the mid-11th century. Architecture Building diagram The building has a round centralized midsection covered with a dome and a semicircular apse on the eastern side. The church door is opposite the apse. Constructed of small blocks, they were left unpolished. The blocks are arranged in rows and joined with mortar. It is believed that the structure was covered with a dome made of small blocks, arranged concentrically. The base of the walls is thick, with a bench that went around the entire structure, including the apse. At the back of the apse exists a loophole window.

It took place on February 6‚Äì7, 1863, in the town of Siemiatycze, Russian Empire (now Poland). Russian forces of some 2,500 under General Zachar Maniukin clashed with 4,000 Polish insurgents commanded by Walenty Lewandowski, Roman Roginski and Wladyslaw Cichorski-Zameczek. The battle was won by the Russians, and their victory had widespread implications in the area of Bia≈Çystok, as local population decided not to back the uprising. Siemiatycze, located in Grodno Governorate, was one of centers of Polish patriotic movement in 1860 ‚Äì 1862. For unknown reasons, in 1862 a Russian garrison was withdrawn from the town, which allow Polish conspirators to act freely. The insurgents held their meetings in the palace of Duchess Anna Jablonowska, which also served as a storage of weapons, uniforms and food. The uprising itself did not begin here on January 22, 1863, but a few days later, when news of it reached the town. Due to lack of Russian garrison, insurgents from whole area began to gather in Siemiatycze in early February. First unit to arrive here was led by Wladyslaw Cichorski-Zameczek, and it had volunteers from the area of ≈Åom≈ºa. Soon afterwards it was joined by a unit under Roman Roginski, which came from the nearby village of Biala Podlaska. Both units merged under leadership of Walenty Lewandowski, the military commander (naczelnik) of the uprising in the region of Podlasie. The battle lasted for two days, and began with a Russian assault on Polish positions. Polish kosynierzy managed to stop the Cossacks, with heavy losses on both sides. On the next day, Russian reinforcements arrived and Polish insurgents, facing supreme firepower of the enemy, had to retreat. The Cossacks entered Siemiatycze on February 7, and the insurgents fled either to Congress Poland, or Bialowieza Forest. Altogether some 200 Poles were killed in the battle, while Russians lost some 70 soldiers. Siemiatycze, with its mostly wooden houses, was completely burned, and its residents had to flee to the nearby forests. Consequences of Polish defeat were widespread, as the uprising lost its momentum in the region of Podlasie, and failed to attract local masses.  Sources  * Jan Buraczynski, Roztocze.

Early years Hull was born on September 1, 1923, in Birmingham, Alabama. In his memoir, he describes how, in his boyhood, he read Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, and other science-fiction writers, and discovered physics and Albert Einstein while doing school projects. In a 2004 letter to the New York Review of Books, Hull wrote that his father had ‚Äútried to enlist‚Äù in General John J. Pershing's expedition to bring Pancho Villa to justice, ‚Äúbut needed his mother‚Äôs permission, which was not given. In 1917, he did enlist, and went to France with Pershing in the 4th Alabama, where he was in combat until wounded at Soissons, and in hospital service until 1919.‚Äùhttp://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2004/jul/15/a-major- attack/?pagination=false In the autumn of 1941, Hull entered Mississippi State University to study physics. After his freshman year, according to a 2007 newspaper profile, ‚Äúhe quit school and became a draftsman for an ordnance plant, where he was trained to test explosives to see if they were pure enough to be used for shells.‚Äù The Army and Los Alamos In 1943 Hull was drafted into the Army Specialized Training Program, which identified enlisted personnel who had technical skills or some science education. He was assigned to the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In the autumn of 1944, Hull and three other men were ordered to take a train from Oak Ridge to Lamy, New Mexico, where Hull dialed a number he had been told to call. A bus showed up and took Hull and his companions to Los Alamos. ‚ÄúI never saw those men again,‚Äù Hull later recalled. Although he had only a high-school diploma, he had been identified as promising student of physics. He was put to work developing methods for, and overseeing, the casting of explosive lenses which would compress a plutonium core, resulting in an implosion. Hull, a sergeant, acted as foreman, supervising the team of civilians who worked on the casting. During the months when he worked on the project to create Fat Man, the atomic bomb that would be dropped over Nagasaki, he was not told explicitly that he was working on a bomb. ‚ÄúBut I knew enough physics to figure out what was going on.‚Äù His work, which lasted until the summer of 1945, was considered so dangerous that the lab where he worked with his team was 15 miles from the other scientists' labs. In order to cast the explosives, according to the New York Times, Hull used candy kettles and malted-milk stirrers.https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/29/science/oppenheimer-celebration- examines-the-myth-and-the-man.html?pagewanted=all&src;=pm ‚ÄúWe actually used a candy kettle ... to melt the explosives and then poured them into the mold to make the lenses,‚Äù Hull told MSNBC in an interview.NBC News An article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists tells the story this way: ‚ÄúOne of Hull's early assignments was to figure our how to eliminate air bubbles in the explosive lenses. Remembering his experience making milk shakes as a waiter at college, he devised a stirrer that could be drawn up through the molten mixture, effectively bringing the bubbles to the surface.‚Äù In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the atom bomb, Hull told CBS: ‚ÄúWe were pouring two--two- speed explosives: a slow explosive called baritar, which was barium nitrate and TNT, mainly, and then a faster explosive called Comp-B, which had TNT in it and the rest of it either classified or I don't remember. It was--it was fast.‚Äù Asked by a CBS reporter whether there had been ‚Äúwhite coats‚Äù or a ‚Äúlab atmosphere,‚Äù Hull replied: ‚ÄúOh, Lord, no.‚Äù Hull later recalled ‚Äúthe day that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of Los Alamos, brought Gen. Leslie Groves out to the lab. While looking at the mold for the lens, Groves accidentally stepped on and disconnected a hot water line. A stream of extremely hot water came out of the socket behind him, hitting him squarely in the rear. Hull succeeded ‚Äì just barely ‚Äì in stifling his laughter, but only until Oppenheimer turned to him and remarked that the incident ‚Äújust goes to show you the incompressibility of water.‚Äù There was no way Hull could contain himself after that. (Hull was relieved that Groves did not recognize him at the Trinity test several months later.)‚Äù Hull was still at work on Fat Man At 5:30 A.M. on July 16, 1945, the test bomb produced by the project was detonated on the Alamogordo Bombing Range south of Los Alamos. ‚ÄúI was invited to go to a viewing site 20 miles away to watch,‚Äù Hull later said. ‚ÄúIt was pitch dark, and then suddenly, this brilliant light flashed, but since we were 20 miles away, we heard no sound,‚Äù says Hull. Hill later said that the biggest surprise of his life was discovering that despite ‚Äústrict internal security‚Äù in the Manhattan Project, ‚ÄúSoviet KGB agents managed to get near enough to learn some things.‚Äù Reflections on the morality of the bomb When he was first working on Fat Man, Hull ‚Äúdidn't want it dropped on people,‚Äù but rather wished it would be detonate ‚Äúin the Tokyo Harbor or in an isolated area, to scare them. But when Hirohito didn't surrender, even after the Aug. 6 bombing of Hiroshima, we knew we had no choice.‚Äù In 2007, Hull expressed hope that nuclear bombs would never be used again. When it turned out that ‚Äúthe blast [over Nagasaki] was a good one,‚Äù Hull said in a 1995 interview with CNN, ‚Äúit was a tremendous relief. All of us felt that way. All of us felt that way. We had done it. But at the same time, immediately both of us who knew the score began to think, OK, what have we done? What have we done?...How many of us knew everything about the bomb, enough to know what its potential was? Well, a relatively small number, maybe a thousand. Maybe a few of them. So let's say a thousand just to be generous. How many people were killed ‚Äî 20,000. It means I'm responsible for 400? That's the kind of arithmetic that bothers you.‚Äù ‚ÄúDifferent kinds of people worked on the Manhattan Project, from the greatest scientist in the world to the ordinary people doing ordinary things,‚Äù Hull said in a 2006 interview. He also said that ‚Äú[a]nyone who works on weapons has a responsibility for people who are killed with those weapons....As a consequence, I have a personal responsibility for some of those people who were killed in Nagasaki.‚Äù Still, as he told a 1985 interviewer, ‚Äúmy colleagues and I were very pleased that our efforts had not failed....We had no idea about the tactics or the strategy of using both bombs. And today, it is still controversial whether the second bomb should have been used or whether either bomb should have been used. But that's hindsight.‚Äùhttp://www.abqjournal.com/obits/profiles/15215095397obitsprofiles02-15-11.htm Asked in a 1995 interview on CBS News Sunday Morning whether, if he could go back in time, he would participate again in the creation of the bomb, Hull said: ‚ÄúI would again do whatever was necessary to defend our way of life, to save the life of this country and this society, which, as difficult, as fragile and as‚Äîas flawed as it is, it's still the best the world has ever seen. That I'd‚Äîthat I'd do it again. Sorry.‚Äù Postwar career After the war Hull attended Yale University, where he earned a B.S. in 1948 and a Ph.D. in 1951. He went on to teach physics at Yale for 20 years. Hull later said that the person who had exerted the greated professional influence upon him was Gregory Breit, the theoretical nuclear physicist who ‚Äúwas my mentor and friend for 20 years through my career at Yale.‚Äù He also taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he was the dean of graduate and professional education, and at Oregon State University. He moved to Albuquerque in 1977 to take up the position of provost at the University of New Mexico, where he also taught physics. He remained as provost until the mid 1980s, and retired from UNM in 1989. Hull played an instrumental role in the establishment of UNM‚Äôs optics program. He was also a strong supporter of the university's Peace Studies program. In 2007 he said that his greatest professional pride was a course he had taught ‚Äúfor more than 30 years‚Äù called Physics and Society. He had ‚Äúhoped to promote closer relations between the arts and sciences at the University of New Mexico by creating a modern Aristotelian program recognizing the unity of knowledge. I came close, but ran out of time.‚Äù In his later years, when his wife began to lose her eyesight owing to macular degeneration, Hull created a device intended to improve her vision by ‚Äúdirect[ing] light to portions of the retina unaffected by the disease to compensate for the loss in the central vision field.‚Äù Patented and marketed as the MacVision lens technology, it was put on the market in 2009 by MacVision Technologies, a joint venture by the University of New Mexico and Select Universities Technology, Inc. Hull said in 2007 that he had never met any survivors of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. ‚ÄúI have had Japanese students in my courses, perhaps children of survivors, in which I discussed the bombings,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe students seemed to accept the bombings as justified by the Japanese aggression.‚Äù He moved to Charleston, South Carolina, in 2007. At the time of his death, on February 9, 2011, aged 87, he was Professor Emeritus of Physics at UNM. Former University of New Mexico Provost and Professor Emeriti of Physics. Beliefs and opinions He said that his strongest belief was that ‚Äú[t]here is no acceptable degree of nuclear war, for once launched, no one can control the course of it.‚Äù A reviewer wrote that ‚ÄúHull's love of science permeates his memoir,‚Äù and quoted him as writing: ‚ÄúIt usually surprises me ‚Äì pleasurably ‚Äì when I discover that something I've worked out in theory actually works out in the real world....To paraphrase Einstein, the greatest puzzle about the universe is that we understand it!‚Äù He told a 2006 interviewer, ‚ÄúI believe people in general, who are not going to be physicists, need to understand how physics affects their lives.‚Äù In a letter the same year to the New York Times, reacting to a column about college education by David Brooks, Hull wrote: ‚ÄúThe humanities without the sciences are incomplete, and the sciences without the humanities dangerous.‚Äùhttp://brooks.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/03/02/how-to-get-an-education- in-college/ Books His memoir, Rider of the Pale Horse: A Memoir of Los Alamos and Beyond, co-authored with Amy Bianco, was published in 2006 by UNM Press.https://www.amazon.com/By-McAllister-Hull-Memoir-Alamos/dp/B008VQZ57S The title of the memoir refers to Revelation 6:8: ‚ÄúBehold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.‚Äù He was also the author of a 1969 textbook, The Calculus of Physics.https://www.amazon.com/The-calculus-physics-McAllister- Hull/dp/B0006BZC92 Personal Hull was married for 65 years to Mary Muska Hull, who survived him. They had two children, John Hull and Wendy McCabe, and three grandchildren, Isaac Hull, Damaris McDonald and Ursula McCabe. In 2007 he listed his pastimes as ‚Äústudying serious music, theater and art history‚Äù and said that in earlier years he had been interested in ‚Äúflying light planes, mountain hiking, skydiving and building furniture.‚Äù References American physicists American nuclear physicists Manhattan Project people University of New Mexico faculty Yale University alumni Yale University faculty 1923 births 2011 deaths ","title":"McAllister Hull"},{"id":"41191172","title":"Gowry Retchakan"},{"id":"41191174","text":"Seylatan Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in the Central District of Bijar County, Kurdistan Province, Iran.

Discussion Scholars have long been perplexed by the name Erikepaios, and naturally, most of them have attempted to derive it from Greek etymology, however this seems questionable linguistically. The name has also been thought to have Hebrew origins because of its resemblance to erekh appayim. It has been argued, even in antiquity, that the name Erikepaios was an Oriental import. Thus, John Malalas, the 6th century CE Antiotian historian, derives the name from the language spoken in his region. The name is first mentioned with certainty in the Orphic papyrus from Gur√¥b, a Dionysian mysteries text of the late 3rd century BCE. The mythographer Otto Gruppe suggested the Phanes-myth appeared in its original form in Babylonia. Thence it spread over the Near East, and took root particularly in Syria and Asia Minor. The gods of Babylon themselves were not imported, but the myth was attached to the local deities of the districts to which it spread. Erikepaios became important in various Neoplatonic writings of the so-called \\"Rhapsodic Theogony\\", now lost, it was composed in the Hellenistic period, incorporating earlier works.

It is located in Zone A and is the most central station on the Metro, located at the Puerta del Sol square. Because of its location, it is one of the busiest stations of the Madrid Metro.  History  Line 1 station became operational in 1919 with the opening of the first section of the Madrid Metro between Sol and Cuatro Caminos. The station of Line 2 was opened in 1924, it was built above the Line 1 station and perpendicular to it. The station of Line 3 was opened in 1936, located roughly at the same level as the Line 1 station and perpendicular to the Line 2. The first sections of the first three lines opened included Sol station. In the 1960s platforms on the Line 1 were enlarged from 60 to 90 m, but bad condition of the foundations of the surface buildings prevented doing that on both platforms in parallel. So one of the platforms was expanded to the north and another one to the south, resulting in the only Madrid Metro station with non-parallel platforms. Between 2004 and 2006, Line 3 platforms were also extended from 60 to 90 m, this time they are completely parallel. At the same time elevators installation began, that allowed access to lines 2 and 3 and from the street to the lobby since 2007. The station was renamed 'vodafone Sol' from 2013 to 2016.At present, the station has four entrances, which, given the large number of travelers, often causes crowds on the stairs. Its interior features a wide central room with decorated ceiling, where are several shops and a police station. On 13 March 2012 Sol station was renamed as \\"Sol Galaxy Note\\" for a 1-month contract sponsorship by the company Samsung advertising its mobile device. It was a pilot project of naming rights sale to finance public transportation.¬´Sol, primera estaci√≥n con patrocinador¬ª, El Pa√≠s, 12 de marzo de 2012 From 1 June 2013 to 31 May 2016, for sponsorship reasons, the Line 2 station was renamed \\"Vodafone Sol\\".Sol Station and Line 2 of Metro Madrid recover their original name Metro Madrid, 1 June 2016 Cercan√≠as platforms at Sol In 2004 work began to connect the station to the Cercan√≠as Madrid network, digging tunnel Atocha- Chamart√≠n, alternative to the previously built one. This tunnel was opened to the public on 9 July 2008 and the station opened on 27 June 2009. The works suffered a 6-month break in 2006 due to discovery of archaeological remains, so the work of the station was considerably delayed with respect to the whole tunnel. From 25 June to 23 July 2008 Line 2 was temporarily interrupted to allow the construction of Cercan√≠as station nearby. The Line 1 service was also interrupted from August to 4 September 2008.

In the night of February 17/18, 1863, an Imperial Russian Army unit, stationed in W≈Çoc≈Çawek was alarmed by the news that Polish insurgents concentrated near the village of Niszczewy in the region of Kuyavia. The Russians, commanded by Colonel Yury Ivanovich Szylder, immediately marched to Sluzew, where they joined Russian border guards. All together, their forces had some 1,000 men, with a few cannons. Colonel Szylder, without wasting time, decided to attack the Poles, who were still in the process of concentrating. After a skirmish that lasted several hours, Ludwik Mieroslawski ordered the insurgents to retreat. The battle ended in Russian victory, and the dead insurgents were buried in KrzywosƒÖdz and nearby village of Dobre. Among those killed were Jan Wasilowski (a student of Liege Technical University and brother of Maria Konopnicka), and Stanislaw Gay ‚Äì the son of architect Jakub Gay.

A year later, the Rev. Calbraith Perry and the Mount Calvary vestry nominated two candidates, one for holy orders and the other a deacon to receive priesthood, but both were objected to by the Standing Committee of the Diocese, who stated that the testimonials from the Rev. Perry and the vestry ‚Äì declaring that the candidates had not taught or believed anything contrary to Church teaching ‚Äì were not sufficient. William Pinkney (bishop), a low church Anglican, declined to engage the Standing Committee on this matter.Orlando Hutton Life of the Right Reverend William Pinkney, Fifth Bishop of Maryland (Washington DC: Gibson Bros, 1890). pages 289-299. The New York Times reported, ‚ÄúThe advanced ritualism practiced in the services has on various occasions led to spicy discussions between the Standing Committee and the Rectors of Mount Calvary.\\" The same article reported that one of the parish clergymen, Father Calbraith Perry, was admonished and instructed ‚Äúto cease using incense and not to wear a cope.‚ÄùNew York Times, February 21, 1887, page 1. In 1894, Mount Calvary was \\"practically excommunicated\\" when Bishop William Paret ‚Äì whose \\"stinging philippic fell from the lips\\" ‚Äì refused to visit the church to administer the sacraments, for the church ‚Äì over the bishop's objections ‚Äì had installed confessionals and continued to use incense.New York Times, May 31, 1894, page 5. Even so, Richard Meux Benson, co-founder of the Society of St. John the Evangelist, chose to spend Lent in Baltimore in 1895 and lectured on Thursday evenings at Mount CalvaryThe Churchman, March 16, 1895, page 384 and would visit again, speaking on Palm Sunday on March 29, 1896,'The Churchman, April 18, 1896 page 538 and preaching at the parish on Low Sunday, April 17, 1898.The Churchman, April 23, 1898, page 612 320x320px The historic traditional ritual at Mount Calvary made use of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer and the English Missal. Since being received into the Roman Catholic Church in 2012, as a community within the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, Mass is celebrated ad orientem and follows the liturgical calendar of the Ordinariate; the feast of title is Holy Cross Day. and Solemn Evensong is celebrated once a month, which incorporates Eucharistic adoration and Anglican chant. Solemn processions occur several times throughout the year, most notably on the feast of Corpus Christi. At such times, a thirty-pound silver processional cross is used (see photo). The cross was a gift to Mount Calvary from Mary Coale Redwood, whose son George was the first Baltimore officer to be killed in the First World War. It was crafted by the Warham Guild and features Christus Triumphans, as well as scenes from the life of Christ and the symbols of the four evangelists.  Ministry  One of the early parishioners was Robert E. Lee, who ‚Äúattended Mount Calvary Episcopal Church regularly‚ÄùEmory M. Thomas, Robert E. Lee: A Biography (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1997) page 148. when working on Fort Carroll in 1849 and living at 908 Madison Avenue. Baltimore was a city sharply divided during the American Civil War. The pastor of Mount Calvary Alfred Allen Paul Curtis (who later converted to Catholicism and became the second bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington) wrote that the Union victories were ‚Äústeps and stages towards eventual ruin‚Äù and that they were ‚Äúmatters of humiliation and not of thanksgiving.‚Äù Episcopalian Bishop Whittingham reacted by ceasing to be a pew holder at Mount Calvary, saying that he did not wish to be ‚Äúassociated with a body so treasonably ungrateful for Divine Mercy shown in the deliverance of the State from armed rebels and thieves.‚ÄùLetter of Bishop Whittingham to Rev. Curtis, July 18, 1863, Whittingham Papers, Peabody Institute, Baltimore. In spite of the early support of its rector for the Confederacy, Mount Calvary would become known for its outreach to the African-American community. The vestry voted \\"there should be no racial lines in the free seats of Mount Calvary Church,\\" Calbraith Bourn Perry.The Perrys of Rhode Island (Tobias A. Wright:, New York, 1913) p. 104. making it the first Episcopal church in Maryland to integrate. The parish \\"made an enviable name for itself by the remarkable work done by its clergy among the poor of the city‚ÄùGeorge Demille, The Catholic Movement in the American Episcopal Church (Philadelphia: Church Historical Society, 1941). and was \\"renowned for its charitable work.\\"New York Times, June 24, 1885, page 3. Much of this reputation was due to the work of the curate Father Calbraith Bourn Perry, great-nephew of Oliver Hazard Perry, whose experiences formed the basis for his book Twelve Years Among the Colored People, a Record of the Work of Mount Calvary Chapel of S. Mary the Virgin, Baltimore.Calbraith B. Perry Twelve Years Among the Colored People: A Record of the Work of Mount Calvary Chapel of S. Mary the Virgin, Baltimore (James Pott & Co.: New York, 1884) Perry was also the author of A Petition in Behalf of the Colored PeoplePerry, Calbraith B., Petition in Behalf of the Colored People (Washington DC: s.n., 1886). In 1900, it was proclaimed that Mount Calvary was ‚Äúthe head centre of very wholesome educational and social work in Baltimore and deserves better and wider appreciation.‚ÄùThomas Sewell Adams et al.

Two of these churches, Saint Mary the Virgin, founded in 1873, and Saint Katherine of Alexandria, founded in 1891, became independent parishes.

In 1872, Mother Harriet Brownlow Byron, co-founder (with the Rev. William Upton Richards) and superior of the All Saints Sisters of the Poor in England, sent Sisters Helen, Serena, and Winifred to BaltimoreSusan Mumm (ed.)

Lovell found bees hard to identify and thus began his interest in apiology, particularly studying honey bees. With Theodore D. A. Cockerell they identified 32 species in Maine and noted that some bees only visit one kind of flower such as the pickrel weed bee.Berthold Seemann, ed., The Journal of Botany, British and Foreign vol 57, 1919. 293.

James Henry Williams Jr. is a mechanical engineer, consultant, civic commentator, and teacher of engineering. He is currently Professor of Applied Mechanics in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is regarded as one of the world's leading experts in the mechanics, design, fabrication, and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of nonmetallic fiber reinforced composite materials and structures. He is also Professor of Writing and Humanistic Studies at MIT. Williams began his career in 1960 as an apprentice machinist at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. Within eight years he graduated from The Apprentice School, earned SB and SM engineering degrees from MIT, and returned to the Shipyard as a senior design engineer. Within another two years, he earned a PhD from the University of Cambridge, where he conducted theoretical elasticity and shell theory. He then chose to join the faculty at MIT, where he has spent the bulk of his career.  Early life, education, and industrial career  Williams was born in Newport News, Virginia, where he attended the segregated public schools. He was a \\"hell-raising\\" rambunctious student who never took a textbook home. Still, Williams's brilliance was recognized by some of his teachers who permitted him to read whatever he chose while in school and who devised especially difficult tests for him, independent of his classmates. Along with one or more of his teachers, he would also occasionally make up and grade the quizzes of his classmates. He went on to win statewide prizes in mathematics and science. He was also featured as a flutist in his high school band, and as an underclassman earned first chair in the all-state concert band. In 1960, Williams was among the earliest blacks admitted to the selective Newport News Shipyard Apprentice School‚Äîit attracts an average of about 4500 applications per year for approximately 250 openings, with many of the applicants having earned bachelor's degrees. He is generally regarded as the academically top student in the century-long history of the Apprentice School. In 1961 he won the Charles F. Bailey Bronze Medal (for the highest academic record by a first-year apprentice); in 1962, the Charles F. Bailey Silver Medal (highest academic record by a second-year apprentice); and, in 1963, the Charles F. Bailey Gold Medal (highest academic record by a third-year apprentice). Furthermore, in 1963 the Shipyard chose to award him a four-year full Homer L. Ferguson Scholarship to MIT. Throughout his years as a student at MIT, he consistently returned to the Shipyard during vacations and summers. In 1965, the Apprentice School awarded Williams the five-year diploma of Mechanical Designer. In 1967, he graduated from MIT with an SB in mechanical engineering, and after completing his SM in mechanical engineering in the winter of 1968, Williams returned to the Shipyard. During that period, he performed a range of mechanics calculations on the catapults, arrester cables, and power and propulsion systems of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68). During this same period, he held the title of Senior Design Engineer and was the only black among the hundreds of engineers at the Shipyard. In the fall of 1968, Williams entered the University of Cambridge (Trinity College) in England, earned the PhD in engineering, and returned to America to the mechanical engineering faculty of MIT in 1970.  Teaching  Williams has been repeatedly acclaimed and honored throughout his MIT career by numerous awards. Some of his teaching awards at MIT include: * 1973: Everett Moore Baker Memorial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching (Top MIT teaching prize awarded solely by students; he was the first Mechanical Engineering professor to receive this award.) * 1981: Jacob P. Den Hartog Distinguished Educator Award (Top teaching award in the Mechanical Engineering Department at MIT; he received the inaugural award.) * 1991: School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Excellence (He was the inaugural occupant of this MIT chair.) * 1993: MacVicar Faculty Fellow (Top MIT teaching prize awarded through MIT's executive administration for undergraduate education, requiring broad faculty and student endorsements; he was the first Mechanical Engineering professor to receive this award.) Having served as the first Housemaster of MIT's undergraduate dormitory New West Campus Houses and having supervised more than 100 research theses, Williams is highly regarded as a mentor of both undergraduate and graduate students.  Research  In the early 1970s, Williams sought to better understand the emerging carbon fiber reinforced polymeric composite materials, which were being touted as new materials to elevate the mechanical performance of structures. (Today, these materials are used in fighter and commercial aircraft, automobiles, ships, golf clubs, tennis racquets, and myriad other structures.) One of the major manufacturers of these new materials had observed that newly fabricated structures built from them had unacceptably high variabilities, resulting in structures of low reliability. Williams was retained as a consultant to determine why. In addition, Williams's efforts were recognized by both industry and the National Science Foundation and he was selected, through a university-industrial program, to spend the summer of 1974 at a major composites manufacturing facility. Williams soon realized that the unpredictability of the materials' properties was due to undetected flaws or damage within the materials as a consequence of either improper fabrication or handling, as well as the selection of the various constituents. When he examined the technical and research literature on the nondestructive testing (NDT) to find and characterize the flaws in those materials, he found very little. Moreover, the NDT results that he found generally related to metals, and most of them were qualitative. Then, in 1974, Williams founded the Composite Materials and Nondestructive Evaluation Laboratory in MIT's Mechanical Engineering Department. (He preferred the term \\"nondestructive evaluation\\" to the more common term of \\"nondestructive testing\\" to emphasize his interests in the broad structural behavior of materials even in the absence of macroscopic flaws.) With his advanced facilities in applied mathematics and experienced insights in mechanical design, Williams sought‚Äîand his subsequent career is distinguished by‚Äîquantitative analyses and characterizations of composite materials' properties and residual life based on a combination of nondestructive measurements and theoretical mechanics. Such quantitative analyses and materials characterizations have elevated the field of nondestructive testing and increased the reliable use of composite materials and structures. Williams has subsequently compiled an extensive list of research and consulting results‚Äîin several instances, groundbreaking \\"firsts\\"‚Äîin the design, fabrication, strength analysis, residual strength, fatigue life, and NDE of fiber reinforced composite materials and structures. As an industrial and governmental consultant and through his MIT Lab with his research students, he advanced the understanding of modern composite materials and structures, as well as the systems for experimentally testing them. Among many achievements, he (1) conducted the theoretical stress analyses of isotropic and anisotropic shells subjected to symmetric and asymmetric loads; (2) produced the first quantitative correlations for the solid-particle erosion of carbon fiber polymeric composites; (3) conducted the stress analyses of adhesively bonded joints in composites; (4) analyzed the enhancement of composite properties by the introduction of thermoplastic microstructures; (5) conducted the elastic and plastic acoustic emission monitoring of materials and structures, including structural bridge steels; (6) established the forefront of the quantitative thermographic analyses of composite materials and structures; (7) theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated the input-output signatures of ultrasonic transducers; (8) hypothesized and then produced the first ultrasonic wave- fatigue life correlations of as-fabricated composites; (9) hypothesized and then produced the first ultrasonic wave-residual strength correlations of impact-damaged composites; (10) performed theoretical and applied ultrasonics of metals with and without macroscopic cracks, including a focus on structural bridge steels; (11) performed theoretical and applied ultrasonics of composites; (12) conducted theoretical and experimental dynamic fracture of composite materials and structures; (13) performed theoretical analyses of wave propagation in anisotropic media as related to composite materials and structures; (14) developed statistical pattern recognition concepts for NDE; (15) devised strategies for the residual life prediction of composite aircraft structures; and (16) developed acoustic emission and ultrasonic versus load correlations for synthetic braided mooring lines and composite tension legs for offshore deepwater platforms. For the decade up to 2012, he and his research students have focused on the structural integrity damage assessment and repair of modern composites, with an emphasis on naval structures; and he continues to write sole-author documents on a range of technical topics, including several of the areas mentioned above, mechanical vibration and shock mitigation, and biomimetics. From the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, Williams also (1) conducted theoretical analyses on the earthquake isolation of buildings and structures by devising the highly unconventional concept of supporting them on sliding foundations; (2) developed wave-like analyses of the dynamics and control of large space structures for earth-orbiting structural systems; and (3) performed numerous major governmental and industrial consultations, as briefly described below. By the early 1980s, he had devised ultrasonic laboratory systems for monitoring the structural integrity of composite structures in high performance aircraft. He is known for having produced \\"the first theoretical models that predicted the acousto‚Äìultrasonic waveforms as actually observed\\" in experiments and practice, as conducted at NASA Lewis and elsewhere. Today, Williams is broadly recognized as one of the world's leading researchers in the mechanics and nondestructive testing of composite materials and structures: He was chosen by the editorial board of the American Society for Nondestructive Testing to be the first guest technical editor of its Special Focus issue on the NDT of Composites. Williams has also shown a sense of humor such as when (1) he led a group of students in building the world's largest yo-yo and tested it from the tallest building in Cambridge, Massachusetts; (2) he lightheartedly assumed the role as one of Boston's men of elegance and style; and (3) he derived a mathematical proof of the counterintuitive number of rotations made by a non- slipping smaller cylinder rolling around a larger stationary cylinder, as presented in the popular \\"Ask Marilyn\\" column of the 72-year-old Parade Magazine, which is inserted into about 700 U.S. Sunday newspapers.  Consulting  During his career, Williams has conducted dozens of industrial and governmental consultations including (1) papermaking calender rolls, for which \\"he is considered, by virtue of his extensive work in the field, to be the nation's leading expert on stresses in rotary paper dryers\\"; (2) the first automated system for installing recessed highway lane delineation reflectors; (3) an earthquake analysis of the 500 KV bus system of the British Columbia (Canada) hydroelectric power generating station and the design of an isolation system to protect its electrical lines during seismic activity; (4) the design of composite rocket motor casings; (5) the residual-life prediction of composite aircraft structures; (6) the stress analysis of a high-speed optical pulsing system; (7) the stress analysis of pelvic implants and bone stints for the Orthop√¶dic Unit of the Massachusetts General Hospital; (8) the effect of ultrasonic irradiation on the enhancement of composite fabrication; (9) the ultrasonic NDE delineation of strength and rupture modes in adhesively bonded joints; (10) the design of deepwater mooring composite systems for offshore oil platforms; (11) an NDE regimen for the structural acceptance of composite automotive leaf springs; among others.  Controversies  = MIT fasting protest = Professor James H. Williams Jr. sitting in protest in front of the Office of the MIT President and Provost, 3 April 1991. In April 1991, Williams‚Äîat that time, the only native-born black American faculty member in the combined School of Engineering and School of Science at MIT‚Äîconducted a fasting sit-in each Wednesday throughout April. He was protesting the lack of black faculty and a lack of inspirational education for minority students. During his protest, he set up a temporary office in the corridor at the entrance of the offices of the MIT president and provost. He observed that some aspects of the black community have disproportionately suffered attendant with integration because, in the broadest sense, many talented blacks have left the black community (no matter where it exists)‚Äîthey no longer live in or relate to it; \\"they have been encouraged to escape from their roots.\\" The residual black community is less educated and financially poorer. He characterized this phenomenon as \\"neocolonialist.\\" = Crash of American Airlines Flight 587 = On November 12, 2001, shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport, American Airlines Flight 587, an Airbus Industrie A300-600, crashed in Queens, New York, killing 251 passengers, a crew of 9, and 5 people on the ground. At the request of several American Airlines pilots, Williams analyzed and then challenged the inspection requirements and the accident investigation conclusions of Airbus Industrie, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)‚Äîall of whom to varying degrees blamed the co-pilot of Flight 587 for the crash. The investigation and controversy concerning the crash focused on (1) the co-pilot's actions during takeoff, and (2) the aircraft's vertical stabilizer of the tail section, a complex structure of advanced composites. The vertical stabilizer on Flight 587 snapped off and landed in Jamaica Bay, away from the fuselage crash site. According to Williams, Airbus adopted an inadequate inspection policy for its composite tail, the FAA approved Airbus's deficient inspection policy, and the NTSB mis- analyzed the cause of the airline disaster. In so far as the vertical stabilizer was concerned, Airbus's nondestructive inspection policy was that damage that could not be seen with the unaided eye would not compromise its structural integrity. Such an inspection protocol greatly concerned Williams who characterized it as \\"a lamentably naive policy.\\" Williams further stated and was frequently quoted in the print and broadcast media as describing Airbus's inspection policy as \\"analogous to assessing whether a woman has breast cancer by simply looking at her family portrait.\\" Through internet postings, op-ed pieces, industrial journal articles, letters, interviews in magazines and newspapers and TV appearances, Williams challenged the preliminary remarks and the final report of the NTSB's accident investigation. Although there were several critics of the investigation, including varied pilots and pundits, Williams is widely regarded as the major engineering voice providing pushback against the conclusion that the air disaster was essentially the fault of the co-pilot. Based largely on the steadfast criticism of Airbus and the NTSB by Williams, in a tour de force of engineering and civic commentary, he compelled the NTSB and Airbus to reverse their positions on the cause of the American Airlines 587 crash as well as the required inspection procedures, thus likely saving hundreds of lives of current and future commercial airline passengers.  Publications  Williams has written hundreds of technical publications in refereed journals, conference proceedings, and major reports to industrial and governmental agencies, dozens of non-technical op-ed and political commentaries, and two books. He is the author of the highly reviewed and remarkably praised textbook Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics and the celebrated memoir I Will Love You, Forever!‚ÄîThe Quantum Mechanics of Love.

The fight's bill comes from a remark made by Tarver to Jones at center ring after the referees' instructions before the second fight. The referee asked both fighters, as is customary, if they had any questions, and Tarver stated: \\"Yeah, I got a question. You got any excuses tonight, Roy?\\" Background Tarver and Jones had fought each other twice in the previous two years. The first match took place on November 8, 2003 with Jones returning to the light heavyweight division after winning the WBA heavyweight title in his previous bout. Jones was able to narrowly defeat Tarver by majority decision to recapture the WBC light heavyweight title (which Tarver had won earlier in the year after Jones vacated it following his heavyweight title victory) and retain the WBA (Super), IBO and The Ring light heavyweight titles that he still held. The two fighters would have a rematch the following year on May 15, 2004. This time, Tarver would pick up the victory by second round knockout, becoming the first person to knock out Jones in his professional career. Jones attempted to rebound from his knockout loss to Tarver by challenging Glen Johnson for the IBF light heavyweight title, but Johnson dominated Jones for most of the fight before knocking out Jones brutally in the ninth. Tarver would then face Johnson twice, losing the first fight by a split decision, but then winning the second fight by unanimous decision to regain the IBO and The Ring titles.Johnson earns split decision over Tarver, Baltimore Sun article, 2004-12-19, Retrieved on 2013-11-25Tarver gains revenge over Johnson, BBC article, 2005-06-19, Retrieved on 2013-11-25 After Tarver's victory over Johnson, a third fight between him and Jones was made for October 1, 2005. Unlike the previous two fights, the WBA and WBC light heavyweight titles were not on the line. After winning the titles from Jones in the second fight, Tarver was stripped of both titles for choosing to face Johnson (who was also stripped of his IBF title) rather than face mandatory challenger Paul Briggs.Tarver and Johnson forfeit titles, BBC article, 2004-11-10, Retrieved on 2013-11-25 The fight Tarver served as the aggressor for nearly the entire fight as Jones kept his distance and simply did not mount enough offense. There were no knockdowns in the fight, but Tarver came close to scoring one over Jones in the eleventh round. Tarver spent the first minute wildly throwing punches at Jones, who covered up and clinched Tarver. After the referee ordered a break, Tarver landed a right hook to Jones' head that left him severely stunned. Sensing an opportunity at a knockout victory, Tarver quickly attacked Jones, who was now against the ropes, with a left uppercut, but Tarver's momentum sent him over the ropes and nearly out of the ring. Jones retreated but Tarver quickly followed up with a 25-second flurry of punches in an effort to score the knockdown, Jones survived as Tarver soon tired from throwing so many punches. Jones then turned the tables and stalked towards the exhausted Tarver who was able to dodge most of Jones' attempts and both men were able to survive the round. Ultimately, Tarver, landed a substantial amount of power punches and combinations and both threw and landed more punches (107 of 341) than Jones. Jones landed a higher percentage of his punches with a 36% success rate, but landed only 74 of his 207 thrown punches. All three judges scored the fight in favor of Tarver, who won with two scores of 116‚Äì112 and one score of 117‚Äì111.

It was translated into English in 2012 by Sheila Fischman and published by Vintage Canada. Plot summary The novel tells the tale of a woman, An Tinh Nguyen, born in Saigon in 1968 during the Tet Offensive who immigrates to Canada with her family as a child. The book switches between her childhood in Vietnam where she was born into a large and wealthy family, her time as a boat person when she left her country for a refugee camp in Malaysia, and her life as an early immigrant in Granby, Quebec. The story is told by a first-person narrative. Title The word ru has significance in both French and Vietnamese. In French, the word means stream or flow of money, tears or blood. In Vietnamese, the word means cradle or lullaby. About Kim Th√∫y wrote the book in honor of the people who welcomed her and her family into their life when they first arrived. War, migration, and resettlement are themes that reoccur throughout the novel. Style Ru is read like an autobiography but is written as the fictional tale of migrant experiences. The style of the book has been described as being an auto-fiction. The book tells the story of the first wave of Boat People who fled Vietnam between 1977 and 1979 and the trauma they lived through, taking the reader on their journey. It is estimated that more than 200,000 boat people fled, many of which drowned. The novel is written in 144 unnumbered vignettes, that share the memories of the protagonist in three completely different environments: Her childhood home in Vietnam, a refugee camp in Malaysia, and the town of Granby in Quebec, Canada. The style of writing resembles memories shared by the narrator, which are woven together to create a narrative. The characters included in the novel are the narrator's family members, both immediate and extended, as well as friends and individuals whom she encountered along her journey. The family members of the narrator are not given names, but rather given numbers. By having nameless characters, the author depersonalizes them and leaves room for interpretation. Awards and nominations The original French edition of the novel was selected for the 2014 edition of Le Combat des livres, where it was defended by author and physician Jean-Fran√ßois Chicoine. Its English translation was selected for the 2015 edition of Canada Reads by film critic and Toronto International Film Festival programmer Cameron Bailey,\\"CBC announces Canada Reads finalists\\".

However, the audience, discourse, and geographical locations in Ru are taken beyond the borders of Canada. The book has been published in Canada, both in English and French, as well as eighteen other countries. In an interview, Th√∫y describes the different perspective readers have depended on where they are from. She gives the example of people in Romania focusing on the communist regime described in the book, while people in France focused on the structure and the language used in the book. The book has been seen as controversial, especially in Vietnam where the author describes the communist history as still being recent and a sensitive topic. Th√∫y goes on to discuss that the history of the Boat People has not yet become part of Vietnam history. The novel Ru does not portray the communists in a completely negative perspective, which has caused controversy as a portion of the Vietnamese population blame them for the hardships their families endured.

He sits on the retailer's board of directors. Having first joined the company as a summer associate in high school, he became the company's fifth CEO in 2014. He previously led the company's Sam's Club division, from 2005 to 2009, and Walmart International, from 2009 to 2013. Early life McMillon was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and grew up in Jonesboro, Arkansas, the eldest of three children born to Laura and Morris McMillon, a dentist who served in Vietnam. His parents moved the family to Bentonville, Arkansas, the home of Walmart headquarters, when McMillon was 16. A sports enthusiast, McMillon played point guard on the Bentonville High School basketball team. Career McMillon has worked for Walmart throughout his career. He took on his first role with the company as a teenager in 1984. He later became a buyer, then moved into management roles before becoming CEO in 2014. =Early career= When he was a teenager, McMillon began his first job with Walmart as a summer associate. He worked during the summer unloading trucks in a distribution center. After high school, McMillon attended University of Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1989. The next year, as McMillon studied for a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from University of Tulsa, he called Walmart and told an executive he was interested in training to become a buyer when he completed his studies. Soon thereafter, McMillon rejoined Walmart as an assistant manager at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store. After completing his MBA in 1991, McMillon moved to Walmart's Bentonville headquarters to join the buyer- training program. Originally in charge of buying fishing tackle, he later took on various roles as a buyer and a merchandiser, dealing in food, clothes, crafts and furnishings. He later worked as a general merchandise manager for Walmart's wholesale store division Sam's Club before taking an executive role at Walmart, overseeing toys, electronics, and sporting goods, among other areas. =Sam's Club (2005‚Äì2009)= Walmart promoted McMillon to president and CEO of Sam's Club on August 4, 2005. Under McMillon, the wholesaler emphasized marketing to small business customers. Additionally, McMillon incorporated what The Wall Street Journal called \\"treasure hunt\\" items that are limited- selection expensive premium items, such as diamond necklaces and wine vacations, for sale next to cheap bulk goods in an attempt to compete with Costco. =Walmart International (2009‚Äì2013)= Walmart officials moved McMillon from his role at Sam's Club to lead Walmart's international division in February 2009, replacing Mike Duke, who was promoted to CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc. Under McMillon, Walmart International focused on improving in existing markets, such as Canada, China, United Kingdom and the Americas. One area of particular importance to McMillon was integrating Walmart's \\"everyday low prices\\" model to these international markets. Under McMillon, the international division acquired a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd. for . During McMillon's tenure, Walmart International's sales growth outpaced Walmart US and grew to 29 percent of total sales company-wide. When McMillon first became head of the division, it comprised more than 3,300 stores in 14 countries. When Walmart announced it would move him to head Walmart Stores, Inc. in late 2013, Walmart International operated 6,300 stores in 26 countries. =CEO of Walmart, Inc. (2014‚Äìpresent)= McMillon speaks from the White House Rose Garden on the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020 Walmart announced on November 25, 2013, that McMillon would immediately join the company's board of directors, and would replace Mike Duke as Walmart CEO effective on February 1, 2014, becoming the company's fifth chief executive. McMillon took over the company at a time of slowing growth and increased competition from rivals, such as Costco, Amazon.com, grocery store chains Kroger and Safeway, and discount chains of small stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General. Within his first two years as chief executive, McMillon raised wages for hourly workers in the US, boosted the company's commitment to e-commerce and revamped Walmart's executive team. While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon argued that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service, as well as a better footing in a changing retail market. In February 2015, McMillon announced Walmart would invest an additional in higher associate wages, benefits and training, including raising its lowest wage to an hour in 2015 and an hour for 2016. The action affected 40 percent of the company's 1.4million US workers. In January 2016, McMillon announced raises for the majority of its workers, free basic short-term disability for full- time workers and a revised paid time off program. McMillon made it a long-term goal of Walmart to increase investments in e-commerce, stressing a need to create a \\"seamless shopping experience\\". As such he announced in 2015 that Walmart would invest on its online operations. Another goal is to improve the company's environmental sustainability and eliminate waste across the company. In 2014, Walmart began rolling out an initiative to replace lighting in its stores in the US, UK, Latin America and Asia with LED lights for energy efficiency. At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, McMillon said Walmart would press three of its main goals: supply the company with renewable energy, eliminate waste and promote sustainably packaged goods. As CEO, McMillon sought to make a \\"positive difference\\" in other issues. On March 31, 2015, McMillon issued a statement urging Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the state's \\"religious freedom\\" bill. McMillon said the bill \\"threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold\\". In June 2015, McMillon said the company would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise following the shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. McMillon altered Walmart's gun sales. He told CNNMoney in an interview that Walmart's selection of firearms should be geared towards hunters and sports shooters. In August 2015, the company ceased sales of military-style semiautomatic weapons. Forbes named McMillon to its World's Most Powerful People list in 2014, 2015 and 2016 where he ranked No.29, No.32, No.27 respectively. ExecRank ranked McMillon No.4 on its 2015 list of top CEOs for large companies. In December 2016, McMillon joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues. In August 2017, McMillon wrote a rebuke of President Trump's response to the violent protests Charlottesville, Virginia in an email to all employees and on the internal company website that is viewable by the public. The statement said the President, \\"missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together\\". A company spokesman said McMillon would continue to serve on a presidential advisory council on economic development. In September 2019, McMillion announced that the company would no longer sell ammunition used for handguns and military-style weapons. This policy update came as a result of the mass shooting which took place at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas in August 2019. McMillion's actions to create a dialogue and take actions around the issue, set a new precedent for how corporations and their leaders address these matters. Personal life McMillon lives with his wife, Shelley, in Bentonville, Arkansas. They have two sons.

It is dated from the second half of the second century BC and is some two hundred years younger than the other piece made in Attica. The grave relief comes from the area around Smyrna (modern Izmir) and was acquired through the mediation of Carl Humann. It originated in Hellenistic times in Ionia, where, unlike in Attica, such funerary luxury was not prohibited. The two inhabitants of the grave are depicted on the relief and named in an inscription.Inschriften von Smyrna 152. Eutaxia stands at left, the daughter of Hermon, while her husband Artemisios, son of Menekrates is at right. The decoration of the relief is informed by common forms of representation. Eutaxia is depicted in her garments and leans against the left wall. She holds an arm in front of her stomach, in the other hand she supports her head. The left leg is exposed almost to knee height under the cloak. A little servant figure stands with a pyxis in her hand, on the left side between the wall and Eutaxia. The faces of both figures have been knocked off. Artemisios rests his weight on his left leg; his right leg is free and leans to the left. He has his hands crossed in front of his stomach. He is dressed in a thick cape and an even smaller servant figure stands at his feet on the right. Above the proper field, there is an architectural imitation of a Greek tomb building.

The first part of the book argues in detail for philosophical anarchism and refutes the legitimacy of political authority, while the second addresses political anarchism and the practical viability of anarcho-capitalism. History and promotion In April 2011, while he was still writing the book (then titled Freedom and Authority), Huemer was profiled by the Arts and Sciences Magazine of the University of Colorado, Boulder. The profile quoted Huemer as saying that political authority is \\"a moral illusion we‚Äôre suffering from.\\" In May 2012, a few months prior to the publication of the book, Huemer defended the argument of the book in a video. Reception Ole Martin Moen of the University of Oslo, Norway, reviewed the book in Philosophical Quarterly. Moen concluded his review by writing: \\"In addition to being a solid scholarly work, Huemer‚Äôs book will work well as assigned reading in classes on political philosophy. It is bound to spark debate, and its inclusion would help remedy the sad fact that anarchism is often either ignored or put aside without serious engagement. This is a pity, for even if one rejects his conclusions, Huemer makes it clear that anarchism is a sophisticated theory that deserves careful consideration.\\" The book has also been reviewed in Ethics by George Klosko, Mind by Daniel Viehoff, and Le Qu√©b√©cois Libre by Bradley Doucet.

The property includes one of the oldest houses in Chilmark, a barn dating from the 1780s, and facilities constructed primarily during the 1920s by the Chilmark Associates to facilitate its use as a summer retreat. The property represents aspects of the island's development from its agrarian origins to a summer vacation destination. History English settlement of the island of Martha's Vineyard began in 1641. One early settler in what is now Chilmark, Massachusetts was Nathan Skiffe, who established a sheep farm in 1686. The raising of sheep continued to be a major business in Chilmark into the 19th century, and his property continued to be used for that purpose by descendants and extended family members into the early 20th century. Skiffe built a house on the property in about 1690. Evidence indicates that some of the timbers used in its construction may have been recycled from other structures, likely hauled from elsewhere on the island. In addition to the house, the only major structure to survive into the 20th century is a barn, dated to the 1780s. In 1919 Gertrude King acquired , including the house and barn, on behalf of a group friends who eventually organized as the Chilmark Associates. This group of well-to-do liberal artists, writers, and activists sought to adapt the property for use as a communal summer retreat. To this end they adapted the barn for use as a dining and meeting center for their community, and constructed a series of cabins in which to live. In 1927 they formally named the property \\"Barn House\\". The membership of the Chilmark Associates fluctuated over time. Notable members and guests included journalist Walter Lippman, jurist Felix Frankfurter, judge and political activist Dorothy Kenyon, painter Thomas Hart Benton, and poet Sylvia Plath. District elements Barn House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. The district's contributing elements include the following buildings: * Barn House, c. 1690 * Barn, c. 1786 * A shed, c. 1850 * Seven cabins, constructed between 1920 and 1959 The following resources also contribute: * The property's stone walls, which appear to date to the 18th century * A stone-slab culvert over a stream, dating to the 19th century Non-contributing resources in the district include a tennis court and bath house, as well as a c. 2001 cabin.

She was best known for her recordings in the 1960s, including the first released recording of the song \\"For Once in My Life\\". Biography Born in Detroit, she sang in church as a child, and later entered and won local talent contests. She turned professional at 15, and began performing in nightclubs. She was influenced by Dinah Washington, and on one occasion was confronted by an angry Washington who accused her of copying her. She studied at the Detroit Conservatory, and attracted the attention of music business agent John Levy, the manager of singer Nancy Wilson. He won DuShon singing engagements across the US, and after he and Wilson had a row vowed that he would make DuShon a bigger star than she was. However, she then married Freddie Atwell, who became her manager, and they relocated to New York City. Ralph McNight, \\"Jean DuShon: A Lifetime of Blues on the Road\\", All About Jazz, 2 March 2007.

Retrieved November 25, 2013 While with Cadet, she was contacted by Motown songwriter Ron Miller, with a song he had co-written, \\"For Once in My Life\\". She recorded the song, with arrangement by Bart Keyes and production by Esmond Edwards. The single was issued by Cadet in October 1966, became a local hit, and has been described as \\"a beauty, capped by soaring modulations that glimmer with the hopefulness of love\\". However, on hearing it and discovering that Miller was the co-writer, Berry Gordy asked Chess not to promote it, and had the song recorded by Connie Haines, Barbara McNair, and later Stevie Wonder whose recording became a worldwide hit. After one further single, DuShon then left Chess and did not record subsequently. She later said of the failure of \\"For Once in My Life\\": > It was a very big disappointment in my life.

The cascade of events in the inflammatory pathway that result from cell membrane disruption is well documented. The release of membrane phospholipids leads to increased production of arachidonic acid which in turn results in elevated leukotriene, prostaglandin and thromboxane production. The ingredients in Azerizin are known to inhibit each of these three major paths of inflammation by blocking or down-regulating pro-inflammatory catalysts at multiple points in the inflammatory cascade, e.g., inhibition of phospholipase, lipooxygenase, COX-2, leukotrienes, thromboxane, prostaglandins, nitric oxide, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-12. In addition to these anti-inflammatory actions, the components of Azerizin possess potent antimicrobial activity against Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermis, at least in part attributed to inhibition of microbial cellular protein synthesis. Azerizin was developed at Elorac for use as an adjunct in the management of acne vulgaris and rosacea.

As part of 40th Anti-Aircraft Brigade it defended air bases in East Anglia through the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. Towards the end of 1944 the unit underwent infantry training, serving briefly in Norway at the end of the war. After the war, the 36th continued as a TA unit, with some women serving with it. In 1961, the remnants of the regiment amalgamated with others to form a combined infantry battalion, and all links with air defence were severed. 90 cm 'Projector Anti- Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth.

The regiment had its origins in 317 (Middlesex) Independent Anti-Aircraft Searchlight Company, one of a number of air defence companies of the Royal Engineers formed in the Home counties by the Territorial Army during 1924. 317 AASL Company, based at Hendon, was grouped with two companies from Kent in the Kent & Middlesex Group.Monthly Army List, 1924‚Äì39.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 109‚Äì14.

In October 1935 the Kent & Middlesex Grpup became 29th (Kent) AA Battalion, RE and on 15 December 1935 317 Company was separated and expanded into a full battalion as the 36th (Middlesex) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers (TA). The battalion raised three new companies, 344 at Harrow, 345 at Edgware and 346 at Southall. It formed part of 29th (East Anglian) Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Major Edward Boggis, MBE, was transferred from 26th (London) Air Defence Brigade Signals, Royal Corps of Signals, to be Officer Commanding 344th AA Company. Sir John Perring was reappointed Honorary Colonel of the new unit.Frederick, pp. 858, 860, 865. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. On 1 November 1938, 344 AA Company was detached to form the cadre for a duplicate unit, which became 58th (Middlesex) AA Bn, RE, under the command of Lt-Col Boggis, while 36th AA Bn began raising a new 424 AA Company.Monthly Army List, January 1939. World War II =Mobilisation= Formation sign of 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti- Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. By the outbreak of war, 36th (Middlesex) AA Bn had moved to Edgware and it formed part of 40th Anti-Aircraft Brigade in 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division.

In common with other RE searchlight battalions, the unit was transferred to the Royal Artillery on 1 August 1940, becoming 36th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment RA (TA), and the companies were termed batteries.Litchfield, p. 178.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339. At this time, AA Command was heavily engaged in the Battle of Britain, in which 40th AA Bde was responsible for guarding airfields in East Anglia. This was soon followed by the night-bombing campaign of The Blitz, in which searchlights were a key element in the defences.2 AA Div at RA 39‚Äì45 Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. In November 1940 AA Command changed its S/L layouts to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or Royal Air Force (RAF) Night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with Searchlight Control radar (SLC) and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Routledge, p. 393.Farndale, p. 107. In early 1941, 36 S/L Rgt sent a cadre of experienced men to 236 S/L Training Rgt at Oswestry, where they formed 542nd S/L Bty with recruits mainly from London. This battery then formed part of 89th S/L Rgt, which was later converted into 133rd Light AA Rgt, and fought in the North West Europe campaign.89 S/L Rgt War Diary 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/3109.Frederick, p. 861. =Mid-War= 36th (Middlesex) S/L Regiment remained in 40th AA Brigade in 2nd AA Division (later 5th AA Group) for much of the war.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84. In September 1943 it transferred within 5th AA Group to 50th AA Brigade. 50th AA Brigade HQ was then transferred to 21st Army Group preparing for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord); 36th S/L Rgt remained in AA Command and came under 27th (Home Counties) AA Brigade from January 1944. With the lower threat of attack by the weakened Luftwaffe, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for Overlord, and all Home Defence searchlight regiments were reduced by a battery. 424 S/L Battery commenced disbandment on 7 February 1944, completing by 28 February.

At the same time, 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2. In January 1945, the War Office began to reorganise surplus anti-aircraft and coastal artillery regiments in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380.Infantry Regiments RA at RA 39‚Äì45 27th (Home Counties) AA Brigade was one of the HQs selected for conversion, becoming 303rd Infantry Brigade on 22 January 1945.

He is sometimes described as \\"the father of hereditary cancer detection and prevention\\" or the \\"father of cancer genetics\\", although Lynch himself said that title should go to the early 20th century pathologist Aldred Scott Warthin. Lynch was the chairman of preventive medicine at Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Nebraska and held the Charles F. and Mary C. Heider Endowed Chair in Cancer Research. Early life and education Lynch was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts and grew up in New York City. He dropped out of high school at 14 and joined the U. S. Navy at age 16, using false identification to disguise his age. He served as a gunner during World War II. After his discharge in 1946 he became a professional boxer under the nickname \\"Hammerin' Hank\\". After obtaining a high school equivalency, he received a bachelor's degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1951 and a master's degree in clinical psychology from the University of Denver in 1952. He studied for a Ph.D. in human genetics from the University of Texas at Austin and received an M.D. from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston in 1960. He interned at St. Mary's Hospital in Evansville, Indiana and completed a residency in internal medicine at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine. Career He served as an assistant professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, then joined the faculty at Creighton University in 1967. Noting that some cancer patients had relatives and ancestors with the same type of cancer, Lynch postulated that cancer could be hereditary. He began to focus his research on that possibility, although it was considered unlikely by the medical establishment of the time, which was focused on environmental causes of cancer; in fact the American Cancer Society frequently stated that cancer was not hereditary. In 1970 he applied for a research grant from the National Institutes of Health, citing a family in which numerous members had colon cancer, but the grant application was rejected, as were most of his other grant applications over the following 20 years. He persisted, compiling data and statistics that demonstrated patterns of \\"cancer syndromes\\" through multiple generations of families. He defined the necessary criteria for a genetic cancer: early age of onset of the disease, specific pattern of multiple primary cancers, and Mendelian patterns of inheritance in hundreds of extended families worldwide. His theory of genetically based cancers was eventually accepted. His best-known example, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, is the most common form of hereditary colorectal cancer and is generally known as Lynch syndrome. He demonstrated the Mendelian inheritance pattern for certain breast and ovarian cancers, which laid the groundwork for the identification of specific genes responsible for these familial cancers, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. In 1984 he established the Hereditary Cancer Prevention Clinic at Creighton, which focuses on identifying risk factors, promoting early detection, and preventing the onset of familial cancers. Under his leadership Creighton also hosts a High Risk Registry, part of the Early Detection Research Network sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. The Registry allows the Network to educate individual patients about their genetic risk status.

She further contributed studies to the Island Ecosystems Integrated Research Program of the U. S. International Biological Program (Stoner et al., 1975).  Early life and education Baker was born on July 22, 1908, in Iowa City, Iowa to Richard Phillip Baker of England and Katherine Riedelbauch of the United States (Green et al., 2009). Gladys' mother was of German descent and taught music at Lamar College in Missouri, living in a boardinghouse. Here she met Gladys' father teaching secondary school and music while preparing for the bar exam. In 1901, Katherine and Richard both left Lamar College for Anna Illinois Academy, later marrying on February 22, 1902 in Glasford, Illinois (Green et al., 2009). Richard Baker constructed a business making and marketing three-dimensional mathematical models. In 1905, Richard began teaching mathematics at the University of Iowa while pursuing both a physics and mathematics doctorate at the University of Chicago. Katherine cared for their two daughters, Gladys and Frances, kept a garden of flowers, and maintained the artistically and musically enriched living environment of the Baker household. Gladys referred to her sheltered, yet intellectually stimulating childhood with the constant presence of ‚Äúmusic, books, and interesting conversations with the family and visitors, all combining to make it a perfect environment in which to grow‚Äù. In 1926, Baker graduated with honors from Iowa City High School, and subsequently toured around Europe with her older sister, Frances. Frances received her doctorate from the University of Chicago, later teaching mathematics at Mount Holyoke College and Vassar College (Green et. al., 2009). Baker majored in history and botany, and minored in zoology for her undergraduate studies at the University of Iowa in 1930 (Green et al., 2009). She continued in academics for a master's degree in mycology and minor in embryology at the University of Iowa under the guidance of mycologist G.W. Martin. In 1931, Baker spent a summer at the Friday Harbor Marine Lab of the University of Washington, researching invertebrate zoology and marine phytoplankton. Career After graduating and having her master's thesis work on the morphological study of myxomycete fructifications published in 1933 by the University of Iowa Studies in Natural History, T.H. McBride employed her as a staff biological artist. Baker then drew illustrations for T.H. McBride's and G.W. Martin's 1934 publication, the worldwide monograph of ‚ÄúThe Myxomycetes‚Äù presently published by Macmillan Company of New York City. Shortly after in 1933, Baker went on to earn a doctorate in mycology at Washington University in St. Louis under the direction and guidance of Carroll W. Dodge (Green et al., 2009). Awarded the Jessie R. Barr Fellowship, Baker studied general mycology, as well as medical mycology for two years, spending her postdoctoral year in the Botany Department at Washington University. During this year, she studied unique specimens of lichens and the interactions with their parasites obtained during a controversial Antarctic expedition. Baker also conducted a significant monographic study of the genus Helicogloea from 1933 to 1935. In the middle of her monographic research in 1934, she was elected a member of Sigma Xi at Washington University, and continually cherished her father's Sigma Xi pin. Resigning from her post doctorate position in order to teach, Baker started teaching in the Biology Department at Hunter College in New York in 1936. During her four years there, she rekindled her passion for music. Throughout her time at Vassar College beginning in 1940, Baker served as chair of the Plant Science Department for thirteen years, directing three graduate students as well. She later began teaching the first course ever in medical mycology, and became a charter member of the Medical Mycological Society of the Americas and a fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1938 (‚ÄúMartin-Baker Award‚Äù 2013). In 1945, she studied the emerging medically and commercially important genus of Aspergillus, gearing her research toward medical fungi (Baker 1945). Following her departure from Vassar, Baker traveled to the University of Hawaii, at Manoa, and taught at the institution from 1961 to 1973, as well as conducted many fungal isolation projects (Baker 1968). She oversaw the work of thirteen graduate students for advanced degrees in general and medical mycology (Baker 1977). Her students have described Baker as ‚Äúan effective and enthusiastic teacher,‚Äù a mycologist and scientist with the ‚Äúhighest integrity,‚Äù and a ‚Äúwarm and caring friend‚Äù (‚ÄúMartin-Baker Award‚Äù, 2013). Fellow scientists and peer mycologists continue to admire the relics of her memorable work, including the twenty-one illustrated plates for MacBride and Martin, The Myxomycetes (1934), the nuclear behavior and monographic studies of the genus Penicillium and Helicogloea (Baker 1944), The Antarctic Lichens (1938) with C.W. Dodge, and the cytology and ecology of microfungi. They also remember her as ‚Äúa lady of many interests and talents, all executed with a style consistent with the English traditions of her father.\\" Baker retired in Sun City, Arizona after her time at the University of Hawaii, at Manoa in 1973, surrounded by a culture-enriched environment. Music, distinguished novels, southwestern Indian culture, Chinese art treasures, and gardens filled her home in combination with her early childhood influences and present pursuits. Baker continued to write using her old typewriter, eventually authoring an autobiography (Dunn et al., 2009). Death Baker died on July 7, 2007, aged 98 at her home in Peoria, Arizona.  Musical life  Baker had cultivated a passion for music early in life, influenced by her musical parents and the choral household she grew up in. Her parents, Katherine and Richard, together established and performed with Iowa City's first chamber music ensemble (Green et al., 2009). In 1936, while teaching in the Biology Department at Hunter College in New York, she belonged to the New York Ontario Society, a choir performing music in the Ontario style that continues to present annual performances of Handel's Messiah at Carnegie Hall.

It was one of three Byzantine-period castles that defended the island before the Venetian era (1386‚Äì1797). The castles formed a defensive triangle, with Gardiki guarding the island's south, Kassiopi the northeast and Angelokastro the northwest. Its position at the northeastern coast of Corfu overseeing the Corfu Channel that separates the island from the mainland gave the castle an important vantage point and an elevated strategic significance. Kassiopi Castle is considered one of the most imposing architectural remains in the Ionian Islands, along with Angelokastro, Gardiki Castle and the two Venetian Fortresses of Corfu City, the Citadel and the New Fort. Origins View of the castle in 1688 The exact origins of the castle are not clear, with various theories being advanced, but they appear to be Byzantine. During excavations in the two towers adjacent to the main gate as well as in a third tower to the north side of the main gate, bronze coins from the reigns of Byzantine emperors Maurice (582‚Äì602 AD) and Basil II (976‚Äì1025) were discovered. In addition ceramic ostraca dating from the early Byzantine period, the 4th‚Äì7th centuries AD, were also unearthed. This leads to the conclusion that a Byzantine castle may have been built in the area by the 6th century AD, a date which is several centuries earlier than the currently estimated date of the present castle's construction. History Kassiopi Castle as viewed from the port of Kassiopi In 1081 Count Bohemund of Taranto conquered the castle at the start of the first Norman invasion of Greece. In 1084 the fortress fell into the hands of Alexios I Komnenos after he defeated the Norman fleet following three naval battles in the Corfu Channel. In 1267 the Angevins took over the castle and in 1386 the castle fell to the Venetians after some initial resistance. =Destruction and neglect by the Venetians= Kassiopi Castle renovations during modern times The Venetians ordered the destruction of the castle because its defenders resisted their takeover of Corfu in 1386 and did not willingly surrender. The Venetians subsequently dismantled it, fearing it could be captured by their enemies, or by the locals, and used against them. Even in later times they did not repair or maintain it, in contrast to their efforts at strengthening Angelokastro and the Old Fortress of Corfu. The consequence of the Venetian action was that during the Turkish sieges of Corfu in 1537 and 1716 the local people who could not escape were slaughtered or enslaved. There is also evidence provided by famous Venetian architects Michele Sanmicheli and his son Giangerolamo Sanmicheli that, while under contract to the Venetians to reinforce the Old Fortress of Corfu during the Ottoman inter-siege period of 1537‚Äì1558, they carried materials from Kassiopi Castle to the citadel for their repairs. Detail of the south wing of the entrance at Kassiopi Castle After the 1669 Venetian surrender of Candia in Crete to the Ottomans, Corfu became the last Venetian possession and bastion in the Levante. Consequently, the Venetians redoubled their efforts at strengthening the defences of the island. In 1671 a Venetian official by the name of Dona was sent to evaluate the defences of Corfu and submit a plan to the Venetian Senate. Donna went in situ to Kassiopi to evaluate the castle and its prospects of defending Corfu from the Ottomans who were planning an invasion of the island from Epirus. Dona went along with Venetian special commander of the Adriatic, and future Doge of Venice, Mocenigo. Based on further advice by general St. Andrea and military engineer Verneda, Dona's report to the Venetian Senate supported the strengthening of the Kassiopi Fortress. Despite Dona's advice the Venetians abandoned all plans of defending Kassiopi. A century after the castle's destruction, folk tales developed of fire-breathing dragons who had destroyed the castle and poisoned the people of the village. The genesis of these myths is attributed to the impression the use of black powder and explosions made to the area residents who were unfamiliar with these advances in military warfare. Following the second great siege of Corfu in 1716, the Venetians finally decided to rebuild the castle, although the local population had already moved to other places including villages on the highlands of Mount Pantokrator. Architecture Gardens of Kassiopi Castle Kassiopi from the castle walls The main gate of the castle is protected by strong fore-walls (). This arrangement is similar to other castles and structures found in Epirus, such as the Castle of Riza and the Monastery of Kato Vassiliki. The perimeter of the castle has a length of 1.073 km and is of a quadrilateral shape with 19 strong towers of alternating circular and rectangular cross sections guarding the walls and runs in the southwest to northeast direction. The interior of the castle has an area of 35,177 m2 and is empty of any structures although filled with olive trees. The central tower of the castle has disappeared but the main gate exists and is supported by two strong towers on either side. Each of the gate towers has two floors and the gate features protective wall extensions which restrict access from the sides, a feature which is designed to prevent surprise ambush from an enemy hiding at the side of the gate. The ambush avoidance feature is further augmented by the terrain which slopes upward at the gate. The thickness of the wall at the gate is 1.9 m. There are ruins of a forewall in front of the gate which could have functioned as an installation of a large iron structure which would have secured the gate. There are indications that both strong towers at each side of the gate had installations that facilitated the movement of the iron gate closure. The defence of the castle was mainly achieved through warfare from the battlements, although no battlement structures survive. The shape of the battlements is uncertain and although in artistic representations they look like the letter \\"M\\", it is still not known if that representation is simply the artist's imagination. Rear view of the main gate complex Since the walls of the castle are vertical, and not inclined so that cannon projectiles could bounce off them, the design was meant to repulse conventional siege machinery developed prior to the advent of artillery. Such conventional equipment would have included ladders, siege towers, and battering rams. The overall design of the castle is modest and characteristic of its provincial origin. The rectangular towers are older than the cylindrical ones and there are indications that the technology of the cylindrical towers may have been belatedly introduced to the fortress, given its rural and provincial location. Since the castle was abandoned for a long time, its structure is in a state of ruin. The eastern side of the fort has disappeared and only a few traces of it remain. There are indications that castle stones have been used as building material for houses in the area. Access to the fortress is mainly from the southeast through a narrow walkway which includes passage from homes and backyards, since the castle is at the centre of the densely built area of the small village of Kassiopi.

In 2000, the US Department of State decided to accept some South Sudanese into the US who were refugees of war. In 2001 a group of young South Sudanese refugees (mostly of the Nuer and Dinka ethnic groupsLost Boys of Sudan, official IRC website.) moved to the US. They were called the Lost Boys of Sudan, a group that was established that year. Approximately 3800 Lost Boys were allowed to resettle in the US in 2001. These youths mobilized the South Sudanese community of the cities, forming a South Sudanese association and increasing its visibility. They were brought as child war refugees from South Sudan to parts of the US, including Michigan, Chicago and Omaha, dispersed among 38 cities.

Many Sudanese residents there have opened grocery stores which sell traditional Sudanese food. The number of South Sudanese refugees who emigrate to Omaha has decreased due to the official end of the civil war in Sudan as of July 2012. South Sudanese continue to travel to Omaha, because of the South Sudanese community there, as well as for labor opportunities and affordable housing. Moreover, when the economy fell in Nebraska, many South Sudanese from there migrated to other places such as Anchorage, Alaska, where about 1,000 people of South Sudanese origin live. A South Sudanese school was created there that teaches the Nuer language, so that this South Sudanese language is not lost in the US. = Work and education = South Sudanese refugees moved to the US fleeing the religious and political persecution, warfare, and starvation which were produced by the Sudanese civil war. Many Sudanese or South Sudanese moved to America also for educational and vocational opportunities or for family reunification. Although many of them had thought about returning to Sudan eventually to fight for the political cause of South Sudan, many of them end up staying in the US permanently to send money to their families and to increase knowledge about the South Sudan situation. The \\"Lost Boys\\" were dedicated to jobs such as accounting, engineering, carpentry and masonry, crop and animal husbandry, social and humanitarian work, and education, but many South Sudanese, despite having those experiences in Sudan, had to devote to food service, retail, hospitals, hotels, and airport security. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the Sudanese are relatively well-educated. One-third of them have a college degree and one-third attended college. Thus, some South Sudanese achieved higher U.S. labor positions. Some institutes in places like Chicago prepare some South Sudanese clergy. = Culture = Most of the people of South Sudan in the United States are Christian, as are most people of the country. They are mostly Episcopalians, although some are Roman Catholic. Many South Sudanese tribes also live in the US. Most South Sudanese established in US belong to the Nuer, Dinka and Azande ethnic groups. Other South Sudanese ethnic groups resettled in US are the Anuak, Shilluk, Moru, Madi, and Acholi. In Omaha live 10 Sudanese tribes (such as the Nuer, Dinka, Bari, Azande and Maban people), In Maine there are 17 tribes (with around 2,000 Sudanese in total, between them, the Acholi tribe). Most of the Lost Boys of the South Sudan belonged to Dinka people; included, between others, in the United States, Nuer and Mora. The South Sudanese created community networks and they celebrate May 16, a holiday that commemorates the day in 1983 when the separatists in South Sudan first organized anti-government north.  Organizations  In 1997 was founded The Southern Sudanese Community Association (SSCA), a non-profit organization whose goal is provide an education at a basic level (case management, learning English, household budgeting, understanding currency and money, new cultural ways and social norms, transportation, and driver's education) for refugees in Omaha. Since its founding, the organization has helped more than 1,311 families originating from southern Sudan. Later, after the Southern Sudanese Community Association and due to the difficulty of South Sudanese Americans to study in universities, a South Sudanese immigrant, Valentino, created the Valentino Achak Deng Foundation, which aims to help provide scholarships to aid the educational pursuits of South Sudanese Americans, support educational institutions and community organizations that work with South Sudanese immigrants. This foundation makes grants to American colleges and universities for scholarship funds to assist South Sudanese students enrolled in degree programs.

Located atop a prominent Ohio River vantage point, it has been named a historic site. History Thomas Carneal was among the first men of early Kenton County. He established his name as one of the founders of the nearby city of Covington,Parrish, Charles E. '. National Park Service, 1972-07-14. where in 1816 he built the city's first brick house. Both the Covington house (now known as the Carneal House) and Elmwood Hall dominate the surrounding neighborhoods like manor houses. When the city of Ludlow was founded, it was a planned community whose owners had conceived a detailed plan for the whole settlement, with the goal of drawing √©lite residents. If Carneal's plan were to contribute to this goal by setting community standards with his two houses, he failed in Ludlow, but he succeeded in Covington, where his residence today sits at the core of the Riverside Drive Historic District. During some of the house's earliest years, it was home to a locally prominent politician; Carneal won election to the Kentucky General Assembly later in his life. Since that time, the house has served a range of purposes: among its other residents have been English naturalist William Bullock and Israel Ludlow, whose father Israel was the city's namesake and had helped to found Cincinnati. Architecture Designed by nationally prominent architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe,Schrand, Eugene F. Written Historical and Descriptive Data: Elmwood Hall , Historic American Buildings Survey, 1937-03-10. Accessed 2013-11-24. Elmwood Hall sits atop a hill, and from its octagonal cupola and widow's walk, one may see many miles along the Ohio River either to the east or to the west. The house's front faces the river to the north, featuring a grand double door with fanlight, sidelights, a tall staircase, and carven trim, but all of the house's other sides also include extensive detailing. Both sides encompass porches with railings and six narrow columns. The building is topped with a hip roof rising to the widow's walk, which is surrounded by a railing identical to the ones found on the porches. Extensive original woodworking survives without substantial changes, and virtually all other woodwork, including the doors and the window frames, also remain with little damage. Some of the original exterior walls have been modified; for example, some of the brick exterior walls have been covered with cement plaster, while the western porch has been converted into a bay window in order to expand the interior space, although the original columns have been saved. The foundation is of limestone, carefully dressed. Like the exterior walls, most of the interior walls are brick, while some framing is yellow poplar with occasional pine floorboards in addition to the extensive ash on the floors and in the lintels. Preservation By the late twentieth century, the house had been converted for commercial use, becoming the offices of the Thomas Candy Company. Despite the radical change in its uses, the house remains in fine condition. Although the original ash floors are no longer easily visible, this is purely because of a protective covering that the candy company installed to prevent damage from foot traffic and its machinery. In recognition of its exceptional degree of preservation, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in August 1972; it was the second location in Kenton County to be given this distinction, although more than sixty different locations in the county now possess it, including the Riverside Drive Historic District in which Carneal's other house is located. In 2019, the Kentucky Historical Society will install a historical marker at the site.

It is the fourth volume of Roberts's SPQR series, featuring Senator Decius Metellus. Plot summary 60 BC: Decius Metellus the Younger accompanies his relative Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus on a diplomatic mission to Alexandria. The assignment is a polite form of exile, since his mortal enemy Clodius, is currently politically ascendant in Rome. Decius's friend Rufus assures him that he will enjoy himself, since Alexandria is a beautiful city and King Ptolemy's court always goes to absurd lengths to flatter and pamper Roman visitors, especially those of Senatorial rank. About a month after his arrival, Decius is pleasantly surprised to welcome his fiancee, Julia (Julius Caesar's niece) and her friend, Cornelia Fausta (the dictator Sulla's daughter). Because of her fascination with scholarship, Decius allows Julia to drag him on a guided tour of the famous library. While she is listening to a lecture, Decius wanders into the Temple of the Muses attached to the Library and is struck by its simple beauty and unpretentious veneration of art, literature, and music. Decius is usually not a spiritual man, but both Julia and Decius's slave Hermes notice him walking around in a daze after visiting the Temple. While Decius and Julia are attending a formal dinner for the scholars at the Library, an outcry is raised when one of them, a mathematician named Iphicrates, is found murdered in his chambers. Decius's friend, the physician Asklepiodes, determines that Iphicrates was struck in the head by the blunt side of a ceremonial axe, commonly used for sacrificial ceremonies in the nearby temples. Decius finds signs that Iphicrates was actually killed inside the Temple before being dragged into his chambers. The next morning, he asks King Ptolemy for formal authority to investigate the crime. Following Iphicrates's recent movements leads Decius and Hermes up the Nile to a secret military camp where a number of bizarre-looking siege engines are being tested by a detachment of Ptolemy's own Macedonian guards. Remembering a visit by himself and Julia to Iphicrates's quarters while the philosopher was alive, Decius notices the absence of a rare book, which the librarian identifies as a manual on siege engines, the Library's only copy. Decius confides his suspicions to Creticus that someone in Egypt is preparing to rebel against Rome. Creticus dismisses his fears, but matters take a turn for the worse when \\"Baal-Ahriman\\", the deity of a religious cult that is the latest fad in Alexandria thanks to Princess Berenice's patronage, issues an oracular statement that soon the Egyptian people will take back their land and expel the hated \\"barbarians\\" (i.e., the Romans). The Roman embassy attached to the royal palace barricades itself against an angry mob. Decius receives a message from a hetaireia who services the Parthian ambassador, claiming to have knowledge of the plot and offering to meet him in the local necropolis. But when Decius arrives, she is dead, and he is arrested by the local authorities for murder. Creticus obtains his release from prison, but insists that he stay inside the embassy. Defying these orders, Decius sneaks into the city and visits the house the murder victim mentioned. Hiding under a bed, he overhears a secret conclave between Ataxes (the high priest of the cult of Baal- Ahriman), the Parthian ambassador, and Achillas, the King's Guard commander. Achillas is preparing a revolt against Rome, to be coordinated with a new offensive by the Parthians against Syria. The Parthians are confident in their ability to defeat any Roman army sent against them on the open field, but are worried about the Romans' expertise in siege warfare; to secure their cooperation, Achillas promised them the schematics and prototypes of the new war machines designed by Iphicrates. With Ataxes's help, \\"Baal-Ahriman\\" will announce to the Egyptian mob that Princess Berenice's soon-to-be-born child is actually divine, allowing her to usurp the King and pronounce her child the new heir, with Achillas acting as regent. Achillas killed Iphicrates when he refused to release the book, which had the secret treaty between Achillas and Parthia hidden in its pages, for delivery to the ambassador. Decius makes his way back to the embassy, but is caught by Ataxes. Decius threatens to reveal that he is a fraud, but Ataxes turns the tables by killing a stray cat and loudly claiming Decius is the killer, which incites a riot. Decius barely makes it back to the palace, and reveals the plot to Creticus and the King. Achillas, called in, calmly denies the charges and says that, since Ataxes was killed in the riot, there is no proof. Ptolemy, conscious that Achillas's family is too powerful for him to take direct action, sends him on a prolonged \\"inspection tour\\" to the upriver garrisons. Before departing, Achillas confronts Decius in private and asks why he would care so much about the death of Iphicrates. Decius's answer is simple: Achillas profaned the Temple of the Muses by committing murder inside it. As soon as he re-enters the embassy, Decius is ambushed, gagged and bound by the other Romans, who plan to ship him to Rhodes before he can cause any more trouble. Julia promises to follow him shortly. Writing in his memoirs, Decius adds that he finally settled his score with Achillas years later, when he returned to Egypt with Caesar (during the latter's famous mediation between Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra).

One of his academic achievements is the discovery of a new jasmonate which enhances resistance against external stress of the crop. Choi is currently professor at Seoul National University in South Korea.  Biography  Choi Yang-do was born in Seoul, South Korea. He studied agricultural chemistry at Seoul National University (1972-1976) and graduated with a BS degree. From 1976 to 1978 he received a MS degree in biological science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology from 1981 to 1985 at Northwestern University in Evanston.  Researches  Choi researched jasmonates, which are believed to participate in signal transduction processes between external stresses, such as wounding, pathogenic attack, or cell response by activating the defense genes. He discovered a new enzyme, (EC2.1.1.141) jasmonate carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT), which catalyzes the methylation of jasmonate to MeJA. The overexpression of the JMT gene confers resistance to pathogens. He is currently working to understand the molecular function of MeJA, JMT, and its effector genes. Furthermore, the genetic engineering of crops by application of those genes and knowledge is under investigation. The major research activity is the discovery of a novel enzyme and its genes encoding jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, which is involved in stress response and signal transduction in plant. Other achievements are the development of drought tolerant transgenic rice and transferred technology to Mahyco, India and the development of yield-enhanced transgenic rice and transferred technologies to BASF Plant Science in Germany. Awards For his scientific achievements Choi received the New Technology Development Award from the Ministry of Science & Technology (1992), the Special Award from Korean Society for Molecular & Cell Biology from the Korean Society of Molecular and Cellular Biology (1999), the 11th Sangrok Agriculture & Life Science Award from Seoul National University College of Agriculture (2002), the Excellent Monograph Award from the Korean Federation for Science & Technology Societies (2003), the 11th Hwanong Award from Hwanong Academy & Research Foundation (2004), the KSABC Award from the Korean Society for Applied Biology and Chemistry (2006), the 52nd NAS Award from the National Academy of Sciences, and the Most Outstanding Korean Scientist and Engineer Award from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology & Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies (2008).

It is located in fare Zone A, in the Plaza de Isabel II, in the central district of Madrid. The station provides access to an area with tourist landmarks such as Teatro Real, Plaza de Oriente and the Royal Palace. Its name comes from nearby Madrid opera house, the Teatro Real.  History  The station was opened to the public on 21 October, 1925 on line 2. and Ramal later that year. Its original name was Isabel II, under the square in which it stood. The platforms of lines 2 and Ramal are located at the same level, the former is 60 m long and the latter being shorter in the beginning, but later it was extended in length to 60 m, too. After the proclamation of the Second Republic on 14 April 1931, the new authorities approved by Decree of 20 April the removal of all the denominations that made references to the monarchy. Therefore, on 24 June Isabel II station was renamed √ìpera. That year, the square was renamed \\"Ferm√≠n Gal√°n\\", after one of the leaders of the failed uprising in 1930 that tried to overthrow King Alfonso XIII. On 5 June 1937 the station changed its name to coincide with the square. However, after the establishment of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco there was a further change in the names of city streets, stations, etc. Therefore, in 1939 the square was again renamed \\"Isabel II\\", and the metro station recovered the name \\"√ìpera\\". On 5 June 1968 platforms on the line 5, located at greater depth and 90 m long, were opened to the public. The station was partly renovated between 2003 and 2004. On 23 March 2011 the station reopened after works to improve accessibility. It has a new lobby of 821 m¬≤ (enlarged from 114 m¬≤), and three lifts, one from lobby to the street and two from the lobby to the different platforms. Several escalators were also installed. The entrance to the station was moved from one side of the square to a new position, with two staircases and an elevator built. Museo Arqueol√≥gico Ca√±os del Peral √ìpera station has a museum with a floor space of 234 m¬≤ where 16th- and 17th-century remains may be observed, such as the Ca√±os del Peral Fountain, which delivered water to the Royal Palace via the Amaniel Aqueduct, as well as other water supply works discovered during the remodelling works, such as the Arenal Sewer.

In 1946 it had a population of 1,266 of which 1,211 were Greek Cypriot, 39 Turkish Cypriot and 16 others. The church was built in 1850 and 1851.Exploring Nicosia by Marios Stylianou (publ Selas books 2002) Parish church The church stands on the corner of St. Savvas and Aeschylus streets. It was built in 1850 and 1851 on the foundations of an earlier church, probably Byzantine. It is a two-aisled building with four entrances and a portico built most probably in 1900 when the belfry was built too. The south wall of the church most probably belongs to the previous church. Though the church has no architectural interest, nevertheless it contains some old portable icons as well as some old furniture. Ayios Savvas Church The church is monotholus built. At the west end is a narthex dividing, as is often the case, the west wall of the church from the boundary of the road. Inside the building a few relics from the more ancient church on the site are still preserved. The modern iconostasis is of the usual character, but behind it is preserved the rood from an ancient screen dated 1659. A still more interesting fragment is a gilded panel about 1 m by 50 cm, on which is painted a remarkable portrait of a personage dressed in furred robes, and with a large cap of an Eastern type on his head. This personage is represented in a sitting or kneeling attitude, whilst the gilded background is covered with an inscription in elegant medieval lettering of considerable length. Unfortunately this inscription which seems to be an ascription to St. Savvas is too much defaced to allow of decipherment. The tablet is now clumsily nailed against the side of the iconostasis to fill up a lower panel, and is so little regarded that instead of occupying its original position, it is now placed on its side. This panel is an excellent example of the very rare, ex- voto intended to occupy a place alongside of the usual pictures of the saints on the iconostasis. It is painted on a gold leaf background in precisely the same way and apparently in egg-tempera. Another example of the same kind is the portrait of Maria di Molino at Ay. Chrysostomos Monastery (Kyrenia District). Other examples of the 16th century ex-voto with portraiture of donors may be seen on the iconostasis of Chrysaliniotissa church, Nicosia, but this one of St. Savvas is remarkable for the absence of any saintly figure on the panel. A chalice dated 1516 is said to have formerly been preserved in this church. In the centre of the church is a large gravestone without any trace of effigy or inscription, and strangely placed lengthwise north and south instead of in the more customary manner east and west.A description of the historic monuments of Cyprus.

Criticism The site has been met with criticism, most notably in 2009 from Harriet Harman. Harman, who was the UK government's Minister for Women and Equality at the time, asked then- California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to ban the website, given that it was based in California, US. The web owners thanked Harman for increasing web traffic to their site. In 2013, Trishna Datta, a former outreach worker from Ilford, Essex, launched a petition to have the Punternet website taken down. She said the website lacked adequate safety measures to ensure details that could put sex workers in danger were not revealed. Additionally, she expressed concern that some of the sex workers reviewed on the site might be underage or victims of trafficking or sexual assault. Punternet commented that it would report underage prostitutes to the authorities, and that it encourages customers to report underage prostitutes and victims of trafficking to Crimestoppers UK.

He was widely recognized by his journalistic colleagues and others as an expert on Latin American affairs and as an authoritative and witty commentator upon them. El Pa√≠s correspondent Juan Jes√∫s Azn√°rez described Ibarz as \\"the journalist who knows the most about Latin America.\\" Also described as \\"a defender of democracy and a staunch critic of the populist and authoritarian regimes in Latin America,\\" Ibarz was present at the 1992 Fujimori coup in Peru, the 1994 Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, and other major events in modern Latin American history. In 1991, owing to his coverage of the regime of Fidel Castro, he became the first Spaniard to be expelled from Cuba. He later recalled that after the fall of the Soviet Union, Cubans \\"were so desperate that they were eating the island's cats,\\" and said that no story he had ever written had \\"raised such a ruckus\\" as the 1992 article in which he \\"confirmed the sad fate of Cuban cats\\" by asking 300 or so Cubans if they had eaten cat. \\"About a third said yes.\\" In addition to being expelled from Cuba, he was accused by Hugo Ch√°vez of being \\"responsible for the political agitations against the Bolivarian caudillo.\\" Early life and education Ibarz was born 25 May 1943 in Zaid√≠n (Said√≠), Huesca, Spain. He received a journalism degree from the University of Navarra. Career Ibarz began his career with the daily El Noticiero. In 1970 he started working in Barcelona for the newspaper Tele Expres, for which he covered the conflict in the Sahara. He later worked as executive director of the magazine Ser Padres (\\"Being Parents\\") and as assistant director of the weekly Primera Plana (\\"Close-up\\"). He also worked for the sports publication Barca in 1971, for the Zaragoza weekly Andal√°n in 1977-78, and for the Valles Expres. He moved to Mexico City in 1982 to serve as La Vanguardia's correspondent there, a position he held until his death. In recent years he had also maintained a blog, \\"Diario de Am√©rica Latina\\", on La Vanguardia's website. In announcing that he had been awarded a 2010 Maria Moors Cabot prize, the School of Journalism at Columbia University praised the blog's \\"keen analysis, in-depth reporting and tough and witty prose,\\" saying that it had \\"become a must-read for journalists and opinion makers in the region.\\" For all his prolificity, Ibarz never wrote a book. \\"Friends have told me for years that I should write a book about my experiences,\\" he said near the end of his life. \\"But I was always so busy that I never did, although I had the title down: There's no fixing this.\\" Still, he added that \\"Lula's successful government in Brazil, Chile's institutional strength, Santos' victory in Colombia, and Funes' prudence in El Salvador, augur better days for the region.\\" Views and opinions Ibarz's wry perspective on Latin America was reflected in some of his comments on receiving the Maria Moors Cabot Prize: \\"I've been running around this part of the world for 28 years and I can't complain. I've never lacked for news. I remember a day in 1992 after a group of Spanish correspondents and I had witnessed the last of El Salvador's guerrillas destroy their weapons. We talked about the end of Salvadoran Civil War the guerrilla war in the bloodiest region of the Americas. With the end of the conflict, my colleagues were uncertain about their future. I told them: 'God is generous. He will provide us with good new material for our stories.' God apparently was listening. Hours later, we were waken up with news of an unprecedented coup attempt in Venezuela. The day that the civil wars in the Americas ended, Hugo Ch√°vez didn't allow even five hours of peace and quiet to the continent.\\" Personal life and professional reputation Ibarz, who never married, was known to colleagues and friends as \\"Quim.\\" He was a light sleeper, needing only four or five hours a night. A month before his death he was described by the historian Enrique Krauze as \\"the best witness of contemporary life in Mexico during the past three decades.\\" El Pa√≠s correspondent Juan Jes√∫s Azn√°rez said \\"I will never forget his loyalty to his friends, his unwavering attachment to journalism, and an eagerness and curiosity that did not dwindle one iota until his last day.\\" His colleague Llu√≠s Foix called him \\"one of the greats of international journalism...the correspondent who has known for the longest time, and known best, the changing political scene of Latin America over forty years.\\" Fifteen of Ibarz's colleagues signed their names to a memoir for the Spanish newspaper ABC which read, in part, \\"He had friends in every city, and that's saying something. He loved his friends, and loved to have them near him, always.\\" On his death La Vanguardia published a set of brief tributes by \\"his enormous family of friends.\\" Carmen de Carlos of ABC said \\"Quim was a book you could read to learn and know about Latin America.\\" Javier Sandomingo, Spanish ambassador to Peru, said that \\"Joaqu√≠n...always gave me the benefit of his encyclopedic knowledge of the region\\" and praised his \\"commitment to the fight\\" against the abettors of tyranny in politics and the press. Jos√© de C√≥rdoba of The Wall Street Journal said Ibarz was \\"a model\\" who \\"lived for journalism,\\" was \\"without fear,\\" and loved life. Manuel M. Cascante of ABC praised his collegial generosity and called him \\"the master.\\" Jos√© Vales of El Universal called him \\"the best colleague of my long career and...a brother.\\" Juan Restrepo, formerly of TVE, said he possessed \\"a professional dedication I have rarely encountered in this job.\\" Pablo Biffi, an editor at the Buenos Aires newspaper Clar√≠n, described Ibarz as \\"a 'journalistic animal,' with an admirable and unmatched capacity for work.\\" Mexican diplomat David N√°jera called him a \\"gentlemanly witness to history.\\" Journalist Roger Bartra, in a memoir of Ibarz, noted that \\"Joaquim began his work in Mexico\\" at a time when \\"a process of democratic transition\\" was underway in much of Latin America and that Ibarz \\"asked me insistently\\" why such a transition wasn't beginning in Mexico. \\"The answer could be found in his brilliant journalism.\\" Journalist Fran Sevilla, in a posthumous tribute addressed to Ibarz, said: \\"From your beloved Mexico to your adored Lima, from Quito to Managua, from turbulent Caracas to violent Bogot√° or San Salvador or Guatemala, from the arrested Asunci√≥n to the devastated Port au Pr√≠nce, in the rubble of the Hotel Villa Creole, you were always there, writing history, living it, narrating it in your indispensable chronicles in La Vanguardia.\\" A Peruvian colleague wrote: \\"We Latin Americans have been greatly fortunate that Joaqu√≠n Ibarz Melet...arrived in Mexico one day in 1982 as the correspondent of La Vanguardia.\\" A Columbia University student wrote after Ibarz's death that his \\"passion and love for the region (not to mention his sense of humor) was palpable\\" to the students who met him when he came to Columbia to receive his Cabot prize. Honors and awards In 1993 Ibarz was presented with the International Press Center Prize, awarded in Madrid for the best work by Spanish journalists based abroad. In 2009 he won the Cirilo Rodr√≠guez Journalism Award. And in 2010 he became the first European to receive the Maria Moors Cabot prize from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, which is awarded for journalism about the Americas. In announcing the award, Columbia University said that Ibarz had produced \\"some of the best- informed and clear-eyed writing of anyone in the hemisphere\\" and that he \\"still approaches his job with the contagious enthusiasm of a cub reporter.\\" The Columbia University statement noted further that while covering the Haitian earthquake, Ibarz had \\"darted through Port-au-Prince's rubble-filled streets on the back of a motorcycle. Covering a referendum a few years ago in Venezuela, Ibarz roamed the streets of Caracas for hours seeking a lead. He finally found it when he stumbled on a slowly deflating, two-story balloon in the shape of Hugo Ch√°vez in front of the presidential palace....Ibarz has always been the first to ask uncomfortable questions and demand difficult answers of those in power, regardless of political fashion or persuasion.\\" The prize statement concluded that \\"Like few others, Ibarz lives for journalism. His generosity, professionalism, and hard work set an example today for his colleagues.\\" The Cabot ceremony occurred while Ibarz's cancer was in remission and a Columbia University student who met him at the time described him as making \\"a valiant effort to travel to New York for the Cabot gala.\\" Death Ibarz died of a brain tumor after a six-month illness. He was diagnosed with his brain tumor in Mexico City the summer before his death. Two months before his death he returned from Mexico City to Spain, where he moved back to his family home in Zaid√≠n and received medical treatment in Barcelona. After his death, the president of Mexico, Felipe Calder√≥n, called it \\"a sad day for Hispanic journalism.\\" Ibarz was survived by a number of family members, of whom La Vanguardia singled out his niece Merc√® as the chief mourner. In April 2011, Ibarz received a posthumous tribute in the form of a ceremony held at the Cultural Center of Spain in Mexico City. It was attended by many of his colleagues who gave speeches recalling their experiences with Ibarz over the years.

He mentioned the museum at the end of his Cabot Prize speech, referring to it as \\"my personal Iberoamerican project. In my almost three decades knocking about Latin America, I've let myself be seduced by the richness of the continent's popular art. I have visited astonishing markets in all of our countries.

It's probable that my collection has more huipiles ‚Äì embroidered cotton dresses ‚Äì than Nobel Prize winner Rigoberta Mench√∫ closet.\\" The museum, he said, was \\"my way of thanking a continent that has taught me so much and where I have had so many happy times.\\" References 1943 births 2011 deaths People from the Province of Huesca Spanish journalists University of Navarra alumni ","title":"Joaquim Ibarz"},{"id":"41194156","text":"Touba and the Meaning of Night () is a novel written by the Iranian novelist, Shahrnush Parsipur and originally published in Iran in 1989.

It is displayed today in the Aachen Cathedral Treasury.  Description  The ancient myth of the Rape of Persephone is depicted in high relief on the sarcophagus. Persephone is carried away to the underworld by Pluto, the god of the underworld, with the help of Athena and Eros, on a quadriga led by the divine messenger Hermes. The hellhound Cerberus is found at Hermes' feet near the death god Tartarus. The giant Enceladus rises out of the Earth, to receive the chariot. The nymph Cyane lies at the bottom under the chariot. On a chariot steered by a winged divinity and drawn by dragons, Demeter, Persephone's mother, follows the baggage with torches in her hands. Meanwhile, Aphrodite flies, an accomplice to the kidnapping. Below her, two handmaidens of Persephone frightened have fallen to the Earth and try to protect their baskets full of flowers. On the left narrow side in flat relief, two handmaidens of Persephone and a boy are picking flowers. The right narrow side shows a child, who is accompanied by two shepherds and carries fruit in the cornucopia of a Genius.  Origin  The sarcophagus was made in the first quarter of the 3rd century AD in a workshop in the city of Rome, from carrara marble. There are many more Roman sarcophagi with depictions of the Rape of Persephone.  Charlemagne  Whether Charlemagne was buried in the Persephone Sarcophagus in 814 is disputed among historians. The sources on the death and burial of Charlemagne do not expressly mention it. Nevertheless, it has been assumed that this sarcophagus could have been found among \\"the columns and the marble\\" that Charlemagne had brought from Rome and Ravenna for the building for his Palatine chapel, according to Einhard's Vita Karoli Magni (ch.26). In that case, he would have been buried in the sarcophagus in the manner of a Western Roman Emperor. On the other hand, the historian Dieter H√§germann suspected that the Persephone Sarcophagus was first used to store the bones of Charlemagne in 1165 after the exhumation of Charlemagne's grave by Frederick Barbarossa. H√§germann argued this on the grounds that the sources on Charlemagne's funeral in 814 say nothing of the sarcophagus, but instead speak of the interment of Charlemagne in the floor of the Palatine chapel. H√§germann considered it unlikely that anyone would have just buried such a finely carved marble sarcophagus in the floor of the church.Dieter H√§germann: Karl der Gro√üe, Herrscher des Abendlandes. Propyl√§en, M√ºnchen 2000, S. 628ff. The reason why someone would have selected a sarcophagus with \\"heathen\\" motifs for the burial of a Christian emperor could lie in a Christian interpretation of the Persephone story: the fact that later in the myth Ceres succeeds in bringing Persephone up by her request that her daughter be allowed to return to the Earth for two thirds of the year was perhaps interpreted as a metaphor for the resurrection of Jesus. By 1215 at the latest, the bones of Charlemagne must have been taken from the sarcophagus, since in this year they are attested in the Karlsschrein. From this time, the empty sarcophagus stood in the lower chamber of the octagon of Aachen Cathedral ‚Äì only the front side visible through a grill ‚Äì presumably with the wooden figure of Charlemagne from the 14th century which is now exhibited in the Treasury and was probably part of a so-called Karlsmemorie (Charlemagne Memorial). In 1794, Napoleon Bonaparte had the sarcophagus brought to Paris together with the ancient columns of the cathedral, but in 1815 it returned to Aachen again and was installed in the Nikolauskapelle. From 1843 it was in the Michael gallery of the Nikolauskapelle, which was not accessible to the public. In the attempt to hoist the sarcophagus up to the gallery, it took heavy damage. Since 1979 it has been on display in the Cathedral Schatzkammer.  Notes   Bibliography  * Herta Lepie, Georg Minkenberg: Die Schatzkammer des Aachener Domes.
