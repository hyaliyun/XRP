Biography Astry lived at the Great House, Henbury, Gloucestershire, with her parents, Sir Samuel and Lady Elizabeth Astry, and her siblings, Elizabeth, Ann, Arabella, Luke and St John. Her father died in 1704, and in 1707, when their widowed mother married Sir Simon Harcourt, Diana Astry and her sister Arabella moved to Pendley, Hertfordshire. In 1708, Astry married Richard Orlebar. She was an heiress with a fortune of ¬£7000 who inherited even more money when her mother died 20 days after the wedding. The couple moved back to Henbury until the completion of their home, Hinwick House at Podington in Bedfordshire, in 1714. Diana Orlebar died childless two years later. Richard Orlebar, who was High Sheriff for Bedfordshire in 1720, was buried beside his wife in St Mary the Virgin, Podington when he died in 1733. Recipe book and notebook Most of the 375 recipes Astry collected, before and just after her marriage, are of a practical nature, including general culinary, pickling, preserving, and medicinal entries. The sources of the recipes and tips are acknowledged and reflect not only the lifestyle of the upper middle classes in England and housekeeping knowledge required to run a country house, but also Astry's wide circle of influential friends and acquaintances. The book includes recipes for 239 food dishes, 52 wines or cordials, 21 medicinal remedies, 25 pickles and 38 preserves. Among the sources mentioned are: Lady Drake, Lady Churchill, Lady Holt, Lady Torrington (whose recipe for \\"orange water\\" included \\"2 leaves of gold\\"), Lady Terret, Lady Chick(h)eley and Lady Fane. Where only initials have been recorded, the source may be a housekeeper; like the Orlebars‚Äô Hannah French. Three men have contributed recipes: Mr Clark ‚Äì \\"To make red strake sider\\"; Captain Rider ‚Äì \\"An orange pudding\\"; and Dr Culpeper ‚Äì \\"Dr Stephens' water (for use in childbirth)\\". Culpeper's recipe was one of many for \\"Dr Stephens' water\\" circulating in seventeenth-century texts. Astry's vellum- bound recipe book is mostly written in her hand, although the writing deteriorates towards the end and a few recipes are written by another. The recipes are not in any particular order though there are more medicinal recipes towards the end, including for the plague and dog bite. The cordial with more than 80 herbs and spices \\"will cost 50 shillings a quart to make it\\". \\"Her recipes are vague as to quantity...and timing...and rich in content. A good soup is made with a leg of beef, veal, mutton, a cock, lean bacon, a pigeon, cheese, ginger, mace, cloves, onions, carrot, turnip, horseradish, anchovies and sweet herbs\\".History of Bedfordshire 1066-1888, Bedfordshire County Council, 1969, Joyce Godber A venison pasty takes a side of venison, 14lb of flour, 6lb butter, 10 eggs + 6 whites. There are recipes for freshwater fish: carp, pike, eels, lamprey and tench. Sugar of various grades e.g. brown sugar candy, white sugar candy, brasile sugar, refined sugar, double refined sugar, is used for sweetening. Honey is mentioned in only three recipes for mead. There is a recipe for catchope/ catchop/ ceachup (ketchup) utilising white wine vinegar, 6 anchovies (‚Äòunwasht‚Äô), cloves, mace, bay leaf, bunches of rosemary and sweet marjoram, and a little balm, to be coloured with claret. Alebaster (alabaster) was used for fining elder wine. Red hot brass farthings were put in white wine vinegar with salt to make a solution to green any sort of pickle. A powder of earthworms is recommended \\"for the yellow jaunders (jaundice)\\". Astry's vellum notebook/ pocket book, dated 1706, contains a record of meals eaten at various dinner parties and venues (1701‚Äì1708) and a note of her weight as 4 score and 14 lbs (6 stone 10 lbs) on 8 October 1705. In her 2003 book The British Housewife, Gilly Lehmann comments that \\"There is not much evidence of French dishes in this notebook\\" even though \\"Astry's own collection of cookery receipts contained many fricassees and raggoos\\". She considers that at \\"a supper in London in 1706\\" where the dishes were \\"set on the table one at a time, imposing the order of consumption, was worthy of notice. She also notes that this supper started with a sweet posset\\".The British Housewife ‚Äì Cookery books, Cooking and Society in 18th Century Britain Gilly Lehmann, Prospect Books 2003. p354. Personal life Diana and Richard Orlebar did not have any children. In 1709, Simon Harcourt wrote to Richard Orlebar \\"hoping to hear the young ffox hunter thrives apace, & that you‚Äôl soon have occasion to demand my promise of making it a Christian\\" (being godfather). In 1710, after believing she was pregnant, Diana Orlebar wrote to her sister Elizabeth about her longing for a child.The Orlebar Chronicles 15531733 Vol.1 Frederica St John Orlebar, 1930, London: Mitchell Hughes and Clarke (Facing p193, there are portraits of Diana Astry and Richard Orlebar) Of Diana Astry's three sisters, Elizabeth (died 1715) married Sir John Smyth (Smith) of Long Ashton, Anne (died 1703 in childbirth) married Thomas Chester IV of Knole, and Arabella (died 1722) married Charles William Howard, 7th Earl of Suffolk.

Reitzenhain seen from Hirtstein Reitzenhain, former railway station on the right  Geography  Reitzenhain is located on the crest of the Ore Mountains, next to the border between Germany and the Czech republic at an altitude of ca. 778 m (station building) on the stream Schwarze Pockau. The abandoned village Pohraniƒçn√≠ (B√∂hmisch Reizenhain) is situated to its south-east, on the Czech side of the border and on the right bank of the stream.  Etymology  The name of the village is supposedly derived from a wayside inn (locally called a Han) on the nearby mountain pass, which happened to be the thirteenth inn ('Dreizehnter Han') on the road from Leipzig to Prague, counted from either end.Karl-Heinz Melzer: Wolkenstein‚ÄìJ√∂hstadt‚ÄìPre√ünitztal. VEB Tourist Verlag, Berlin/ Leipzig, 1979, S. 61. This is also reflected by the number \\"13\\" (German: 'Dreizehn') in the village's coat of arms.  History  Reitzenhain was first mentioned in a document of 1401 as Reiczenstein, being a village on the border to Bohemia. In 1551 it belonged to Gro√ür√ºckerswalde parish, in 1607 it was transferred to K√ºhnhaide parish. Reitzenhain children also attended school in K√ºhnhaide. Due to the strategically important location on the Reitzenhain pass, the village was frequently occupied by military forces, in particular in the Thirty Years' War and in the Seven Years' War. Until 1856 Reitzenhain belonged administratively to Amt Wolkenstein.Historisches Ortsverzeichnis Sachsen The road between Marienberg and Reitzenhain was improved to rural highway standards in the first half of the 19th century. The railway from Chemnitz to Komotau via Marienberg was opened on 23 August 1875. The volunteer fire department was founded in 1879. A schoolhouse was opened in 1882. Peat digging started in 1891. Together with the neighbouring Reizenhain on the Czech side of the border, the Reitzenhain neighbourhood of Rei√üigm√ºhle was connected to the electricity supply network in 1921. New municipal offices were inaugurated in 1924. K√ºhnhaide was administratively joined with Reitzenhain on 1 October 1937, but became a separate municipality again on 1 April 1948. A bomb dropped on the village in February 1945 destroyed one building and killed 14 persons. After World War II the economical ties to Bohemia were interrupted, which caused a decline of the village. Reitzenhain remained a separate municipality until 31 December 1993, it then joined with K√ºhnhaide, R√ºbenau, and Satzung to form the new municipality HirtsteinGemeinden 1994 und ihre Ver√§nderungen seit 01.01.1948 in den neuen L√§ndern, Verlag Metzler-Poeschel, Stuttgart, 1995, , Statistisches Bundesamt of which it became the administrative seat.

Reitzenhain station was border station on the Saxon line Fl√∂ha-Reitzenhain which continued via Reizenhain (Pohraniƒçn√≠) to Komotau (Chomutov). When cross-border traffic ceased after World War II, the station lost its importance. Passenger trains to Reitzenhain were cancelled on 1 October 1978, freight trains on 8 January 1994, the line between Marienberg and Reitzenhain was closed on 15 December 1998 and has been lifted in 2013 in favour of a bicycle and hiking path.Freie Presse Online: Bagger r√§umt alte Bahnstrecke zwischen Marienberg und Reitzenhain f√ºr Radfahrer und Wanderer frei ‚Äì R√ºckbauarbeiten auf dem 14 Kilometer langen Gleisabschnitt, retrieved 6 July 2015Niederschrift √ºber die 12.

He was Professor of Materia Medica at Aberdeen University from 1930 to 1959. He won the Military Cross in 1918 due to his bravery serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Life He was born in Patna, East Ayrshire in south-west Scotland on 6 May 1889, the son of Agnes Smith Campbell, a seamstress. His father, Stewart Campbell, was a teacher, but died either before David was born or soon after, leaving the family in difficult financial circumstances. However, David‚Äôs brilliant mind compensated for other factors. He won a scholarship to Ayr Academy and then won a further scholarship to Glasgow University to study Mathematics and Physics. He qualified MA and BSc in 1911. He then decided to continue in studies, and studied Medicine and Pharmacology, still at Glasgow University, qualifying MB ChB in 1916. His medical career was interrupted by the First World War. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1916 and won the Military Cross in 1918 whilst serving in northern France as an Acting Major. He was discharged in 1919. He returned to act as an assistant to Prof Ralph Stockman at Glasgow University and in 1921 became the Pollok Lecturer in Materia Medica and Pharmacology. He also worked at the Glasgow Western Infirmary as a physician from this time until 1929 (with various breaks for studies). He qualified MD in 1924. His final thesis, on rheumatoid arthritis, earned him the coveted Bellahouston Gold Medal. In 1925 he travelled to the United States as a Rockefeller Medical Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. In 1930 he received the chair as Professor of Materia Medica at Aberdeen University and relocated. Here he made huge advances in the Aberdeen centre for medical research at Foresterhill, and was elevated to Dean of Faculty in 1932. In 1949 he was elected President of the General Medical Council for all of UK. He was also Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee covering medical malpractice. In 1950 he received a staggering five honorary doctorates: LLD from Glasgow University, Liverpool University, Dublin University and Aberdeen University; and a DCL from Durham University. In 1951 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was knighted in the 1953 Coronation Honours List. He retired to Peterculter west of Aberdeen in 1961. He continued personal research but also enjoyed both golf and billiards. He died there at home, 252 North Deeside Road on 30 May 1978. Family He married Margaret Lyle in 1921. They had no children.

Pichagh-gheime is usually made with lamb's meat, sliced onions, almond and egg. One of the most important secrets of making this dish is to fry sliced onion in oil, which turns the color of onions from white to brown. Fried eggs are used in order to design it beautifully. White rice is also eaten beside this food. This food is also cooked by cities and villages near Ardebil, such as Tabriz and Sareyn.

His father counted as ruler of a region by the name of keramaytan. Avicenna along with his family after moving to Bukhara, continued his studies. According to Nasr, Avicenna had many teachers including NƒÅtelƒ´ physicians Ab≈´ Man·π£≈´r Qomrƒ´ and Ab≈´ Sahl Masƒ´·∏•ƒ´. Avicenna wrote nearly 250 works on diverse sciences in medieval period including long and short treatises such as the Daneshnameh Alaei (The Book of Science Dedicated to 'Alii' al-Dawlah). Avicenna wrote Isharat when he was under the criticism of certain literary scholars, showing his skill in Arabic language by a philosophy book as Isharat. Nasr refers to the book of Isharat as the last and greatest masterpiece of Avicenna.seyyed hossein Nasr, three Muslim Sages, p.23,1997 Content Isharat described as comprehensive and mature book by Avicenna. This book wholly divided into two parts. The first part is about logic which in turn divided to ten subparts. Second part is about philosophy which is in turn separated into ten subparts. Avicenna himself calls the subparts of logic as Nahj or style and philosophy part as Namat. Inanti divided it to four parts namely logic, physics, metaphysics and Sufism. the titles of Al Isharat is drawn from the titles of the majority of chapters in the whole work.Shams Inati,1996.p.1 Title of book The word of Isharat is a synonym of signs, remarks, indications and hints. Also Tanbihat is synonym with words such as admonitions, warnings and caution. According to Inati, Isharat signifies on Avicenna own views. In other words, when Ibn Sina refers to Isharah, he shows his opinion. When he refers to Tanbihat, he shows the faults of other philosophers in one subject. Sometimes Avicenna refers to Isharah by words like A follow up, a closing comment and wish . also he refers to Tanbiha by a word like delusion.Shams Inati,1996.p.1 Characters Ibn Sina wrote the book such a way that just philosophers understand it. Avicenna himself points out that this book is not suitable for non-philosophers and those who are of sharp-mind has right to dealth with the book.Shams Inati,1996.p.2 Commentaries Many commentaries have been written about this book and most famous ones are Nasir al-Din al-Tusi Tusi (Sharh al-isharat) and Imam Fakhr Razi and an explanation and description of Allame Hassan Hasanzadeh Amoli.

Fields, Commanding General of 1st Marine Division. Background On 30 July 1966 the 5th Marine Regiment was instructed to begin planning a search and destroy operation in the Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c and Song Ly Ly vallies with the ARVN 2nd Division to locate and engage the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 2nd Division. The operation plan called for the ARVN 2nd and 4th Battalions supported by the 2nd and 3rd APC Troops of the 4th Armored Cavalry to advance southwest from ThƒÉng B√¨nh towards Qu·∫ø S∆°n where 3 Vietnamese Marine Battalions would form blocking positions. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines would be landed by helicopters southwest of Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c and they would move eastwards towards the ARVN, with the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines reinforcing if required. Operation 6 August On the morning of 6 August after preparatory air and artillery strikes, helicopters from MAG-16 and MAG-36 began ferrying the Vietnamese and U.S. Marines to their landing zones. The Vietnamese Marines were heavily engaged on landing, killing 50 and capturing 20 PAVN from the 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment before breaking contact at nightfall. 7 August On the morning of 7 August the Vietnamese Marines moved north towards the hamlet of Thach Thu'ong (3) which the PAVN were believed to have fortified. The attack was delayed due to heavy rains and poor visibility prevented airstrikes until the afternoon. The Vietnamese made a frontal attack on the hamlet but were driven back twice before withdrawing to allow artillery and airstrikes to hit the PAVN positions. 8 August On the morning of the 8th the Vietnamese Marines secured Thach Thu'ong (3) with no opposition as the PAVN had retreated during the night. 37 PAVN bodies were located in the village. Also that day after 2 days without enemy contact the 2/5 Marines returned to Tam K·ª≥. 10 August At 08:30 as the 1/5 Marines which had been deployed in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley with no enemy contact was preparing to move from ƒê·∫°i ƒê·ªìng east towards Route 1 it began to receive harassment fire. By 15:00 as the Marine column approached the hamlet of Cam Khe in a heavy rainstorm approximately 30 PAVN were seen running across a paddyfield and were engaged by the Marines. Soon the entire Regiment was fighting the PAVN at close quarters, unable to call in supporting arms because of the poor visibility. At 17:30 the rains lifted and UH-1 gunships from VMO-6 and A-4s from MAG-12 began hitting the PAVN positions. By nightfall the PAVN had disengaged with the loss of over 100 dead, while the Marines had lost 14 dead and 65 wounded. 13 August At 10:30 two PAVN Battalions engaged the Vietnamese Marine/ARVN Cavalry force near Vinh Huy in an all-day battle before disengaging at nightfall. South Vietnamese losses were 26 dead and 54 wounded while over 140 PAVN bodies were left behind. Aftermath Operation Lien Ket concluded on 14 August with the Vietnamese Marines/ARVN returning to ThƒÉng B√¨nh. Operation Colorado concluded on 22 August the Marines had suffered 99 dead and 212 wounded and the PAVN 283 killed.

At the time, there was no treatment available for quadriplegia, and he spent the following two years bedbound in different hospitals.

This eventually led him to establish K√ºschall AG. K√ºschall began serial production of wheelchairs in 1976 ‚Äì first in his living room, later in a factory. After a severe infection which caused a coma, K√ºschall sold his company to Invacare, a major medical equipment manufacturer based in the USA, in 1996.

By reducing the weight and adding new adjustment possibilities for seated positions, K√ºschall increased the range of uses and the mobility of the wheelchair and established the now common monotube design. The product, which he called the Competition (known as Champion 3000 in the USA), was revolutionary at the time and is still one of the most copied basic designs for wheelchairs today. In 1986, K√ºschall received the award of the Museum of Modern Art.MoMA ‚Äì The Collection ‚Äì Rainer K√ºschall. Champion 3000 Adjustable Rigid-Frame Wheelchair. 1986 The Competition wheelchair was the first medical device added to the collection at the MoMA and is still exhibited there.

From 1982 onwards, he devoted himself to wheelchair racing and broke the world record for almost every distance on several occasions. By the end of his paralympic sporting career in 1992, K√ºschall had won 21 paralympic medals and was five times world champion.Exotische Fahrzeuge (German, PDF, 446 KB) In 2002, K√ºschall bought an AC Cobra 427 which he has been driving ever since as the first Swiss quadriplegic with an international motor racing license.

Its straddle-beam design is based on the ALWEG monorail, which was first developed in the 1950s and later popularized by Disney at their theme parks. Innovia Monorail 300 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. History Jacksonville Skyway Las Vegas Monorail Walt Disney World Monorail In 1989, Walt Disney World got a new fleet of Mark VI monorail trains built by Bombardier Transportation. Bombardier later supplied its first turnkey monorail system in 1991 to Tampa International Airport in Florida; followed by a contract for JTA Skyway Monorail system in Jacksonville, Florida in 1994. Shortly after, in 1996, Newark Liberty International Airport opened a Von Roll monorail system to connect all its terminals. Von Roll technology was sold to Adtranz and later acquired by Bombardier. These early systems are now grouped under the name Innovia Monorail 100. In July 2004, Las Vegas opened its 6-mile long Mark IV Las Vegas Monorail monorail system (technology now known Innovia Monorail 200 system). The system suffered from repeated technical difficulties, including parts falling from a moving vehicle, in the first few months of service. The system was temporarily closed for 4 months and reopened in December 2004. Since then, the monorail carries 30,000 passengers daily, despite this it is still not meeting the original ridership estimates. In 2010, the cities of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and S√£o Paulo, Brazil placed orders from Bombardier for its latest Innovia Monorail 300 system. As of 2015, both systems are still in delivery. The Riyadh system is for the new King Abdullah Financial District, which will be a car-free economic hub in the Middle East. The S√£o Paulo system will be part of the city's mass transit network and serve 17 stations between the residential districts of Vila Prudente and Cidade Tiradentes. The line started its operations in August 2014 and currently includes ten stations. In November 2014, Bombardier signed a joint venture (JV) agreement with CSR Puzhen in China to develop and manufacture Innovia Monorail vehicles (as well as Innovia APM vehicles) for the Chinese market. In August 2019, a consortium including Bombardier signed an agreement with the National Authority for Tunnels in Cairo, Egypt which included the development and build of 70 4-car monorail trains for $2.85 billion for two new lines, between East Cairo and the New Administrative Capital, and between Giza and 6th October City. Technical Characteristics Innovia Monorails systems have several defining features: * Low profile vehicles/low floor height above beam * Distinct sloped nose/end-cap * Inter-car walkthrough (characteristic of 300 series only) * Rubber-tires and permanent magnet motor * Aluminium carbody, steel underframe, composite end cap * \\"Warp lights\\" in the vehicle shirt Driverless Operation Innovia Monorails are all fully automated and use a variety of train control technologies. However, the Riyadh and S√£o Paulo monorails are both equipped with CITYFLO 650 communications-based train control. Driverless operation offers many advantages including improved safety, high reliability, shorter headways between trains and lower maintenance costs. Emergency walkway on Las Vegas Monorail system Guidebeams These monorails operate on a narrow, elevated guidebeam. Pre- cast, post-tensioned guidebeams are constructed at an off-site location and later installed on the system. The guidebeams are 690 mm (27 in) wide. The Innovia Monorail 300 was designed to navigate curves as tight as 46 m and a maximum grade of 6%. Monorail switches are either beam replacement or multi- position pivot switches. Safety Innovia Monorail systems have evacuation walkways down the entire length of the guidebeam. These walkways allow passengers to escape any onboard hazard. The maintenance crew also uses these walkways for repairs and general maintenance to the system. Production The three generations of Innovia Monorails have been assembled in different plants. Today, there are multiple production facilities which have produced the trains including Kingston, Canada; Wuhu, China; Hortol√¢ndia, Brazil and Derby, United Kingdom.

In 2014, the Innovia Monorail 300 was a winner of the Good Design Award in the Transportation 2014 category. Accidents and incidents The only city in the world to have an Innovia 300 monorail in operation, S√£o Paulo has had its system break-down on multiple occasions, due to problems in implementation and on the train project itself, ever since it started operating commercially. In 2016, a train departed from the Orat√≥rio (S√£o Paulo Metro) station with its doors open, which luckily caused no accidents, due to an error in the programming made by Bombardier on the train's computers. It's worth noting that those trains operate on unprotected 15-meter (45-feet) high tracks. In January 2019, two trains collided on the to-be-opened Jardim Planalto (S√£o Paulo Metro) station, causing both to become unusable for the remainder of the year. According to the metro workers' union, this accident was caused because there's a gap in the system: if one train is shut down, it disappears from the control system and is not seen by others, which could (and supposedly did) cause crashes. In January 2020, due to poor constructing, screws fell from one of the line's track-switches, causing the line to operate precariously for five days. The section in which this took place (in the vicinity of the S√£o Lucas (S√£o Paulo Metro) station) had been opened only two years prior. In February 2020, the worst accident so far happened: a tire from the train M20 exploded, causing the system to completely shut down while Bombardier technicians looked into what happened, partially reopening ninety-four days later (on June 1st) and fully reopening 111 days after the incident, on June 18th. According to a preliminary report by the S√£o Paulo State's Research Institute, what caused the incident were hundreds of imperfections on the concrete rails, which caused strong vibrations that, in turn, made the tire's runflat mechanism touch the rubber from inside the wheel, causing premature wear and consequent rupture. After investigating, it was found out that all 23 operational trains from the line's fleet had been affected by this issue.

Born in Clara, County Kilkenny, Prendergast was introduced to hurling by his father, Paddy Prendergast, a three-time All- Ireland medal winner. He enjoyed All-Ireland success at colleges level with St. Kieran's College while simultaneously joining the Clara senior club team. An All-Ireland medal winner in the intermediate grade with Clara, Prendergast has also won two championship medals at senior level. Prendergast made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. An All-Ireland runner-up in this grade, he later won an All-Ireland medal with the intermediate team. Prendergast made his senior debut during the 2014 league. He has since gone on to play a key role for Kilkenny in defence, and has won one All-Ireland medal and one Leinster medal. Playing career Club Prendergast enjoyed his first success with the Clara intermediate hurling team in 2007. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of St. Lachtain's in the championship decider gave him his first winners' medal in that competition. Five years later in 2012, Prendergast added a second intermediate championship medal to his collection following a 1‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì4 defeat of St. Patrick's Ballyragget. Clara subsequently faced Oylegate/Glenbrien in the provincial decider. An incredible game followed, which saw Oylgate having four men dismissed for second-yellow card offences. Clara powered to a 3‚Äì20 to 0‚Äì5 victory, with Prendergast collecting a Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Clare face London-based St. Gabriel's. Clara were convincing 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì11 winners, with Prendergast picking up an All-Ireland Intermediate Club Hurling Championship medal. A year after making the step up to the top flight, Clara faced hot favourites Carrickshock in the senior championship decider in 2013. With four minutes of normal time left, Carrickshock looked the likely winners as they went two points ahead. Lester Ryan scored 1-1 in the final moments to secure a 1-15 to 2-10 victory. It was Prendergast's first championship medal in the senior grade. Inter-county Prendergast first came to prominence on the inter- county scene as a member of the Kilkenny minor team in 2004. He won a Leinster medal that year following a heavy 1‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì4 defeat of Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland decider on 12 September 2004 pitted Kilkenny against Galway. Richie Hogan proved to be the hero for Kilkenny, as his point, a minute into injury time, earned \\"the Cats\\" a 1‚Äì18 to 3‚Äì12 draw. The replay a week later on 19 September 2004 was also a close affair, with Galway just about holding off the Kilkenny challenge to win by 0‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12. By 2008 Prendergast had joined the Kilkenny intermediate team. He won a Leinster medal that year following a 4-26 to 3-15 extra-time defeat of Dublin. On 30 August 2008 Kilkenny faced Limerick in the All-Ireland decider. A 1-16 to 0-13 victory gave Prendergast an All-Ireland Intermediate Hurling Championship medal. Prendergast was added to the Kilkenny senior team in 2014, however, he failed to make the championship panel. On 21 June 2015 Prendergast made his championship debut when he came on as a substitute for Jackie Tyrrell in a 5-25 to 0-16 Leinster semi-final defeat of Wexford. He later won a Leinster medal when he came on as a substitute once again in a 1-25 to 2-15 defeat of Galway. Kilkenny renewed their rivalry with Galway once again in the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 2015. The team struggled in the first half, however, a T. J. Reid goal and a dominant second half display, which limited Galway to just 1-4, saw Kilkenny power to a 1-22 to 1-18 victory. It was Prendergast's first All-Ireland medal.

The building blocks of thetical grammar are theticalsKaltenb√∂ck defines it as 'the non locative meaning' of a discourse element such as between you and me. KNK2011 p. 2, that is, linguistic expressions which are interpolated in, or juxtaposed to, clauses or sentences but syntactically, semantically and, typically, prosodically independent from theses structures. The two domains are associated with contrasting principles of designing texts: Whereas sentence grammar is essentially restricted to the structure of sentences in a propositional format, thetical grammar concerns the overall contours of discourse beyond the sentence, thereby being responsible for a higher level of discourse production. An example The following example, taken from the Comprehensive Grammar of English, illustrates the main characteristics of thetical grammar. *a. They considered Miss Hartley a very good teacher. *b. They considered Miss Hartley, a very good teacher. The phrase a very good teacher is a complement of the sentence in (a.), that is, it is part of the syntax of the sentence; in the framework of discourse grammar, it is therefore classified as belonging to sentence grammar. In (b.), by contrast, the same phrase (but printed in italics) is not part of the syntax; it is syntactically independent from the rest of the sentence, commonly classified as a non-restrictive appositive. And it is also different in other ways: Whereas in (a.) it is part of the prosody of the sentence, in (b) it is separated from the preceding clause by a tone unit boundary in spoken English and by a comma in written English. And third, there is also a difference in meaning: Whereas the meaning of a very good teacher in (a.) is determined by its syntactic function as a complement of the sentence, it is fairly independent from the sentence meaning in (b.); the former meaning has therefore been called restrictive and the latter non-restrictive. The phrase a very good teacher in (b) is classified as belonging to thetical grammar, that is, as a thetical. Theticals are defined in the following way: They are syntactically unattached, they are typically set off prosodically from the rest of the utterance, their meaning is non-restrictive, they tend to be positionally mobile, and their internal structure is built on principles of sentence grammar but can be elliptic. Principles and concepts Sentence grammar is organized in terms of propositional concepts and clauses and their combination. Thetical grammar, by contrast, concerns the linguistic discourse beyond the sentence, its functions relate to the situation of discourse, most of all to the organization of texts, speaker-hearer interaction, and attitudes of the speaker. The domain of thetical grammar includes but is not restricted to what in other works is referred to variously as parentheticals, syntactic non-clausal units, extra-clausal constituents, disjuncts, or supplements. Paradigm examples of theticals are formulae of social exchange (Good morning!, please), vocatives (Waiter!), interjections (ouch!, wow!), and discourse markers (if you will, you know, now, well), but theticals also include a virtually unlimited pool of other expressions that are produced spontaneously, like a very good teacher in the example of (b) above. While being separate in principle, thetical grammar interacts in multiple ways with sentence grammar in shaping linguistic discourse. The main way of interaction is via cooptation, an operation whereby chunks of sentence grammar such as clauses, phrases, words, or any other units are deployed for use in thetical grammar.

He also served in several episcopal posts and served as the Bishop of Przemy≈õl.J√≥zef Sebastian Pelczar (1842-1924) Pope John Paul II - on his fourth visit to Poland - beatified Pelczar in 1991 and presided over the canonization in 2003. Life J√≥zef Sebastian Pelczar was born in Poland in 1842 to Adalbert and Marianna Miƒôsowicz. As a child he felt a strong calling to serve God and so once wrote in his journal: \\"Earthly ideals are fading away. I see the ideal of life in sacrifice, and the ideal of sacrifice in priesthood\\". Pelczar studied in Rzeszow and then commenced his studies for the priesthood in Przemy≈õl in 1860. At the age of 16 he became a member of the Saint Vincent de Paul Society and of the organization known as Popular Education. After the completion of his studies, he was ordained as a priest on 17 July 1864. He was assigned to be a parish priest at Sambor. He was later transferred to Rome in 1866 for further studies and he studied at the Institute of Saint Apollinaris and at the Collegium Romanum. He gained a doctorate in both theological studies and in canon law. He also served as a professor from 1869 to 1877 and served in that role in both Przemy≈õl and Krakow from 1882 to 1883. Pelczar established several libraries and he delivered free lectures and published countless books. He would write on historical topics as well as on canon law. He started a school for those who were servants. He founded the Fraternity of Our Lady, Queen of the Polish Crown in 1891 with the objective of caring for the poor and for orphans as well as for the sick and those who had no job. While in Krakow in 1893 he met Ludwika Szczƒôsna and the two established the Sister Servants of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus on 15 April 1894 with the aim of working with women. Pope Leo XIII appointed Pelczar as the Bishop of Przemy≈õl on 17 December 1900 and he was installed in 1901. He made frequent visits to all parishes within the diocese and supported all religious orders. He also conducted three episcopal meetings to discuss diocesan issues and worked to reform seminaries to promote better education and greater access to resources for them. In addition to this, he also built and restored churches, established nurseries, kitchens, homeless shelters and schools. He ensured that the implementation of the social doctrine described in the writings of Leo XIII ‚Äî such as the papal encyclical Rerum Novarum - was a top priority. Pelczar also served as one of the co-consecrators at the consecration of Achille Ratti ‚Äî the future Pope Pius XI on 28 October 1919. Pelczar died on 28 March 1924 with a strong reputation for holiness and was hailed as a shepherd who paid close attention to pastoral issues. It is said that he died in the odour of sanctity. Canonization Tomb of St. J√≥zef Sebastian Pelczar. The sainthood process was introduced on a formal level on 25 January 1983 despite the fact that the local process had opened and the positio had been submitted for evaluation. The local process had spanned from 26 March 1954 until 1957 which granted Pelczar16 the posthumous title of Servant of God. The positio ‚Äî documentation and a biography ‚Äî was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1982. Pope John Paul II approved that Pelczar had lived a life of heroic virtue and declared him to be Venerable on 18 February 1989. The miracle that was required for Pelczar's beatification was investigated and was ratified on 23 June 1989. John Paul II approved the miracle on 10 July 1990 and beatified him on his visit to Poland on 2 June 1991. The pope also approved the second miracle required for canonization and presided over the canonization on 18 May 2003.

It lost two seat in the 1955 elections, but won four seats in 1958. Constitutional changes in 1960 created the post of Chief Minister, with MLP leader William Henry Bramble becoming the first person to hold the post. The party won five of the seven seats in the 1961 and 1966 elections. The 1970 elections were the first occasion on which the MLP had faced serious opposition.Robert J Alexander & Eldon M Parker (2004) A History of Organized Labor in the English-speaking West Indies, Greenwood Publishing Group, p144 Percival Austin Bramble, son of William, had previously been a member of the MLP and was elected to the Legislative Council as an MLP candidate in the 1966 elections.Howard A Fergus (1996) Gallery Montserrat: Some Prominent People in Our History, Canoe Press, p124 However, he subsequently broke away to form the Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) as a result of controversy over the number of holiday and retirement homes being built on the island.

Exploit kits act as a kind of repository, and make it easy for users without much technical knowledge to use exploits. Users can add their own exploits to it and use them simultaneously apart from the pre-installed ones. One of the earlier kits was MPack, in 2006. Exploit kits are often designed to be modular and easy to use, enabling the addition of new vulnerabilities and the removal of existing ones. Exploit kits also provide a user interface for the person who controls them, which typically includes information on success rates and other types of statistics, as well as the ability to control their settings. A typical kit is a collection of PHP scripts that target security holes in commonly used programs such as Apple Quicktime or Mozilla Firefox. Widely used software such as Oracle Java and Adobe Systems products are targeted particularly often. Exploit kits come packed with a variety of tools ranging from hunting vulnerabilities to further automated exploitation of the security loopholes which it has discovered. Basically it follows a simple hierarchy of the five steps of hacking. The exploit kit gathers information on the victim machine, finds vulnerabilities and determines the appropriate exploit, and delivers the exploit, which typically silently drive-by downloads and executes malware, and further running post-exploitation modules to maintain further remote access to the compromised system. Lastly as a measure to cover up tracks, it uses special techniques like erasing logs to avoid detection. As days pass by exploit kits are becoming ever more sophisticated. They tend to be neatly packaged, and do not require any understanding of exploits, and very little computer proficiency. Kits may have a Web interface showing active victims and statistics. They may have a support period and updates like commercial software. Exploit kits are sold in cybercriminal circles, often with vulnerabilities already loaded onto them. A study by Solutionary's Security Engineering Research Team (SERT) found about 70% of exploit kits released in Q4 2012 come from Russia, followed by China and Brazil, with 20% not attributed. A typical, relatively unsophisticated kit may cost US$500 per month. Licenses for advanced kits have been reported to cost as much as $10,000 per month. Exploit kits are often encoded, instead of in plain PHP, to prevent unlicensed use and complicate anti-malware analysis. Further Research from Recorded Future's Threat Intelligence Team revealed that Adobe Flash Player provided six of the top 10 vulnerabilities used by exploit kits in 2016. Flash Player's popularity with cyber criminals remains even after increased Adobe security issue mitigation efforts.Kits continue to include exploitation of vulnerabilities that were patched years back, as there continues to be a significant population of unpatched machines. Exploit kits tend to be deployed covertly on legitimate Web sites that have been hacked, unknown to the site operators and visitors. Exploit kits that have been named include the MPack, Phoenix, Blackhole, Crimepack, RIG, Angler, Nuclear, Neutrino, and Magnitude exploit kits.

Built between 1820 and 1826, there are two similar wood-frame houses and a large brick commercial building, all associated with the Jacobs family, local businessmen. The buildings were listed as a group on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Jacobs buildings line the south side of Elm Street (United States Route 1), just east of the Saco River and a short way north of the city's central business district. Three buildings stand on the block between Water and Storer Streets that was purchased in 1817 by Benjamin and Moses Jacob. The westernmost building is the three-story brick Jacobs Store, which has a hip roof, and granite trim, and was built in 1826 by Benjamin Jacobs. At the eastern end stands Benjamin's house, which was built c. 1820. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, twin interior chimneys, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a delicate fanlight. At the center of the group stands the house of Moses Jacobs, which was probably identical to that of his brother at its construction, which was between 1820 and 1826. Its entrance was altered when the house was converted to a duplex, so it now has two doorways sharing an entablature. The business venture of the two brothers suffered an ignominious end. Moses Jacobs died in 1827, and Benjamin soon afterward declared bankruptcy. The houses and store they built represent a well-preserved aspect of early-19th century commercial and residential architecture in the city.

Hollingsworth both documented and contributed to the improvements in British nutrition during the Second World War. She worked with Jack Drummond at the Ministry of Food during the 1940s, and completed a revised edition of The Englishman's Food after Drummond's death. For twenty- one years, she was responsible for the nutrition bureau at the Ministry of Food and later, in the 1970s, became the director of the British Nutrition Foundation. Early life Dorothy Hollingsworth was the daughter of Arthur Hollingsworth, a pharmacist and Dorothy Coldwell, and spent her childhood in Newcastle upon Tyne. She had a degree in Chemistry from King's College, Newcastle (Durham University), graduating in 1937. Her original plan was to become a chemistry teacher but then decided to study Dietetics at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, under Sister Ruth Pybus, a pioneer in the science of nutrition. She qualified in 1939. When the Second World War started, she worked for two years as a dietician at the Royal Northern Hospital providing meals to patients and running the hospital's dietetics department. Career In 1941, Hollingsworth took a job at the Ministry of Food where she worked on a wartime food survey, designed to find out how well the population of Britain was coping with the shortages of rationing. This project later, in 1945, became the Family Food Survey, and in 1950 was reborn as the National Food Survey, which was an important resource for measuring the nutritional status of British people in the 1950s. In 1945, her job was transferred to work under Jack Drummond, the chief scientific adviser to the government at the Ministry of Food. In 1949, she took over from Magnus Pyke as the principal scientific officer at the Ministry as the head of the nutrition bureau. Her job covered all aspects of national nutrition: statistics on diet, food science, education. In 1958, she was appointed an OBE in recognition of her public service to nutrition in Britain. In 1952, Hollingsworth's former colleague Jack Drummond was brutally murdered, together with his wife and daughter, while on holiday in France. Drummond had been intending to produce a new updated version of his book The Englishman's Food, originally published in 1939. The publishers now asked Dorothy Hollingsworth to prepare the new edition, taking account of 'advances in nutrition' that had occurred in the years since 1939. Hollingsworth wrote that 'much was accomplished during the Second World War' in nutrition because 'owing to rationing and control, it was difficult to obtain an ill-balanced diet'. Her data showed that the 1947 diet was better than the 1934-38 diet 'the most striking improvements being in calcium, vitamin B1, nicotinic acid, protein (mainly in vegetable protein) and vitamin C'. Among other observations, Hollingsworth noted that, while there were still 'class differences in the consumption of vegetables and fruit' in Britain, there was, since the war, a much smaller difference between the classes in vegetable consumption. She also noted the falling popularity of milk puddings such as 'rice, tapioca and sago'. In 1970, Hollingsworth left her government job and was appointed as director of the British Nutrition Foundation, a nutrition body funded by the food industry. In her capacity as director of the BNF, she wrote letters to the papers defending the nutritional practices of the food industry. In a letter to The Times attacking the term 'factory farming', Hollingsworth argued that intensive farming of livestock meant that families on low incomes 'have been able to purchase a reasonable variety of meats for the first time ever'. She remained in her position at the BNF until 1977 and edited two volumes based on conferences organised by the BNF. In addition, Hollingsworth served on the board of many scientific and nutrition-based organisations. She was chairman of the British Dietetic Association (1947-9) and a member of the board of the Medical Research Council committee on food and nutrition research (1970-1974). Personal life Hollingsworth said in Who's Who that she enjoyed the appreciation of music and theatre, gardening and conversation with intelligent and humorous friends. Colleagues in the world of British nutrition remembered her as a person of 'good humour' with a love of travel; in meetings, she had a 'forthright and outspoken manner'. Throughout her career, she was passionately interested in working to ensure the nutritional adequacy of the British diet. She never married.

Retrieved 3 July 2015 the first son of Pastor Frederick Leberecht Richter and his wife Caroline Wilhelmina (n√©e Grauman), who were immigrants from Germany and married in Chicago. When he was a child, the family lived in St. Peter, Minnesota, and Minneapolis, before settling in the late 1870s in the newly established city of Fargo, North Dakota, where Pastor Richter became a drug store owner and physician. During the 1880s, Theophilus Richter worked as a machinist while taking a natural healing course in Chicago, based on the \\"Battle Creek\\" system devised by John Harvey Kellogg. Gordon Kennedy, \\"John Richter: the man from Fargo\\", SunFood.net, 2007. Retrieved 3 July 2015 He adopted a vegetarian diet, and also gained a diploma in the \\"Swedish movement cure\\". According to Richter, he took over some of his father's patients in Fargo, and began treating them successfully using natural remedies. In 1891 he married Violet Berry, and in the early 1900s they moved with their children from Fargo to Minneapolis. He gained a qualification and began practicing there as a naturopathic physician. By 1911, he adopted a raw food diet, influenced by the theories of Benedict Lust and talks held in Minneapolis by a Chicago doctor, George Drews, and decided to dedicate his life to the promotion of the raw vegetarian diet. After his first wife's death, he remarried in 1918, to Vera Weitzel, a native of Pennsylvania.California, County Birth, Marriage, and Death Records, 1849-1980, Ancestry.com Little is known of her background. The couple moved to Los Angeles, where he became known as Dr. John T. Richter. Shortly afterwards, the couple established a raw vegetarian food restaurant, the Eutropheon (from Greek words meaning \\"good nourishment\\"), at 833 South Olive Street. In 1925, Vera Richter published a book, Mrs. Richter's Cook-less Book, which included many of the food recipes served in the Eutropheon, and received considerable local publicity. The couple favored eating fruit in the morning, green vegetables and nuts for lunch, and root vegetables and nuts in the evening. They were opposed to the use of coffee, sugar, salt, tobacco, alcohol, meat, dairy products, cooked food, and refrigeration, and promoted massage, heliotherapy, iris diagnosis, sun gazing, barefoot walking, and naturism. They defended the ideals of the Russian Revolution, and supported US socialist leader Eugene Debs. They lectured in the area, promulgated works on health and natural living by German writers such as Arnold Ehret, Louis Kuhne, and Adolf Just, G√©raldine Gourbe, \\"Revise the Canon\\", in In the Canyon, Revise the Canon, Shelter Press and were regularly patronized and promoted by Los Angeles gymnasium owner, newspaper columnist and radio host Phillip Lovell. The Richters established two further Eutropheon restaurants in southern California, which Lovell described as \\"the only... restaurants in the country that function without the aid of a cookstove\\". In 1936, Dr. John T. Richter published Nature the Healer, a book that went through several editions. The widespread use of the term \\"raw fooder\\" has been attributed to the Richters. They believed that, with a raw food diet, people should all live to be 140 years old. According to one source, \\"the Eutropheon's phonograph boomed out Hawaiian music while uncooked soups were served with a side of raw vegetables. The body builder community of Los Angeles's first weights rooms and fitness centers rubbed shoulders with the Californian Naturmenschen, the 'nature boys.'\\" The restaurant became known as a venue where the Californian \\"nature boys\\" - who included William Pester, Robert \\"Gypsy Boots\\" Bootzin, and eden ahbez - would occasionally work, meet, stay, and share experiences. There, ahbez met singer, songwriter and radio personality Cowboy Jack Patton, who heard ahbez's song \\"Nature Boy\\" and encouraged him to pass it to Nat King Cole; Cole's recording of the song became a worldwide hit in 1948. The Richters sold the Eutropheon restaurants to a former employee, Milan Geshtacoff, during the 1940s. It is thought that the restaurants closed in the late 1940s. John Richter died in 1949, aged 85, and his wife Vera died in 1960, aged 75.

Biography Marcelle Azra Hincks was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1883, to Edgar Hincks and Louise Pemberton Hincks. She moved to England as a young girl, residing in Kensington in 1891 with her mother and elder half-siblings Lili and John Pemberton. The head of the household was Alfred du Cros, managing director of a mining corporation who was born in Ireland.

She is buried in the Church of St Candida and Holy Cross in Whitchurch Canonicorum, for, in 1939, Ellert Forbes, in a letter to The Times appealing for funds for the restoration of that church, mentions that his wife is buried there not far from the tomb of Saint Candida. He thinks this might be of note to those interested in ‚Äúinternational gastronomy‚Äù, and that ‚ÄúIt was not her only aim to teach the appreciation of good food, but she hoped that by telling us how other nations fared, we might learn to understand each other better and to live more peaceably.‚ÄùThe Times (London, England), Wednesday, Apr 19, 1939; pg. 10; Issue 48283 There is a story behind her adoption of the name Countess Morphy. In the eighteenth century, an Irish aristocrat, Michael Morphy, took his family to Spain. A son, Don Diego Morphy, settled in Louisiana. He was in San Domingo when the French Revolution began and fled aboard an English ship to Charleston, South Carolina. By a second marriage he had a daughter, Emma, who married David Hincks. Marcelle was a descendant of this union, giving her some connection with the surname Morphy.Fred Kelso, For The Love of Fungus, etc, 2009, drawing on: Mrs Regina Morphy-Voitier,The life of Paul Morphy in Vieux Carre of New-Orleans and Abroad,1926. Writing career Countess Morphy is nowadays mainly connected with cookery and food writing but she began her career in print as a dance critic. She wrote on ancient Greek dance for the Nineteenth Century'The Dance in Ancient Greece', Nineteenth Century, March 1906 and the Revue arch√©ologique,'Representations of dancing on early Greek vases', Revue arch√©ologique ser. 4, vol. 14 (1909), pp. 351-369. and began contributing to The New Age in 1910.'The Russian Dancers : M. Mordkin', The New Age, Vol. 7, No. 12 (1910), pp. 278-279; 'Personality in Dancing : Anna Pavlova', The New Age, Vol. 7, No. 13 (1910), pp. 303-304; 'The Dance Critic', The New Age, Vol. 7, No. 14 (1910), pp. 328-329;'Dancing and Anthropology', The New Age Vol. 7, No. 17 (1910), pp. 400-401; 'A Letter From Spain: A Spanish Dancer ', The New Age, Vol. 7, No. 21 (1910), pp. 492-493; 'Some Observations on Primitive Dancing', The New Age, Vol. 11. No. 18 (1912), pp. 427-428; 'Some Observations of Primitive Dancing', Vol. 11, No. 19 (1912), pp. 450-451. In that year she produced her first book, a slim volume entitled The Japanese Dance. As a critic, she also wrote about the great modern dancers of her day, such as Pavlova and Isadora Duncan. Her early cookery books were, to judge by the titles, and the speed of publication, fairly lightweight: Lightning Cookery (1931), The Kiddies Cookery Cards (1932), 100 ways of Cooking Eggs (1932), The Memorandum Cookbook (1932) and Picnic Snacks, (1933). All published by Michael Joseph in conjunction with Selfridges, they were probably associated with her employment by the department store as a cookery demonstrator. Elizabeth David recalled attending her cookery classes at Selfridges as a young girl and being impressed with her expertise. The book on which her writing reputation rests, Recipes of All Nations, was published by Selfridges in 1935. A massive book of 800 pages, each of 18 chapters covers a country. There are two other chapters; on ‚ÄòThe Creole Cookery of New Orleans‚Äô (with an introduction outlining the history of this her homeland) and a final one on ‚ÄòCookery of Many Lands‚Äô. Despite her husband‚Äôs opinion that she wrote to promote peace, she is pessimistic about the role of cookery in international affairs in her preface: Morphy goes on to say her motive in writing the book ‚Äòis to help the modern housewife who takes an intelligent interest in cooking to have excellent, varied and inexpensive food in her own home.‚Äô She does not flatter her readers, asserting that ‚ÄòEnglish food is apt to be monotonous, and the average woman is frightened of foreign cookery.‚Äô She concludes by hoping to dispel the myths about foreign cookery and introduce English housewives to the ordinary cooking of foreign lands. As well as her own expertise, she called on that of various chefs who cooked in ‚Äòethnic‚Äô restaurants to be found in London in her day: Mr S.K. Cheng of the Shanghai Emporium and Restaurant in Greek Street advised on Chinese food and Madam N. Wolkoff, proprietor of the Russian Tea Room in London helped with the Russian chapter. (So, if housewives did not cook foreign food, middle-class ones in London could experience it in restaurants.)Morphy, Recipes of all Nations, pp. 711, 422. Although some critics picked on the inevitable mistakes which occurred in this giant and wide-ranging book, and some ridiculed the recipe for fricass√©e of iguana from Guinea, on the whole the work was greeted with enthusiasm and was in print for a long period. A review in the Times noted that she wrote for those needing to cook a good meal for a hungry family and thus cited bourgeois and peasant recipes, which were also economical. The reviewer questioned the absence of chapters on British cookery- did she hold it in too low esteem? The Times (London, England), Friday, Feb 01, 1935; pg. 9; Issue 46977. Nowadays, books on foreign cuisines, many of them associated with television series, are common. Recipes of All Nations is the ancestor of these and it is still a good read, and useful in the kitchen, today.

The tunnelling companies were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services. The unit is particularly known for its role at Carri√®re Wellington and during the Battle of Arras. Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter-tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton- Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most British tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The Royal Australian Engineers formed four mining units for the British Expeditionary Force, all of which were operational by March 1916. Three were specialist companies of tunnellers (1st, 2nd, 3rd), while the Australian Electrical Mechanical Boring and Mining Company was tasked with carrying out related repairs. A Canadian tunnelling unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history Formation After New Zealand had become the first Dominion to agree the formation of a Royal Engineer tunnelling company on 17 September 1915, the government encouraged early enlistment to form the New Zealand Mining Corps. On 11 October, specialist tunnellers' training began on the Avondale racecourse near Auckland. The tunnelling company numbered 16 engineering officers and 407 other ranks, plus one officer and two men from the Medical Corps, 19 men from the New Zealand Army Service Corps, and one man from the New Zealand Army Pay Corps, a total of 446 soldiers. On 18 December 1915, the men of the New Zealand Tunnelling Company left Auckland on board the SS Ruapehu. After stop-overs in Montevideo and Dakar, the ship arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916. After further training in England, the unit was deployed to northern France. Vimy British-dug fighting tunnel in Vimy sector On 10 March 1916, the New Zealand tunnellers arrived in Le Havre, becoming the first New Zealand soldiers on the Western Front. Five days later they relieved the French 7/1 compagnie d'ing√©nieurs territoriaux in the \\"Labyrinth\\" sector of the Western Front between Roclincourt and √âcurie in northern France. The German \\"Labyrinth\\" stronghold was located near Neuville-Saint-Vaast, between Arras and Vimy and not far from Notre Dame de Lorette. On 29 March 1916, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company exchanged position with the 185th Tunnelling Company and moved to Roclincourt- Chantecler, a kilometre south of their old sector. On 7 April, the tunneling units of the German Army carried out their first underground offensive against the New Zealand Tunnelling Company. On 5 May, the New Zealanders responded by firing four mines under the German lines, which marked the first offensive underground action of the unit. During summer and much of autumn 1916, the unit further developed and expanded its mining to create an effective underground defence at Roclincourt-Chantecler. The unit seems to have shared the Neuville-Saint-Vaast sector with the 176th Tunnelling Company, which had moved to Neuville-Saint-Vaast in April 1916 and remained there for a considerable time, and the 172nd Tunnelling Company, which was relieved in this area by the 2nd Australian Tunnelling Company in May 1916.

Map of chalk areas in northern France Tunnel and mining trolley in Carri√®re Wellington On 15 November 1916, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company ended its offensive mining operations and started preparations for the Battle of Arras (9 April ‚Äì 16 May 1917). Henry Armytage Sanders was sent to France and met up with the New Zealand Tunnelling Company on 8 April 1917.

The British forces controlling Arras had decided to re-use the ancient underground quarries in the town to aid a planned offensive against the Germans, whose trenches ran through what are now the eastern suburbs of the town. The underground quarries were to be linked up by tunnels so that they could be used both as shelters from the incessant German shelling and as a means of conveying troops to the front in secrecy and safety. From October 1916, the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers had been constructing tunnels for the troops, including Carri√®re Wellington, a former underground quarry in Ronville near Arras. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company had carried out a first exploration of the underground quarries in the Ronville and Saint- Sauveur districts of Arras on 5 November 1916. (For a map of the Arras underground system, see here.) While the New Zealanders were moving into place, the 184th Tunnelling Company began work on connection tunnels at Saint- Sauveur on 25 November 1916. Shortly afterwards, on 9 December 1916, 43 MƒÅoris of the MƒÅori Pioneer Battalion joined the New Zealand Tunnelling Company at Carri√®re Wellington. The Arras region is chalky and therefore easily excavated; under Arras itself is a vast network (called the boves) of caverns, underground quarries, galleries and sewage tunnels. The engineers devised a plan to add new tunnels to this network so that troops could arrive at the battlefield in secrecy and in safety. The scale of this undertaking was enormous: in one sector alone four Tunnelling Companies (of 500 men each) worked around the clock in 18-hour shifts for two months. The work was difficult and dangerous. In the New Zealand Tunnelling Company alone, 41 tunnellers died and another 151 were injured during counter-mining operations against the Germans, whose own tunnellers sought to disrupt the Allied tunneling operations. The tunnellers named the individual quarries after their home towns (Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch, Russell and Dunedin for the New Zealanders, and Glasgow, Edinburgh, Crewe and London for the Britons). Assault tunnels were also dug, stopping a few metres short of the German line, ready to be blown open by explosives on the first day of the battle. On 4 January 1917, the unit started putting in electricity in the Ronville quarries. Two weeks later, most of the work on the connection tunnels in the Ronville underground system was complete. On 24 January, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company began installing direction signs in the underground system. The next day, they started early works to organise a tramway line into the Ronville and Saint-Sauveur systems. By that time, the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers had constructed 20 kilometres of tunnels, graded as subways (foot traffic only), tramways (with rails for hand-drawn trolleys, for taking ammunition to the line and bringing casualties back from it) and railways (a light railway system). The tunnel system could accommodate 24,000 men and was equipped with running water, electric light, kitchens, latrines, a small power station and a medical centre with a fully equipped operating theatre.\\"The Arras tunnels\\", NZ Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 1 February 2008 In addition to this, conventional mines were laid under the front lines, ready to be blown immediately before the assault. In the meantime, German sappers were actively conducting their own underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine. On 14‚Äì16 March 1917, the German withdrawal on the Hindenburg Line (Siegfried Stellung) made it impossible to attack from the Ronville system. Despite this setback, electricity was installed and tested in the whole system beneath Arras by 3 April 1917, ready for the start of the Battle of Arras on 9 April. On the first day of the battle, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company opened three tunnels located at the end of Saint-Sauveur system, allowing infantrymen to appear suddenly in the German trenches. Owing to the German withdrawal from their front line south- east of Arras, the unit also fired the only mine that was used on the Arras front on 9 April. It was located to the north-east at Blagny, and was a charge, blown by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company at zero, 5.30 a.m. It destroyed two German dugouts, of trench and a concrete pillbox. However, it also stunned and apparently buried some members of the 13th Royal Scots and impeded their assault temporarily.

On 5 May 1917, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company began early development of tunnels beneath German trenches located between Gavrelle and Roeux east of Arras. After the end of the Battle of Arras in May 1917, the unit focused mainly on creating deep dugouts beneath British trenches, which was continued into the winter months. On 5 November 1917, the unit witnessed the explosion of a damage ammunition stock at Wanquetin, some west of Arras. Spring Offensive On 21 March 1918, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company was present at Arrasduring the large German Spring Offensive, and began work on trenches south-west of the town. From May to July, the unit returned to constructing underground shelters beneath the British trenches. The unit stayed in Arras until 14 July. Somme On 15 July 1918, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Marieux on the Somme, where it began constructing dug-outs beneath the British trenches. On 20 August, the unit ended its underground works in the sector. Havrincourt Officers of the New Zealand Tunnelling Company pose at the completed Hermies‚ÄìHavrincourt bridge over the Canal du Nord, October 1918. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company was next involved in the Battle of Havrincourt, opening on 12 September 1918, which began the German retreat back to the Belgian border. On 27 September the company was joined by 565th (Wiltshire) Army Troops Company, RE, recruited from railwaymen and specially trained in building heavy bridges. This company had already suffered severe casualties building a ramp down the face of a retaining wall into the dry Canal du Nord. Now, under VI Corps Troops RE,Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 22 & 63. the two companies (14 officers and 310 men in total) built a Hopkins steel bridge across the canal between Hermies and Havrincourt. This was the largest heavy steel bridge erected on the Western Front during the war, with a span of above a deep gap; in total the bridge was long, launched by rollers. It took 80 three-ton lorry loads to bring up the material, and the total time to unload and erect the bridge was 104 hours. It was opened for traffic on 2 October and completed on 5 October.Gittins, pp. 142‚Äì3, 145. In the autumn of 1918, the unit constructed further military bridges that allowed the Allied troops to cross three main river obstacles: the Canal de l'Escaut, crossing Cambrai and going to the Canal de Saint-Quentin on the south, the Selle and the Ecaillon, two parallel rivers, separated from only two or three miles, in the southwest of Quesnoy. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company reinstalled the communication roads and railways above natural obstacles at Noyelles-sur-Escaut, Masni√®res, Cambrai, Solesmes, Saint-Waast and Romeries. Armistice After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company stayed in France until the demobilisation of the first New Zealand tunnellers began in early December. On 30 January 1919, the unit arrived in Great Britain, from where the soldiers left for home on 14 March. On 23 April, the last men of the New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived in Auckland. The next day, the unit was formally dissolved.

His brother William Astor Chanler was a noted soldier and explorer and was elected to the US Congress in 1898. His sister Elizabeth Astor Winthrop Chanler married author John Jay Chapman. Career Chaloner received some schooling in England and later returned to the United States, where he received his bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University. Chaloner went on study at the Coll√®ge de France and the Ecole des Sciences Politiques. On his twenty- first birthday in 1883, Chaloner inherited the estate at Rokeby along with $100,000 for its maintenance, however after his marriage began to disintegrate, he sold the title to his sister Margaret for a nominal fee and moved to North Carolina.Donna M. Lucey, Archie and Am√©lie: Love and Madness in the Gilded Age. New York: Harmony Books, 2007. . In 1892 he was accepted as a compatriot of the New York Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. On June 1, 1908 he registered to have his last name legally changed from \\"Chanler\\" to Chaloner, which he believed to have been the surname's original spelling. Chaloner helped found Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, where he successfully built an electric power-generating station and a cotton mill. Later in his life his erratic behavior caused his family to have him declared legally insane, a measure that estranged him from his family until 1919, when the family reconciled. Chaloner was highly philanthropic where education was concerned and around 1890 established the Paris Prize Fund, later renamed the John Armstrong Chaloner Paris Prize Foundation in 1917. Insanity allegations and psychiatric history Image from Robbery Under Law. Chaloner believed it proved his resemblance to Napoleon. By 1896 Chaloner began to claim that he was an \\"experimental psychologist of great insight\\" and through his work with the \\"X-Faculty\\" he began to exhibit increasingly erratic behavior. This provoked concern with his family and on March 13, 1897 they had him involuntarily committed to the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum in White Plains, New York. For his part, Chaloner believed that he was being committed so his family could take charge of his estate and experiments and wrote several sonnets to illustrate this belief. He was declared insane on March 13, 1897 and a New York court recommended that he be permanently institutionalized, however Chaloner escaped the following year and went to a private clinic, where he was deemed able to function in regular society. Soon after, Chaloner began challenging the court's decision and laws on mental illness, which brought him into the national spotlight. He was later declared sane in both Virginia and North Carolina and some of his proponents compared his experiments to research on parapsychology. During this time Chaloner publicly lectured on his X-Faculty experiments, but his lectures frequently featured diatribes against his family and psychiatry in general. He also published several books including Four Years Behind the Bars of \\"Bloomingdale,\\" or, The Bankruptcy of Law in New York, (1906) and Hell: Per a Spirit-Message Therefrom (Alleged): a Study in Graphic-Automatism (1912). In 1909 Chaloner received additional attention when he accidentally shot and killed his neighbor John Gillard at Merry Mills. Gillard's wife had fled to Chaloner's home due to domestic abuse. While he was acquitted of responsibility, Chaloner paid for Gillard's funeral and gravestone, and also suffered a nervous breakdown that caused him to leave Merry Mills for several months. Chaloner would later write about Gillard's death in Robbery Under Law; Or, The Battle of the Millionaires: A Play in Three Acts. Personal life Am√©lie Louise Rives On June 14, 1888 he married the author Am√©lie Louise Rives. The marriage was considered scandalous by Chaloner's family, who disapproved of her due to erotic passages in her book The Quick or the Dead? A Study‚Äîespecially as one of the characters greatly resembled Chaloner. Chaloner's marriage to Rives was notoriously unhappy and in 1895 Rives sought and was successfully granted a divorce in South Dakota. Rives remarried only months later to Prince Pierre Troubetzkoy and Chaloner further scandalized his family by purchasing Merry Mills, the estate near the Troubetzkoys' home in Albemarle County, Virginia. Chaloner became close friends with the Troubetzkoys and also continued to pay Rives a yearly sum of money‚Äîevents that caused his brother Robert Winthrop Chanler to call him a \\"looney\\".

She was named the Distinguished Young Woman of Mississippi in 2011 and crowned Miss Mississippi 2015. Roberts competed for the Miss America 2016 title on September 13, 2015, and was named first runner-up. Pageant career Early pageants In July 2010, Roberts won the Covington County's Junior Miss title and competed in July 2010 finals for the state Distinguished Young Woman title. After two days of competition in talent, fitness, scholastic achievement, and self-expression, Roberts was named 2011 Distinguished Young Woman of Mississippi. She earned a $10,000 scholarship prize from the Mississippi Junior Miss Scholarship Foundation and the right to compete for the national title. Roberts was named second runner- up for the national title in June 2011, earning a $15,000 scholarship prize. She also won $1,000 scholarships for scholastic and talent category awards plus $1,500 for winning the Bel Air Mall Community Service Award. In October 2012, Roberts won the Miss University of Southern Mississippi 2013 title. She competed in the Miss Mississippi pageant in July 2013 with the platform \\"Pages of Love\\" and a classical violin performance in the talent portion of the competition. She was named first runner-up to winner Chelsea Rick. Roberts skipped the 2014 competition season to focus on her studies. Miss Mississippi 2015 In October 2014, Roberts was crowned Miss University of Southern Mississippi 2015 which made her eligible to compete at the 2015 Miss Mississippi pageant. She entered the state pageant at the Vicksburg Convention Center in June 2015 as one of 30 qualifiers. Roberts's competition talent was a shred of the classical violin performance of a variation around \\"Zapateado\\" by Pablo de Sarasate, Op. 23 No. 2. Her platform is \\"Pages of Love\\", donating more than 25,000 books to children's hospitals, shelters, and schools. Roberts won the competition on Saturday, June 27, 2015, when she received her crown from outgoing Miss Mississippi titleholder Jasmine Murray.

Roberts was named first runner-up to Betty Cantrell and awarded a $25,000 scholarship prize. In addition, Roberts was awarded the $500 Louanne Gamba Non-Finalist Instrumentalist scholarship for her classical violin performance. However, her performance of the violin has been widely criticized by members of the music community, who have noted that her performance was riddled with errors and severely lacked the technique, musicianship, and knowledge of the correct notes and rhythms required for the virtuosic piece she intended to play. Personal life and education Roberts is a native of Mount Olive, Mississippi, and a 2011 graduate of Sumrall High School. Her father is James Roberts and her mother is Danna Warren Roberts. Roberts is a May 2015 graduate of the University of Southern Mississippi where she majored in biochemistry with a minor in biology. She was a recipient of the Barry M.

In 1975 Diamond was voted Drummer of the Year in a poll held by Premier Drums. He committed suicide by hanging in 2004 after a long-running dispute with noisy neighbours. Early years Born in Aldershot in Hampshire, the son of Isabella (n√©e Copland) and Albert Victor Diamond, Norman Diamond gained the nickname \\"Dinky\\" as a child because of his small stature. He had three sisters, Maureen, Daphne and Margaret and a brother, David and attended St. Michael's Church of England Secondary School in Aldershot. A self-taught drummer, Diamond played in a variety of local bands including Sound of Time in his native town while working in electrical distribution. Sparks 1973-1975 Sparks in 1974, l-r: Ian Hampton, Russell Mael, Ron Mael, Adrian Fisher and Diamond. Founding members of Sparks, the brothers Ron and Russell Mael, moved to England in 1973 with a new manager, John Hewlett, founder of John's Children, and a deal from Island Records, thanks in part to the exposure garnered by a BBC2 television Old Grey Whistle Test performance.Easlea, Daryl (July 2003). \\"Sparks Interview\\". Record Collector Magazine Issue 287 The Mael brothers placed an advertisement in music weekly Melody Maker which read: \\"Wanted bass player for Sparks. Must be beard free and exciting\\". As a result, Martin Gordon was hired. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Diamond on drums, in the midst of power strikes and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough Kimono My House in 1974, scoring a number 2 hit with the single \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\". Remembering Diamond's early years with Sparks, producer Muff Winwood said \\"Dinky was by no means a great drummer but he suited the material perfectly\\". Sparks became a UK teen sensation, appearing on the cover of Melody Maker, Record Mirror and many other pop magazines, both in the UK and Europe. Hits such as \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\", \\"Amateur Hour\\" and \\"Never Turn Your Back On Mother Earth\\" led to many appearances on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops. Gordon and Fisher were later replaced, but Diamond temporarily survived the cull. In 1975 the revised band, including Diamond, toured the US promoting the Kimono My House and Propaganda albums. Diamond had enjoyed being a member of a high-profile band, and would sit in the office at Island Records, answering the telephones and reading paperwork. Here he met Lee Packham, (secretary to 'Kimono My House' producer Muff Winwood) whom he married in 1976.

However, that was also his last year with Sparks as the Mael brothers decided to move back to the USA and there they would using mainly local session musicians. Diamond's departure from Sparks affected him badly,Easlea, unknown page but he went on to appear with a number of bands, including (from 1980) the Sparks spin-off The Four Squares. Despite the name, the band actually had five members: Diamond on drums, Sparks' former manager John Hewlett on vocals, former Sparks guitarist Trevor White on bass, and two guitarists - Adrian Fisher plus Chuck \\"Bob Davies\\" Wagon (also of The Dickies) who shot himself before the band's main recording session at Bearsville Studios were complete. Suicide Aldershot Crematorium When The Four Squares failed Diamond gradually drifted out of music and after a series of jobs, in 1998 he and his partner of 21 years Jane Gant moved into a small terraced house in Sandhurst in Berkshire where he was troubled by a noisy neighbour and her partner for five years who slept all day and played loud music all night and who argued loudly in the street. At the same time Diamond had recently left a job he enjoyed and taken one which he hated, working for an internet gardening company. When the police and local housing association did not take action against the neighbour despite numerous complaints, Diamond got drunk and hanged himself from the loft ceiling in his home on 10 September 2004, though news of his death was only made widely known five months later when the verdict of suicide was confirmed at inquest. A heavy drinker, he had more than four times the legal driving limit of alcohol in his blood. The neighbour, Lisa Norman'Suicide of Sparks Drummer' - Daily Mirror 5 February 2005 (then aged 27), told the Daily Mail, \\"I can't believe I'm being blamed.\\"'Drummer was driven to suicide' - Daily Mail - 5 February 2005 Her partner said, \\"He [Mr Diamond] had a history of alcohol abuse, and all the blame is being concentrated on my partner.

Solapuri chadars were the first product in Maharashtra to obtain Geographical Indication (GI) status. History Solapur is known for its textile industry. Once it had Asia's largest spinning mills. The development of the handloom weaving industry in Solapur seems to have commenced during the regime of the Peshwas. There were numerous small independent artisan weavers in the industry. Each artisan-house had one or two looms which were generally handled by the head of the family. The family was the unit of work and the women and the children helped the weaver in preparatory processes and in some cases in dyeing also. The rise of the modern factory in India in the 1970s altered the organisation of the local hand-loom weaving industry. Manufactured by padmashali weavers from South India since their presence in solapur from 1950's.

The organization's services are available 24 hours a day, every day, throughout the US, UK, and Canada and can be reached by texting HOME to 741741, 85258, or 686868 respectively. Crisis Counselors help texters move from a \\"hot moment to a cool calm\\" through an approach that is centered on empathetic listening, collaborative problem-solving, and referral suggestions. Crisis Text Line has been growing extensively in popularity since its launch in 2013 and seeks to expand its services to Ireland, Australia, South Africa, and Latin America. As of December 5, 2019, Crisis Text Line has processed over 105 million text messages. The text line is notable among hotlines for its triage system, in which conversations are assessed by an algorithm for severity and queued accordingly, as opposed to being queued chronologically. Crisis Text Line is also notable for possessing the largest set of mental health data in the world. The organization uses anonymous aggregated texting data to share prevalent mental health trends across the United States and to continuously improve the quality of its crisis intervention services. History Crisis Text Line was conceptualized as a result of Do Something's mobile interactions with its members. Nancy Lublin, Do Something's former C.E.O., began creating Crisis Text Line after members of the Do Something organization started reaching out via text for personal support. Shortly after, the crisis intervention service was given a quiet launch in August 2013 through a text message to Do Something members in Chicago and El Paso, and was soon being used by texters in every United States area code. By 2015, the text line was being contacted by more than 350 texters-in-crisis every day. In early 2015, Lublin coordinated meetings over a week \\"to raise her first round of funding.\\" And \\"[b]y the end of the week, she had her 'angel' round of philanthropic capital, $5 million, mostly from tech entrepreneurs.\\" In July 2015, it was announced that Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile would be waiving fees for use of the service, and that texts to Crisis Text Line would not appear on billing records, amidst privacy concerns. AT&T; then followed suit. In September 2015, Crisis Text Line announced via the Do Something blog that it would be taking steps to become a resource for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing including training and education for its Crisis Counselors. In January 2016, Chief Data Scientist Bob Filbin was highlighted in The Chronicle of Philanthropy as one of their 40 Under 40 for his work using data to inform Crisis Text Line's efforts. He explains that Crisis Text Line's data collection is centered on \\"people in their greatest moment of crisis,\\" and that \\"most of the other data on mental health and crisis is survey data, which is collected after the fact.\\" On June 16, 2016, Crisis Text Line announced that it has raised $23.8 million from Reid Hoffman, Melinda Gates, The Ballmer Group, and Omidyar Network who are tech titans. In March 2017, Crisis Text Line began offering its services via Facebook Messenger and reported passing its 100 million message milestone in March 2019. In 2018, Crisis Text Line launched its services in Canada through a partnership with the Kids Help Phone organization. In May 2019, they launched their United Kingdom affiliate, Shout, with the Heads Together Foundation. The text line plans to eventually have at least one affiliate in every country. In April 2020, Business Insider reports that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused \\"a dramatic spike in people seeking help from crisis text hotlines...The spike coincides with the worsening of the novel coronavirus worldwide, as well as historic layoffs in the US\\". In just a number of weeks, \\"the number of texts to the hotline has been 47% to 116% higher than an average day\\". On June 12, 2020, the Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate CEO and co-founder Nancy Lublin after three days of a Twitter campaign #NotMyCrisisTextLine Administration The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the organization's activities and goals, and includes founder and CEO Nancy Lublin, Danah Boyd, Ph.D., the principal researcher at Microsoft Research, and Elizabeth Cutler of SoulCycle. Crisis Text Line also has a clinical advisory board that works to improve Crisis Counselor trainings and texter outcomes. Other boards include a Data, Ethics, and Research Advisory Board as well as a Legal and Public Safety Advisory Board.  Crisis Counselors  Crisis Counselors are volunteers who are at least eighteen years old, and must apply for acceptance into the training program. They are required to submit a background check, complete thirty hours of training, and pass a final evaluation. Graduated Crisis Counselors commit to a minimum of 200 volunteer hours. While taking shifts, Crisis Counselors are supervised by paid Supervisor staff members who typically have advanced degrees in counseling, mental health, or crisis intervention.  Strategy  Sign promoting the Crisis Text Line at the Golden Gate Bridge Crisis Text Line believes that everyone deserves immediate \\"mental health support at their fingertips.\\" People who are in any type of crisis can reach out to the text line and expect to be connected with a Crisis Counselor in under 5 minutes, although wait times may vary during high-volume moments. Once connected, a Crisis Counselor will introduce themselves and encourage the texter to share their feelings at a comfortable pace. Crisis Counselors actively listen, build rapport, and engage in collaborative problem-solving with the texter in order to identify potential coping strategies. An individualized short-term action plan is created to help the texter cope with the crisis and to remain safe. At the end of every conversation, texters are given the option to provide feedback about their experience with the Crisis Counselor. Conversations usually lasts anywhere from 15-45 minutes. If the texter is in imminent risk of suicide or harm and is unwilling to separate themselves from the means of harm and create a safety plan, emergency services may be contacted in order to ensure the safety of the texter. This is a last resort. Active rescues are carried out in less than 1% of conversations. Crisis Counselors also share a variety of resources with texters such as referrals to advocacy networks, hotlines, and mental health support websites. Crisis Text Line upholds specific criteria for referrals and does not endorse products or services that contain fees. The nature of Crisis Text Line's services is not long-term counseling. The text line should not be viewed as a substitute for mental health treatment or professional health care. Crisis Text Line helps texters reach short-term solutions to crises but cannot serve as any type of therapy. Data collection Crisistrends.org was launched in August 2014 to collect and analyze anonymous texting data derived from the activities of the Crisis Text Line platform. The data is used to display crisis trends according to texter gender, age, race, and ethnicity. It is shared with the public to help decrease stigma around mental health support. Research agencies and institutions also can have access to this data for research purposes. Crisis Text Line has many open data partnerships, one of them being a collaboration with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that aims to predict and prevent veteran suicides. Since Crisis Text Line's launch in 2013, there have been 8 research papers published based on Crisis Text Line's data. More papers are expected to emerge as more data is collected. In 2014, the organization found that 3 percent of texters were using 34% of organization resources. These texters were continuously using Crisis Text Line's services as a long- term \\"replacement for therapy,\\" which prompted the development of systems to identify these \\"circling texters\\" and to address the imbalance in resource application.  Use of algorithms  Crisis Text Line uses a triaging algorithm to identify texters who are at most imminent risk for suicide. Conversations that contain high-risk words and phrases are marked by the triage system and moved to the front of the texting queue, allowing Crisis Counselors to immediately respond to high-risk texters in under 5 minutes even during high-volume times. Crisis Text Line also uses an algorithm to predict spikes in texting volume. This technology enables spikes to be detected 6-8 times faster, allowing for quicker staffing of Crisis Counselor volunteers on the platform.  Crisis trends A map depicting frequency of anxiety in the United States, made using Crisis Text Line data and available on crisistrends.org in August 2014 According to the data found on Crisistrends.org, approximately 75% of texters are less than 25 years old and encompass a wide variety of demographics. 19% of texters are from the 10% lowest-income zip codes in the United States, and 14% of texters identify as Hispanic/Latinx. In December 2015, Crisis Text Line releasing data indicating that bullying and harassment against Muslims was on the rise. They experienced a noteworthy increase in volume immediately after Donald Trump's election as President of the United States. There was also a spike in conversations that dealt with issues such immigration, sexual assault, and LGBTQ+ rights during this time period. The Wall Street Journal reported on Crisis Text Line's data about prom-related crises, noting that financial concerns were the most prevalent cause of prom-related conversations with the service. Analysis of the service's data around military texters revealed that active duty service members and veterans make up 2.4% of texters, and that these texters are more likely to be struggling with suicidal ideation or substance abuse. Crisis Text Line's data also reveals that sadness is more likely to be reported in conversations around the summertime, particularly with LGBTQ+ texters who may be returning home to \\"unaccepting families.\\" This is indicated by the frequent use of words such as \\"lesbian, virginity, and dumped.\\" See also *National Suicide Prevention Lifeline *Samaritans (charity) *The Trevor Project *Trans Lifeline  References  External links DoSomething.org Articles * Prince William reveals he is secret helpline volunteer, June 5, 2020, bbc.com.

These parties do not contest elections against each other as they only operate in the named constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Sometimes these are collectively referred to as \\"(The) Green Party\\", for example in the media and opinion polls. All three parties were formed in 1990 when the then Green Party separated into the national parties. The first three Green parties are members of the European Green Party, a European political party which is a federation of Green Parties across more than 30 countries in Europe. History of the Green Party The PEOPLE Party was founded in February 1972 by Tony and Lesley Whittaker, Freda Sanders, and Michael Benfield, a group of surveyors who were concerned about the state of economics, employment, defence, energy (fuel) supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, as then seen within an ecological perspective. After the 1975 Conference, PEOPLE changed its name to the Ecology Party to gain more recognition as a party of environmental concern. The Ecology Party was seen as the second step for Green politics in the United Kingdom. In 1976, the party won its first seats on Rother District Council, East Sussex, and on Kempsey Parish Council, Hereford & Worcester. Jonathan Tyler was elected Chairman of the Ecology Party that same year, and both Tony and Lesley Whittaker took a step back from active involvement in the party. The 1977 Party Conference saw Jonathan Porritt elected to its National Executive Committee. In the 1979 and 1983 General Elections, membership and recognition of the Ecology Party greatly increased. By July 1980, consensus in the Ecology Party was focusing towards decentralisation and non-violent direct action. Following the success of the Social Democratic Party in the UK and Die Grunen in Germany, the Ecology Party resolved to change its name to the Green Party. The Green Party of the United Kingdom was founded in June 1985. The party had increased success in the 1987 General Election. By 1990, the Scottish and Northern Irish branches of the Green Party voted to break away and form their own parties, citing differences in opinion on party policy and the growing support for Scottish independence. The remainder of the Green Party became the Green Party of England & Wales. The Welsh and London branches of the Green Party continue to operate as semi-autonomous branches of the Green Party of England & Wales, however, in July 2018, the Wales Green Party held a vote to decide on whether or not to separate from the Green Party of England & Wales and become a separate party. Of those who voted, 65% voted in favour of the status quo. In 2006, the Green Party of Northern Ireland resolved to amalgamate with, and become a branch of, the Green Party of Ireland. Isle of Man Green Party The Isle of Man Green Party was founded in August 2016. Unlike the other three Green parties, the Isle of Man Green Party holds no historic links to the PEOPLE, Ecology or UK Green parties. The Isle of Man Green Party does not have any formal links with the other three Green parties, but does intend on forging relations with other Green parties worldwide and sends delegates to the Green Isles Alliance, a panel of representatives from the Green parties within the British Isles.

The Chronicles were the main form of historical narrative until the middle of the 16th century, the time of Ivan the Terrible, when they gave primacy to another historiographical genre ‚Äî chronographs. Copies Rus' Chronicles survive in some hundreds copies (codices). Some Chronicles are known in multiple versions, but others are known from only a single copy. Every chronicle was a svod, or \\"collection\\" because it included materials from various earlier chronicles. Individual Chronicles were revised, shortened or added to with entries on the events of the last year or even decades. There are probably several tens of svods in existence. –°haracteristic Chroniclers were mainly churchmen. Rus' Chronicles were composed in monasteries, at the princely (see: knyaz) courts (later at the tsar's courts) and in the offices of Metropolitan. Individual Chronicles often contradicted each other. Chronicles typically consisted of collections of short factual entries for the preceding year, often including speeches and dialogues between princes. In some instances the chroniclers would provid an extended narrative on the most significant events of Slavic history, often embellished with literary phrases, including standard speech formulas, epithet's, rhetorical figures and others. Aleksey Shakhmatov was the foremost expert in textology of Rus' –°hronicles. He considered that the main part of —Åhronicle texts were svods, that is collections of separate records from different sources, and every new —Åhronicle was a svod of some previous —Åhronicles and newly added historical recordsAleksey Shakhmatov.

Chronicle Genealogy by Aleksey Shakhmatov The Primary Chronicle of the beginning of the 12th century is the oldest survived Rus' chronicle, narrating the earliest history of Rus'. However Shakhmatov paid attention on abundance of entries of the 11th century about Novgorod, which are read in Novgorod First Chronicle (of the 15th century), but absent in Primary Chronicle. This and some others textual facts were a base for his theory on the beginning of Novgorod First Chronicle includes text, older than Primary Chronicle. The scholar named it \\"Primary Svod\\" (Collection) and dated as the end of the 11th century. This svod was also a basis for Primary Chronicle. If two or more —Åhronicle coincide with each other up to a certain year, one —Åhronicle copied from another (this is rarely) or this —Åhronicles had a common source, arrived to this year - older svod. Shakhmatov discovered and developed a method of study on chronicle (svod) genealogy. Rested on deep textual analysis, Shakhmatov built extensive genealogy of Rus' Chronicles. He connected most of this chronicles and created genealogy table, in which extant chronicles of the 14th-17th centuries went back not only to \\"Primary Svod\\", but also to earlier hypothetical svods of the 11th century and even to historical records of the end of the 10th century. Shakhmatov's method and theories began a mainstream in Russian Chronicle studies.–ë–æ–±—Ä–æ–≤ –ê. –ì. –ù–æ–≤–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–µ –ª–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å–∏ XV –≤–µ–∫–∞. ‚Äî –°–ü–±. : –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –ë—É–ª–∞–Ω–∏–Ω, 2000. ‚Äî 287 —Å. History Rus' Chronicles were systematically prepared from the middle of the 11th century. There were two centers of Rus' Chronicle preparation in this early period: Kiev (the capital of early Rus') and Novgorod. The Primary Chronicle of the beginning of the 12th century was a combination of Kievan and Novgorodian chronicle records, as well as the Novgorod First Chronicle. Primary Chronicle survives in Laurentian and Hypatian chronicles (codices). This two centers, South and North, were remaining later. Chronicles of South Rus' princedoms (knyazhestva) of 12th-13th centuries survives in Hypatian Chronicle: hypothetical \\"Kievan Chronicle\\",In quotes, there are hypothetical chronicle, existence of which is supposed in textology studies chosen from Hypatian Chronicle, was a continuation of Primary Chronicle and covered events from 1118 to 1200; Galician‚ÄìVolhynian Chronicle, also containing in Hypatian Chronicle, covered events in Galician and Volhynian princedoms from 1201 to 1292.–õ–∏—Ö–∞—á–µ–≤–∞ –û.–ü. –õ–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å—å –ò–ø–∞—Ç—å–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è // –°–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –∏ –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–µ–π –†—É—Å–∏ / –ê–ù –°–°–°–†. –ò–†–õ–ò; –û—Ç–≤. —Ä–µ–¥. –î.–°. –õ–∏—Ö–∞—á–µ–≤. ‚Äî –õ.: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 1987. ‚Äî –í—ã–ø. 1 (XI ‚Äì –ø–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞ XIV –≤.). ‚Äî –°. 236; –õ–∏—Ö–∞—á–µ–≤–∞ –û.–ü. –õ–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å—å –ò–ø–∞—Ç—å–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è // –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–µ–π –†—É—Å–∏. –ë–∏–æ–±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å / –ø–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥. –û.–í. –¢–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ–≤–∞. - –ú.: –ü—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ, 1996 Chronicles of Rostov, Vladimir and Pereyaslavl of Suzdal of the end of 12th - the beginning of the 13th century better remained in Laurentian, Radziwill chronicles (codices) and Chronicler of Pereyaslavl of Suzdal. Hypatian Chronicle of the end of the 13th - the beginning of the 14th centuries is an All-Rus' svod in south redaction (presumedly). It survives in —Åopies of the 15th-18th centuries.

Chronicle svod was made in Tver about 1412, it reflected additional revision (similar to Troitskaya Chronicle) of All-Rus' svod of the end of the 14th - the beginning of the 15th century. This \\"Tverian svod\\" reflected in Simeon Chronicle and Rogozhskiy Chronicler. \\"Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod\\" of the 1430s (or \\"Svod of 1448\\" according to Shakhmatov) was compiled at office of Moscow Metropolitan and united All-Rus' and Novgorodian chronicles. The svod was preserved in Sofia First and Novgorod Fourth chronicles. First known Moscow grand princely appeared at the middle of the 15th century. \\"Chronicle Svod of 1472\\" reflected in Vologda-Perm and Nicanor chronicles. Basis of \\"Svod of 1472\\" was \\"Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod\\", edited by Moscow grand princely chronicler, who brought censorship, excluded in particular the mentions of Novgorodian liberty, because Novgorod State was joint to Moscow Grand Princedom. In the end of the 1470s, \\"Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod\\", the svod similar to Troitskaya Chronicle and other sources was compiled together. This compilation was censored even more than \\"Svod of 1472\\". The \\"Compilation of the 1470s\\" reflected in \\"Moscow Grand Princely Svod of 1479\\", surviving in copy of the 18th century, and in its later redaction was continued up to 1492. This \\"Svod of 1479\\" underlaid all of official —Åhronicles of the end of the 15th - the 16th centuries. The compilation of the 1470s also reflected in the first part of Yermolin Chronicle. The \\"Svod of Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery\\" contained text, independent of Moscow Grand Princedom. This svod reflected in the second part of Yermolin Chronicle and in so-called Abridged Chronicle Svods of the end of the 15th century. \\"Rostov Archbishop Svod\\" of the 1480s reflected in Typographical Chronicle. Another \\"Chronicle Svod of 1480s\\", made in unofficial church sphere, reflected in \\"Svod of 1518\\", which in turn reflected in Sofia Second Chronicle and Lvov Chronicle. Ioasaf Chronicle was made the end of the 1520s at office of Moscow Metropolitan. It covered events of 1437-1520. In the same years, the first redaction of Nikon Chronicle. Immediate source of Nikon Chronicle was Ioasaf Chronicle. Nikon Chronicle was the largest Rus' Chronicle. Voskresenskaya (\\"Resurrection\\") Chronicle was another extensive chronicle, it was made between 1542-1544. In the second half of the 1550s, in the reign of Ivan the Terrible, initial redaction of Nikon Chronicle was united with passages from Voskresenskaya Chronicle and Chronicler of the Beginning of Tsardom - chronicle of events of 1533-1552, i.e. the beginning of Ivan's reign (as grand prince, and since 1547 as tsar). In 1568‚Äî1576, also in the reign of Ivan the Terrible, multivolume Illustrated Chronicle Svod. This svods was the last All-Rus' Chronicles, they give place to another form of historiographical texts ‚Äî chronographs.

Discovery and designation The skeleton of a new oviraptorid Huanansaurus ganzhouensis was uncovered during the construction of the Ganzhou railway station in Jiangxi province, China. Front parts of the holotype In 2015, L√º Junchang, Pu Hanyong, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Xu Li, Chang Huali, Shang Yuhua, Liu Di, Lee Yuong-Nam, Martin Kundr√°t and Shen Caizhi named and described the type species Huanansaurus ganzhouensis. The generic name is derived from Huanan, \\"Southern China\\". The specific name refers to the provenance from Ganzhou. Huanansaurus was one of eighteen dinosaur taxa from 2015 to be described in open access or free-to-read journals. The holotype, HGM41HIII-0443, was found in a layer of the Nanxiong Formation dating from the Campanian - Maastrichtian. It consists of a partially articulated, incomplete skeleton which includes a nearly complete skull and lower jaws, the first seven neck vertebrae, a humerus, ulna, radius and hand of the right arm, the left hand, the lower part of the right thighbone, the upper part of the right shinbone, and the distal parts of the right foot. The specimen is part of the collection of the Henan Geological Museum at Zhengzhou. Description Illustration of the head. Life restoration Some unique traits of Huanansaurus have been established. Several of these are autapomorphies. Of the quadrate bone the lower condyles are positioned behind the upper head. The transverse nuchal crest on the rear skull roof is not very prominent. In the lower jaw the angular bone forms a major part of the lower rim of the outer side opening. The front point of the lower jaw is obliquely protruding to above under an angle of less than 45¬∞ with the symphysis, the fused point of the lower jaws. The shelf formed by the symphysis is moderately large, equal to about a fifth to a fourth of the total jaw length. The dentary bone is pneumatised. The lower rear branch of the dentary is twisted, causing its outer side to be somewhat directed to below. The first metacarpal is long and slender with its transverse width equal to a fifth of its length. The hand claws have prominent lips on their upper rears. In addition, a unique combination of in themselves not unique traits is present. The temporal opening on the skull roof is round and much smaller than the temporal opening of the skull side. The rear branch of the praemaxilla touches the lacrimal bone and features a prominent opening at this point, on the rear underside. The upper rear branch of the dentary covers the outer side opening of the lower jaw and has a concave lower rim. Huanansaurus was, within the Oviraptoridae, placed in the Oviraptorinae, as a sister species of Citipati. Below is a cladogram of Oviraptoridae based on the phylogenetic analysis of L√º et al. (2017).

This includes officers of the Ministry of Transport as well as officers of local authorities. Eligible personnel must have been serving on or after 1 January 1987 but before 1 July 1992. The medal recognises those who have completed 14 years of continuous service. Criteria The New Zealand Traffic Service Medal could be awarded to Ministry of Transport Traffic Officers or Road Traffic Instructors as well as traffic officers of the various local authorities, so long as their duties were similar to Ministry of Transport personnel. Service must have been before 1 July 1992 and only those officers who were serving on or after 1 January 1987 were eligible for the medal. Traffic Officers who had previously served in the New Zealand Police could count up to seven years of service toward the award of the Traffic Service Medal, so long as that service had not been recognized by the award of the New Zealand Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal or a clasp for the medal, and the period between the service had not been more than 28 days. Clasps were awarded to the New Zealand Traffic Service Medal for additional 7-year periods of qualifying service. The Ministry of Transport division that enforced traffic laws, along with its officers, was merged into the New Zealand Police in 1992. Since that time, the New Zealand Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal is awarded to Traffic Officers who meet the medal's criteria. Service as a Ministry of Transport Traffic Officer may be counted toward the 14 years of service, so long as the service is not interrupted by more than 28 days and the period of service was not recognized by the award of the New Zealand Traffic Service Medal. Appearance The medal is circular and made of silver metal. It is in diameter. On the obverse is the crowned effigy of the Sovereign.

Early life Leslie Donovan Gibson was born and educated in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1926 he was awarded the John Christie Art Scholarship to Armstrong College, Durham University, taking the education drawing certificate in 1928, the Diploma BA in Fine Art, English and French in 1929 and the Painting Certificate in 1930. He was awarded a Royal Exhibition, studying in the School of Painting at the Royal College of Art from 1930 to 1934.  Career  From 1936 to 1938 he was appointed as the Board of Education Visitor to Art Schools in Germany and Italy. During the 1930s he travelled extensively in Europe, visiting and painting in France, Belgium, Spain, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Greece. In the 1930s he painted from London Studios at Trafalgar Square, Chelsea and Camden Town. In 1940 he worked from Rydal in Westmorland before returning to Kensington, London in 1945. In 1950 he established the Stapleford Studio, near Salisbury, painting extensively in the West Country until his death in 1969. Gibson was a versatile artist, working in a variety of media. Chiefly a landscape painter, portraits and still life were among his subjects. The production of drawings, not merely for working purposes but as a visual record of the artist's experience, carefully outlined in pen and ink, the surfaces freely indicated with wash laid on richer layers predominating over pen lines, are sure and sensitive. His etchings, dry points and lithographs show a fine continuity and chiaroscuro.Angel Gallery Exhibitions From the 1930s onwards, Gibson exhibited work at the Royal Scottish Academy, the National Gallery of Canada and at many group exhibitions.

Early life and education Dawson-Walker was born on 20 December 1868 to Richard Felvus Walker. His family were Wesleyan Methodists and he was brought up in this denomination of Christianity. He was educated at Bradford Grammar School, an independent school in Bradford, Yorkshire. Having been awarded a scholarship, he studied classics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He was awarded a first class in the Honour Moderations in 1889 and a second class in Literae Humaniores in 1891. He therefore graduated from the University of Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1891. It was during his degree, that he moved from Methodism to Anglicanism. In 1901, he completed a Bachelor of Divinity (BD) degree from Oxford. In 1905, he completed a Doctor of Divinity (DD) degree from Oxford and was awarded a DD ad eundem by Durham University. Career In 1894, Dawson-Walker was ordained in the Church of England at Ripon Cathedral by William Boyd Carpenter, Bishop of Ripon. He served his curacy at Bradford Parish Church in Bradford, Yorkshire. He then joined Durham University as a lecturer in classics. In 1898, he was appointed a tutor in theology. In 1901, he became a chaplain at County Hospital, Durham and censor of St Cuthbert's Society, Durham. In 1909, he was appointed Examining Chaplain for ordination candidates in the Diocese of Durham. From 1910 to 1919, he was Professor of Biblical Exegesis at Durham University. From 1911 to 1919, he was additionally Principal of St John's College, Durham. In 1918, he became chaplain to the Corporation of Durham. He maintained a personal interest in the development of his students during and after his time as principal. In 1919, he was appointed Van Mildert Professor of Divinity at Durham University and a Canon Residentiary of Durham Cathedral. These two appointments and his chaplaincy of the Corporation of Durham, meant that he crossed community boundaries and connected town, gown and the clergy. Personal life Dawson-Walker fell within the Evangelical tradition of the Anglican church. In 1899, he married Mary Maud Jane Featherston. Together, they had three sons.

She was also a 2005 journalism fellow at the University of Maryland in their child and family policy program. Guernsey has also served on various committees during her career, including the Education & Youth Development subcommittee of the Advisory Committee on Public Issues for the Ad Council. Education and personal life Guernsey was born in Lebanon, New Hampshire but has lived in Virginia for most of her life. She obtained a bachelor's degree in English and a master's degree in English/American Studies from the University of Virginia in 1994. Guernsey has two daughters, Janelle and Gillian, and they live in Alexandria's Del Ray neighborhood. Career Once Guernsey completed her Bachelor's and master's degrees in 1994 from the University of Virginia through their joint BA/MA program, she moved to Alexandria, Virginia and began working as the Associate Editor of The Chronicle of Higher Education. Then, in 1999, she became a reporter for The New York Times where she wrote articles about new technology, science and education. After she left The New York Times in 2002, she began freelancing for a number of major publications and was a contributor to the book Mobile Technology for Children: Designing for Interaction and Learning. This book focused on the impact of mobile technology on children. Guernsey started at New America in 2009 as a senior policy analyst and became the Director of the Early Education Initiative that same year. She became head of the organization's new Learning and Technologies Project in 2013. Her recent research and writing is focused on progress in early education and digital learning technologies. During her time at New America, Guernsey has written four more books. Her 2012 book, Screen Time: How Electronic Media ‚Äì From Baby Videos to Educational Software ‚Äì Affects Your Young Child, focuses on issues related to the influence of television of young children. Through the authorship of this book, Guernsey conducted extensive research, concluding that exposure to television need not be negative for young children when new parents focus on \\"the three C's\\" involved: content, context and the individual child. In 2013, she presented a TEDx talk in Washington, D.C. on the influence of new technologies, like iPads, on early learning. Her latest book, Tap, Click, Read: Growing Readers in a World of Screens, was published in September 2015 and is co-written with Michael H. Levine of the Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop.

It was described as new to science in 1986 by mycologists Roy Watling and Norma M. Gregory. The species name occidentalis is derived from the Latin occidens \\"west\\". The fruit body has a 5.5‚Äì10 cm diameter cap that has a texture reminiscent of suede or chamois and can be sticky/slimy when young. Initially orange- or pinkish- brown, it is subconical with a thickened margin, and flattens with age and fades an ochre colour. Like other boletes, it has tubes under the cap instead of gills. These are white in young specimens maturing to pink. The cylindrical white stipe is 7‚Äì16 cm tall and 1.7‚Äì2.5 cm wide, marked with deep lacunae. The white flesh bruises yellowish and has a bitter taste. The edibility is unknown. The spore print is brown, the spores are cylindrical, 15‚Äì19 x 5‚Äì6.5 Œºm and covered entirely with warty lumps. Austroboletus occidentalis is a component of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests in southwestern Western Australia. It has been found in coastal scrub in southeastern Tasmania. A. occidentalis establishes a new type of plant-fungus symbiosis with jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), which has been described recently. The presence of A. occidentalis is associated with increased growth and nutrient uptake in jarrah seedlings, despite the fact that mycorrhizal structures were not recovered from the roots of the eucalypt (no root colonization). Chemical and genetic analysis of the soil and plants showed that fungal hyphae were nearby the roots and that plants had increased levels of nutrients including phosphorus, nitrogen, sulphur, magnesium, and several trace elements. Furthermore, the 33P uptake study revealed that fungal hyphae do not transfer nutrient directly to plants. Mobilization and solubilization of nutrients from minerals and soil particles could be one of the underlying mechanisms as the concentration of carboxylates in the rhizosphere soil is higher in plants involved in this symbiosis. However, there might be other unknown mechanisms behind the remarkable improvements in plant growth and nutrition.

History  Serpentine Running Club was established after an appeal in the ‚ÄòFun Runner‚Äô column of Running magazine (now Runner‚Äôs World) following the inaugural London Marathon in 1981, calling for volunteers to form a team to run the second London Marathon. About 50 runners responded and arranged to meet by the bridge over the Serpentine on May 30, 1981 at 9.45am. From the original group of 50 runners, 42, including Geoffrey Cannon, went on to complete the 1982 marathon and decided to carry on running afterwards. There was also a clear majority wanting to form their own club, with the Serpentine name emerging after some discussion. By the early Nineties the club was competing in cross-country, track and field and road running, but it almost folded in the late Nineties.

He was a strong believer in the early Gothic architecture style, which he thought as a true French and Christian tradition, and was opposed to the classical Graeco-Roman styles promoted by the academic establishment. Life Basilique Saint-Nicolas de Nantes Early years Jean-Baptiste- Antoine Lassus was born in Paris on 19 March 1807. He studied at the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris, and in 1823 was given drawing lessons by Christophe Civeton. In 1828 he was admitted to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he was a pupil of Louis-Hippolyte Lebas. He left the school in 1830 and joined the architectural studio of Henri Labrouste. Lassus submitted a plan to the Salon in 1833 for rebuilding the Tuileries Palace to return to the original design of Philibert de l'Orme. In 1835 he proposed restoration of the Gothic- style Sainte-Chapelle. He submitted a plan to the Salon in 1836 to restore the refectory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs Priory. Professional career √âglise du Sacr√©-C≈ìur de Moulins Lassus took commissions to design churches and extensions to convents. In 1835 he began to restore Saint-S√©verin, Paris. In 1836 Lassus and F√©lix Duban were given the task of restoring Sainte-Chapelle. He worked on this project for the rest of his life, concentrating on the spire and the decorations of the interior, which he restored to their earlier form. In 1837 he was named architect for the restoration of Saint-S√©verin. In 1839 Lassus and √âtienne-Hippolyte Godde were given the task of restoring Saint- Germain l'Auxerrois. In 1840 Lassus was asked to undertaken construction of the Basilique Saint-Nicolas de Nantes. In 1841 he built the tomb of the Abb√© Charles-Michel de l'√âp√©e in Saint-Roch, Paris. In 1843 Lassus and Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc won the competition for restoration of Notre Dame de Paris against Jean-Charles Danjoy and Jean-Jacques Arveuf. They replaced the old sculpture with new works, often moving the earlier sculptures to museums. Lassus was asked to build the petit s√©minaire on the rue Notre-Dame des champs in 1845. In 1848 he was asked to serve as an expert at the site of Nantes Cathedral, and was appointed diocesan architect of Chartres and Le Mans. Lassus and Louis Gabriel Esmonnot were commissioned to build the Sacr√©-C≈ìur in Moulins in 1849. In 1850 Lassus made the first studies for Saint-Pierre in Dijon. In 1852 he started a project to enlarge Moulins Cathedral. In 1853 he made initial studies for Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Belleville, Paris. In 1855 he was commissioned to build the church in Cusset. Lassus contracted a disease of the liver, which he neglected. He died on 15 July 1857 in Vichy, where he had gone in search of a cure. His funeral was held in Notre-Dame on 20 July 1857. His tomb was designed by Viollet-le-Duc. Style Lassus designed a few secular buildings, where he showed that he could build in fashionable Louis- Philippe or Louis XIII styles as required by his client, or for harmony with the surrounding buildings. However, he mostly worked on Gothic-style religious buildings, notably Saint-Nicolas de Nantes (1840), Sacr√©-Coeur de Moulins (1849), Saint-Pierre de Dijon (1850), Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville (1853) and the √âglise de Cusset (1855). Lassus was critical of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, which would only recognize pagan Greek and Roman architecture, which he saw as foreign imports. He said of Greek architecture that it did not suit the French religion or climate, or even the materials available in France. He strongly favored Gothic architecture, a Christian style that had originated in France. He was a purist, would only use historical building materials and tried to remain true to original concepts. He believed that the buildings of the first Gothic period were rational and functional, the peak of French architecture. Later Gothic had degenerated and Renaissance architecture introduced foreign and pagan influences. He considered that restoration of Gothic buildings must respect their formal and structural authenticity. The principles of the first Gothic period would be the basis for a new 19th century architecture.

I can only do that which involves my hand and my eye directly‚Äîno prints, no lithos, no chemicals, no technicalities‚Äîfrom the brain to the surface, and if the first is out of order than I am in trouble. I am in trouble often.\\" Working in disciplined series, the artist moved fluidly between autobiography and social issues. ‚ÄúI am a painter of content ‚Äì images of women swept into caves of isolation. I paint the story of this condition.‚Äù Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Tepper focused on the body as a leitmotif. In her late work, Tepper developed a bold and graphic visual language. Her large mural-like canvases depict intertwining figures in black and white, creating kaleidoscopic landscapes. In tandem with her private studio practice, Tepper fostered the careers of others. In 1985, she co-founded the East Hampton Center for Contemporary Art (EHCCA), a non- profit exhibition space and resource center, in East Hampton, NY. The ambitious program was modeled after alternative venues such as Artists Space in Manhattan and presented both established and emerging artists. In the six years of operation, EHCCA presented the work of more than 350 artists in 40 solo and group exhibitions. EHCCA was regularly cited by critics for its emphasis on the cutting edge, its dedication to emerging arts, and its sponsorship of site-specific outdoor sculpture projects. Exhibitions at EHCCA were often thematic and included artists from the region as well as New York City and elsewhere. In addition to mounting exhibitions, EHCCA staged special events including premiering performances by Joseph Pintauro; lectures by art critics Robert Storr and Eleanor Heartney; and readings by Kenneth Koch and David Leavitt, among others. The EHCCA board of advisors included Magdelena DaBrowski, B.H. Friedman, Hope Harris, Bill Jensen, Roy Nicholson, Li-Lan, Susana Torruella Leval, Robert Long, Freda Mindlin, Alfonso Ossorio, and Frank Wimberley. Tepper's daughter, Arielle Tepper Madover, is restoring her mother's original East Hampton studio and is in the process of cataloguing her mother's work and archives, as well as loaning works for exhibition to institutions (see Selected Exhibitions). Selected exhibitions In 2015, Tepper's work was selected for inclusion in the exhibition Selfies and Self Portraits of the East End on view at The Museum at Guild Hall in East Hampton, NY (June 20 ‚Äì July 26, 2015). The group exhibition featured six of her self- portraits from the 1970s alongside artists such as Ross Bleckner, Ahn Duong, Eric Fischl, Elizabeth Peyton, Cindy Sherman, Chuck Close, Julian Schnabel, and Billy Sullivan among others. * Susan Tepper and Bianca Beck, Halsey McKay Gallery, East Hampton, NY, July 6 ‚Äì 29, 2019. * Flashpoint: An Intersection of History, Perseverance, and Joy, Chaos Theory, Sag Harbor, NY, July 28 ‚Äì September 2, 2018. * Hog's Curve, Halsey McKay Gallery, East Hampton, NY, April 7 ‚Äì May 12, 2018. * 12th Annual Thanksgiving Collective, Tripoli Gallery, Southampton, NY, November 26, 2016 ‚Äì January 30, 2017. * Susan Tepper: Paintings 1978-1983, Tripoli Gallery, Southampton, NY, August 20 ‚àí October 3, 2016. * Selfies and Portraits of the East End, Guild Hall, East Hampton, NY, June 10 ‚Äì July 26, 2015. * The Human Factor, Painting Space Gallery ‚Äì P.S. 122, New York, 1985. * Tight Spaces / Social Graces, Ashawagh Hall, East Hampton, NY, 1985. * Members‚Äô Exhibition, Guild Hall, East Hampton, NY, 1984. * Urban Tribe ‚Äì Two Painters, Ashawagh Hall, East Hampton, NY, 1984. * Springs Artists Invitation, Ashawagh Hall, East Hampton, NY, 1984. * Susan Tepper: Drawings and Paintings, Panoras Gallery, New York, NY, 1971.

She taught classes for thirty years, and her recipes and techniques were passed on for generations in the cookbooks of one of her students, Eliza Leslie. Goodfellow also ran a renowned bakery and confectionery in Philadelphia during the first fifty years of the 19th century. Personal life Very little is known about Mrs. Goodfellow‚Äôs life. By 1801 she was married and conducting business on Dock Street, Philadelphia, as Elizabeth Pearson, pastry cook. Her daughter, Sarah Anne Pearson Bouvier (1800-1826) had been born the year before. Robert Coane, her second husband, and she had a son Robert Coane (1804-1877) who would become a partner in the store in 1837. Lastly, she married William Goodfellow, a clockmaker, in 1808, but he died ten years later. According to her obituary, Mrs. Elizabeth Goodfellow died on January 5, 1851 at age 83 in Philadelphia, so she was most likely born in 1767. Career For a half-century, her highly successful shop was located on three streets: Dock, South Second and finally Sixth Street, moving further from the Delaware River docks each time. She was well known for her pies and cakes, particularly Lemon Pies, Cocoanut Pies, Spanish Buns and Jumbles (later, recipes for those in particular, labeled with the famous name ‚ÄòMrs. Goodfellow,‚Äô appeared in several cookbooks). Her reputation soon led to her teaching cooking classes, with equally positive results, lasting thirty years. Daughters from wealthy families attended her classes as a part of their education to prepare to enter society. One of her students from a prominent family, Susan Israel Painter (1790-1845), the daughter of Revolutionary War General Joseph Israel from Delaware graduated in 1807, and married four years later. Many of her handwritten recipes were included in the Colonial Receipt Book: Celebrated Old Receipts Used a Century Ago by Mrs Goodfellow‚Äôs Cooking School. Another student, Eliza Leslie (1787-1858), compiled her teacher‚Äôs recipes into the first of many extremely popular cookbooks, Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats in 1828. Leslie took two of Goodfellow's courses sometime after her father died and her mother was forced to manage a succession of boarding houses. As a student, she took many notes, and over the years, friends would ask her for copies. Her brother suggested that she compile some of them into a book so she did not have to copy the recipes each time. As part of her recipe for Goodfellow‚Äôs famous lemon pie, Leslie wrote: \\"A genuine baked lemon pudding (such as was introduced by the justly celebrated Mrs. Goodfellow), and is well known at Philadelphia dinner parties, must have no flour or bread whatever. The mixture only of butter, sugar, and eggs, (with the proper flavoring) and when baked it cuts down smooth and shining, like a nice custard. Made this way, they are among the most delicious of puddings‚Ä¶\\" The recipe used whole eggs in the filling, so it‚Äôs improbable that Goodfellow created the lemon meringue pie - with egg yolk filling and the leftover egg whites whipped for meringue topping. Legacy For years after her death Mrs. Goodfellow would be remembered by her students, their families (\\"many a household, for years after, bore evidence of her skill in teaching\\") and her customers. Months after she died, Mrs. Goodfellow‚Äôs cocoanut pie was vividly recalled by a Philadelphian reporter stationed in Europe. William Henry Fry wrote an article for Sartain‚Äôs Union Magazine (a Philadelphia magazine), about an acrobatic horseman, trained at the riding school of Philadelphia, performing at the Paris Hippodrome in 1851. The rider did seventy consecutive somersaults and other equestrian vaulting marvels. Perhaps nostalgic for a favorite dessert, Fry suggested another Philadelphia school - the Goodfellow cooking school - would do well in Paris, and compared her cocoanut pudding to the best of the extravagant displays by the French chef Fran√ßois Vatel from the 17th century. Although Mrs. Goodfellow never wrote a cookbook, her recipes appeared in a variety of cookbooks, such as one by a Quaker from Philadelphia, Elizabeth Nicholson's What I Know, or, Hints on the Daily Duties of a Housekeeper. That and a second book were published in Philadelphia in 1856, five years after she died. Cookery as it Should be: new manual of the dining room and kitchen, for persons in moderate circumstances was written by a former student, who \\"experimented\\" with the more modern recipes. The same book was published almost a decade later and retitled Mrs. Goodfellow‚Äôs Cookery as it Should be. It was claimed to be written by Mrs. Goodfellow, which it obviously was not. Other cookbooks contained recipes identified with her name. However, it was Eliza Leslie‚Äôs first cookbook, and to a lesser degree her other books, which allowed Mrs. Goodfellow‚Äôs teaching to influence generations of cooks. Mrs. Goodfellow stressed quality ingredients, thus her baked goods \\"were always excellently made, nothing being spared that was good.\\" Leslie followed Goodfellow‚Äôs recipe layout by putting the ingredients first, rather than in the usual paragraph format, in her Seventy five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats.

Known CAPPs include members of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) families. CAPPs are a subset of intracellular serine/threonine phosphatases. Each CAPP consists of a catalytic subunit which confers phosphatase activity and a regulatory subunit which confers substrate specificity. CAPP involvement has been implicated in glycogen metabolism, apoptotic pathways related to cancer and other cellular pathways related to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  Structure   Ceramide-activated PP2A  As a member of the PP2A family, CAPPs can consist of one to three PP2A subunits (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The core enzyme consists of a conserved 34 kilodalton (kDa) catalytic subunit, C, and a conserved 65 kDa scaffold subunit, A, tightly bound to one another (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The scaffold subunit contains 15 tandem HEAT repeats which arrange to form a horseshoe-like structure that confers remarkable conformational flexibility (Groves, Hanlon, Turowski, Hemmings & Barford, 1999). Each repeat contains a pair of highly conserved antiparallel Œ±-helices which form a contiguous ridge (Groves et al., 1999). The catalytic subunit recognizes and associates with the scaffold subunit through this ridge (Groves et al., 1999). Two other regulatory subunit families, the 55 kDa B family and the 61 kDa B' family, can both bind the core enzyme in a mutually exclusive manner (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B' subunit is similar in structure to the scaffold subunit and makes extensive interactions with the scaffold subunit, through a convex surface with eight HEAT repeats, and the catalytic subunit (Janssens & Goris, 2001). A concave, acidic region of the B' subunit is tilted towards the active site of the catalytic subunit in the holoenzyme (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B subunit contains seven WD40 repeats, a Œ≤-hairpin handle and other secondary structures that form a Œ≤-propeller (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The Œ≤-propeller and Œ≤-hairpin handle interact with HEAT repeats three to seven and one to two on the scaffold subunit, respectively (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B subunit has little interaction with the catalytic subunit but also contains an acidic substrate binding site positioned near the active site of the catalytic subunit (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B subunits share no sequence identity with B' subunits (Janssens & Goris, 2001). CAPPs can be present as the core dimeric enzyme of AC or a trimeric holoenzyme of ABC or AB‚ÄôC (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Ceramide has also been shown to activate the C subunit alone (Janssens & Goris, 2001). There are two isoforms, Œ± and Œ≤, of the C and A subunits (Janssens & Goris, 2001). There are four isoforms, Œ±, Œ≤ Œ≥ and Œ¥, of the B subunit and five isoforms Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥, and …õ of the B' subunit (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The combinations of these isoforms give a possibility of 40 distinct CAPPs.  Ceramide-activated PP1  Long-chain ceramides have also been shown to activate members of the PP1 family (Chalfant et al., 1999). The CAPPs in this family are composed of a catalytic subunit that can associate with one of over a dozen regulatory subunits (Egloff et al., 1997). The regulatory subunits interact with the catalytic subunit through a conserved RVXF motif (Egloff et al., 1997). When this binding site is deleted from regulatory proteins, they lose the ability to associate with the catalytic subunit (Egloff et al., 1997). There is only one recognition site on the catalytic subunit, making the association of a regulatory subunit mutually exclusive (Egloff et al., 1997). The catalytic subunit of ceramide- activated PP1 is a single-domain protein consisting of a central Œ≤-sandwich, of two mixed Œ≤-sheets, with seven Œ±-helices surrounding the sandwich on one side and a sub-domain consisting of three Œ±-helices and a Œ≤-sheet on the opposite side (Egloff et al., 1997). Three loops that connect Œ≤-sheets with Œ±-helices in the top Œ≤-sandwich strand form a Œ≤-Œ±-Œ≤-Œ±-Œ≤ motif that interacts with loops form the opposite Œ≤-sandwich sheet to provide the catalytic residues (Egloff et al., 1997).  Activators and inhibitors  In general, CAPP expression is controlled by an autoregulatory translational mechanism and with the developmental regulation of CAPP subunits (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Ceramide is the defining activator of CAPP while other activators include theophylline and sodium selenate. Mechanisms for their modes of activation are unknown and more research is needed to explore and identify new CAPP activators. I1PP2A and I2PP2A inhibit all possible forms of CAPP by associating with the catalytic subunit using their C-terminal domains (Li, Makkinje, & Damuni, 1996). Both inhibitors are potent and non-competitive (Li et al., 1996). It is also suggested that both inhibitors are conserved between mice and humans and that both are also about the same mass (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Okadaic acid is commonly used for producing cellular models without CAPP activity (Hannun, 1996).  I2PP2A  I2PP2A does not inhibit CAPP in vitro but has been proven to inhibit CAPP in vivo (Janssens & Goris, 2001). I2PP2A mainly acts as an inhibitor by binding to the catalytic subunit, causing a conformational change, and rendering it non-functional (Janssens & Goris, 2001). In the presence of physiological Mn2+ concentrations, I2PP2A can associate with and stimulate the activity of PP1 but Mn2+ does not seem to affect the inhibition of PP2A through I2PP2A, in vitro (Janssens & Goris, 2001). I2PP2A has also been identified as a truncated SET protein (Janssens & Goris, 2001). SET proteins, such as I2PP2A have been shown to associate with nucleoporins to form fusion proteins that can inhibit the activity of ceramide-activated PP2A and contribute to leukaemia pathogenesis (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Studies also show that leukemic fusion proteins can associate with SET and co-immunopreciptate with CAPP, suggesting that the inhibitory role of I2PP2A may be involved in regulating cell growth in leukemia (Zhu et al., 2006).  I1PP2A  I1PP2A is a CAPP inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo and has been identified as a PHAP-1 protein (Li et al., 1996). I1PP2A has a highly acidic C-terminal tail and the N-terminus is leucine/isoleucine rich (Li et al., 1996). In the presence of physiological conditions of Mn2+, I1PP2A can also associate with and stimulate the activity of PP1 but Mn2+ also does not affect the inhibition of PP2A through I1PP2A, in vitro (Janssens & Goris, 2001). When I1PP2A is over expressed in mice, researchers observe a reduction in neurite length, indicating that CAPP may be involved in supporting neurite growth (Mutz et al., 2006). Increased levels of I1PP2A are associated with the regulation of tau proteins, suggesting that CAPP may play a role in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (Wang et al., 2015).  Okadaic acid  Okadaic acid is a complex fatty acid polyether and a potent CAPP inhibitor (Hannun, 1996). Okadaic acid is mainly used as a research tool to characterize serine/threonine phosphatases, such as CAPP, through inhibition (Hannun, 1996).  Ceramide  Ceramide is a lipid secondary messenger that has been linked to aspects of the cellular stress response (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Products of sphingomyelin metabolism, activated by stress, seem to react with sphingolipids to liberate ceramide (Dobrowsky, R.T. 1992). The ceramide from this cycle can activate CAPP which then participates in various pathways (Dobrowsky, R.T. 1992).  Sodium selenate  How sodium selenate specifically activates ceramide-activated PP2A has not been well studied. Sodium selenate increases PP2A activity which decreases tau hyperphosphorylation, indicating that CAPPs may be manipulated to affect brain function (Tan et al., 2016). In addition, an increase in PP2A induced by sodium selenate also inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway, implying that sodium selenate can induce changes in cell morphology and motility (Tsukamoto, Hama, Kogure, & Tsuchiya, 2013). AKT inhibition caused by sodium selenate seems to be physiologically effective at low concentrations (Tsukamoto et al., 2013).  Theophylline  Only one study, as of yet, has identified theophylline as an activator of ceramide-activated PP2A. The study indicates PP2A activation with theophylline as a method of controlling respiratory inflammation in human airway smooth muscle cells, in vitro (Patel et al., 2016).  Cellular reaction pathways   PP1 pathway  Stimulation of mammalian cells with TNFŒ± increases intracellular C6 ceramide production which then increases PP1 activity (Ghosh et al., 2007). It was previously thought that insulin was the primary stimulant of the PP1 pathway (Ghosh et al., 2007). It has now been shown that TNFŒ±-mediated ceramide production increases the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of PP1 while insulin does not, indicating a ceramide- specific response (Ghosh et al., 2007). Inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis seem to prevent PP1 activation (Ghosh et al., 2007). The effects of ceramide on insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase kinase 3Œ≤ phosphorylation were abolished with PP1 inhibitors, further implicating that TNFŒ± mediates its effects through a ceramide-activated PP1 which blocks insulin phosphorylation cascades involved in glycogen metabolism (Ghosh et al., 2007).  PP2A pathway  The generation of ceramide can cause down-regulation of the c-myc gene, which can trigger a cellular cascade resulting in cell death through apoptotic mechanisms (Wolff et al., 1994). In leukemia cell lines, CAPP is actively brought into cells for downstream regulation of the c-myc gene through ceramide-induced control (Wolff et al., 1994). Partial purification of a ceramide-activated PP2A indicated an inherent ability to dephosphorylate the antiapoptotic protein c-jun in vitro, suggesting that it could be a direct substrate for ceramide-activated PP2A (Ruvolo et al., 1999). Ceramide specifically activates a mitochondrial PP2A which results in the prompt dephosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl2 (Ruvolo et al., 1999). Bcl2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that, when inactivated, can cause the cell to conduct apoptosis (Ruvolo et al., 1999). Regulation of Bcl2 is dependent upon the phosphorylation status of Ser70 (Janssens & Goris, 2001). This phosphorylated residue is directly responsible for the apoptotic mechanism of the protein and a dephosphorylation at this site with a CAPP will inhibit its activity (Janssens and Goris, 2001). Induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cells increases PP2A activity due to the activation of caspase-3, and the subsequent cleavage of the scaffold subunit which provided the enzyme with stability (Janssens & Goris, 2001). This increased activity can be observed with the decreased phosphorylation of MAPK pathway substrates (Janssens & Goris, 2001). E4orf4, an adenovirus protein that has been shown to induce apoptosis in transformed cells, interacts with ceramide-activated PP2A to have this effect (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Interaction can take place on either a BŒ± or B' regulatory subunit but only interaction with a BŒ± subunit is sufficient for the induction of apoptosis in cells transformed with adenovirus (Janssens & Goris, 2001).  Major pathological implications   Alzheimer‚Äôs disease  When tau proteins become hyperphosphorylated they dissociate from the microtubules to which they provide stability and are thought to polymerize into neurofibrillary tangles in the brain and contribute to the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B subunit of a CAPP confers the ability to dephosphorylate hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Hyperphosphorylated tau can interact with the acidic face of the B subunit and allow the catalytic subunit to dephosphorylate the protein (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Treatment of neuronal cells with okadaic acid has been shown to cause tau neurofibrillary tangles, indicating that disruptions of the interaction between CAPP, tau and microtubules can lead to the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (Janssens & Goris, 2001).  Cancer  CAPP was first linked to carcinogenesis when it was noticed that okadaic acid acted as a tumor promoter and it was postulated that its inhibition of CAPP may confer this property (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The Œ± and Œ≤ isoforms of the scaffold subunit of CAPP have been identified as tumor suppressor genes in skin, lung, breast and colon-derived cell lines (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B' regulatory subunit of CAPP also appears to be overexpressed in malignant melanoma, as compared to regular epidermal cells (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B' subunit seems to interact specifically with and dephosphorylate paxillin in the focal adhesions of cancer cells (Janssens & Goris, 2001). When truncated B' Œ≥ subunits were expressed in melanoma cells, an increased rate of metastasis was observed (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The increased cell migration appears to be related to the increased phosphorylation of paxillin when dysfunctional B' Œ≥ subunits are expressed (Janssens & Goris, 2001). In most primary human malignancies telomerase is elevated, suggesting that telomerase is required for continuous cell division (Janssens & Goris, 2001). It has been shown that ceramide treatment can significantly reduce telomerase production in human lung carcinomas, indicating that CAPPs may be involved in counteracting uncontrolled cell growth (Ogretmen et al., 2001).

The house and studio were home to American Abstract Artists George L.K. Morris and Suzy Frelinghuysen. The studio was built in Bauhaus style in 1930 by Morris and his friend George Sanderson. The house was added in 1941, designed by John Butler Swann. The house and studio were entered onto the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.. The house contains furnishings and decorations unchanged since the couple's lifetime. The art collection includes cubist frescoes and paintings by Morris and Frelinghuysen, as well as works by Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Georges Braque, Joan Miro and Henri Matisse. Property history The property was part of a larger agricultural property until 1885, when it was developed as a country estate called Brookhurst by William Bainbridge Shattuck of New York City. Shattuck hired architect James Renwick Jr., whose well-known commissions include the Smithsonian Castle in Washington, D.C. The main house burned down in 1908, leaving only a number of Renwick-designed outbuildings. The estate was then purchased by Newbold Morris (the son of Augustus Newbold Morris), who hired Francis L. V. Hoppin and Terence Koen (who had also done work on Edith Wharton's The Mount) to design a grand Colonial Revival mansion house. One of the outbuildings from this period was converted into a guesthouse by Frelinghuysen and Morris. Upon the death of Helen Morris in 1956, the estate was divided into three portions. The westernmost element, which includes some of the Brookhurst outbuildings, was inherited by George Morris. He had hired George Sanderson, a college classmate, to design the Modernist studio which was completed in 1930, taking inspiration from the groundbreaking work of Le Corbusier. The studio is one of the oldest Modernist buildings in the state. The house was added in 1941, after Morris and Frelinghuysen married, as an adjunct to the studio space, and is considered an early example of Mid-Century Modern architecture. Morris died in 1975, and Frelinghuysen in 1988. After her death, a non-profit foundation was established to preserve the property as a museum.

The location of the castle is near the village of Lombron, in the Department of Sarthe. Middle Ages The Seigneurie or Ch√¢tellenie or Fief of Launay makes casual appearance in documents dating to the early 11th century. Reference to the current Ch√¢teau de Launay first appears in the late 14th century in the form of transfer documents. The history of Launay, at one time one of the most powerful seigneuries in western France, is steeped in the events of the last 600 years. The early history is dependent on archival material which is incomplete. Seigneur (lord) Robin de Launay was the most powerful of the 22 vassals to the Count of Bresteau whose lands spanned seven parishes in western France. Much of the count's holdings were lost in the Hundred Years War. The lands and castle of Launay survived the wars though Robin de Launay did not. In 1404 the daughter of Robin de Launay inherited the properties and the associated title. Soon thereafter she married Pierre de Milon, Seigneur de Mortrie and Lavigne, the latter being a royal vassalage. In 1455 the Seigneurie of Launay passed to Jehan de Bernay who, like Pierre de Milon, was Seneschal to Montfort.Archives National de France RS 385 Renaissance Letters from 1509, 1510, and 1527 make reference to Pierre de Bernay (likely the son of Jehan) as Seigneur de Launay. A rather melodramatic history involving Pierre survives in several sources. In 1523 de Bernay hid Gabrielle d‚Äô Harcourt (age 14 years) at Launay on behalf of his friend Comte (count) Charles de Coesmes, Seigneur de Luc√©.Charles de Coesmes- Chevalier sous Louis XII et Francois I- Baron de Luce 1485-1543, Amalthee 21 Sept 2006 Charles was widowed when Gabrielle's older sister, his first wife, died a few months earlier. According to several accounts, Gabrielle was more than willing to marry Charles but her mother Anne de St. Germain was strongly opposed. Ultimately, Gabrielle and Charles married in a clandestine ceremony near Ch√¢teau de Launay on 28 December 1523. Anne de St. Germain pursued Charles de Coesmes and Pierre de Bernay relentlessly. She succeeded in obtaining a royal decree (Fran√ßois I) condemning both men to public decapitation. It was specified that their corpses should remain on display in front of the gates to Anne's castle (Ch√¢teau de Bonn√©table). Both men, along with Gabrielle and a few attendants fled and remained on the move for the next year and a half. Taking advantage of the imprisonment of Fran√ßois I, following his defeat at the Battle of Paire, Charles appealed to the Duchess of Angoul√™me. Acting on behalf of Fran√ßois I, the duchess granted a pardon to Charles. No mention was made of Pierre, however. Charles and Gabrielle were able to return to the region around Bonn√©table. They eventually became favorites of Fran√ßois and his court. Charles' Ch√¢tellenie of Luc√© was eventually elevated to a barony. The couple divided their time between Bonn√©table and the royal court in Paris. Charles died at age 54 in 1543; Gabrielle remarried 13 months later. Her second marriage (Seigneur de Pescheray) was a short one. She died in 1546 at age 36. To a degree Pierre remained a fugitive. Records reveal that he was arrested on 6 October 1525. The death sentence, still in place, was not carried out but he was forced to pay a heavy fine in 1526. Beyond this all that is known of Pierre de Bernay is that he had a son, Jehan de Bernay, who inherited the Seigneurie de Launay. In 1551 the Seigneurie de Launay passed from the de Bernay family to the wealthy du Gronchay family. For the first time in its history, the transfer of the chateau, its lands and title was through sale rather than inheritance or marriage. Over the next three generations, seven members of the du Gronchay clan held the title and property at one time or another. In 1607 the surviving children of J√©r√¥me de Gronchay, Jacquine (b. 1578) and Catherine (b. 1579), Dames de Lari√®res and Launay inherited. When Jacquine married Jehan de Breton, Seigneur de la Calabriere, a few months later, Jehan became Seigneur de Launay, as well as Vaibesnard and Pouvray. Jehan died sometime before 1640, Jacquine then regained the position of Dame de Launay as well as the other seigneuries that had been controlled by her husband. In 1643 Robert le Balleur, son of Catherine du Gronchet and her husband Jean le Balleur, acquired Launay, Jacquine having died without heirs. According to the Charter of Launay, on 23 April 1650, Robert le Balleur, knight, Seigneur de Landres, Knight of the Royal Order, Chamberlain to the King, Sherif of Perche, Seigneur de Launay, Vaibesnard, and Pouvray, made an oath of filet to the Count of Bresteau. The charter shows that the oath was repeated in 1654. The oath was taken up by Catherine le Balleur in 1666 and again in 1671, having inherited from her husband, Robert. Catherine's son, Henri, signed the oath in 1683. In 1694 Henri le Balleur, in the presence of Le Mans notaries, Victor Siger and Guillaume Foin, sold to Monsieur and Madame Andr√© Guyonneau, king's councillor and lieutenant, Seneschal of Le Mans, The sale was transacted at a price of 150,479 livres. The new Seigneur de Launay, Andr√© Guyonneau, was king's lieutenant, magistrate of Le Mans and advisor to the king.L'Edict de 1696, Armorial G√©n√©ral de France In 1692 he married the very wealthy Fran√ßoise Th√©r√®se Hoyau. Their son, Fran√ßois Guyonneau, born in 1696, took charge of Andr√©'s properties on his death in 1722. Little is known of Fran√ßois; he died in 1760 leaving behind two children, Anne Th√©r√®se and Fran√ßois Andr√©. Anne Th√©r√®se was born 25 August 1728. She was married to the Seigneur de Gigny in 1747. When he died in 1758 she was left with quite a fortune. Contemporaries described her subsequent life as frivolous in the extreme. She managed to spend the entire fortune before dying in poverty and obscurity in 1770.Archive Historique du Maine, BiblioBazaar, Nov 2009. French Revolution and 19th century Her brother, Fran√ßois Andr√© Guyonneau, was the first to style himself as Sieur de Grandmaison. He pursued a military career, first as a lieutenant in the \\"Iron Regiment\\", later as Captain of the Queen's household. He died in January 1794. The Lombron Parish registry recorded that on Sunday, 18 September 1762 much of the seigneurial Grandmaison was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt and somewhat enlarged over the next two years. In another set back many of the Launay properties were confiscated by the Republicans (French Revolution) in June 1791. Three children were born to Andr√© Guyonneau and his wife, Anne Gabrielle Harrison d‚Äô Auvours. Two boys died as young children. A daughter, Anne Fran√ßoise, was born 1 December 1772. She married Jacques Louis Belin de B√©ru (twice her age at the time of their wedding in January 1796). Despite the seizure of property by the Republic, Anne was quite wealthy at the time of her marriage; her most valuable asset was the Domaine of Grandmaison.Launay alias La Grandmaison, Oeuvre de Pierre Dufour, Instituteur Public, Lombron 1960 Louis was imprisoned in Paris during the Terror. He would have been executed if not for the timely fall from power of Robespierre. Louis went on to have a long and successful career in the National Assembly. He died at age 81 in 1828; Anne died 14 September 1840. At the time of her death the Domaine de Grandmaison included 125 ha. The holdings included the chateau as well as named properties: la Fureti√®re, la Chalopini√®re, les Petits and Grand Gu√©raule and le Degoutier. Anne and Jacques de Grandmaison had no children. Thus, after eight centuries, the powerful Domaine de Launay was poised to be dismembered. The greater part of the domaine, including the chateau and 101 ha of land were acquired (partly through inheritance, partly through purchase) by the widow, Madame Duqu√© of LeMans. Over the remainder of the 19th century ownership of the ch√¢teau changed hands four more times. Much of the land was sold off. At its nadir Grandmaison/ Launay included only 3.4 ha of land. World War II and 20th century In 1912 the property was purchased by the wealthy Rolot family of Paris. It became the principal residence of the son, Jacques Rolot, having earlier served the small family as a summer home. Jaques Rolot fled with his family in advance of the invading Germans in 1940. The ch√¢teau was occupied by the Germans throughout most of the war, serving as a command center (9th Panzer Division) and quarters for German officers. Early on, under the direction of the propaganda officer assigned to the unit most of the extensive library was burned. Fortunately, many of the unique historical documents in the library were among the few volumes spared. On 9 August 1944 the ch√¢teau and surrounding regions were liberated by the U.S. 5th Armored Division and the 79th Infantry Division.Sarthe, ao√ªt 1944 Histoire d'une Lib√©ration, Fabrice Avoie, 2009. ASIN B005MIY9P2 Unfortunately the retreating Germans took time to vandalize the ch√¢teau extensively. Following the war, Jacques returned to Lombron but did not resume residence at the ch√¢teau. He did oversee considerable repair and restoration. Through the 1950s the ch√¢teau and its meager remaining land changed hands numerous times. Ultimately it was acquired by an unremarkable local who lived there with his family for a decade. To the previous insults of fire, political confiscation, war and vandalism was now added the shameless pillage and sale of historic fixtures. Arguably Launay was at its historic ebb when it was sold to Marcel-Pierre Cl√©ach and his wife in 1970. Recent history Monsieur Cl√©ach was early in his political career in 1970. He would go on to become one of the longest serving and most powerful French Senators of the Fifth Republic. He also began the process of restoring Launay to something of its noble past. He extensively repaired and upgraded the interior and also undertook ambitious renovations of the west wing of the ch√¢teau. He began the process of reversing the damage done during and subsequent to the war, a project which continues to the present. In 1979 Cl√©ach, having acquired the large Ch√¢teau de Lorresse sold Launay to Jacques Maes. Maes continued with improvements to the buildings and repurchased some of the former land holdings, bringing the current expanse to 38 acres. In 2000 Maes sold Launay with its expanded property to David and Marie-Laure MacKee (Baron and Baronne de Monasterevan) who have continued the restoration and conservation efforts.

Retrieved on 25 March 2014.  Gameplay  Tabletop Simulator is a player-driven physics sandbox, without set victory or failure conditions. After selecting a table to play on, players interact with the game by spawning and moving virtual pieces, which are subject to a physics simulation. Online multiplayer is supported with a maximum of ten players. Aside from spawning and moving pieces, the game includes mechanics to assist with common styles of board game play, such as automatic dice rolling and hiding players' pieces from one another; other mechanics aid in administrating a game, for example saving the state of the board or undoing moves. Several games are included, including chess, checkers and poker. Tables and pieces can be mixed and customized to create new games, which can then be saved to share and play with others. The game allows images and models to be imported to create entirely new pieces and tables, allowing for the recreation of most real-world board games. Over three-thousand games and custom assets are shared on the game's Steam Workshop; while there is original content, a notable number of these shared items are adaptations of existing games, including unlicensed derivatives of copyrighted works. Berserk Games has also worked with a number of game publishers to offer officially licensed Tabletop Simulator versions of their games as downloadable content, such as Cosmic Encounter.  Development  Tabletop Simulator was developed by Berserk Games, a studio consisting of Jason Henry and Kimiko. Before forming Berserk Games, Henry attended college focusing on engineering, while working on game mods in his spare time, including the popular Mana Warfare mod for Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Kimiko had been a community moderator for Chivalry and later a member of Torn Banner Studios. In an interview with Gamasutra the pair described the game Desperate Gods as being an inspiration, though they wanted to expand the \\"free-form shared board game\\" concept to cover all tabletop games.

Hoffy (1796‚Äì1872) was a mid 19th century American lithographer and botanical illustrator who founded the first American periodical devoted solely to fruit cultivation. Biography Siamese twins Chang and Eng, promotional lithograph by Alfred Hoffy c.1836‚Äì37. Alfred Hoffy was born in London, England, in 1796. As a young man he joined the British Army and rose to the rank of major. He fought in the Battle of Waterloo, during which he served as an aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington, and later commanded his own regiment. In 1830, Hoffy left the army and emigrated to the United States, landing in New York, where he went into business with the British lithographer J.T. Bowen. In 1837, he created a well-known lithographic portrait of the conjoined twins Chang and Eng Bunker. Around 1838, Bowen and Hoffy moved their lithography business to Philadelphia, where Hoffy created lithographic illustrations for the local newspaper, The North American. His subjects ranged from news events‚Äîthe arrival of an Egyptian sarcophagus in Philadelphia; the 1835 Great Fire of New York‚Äîto portraits drawn from daguerreotypes of such well-known people as General Santa Anna and financier Cyrus West Field. He also produced many of the plates for the fashion periodical U.S. Military Magazine published by Duval and Huddy between 1839 and 1842 and contributed lithographic plates to Thomas McKenney and James Hall's History of the Indian Tribes of North America. U.S. Vice-President George Mifflin Dallas in a lithography by Alfred Hoffy after a daguerreotype by M.A. Root. In Philadelphia, Hoffy married Emma Jane Patterson, with whom he had six daughters and two sons. Hoffy was very interested in fruit production in America, and in the early 1840s, he founded a periodical on American fruit with color plates that he intended would match the quality of those found in European journals. Hoffy's Orchardist's Companion: A Quarterly Journal, Devoted to the History, Character, Properties, Modes of Cultivation, and All Other Matters Appertaining to the Fruits of the United States was praised in the local and national press for its usefulness and especially for the \\"superb colored engravings of fruits\\". Despite this, just 5 issues were published over two years (1841‚Äì43) before Hoffy had to stop because production proved to be too expensive and he could not cover his costs. Hoffy's Orchardist's Companion was the first American periodical devoted solely to fruit cultivation. Lithograph of Howell pear by Alfred A. Hoffy, from Hoffy's North American Pomologist, 1860. Following this, Hoffy began work with the physician and amateur pomologist William D. Brinckl√© on a new series of publications on native North American fruits to be published under the general title North American Pomologist. Individual volumes would be edited by Brinckl√© (who was for many years the vice-president of the Philadelphia Horticultural Society) and would consist of 36 pages of information on different kinds of fruit illustrated with 10 color plates. The illustrations were produced as stone lithographs drawn by Hoffy (signed \\"From Nature by A. Hoffy\\") and colored under his direction. The fruit is usually shown in a full-color side view, sometimes accompanied by a simple black outline of the fruit's profile. Hoffy and Brinckl√© felt this series was needed because of \\"repeated disappointments which have attended the cultivation of Foreign Fruits in this country\\" and also to clear up increasing confusion over common fruit names. The entire series was published together in 1860 in a single volume as Hoffy's North American Pomologist. In the late 1860s, Hoffy moved his family to Brooklyn, New York, where he died on March 10, 1872. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery. References Lithograph of Col. Wilder raspberry by Alfred A.

The band was formed in 2010 by singer-guitarist Nick Van Delft and Long Distance Calling drummer Janosch Rathmer. Stephan Gall and Robert Kahr joined shortly after to complete the line-up before Ruben Claro replaced Kahr in 2012. The band are heavily influenced by rock and blues music from the 1970s and it adds to the theme and style of their own music. As of 2016, they have made four studio albums. History Founding and A Bit Of Devil (2010 to 2012) Lead guitarist and vocalist Nick van Delft Guitarist Stephan Gall and drummer Janosch Rathmer had previously spent eight years with melodic death metal band Misery Speaks. Following the break-up of the band in 2010, Gall and Rathmer still wanted to pursue their music careers. Rathmer met Nick Van Delft that same year and after several weeks of jamming, they started planning to create a new band. Van Delft wanted the band to be a trio before Rathmer persuaded him to be in a band with a second guitar. Gall was invited by Rathmer to join the band with Robert Kahr joining around the same time on bass and keyboards. Rathmer choose the band name after the astrological term. In April 2011, the band played their first gigs before their debut record was released- a self-titled EP. Shortly afterwards, Gall and Rathmer founded their own record label named Honest Hound Records. The band's debut studio album A Bit Of Devil was released on 25 May 2012 and the band toured in autumn 2012 with bands such as The Sword and Spiritual Beggars. A Hiding Place and Sonic Child (2013 to 2014) Bassist, keyboardist and backing vocalist Ruben Claro When Robert Kahr left the band in 2012, Ruben Claro replaced him playing the same instruments and adding backing vocals to the band. Zodiac received a deal from Napalm Records in July 2013 before the release of the second studio album A Hiding Place in October the same year. As well as the debut album, A Hiding Place was also released under Prosthetic Records in the US. The album includes a cover of Cortez The Killer by Neil Young. The first and second tracks of the album Downtown and Free were both released with music videos that can be found on YouTube as well as a lyric video for the fifth track Moonshine. Downtown was also released as the only single of the album. In late 2013, the band had to cancel a tour supporting stoner rock band Monster Magnet after their visas were denied. Instead, Zodiac went on a small European tour with Orchid and Blues Pills and began preparations for their third studio album. In March 2014, the band supported acts Audrey Horne and Grand Magus in Scandinavia before recording for their next album two months later. The album Sonic Child was released on 19 September 2014 with ten tracks, two bonus tracks and four live performances. Sonic Child debuted at number 47 on the German album charts. Road Tapes Vol. 1 (2014‚Äìpresent) In autumn 2014, Zodiac headlined for the first time on tour in Germany. The band used 17 concerts during the tour to record for the band's first live album Road Tapes Vol. 1. The album was released on 17 April 2015 and included songs performed live from their previous three studio albums. In June 2015, the band posted a link to their music video for A Bit Of Devil while commenting that songwriting had begun for their fourth studio album. Style Zodiac's style is a mix of hard rock, blues rock and classic rock from the 1970s. Drummer Janosch Rathmer labelled Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Thin Lizzy, Stevie Ray Vaughan, ZZ Top and Joe Bonamassa as influences.

It was first broadcast on China Television in Taiwan in August 2005. In mainland China it was first broadcast on CCTV-8 in 2006. The title is directly taken from a poem by Li Yu, the protagonist of the drama. Essentially a soap opera, many relationships are fictionalized, but recorded historical events including the Conquest of Southern Tang by Song are followed relatively faithfully. Over 60 historical characters appear in this series, including 9 monarchs of 5 different states (Later Han, Later Zhou, Later Shu, Song dynasty and Southern Tang). Plot Set in the 10th century, the story revolves around two monarchs: Zhao Kuangyin, the first ruler of the Song dynasty, and Li Yu, the last ruler of the Southern Tang dynasty. It is the third TV series focusing on the complex friend-foe relationship between these two historical characters (though in history no such relationship exists), after the 1986 Singaporean series The Sword and the Song and the 1996 Taiwanese series Love, Sword, Mountain & River, but the plot-lines differ somewhat. Li Yu and Zhao Kuangyin were two emperors during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Li Yu was kind and respectful, while Zhao Kuangyin was rough and ambitious. They had different backgrounds and attitudes towards life, resulting in two drastically different futures. Zhao Kuangyin and Zhou Ehuang fell in love at first sight and they planned to visit Southern Tang together. They met Li Yu, and they formed an unlikely friendship. However because of fate, Zhou Ehuang ultimately married Li Yu and she became the Queen. The marriage between Zhou Ehuang and Li Yu deteriorated when Li Yu also had an affair with Zhou Ehuang's sister, Zhou Jiamin, who later became Queen Zhou the Younger and their second son died at the age of three.

The company manufactures and sells lingerie, sleepwear, swimwear, activewear, and other products. The brand offers products in sizes ranging from petite to plus. The company was started by Morgan Hermand-Waiche in 2010 while he was an MBA student at Harvard Business School. History Adore Me was founded by Morgan Hermand-Waiche. He first got the idea of lingerie company in 2010 during his second year at Harvard Business School‚Äôs M.B.A program, when he couldn't find lingerie that was both high quality and affordable. Hermand-Waiche spent three years working at management consulting firm McKinsey & Company prior to Adore Me. where he met Romain Liot, who came on in the early days as COO. Gary Bravard Gary Bravard, the current Head of Business Development, and Forbes Retail 30 under 30, also joined early on. Initial investors in Adore Me include Hermand-Waiche‚Äôs Harvard professors, and angel investors Fabrice Grinda and Jose Marin. The company officially launched its website in March 2012. In the same year, Adore Me raised $2.5 million in its second round of funding with investments from Redhills Ventures, Jaina Capital, Ventech Capital, and other US angel investors. Adore Me reportedly sold 100,000 items in their first year of business. In July 2013, Adore Me raised $8.5 million from investors in a Series B round of funding. Investors included Upfront Ventures, Redhills Ventures, and Mousse Partners. In 2014, Adore Me was listed as the second fastest-growing private retail company on the Inc. 5000 list based on their 2013 sales of $5.6 million. They went on to generate $16.2 million in sales in 2014. In 2016, Adore Me was ranked #9 on Crain‚Äôs list of New York‚Äôs 50 Fastest-Growing Companies. Revenue for 2016 was $83.9 million. In 2017, Adore Me was named one of the Internet Retailer Top 1000 companies from DigitalCommerce360 and was listed on the Inc. 5000 list for the third time in four years. As of 2017, Adore Me had 121 full-time employees. Resilient Retail The company has outlined the management philosophy that has guided it since inception in a post from Hermand-Waiche entitled, Resilient Retail: The Adore Me model for ecommerce. The company has been guided by three principles that work together to allow a business to be built to respond to challenges unique in a digital world: Flexibility - Being long- term focused and smart around utilizing leverage. Hermand-Waiche first indicated the importance of being strategic and avoiding over-raising capital in a 2015 Techcrunch op-ed. Agility - Building technological and logistical infrastructure that allows constant evolution of services and products. The company has been recognized by publications like the MIT Technology Review for building cutting-edge infrastructure that positions the company well to compete in an increasingly automated and competitive retail world. Adaptability - Building a culture around hiring adaptive people who thrive on change and uncertainty. The combination of these three principles has helped the company navigate the incredibly turbulent pandemic period and achieve a record April, seeing 66% YoY growth.  Service  The company uses a style quiz and associated algorithm to recommend products and sizes to customers. Adore Me currently offers three ways to shop on their website: # Adore Me VIP: a monthly subscription box with lingerie from the 40-60 new designs that are released every month. # Adore Me Elite Membership Program: a fast-growing, subscription-based service launched in 2017 that lets customers try on items before they purchase them. # Adore Me Pay As You Go (PAYG) service: allows customers to make a one-time purchase. With a mobile app (both iOS and Android), 80% of Adore Me‚Äôs shopper traffic comes in from mobile.  Technology  Since its inception, Adore Me has striven to be as much a technology company as a retailer. CEO Hermand-Waiche has argued that the trend of \\"Outsourced Brands\\", or DTC brands that avoid building their own technology and logistics infrastructure, are unable to scale in ways to meet the evolving demands of customers. Adore Me was one of the first retailers to use Angular technology ‚Äì the complete JavaScript-based, open-source, front-end web application framework supported by Google ‚Äì on its mobile and desktop websites. Its Chief Technology Officer, Bogdan Lucaciu, has been a strong proponent of agile development frameworks and experimentation, leading the development of an entire suite of proprietary retail technology that allows the team to deliver strong results in everything from conversion rates, to the optimization of marketing spend, to reducing waste and cost-saving in procurement.  Sustainability  Adore Me launched the Embrace Life, Disrupt Fashion initiative in 2019 to operationalize sustainability efforts across the entire organization. As of April 2020, the company has launched two sustainable collections and will be launching 10 new sustainable collections through 2020. In addition to sustainable brands, Adore Me is adamant that change must occur across the entire supply chain, optimizing their procurement processes to minimize waste and committing to no air-shipping. They have additionally integrated water-conserving, digital-printing into swimwear, are transitioning to fully biodegradable packaging.  Adore Me Services (AMS)  Adore Me owns and operates its own 130,000 square foot distribution center in Secaucus, New Jersey: Adore Me Services (AMS). The brand officially opened the center in January 2019, with the expressed goal of leveraging a collection of cutting-edge technologies to help rapidly introduce new ways (including addressing the logistical complexities of Adore Me's new try-at-home service) to shop, a series of satellite brands and servicing a network of physical retail stores. The MIT Technology Review recognized the automation technologies built into the AMS systems, including a high-density robotic storage and order picking system (AutoStore), two automated putwalls (OPEX Sure Sort), as an example of how a mid-sized retailer can compete with e-commerce giants like Amazon: \\"by being smaller, closer to home, and more flexible.\\"The combination of automation, along with a commitment to worker safety, helped Adore Me manage to maintain consistent delivery throughout a major surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Expansion into retail  In April 2016, Adore Me opened their first retail store as a showroom at their New York City headquarters. In June 2016, Adore Me partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling products in Nordstrom stores and on the company‚Äôs e-commerce site. As of October 2016, Adore Me also partnered with Lord and Taylor to begin selling products in the Manhattan flagship store and online. Adore Me opened its first permanent brick and mortar retail store in June, 2018. The first store if the brand is located in Staten Island Mall, NY ‚Äî developed in partnership with Brookfield. Adore Me strives to make retail a profitable growth story, and has been leveraging technology like \\"smart\\" fitting rooms: the Adore Me customer can place an item, embedded with a radio frequency identification tag, on the hook in her fitting room to activate the fitting-room display screen. It will indicate the item chosen in full detail ‚Äî revealing a product image, as well as size run and colors available. On Black Friday of 2018, at 6:00 am ET, Adore Me opened its second retail store, located in Bridgewater Commons Mall, Bridgewater, NJ. The store is 3,600 square-foot in size‚Äîwhich is double the size of its first location which opened in June 2018 at Staten Island Mall, in the Staten Island borough of New York City. The larger store incorporates lounge areas to encourage involvement with the space. The two stores were designed by New York City-based Lawrence Group. In April 2019, Adore Me opened its third retail location at Providence Place Mall in Providence, Rhode Island. In May 2019 a fourth location was opened in Willowbrook, New Jersey. Both of these locations are owned by Brookfield Properties.  The Adore Me Group Brands  2019 started a string of acquisitions and development of new brands. In February of 2019, Adore Me purchased maternity brand Belabumbum. Adore Me states that ‚Äúthe acquisition was part of Adore Me's strategy to boost further growth by broadening the product offering to serve new phases of a woman's life‚Äù. Belabumbum offers intimate apparel, sleep, lounge, and activewear for expecting and new moms. In June of 2019, Adore Me launched its first satellite brand, called Walkpop. Walkpop is a legwear brand. Walkpop‚Äôs offering is legwear, leggings, tights, and socks. Walkpop carries a wide range of sizes, styles, and tights for all skin tones. In January of 2020, Adore Me launched period panties brand, Joyja. The panties come in sizes XS-4X. With the tagline ‚ÄúThe Happy Period Panties,‚Äù Joyja wants to bring more joy to ‚Äúthat time of the month‚Äù with bright colors, quirky prints, easy usage, and a significantly lower environmental impact than plastic tampons and pads. The brand also wants to improve access of period products for menstruating people in the US living below the poverty line. They do this through affordable pricing and by product donations _Adore Me currently operates the following retail brands:_ * Belabumbum * Joyja * Walkpop  Products  Initially, Adore Me products included lingerie, sleepwear, swimwear, and related apparel. Bra sizes range from 30A to 46G. In October 2016, Adore Me launched an activewear collection. Similarly to the bras and panties, the activewear collection includes sizes from petite to plus. In April 2017, Adore Me announced that they had launched their largest swim collection to date, with 88 pieces for standard and plus sized women. Current head of design, Helen Mears, formerly worked as head designer of the Angels brand at Victoria‚Äôs Secret. Adore Me primarily sells its products online. Customers shop through personalized ‚Äúshowrooms‚Äù and can purchase products a-la-carte on a one time basis or as part of a monthly subscription, known as ‚ÄúVIP Membership.‚Äù Products are currently shipped to customers in the U.S. and Canada. In December 2017, Adore Me launched their Bijou Collection. This luxury designer collection used fabrics such as velvet, French lace as well as gold logo plates and piercings. This collection retailed from $69.99-$79.99. Today, Adore Me carries various product categories, including bras and panties, lingerie, sleepwear, gifts, activewear, corsets and bralettes.  Branding Campaigns  During International Women‚Äôs Day and the month of March 2019, Adore Me partnered with non-profit organization Girls Inc. who's programming focus on the development of girls; supporting, mentoring, and guiding girls in an affirming, pro-girl environment. Adore Me sold a collection of panties featuring female-empowering prints with 100% of proceeds donated to Girls Inc. In 2018, Adore Me conducted an artistic portrait series together with New York-based photojournalist Aude Adrien, highlighting women working at Adore Me, and their stories of how they got to where they are now, what inspires them, and how they define empowerment. Every participant brought an object that defines what empowerment is or feels like to them - this is shot in the portrait. The objects are highly personal, and the women brought everything from their passport, to a book, to a photograph of someone they admire.  TV Show Appearances  Project Runway: All Stars: Adore Me was featured on the final season of Project Runway: All Stars. Adore Me's Head Designer Helen Mears introduced the challenge for the third episode. The challenge was to create an outfit that used innerwear as outerwear, specifically, a corset. Christina Exie won the challenge and had her winning corset sold on AdoreMe.com after the episode aired.  International expansion  Upon until 2017, Adore Me has primarily focused on the North American market, delivering its products to all states in the U.S. The service and full product assortment is also available to shoppers in Canada, Australia, and the UK. In September 2018, Adore Me officially announced its expansion to start selling in China. The brand has begun launching its products using the interactive livestream platform & global shopping marketplace service, ShopShops.  Models  Adore Me has promoted \\"body positivity\\" and \\"inclusivity\\" within the brand. They have worked with models such as Iskra Lawrence, a spokesmodel for body positive campaigns; and Nina Agdal, a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model; In 2016 Adore Me worked with plus model Sophie Tweed-Simmons.  Customer Service  Customer reviews are visible and available for each product on adoreme.com, assisting customers to see product fit, satisfaction and beyond. Adore Me received Retail TouchPoints ‚ÄòCustomer Engagement Awards‚Äô in 2017 and 2018. The brand won the Excellence Awards as Best in 2018 Class Omnichannel Experience during Customer Contact Week. In December 2017, the company implemented a hybrid-bot on its website. The hybrid-bot enables Adore Me customers to receive live support via several messaging platforms. In the company's early days, many customers had complained about its use of the controversial practice of negative option billing. Adore Me offered the customers the choice of buying a product at full price or of buying the same product at a substantial discount by joining a membership club. The club then billed customers a fixed amount each month unless the customer bought lingerie or opted out for the month. While the membership may be cancelled, the customers have found it difficult to cancel. Following an investigation filed by the Federal Trade Commission about Adore Me's deceptive billing practices, the company agreed to refund up to $1.38 million to customers that had previously forfeited their store credits and to clearly disclose how much customers would pay on its monthly subscription plan. In 2017, Adore Me announced the launch of its scholarship program, offering a $1,000 scholarship to support women pursuing a degree in business. The company began awarding female students who had either started their own business or were planning to do so in the future.

Doyle and was released on 21 October 2013 by Om Books. The story follows Vijay and his friends, as they try to decipher a series of clues which would lead them to a devastating Secret hidden by a brotherhood known as the Nine Men. Doyle had initially started writing a story for his daughter, which gradually expanded into the book. The author was primarily inspired by the Indian epic Mahabharata, believing its events to be based on scientific facts. The book was followed by Doyle's second novel, The Mahabharata Quest: The Alexander Secret, which is the first book in a planned trilogy of sequels. Doyle believes in the possibility of the existence of a secret history which was probably not recorded in antiquity. While researching he also came across legends prevalent about King Ashoka and linked the story with him. Following its release, The Mahabharata Secret was a commercial success, which enabled the author to get signed for further thriller novels based on the subject matter and was also nominated for the 2014 Crossword Book Award. Plot synopsis In 244 BC, Indian emperor Ashoka finds a hilly cave with an astonishing secret. Believing it could destroy the world, he creates a secret brotherhood of Nine Men, who would guard the cave's contents through the centuries. He also removed the Vimana Parva chapter of the Indian epic, Mahabharata, from its written transcripts. In present day, Vikram Singh, an Indian nuclear scientist, is murdered at his fort in Jaungarh. Before his death he sent four cryptic emails to his nephew Vijay, who with his business partner Colin, childhood friend Radha and her father, linguist Dr. Shukla, start analyzing it. They are aided by Bheem Singh, current owner of Rajvirgarh fort and Greg White, an archaeologist mentioned in Vikram's emails. The group deduce that the emails refer to the Nine Men and their secret, which can be revealed by using a metal disc, a key, a ball of rock and a riddle. Their mission is interrupted by a man called Farooq, a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant. The group find that the metal disc and the key together point to the Edicts of Ashoka. They travel to Bairat and find a hidden library of the Nine, but are imprisoned inside by Farooq and his men. The group find an alternate route and the ball of rock. The Barabar Caves, location of the second inscribed ball. In the meantime, Intelligence Bureau (IB) official Imran Kidwai gets information about Farooq and starts investigating. Vijay and his friends travel to the Barabar Caves in Bihar after interpreting a clue in Bairat. Inside the caves they unearth another such ball with inscriptions on it. However, Vijay and Radha are kidnapped by Farooq. Imran suspects Bheem Singh and investigates in his basement, but gets caught. Bheem explains that the Vimana Parva of the Mahabharata spoke about ancient arsenal which could be made invisible by covering them with an undisclosed element, thus making them fatal. This was what the Nine tried to protect. Imran understands that Bheem was allied with Farooq and were trying to discover the secret location of the weapons. In an ensuing conflict, Bheem's attack on Imran backfires and he himself is killed. Farooq had given 48 hours time to Vijay's friends to decipher the meaning of the final clue in the ball. They unearth the final secret to be at Hazaribagh, atop a hill called Marang Buru. Farooq and his men escape with Vijay on being notified of Imran's advance, leaving Radha behind. As the whole group reaches Marang Buru, there it is revealed that Greg was actually an assassin employed by Farooq called Murphy, impersonating the real Greg White. On Farooq's insistence, Vijay and Colin enter the hill and through numerous chambers reach the secret vault of the Nine. There they discover the giant artillery, including the nuclear weapons. Farooq and his henchmen start collecting the weapons, unaware that Imran and Indian commandos had surrounded them. Colin, Shukla and Vijay are rescued and reunite with Radha, with Imran driving them away from Hazaribagh. A mistimed grenade blasts the secret cavern, destroying the hillside and killing off Farooq and the others, thereby wiping out the Nine's secret. A few days later, Vijay re-reads his uncle's e-mails and finds another clue, directing him to the vicinity of Jaungarh fort. There he finds a secret chamber containing the documents belonging to the Nine, as well as important texts, scriptures and ancient artifacts. A letter from his uncle reveals him as the last member of the Nine, and a request for Vijay to accept the guardianship of the documents. Vijay accepts and becomes a member of the Nine Men. Development Author Christopher C. Doyle had studied Business Management from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta and runs a firm for training CEO and CXOs. However, he always had a childhood weakness for fantasy novels, being inspired by authors like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, J. R. R. Tolkien as well as Robert Jordan.The Mahabharata Secret, 2013, p. 2 One day he started writing a novel for his daughter, who was interested in stories based on fantasy and science. However, as she grew older, she wanted a more mature story. It was then that Doyle decided to expand the story and write it into a full novel. He was inspired by a 1917 book he had read, The Hindu History by Akshay Majumdar, which wrote about an alternate history of India by combining legends and mythology. Doyle was also intrigued by the Indian epic Mahabharata which translated into \\"this is what happened\\". He thought about the basis of the epic in history and science and moved forward with his writing. Two other books contributed to his inspiration and research, Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock and Uriel's Machine by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas. His reading led him to the conclusion that the Mahabharata might be true, and he stated that: > And if the Mahabharata was true, then it was possible that some of the > fantastic events described in the Mahabharata could have a scientific base > as well, which no one has explored as of now. This fascinating thought > lingered in my mind and propelled me to explore this aspect further. So > that's really how history, mythology and science came together. Doyle researched the legends surrounding King Ashoka, including those of the Nine Men, and Ashoka's alleged suppression of science. Doyle says he used such legends to develop a plot about the brotherhood of the Nine, setting it between 200 BC and 500 BC. Doyle visited The Asiatic Society in Kolkata to review material on Ashoka and emperor's edicts that are preserved there. Doyle stated that it took him two years to finalize and complete The Mahabharata Secret. According to Doyle, the fictional weapon in the book \\"used a totally different scientific concept which I had to build from scratch. The use of hard core science and accepted scientific fact to explain mythology was something that makes my books different\\". Release and reception The Mahabharata Secret was released by Om Books on 21 October 2013. Following its release, the book was a commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies within two years. It was nominated for the 2014 Crossword Book Award with Vivek Tejuja of Scroll.in giving a positive feedback, comparing the novel with that of author Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code (2003), and adding \\"A suspense thriller served with large helpings of history makes for a good in-flight read.\\" Seeing the success of the book, Westland Publishers signed Doyle to write a thriller trilogy inspired by the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata Quest: The Alexander Secret, Doyle's second novel and the first in the planned trilogy, was released in October 2014.

Due to his experience with the Vortex Spring cave system, Sorenson was involved in the 2010 search for missing diver Ben McDaniel. After an extensive search Sorenson believed that McDaniel was not trapped in the cave because of lack of evidence and disturbance to the cave commonly seen after a diver passes through. He stated, \\"The last place I searched was pristine, without a mark that a diver had been there. It would be impossible to go through that restriction without making a mark on the floor or ceiling.

Taxonomy and distribution At one time, nearly all the short-tailed crickets in the United States were considered to belong to the species Anurogryllus muticus, the range of which extended from Canada to much of South America. In a revision of the genus made by T. J. Walker in 1973, Anurogryllus arboreus was split off on the basis of the behavior of the male when calling, and on certain morphological differences. A. arboreus occurs primarily along the Atlantic Coast from New Jersey to Florida and westward to southeastern Texas. The only other species of Anurogryllus found in the United States is A. celerinictus, which occurs on the Florida Keys. Behavior A. arboreus lives solitarily in a burrow which it digs, carrying soil particles to the surface with its mandibles. Males dig temporary burrows but females may reside in one burrow for an extended period. Besides the main tunnel, typically long, there are side chambers in which the insect resides and feeds, and a refuse chamber used to deposit fecal pellets and discarded vegetable matter. Some lateral tunnels are dug to enable the cricket to feed on plant roots without emerging on the soil surface. Except when the insect is outside foraging or looking for a mate, the entrance to the burrow is kept plugged with soil or vegetation. Breeding takes place once a year between April and June. The male emerges from his burrow at nightfall and calls from a perch in a tree or other high place in the early part of the night. When a female is attracted, mating may take place near the perch, or in a burrow. The female lays several dozen eggs in a breeding chamber and defends her burrow fiercely against the intrusion of males. She tends the eggs by palpating them and turning them over, and gathers and deposits bits of vegetation on which the newly-hatched nymphs feed. She also lays trophic (unfertilised) eggs for their nourishment. The nymphs keep together in a compact group, often on the roof of the chamber, and follow the female about when she is nearby. The female typically dies when the nymphs are part grown, and soon afterwards they disperse and dig their own burrows.

A talented artist with a number of pioneering performances in both Cork and New York, he unsuccessfully tried to save the Irish language among the New York Irish. Life and work McSwiney was born in Cork.Brown/Stratton: British Musical Biography (Birmingham, 1897). Nothing is known about his early life and education before the first performance of his opera Amergen in the Cork Opera House on 23 February 1881. A significant event in local music history, the opera to his libretto was praised for its drama and melodic content, but less so for its musical craftsmanship.Cork Examiner, 23‚Äì26 (daily) & 28 February 1881; The Cork Constitution, 22 & 24 February 1881. It is also an important work in the development of Celticist influences in Irish opera and classical music generally.Axel Klein: \\"Stage-Irish, or The National in Irish Opera, 1780‚Äì1925\\", in: Opera Quarterly 21 (2005), p. 27‚Äì67. Soon after the week of performances, McSwiney went to London and in 1883 to New York, where he became the musical director of the New York branch of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language. The first work he produced in that capacity was An B√°rd 'gus an F√≥, subtitled \\"A Gaelic Idyll\\", a dramatic cantata for soloists, choir and orchestra, first performed at Steinway Hall on 28 November 1884.New York Times, 27 December 1884. However, it was not before the work was produced in an English version as The Bard and the Knight in the following year that the work could attract a larger audience. Other works to which he contributed both music and words were Alexander, a Musical Drama and the unfinished cantata John McHale. Some of his songs became popular in America.D.J. O'Donoghue: \\"McSwiney, Paul\\", in: The Poets of Ireland. A Biographical Dictionary of Irish Writers of English Verse (Dublin, 1912). He also produced a number of plays, such as Brian (1888), Cupid and Crime (1889), The Fairies Doll, and a novel, Nirvana. McSwiney's failure with An B√°rd 'gus an F√≥ is significant for the diminishing importance of the Irish language among the immigrant Irish during the late 19th century.

The quartet was initially fashioned in one continuous piece. On revising it, probably in 1874, Dvo≈ô√°k began to split the music into the conventional four movements, and set the Andante Appassionato portion aside as a separate item. The last bar of the piece would originally have led into the next section of the complete quartet, and as such, according to Jarmil Burghauser, it would have modulated in key. Instead of this, for the single movement piece, Burghauser provided a suggested F major conclusion with a lengthened tonic note. This is the version recorded by the Prager Streichquartett for the Deutsche Grammophon complete set of Dvo≈ô√°k's string quartet works. See CD notes. The piece has been described as \\"somewhat reminiscent of Schubertian Romanticism\\".English- language version of page about Dvo≈ô√°k's Andante Appassionato for String Quartet B.40a at a Czech site Position in the original string quartet The piece starts in A minor and ends on a chord of F major.Parts for the Quartet No.6 and the Andante Appassionato published together by Barenreiter/Supraphon Urtext edition/ Kriticke Vydani (H6549) in 1983 The start and end keys thus give it a potential place in Dvo≈ô√°k's String Quartet number 6 between movements 1 (which ends in A major) & 2 (which starts in F major). Some of the writing of the Andante Appassionato is reminiscent of the start of the second movement of the quartet number 6, which makes the sequence 'Movement 1-Andante Appassionato- Movement 2' credible in the current completed forms of the pieces.Prager SQ DG CD recording of SQ No. 6 (429-198-2) and Andante Appassionato (429-194-2) Note, however, that Burghauser describes it as originally 'leading to the [fourth movement] finale'.

Two days later, he sent a letter to the boards expanding on the memorandum, suggesting that they reclassify Selective Service registrants as delinquent if they were in violation of any of the Selective Service Act or Regulations. The New York Times published the text of both documents on November 9, 1967.The New York Times, 9-November-1967, page 2 Text of the Memorandum Sent October 24, 1967 > Subject: Disposition of Abandoned or Mutilated Registration Certificate and > Notices of Classification. 1.

Legal status After several U.S. Supreme Court and lower court cases (see the article Lewis Blaine Hershey for details) overturned most of Memorandum No. 85, Hershey issued Local Board Memorandum No. 101 on 21-January-1970, which recommended that the boards \\"suspend all processing of delinquents.\\" All of the major cases involved \\"abandoned or mutilated\\" draft cards, but the various opinions made it clear that the Letter, as well as the Memorandum, was unlawful.http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED063217.pdf, pp. 61-74 Notes 1967 in the United States ","title":"Hershey Directive"},{"id":"47170734","text":"LendingCrowd is an online peer-to-peer lending company, based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

In the framework of Discourse Grammar, cooptation is understood as leading to the transfer of linguistic material from the domain of Sentence Grammar to that of Thetical Grammar. An example The operation of cooptation can be illustrated with the following utterance taken from the British component of the International Corpus of English:. *What I‚Äôve done here I hope you don‚Äôt entirely disapprove is try and limit the time taken on this item by putting it in writing. (ICE-GB: s1b-075-180) In this example, the utterance is obviously composed of two pieces: On the one hand, there is the well-formed and self-contained sentence What I‚Äôve done here is try and limit the time taken on this item by putting it in writing, which provides the host construction. On the other hand, there is the piece I hope you don‚Äôt entirely disapprove, which is inserted in the host construction but neither syntactically nor semantically, nor prosodically integrated in the host construction, and rather than contributing to the meaning of the sentence, it relates to the situation of discourse. Such inserts are commonly known as parentheticals or extra-clausal constituents. In the framework of Discourse Grammar they are referred to as theticals, and cooptation is the operation that enables speakers to transfer them from one domain of grammar to the other, and to place them in various slots of the host construction. Principles and concepts Sentence Grammar is organized in terms of propositional concepts and clauses and their combination while Thetical Grammar concerns the linguistic discourse beyond the sentence. While being in principle separate domains, the two interact in various ways in organizing linguistic discourse, and the main way of interaction is via cooptation. Cooptation is fully productive, that is, it can be employed by speakers any time to structure speech. As long as the hearer can be expected to construct a reasonable hypothesis on the relevance of the coopted unit to the utterance concerned there are few restrictions on what form the coopted unit may take and where it can be placed in its host construction.

The film was released by Warner Bros. on January 11, 1941. Plot Aboard a ship, newspaper reporter Jim Moore falls for passenger Sandy Vantine and meets her Uncle Paul, who is in possession of a small wooden chest that he believes could be a copy made by the mysterious Black Parrot, a notorious art forger. Scotland Yard inspector Colonel Piggott is also aboard, presumably on the Parrot's tail. Jim proposes to Sandy and meets her relatives and family acquaintances. They include Madame de Charierre, the chest's rightful owner, whose maid Julia had been trying to retrieve it because a secret drawer contained compromising love letters. A police constable, Grady, arrives, so Jim gets in touch with Piggott as well. Paul and another guest quickly end up dead, Piggott quickly declaring that everyone in the house a suspect. A second hidden compartment contains priceless diamonds. Jim and Sandy realize just in time that Piggott himself is the Black Parrot, after the jewels all along.

It is complete with standard equipment‚Äîa priceless old cabinet with secret drawers, a be-ribboned packet of scented letters, veiled women bearing a double identity, muffled figures silhouetted at the library window as the clock chimes midnight, and a butler with a guilt complex (probably because all the scenarists are pointing the finger of suspicion at him, but that doesn't fool us any more). But somehow each moment of suspense is merely a prelude to long- winded deductions in the library. In short, The Case of the Black Parrott is on the verbose side, though there's no such bird in it.\\"  References   External links   1941 films American films English-language films Warner Bros. films American crime films 1941 crime films Films directed by Noel M.
