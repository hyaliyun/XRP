Hauge Olav H√•konson Hauge (18 August 1908 - 23 May 1994) was a Norwegian horticulturist, translator and poet. Biography Hauge was born at the village of Ulvik in Hordaland, Norway. His parents H√•kon Hauge (1877-1954) and Katrina Hakestad (1873-1975) were farmers. Hauge attended middle school in Ulvik 1925‚Äì1926. He learned English and German in school and later taught himself French by reading. He spent many years training in horticulture and fruit cultivation. He went to Hjeltnes Horticulture School (Hjeltnes videreg√•ende skole) in Ulvik (1927 and 1933‚Äì34), Norwegian University of Life Sciences at √Ös (1930) and the State Research Center (Statens fors√∏ksgardt) at Hermannsverk in Sogn og Fjordane (1931-1933). He lived his whole life in Ulvik working as a gardener in his own apple orchard. Hauge's first poems were published in 1946, all in a traditional form. He later wrote modernist poetry and in particular concrete poetry that inspired other, younger Norwegian poets, such as Jan Erik Vold. A well-known example, in the Norwegian original: :Katten :sit i tunet :n√•r du kjem. :Snakk litt med katten. :Det er han som er varast i garden. In English translation: :The cat is sitting :out front :when you come. :Talk a bit with the cat. :He is the most sensitive one here. Aside from writing his own poems, he was internationally oriented, and translated poems by Alfred Tennyson, William Butler Yeats, Robert Browning, St√©phane Mallarm√©, Arthur Rimbaud, Stephen Crane, Friedrich H√∂lderlin, Georg Trakl, Paul Celan, Bertolt Brecht and Robert Bly to Norwegian. He also wrote poetry in homage to fellow poets William Blake, Paul Celan, G√©rard de Nerval and Emily Dickinson. He was also inspired by classical Chinese poetry, e.g. in his poem \\"T\`ao Ch\`ien\\" in the collection Sp√∏r vinden. Hauge has been translated to English by the Scottish poet Robin Fulton in Olav Hauge: Selected Poems, from 1990, and by the American poet Robert Bly in Trusting Your Life to Water and Eternity: Twenty Poems of Olav H. Hauge, from 1987. The American author Robert Hedin translated Hauge in 2001 in the collection The Bullfinch Rising from the Cherry Tree: Poems of Olav H. Hauge and in Leaf-huts and Snow-houses in 2004. Robert Bly and Robert Hedin together translated Hauge in 2008 in The Dream We Carry: Selected and Last Poems of Olav H. Hauge. Words from Glor i oska were used as lyrics for the Solefald song \\"Song til stormen\\" off of their 2010 album, Norr√∏n Livskunst. Olav H. Hauge Center (Olav H. Hauge - Senteret) is situated on Brakanes near Ulvikafjorden. The center includes an exhibition, library of poetry, poetry workshop and museum highlighting the poet's life and work.

It replaced the Special Deluxe when Plymouth changed its naming scheme and was essentially the same as the Plymouth Concord and Cambridge, but at a higher trim level. The name Cranbrook may have been taken from a city in British Columbia, but it may also have been taken from Cranbrook Drive in Detroit; this small street intersected with Cambridge Avenue. Both streets are between 7 Mile Road West and 8 Mile Road West, near the Dodge Main plant. Concord Street ran by the plant. This indicates that the cars may have been named after streets near Chrysler Corporation facilities. 1951 - 1952 (P-23 series) The Plymouth Cranbrook, as a car, was conservatively styled, designed to fit K.T. Keller's notion that cars be practical and allow drivers to sit upright while wearing a hat; it was sold at a time when competitors favored the low and sleek look. Differences between the 1950 Special Deluxe and the 1951 Plymouth Cranbrook are relatively few in number and scope, with interchangeable glass and doors, but different rubber seals; lack of woodgrain on the instrument panel; plastic brake handle instead of chrome; and other similar changes. More substantial was having what had been the hood release handle function as the overdrive control. Fender lettering and other badging necessarily changed as well.

The windshield went to a modern one-piece unit; and the door handles pulled out instead of twisting. The glove box was moved to the center for easier access by the driver. The gas cap was moved to under the trunk lid, resulting in initial problems with gas spilling out of a full tank into the trunk; this problem was resolved with baffles in mid-1953. The three-window coupe and fastback sedan were dropped for 1953; the former long and short wheelbase models were consolidated with a common wheelbase of , only one inch shorter than those of Chevrolet and Ford (though considerably less overhang than those competitors gave the Cranbrook a \\"shorter\\" look.)

He was a fellow student at Giessen University with a brother of Charlotte (Werther's inamorata), and was well acquainted with Werther himself. In an appendix to his English version of Goethe's romance, Render relates a conversation he had with Werther at Frankfort-on-the-Main a few days before the latter's suicide. Render was ordained to the Lutheran ministry. Subsequently he acted as 'traveling guardian to the son of a distinguished personage'. He then traveled in western Germany with 'several English gentlemen', one of whom may have been Francis, afterwards the Marquis Hastings, to whom, as Earl of Moira, he dedicated his Tour through Germany. Render came to England about 1790, and settled in London. He taught German and other languages 'in several families of distinction.' Towards the end of the century he also became 'teacher of German' at Cambridge, Oxford, and Edinburgh. In 1798 he published an English version of Kotzebue's play Count Benyowsky, which reached a second edition within the year. In 1800, Render further translated The Robbers, Don Carlos, Maria Stuart, and The Armenian of Schiller. In the following year appeared his version of The Sorrows of Werther, the first translation into English made direct from the original German. In the preface he speaks of 'his friend the baron Goethe', whom he may have met at Frankfurt. Render's Tour through Germany, particularly along the Banks of the Rhine, Mayne, also appeared in 1801. A vocabulary of familiar phrases in German and English is annexed for the benefit of travelers. The remainder of Render's publications were educational manuals. The chief of these, A concise Practical Grammar of the German Tongue (1799), was very successful. A fifth edition, corrected and augmented with improvements made by the Berlin Academy, was issued in 1817. As a token of his appreciation of the work, Alexander I of Russia ordered Woronzow, his ambassador in England, to present Render with a ring and an autograph letter. Render also published German Exercises, a Pocket Dictionary in English and German, and other manuals of instruction in German.

In 1959, the International Legal Studies building, now the Lewis International Law Center, was constructed to house approximately 300,000 volumes in open-stacks. In 1997, Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch and Abbott was appointed once again, this time to renovate the building. The renovations expanded the library, which now takes up most of the building, with the exception of two classrooms- the Vorenberg and Kirkland & Ellis. The renovation also included the installation of air conditioning and additional women's restrooms. Other notable parts of the building include the Caspersen Room, named for HLS alumnus Finn M. W. Caspersen (J.D. 1966). The Caspersen Room, formerly called the Treasure Room, once housed part of the library's collection of rare books and manuscripts. The lobby of the building is graced by a statue of Joseph Story, Harvard professor and Supreme Court justice, sculpted by his son, William Wetmore Story.

History  Ekklesia was founded in 2002 by Jonathan Bartley and Simon Barrow. In September 2002, Ekklesia launched a Sunday programme on BBC Radio Scotland to encourage pacification and minimize violent insurrections in Iraq. In June 2006, Ekklesia launched a campaign advocating for the separation of the role of the Church and State in weddings. The think tank argued that the \\"one size fits all\\" attempt to fuse religious and civic marriage was a source of great confusion. In February 2009, the Bishop of Willesden Pete Broadbent called the directors of Ekklesia ¬´self-appointed self-publicists who speak for nobody [...] and pretend that they're speaking for mainstream Christianity¬ª. In 2010, when the Christian Concern lobbying group launched the Not Ashamed Day, Ekklesia stated there was no evidence Catholics were being shamed because of their religion. In June 2011, Symon Hill, a bisexual Christian writer and a director of Ekklesia, embarked on a Birmingham-to-London pilgrimage against homophobia. In October 2012, Ekklesia, in partnership with Edinburgh City Centre Churches Together, the Cornerstone Bookshop, and the Episcopal Diocese of Edinburgh‚Äôs Adventures in Faith programme, launched the Centre for Living Christianity (CLiC) to explore religious faith in skeptical times. In March 2016, Ekklesia organized a group letter to ask the new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Stephen Crabb, to think again his ministry's position regarding welfare cuts and benefit sanctions. Jonathan Bartley left the think tank in 2016 and subsequently became co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales. In June 2019, during the Donald Trump's official visit to the UK, Simon Barrow called the US President ¬´anti-gospel¬ª.

Ferry was born in Metz. He studied law at the University of Nancy and worked as a writer and publisher. During the First World War he served with the French Army. He was three times wounded, promoted to captain, received the Croix de guerre, and was made a member of L√©gion d'honneur. This led to his being elected as prime minister of marines. After the war, Ferry was appointed by Georges Clemenceau to work on the reintegration of the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine which had been recovered from the German Empire. In the 1919 elections, he stood as the junior candidate for the Chamber of Deputies on a list headed by future president Albert Lebrun. The list was elected in its entirety in the overwhelming victory for the Bloc national. Ferry was reelected continuously until 1936, when he lost his seat. He was generally associated with the F√©d√©ration r√©publicaine, from 1932 to 1936 with the Republican Centre. Ferry served as a very successful Minister of Marine in the short-lived government of Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois-Marsal. In 1930, he served as Minister of Health in the second government of Andr√© Tardieu. In this job, he did what he could to ameliorate the unhealthy conditions in which French soldiers lived in. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Ferry was recalled to service as the commandant of the 128th Fortress Infantry Regiment. After having served and commanded righteously, he died from pulmonary congestion in the freezing temperatures (less than -25C) on the Maginot line on 11 January 1940 aged 54. He had with him two sons during the Second World War. His eldest, Nicolas Ferry, died on the field at the age of 21. After this, Nicolas's sister, Antoinette Ferry, became Sister Nicolas and lives in a convent in memorial of her brother. In 1941 Desire Ferry's younger son, Gilles Ferry, was captured at a battle near Brest. He then escaped less than a month later by pretending to be a Nazi soldier. He had to work as a German soldier for over seven days before he was able to eschew more ramifications and go back to France, the only man in the family left. Once the war was over, he became a writer and philosopher.

Background Fort Santiago A Spanish Filipino is any citizen or resident of the Philippines who is of Spanish or Hispanic origin. They are represented in all levels of Philippine society and are integrated politically and economically, in the private and government sector. Spanish Filipinos are present within several commerce and business sectors in the Philippines and a few sources estimate companies which comprise a significant portion of the Philippine economy are owned by Spanish Filipinos like International Container Terminal Services Inc., Manila Water, Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc., Ayala Land, Ynchausti y Compa√±ia, Ayala Corporation, Aboitiz & Company, Union Bank of the Philippines, ANSCOR, Bank of the Philippine Islands, Globe Telecom, Solaire Resort & Casino, to name but a few. Demographics = Background = The term Hispanic broadly refers to the people, nations, and cultures that have a historical link to Spain. It commonly applies to countries once part of the Spanish Empire, particularly the countries of Latin America, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, and Spanish Sahara. The Spanish culture and Spanish language are the main traditions. = Spanish Philippines = Between 1565 and 1898, Hispanics from Latin America and Spain sailed to and from the Philippine Islands. This contributed to the assimilation of the Hispanics into everyday society. According to an 1818 study by the renowned German ethnologist F√´dor Jagor entitled The Former Philippines thru Foreign Eyes, not less than one third of the inhabitants of the island of Luzon were descendants of Spaniards, mixed with varying degrees of South American, Chinese, and Indian ancestry and the vast majority of military personnel then had Latin-American origins. History Spanish Philippines is the history of the Philippines from 1521 to 1898. It begins with the arrival in 1521 of European explorer Ferdinand Magellan sailing for Spain, which heralded the period when the Philippines was an overseas province of Spain, and ends with the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. =Spanish East Indies= Cabildo Street, Intramuros, Manila, 1890s The Spanish East Indies (') were the Spanish territories in Asia-Pacific from 1565 until 1899. They comprised the Philippine Islands, Guam and the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands (Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia), and for some time parts of Formosa (Taiwan) and the Moluccas (Indonesia). Cebu was the first seat of government, later transferred to Manila. From 1565 to 1821 these territories, together with the Spanish West Indies, were administered through the Viceroyalty of New Spain based in Mexico City. =Captaincy General of the Philippines= The Captaincy General of the Philippines (; ) was an administrative district of the Spanish Empire. The Captaincy General encompassed the Spanish East Indies which included the modern country of the Philippines and various Pacific Island possessions, such as the Caroline Islands and Guam. It was founded in 1565 with the first permanent Spanish settlements. For centuries all the political and economic aspects of the Captaincy were administered in Mexico by the Viceroyalty of New Spain, while the administrative issues had to be consulted with the Spanish Crown or the Council of the Indies through the Royal Audience of Manila. However, in 1821, after Mexico became an independent nation, all control was transferred to Madrid. Language La Mestisa Espa√±ola (A Spanish Filipina) by Justiniano Asuncion In Asia, the Philippines, a former Spanish overseas province, was the lone sovereign nation representative of the Spanish language. Spanish was the lingua franca of the country from the beginning of Spanish rule in the late 1500s until the first half of the 20th century. It held official status for nearly half a millennium before being demoted as an optional language in 1987. However, Spanish still remained a very important language up until the mid-20th century but inauspicious circumstances resulted in its gradual decline over the decades.The National Archives (archived from the original on 2007-09-27), Houses the Spanish Collection, which consists of around 13 million manuscripts from the Spanish colonial period. Today, despite groups rallying to revive the language and make it a compulsory subject in schools, it is rarely used in everyday life or official settings and is spoken by less than 0.5% of the population. =Philippine Spanish= Philippine Spanish (Spanish: Espa√±ol Filipino, Castellano Filipino) is a Spanish dialect and a variant of Spanish spoken in the Philippines. Philippine Spanish is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Hispanic American emigration to the Spanish East Indies (Philippines) over the years. It is spoken mostly among Spanish Filipinos. =Chavacano= Chavacano or Chabacano is a Spanish-based creole language spoken in the Philippines. The word ' is derived from Spanish, meaning \\"poor taste\\", \\"vulgar\\", for the Chavacano language, developed in Cavite City, Ternate, Zamboanga and Ermita. It is also derived from the word chavano, coined by the Zamboangue√±o people. Six different dialects have developed: Zamboangue√±o in Zamboanga City, Davaoe√±o Zamboangue√±o / Castellano Abakay in Davao City, Ternate√±o in Ternate, Cavite, Cavite√±o in Cavite City, Cotabate√±o in Cotabato City and Ermite√±o in Ermita. Chavacano is the only Spanish-based creole in Asia. It has survived for more than 400 years, making it one of the oldest creole languages in the world. Among Philippine languages, it is the only one not an Austronesian language, but like Malayo- Polynesian languages, it uses reduplication. Literature Philippine literature in Spanish () is a body of literature made by Filipino writers in the Spanish language. Today, this corpus is the third largest in the whole corpus of Philippine literature (Philippine Literature in Filipino being the first, followed by Philippine literature in English). It is slightly larger than the Philippine literature in the vernacular languages. However, because of the very few additions to it in the past 30 years, it is expected that the former will soon overtake its rank. List of some famous Spanish Philippine literature: = Doctrina Christiana = The Doctrina Christiana was an early book of Roman Catholic Catechism, written in 1593 by Fray Juan de Plasencia, and is believed to be one of the earliest books printed in the Philippines. Noli Me Tangere =Noli Me T√°ngere= Noli Me T√°ngere (Latin for Touch Me Not) is a fictional novel written by Jos√© Rizal, one of the national heroes of the Philippines, during the colonization of the country by Spain to expose the inequities of the Spanish Catholic priests and the ruling government. Originally written in Spanish, the book is more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either Filipino or English. Together with its sequel, El Filibusterismo, the reading of Noli is obligatory for high school students throughout the country. =El Filibusterismo= El Filibusterismo (lit. Spanish for \\"The Filibustering\\"The Subersive or Subversion, as in the Locs√≠n English translation, are also possible translations.), also known by its English alternative title The Reign of Greed, is the second novel written by Philippine national hero Jos√© Rizal. It is the sequel to Noli me tangere and, like the first book, was written in Spanish. It was first published in 1891 in Ghent. The novel's dark theme departs dramatically from the previous novel's hopeful and romantic atmosphere, signifying the character Ibarra's resort to solving his country's issues through violent means, after his previous attempt at reforming the country's system have made no effect and seemed impossible with the attitudes of the Spaniards towards the Filipinos. The novel, along with its predecessor, was banned in some parts of the Philippines as a result of their portrayals of the Spanish government's abuse and corruption. These novels along with Rizal's involvement in organizations that aim to address and reform the Spanish system and its issues led to Rizal's exile to Dapitan and eventual execution. Both the novel and its predecessor, along with Rizal's last poem, are now considered Rizal's literary masterpieces. =Mi √öltimo Adi√≥s= Mi √öltimo Adi√≥s (English; \\"My Last Farewell\\") is a poem originally written in Spanish by Philippine national hero Dr. Jos√© Rizal on the eve of his execution by firing squad on 30 December 1896. The piece was one of the last notes he wrote before his death; another that he had written was found in his shoe but because the text was illegible, its contents today remain a mystery.

He displayed good speed at the beginning of his professional career, stealing as many as 25 bases in a season, although as his career went on he stole less and less each year. In 1984, he was the MVP of the Carolina League All-Star Game, going 5-for-6 with a home run, two triples and five RBI. He was voted Best Defensive Outfielder and Outfielder With the Best Arm that year by Baseball America. Beauchamp was the first player to be signed to a professional (major league affiliated) contract out of the independent leagues when, after hitting .367 with the Rochester Aces of the Northern League in 1993, he was signed by the Cincinnati Reds. He ended his playing career in 1995, and afterward he began managing and coaching various teams in different independent leagues. From 1995 to 1997, he was a hitting coach in the Montreal Expos farm system. From 1998 to 2000, he managed the New Jersey Jackals of the Northeast League. He managed the Lincoln Saltdogs in 2001 and then the Adirondack Lumberjacks for the next three seasons. He didn't manage in 2005, instead serving as the scouting director for the Golden Baseball League. During his time with the Golden League he was picked up as hitting coach for the Samurai Bears. He also had a role in the movie Season of the Samurai. He managed the Pensacola Pelicans of the American Association in 2006. In 2007, he served as Vice President/Director of Baseball Operations for the South Coast League. He also served as manager of the league's Anderson Joes franchise for the final 37 games of the 2007 season. Beauchamp left both positions in November 2007 to become manager of the Wichita Wingnuts of the American Association. On July 9, 2008, Beauchamp had a major tirade, taking off his shoe and trying to make the umpire smell his shoe along with his armpit; he received a four-game suspension for his actions. His extreme emotional blowup, arguing the controversial call on behalf of his players, received national attention via major television networks and has become something of an internet sensation. At the end of the 2008 season, the Wingnuts decided not to retain Beauchamp as their manager. Beauchamp was hired as the Arizona Diamondbacks‚Äô Independent League Scout in 2017, and retains that role . In 2018, Beauchamp served as the hitting coach for the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In November 2019, Beauchamp was hired as the hitting coach for the Winnipeg Goldeyes in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.

He was trained by his parents in the principles of Wesleyanism. When little more than four he was brought by his father to Southwark in a trader from Fowey, taking six weeks on the passage. He was educated at the British and Foreign training school, Borough Road, Southwark, and afterwards became its honorary surgeon. When he determined upon a medical career, he was sent to Guy's Hospital, and to the medical school of Edward Grainger in Webb Street, Maze Pond, Southwark. Rendle passed as L.S.A. in 1832 and M.R.C.S. of England in 1838, and in 1873 he became F.R.C.S. For nearly fifty years he practised in Southwark, and from 1856 to 1859 he was Medical Officer of Health for the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. He lived at Treverbyn, Forest Hill, and died there on 18 Sept. 1893, leaving issue four sons and one daughter. Rendle was deeply interested in the borough of Southwark, and engaged in laborious researches into its history. His chief works are : Old Southwark and its People (1878), and The Inns of Old Southwark and Their Associations (1888), the last volume being the joint labour of Rendle and Philip Norman, F.S.A., who revised and rearranged the manuscript materials, drew the more important illustrations, and superintended the publication. Both works contain much original information. Rendle contributed historical sketches to Etchings of Old Southwark, and a paper on the Bankside, Southwark, and the Globe playhouse to Harrison's Description of England for the New Shakspere Society (1877). The last essay was expanded by him in articles in the Antiquarian Magazine. He contributed to the Antiquary papers of Reminiscences chiefly on Southwark, Early Hospitals of Southwark, and Records of St. Thomas's Hospital. Articles by him on three Southwark residents, John Harvard, Alleyn, and Henslowe and on the puritan migration to New England, appeared in the Genealogist.

Maltese Cross trademark Thomas Salt and Co. was a brewery that operated in Burton upon Trent, England, between 1774 and 1927; over 150 years. History =18th century= The brewery was founded in 1774 as Joseph Clay and son by Joseph Clay, described in The \\"British Directory\\" of 1791 as one of the famous \\"nine common brewers of Burton-on-Trent.\\" Joseph Clay came originally from Merrybower, near Derby. When Clay died in 1800, his son Joseph took over and also acquired the Leeson brewery. Joseph Clay junior then opened one of the first banks in Burton, and delegated the brewery management to his maltster, Thomas Salt. He sold out to Salt just before the Napoleonic Blockade of Russia and the Baltic, which led to a dramatic decline in beer exports.'Burton-upon-Trent: Economic history', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 9: Burton-upon-Trent (2003), pp. 53-84. Date accessed: 02 May 2012 Burton brewers had exported large quantities of beer to the Baltic, importing in exchange timber and iron to make the barrels. In ‚ÄúThe Curiosities of Ale and Beer‚Äù, John Bickerdyke records that Thomas Salt is included in the list of brewers in the town records in 1789. According to Bickerdyke, Salt's Maltings were adjacent to Clay's brewery in 1774 and by 1789 Salt had started his own brewery. Thomas Salt later worked Clay's brewery as part of his own brewery at 119 High Street, Burton. =19th century= Prior to 1802 Thomas Salt, Francis Pitt, Edward Marston and John Allen were in partnership as common brewers under the firm of Thomas Salt & Co. In 1802 Edward Marston left the partnership, leaving the other three to continue.The London Gazette Issue 15452 page 144, 9 Feb 1802 In 1804 Thomas Salt passed his share in the company to his son, Thomas Salt the Younger.The London Gazette Issue 15681 page 289, 6 Mar 1804 When Thomas Salt the Younger died in 1813 his son, Thomas Fosbrooke Salt, was only 5 years old. In 1818 the brewery was running in High Street and Susan Salt (widow of Thomas Salt) was also living in High Street. At some point after this the brewery was managed chiefly by Thomas Fosbrooke Salt, under the name Salt and Co. In 1853 Henry Wardle (Thomas Fosbrooke Salt's son- in-law) joined Salt in the business and in due course Salt's sons Edmund and William also became directors. Henry George Tomlinson, who had joined the company as its chemist also joined the board. When pale ale became popular, Salts like other Burton firms responded to the public's changed tastes and Salt's IPA became particularly well-known. The company‚Äôs workforce grew from 194 in 1861 to 400 in 1888 making it one of the major breweries in Burton behind Bass, Worthington, and Samuel Allsopp & Sons. In 1889 Alfred Barnard visited the brewery and included an extensive account in his The noted breweries of Great Britain and Ireland. After Henry Wardle died in 1892, the company became a public limited company. In an era of expansion in the 1890s, the company took over John Bell and the Anchor Brewery. By the end of the century the company had tied houses as far away as Cheltenham and Gloucester. =20th century= In the difficult trading conditions in the first decade of the 20th century, Salts were by 1906 unable to pay interest on sharesThe Advertiser (Adelaide) Saturday 6 January 1906 and tried to effect a merger with Allsopps and the Burton Brewery Company.Sydney Morning Herald 11 June 1906 This was opposed by some of the debenture holders, and the company went into receivership in 1907.Financial Times, 7 June 1907 The company was restructured financially by depriving the Directors of almost all the value of their holdings, but survived until 1927, when it was taken over by Bass for ¬£1,177,773.The Glasgow Herald, Aug 13 1927 References Defunct breweries of the United Kingdom 1774 establishments in England Food and drink companies established in 1774 British companies established in 1774 ","title":"Thomas Salt and Co"},{"id":"12897458","text":"Memecylon clarkeanum is a species of plant in the family Melastomataceae.

This lifestyle has been adopted by animals from separate unrelated taxa. Zooids are multicellular; their structure is similar to that of other solitary animals. The zooids can either be directly connected by tissue (e.g. corals, Catenulida, Siphonophorae, Pyrosome or Ectoprocta) or share a common exoskeleton (e.g. Bryozoa or Pterobranchia). The colonial organism as a whole is called a zoon , plural zoa (from Ancient Greek meaning animal; plural , ). Zooids can exhibit polymorphism. For instance, extant bryozoans may have zooids adapted for different functions, such as feeding, anchoring the colony to the substratum and for brooding embryos. However, fossil bryozoans are only known by the colony structures that the zooids formed during life. There are correlations between the size of some zooids and temperature. Variations in zooid size within colonies of fossils can be used as an indicator of the temperature and the seasonality of seas in the geological past. The term zooid has historically also been used for an organic cell or organized body that has independent movement within a living organism, especially a motile gamete such as a spermatozoon (in the case of algae now zoid), or an independent animal- like organism produced asexually, as by budding or fission.

The use of the ji indicates users identity with Hindu culture and Indian language. Dr Harsh K. Luthar gives examples of ji in Master-ji, Guru-ji, and Mata-ji. The use of ji is also used by Urdu speakers who associate with Indian culture and language.https://luthar.com/2014/05/06/the-meaning-of-the-term-ji-in-the- indian-culture-by-dr-harsh-k-luthar/ Variant spellings * jee ‚Äì Anglicised spelling, common in old publications. * jii ‚Äì example: √Ånandam√∫rtijii, founder of √Ånanda M√°rga. * jiew ‚Äì example: Shankari Mai Jiew in Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi. * joo ‚Äì example: Lakshman Joo of Kashmir. * jiu ‚Äì example: Radha Raman Jiu temples in Bengal (Radha Raman Ji temples in Uttar Pradesh). * jyu * zi/zee - Eastern Bengali pronunciation Usage Ji can mean respect: * With names, e.g. Gandhiji, Rahulji, Modiji, Nehruji, Sant Ji or Shivji * With inanimate objects of respect, e.g. Gangaji or Kailashji * For groups to whom respect is extended, e.g. Guruji, Panditji, Khalsa Ji * To denote respect in any relation, e.g. Mataji, Baba-ji (respected father), Uncle-ji, Behen-ji (respected sister), Devi-ji (respected madam), Bhabhi-Ji (respected sister-in-law) * In conversation, e.g. \\"Ji Nahi\\" (No, said with respect) * In polite conversation, e.g. \\"Navraj Ji\\" (Mr. Navraj, similar to how it would be said in Japanese, Navraj-san) * As a shorthand for yes or to denote respectful attention, \\"Ji\\" * To reassure that a request has been understood and will be complied with, \\"Ji Ji\\" * To respectfully ask for clarification, \\"Ji?\\" (with a questioning tone) * In Parsi (Zoroastrian) names, e.g. in Jamsetji Tata, or Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw Contrast with SƒÅhab SƒÅhab (or sƒÅhib) is always used for an individual, never for an inanimate object or group, though the plural term SƒÅheban exists as well for more than one person. \\"SƒÅhab\\" is also never used as a shorthand to express agreement, disagreement or ask clarification (whereas \\"ji\\" is, such as in Ji, Ji nahi or Ji?). Sometimes, the two terms can be combined to SƒÅhab Ji to indicate a high degree of respect, roughly equivalent to Respected Sir. One important exception where sƒÅhab is used for inanimate objects is in connection with Sikh shrines and scripture, e.g. Harmandir Sahib and Guru Granth Sahib. Contrast with JƒÅn JƒÅn is also a commonly used suffix in the subcontinent, but it (and the variant, JƒÅnƒ´) denotes endearment rather than respect and, in some contexts, can denote intimacy or even a romantic relationship. Due to these connotations of intimacy, the subcontinental etiquette surrounding JƒÅn is more complex than the usage of the same term in Persian, where it is used somewhat more liberally (though even there, restrictions apply). As a standalone term, JƒÅn is the rough equivalent of Darling, and is used almost exclusively for close relatives (such as spouses, lovers and children). In this context, sometimes colloquial forms such as JƒÅnoo and JƒÅnaa, or combination words such as JƒÅneman (my darling) and JƒÅnejaan/JƒÅnejaana (roughly, love of my life), are also used. When used with a name or a relation-term, it means dear. So, bhƒÅi-sƒÅhab and bhƒÅi-ji carry the meaning of respected brother, whereas bhƒÅi-jƒÅn or bhaiyya-jƒÅnƒ´ mean dear brother. The term meri jƒÅn, roughly meaning my dear, can be used with friends of the same gender, or in intimate relationships with the opposite gender. In subcontinental etiquette, while bhaijan can be used by males to denote a brotherly relation with any other male of a roughly similar age including total strangers (the female equivalent between women is apajan or didijan), meri jƒÅn is used only with friends with whom informality has been established. Ji, on the other hand, is appropriate in all these situations and across genders because it carries no connotations of intimacy. Popular conflation with the letter 'G' Because English usage is widespread in the Indian subcontinent, the fact that the honorific Ji is pronounced identically to the letter G is used extensively in puns. This is sometimes deliberately exploited in consumer marketing, such as with the popular \\"Parle-G Biscuits\\" (where the 'G' ostensibly stands for Glucose), which sounds like Parle Ji Biscuits (or, the respected Parle biscuits). A pun popular with children in North India and Pakistan consists entirely of English letters - BBG T PO G, which is pronounced very similarly to Bibi-ji, Tea pi-o ji (meaning, respected ma'am, please have some tea). Some people also add an 'A' or 'O' to this pun as a prefix to give effect as if a person is calling the Bibi-ji, in a typical Indian friendly way used in regional slangs. Thus we may also write it as O BBG T PO G. One may even add the answer of Bibi-ji as PKIG, means I just had the tea. It has been known for a Bengali name ending in -ji to be rendered in Sanskrit as -opadhyay (-a-upƒÅdhyƒÅya with sandhi, i.e. Mukherjee and Mukhopadhyay). \\"UpƒÅdhyƒÅya\\" is Sanskrit for \\"teacher\\".

A California native, he attended Michigan State Normal School from 1886 to 1888 and began playing professional baseball with the Oakland Colonels in 1890. After winning the California League batting title in 1890, he played in Major League Baseball for Cap Anson's Chicago Colts from 1892 to 1894. He played six seasons from 1894 to 1899 for the Detroit Tigers of the Western League, led the team in batting each year, hit .447 in 1894, .424 in 1895, .372 in 1897, and won the Western League batting title in 1899. In 1900, he played for the Kansas City Blues of the newly established American League, compiling a .350 batting average to become the first American League batting champion. In 1901, the American League became a major league, and Dungan hit .320 (10th best in the league) for the Washington Senators. He concluded his professional baseball career playing for the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association (1902‚Äì1903) and Memphis Egyptians of the Southern Association (1903‚Äì1905). After retiring from baseball, Dungan returned to Orange County, California, where he lived for the rest of his life, having homes in Laguna Beach and Santa Ana. He was an orange grower and owned property in Talbert (now known as Fountain Valley) and Lemon Heights (now known as North Tustin). He died in 1939 at age 72. Early years Dungan was born in 1866 in Ferndale in Humboldt County, California. He was the son of boat builder Robert M. Dungan and Joanna (Jenkins) Dungan. The family moved to Los Angeles County in 1877 and eventually settled in a section of Orange County (between southern Santa Ana and Fountain Valley) known as \\"Gospel Swamp\\". From 1886 to 1888, Dungan attended the Michigan State Normal School (later renamed Eastern Michigan University) in Ypsilanti, Michigan. When he returned from college, he played baseball for a team in Fairview, California, starting in July 1888. In 1889, he played for baseball teams in Pasadena, San Bernardino, and San Diego. Professional baseball =San Diego and Oakland= After starting the 1890 with San Diego, Dungan joined the Oakland Colonels in March 1890. Oakland manager T.P. Robinson said at the time, \\"I believe Dungan is the best hitter we've ever had here.\\" After one of his first games with the club, The San Francisco Call described him as \\"a great outfielder\\" and \\"a vicious hitter\\". He finished the season with a .332 batting average, 174 hits, 159 runs scored, and 65 stolen bases in 533 at bats. He was the batting champion of the California League with an average 17 points higher than any other player. =Milwaukee and Omaha= Dungan began the 1891 season with the Milwaukee Brewers of the Western League. In late July, the Omaha club was reorganized, and each team in the league was required to release a number of players to the Omaha club. Milwaukee released Dungan to Omaha. =Chicago= In 1892, Dungan made it the major leagues with Cap Anson's Chicago Colts of the National League. He appeared in 113 games as an outfielder for the 1892 Colts and compiled a .284 batting average with 19 doubles, 7 triples, and 15 stolen bases. Dungan remained with the Colts in 1893, appearing in 107 games as an outfielder, raising his batting average to .297 with 23 doubles and 7 triples. His 138 hits in 1893 was second to Bill Dahlen on the 1893 Colts. Dungan appeared in 10 games for the Colts in 1894, and his batting average dropped to .231 in 46 plate appearances. He was farmed out to the Detroit team in the Western League and then traded to the Louisville Colonels for pitcher Scott Stratton. He appeared in 10 games for the Colonels in 1894, compiling a .344 batting average in 37 plate appearances. =Detroit= In July 1894, Dungan rejoined the Detroit club of the Western League (known as the Creams in 1894 and the Tigers thereafter) after being released by Louisville. Dungan was popular in Detroit from the start. On July 12, when he made his return to the club following his stint in Louisville, Dungan was greeted warmly by the Detroit fans. The Detroit Free Press wrote: > The feature of the game was the reappearance of Sam Dungan in a Detroit > uniform. On the third base bleacher fence was a banner, \\"Welcome home. This > push is for Dungan.\\" Behind it were a dozen or more men armed with horns, > which they used heroically at times. . . . Dungan marched up to the plate. > He was cheered to the echo and displayed a small portion of his shiny skull > in recognition of the applause. Then a man advanced and handed him a floral > bat from some local admirers and the yelling was louder than ever. [Dungan > then hit an inside-the-park home run.] Men and women arose and cheered the > sturdy fielder, players slapped him on the back, and the horns on the > bleachers testified that there wasn't a happier \\"push\\" in the whole town. During the 1894 season, Dungan compiled a .447 batting average for Detroit, 76 points higher than the second best hitter on the club. Dungan remained with the Detroit baseball club for six years from 1894 to 1899 and appeared in every game played by the club from 1895 to 1899. He led Detroit in batting in 1894 (.447), 1895 (.424),(Dungan's .425 average was 76 points higher than the second best batter, Nicholson.) 1897 (.372), 1898 (.325), and 1899 (.347). He won the Western League batting championship in 1899, and finished second in 1894, third in 1895, sixth in 1897, and fourth in 1898. Though generally not considered to be a great defensive outfielder, he also led all outfielders in the league with 42 assists in 1896. During the 1897 season, Detroit teammate Harry Steinfeldt developed bad shins from being hit by the ball. Dungan gave Steinfeldt football shin guards to wear under his socks, which helped the shins heal. One of Detroit's catchers then began using the shin guards, and Dungan was later credited as the person who introduced the use of shin guards to baseball. Roger Bresnahan also claimed credit for the innovation, but Dungan noted that Bresnahan was pitching in the minor leagues when Dungan introduced the device. In July 1897, Dungan was arrested for alienating the affections of the wife of Dr. W. D. MacQuisten. MacQuisten withdrew the criminal charges two days later. =Chicago and Kansas City= Dungan returned to Chicago briefly in 1900, appearing in six games and compiling a .267 batting average. On May 17, 1900, he was traded to Kansas City Blues of the newly established American League as part of a trade that sent John Ganzel to Chicago in exchange for Dungan, Bill Phyle, and Bill Everitt. Dungan played first base appeared in 112 games for Kansas City during the 1900 season. He compiled a .350 batting average, reported in some sources as .337, best in the American League among players with at least 50 games played. He is remembered as the first American League batting champion. =Washington= In 1901, as the American League gained recognition as a major league, .320 batting average, the Kansas City Blues became the Washington Senators. Dungan appeared in 138 games for the 1901 Senators, 104 as an outfielder and 35 as a first baseman. He compiled a .320 batting average, 10th highest in the American League. His tally of 179 hits in 1901 was fifth highest in the league. He appeared in his last major league game on September 27, 1901, at age 35. =Milwaukee and Memphis= Dungan remained active in professional baseball for four more years, playing for the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association (1902‚Äì1903) and Memphis Egyptians of the Southern Association (1903‚Äì1905). He compiled a .342 batting average in his first season with Memphis. He helped Memphis win Southern Association championships in 1903 and 1904, but saw his batting average drop to .288 in 1904 and .286 in 1905. In 1902, Dungan reportedly discovered Gavvy Cravath were playing a game of Sunday ball in Southern California. Dungan set up a tryout for Cravath with Jim Morley of the Los Angeles Angels. Cravath went on to lead the National League six times in RBIs. Dungan announced his retirement from baseball in January 1906 at age 39. Dungan later recalled: \\"I was fed up on baseball although I had one of my best years in 1905. I made up my mind I didn't want to follow the game indefinitely, limping from one place to another as my ability declined. And I had no managerial aspirations. So I just up and quit.\\" Family and later years During the 1890 season in Oakland, Dungan became acquainted with Mamie Bodgard, a fan of the Oakland club. The two were married in Los Angeles in March 1891. However, Dungan left her two hours after the ceremony, reportedly after discovering that she had previously been married and widowed. Dungan's flight from his bride became the subject of newspaper stories published across the country. The marriage ended in divorce; sources are in dispute as to whether Bodgard's request for alimony was granted or denied. In 1900, Dungan was married to Laura B. Lippy. They had two children, Dorothy Eleanor and Myron Robert. Daughter Dorothy was married to Herbert H. Baker in 1933. After retiring from baseball, Dungan returned to his home town of Santa Ana, California, where he was employed as a rancher and citrus grower. He had purchased 20 acres of land in Talbert, California (now known as Fountain Valley), in 1893; he leased the land for farming of potatoes, celery, beets, and beans. In 1907, Dungan also built a cottage home in Laguna Beach where he lived for several years. He also bought 12 acres in Lemon Heights (now known as North Tustin) in 1912. In 1917, he built a house at 221 South Broadway in Santa Ana, where he lived for the rest of his life. Dungan's wife, Laura, died in December 1928 at their home in Stana Ana. Dungan remarried in September 1933 to Lula Mary Lewis. In March 1939, Dungan died at his home in Santa Ana. The cause of his death was a heart attack that followed uremic poisoning. He was buried at Fairhaven Cemetery (now known as Santa Ana Cemetery). He left his estate in equal shares to his widow, Lulu Mary, and two children.

History  The diamond citron of Santa Maria del Cedro was one of the most important varieties candied by the largest factories at Livorno, Italy; it was gathered from Liguria, Naples, Calabria & Sicily and then shipped into England and the United States.The Cultivated Oranges and Lemons *The Pharmaceutical Journal-Consular report *The Gardeners Chronicle * Biennial Report * Report Google Books *Parliamentary Papers * The Dublin REview * Monthly Consular * Bulletin Victoria * Science = Association with Genoa = Many religious Jews call it Yanova Esrog (Genoa citron), because of a long association of the fruit with the trading port of Genoa in northern Italy, that exported it to other countries.

Therefore, the Calabrian citron is also considered to be of oldest Ashkenazic tradition for the Jewish ritual during the Feast of Tabernacles.Oekonomische Encyklop√§die * Trait√© du citrus By Giorgio Gallesio * Manuale di arboricoltura by Giuseppe Antonio * Enciclopedia di scienze politiche * The Gardener's Monthly and Horticulturist * Descrizione di Genova e del Genovesato * Lettere sopra i buccheri * Dell'idioma e della letteratura genovese graft union, one at the stem and one at the branch. Most adherent to the diamante variety of Calabria are still the Chabad's, whose late Rabbis were always in support of this traditional variety, even claiming by virtue of a legend that Moses himself obtained his esrog from this location.Why an Italian Etrog Among the other Hasidic sects, it is most used by the Satmars.  Kashrus supervision  The citron in Calabria was celebrated by poets like Byron and D'Annunzio, but is only saved from extinction thanks to the Jewish tradition.Discovery Jewish Italy ‚Äì academy article While Calabria is at the southern point of Italy, and its climate most Mediterranean, it is the most suitable for the citron. Even though, during the winter it is still too cold for the citron; this is why the farmers need to protect them with blue or green plastic covers. Most of the citron trees in the area are grafted onto foreign citrus rootstock, in order to save them from frost and disease. This practice renders their fruits non-kosher for the Sukkot ritual, and therefore in order for a mashgiach to certify a citron as kosher, he must first carefully inspect the tree to confirm it was not grafted. A Jewish delegation comes from Israel to Santa Maria del Cedro every year between July and August to choose the best fruit to be used in the holiday for the Jewish community. The selection of the best fruit is a virtual ritual. The mashgichim, each followed by a worker carrying a box and a pair of scissors, go to the citron farms at five in the morning. The mashgiach proceeds slowly looking left and right. Then he stops and looks at the base of the tree, right where the trunk comes up from the ground. A smooth trunk means the tree has not been grafted and the fruit can be picked. The mashgiach lies down on the ground to examine better the lower branches between the leaves. Each Tree is inspected for Grafting signs. Once the good fruit is found, the mashgiach shows it to the worker who cuts it off leaving a piece of the stalk. Then the mashgiach analyses the picked citron one more time and if he decides it is worthy he wraps it in oakum and puts it in the box. The farmer receives the agreed sum for each picked fruit. Then the boxes are sealed and sent to the Lamezia Terme International Airport with a final destination Tel Aviv.Ansa Mediterraneo- RELIGION ROME JEWISH LEADERS VISIT COSENZA CITRON FARMS Although diamante is also growing in Puerto Rico, Sicily and Sardinia, their citrons are not used for the Jewish ritual, since no kashrut certification was present at transplantation. Seeds and cuttings of inspected trees were planted in the Israeli village of Kfar Chabad, with the hechsher certification by major kashrut organizations. The methods for tree checking to verify if the tree is grafted or not, were established by a board of rabbis in Israel by 1877 as described in Kuntres Pri Etz Hadar which was published in Jerusalem a year after.

Antonov, who worked as a Rome-based representative for Balkan Airlines, Bulgaria's national airline, was arrested in 1981 by Italian authorities and charged with complicity after the assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II by Turkish national Aƒüca on May 13, 1981. Pope John Paul II was seriously wounded but survived the shooting. Antonov was placed on trial in Italy with three Turks and two other Bulgarians for the attack against the Pope. Aƒüca named Antonov as his co-conspirator before his conviction for attempted murder. The case against Antonov fell apart. Italian prosecutors could not prove that the Bulgarian secret service had hired Aƒüca to assassinate the Pope at the behest of the Soviet Union, which feared the Polish Pope's influence in Communist Eastern Europe. Antonov was acquitted of the charges in 1986 following a two- year trial. The Italian court said that there was not enough evidence to support a conviction. Antonov returned to Bulgaria following his acquittal. He refused to speak publicly about his time in prison. His mental and physical health rapidly declined and he spent rest of his life in isolation from others. Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov called for a legal exoneration of Antonov's reputation in 2000 saying that it was \\"important for the sake of clearing Bulgaria's image.\\" Pope John Paul II made his first and only official visit to Bulgaria in 2002. The Pope publicly rejected the allegations that Bulgaria's Communist government had been behind his 1981 attack and never believed in the Bulgarian connection.

Born into slavery, Albius became an important figure in the cultivation of vanilla. At the age of 12, he invented a technique for pollinating vanilla orchids quickly and profitably. Albius' technique revolutionized the cultivation of vanilla and made it possible to profitably grow vanilla beans away from their native Mexico. Early life Albius was born in St. Suzanne, R√©union. His mother, a slave, died during his birth. The colonist keeping Edmond in slavery was F√©r√©ol Bellier Beaumont. Vanilla pollination French colonists brought vanilla beans to R√©union and nearby Mauritius in the 1820s with the hope of starting production there. However, the vines were sterile because no insect would pollinate them. In the 1830s, Charles Morren, a professor of botany at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium, developed a method of hand-pollinating vanilla, but his technique was slow and required too much effort to make cultivating vanilla a moneymaking proposition.Hazen J (1995) Vanilla. Chronicle Books. San Francisco, CA. In 1841, Albius invented a method to quickly pollinate the vanilla orchid using a thin stick or blade of grass and a simple thumb gesture. Using the stick or grass blade, field hands lift the rostellum, the flap that separates the male anther from the female stigma, and then, with their thumbs, smear the sticky pollen from the anther over the stigma. Albius‚Äô manual pollination method is still used today, as nearly all vanilla is pollinated by hand. After Albius‚Äôs discovery, R√©union became for a time the world's largest supplier of vanilla. French colonists used Albius' technique in Madagascar to cultivate vanilla, and Madagascar remains the world's chief vanilla producer.Rain P (1986) The Vanilla Cookbook. Celestial Arts. Berkeley, CA. Later life In 1848, France outlawed slavery in its colonies, and Albius left the plantation for St. Denis, where he worked as a kitchen servant. He was convicted of stealing jewelry and sentenced to ten years in prison, but the sentence was commuted after five years when the governor granted him clemency in light of his enormous contribution to vanilla production in R√©union. Albius died in poverty in St. Suzanne in 1880.

In creative partnership with his spouse, Ray Kaiser Eames, he was responsible for groundbreaking contributions in the field of architecture, furniture design, industrial design, manufacturing and the photographic arts.  Biography  = Childhood = Charles was born in St. Louis to Charles Eames Sr., a railway security officer, and Marie Adele Celine Eames (n√©e Lambert) on June 17, 1907. He had one elder sibling, a sister called Adele. Charles attended Yeatman High School and developed an early interest in architecture and photography. = Education = Charles studied architecture at Washington University in St. Louis on an architecture scholarship. After two years of study, he left the university. Many sources claim that he was dismissed for his advocacy of Frank Lloyd Wright and his interest in modern architects. The university reportedly dropped him because of his \\"too modern\\" views. Other sources, less frequently cited, note that while a student, Charles Eames was also employed as an architect at the firm of Trueblood and Graf. The demands on his time from this employment and his classes led to sleep-deprivation and diminished performance at the university. = First marriage = While at Washington University, he met his first wife, Catherine Woermann, whom he married in 1929. A year later, they had a daughter, Lucia Dewey Eames. Charles and Catherine were married for over a decade and their divorce was finalized in early 1941. = Early architectural practice = In 1930, Charles began his own architectural practice in St. Louis with partner Charles Gray. They were later joined by a third partner, Walter Pauley. * Sweetzer House, St. Louis, Missouri, 1931 * St. Mary's Church, Helena, Arkansas, 1934 * St. Mary‚Äôs Catholic Church, Paragould, Arkansas, 1935 * Meyer House, Huntleigh, Missouri, 1936-1938 * Dinsmoor House, St. Louis, Missouri, 1936 * Dean House, St. Louis, Missouri, 1936 Charles Eames was greatly influenced by the Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen (whose son Eero, also an architect, would become a partner and friend). = Cranbrook and the beginning of furniture design = Lounge chair and ottoman by Charles Eames (1955) At the elder Saarinen's invitation, Charles moved in 1938 with his wife Catherine and daughter Lucia to Michigan to further study architecture at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. Charles quickly became an instructor and the head of the industrial design department. In order to apply for the Architecture and Urban Planning Program, Eames defined an area of focus‚Äîthe St. Louis waterfront. Together with Eero Saarinen he designed prize- winning furniture for New York's Museum of Modern Art \\"Organic Design in Home Furnishings\\" competition.Eliot F. Noyes. Organic Design in Home Furnishings. Museum of Modern Art. 1941. He met Ray Kaiser during this project; she was a student at Cranbrook and helped with graphic design. Eames and Saarinen's work displayed the new technique of wood molding (originally developed by Alvar Aalto), that Charles would further develop with Ray in many moulded plywood products, including: chairs and other furniture, and splints and stretchers for the US Navy during World War II.Alexandra Griffith Winton. Charles Eames (1907‚Äì78) and Ray Eames (1912‚Äì88) . The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Accessed 12 December 2007. = Ray Kaiser = In 1941, Charles and Catherine divorced, and soon after, he married his Cranbrook colleague Ray Kaiser. He relocated with her to Los Angeles, California during their honeymoon, where they worked and lived together until their deaths. Together, Charles and Ray Eames internationally became two of the most recognized and celebrated designers of the 20th century.  The Eames House  Three years after arriving in Los Angeles, Charles and Ray were asked to participate in the Case Study House Program, a housing program sponsored by Arts & Architecture magazine in the hopes of showcasing examples of economically-priced modern homes that utilized wartime and industrial materials. John Entenza, the owner and editor of Arts & Architecture magazine, recognized the importance of Charles and Ray‚Äôs thinking and design practices‚Äîalongside becoming a close friend of the couple. Charles and Eero Saarinen were hired to design Case Study House number 8, which would be the residence of Charles and Ray, and Case Study House number 9, which would house John Entenza, in 1945. The two homes (alongside other Case Study houses) would share a five-acre parcel of land in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood north of Santa Monica, which overlooked the Pacific Ocean. Because of post-war material rationing, the materials ordered for the first draft of the Eames House (called ‚Äúthe Bridge House‚Äù) were backordered. Charles and Ray spent many days and nights on-site in the meadow picnicking, shooting arrows, and socializing with family, friends, and coworkers. They learned of their love for the eucalyptus grove, the expanse of land, and the unobstructed view of the ocean. They made the decision to not build the Bridge House and instead reconfigured the materials to create two separate structures nestled into the property‚Äôs hillside. Eero Saarinen had no part in this second draft of the Eames House; it was a full collaboration between Charles and Ray. The materials were finally delivered and the house was erected from February through December 1949. The Eameses moved in on Christmas Eve and it became their only residence for the remainder of their lives. It remains a milestone of modern architecture operated by the Eames Foundation, a non-profit organization instituted by Lucia Eames. The Eames Office designed a few more pieces of architecture, many of which were never put into fruition. The Herman Miller Showroom on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles was built in 1950 and the De Pree House was constructed in Zeeland, Michigan for the founder of Herman Miller‚Äôs son, Max De Pree, and his growing family. Unbuilt projects include the Billy Wilder House, the prefabricated kit home known as the Kwikset House, and a national aquarium.  The Eames Office  From 1943 until his death in 1978, Charles and Ray worked together with a team of staff and produced an unparalleled breadth of creative design work across many disciplines.  Death  Charles Eames died of a heart attack on August 21, 1978, while on a consulting trip in his native Saint Louis. He was buried in the Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis. He now has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.  Philosophy  In 1970 and 1971, Charles Eames gave the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University. At the lectures, the Eames viewpoint and philosophy are related through Charles' own telling of what he called \\"the banana leaf parable\\", a banana leaf being the most basic eating utensil in southern India. He related the progression of design and its process where the banana leaf is transformed into something fantastically ornate. He explains the next step and ties it to the design process by finishing the parable with:  References  1907 births 1978 deaths Artists from St. Louis American filmmakers American architects American designers Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts alumni ","title":"Charles Eames"},{"id":"12897802","text":"Meriania ampla is a species of plant in the family Melastomataceae.

It is specialized in high quality long and special carbon steel products. In 2005 the Russian steel and mining company Severstal became the majority shareholder (approx 60%) of Lucchini, the remainder being owned by Lucchini Family (30%) and other minor shareholders. In 2007, Lucchini family bought back Lucchini RS, the part of Lucchini Group active in the railway rolling stock business. The two companies are therefore totally independent. In 2010, Severstal acquired all the shares of Lucchini Group from Lucchini family and became the only shareholder of the company. History The Group's founder and former Honorary President Luigi Lucchini expanded and developed his father's business of crafting iron at Casto, Italy by building a small rolling mill to produce rebar during the period after World War II. Over the years, the craftsmanship was replaced by industry, investing in more and more productive rolling mills and building the first electric arc furnaces to melt scrap and transform it into steel ingots, ready for rolling. During this period Lucchini played a role within the Italian steel industry making a name for itself through unyielding determination. In the 1970s and 1980s, Lucchini Group forecasted market evolution and progressively widened its product range to include added value products through investment and acquisition. Through privatization, the group entered the integral cycle technology, widened its product range, invested its resources in R&D; sector, set an increasing attention onto customer service and developed the internationalization process. In 2005, following a financial restructuring due to important investments in the plants, the majority of Lucchini Group was acquired by the Russian group Severstal, through a capital increase. In 2007, the railway rolling stock division, Lucchini RS was sold back to Lucchini family. In 2012, the French division Ascometal was sold to Apollo Private Equity Fund. In 2013, Lucchini filed for bankruptcy. Facilities Lucchini has multiple domestic and international facilities. The main facility in Italy is in Piombino (active since 1908 and acquired by Lucchini in 1992); there are also facilities in Trieste (established by the Austrian Krainische Industrie Gesellschaft in 1896 and acquired by Lucchini in 1995), Condove, Lecco.

She won the 1974 Kate Greenaway Medal from the Library Association for her book The Wind Blew. On screen she was best known as the owner of the 'Ragdoll boat' in the long- running children's series Rosie and Jim. Hutchins was married to illustrator Laurence Hutchins, with two children. She wrote books for early readers that he illustrated.  Biography  Hutchins was born 18 June 1942 in Yorkshire, the sixth of seven children. She won a scholarship to Darlington School of Art in 1958, continued studying illustration at Leeds College of Art in 1960, and graduated in 1962. She worked for an advertising agency in London to 1966 when she married Laurence Hutchins and moved to New York City for two years. There she worked on writing and illustrating her first picture book, Rosie's Walk, published in 1968 by The Bodley Head and Macmillan US. In the United States, it was a runner-up for the Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award and the librarians named it a 1968 ALA Notable Book. It remains her work most widely catalogued by WorldCat participating libraries. Titch and its sequels were noted for drawing on Hutchins' family life for its depiction of a sibling relationship. Pat Hutchins wrote novels for early readers, some illustrated by husband Laurence, and more than two dozen picture books. Beside winning the 1974 Greenaway Medal, she was a commended runner up for One-Eyed Jack (1979), another book she wrote and illustrated. In 1995, Hutchins took over from John Cunliffe as the presenter of the British children's television series, Rosie and Jim. She played the role of an artistic narrowboat owner and illustrator, referred to as Loopy Lobes by the two puppet characters on account of the large and elaborate earrings she wore during her tenure. Hutchins appeared in 45 episodes over two series and subsequently illustrated books for the franchise. Hutchins died from cancer on 8 November 2017 at the age of 75.  Selected works  Hutchins has both written and illustrated about fifty books. * Rosie's Walk (The Bodley Head, 1968) * Tom and Sam (Bodley, 1969) * Changes, Changes (Bodley, 1971) * Titch (Bodley, 1971) * Good Night, Owl (New York: Macmillan, 1972; Bodley, 1973) * The Silver Christmas Tree (Bodley, 1974) * The Wind Blew (The Bodley Head, 1974) ‚ÄîGreenaway Medal winner * Don't Forget the Bacon!

He played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball between 1921 and 1934, playing in 1921-24 for the St. Louis Browns and 1927-34 for the Cincinnati Reds.  Career  Ray Kolp played baseball as a youth (with the nickname \\"Jack\\") on New Berlin town teams and on the Electric Suction Sweepers, a team sponsored by the sweeper manufacturer that became the Hoover Company in 1922. Playing as \\"Ray Culp\\" for unclear contract-related reasons, he was a pitcher and shortstop for the Akron Numatics in 1920 in the minor's International League with famous teammate Jim Thorpe. In March 1921, Kolp was invited to a St. Louis Browns' tryout camp for pitchers and made the team to start his major league career. Early on, he seemed to have a jinx over the Cleveland Indians, beating them repeatedly, including his first trip to a big league mound on April 16,1921. Over his career, Ray Kolp was a good pitcher, but never a great pitcher. He had an average fastball and mixed it with a sidearm pitch and various spinners. The most games he won in a season was 14 with the Browns in 1922. His overall major league won-loss record is 79-95. He gave up two home runs to Babe Ruth in one game in New York on August 5, 1923. Ray Kolp was a stylish dresser with an assertive personality. On the field, Ray Kolp was cocky and vociferous, often taunting and scoffing at opposing players and advising umpires from both the pitching mound and dugout. He was an adept needler. His baiting harassment made him a famous bench jockey, even in those days of unruly and emotional baseball. Ray Kolp is most remembered for an incident in 1929 involving future Hall-of-Famer Hack Wilson. The episode occurred in the day's second game; in an earlier game there had been a triple play, which may explain why feelings were running high. Hack Wilson was on first with Ray Kolp in the Cincinnati dugout shouting taunts and insults as usual. Having endured enough, Hack charged off the field into the opposing dugout where he clobbered Ray Kolp in the jaw. A near-riot ensued in the stands, with the police needed to finally restore order. That evening, the two teams met up again at the train station, where Hack Wilson punched Ray's teammate Pete Donnohue. League president Heydler personally investigated the particulars of the attacks, declaring Hack the culprit and fining him $100. These shenanigans produced headlines for days in sports sections across the U.S. Ray Kolp played four years with the St. Louis Browns, spent two years in the minors in Minnesota with the St. Paul Saints, and then returned to the majors with the Cincinnati Reds in 1927. His last game in the majors was with the Reds on September 21, 1934. Two years later he received an engraved silver lifetime pass from major league baseball in recognition of his 12 years of big league service. Following the majors, Kolp pitched in the minors for the Minneapolis Millers for two years and then became their first base coach. He was the manager of the Williamsport Grays in Pennsylvania for two seasons, 1944 and 1945, handling a mostly Cuban team playing as replacements for the GIs at war. He led the team in promoting War Bonds, raising pledges for $231,000 in 1944. His only son, Richard C. Kolp pitched in the minors for the Paducah Indians in Kentucky in 1939 and 1940. Ray Kolp died in Cincinnati, Ohio on July 29, 1967. Ray and his wife Bertha Willett Kolp of Coalport, Pennsylvania, are buried in St. Stephen Cemetery in Fort Thomas, Kentucky.

A skilled gunfighter, Bonner is an idealistic person who prefers peaceful resolutions of conflict wherever possible. He is gregarious, intelligent, and public-spirited. The half-hour black-and-white program aired 78 episodes. The Restless Gun theme song (officially titled \\"I Ride With the Wind\\") begins: \\"I ride with the wind, my eyes on the sun, and my hand on my restless gun...\\" The song composer is probably Paul Dunlap, credited as the primary series composer, but could have been contributed to by either of the two other series composers, Dave Kahn and Stanley Wilson. Two versions (one a vocal) are currently posted on YouTube, but neither posting lists any composer or performance credits. Background John Payne as Vint Bonner and villain Gene Baroda: The dual role in the 1959 episode \\"Dead Ringer\\" ended with a shootout between his two characters. Broadcast on March 29, 1957, as an installment of the CBS anthology series The Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, the pilot episode was based on a radio series The Six Shooter, with Payne's character named Britt Ponset. For the television version, however, the name was changed to Vint Bonner. Some episodes were based on the radio programs. The principal producer of The Restless Gun was David Dortort, thereafter in 1959 the executive producer of NBC's blockbuster Western hit Bonanza. Dortort did not create The Restless Gun, nor did he produce the pilot episode, and he rarely contributed original scripts. A critic who considers The Restless Gun only an average program, writes that the series \\"probably owes its mediocrity more to MCA, the company that 'packaged' the series and produced it through its television arm Revue Productions, than to Dortort.\\" The Restless Gun ranked in the top ten during its first season on the air, ending the year at number eight, but it was not among the highest- rated programs in the second season.A. C. Nielsen Media Research, 1957-1958 television seasonThe number-9 show that year was Spring Byington's December Bride on CBS, which also aired on Monday evenings. Set in Texas, The Restless Gun pilot episode features Andrew Duggan, William Hopper, and Michael Landon in supporting roles. Hopper plays a former lawman from Laredo in South Texas and long-time friend of Bonner's. Hopper's character is being sought for revenge by Duggan, whom the lawman had sent to prison. In the episode, Bonner speaks of taking a job near Waco.Pilot episode (1957), The Restless Gun, DVD, Timeless Media Group Most end titles of The Restless Gun episodes have a line that reads \\"Based on characters created by Frank Burt\\", but Burt's name is not mentioned in the pilot episode. Though he is not listed as the \\"creator\\" of the TV series, Burt was the creator of the radio series on which The Restless Gun was based. Payne is the \\"executive producer\\" of his series, but a critic calls that designation \\"vanity\\". Payne has sometimes been compared to actor Dick Powell, who during that same period hosted and sometimes starred in his own CBS Western anthology series, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater during the second half of the 1950s.

It looks at the complex scenario within which a brother-sister relationship goes through.  Plot  The story is based on the life of Nandini, who is torn between love and duty towards her brother, Raja. The dilemma is who should she abandon - the love of her husband or her loving brother? Besides that as the story progresses, Bhai Raja marries a girl name Neelima. But Neelima's brother Aaryan and grandmother are unhappy with her marriage with Bhai Raja because Bhai Raja didn't allow his sister Nandini to get marry to Aaryan. Now Neelima's grandma wants to separate Bhai Raja and Neelima because of how Raja insulted her. So she sends Neelima's best friend (Nisha and her sister Nikita) to take revenge from Bhai Raja. The first plan which is Nisha will have a friend bring liquid in the house and spray it on Raja knowing that Raja won't like it and will bring up a big scene but Neelima stands up for him and the plan goes totally flop. So Nisha meets Neelima's grandmother at a swimming pool Raja and Neelima are there too because Raja's friend was going to meet them there. They see Nisha they are just about to go to her table when they meet Raja's friend. Nisha rushes home. Ambar and Nikita have just come home from shopping buying everyone gifts and Gunjan (Raja's Younger sister) wears western clothing but everyone except Neelima laughs. Neelima make Gunjan happy. The only reason Gunjan wants to be like Nikita is because Ambar likes Nikita but Gunjan likes him and Ambar hates her. Then Gunjan curls her hair and wears western when Fatima Bi starts yelling at her but Neelima tells Fatima Bi that every girl wants to do all this so let her and Neelima gives her a makeup set. Nisha is watching everything. Nisha calls Nikita she's at a club with Ambar and Nikita is just faking to love Ambar. They eventually leave after Neelima finds out Nikki was working with Aryan to get information on the family. Amber and Gunjan one night slept together which resulted in Gunjan becoming pregnant. At this point in the story, Raja Amber and Nandini's father has come back into the picture after a long absence. He instigates Amber into hating Gunjan. After everyone in the family discovers what happened between the two of them, Raja gets Amber and Gunjan married. But Amber vows to Gunjan that he will never love her. As time goes on, he still won't come close to Gunjan and she is unhappy but won't say anything because she knows it will hurt the family. After a failed attempt at marriage again, Nandini is now married to her friend Prince. Nobody was happy at first about this secret wedding, but than everyone deals with it and eventually become okay with it. Meanwhile Price's older sister, Kadambari, is only interested in the fact that Nandini comes from a wealthy family; and so she wants Balraj's money. She makes side comments to Nandini saying how they are poor and how she doesn't have any money so she can make Nandini feel bad. Kadambari burned down her own house so she could go live with Raja and live the life of a rich woman. No matter how much she tries, Kadambari still doesn't get what she wants. Nandini and her in-laws are still living with Raja and has said they will stay there permanently. Neelima is now pregnant and Raja is adamant on giving their first born to Nandini who was left barren from an accident. Nandini keeps telling Raja she does not want to have their child because she knows Neelima does not want to give her child up. This issue is creating a big problem in the house until we find out Nandini is \\"pregnant\\". Everyone in the family is so happy because three children will be born in their house. Before Nandini announces she is \\"pregnant\\" she had discussed the option of surrogacy with Prince who was against the idea. Nandini had said that was the only way to keep the family happy and to stop Raja from giving his child to her. Nandini couldn't find a surrogate right away so she announces that she is pregnant. Although everyone thinks it is a miracle, the truth is she lied to she could have some time to find a surrogate. No one knows this except Prince. Now Nellima is in a coma after fighting over something. A five-year leap happens Pari Nelima's daughter thinks that Nandini is her mother and Prince is her father. BR says he will meet Neelima and comes home. Everyone else leaves. BR tells Neelima that he is in a dilemma, since Prince is getting such a big opportunity and on the other hand Pari and Nandini will have to go with him. What should he do? He gets a flash where Neelima had told him that she would want her child to get the love of both her parents. BR comes back to see Nandini feeding pari, how she takes care of her. BR is in his room and thinks how will he separate from Nandini as well. We see that Nandini and prince are packing, and then they meet everyone and leave for Dubai. Pari come and asks BR where they are going. BR says Dubai, Pari runs after Nandini and Prince who are in the car. BR follows. Pari has an accident. BR comes out of the nightmare. Prince is talking on the phone and saying that he cannot go to Dubai because of some family problems. BR says he will go to Dubai. BR convinces prince and Nandini to go. Prince says that, but he has to go for three years. BR and Nandini are shocked.

It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the Himalayan cuckoo (C. saturatus), with the name 'Oriental cuckoo' used for the combined species. Differences in voice and size suggest that it should be treated as a separate species.King, Ben (2005) The taxonomic status of the three subspecies of Cuculus saturatus. Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club, 125 (1):48-55 The binomial name Cuculus horsfieldi has often been used instead of Cuculus optatus, but is now usually considered to be a junior synonym.Peterson, Alan P. (ed.) (1999) Zoological Nomenclature Resource (Zoonomen). Accessed 22/08/07. Description It is 30-32 centimetres long with a wingspan of 51-57 centimetres and a weight of 73-156 grams. The adult male has a grey head, breast and upperparts. The belly is creamy-white with dark bars. The vent is frequently buff with few markings. The legs and feet are orange-yellow and there is a bare yellow ring around the eye. Adult females and juveniles occur in two morphs. The grey morph is similar to the male but has a brownish wash on the breast. The rufous morph is reddish-brown above, paler on the underparts and with strong dark barring all over including the rump. The common cuckoo (C. canorus) is very similar in appearance but is slightly bulkier with longer wings and tail and a slightly smaller head and bill. It is slightly paler grey and the barring on the underparts is a little narrower. The vent is usually white with dark bars but is more similar to Oriental cuckoo in a few individuals. Birds of the rufous morph have a plain rump with no dark bars unlike the Oriental cuckoo. The Himalayan cuckoo (C. saturatus) is extremely similar to the Oriental cuckoo but is slightly smaller and shorter-winged. The call of the male Oriental cuckoo is a series of low paired notes, poo-poo, with both notes stressed equally. It is somewhat similar to the call of the hoopoe. It may be introduced with a four to eight note phrase or sometimes with grating notes. The female's call is a deep bubbling trill. Outside the breeding season, the birds are usually silent. The call of the male Himalayan cuckoo is a series of three or four note phrases with a short, high-pitched introductory note. Distribution It has a large breeding range in northern Eurasia. It breeds across much of Russia west to the Komi Republic with occasional records as far west as Saint Petersburg. It also breeds in northern Kazakhstan, Mongolia, northern China, Korea and Japan. The exact extent of its wintering range is uncertain due to its secretive habits and the difficulty of separating it from the Himalayan cuckoo and other similar species. It is believed to include the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, western Micronesia, the Solomon Islands and northern and eastern Australia with occasional birds reaching New Zealand. It has occurred as a vagrant in Ukraine, Israel and Alaska. Ecology It mainly inhabits forests, occurring in coniferous, deciduous and mixed forest. It feeds mainly on insects and their larvae, foraging for them in trees and bushes as well as on the ground. It is usually secretive and hard to see. It is a brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of other birds. The nests of Phylloscopus warblers such as the Arctic warbler, eastern crowned warbler, willow warbler and chiffchaff are commonly used. Other hosts include the olive-backed pipit and Asian stubtail. The eggs are smooth, slightly glossy and vary in colour, sometimes mimicking those of the host species. They are incubated for about 12 days. The young cuckoo is born naked and has an orange gape with black patches. Within a few days it pushes the eggs or young of the host out of the nest. Older nestlings have blackish feathers with white fringes; the belly is dark brown with white bands. The young birds fledge after around 17‚Äì19 days.

Troops of the Central Council: criminal negligence or threshold of possibility? \\"Military History\\" 2007 The rebels‚Äô main goal was an immediate proclamation of the Ukrainian independence. The rebellion itself had several political and social reasons. Soldiers of the Cossack regiment deeply lacked food supplies and medicines, experienced poor living conditions. Among the political reasons were those that the Central Council of Ukraine obtained pale national and military policy. In whole, more than 10 thousand soldiers and most of the population of Kiev found themselves in the center of the revolt. The uprising was later stifled due to the effective counter-actions of the Ukrainian officials and leaders of the Russian Kiev Military District. The participants of the revolt were mainly exiled to the Romanian World War I front-lines where they had soon found their death.

The commander of the First Ukrainian regiment Yuriy Kapkan who Mykola Mikhnovsky intended to play an important role in the coup disclosed Mikhnovsky's plans to Volodymyr Vynnychenko. =Russian government delegation= On 2 July 1917 a Russian government delegation headed by Alexander Kerensky visit Kiev after the declaration of the First Universal of Central Council that called for autonomous status of the Russian Southwestern Krai.

He first served the First Congregational Church in Middletown, Connecticut, as both associate pastor and senior pastor. This pastorate was followed by stints in Brookline, Massachusetts and Chicago; the Chicago congregation he served was a federation between the Congregational Christian Churches and the northern Presbyterians. CCC leadership All the while, Horton engaged his interest in inter-church relations by participating in bodies that eventually became the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches. He demonstrated a peculiar desire to, in the \\"Faith and Order\\" components of world ecumenical discussion, advance the notion that God desired for those Protestant churches separated for generations due to minor conflicts over theology and, more speciously, ethnic and socioeconomic differences to overcome the alienations of the past and join forces to bring a stronger Christian witness to a world beset by wars, poverty, and increasing indifference or hostility toward spiritual matters. Horton was undergirded in his thinking to a considerable measure by the influence of neoorthodoxy espoused by the likes of Karl Barth, one of whose books Horton translated into English. Due to his acumen and the keen ecumenical leanings of the CC Churches, Horton became the denomination's minister and general secretary in 1938, which gave him the leadership of the main national decision-making entity within the group. In that position, Horton would make his greatest contribution: overseeing the process of his church entering into a full organizational merger with a denomination governed by presbyterian polity, the Evangelical and Reformed Church. Merger Talks which began between leaders of the two churches in the 1930s blossomed into full-fledged preparations throughout the 1940s that brought about an actual plan by the end of that decade. Horton and advocates of the merger, however, encountered a vociferous minority of CC pastors and laity who argued that the merger would threaten the autonomy of the local congregations by the introduction of presbyterian governance practices from the E&R; Church, and that, legally, the General Council, the national legislative body, had no authority to enter its congregations into such a union in the first place. A Brooklyn church successfully sued in 1949 to restrain the merger from proceeding; in arguments before the appellate court, Horton and another CC leader, Truman Douglass, articulated that the General Council understood itself to be legally separate from the constituent congregations and not immediately subject to its directives, although admitting that it, likewise, had no power to compel participation in a merger. The court viewed these perspectives favorably, and the restraint was overturned in 1953. This enabled the final stages of the merger process to proceed, to the point of the actual union on June 25, 1957; the merged body took the name United Church of Christ. Before the merger was consummated, however, Horton had resigned his position as CC executive to assume the position of dean of the Harvard Divinity School, in 1955. The Rev. Fred Hoskins succeeded Horton as the final CC minister and general secretary; he became one of the first co-ministers of the new UCC. At Harvard, Horton expanded upon his inter-church interests, bringing new programs to the school such as religious studies and a chair in Roman Catholic theology. A one-time moderator of the International Congregational Council, Horton took on the leadership mantle of the WCC's Faith and Order Commission beginning in 1957. It was from that vantage point that Horton was invited to observe the Second Vatican Council; he compiled material for a four-volume journal of the proceedings. Retirement and death Horton retired from Harvard in 1960 and died eight years later in retirement. Horton was married to Mildred H. McAfee.

Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. At the beginning of the war, it formed the IX Reserve Corps with the 18th Reserve Division. Recruitment The division was composed primarily of troops from the Free and Hanseatic Cities and from Schleswig- Holstein. The division included one regular infantry brigade, the 81st, raised in Schleswig-Holstein and L√ºbeck, and one reserve infantry brigade, the 33rd, raised primarily in Hamburg and Bremen. Besides these regions, other troops of the division came from parts of the Province of Hanover adjoining Bremen and Hamburg. Combat chronicle The 17th Reserve Division fought on the Western Front. It fought across Belgium in August 1914 and then occupied the line on the Aisne until September 1915. It then went to Flanders and the Artois, where it remained engaged in positional warfare until June 1916. From mid-July to late October 1916, it fought in the Battle of the Somme with only one interlude away from the front. The division then remained in the trenchlines along the Yser until May 1917. In May, it fought in the Battle of Arras. It remained in the Flanders region for the rest of the year and into 1918 and fought in the Battle of Passchendaele. In 1918, it occupied various parts of the line and fought against several Allied offensives, including in the second Battle of Cambrai. In 1918, Allied intelligence rated the division as first class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914‚Äì1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 279‚Äì282.

The club runs two senior men's sides, a colts team, a women's senior team and a thriving junior section for both girls and boys. The men's 1st XV currently play in Western Counties West - a league at level 7 of the English rugby union system - following their relegation from South West 1 West at the end of the 2018-19 season. 260px 260px History/Background Teignmouth RFC was officially formed in January 1874 and have played at Bitton Park Sports Ground since 1904, with the exception of the 1906‚Äì07 and 1982‚Äì83 seasons. When league rugby was launched in England for the 1987‚Äì88 season, Teignmouth were placed in the Cornwall & Devon league, where they remained for thirteen years. The 2000‚Äì01 season was a bad year for Teignmouth Rugby Football Club. December 2000 saw the club closed down and put into administration due to an unpaid VAT bill. With the club facing closure a rescue package was launched with members raising enough money to buy the club out of administration. In a season badly affected by the foot and mouth crisis, which saw a number of games unplayed, Teignmouth finished mid-table but, due to the effects of relegation in higher divisions, Teignmouth were relegated to Devon League 1. Teignmouth were only to spend one season in the lower division, finishing second and meeting the runner-up of Cornwall League 1, Mount's Bay, at their Penzance ground. Teignmouth won a hotly contested match, 17‚Äì14 to achieve promotion. Teignmouth once again found themselves relegated to Devon 1 in 2005‚Äì06. Teignmouth dominated the division and bounced straight back up as 2006‚Äì07 league champions. The 2012‚Äì13 season was a successful one for Teignmouth; they comfortably won the Tribute Cornwall/Devon league and gained promotion to the Tribute Western Counties West league (the 7th tier of English rugby union league system). At the time, this was the highest level the club had ever competed at. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw Teignmouth finish second and reach a promotion play-off in their first season. Consecutive promotions proved to be a step too far, however, as they lost the play-off to Drybrook. The following year Teignmouth secured promotion to Tribute South West 1 West as 2014‚Äì15 league champions. To cap a memorable season, they also won the Devon Intermediate Cup, with victory against Kingsbridge. The 2015‚Äì16 season saw Teignmouth reach their highest league position of 10th in South West 1 West. They did even better with an 8th placed finish at the end of the 2017-18 season. Unfortunately, this did not last as the club suffered a relegation back to Western Counties West, finishing 12th out of 14th. Ground Bitton Park Sports Ground is situated in the town of Teignmouth on the banks of the River Teign, next to the Teignmouth Bridge and within walking distance of the train station. The ground has been occupied by the rugby club since 1904 and consists of a main pitch with a covered stand with seating, a club house, and a secondary pitch for seconds and youth fixtures. The main pitch has space for around 1,000 standing, which along with 210 in the stand brings the overall capacity to approximately 1,210.

It was associated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church. After the college closed, many of its facilities became the Kittrell Job Corps Center campus. About 400 students learned trades or were transfer to a college to continue their educations. Trades taught include furniture making, culinary arts, and electronics. The school was reopened in 2020 by Stephanie Freeman, a long-time educator and entrepreneur who was determined to save the legacy of this HBCU. The History of Kittrell College Kittrell College was established in 1886 in a small but growing town called Kittrell, located in Vance County, North Carolina. Initially, it was a normal and industrial training school that focused on training teachers and artisans who could help to build and advance the communities in which they lived. \\"Kittrell College\\" became the school's official name in 1901, with its first two names being more closely associated with the school's original mission. After financial hardships and other difficulties, Kittrell College closed its doors and was disbanded in 1975. The campus was later sold and then occupied by a federal job corp unit. Kittrell College Lives Again In 2014, a long-time educator and entrepreneur, Dr. Stephanie Freeman, was doing research on the history of various HBCUs when she came across an article about Kittrell College. Once she read the article, she became fascinated with Kittrell College and its mission. She, being a life- long North Carolinian, was shocked that she did not know anything about this vitally-needed institution. Later, she learned that Kittrell College was a two-year institution that specialized in vocational training and education and that its structure was a rarity among HBCUs. Since Freeman had always wanted her own school, she decided to do something that she had never considered before--re-open a defunct HBCU. In 2020, Freeman did what some said was not possible. She reestablished Kittrell College and wrote a letter to the HBCU Initiative in Washington, D.C. asking to have it formally recognized as an HBCU again. Freeman wanted to honor the original mission of the college by keeping it a two-year institution with vocational training and education still at the forefront. She plans to open the restructured Kittrell College in early 2021 with many of the original attributes but with a modern and innovative flare.

Until 1995 he was a professor of Pharmacology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Blum originated the term \\"reward deficiency syndrome\\". There is no consensus among addiction researchers that empirical evidence exists to justify such a concept. He holds multiple patents relating to genetic testing and treatment for the supposed syndrome that have been licensed through various different corporations.  Academic background  Blum received his B.S. in pharmacy from Columbia University in 1961, his M.S. in medical science in 1965 from the New Jersey College of Medicine, and his Ph.D. in pharmacology in 1968 from the New York Medical College. Blum completed post-doctorate research in psychopharmacology at the Southwest Foundation for Research and Education. He also completed a fellowship in pharmacogenetics under Gerald McClearn at the University of Colorado College of Pharmacy (Boulder) in 1977. He retired in 1995 from his position as professor at the Department of Pharmacology, Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, University of Texas.  Research  Blum collaborated on a study that found a correlation between an allele in the dopamine D2 Receptor and alcoholism in a post-mortem study of brain tissue from 35 alcoholics and 35 non-alcoholics. Blum believed his work to be of broader scope, calling this gene a \\"reward gene\\" which covers other addictive behaviors including drug addiction, smoking, overeating, and pathological gambling. = Reward deficiency syndrome = Blum originated the concept of reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) in 1996. The term has been applied to a wide variety of addictive, obsessive and compulsive behaviors including substance and process addictions, personality and spectrum disorders. There is no consistent evidence to validate any such syndrome. \\"Reward deficiency syndrome\\" is not a medically recognized disorder: The diagnostic validity of RDS has not been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in its diagnostic manual, the DSM.  Commercial activities  Blum is the editor-in- chief of Journal of Reward Deficiency Syndrome and Addiction Science and founded the company that publishes it, United Scientific Group. Blum was also editor-in-chief of OMICS Publication Group's Journal of Addiction Research & Therapy (JART) from 2013 to 2015. Both United Scientific Group and OMICS Group are featured on Beall's list and are widely regarded as predatory open-access publishers. Blum has received patents for the use of dietary supplements to treat RDS. Blum licenses these patents through his company Synaptamine, Inc., which is incorporated in Austin, Texas. Supplements marketed in this way include Synaptamine, SyntaptaGenX, and Synaptose. Synaptamine has been licensed to LaVita RDS, a company based in Lehi, Utah, of which Blum was the Chief Scientific Officer. Synaptamine was subsequently marketed by Sanus Biotech, a company based in Austin, Texas. SynaptaGenX is licensed to NuPathways Inc., for whom Blum acts as Chief Neuroscience Advisor. Blum has also marketed dietary supplements that claim to assist weight loss, including PhenCal (licensed to Weider Nutrition) and SyntaptaLean (licensed to Nature's Plus). In the past, Blum has sold a variety of supplements and oral sprays through a website called DocBlumInc. Blum markets a genetic test, the Genetic Addiction Risk Score (GARS), through his company IGENE LLC in partnership with Dominion Diagnostics, through LifeGen, Inc., where he is Chairman of the Board and Chief Scientific Officer, and via Geneus Health for whom he also acts Chief Scientific Officer and Chairman. It is claimed that GARS assesses the genetic predisposition toward RDS. Until 2008 he was Chief Scientific Officer of Salugen Inc., another direct-to-consumer genetics testing company. After Blum's departure, Salugen continued under the leadership of Brian Meshkin, latterly CEO of Proove Biosciences, until its demise a year later. Blum is Scientific Director of the PATH foundation. Geneus Health LLC and Dominion Diagnostics market genetic tests that purport to assess genetic predisposition toward addictive behavior. Since 2007 Dominion Diagnostics has paid more than $2 million in settlement of lawsuits that alleged fraudulent overbilling of Medicare and Medicaid.

It is a neotropical genus consisting of 18-27 species, mostly hardwood evergreen trees, occurring from Costa Rica to the southeast of Brazil (Werff 1987). 13 species have been identified in Brazil, distributed mostly in the Amazon region. In Rio de Janeiro state only M. navalium (Allem√£o) Taub. ex Mez has been recorded. Some species have been reported within the Cerrado and in semideciduous forest surrounding the Pantanal Matogrossense. The name Mezilaurus (half laurel) refers to its similar appearance to the genus Laurus. The genus was described by Otto Kuntze ex Paul Hermann Wilhelm Taubert and published in Centralblatt Botanischer 50: 21 in 1892. The type species is Mezilaurus navalium (Allem√£o) Taub. Ex Mez. This genus is closely related to Licaria and Aiouea. Mezilaurus are monoecious trees or shrubs with leaves alternate, usually congested at the apex of the branches, without papillae on the abaxial epidermis. The inflorescences are panicles with racemose terminations. The flowers are bisexual, with a hypanthium that is narrows at the top, uncompressed below the tepals, 6 tepals are usually erect and equal, the inner surface without papillae. There are three fertile stamens. Stamens of the third whorl are fertile. The fruit is black, sometimes cupulated. The cupula when present with pateliforme summit, small in relation to the fruit, the tepals are deciduous.http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid;=S0102-33062005000300017 The fruit is a berry-like drupe.

It moved there in 1913 from its original location at King's College in London's Strand. Distinguished in its heyday for its contribution of young men to the civil service, it finally closed its doors in 1979 after hotly contested attempts by the education authorities from the early 1950s onwards to turn it into a comprehensive school. Former pupils included a leader of the Greater London Council, figures prominent in the world of entertainment, and the scientist and environmentalist James Lovelock, originator of the Gaia hypothesis. History =Origins= Strand School got its name from the fact that it originated in the evening department of King's College in London's Strand. The teaching of evening classes commenced there in 1848; under Alfred Barry, principal between 1868 and 1883, these were \\"considerably extended\\":Strand School/ King's College London Archives ::In 1875, the government extended the range of the entry examination to the Civil Service and William Braginton set up private classes for those seeking entry into the lower grades. That year he suggested that a connection be established with King's College, allowing him to use rooms in the College and to benefit from its prestige. When in 1875 the government extended the range of the civil service entry examination, William Braginton had set up private classes in rooms at King's College in the Strand for those seeking entry into the lower grades. The prestige of being associated with the university college was an added benefit. The Civil Service Department, as it was known in the early years, started with an intake of 172 men: it did not yet constitute a school for boys. In 1892 Braginton got permission to run a correspondence course, and day classes, for pupils wishing to compete for \\"boy clerkships\\" and \\"boy copyistships\\". Thus, in 1893, began Strand School. The school's name was not apparent, however, till 1897, when King's College School moved to Wimbledon, making it possible for the commercial school to move into the college basement. Examinations on offer had by this time increased beyond those of the civil service as such, to include telegraph learners, assistant surveyorships, as well as those for customs and excise appointments. The success rate of Strand pupils was noteworthy. Many Old Strandians, as they became known, went on to distinguished careers in the civil service. In 1900 the London County Council (LCC) agreed that intermediate county scholarships could be held there, and in 1905 it was allowed to become a centre for the training of pupil teachers.Keith Dakin-White, 'History of Strand School, 1875-1913', written for MA in Science Education, Chelsea College, University of London, 1984 =Relocation to South London= In 1907 the Board of Education determined that a mere basement was insufficient for a school. The threat of withdrawal of grant support caused the LCC to undertake to provide new buildings in Elm Park, between Tulse Hill and Brixton Hill in South London. In 1909 government of the school was handed over to a committee, which included LCC representatives. As a condition of the incorporation of King's College into the University of London, under the terms of the King's College London Transfer Act 1908, the civil service classes for adults had to be placed under separate administration, so Braginton agreed to make the necessary arrangements: he relinquished the headmastership In 1909, to run St George's College for women, Red Lion Square, and St George's College for men in Kingsway. R.B. Henderson took over as headmaster of Strand School in 1910, and he it was who supervised the move to South London in 1913. After the move to its new red brick premises, Strand flourished as a grammar school. Though its priority had been to prepare candidates for the civil service, it went on to offer courses leading to the Ordinary and Advanced level GCE examinations. Extra-curricular activities included a variety of sports such as football, cricket, swimming, athletics, boxing and fives. Games and social activities were organised on a House system, with boys being allocated a house on entering the school and thereafter being guided by a housemaster. There was active competition between the school's six houses: Arundel, Bedford, Exeter, Kings, Lancaster, and Salisbury. These are the names of streets off the Strand, plus Kings College. Salisbury Street no longer exists.\\"The Strand, southern tributaries - continued\\", British History online The school had an annual sports day, which was held on the school field until 1952, when Tulse Hill Comprehensive was built there.The Strand School Magazine, Vol. XII, no. 8, December 1953, p. 19. There were a number of societies, including a debating society, a dramatic society and, in later years, a film society. The cadet force, had air force and army sections, the latter affiliated to the Kings Royal Rifle Corps.London County Council, (1962), Secondary Schools in Bermondsey, Lambeth and Southwark, Division 8, page 22 The school published each July and December The Strand School Magazine. A printing press in the gallery above the main hall turned out three school calendars a year, one for each term, visiting cards, membership cards for school societies and letter- headings, as well as programmes for school plays.The Strand, Vol. X11, no. 13, July 1956, p. 29. 1936: Tragedy in the Black Forest \\"Engl√§nderdenkmal\\" (\\"Monument to Englishmen\\"), at Schauinsland, Black Forest, Germany The school suffered a major tragedy on 17 April 1936 when a hiking party of 27 were caught in a blizzard in the Black Forest, near Freiburg, Germany, and five boys died. They had set out on a three-hour hike between hostels, via Schauinsland, 4200 feet, expecting normal spring weather.The Times, 20 April 1936, p. 15. The master in charge, Kenneth Keast, stated that the blizzard \\"was described by all Germans as catastrophic and beyond all calculation\\".The Times, 20 May 1936, p. 13. Keast was absolved from blame and commended for his courage by the London County Council's committee of enquiry.The Times', 20 May 1936, p. 13. However, a 2016 article in The Guardian tells a different story of an ill-equipped party, and suggests that Keast ignored the advice of local people.\\"Fatal hike became nazi propaganda coup\\" by Kate Connolly, The Guardian online In 1938 the ' (\\"Monument to Englishmen\\") of architect Hermann Alker was erected by the Hitler Youth in commemoration.Egon Schw√§r: Sagen in Oberried und seinen Ortsteilen Hofsgrund, St. Wilhelm, Zastler und Weilersbach. 3.

Crossword security alarm The school in 1944, via its then-headmaster Leonard Dawe, was involved in what became known as the D-Day Daily Telegraph crossword security alarm. =1956: Tulse Hill Comprehensive School and the final years= Strand served its surrounding area for most of the twentieth century as the local boys' grammar school, with nearby St Martin-in-the Fields High School providing for girls. In the mid-1950s came the first serious threat to Strand School's existence, when two large comprehensive schools were opened locally: Dick Sheppard School for girls in 1955,London County Council, (1962), Secondary Schools in Bermondsey, Lambeth and Southwark, Division 8 and the giant Tulse Hill School for boys in 1956, the latter built on what had been the Strand playing fields.London County Council, Secondary Schools: Division 8, April 1962, page 24. Only by a narrow marginfollowing an intense campaign by parents, old boys and school governorshad the school beaten off a plan to abolish it as a grammar school, and turn it into one of the two comprehensives: what became Tulse Hill Comprehensive was to have been known as \\"Strand Comprehensive.\\" The successful campaign provided what was to prove, in the end, only temporary respite. With the abolition of the tripartite system in education, the Inner London Education Authority took the decision to go fully comprehensive. So in 1972 the ILEA again proposed that Strand, described by Labour's Roy Hattersley as a \\"small maintained boys' grammar school in an elderly building,\\" be turned into a comprehensive; its pupils were to be transferred to Dick Sheppard, with the Strand and Tulse Hill buildings merged to form a single new comprehensive school. Battle once again commenced. Margaret Thatcher, at the time Secretary of State for Education, later approved the closure, but not the Tulse Hill School alterations. Strand parents this time chose to contest the closure in the courts: in May 1972 an injunction was granted forbidding closure. The Labour-controlled ILEA was forced to abandon immediate closure of Strand, but made a second application to the minister in July 1972. Thatcher turned down this application in January 1973, saying that the change of heart was because she had \\"listened to the parents and watched their fight to save a small school which provided an opportunity for anyone who got there on a basis of merit, whatever his background.\\"House of Commons Speech by Margaret Thatcher (Secondary Education (Opposition motion)), (1973 Feb 1), (Hansard HC [849/1639-68]) Around 1979 Strand School was closed down. King's College, London archives, show pupils' details 1946-1979 Its remnants were merged with Dick Sheppard School, which became, for the time that remained, a mixed school. Of all four schools, the only one to survive the rigours of improvement and shifting education policy was St Martin-In-The-Fields High School for Girls. Tulse Hill School closed in 1990, and Dick Sheppard School in 1994. =Subsequent history of the building= After Strand School's closure, the buildings became known as the Strand Centre and had various uses. They were used as temporary premises for schools being renovated and by an Albanian Youth Group.Lambeth Planning Applications Committee, Case No. 06/02778/RG3, Page 100, (Lambeth Planning) In 2000 they were converted for use as a primary school to temporarily house Brockwell Primary School, while the new Jubilee Primary School was being built on Brockwell's site. When Jubilee Primary finally opened in 2003 the Strand premises again fell vacant. 2009, Elm Court School In 2007, to house Elm Court School, major renovation were made at the former Strand School site.Lambeth Planning Applications Committee, Case 06/02778/RG3 The Strand Centre, (2006), (Lambeth Planning) Elm Court is a \\"special educational needs\\" school with capacity for 100 pupils at key stages 3 and 4,‚Ä∫ Services \\"aged 9 to 19 years who have learning difficulties with associated social and communication needs. Many ... pupils have autism\\".Elm Court School The school moved from Elmcourt Road in West Norwood to make way for the new Elmgreen secondary school. Elm Court School opened in Elm Park SW2 in March 2009. The school's architecture Wisdom teaches youth: the alto-relievo above the school's main entrance in Elm Park The buildings near the southern end of Elm Park were built by the London County Council between 1912 and 1914 under the direction of the chief architect W.E. Riley.Edmund Bird, (January 1997), Consultation Draft Report & Character Assessment Statement For The Proposed Brixton Hill Conservation Area, (London Borough Of Lambeth Environmental Services) The style employed was Edwardian, with a red brick frontage decorated with Portland stone dressings, enlivened by a central stone arched window incorporating a sculpture. Other features of the school were its main hall with its war memorial to pupils and former pupils who died in the First and Second World Wars, in the form of a large organ bought by public subscription, the gymnasium at the rear of the main building, and, on the top floor, what were laboratories and the dining hall. In the 1960s a two-storey art and woodkwork/metalwork block was built next to the gymnasium. The school has been described as, \\"one of the finest secular buildings in terms of its architectural quality and character\\" and, \\"a splendid local landmark of significant historic and architectural interest in its own right.\\" A less obvious feature is the two Fives courts located behind the school. These are similar to those required for Rugby Fives. A photograph showing the right hand court in use (from 1914) exists in the Frith Collection.

He moved on to the University of New Hampshire, where he was a three- year starter at linebacker. He also played some fullback. He led the team in tackles in his last two seasons, while helping the team win two Yankee Conference Championships (1975 and 1976). Professional career =Dallas Cowboys (first stint)= Huther was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1977 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he played mainly on special teams and was a part of the Super Bowl XII winning team, recovering a fumble during the game. In his second season, he was named the special teams captain and solidified his status as one of the best players on the unit. He won the team's special teams player of the year award twice. He was also considered one of the strongest players on the team. On August 24, 1981, to make room for rookie Danny Spradlin, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns in exchange of a sixth round draft choice (#143-Ken Hammond). =Cleveland Browns= In 1981, he appeared in 16 games (2 starts), but after the team signed Tom Cousineau in the offseason, he demanded to be traded and was sent to the Chicago Bears in exchange of a seventh round draft choice (#176-Rocky Belk) on August 13, 1982. =Chicago Bears= In 1982, he was a backup linebacker with the Chicago Bears.

He was not re- signed after the season. =Dallas Cowboys (second stint)= On October 1, 1983, Huther signed as a free agent with the Dallas Cowboys to replace Scott McLean, who was out for the season. He started five games at middle linebacker in place of an injured Bob Breunig. =Pittsburgh Maulers (USFL)= In 1984, although his rights belonged to the Chicago Blitz of the United States Football League, the Pittsburgh Maulers traded for him and also convinced him not to re-sign with the Dallas Cowboys. After leading the team in tackles, he was benched the next year in favor of rookie Ernest Adams, which made Huther to eventually force his release. =Denver Gold (USFL)= On May 30, 1984, he signed as a free agent with the Denver Gold, where he played until the league folded.

It opened in September 2007 and houses a 600-seat proscenium theater, a 200-seat studio theater and a 3,500-square-foot gallery. Its Lakeside Room seats 200 and overlooks Tempe Town Lake, with views of the Papago and Camelback mountains. Architecture The building was designed by Barton Myers Associates of Los Angeles and Architekton of Tempe. A citizens group, formed in 1998, spearheaded a ballot initiative to create an arts center. The resulting increase in the sales tax of .1% was used to fund seed money for the management, design, and construction of the facility. At the entrance, environmental designer Ned Kahn uses 8,000 embedded marbles and tiny mirrors to create a shimmery sunlit effect at the Center‚Äôs marquee. He echoes this shimmering effect on the west wall of the Lakeside room where a massive array of mirrors captures and digitizes the available light reflecting off the Center‚Äôs expansive negative edge pool.[1] Unlike most theaters, this lobby is open to the public without a ticket and becomes a popular gathering place that brings art and community together while enhancing the Tempe landscape, promoting positive quality of life issues related to sustainability, recreation and culture.[1] A management firm (Kitchell CEM) was selected by the city government to oversee a three-phase design competition, leading to the selection of the design team in 2000. Following public input, the design was completed in 2003. Construction began in April 2004 and took 40 months. The Center was completed in August, 2007, with a grand opening on September 9, 2007. The Center features a roof made of complex geometric folded plates. The roof is highly visible from the surrounding freeways and the man-made Tempe Town Lake, which occupies the natural watercourse of the Salt River, immediately adjacent to the site. It is also visible by many airplanes landing at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, two miles west of the building. Five public art pieces were included in the design: * Entry Marquee ‚Äì Ned Kahn * Fireplace‚Äì trueNorth - Mayme Kratz and Mark Ryan * Fountain Reflections ‚Äì Ned Kahn * Lobby Carpet ‚Äì Ramona Saskiestewa * Aurora  Brower Hatcher The Center includes the Gallery at TCA, a visual arts gallery featuring free exhibits of two- and three-dimensional artwork by local and internationally recognized artists. Producing Artistic Director: Ralph Remington To advance the goals outlined in its recently completed Arts and Culture Plan, the City of Tempe has hired theater veteran Ralph Remington to serve a new role within the Community Services Department as Arts and Culture Deputy Director and Artistic Director of Tempe Center for the Arts sponsored by Northern Trust. Remington is the former Western Regional Director/Assistant Executive Director of Actors' Equity Association and the former Director of Theater and Musical Theater for the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also written seven feature screenplays and two plays. His essay ‚ÄúTo Be Black in America,‚Äù has been published in the African American literary anthology, ‚ÄúBlues Vision‚Äù while another essay, ‚ÄúMichael, Obama, and Post-Racial Deconstruction,‚Äù was published in the anthology ‚ÄúGoodbye, Billie Jean: The Meaning of Michael Jackson.‚Äù His play \\"Penetrating Whiteness\\" was a semi- finalist in 2015 at the Eugene O‚ÄôNeill National Playwright‚Äôs Competition.

Written, produced and directed by Preston A. Whitmore II, it is a Christmas time story that centers on the Whitfield family, whose eldest has come home for the first time in four years. The film is based on the 1970 Donny Hathaway song of the same name, which is covered by Chris Brown in the film. The Whitfield family overcome many trials and obstacles during the Christmas season. Plot Shirley Ann \\"Ma'Dere\\" Whitfield greets her boyfriend Joe when he wakes up. Lisa, her husband Malcolm and their two kids are about to leave, and Michael \\"Baby\\" Whitfield gets a digital camera from Joe when Ma'Dere confronts him about this. Quentin plays a saxophone at a local bar; after being followed he retreats to the bar. Lisa, Kelli, and Claude come to Ma'Dere's house for the Christmas holiday. Melanie \\"Mel\\" shows up with her boyfriend Devan. During dinner, Malcolm asks how he feels about \\"attending an all-black college\\". Melanie and Devan say that they both have the same major. Lisa suggests they should give up the dry-cleaners business, which leads to an argument between Lisa and Kelli. After Quentin arrives, he talks to his family at the dinner table; when he sees Joe he starts to make rude remarks towards him. In the kitchen, Mel informs Devan about Ma'Dere's ex-husband Senior; they kiss and eventually make out. Quentin finds Joe and threatens him again. When Joe leaves, he plays the piano in the garage. Claude attempts to sneak off to a club, causing everyone to come with him. When Baby sings Try a Little Tenderness at a club, the family is astonished when they find out he can sing. Kelli and Gerald meet and have an instant attraction. Eventually, Claude loses his temper with a couple of guys who attempted to hit on Sandi and pulls his gun out at the club, causing them to leave. At the house, Baby convinces his siblings to keep it a secret, until he informs Ma'Dere about his talent for singing. The next day, all the guys look for a Christmas tree. Later on, Kelli, Lisa, and Mel are wrapping presents, when Kelli confesses that she slept with Gerald. At the airport, Malcolm has to leave because of his \\"job\\" and Lisa asks him why he has to leave so soon. In response, he tells Lisa everything will work out and Lisa feels depressed when Malcolm says they're \\"partners\\". Lisa comes home with Mo and Dude, who attempts to beat Quentin, until he tells them that a police car is nearby. Claude is arrested and Lisa and Quentin goes to the station to fix the situation. Lisa explains to Quentin why they have to sell the dry cleaners. Ma'Dere scolds the family, for not cooking dinner or getting prepared for Christmas. When Lisa and Quentin return, they tell everyone that Claude is AWOL and the family is shocked when they meet Claude's newly wed, Sandi. Mo and Dude meet Ma'Dere, resulting in Quentin acting nonchalant. Sandi tells Mel why Claude is AWOL and eventually admits that she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Quentin confronts Ma'Dere about her relationship with Joe and why no one told him that she and Senior were divorced. Outside, Kelli talks to Lisa about the events that took place, and Lisa also tells her that even though she didn't get a college degree, someone had to help their mom with the dry-cleaning business when she went to Harvard. Kelli admits that Malcolm is cheating on her and Lisa confesses that she already knew about it. Kelli says that 'sharing her man with another woman is pathetic', leading to a fight between Lisa and Kelli in the rain. When Mel breaks up the fight, Mel tells Kelli about Sandi's pregnancy and that Claude doesn't know about it. In the meantime, Lisa angrily damages Malcolm's car when she manages to let it fall off a cliff. That night, Gerald spends the night with Kelli. Baby gives Quentin a scrapbook of Christmas pictures before he leaves. Baby confesses to Ma'Dere that he has a singing talent but she refuses to listen. Quentin goes to the train station but he is ambushed by Mo and Dude; Joe shows up to defend him. Kelli asks Gerald to come visit her in New York. Lisa persuades Malcolm to take a shower, then she confronts Malcolm about cheating on her and beats him repeatedly with a belt, and they reluctantly divorce. At church, Baby sings \\"This Christmas\\" and Claude shows up at the church after being released. After the church service, Quentin returns and reconciles with Joe and his family. The cast members are seen dancing to the song Got to Give It Up (via a Soul Train line) before the end- credits roll.

He also holds Italian citizenship, and spent most of his career with Espanyol, being hindered by several injuries. Football career =Gr√™mio= Born in Iju√≠, Rio Grande do Sul, Mattioni joined Gr√™mio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense in 2004, being promoted to the main squad three years later but failing to appear in the S√©rie A in his first season. However, after performing well in the Campeonato Brasileiro Sub-20 and appearing in the Campeonato Ga√∫cho, he made his debut in the top division in a 2‚Äì0 home win against Clube N√°utico Capibaribe. On 15 January 2009, A.C. Milan in Italy acquired Mattioni on loan, with the Rossoneri having an option to buy the player at the end of the campaign. He played his first match in a 2‚Äì2 friendly draw to Rangers, but failed to make an impact due to leg injuries, his Serie A input consisting of two minutes in a 2‚Äì0 away victory over Calcio Catania on 3 May. In June 2009, Milan announced the club would not exercise the buying option on Mattioni. On 26 August, RCD Mallorca signed him also on loan, from Associa√ß√£o Maga Esporte Clube company, with a pre-set price of about ‚Ç¨2 million. During the season he battled for first-choice status with Josemi, scoring from 40 meters in a 4‚Äì1 home win against Atl√©tico Madrid as the Balearic Islands team eventually finished fifth and qualified to the UEFA Europa League (later revoked). =Espanyol= In May 2010, Mallorca decided to sign Mattioni permanently for ‚Ç¨2 million subject to the decision of the administrator of the club, which was undergoing severe financial difficulties. Finally the deal fell through, and he joined fellow La Liga side RCD Espanyol from Maga. Early into his spell in Catalonia, Mattioni sustained a severe knee injury ‚Äì left anterior cruciate ligament ‚Äì going on to miss the entire 2010‚Äì11 campaign. Shortly after recovering he suffered the same injury in his right leg, being initially ruled out for another six months and eventually nearly two years. Mattioni finally returned to action on 1 November 2012, appearing as a late substitute in a 1‚Äì3 away loss against Sevilla FC for the round of 32 in the Copa del Rey. His first league appearance came on 2 February of the following year, as he started and played the full 90 minutes in a 3‚Äì2 home defeat of Levante UD. =Everton= On 29 September 2015, Mattioni featured for Premier League club Everton's under-21 side, playing in a 3‚Äì1 win over Norwich City. A month later, he signed a contract until the end of the season but was immediately loaned out to Doncaster Rovers of League One. He made his debut for the latter on 7 November in the first round of the FA Cup, featuring the full 90 minutes of a 2‚Äì0 win over amateurs Stalybridge Celtic at the Keepmoat Stadium. =Back to Brazil= On 7 February 2017, Boa Esporte Clube announced the signing of Mattioni until the end of the season. He was injured in his third S√©rie B match, and did not regain his place in the team. Mattioni joined Veran√≥polis Esporte Clube Recreativo e Cultural in October 2017, ahead of the upcoming edition of the Campeonato Ga√∫cho. The following April he agreed to a deal at Esporte Clube Juventude of the second division, scoring in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Gr√™mio Esportivo Brasil as the campaign ended in relegation. In December 2018, free agent Mattioni moved to Coritiba Foot Ball Club.

It plays in the second division Serie A2 as of the 2015-16 season. History In 1965, Gianni Rossetti (a television journalist for RAI), Carlo Barchiesi (current president) and Primo Novelli (then responsible for the club's junior sides) helped form Aurora Basket Jesi along with president Mario Gherardi. At the time, Springoil had been strongest side of Jesi, flirting with a promotion to the top-tier, but it disappeared due to financial difficulties. Roberto Vigo suggested to Gianni Rossetti that a basketball team should be set up within the Aurora Group. The team started play during the 1965-66 season in the highest regional division. Slowly moving up the divisions, the club moved up to the national Serie D in 1973. Jesi moved up to the Serie C2 after the 1979-80 season, thanks to players such as Giovannini, Carnevali and Castelli from Fabriano and Paccapelo from Lineaerre Team Pesaro. The team reached the Serie C2 playoffs in its first season, the next season it lost in the finals against Basket Barcellona. Jesi would achieve promotion to the Serie C1 after the 1983-84 season, finishing the regular season in second place before winning the promotion playoffs They were relegated from the C1 at the end of their first season, but returned the following year. Later returning to the Serie D, Jesi rejoined the Serie C in 1989-90. The club reached the second division Serie A2 after the 1996-97 season in which it beat Gaverina Bergamo in the playoff finals in May 1997. The 1999-00 season saw the side reach the Final Eight of the Italian Cup, the 2003-04 season saw a historic promotion to the Serie A. However, the club struggled in the Serie A, firing coach Luigi Gresta as they were relegated. in 2005, they would recruit coach Luca Banchi and small-forward Romain Sato, reaching the playoffs at the end of the season. The Latini family, major backers, withdrew their sponsorship of a club they had helped for sixteen years at the end of the season. In 2006, the club scrambled to find new financing, ultimately securing backing, with Fileni becoming their main sponsor. A team containing Brion Rush reached the playoffs, losing in the semifinals.

Jean Ybarnegaray was born in Uhart- Cize, Department of Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques, then called Basses Pyr√©n√©es, in the Northern Basque Country. He studied law at the Sorbonne and Bordeaux University and practised as a lawyer. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in April 1914. On the outbreak of the First World War, he was recalled to service. He was wounded and discharged from the army with the L√©gion d'honneur, returning to the Chamber of Deputies, where he criticised the Nivelle Offensive of 1917, the armistice of 1918 and the Treaty of Versailles. A member of the Republican Federation, Ybarnegaray joined the French Social Party of Fran√ßois de La Rocque in 1938. He served as Minister of State in Paul Reynaud's government from 10 May 1940. On arrival of refugees from the Basque (1937) and Catalan fronts (1939) in the Spanish Civil War, Ybarnegaray took a hostile stance against the exiles, labeling them as \\"reds\\" and turned a cold shoulder to Basque nationalism or any Basque political approach. He served in the Vichy government, as Minister of State in the first government of Marshal Philippe P√©tain and as Minister for Veterans and the Family in the second P√©tain government. He resigned his office on 6 September 1940. Ybarnegaray had undertaken French Resistance activities, assisting escapees in crossing the Pyrenees, for which he was arrested in 1943, and detained in Plansee in the state of Tyrol. Although he was sentenced after the war to losing civil rights, his Resistance activities resulted in the sentence being suspended. He died in Paris on 25 April 1956.

On 11 August, she departed Norfolk for the Pacific Ocean, but with the end of hostilities, her orders were changed, and after towing scows from Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, to Tampa, Florida, she sailed to Davisville, Rhode Island, for mooring buoys. These she laid at Jacksonville, Florida, in October.  End of war in Europe  Escape sailed from Key West, Florida, 8 November 1945 to escort and later tow the Italian submarine Mameli to Taranto. She returned to Norfolk 22 January 1946, and on 20 July 1946 was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Orange, Texas.  Recommissioning during Korean War  Recommissioned 12 July 1951, Escape was homeported at Norfolk for salvage and towing services to the Fleet along the east coast, and from 1954, spent alternate years in the Caribbean, based on San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 26 January 1960 Escape got underway for Operation Sky Hook. While on station she was diverted to Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, to assist (DD-938) which had gone aground.  Project Mercury  On 30 January 1960 Escape got underway to assist in Project Mercury, a United States space- flight program. She continued to give essential support to the fleet through the remainder of 1960. On 1 September 1978, she was decommissioned and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet.  Transfer to Coast Guard  Escape in Coast Guard colours. Escape was transferred to U.S. Coast Guard and commissioned USCGC Escape (WMEC-6), 1 September 1978. She served the Coast Guard until 29 June 1995 when she was returned to the Navy.  Final decommissioning  Escape was decommissioned and returned to Naval custody, 29 June 1995. She was struck from the Naval Register, 29 June 1995 and her title was transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD). She was then laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, Fort Eustis, Virginia. Final disposition: Sold for scrap to Bay Bridge Enterprises in August 2009.

Development and service  The RegioSwinger was first manufactured by Adtranz in Hennigsdorf, before it became part of Bombardier Transportation in 2001. The train is in use in Germany with Deutsche Bahn as class 612 and was introduced to Croatia with Croatian Railways as H≈Ω 7123 or InterCity Nagibni (ICN) in 2004.nov-ost.info - Erste \\"Regioswinger\\" f√ºr Kroatien The public shortened that name, so it caught the nickname nagibni (swinger) in Croatia, and became known also by that short name, due to commercials. Class 612's predecessor was class 611, which due to heavy problems with the tilting system and the chassis was largely considered a failure. Even though class 612 sticks to the principle of an electric tilting system (Neicontrol-E), it was newly engineered from the beginning. The first units were delivered in 1998 and worked reliably until 2004, when cracks were detected in a number of wheel sets. For safety reasons, the tilting system was disabled and subsequently the maximum speed on tilting lines was reduced, causing a massive disorder in the schedules. As before with class 611, wheels and axles had to be replaced. Starting in 2005, class 612 was equipped with hardened molybdenum axles. Today class 612 is back to tilting operation and forms the backbone of DB's fast regional service on un- electrified lines. After ICE TD class 605 was grounded due to a fracture of an axle in one unit, it was replaced by class 612 on the Dresden-Munich line 2003, as replacement by anything other than a tilting DMU would have meant an extension of travel time. Even though class 612 was not constructed for ICE- type travelling comfort, 16 units were repainted in the ICE paint scheme and renumbered as class 612.4. Ironically, only one year later the same problem forced DB to disable the tilting system on the replacement also.  Technical information  Class 612 units comprise two motorised coaches, each with a Cummins engine (type QSK-19). The power is transferred hydraulically. Up to four units can be connected by the Scharfenberg coupler, with the on-board computers automatically choosing the train configuration. Besides pneumatic brakes and a hydraulic braking system, class 612 is also equipped with an electro-magnetic brake. The maximum tilt is 8¬∞. Accidents On July 24, 2009, a train derailed near Rudine, Croatia, with 119 passengers aboard, killing 6 and injuring 55, on the Zagreb-Split line.Derailment location (estimated) According to Croatian news reports, the cause of the derailment was slippery fire retardant that was just sprayed on a steep downhill section of the track, a normal practice in extreme summer heat but executed improperly using a new chemical. With brakes ineffective, the train gained a speed higher than the track configuration could handle and derailed. Jeziva ≈æeljezniƒçka nesreƒáaKriv je premaz pruge - slijede prijaveVlak smrti: Glavni predmet istrage Ivan Medak i Drago Rogulja Croatian news media report that this section of the track was reconstructed in 2005 and that the particular train passed inspection just two days prior to the accident, but the accident brought back the debate on whether these trains are appropriate for local conditions. Investigation continues, with questionable application of fire retardant (recently changed to \\"aqueous based resin liquid penetrate\\" TG-300 from a new supplier) emerging as the most likely cause of the accident.TG-300 Outdoor Applications Gallery Image:Nagibni 1.jpgThe Croatian version of the RegioSwinger: InterCityNagibni.

They were developed to replace the problematic DB Class 611. The sets worked fine between 1998 and 2004 until cracks were detected in a number of wheelsets and so the tilting system was disabled and curves on lines had to have reduced speed limits, which affected the timetables and connections.

The song features a prominent example of Bj√∂rk's use of a half-singing, half-speaking technique which, according to folklore specialist Njall Sigurason, is comparable to that of Old Icelandic choirmen.Music and Technoculture, ed. R. Lysloff and L. Gay Structurally, the song is made up of a slowly sweeping melody, saxophones, a church organ, and distant-sounding electronic beats. Thematically, the song describes two faraway lovers. One of the lovers realizes that the love between the two of them is unraveling because of factors out of their control. The lover, Bj√∂rk, seeks to reunite with her lover to rebuild the love lost. Music video Even though \\"Unravel\\" was not released as a single, a music video was made by Lynn Fox to promote Bj√∂rk's Greatest Hits Tour. The video won a silver prize at the 2004 D&AD; Awards, an event recognizing annual achievements in design and advertising. The video itself depicts Bj√∂rk in a deep sea-like environment, wearing a billowing dress as a large and furry unidentified sea creature grows out of her back in a strings-like manner.

A cover of \\"Unravel\\" appears on folk rock artist Okkervil River's split CD Sham Wedding/Hoax Funeral, as well as the Japanese import version of alternative rock band Something Corporate's album North. The Flaming Lips and Midlake added the song to their albums Late Night Tales: The Flaming Lips and Late Night Tales: Midlake respectively, which is a compilation of artists and songs that have affected and influenced the bands. Anthony Green and Casey Crescenzo performed an acoustic cover of \\"Unravel\\" as a part of a 2007 tour featuring Circa Survive and The Dear Hunter. Portuguese guitarist Norberto Lobo recorded a cover of \\"Unravel\\" for his 2009 album Pata Lenta.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues. The class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DRA) and a beta chain (DRB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen-presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages).  Gene structure and polymorphisms  The beta chain is approximately 26-28 kDa. It is encoded by 6 exons, exon one encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and exon 5 encodes the cytoplasmic tail. Within the DR molecule the beta chain contains all the polymorphisms specifying the peptide binding specificities. Hundreds of DRB1 alleles have been described and typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow and kidney transplantation.  Gene expression  DRB1 is expressed at a level five times higher than its paralogues DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5. DRB1 is present in all individuals. Allelic variants of DRB1 are linked with either none or one of the genes DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5. The presence of DRB5 is linked with allelic variants of DRB1, otherwise it is omitted.

The AHA's role is to further and protect the interests of its members throughout Australia which are employers and can be owners, operators or lessees of hotels, bars and other hospitality businesses. The areas of focus include accommodation, food, beverages, entertainment, wagering and gaming; the maintenance of the law; promotion of business activity, education, training and advocating the economic and social benefits of the industry. The AHA was originally established in 1839. In early April 1839, several meetings of Licensed Victuallers (Hoteliers) were held in Hobart at the White Horse Tavern, Liverpool St. At one of these meetings it was suggested that a society be formed for the mutual benefit and protection of its members.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8750213 Today the AHA is a federation of state-based hotels associations. There are 8 state based Hotel and Hospitality Associations, one in each state or territory. These state associations fund and support the AHA national body through a National Board made up of delegates from the states and territories. Presidents of each branch meet regularly to discuss strategic and executive matters, as the National Executive. Members of the AHA receive advice, support and services from their local state or territory AHA branch, and the AHA's accommodation hotel members are serviced by Tourism Accommodation Australia (TAA) ‚Äì a division of members within the AHA representing the specific interests of the accommodation sector.http://aha.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/AHA- National-Policy-Platform-2013.pdf AHA Policy objectives The AHA describes its major policy and activities as communications, development of policy, advocacy, government and industry liaison and corporate partnerships. The AHA is represented on the National Tourism Alliance, Tourism Minister's Advisory Council, National Tourism and Aviation Advisory Committee, AAA Tourism Industry Advisory Forum, Mass Gatherings Infrastructure Assurance Advisory Group, Australian Customs Service Passenger Facilitation Taskforce (Aviation and Tourism Industry). Further to this, the AHA has also held seats on the board of Tourism Australia. AHA NSW =Drunkenness and hooliganism= In May 2010 the AHA (NSW) CEO Sally Fielke said it would support reintroducing the old Summary Offences Act that gave police powers to crack down on street offences, drunkenness and hooliganism. It was reported that \\"anyone convicted of an alcohol-related anti-social behaviour offence could be banned from entering licensed venues under a radical proposal from the AHA.\\" The Sun- Herald newspaper claimed that the NSW State Government was considering a plea by the pub industry to introduce British-style booze legislation to stem the violence epidemic in pubs and turn responsibility back on to individuals. =Hotels paying former politicians= The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) in 2010 alleged that one of the most senior figures in the NSW Liberal Party, Michael Photios, was being paid by the Australian Hotels Association NSW branch to provide advice in anticipation of the Coalition winning government in the next NSW State Election. These political links to the industry body emerged a week after the paper revealed the former Labor health minister Reba Meagher is also on its payroll as a lobbyist and as the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced an inquiry into political lobbying in NSW. In 2010 the SMH reported that less than two years after she quit state parliament, the former health minister Reba Meagher had returned as a lobbyist for the NSW branch of the AHA. Meagher listed her new company, RPM Counsel, of which she is the sole director, in Parliament's register of lobbyists. She names as a client the Australian Hotels Association (NSW), which is campaigning against the extension of licensing restrictions in pubs to address alcohol-related violence. Among Ms Meagher's final duties as health minister in 2008 was the launch of a responsible drinking campaign aimed at young people. =The NSW AHA and political donations= The AHA is considered one of the most influential lobby groups in Australia, and the AHA NSW Branch provides considerable financial support to the Australian Labor Party. Between 1998 and 2006, the AHA NSW Branch contributed over A$700,000 to the NSW branch of the ALP. In April 2008 the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the AHA NSW had frozen all political donations. The association's new president, Scott Leach, announced the decision to freeze the donations 2 weeks after his election as president. Mr Leach said \\"the move was part of a review of how the association operated. Political donations made by the AHA are under review - we've pressed the pause button.\\"Andrew Clennell, \\"Pubs turn off the political donations tap\\" 2008-04-24 However, the AHA (NSW) donations declaration lodged with the NSW Electoral Funding Authority in February 2009 showed that its political contributions had resumed the next month in May 2008, with donations to political parties between May 2008 and December 2008 reaching nearly $100,000. The AHA (NSW) made another $81,317 in donations to political parties in the period of January 2009 to 30 June 2009, bringing contributions in the period from Leach's announcement to the end of June 2008 to over $180,000, twice as high as the average annual donations made in the 8 years preceding leach's election to the AHA Presidency. In 2010, in anticipation of a Coalition victory in the next state election, donations to the Coalition rose, while those to Labor fell. =AHA NSW CEO= Sally Fielke, a solicitor and former CEO of the Northern Territory AHA commenced as the CEO of the AHA NSW in March 2008 at the age of 34 becoming the first female CEO of the AHA NSW.http://www.crikey.com.au/2008/03/06/time-gentlemen-changing-of-the-guard- at-aha/ Not happy with the level of publicity around issues of Poker machines, smoking, drinking and political donations, Sally Fielke created headlines for herself by engaging in stunts such as writing to Danish Royal, Princess Mary, to ask her to be the patron of their Foundation Race Day at Rosehill races. Sally reportedly told her: \\"Given your well-publicised meeting with the Crown Prince at one of our member venues, the Slip Inn, the hotel industry in NSW certainly has a soft spot for you and the Crown Prince.\\" Sally also told an industry online video publicationhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7tNOP5AwNc that she took interest in reading Hitler's Mein Kampf. AHA WA =Alcohol ID card= The CEO of the AHA (WA) Bradley Woods has confirmed that the organisation supports the introduction of alcohol identification cards to try to reduce alcohol-related problems in Western Australia's Kimberley region, saying that \\"the system can measure and restrict the flow of alcohol and would be more effective than takeaway liquor bans\\".http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/12/2568138.htm It also announced its support for a voluntary alcohol ban among pregnant women in the Kimberley to assist and reduce the rate of babies born with foetal alcohol syndrome.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/29/2529023.htm The proposals were opposed by WA Public Health lobbyists who preferred more funding and resources for research. In 2015 the Shire of Wyndham and East Kymberley with funding support from the Commonwealth Government finally commenced an alcohol ID card purchase system. This initiative, introduced by the Kununurra and Wyndham Alcohol Accord, aims at reducing crime, violence and anti-social behaviour within the community due to the misuse of alcohol.

Created by head writers Lynn Marie Latham and Kay Alden, the role is currently portrayed by Hunter King. The character was introduced during the episode airing on December 19, 2006, as the daughter of Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), but for one year was believed to be the daughter of Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) because of Sharon's tampering with the paternity test results. The role was first portrayed by a series of child actors, including Samantha Bailey. In 2012, the character was rapidly aged to a teenager, with actress Lindsay Bushman assuming the role. However, Bushman was let go months into her debut and replaced by King. Summer was later involved in a cyberbullying plot with Fenmore Baldwin (Max Ehrich) and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Bailey has received critical acclaim for her portrayal, which has garnered her a Young Artist Award. King has also received critical acclaim for her portrayal, which has garnered nominations for a Young Artist Award and two Daytime Emmy Awards. King won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2015 for her role as Summer. Casting The role was initially portrayed by various sets of twins. They included Elara and Rhea Kerwin (nieces of director James Kerwin) from December 29, 2006 to June 20, 2008, Bianca and Chiara D'Ambrosio from July 22 to November 12, 2008, and Sophia and Angelia Hert until 2009. The character was then rapidly aged for the first time, with child actress Samantha Bailey assuming the role on June 9, 2009. Bailey made her final appearance on May 4, 2012. On May 11, 2012, it was announced the Lindsay Bushman had been cast in the role of the teenage Summer. Bushman made her first appearance on June 8, 2012 on a recurring basis. Bushman had a small bit role on General Hospital as a young Kate Howard in a flashback. Bushman revealed that she got the audition thanks to her agent and booked the role after a few callbacks and chemistry reads. With the installation of new executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, rumors began to circulate that a lot of cast members were in danger of being released or replaced. Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada announced the news of Bushman's departure in his magazine, Soap Opera Uncensored in September 2012. Bushman's tweet in response to her firing hinted that she would be replaced by Hunter King formerly of Hollywood Heights, which was also run by Griffith and Phelps. Bushman expressed her frustrations about being replaced on Twitter, saying: \\"The Young and the Restless is being invaded by Hollywood Heights\\", referring to Robert Adamson joining the cast as Kevin Schmidt's replacement. King began taping on September 20, immediately after the announcement about Bushman's departure. King made her debut on a recurring status on October 15, 2012. King revealed that she got a voice mail from executive producer Jill Farren Phelps shortly after getting off a flight. Phelps offered her the role and said she would start working in just two days. King admitted that she felt pressure because she stepped into the role during such a critical storyline but said the encouragement from fans really helped. In March 2013, after six months on a recurring status, King was placed on contract. She stated she was \\"so excited\\" and that she had been \\"waiting and waiting\\" for a contract because she \\"loves working with everybody on the show\\". On June 3, 2016, Deadline reported that King reverted to recurring status with the soap, due to being upgraded to a series regular on Life in Pieces. King last appeared on December 16, 2016. On May 23, 2018, TVLine announced King's full-time return; her return aired on June 4, 2018. Due to King's commitment to Life In Pieces, the role was temporarily recast with actress Bayley Corman, who aired from October 1 to 4, 2018. King temporarily left the show on November 29, 2018 and returned a few months later on January 29, 2019. Development =Characterization= With the decision to age the character, Summer was described as \\"fun\\" and \\"feisty,\\" and the \\"typical\\" teenager. Bushman said that Summer would definitely be a trouble maker much like her mother. Though Summer is definitely like her mom, \\"she has a bit more morals\\" like her father and often disapproves when her mother does something wrong. When comparing Summer to her former Hollywood Heights role, Adriana Masters, whom she described as a \\"mean girl,\\" King explained that there are a lot of factors in Summer's life that lead her to trouble. King described the character as \\"sweet\\" but also a little \\"rebellious.\\" When compared to Adriana, King said Summer is a bit more \\"softhearted.\\" However, King said that it helped that she was still a teenager herself, and explained that Summer like most teenagers can go \\"0 to 100 in your range of emotions.\\" According to King, Summer can be very \\"angsty and stubborn\\" but also at times, Summers begins to open and shows vulnerability. =Teenage years and cyber bullying= In April 2012, it was announced that the role of Summer would be rapidly aged along with Fenmore Baldwin, the son of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). The two child characters would be rapidly aged to teenagers. Because of who their parents are, MSN Entertainment stated that Summer and Fenmore's new lives as teenagers would definitely have great story potential. Bushman responded, \\"You get what you give, right?\\" referring to Summer's parents, mainly her mother often causing trouble for everyone. Summer reacts to her parents transgressions by acting out including trying to drink vodka with Fenmore (Max Ehrich). However, according to Bushman, Phyllis's actions push Summer to such extremes. If her life was stable, Summer would not find reasons to act out. Her mother's affair with Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson) is what justifies actions in her mind. Bushman said that at Summer's age, it is difficult to deal with an unstable family and all Summer's knows how to do is act out to get attention. The recast occurred at the peak of Summer's rebellion storyline which culminates in Summer causing a car accident which leads to her uncle Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) and his wife Chelsea (Melissa Claire Egan) miscarrying their unborn child. In November 2012, Summer was involved in a storyline where she would create a fake online persona, \\"Brittni\\" on a social media website to get information from Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo), a boy being mentored by Genoa City cop Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson) who was involved with Phyllis. Speaking on the show's cyber bully plot, head-writer Joshua Griffith stated: \\"Summer is in such a screwed-up state over the divorce of her parents that she misguidedly decides to hurt Ronan by hurting this kid he cares so much about She uses her phony online persona called 'Brittni' to form a relationship with Jamie and draw information out of him ‚Äî deeply personal and hurtful stuff about his past troubles with the law ‚Äî and then she blasts it out to everyone on FacePlace. She'll also be using texting and instant messaging to disparage him further.\\" Simultaneously, Summer starts really getting to know Jamie, and \\"She realizes he's a kid who's had a really terrible life and that she's doing things to him he doesn't deserve,\\" explained head writer, Josh Griffith in an interview with TV Guide. Summer even uses Fenmore's crush on her to get him to go along with her plan to hurt Ronan by hurting Jamie. But, when Fen becomes aware of Summer's growing soft spot for Jamie, he gets jealous which leads to Jamie attempting suicide. Summer feels sorry for her actions when she realizes that Jamie comes from a broken home just like she does. Summer stops the attacks and tries to support Jamie instead of making matters worse. Summer realizes what she did wrong and King hoped viewers would see that Summer was making progress. =Paternity= In a 2010 interview with TV Guide, Morrow openly discussed his strong belief that Summer was not Nick's child due to the fact that Nick was suffering from amnesia at the time. Though the actor himself questioned Summer's paternity, it seemed nothing would come of his speculation. In October 2012, Bushman hinted that she would not be opposed to a potential romance with Kyle Abbott (then Blake Hood). In February 2013, King's version of Summer is scripted as being 18 years old, and the character has developed a major crush on Kyle. Nick's immediate disapproval hinted that there was more to his disapproval then just the slight age difference between the two characters. Because Nick is the only person to see the test results, many viewers have begun to speculate that Jack could indeed be Summer's biological father. Summer's crush on Kyle reminds them of the possibility that they could be brother and sister. With the installation of Josh Griffith as head writer, in addition to Nick's adamant disapproval of Summer's crush on Kyle, Jack even brings up the night he helped deliver Summer in the elevator. According to Griffith, Nick is so protective because he knows about Jack's playboy history during his younger years. He stated: \\"Nick's worried that Summer is going to get involved with someone who could break her heart.\\" Despite Griffith's explanation, King herself questioned Summer's paternity; \\"I ask Josh everyday, 'Whose daughter am I?\\" Though Griffith does not confirm or deny anything, he explained that anything is possible. In May 2013, Nick takes a look at the paternity test results from 2006, this time showing viewers that the results were inconclusive. The storyline coincides with the memorial of the death of Nick's daughter, Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes), and he visits her grave and admits that he is terrified about losing another daughter. Joshua Morrow admitted in an interview with TV Guide that the writers make it clear that Nick did not intend to do anything wrong. He stated that Nick \\"refused to do another test\\". Morrow admits that Nick may have never thought about the possibility of Jack being Summer's father again had Summer not fallen so hard for Kyle to point where she admits that she would like to lose her virginity to him. He said that \\"people don't know what to think\\" of Nick's \\"threatening Kyle\\" and reasons to \\"ground Summer\\". On May 27, 2013, Morrow did an interview TV Buzz which confirmed that Summer is indeed Jack's daughter, and according to the actor, Nick is terrified of Summer's reaction. However, months later it was revealed that the paternity test results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, \\"I'm very curious as to how they're going to play it out with Summer. I'm sure she's still going to have the close bond that she now has with Jack.\\" Storylines Around the time Summer is conceived, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow) is grieving the loss of his adopted daughter, Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes), the victim of a car accident. With his marriage to wife Sharon (Sharon Case) falling apart, Nick begins an affair with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman)'s girlfriend, Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) in December 2005. Despite the affair, there is still a possibility that the unborn child could be Jack's. They order a paternity test but the actual copy of the results is only viewed by Nick; not even viewers see the document. However, Nick announces that he is Summer's father and marries Phyllis. Summer is born in an elevator at Newman Enterprises and delivered by Jack Abbott during an ice storm on December 19, 2006. As infants, Summer and Fenmore are abducted by Sheila Carter (Stafford) who had gotten plastic surgery to look like Phyllis. Fortunately, Summer and Fen survive. A few years later, when Phyllis is sent to prison, Summer becomes ill and must move in with Nick. Two years later, Summer ends up in the hospital when Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk) gives her a kiss after eating a peanut butter cookie. Phyllis is accused of trying to kill Summer to win back Nick. Summer goes into anaphylactic shock, and is left comatose. When she wakes up, Summer has the mindset of a toddler due to brain swelling and trouble breathing. She undergoes therapy in Switzerland, and later returns a recovered young girl. After appearing sporadically for several years, Summer (Lindsay Bushman) becomes a moody teenager, and develops a friendship with Fenmore (Max Ehrich). She is briefly employed as a camp counselor and becomes intertwined with her mother's past. When Phyllis is accused of the attempted murder of Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell) and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Summer believes her mother is innocent and confronts Christine over the matter. However, when Phyllis begins going to extremes to cover up her actions, going so far as making up a \\"fake\\" affair with Ronan Malloy, Summer's parents cannot tell her the truth, leading her to rebel by attempting to pour vodka into a drink in a public place. Phyllis' lies become too much for Nick to handle, so he moves out and Summer goes with him. She is then convinced to make repairs in her relationship with her mother, only to walk in on Phyllis and Ronan actually having sex. Afterward, she bashes Ronan's car and gets arrested, and is grounded by Nick. Later she sneaks out of the house with Fenmore where they share a kiss. Summer returns for her mother's trial, and expresses her hatred for Phyllis. She then had an array of emotions while driving, leading to a collision with Adam and Chelsea Newman. Following the car crash, Summer (Hunter King) quickly recovers, however the accident causes Chelsea to miscarry her unborn child, leaving Summer guilt ridden. As payback for Ronan ruining her family, Summer joins a social network under the alias \\"Brittni,\\" whom she uses to romance Jamie, a boy who is being mentored by Ronan. \\"Brittni\\" instant messages Jamie over the internet and gets him to reveal the crimes he committed and how he met Ronan and in turn posts them all over the internet to embarrass Jamie, and Ronan by extension. However, Summer begins to feel sorry for Jamie and decides to stop tormenting Jamie; however a jealous Fen continues and his actions lead to Jamie's suicide attempt. After the fall out, Summer does her best to rebuild her life and starts crushing on Kyle Abbott, son of her mother's current boyfriend and ex-husband, Jack. Nick is absolutely against the relationship but Summer continues to do things to get Kyle's attention. She also starts working as an intern at Jabot Cosmetics, Jack's company where Kyle also works. Summer seems to be winning Kyle over when she is hired as a model for Jabot's fashion division and to complicate matters further, she and Phyllis move into the Abbott mansion. Instead of going to prom with Fen, she and best friend Courtney (Kelli Goss) throw a party at Phyllis's penthouse; when Fen kisses Summer on a dare, Summer tricks Kyle into coming to her rescue. Kyle admits that a relationship with Summer would not be so bad much to Nick's dismay. Summer plans to lose her virginity to Kyle on the night of her graduation and Phyllis tries to talk her out of it, but doesn't go through with it. For the years following Summer's birth, speculation arose that Jack was in fact Summer's father, not Nick. In the summer of 2013, it was revealed that the paternity test conducted in 2006 was inconclusive. A second paternity test was run by Nick and the results show that Jack is Summer's father. However, Sharon now wants Nick back, and tampers with the test results, allowing everyone to believe Jack is now the father of Summer. Phyllis ultimately hears Sharon confessing to this at Cassie's grave, resulting in an altercation between the two and ending with Phyllis falling down a flight of stairs. Following Phyllis' accident, Summer begins working in modeling. Esmeralda (Briana Nicole Henry), a longtime model, interacts with Summer at a Jabot Cosmetics photo shoot, and afterward offers her the phone number of her drug dealer for energy pills. Eventually, Summer takes three pills in order to stay awake during the shoot after waking up early. Summer, who begins to breathe heavily, leaves the shoot to get air. Summer's breathing begins to get worse so she calls Fenmore, who breaks his house arrest to find her. Fenmore shows up at the shoot looking for Summer where he interacts with Sharon and Esmeralda. Sharon and Esmeralda went down the stairwell looking for her where they find Summer at the bottom of the stairwell. At the hospital, the doctor tells Sharon, Jake and Nick that she was having Cardiac arrest episodes and suffering from High output heart failure. Summer comes with support from Nick and eventually returns home. Afterwards, Summer visits Fenmore in jail after he was arrested for breaking house arrest. In the absence of Phyllis, Summer began connecting with her aunt, Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins). In the summer of 2014, Summer began to developed a serious romantic relationship with her aunt Avery Bailey Clark's camera man Austin Travers (Matthew Atkinson). After Austin reveals to Summer that he kidnapped her aunt and accidentally shot police chief Paul Williams, Summer insists on helping him get to the Canada‚ÄìUS border where they became fugitives, however Austin leaves Summer behind and returns to Genoa City and turns himself in. After turning himself in to the police, Summer finds a lawyer to represent him, even asking Avery to do it before Leslie Michaelson takes the case and Summer bails him out. Summer and Austin ultimately elope so Summer wouldn't be forced to testify against him in court. In conclusion, Summer decides she wants to have a traditional wedding in a church with family and friends, much to the displeasure of Summer's family members and friends, in particularly Jack who attempts to get the marriage null and void, by even going as far as having her arrested. However, thanks to the support from Sharon and Jack's girlfriend Kelly Andrews, Nick and Jack both come to the wedding which is broken up by the police and attempt to arrest Austin. After convincing Avery, her uncle Dylan and Paul agree to not press charges leading Austin only receiving a fine to pay, which Summer pays from her trust fund. Tension quickly rose on their union as Summer became more jealous when Austin develops a friendship with Cassie's twin sister Mariah Copeland, whom she strongly dislikes. When Summer's mother recovers from her coma, Summer introduces Austin as her friend, upsetting Austin with Summer claiming that the doctor is requiring her family not to give upsetting or shocking information to Phyllis. Phyllis learns from Summer that the two are \\"engaged\\" and is enraged; but not as enraged when she learns the two are married and Austin is a felon. Phyllis sees the relationship is blossoming so Phyllis agrees to ease up and leave them be. Months later, it is revealed to Summer that Sharon switched her paternity results. Summer and Austin once again face relationship problems, when Summer learns Mariah kissed Austin. On Valentine's Day 2015, Abby Newman invites Summer, Austin, Mariah, Kevin Fisher, Fenmore, Noah, and Courtney to the Abbott Cabin. After Fenmore spiked Abby's punch everyone falls asleep. After Kevin wakes up, so does everyone else to discover that Austin is missing. Kevin searches outside in an intense snowstorm and finds nothing. While the group is talking about Austin's possible whereabouts Austin falls out of a wardrobe and after Courtney (a police officer) tries to revive a unresponsive Austin, she declares that he is dead. Later it is discovered that Austin was having an affair with Summer's aunt Abby, leaving Summer heartbroken and confused as she is grieving for her husband and mad that he cheated on her. Kyle also has come back to town and revealed that he first came back to confront Austin about his affair with Abby leaving Summer angry that Kyle didn't first tell her. However, Summer forgives Kyle and he continues comforting her over her loss. Then the person who killed Austin begins threatening Summer, Kyle, Noah, Courtney, and Abby. As time goes by, they keep looking for the killer which causes the killer to strike again - this time killing Courtney on her wedding day before she was to marry Noah. This leaves Summer heartbroken as she has now lost her husband and best friend, and so Kyle remains by her side to help her in her grieving. Summer suspects Sharon as the killer, which causes a rift between her and Noah. Later, Summer attends a party with Kyle to get her mind off of everything. After the party at her house, Summer talks about Courtney then tells Kyle that she can't keep dragging Kyle into her misery but Kyle says that that's what he is here for and that they were family for a little while at least but Summer says she doesn't look at him and see a brother and Kyle says he's not and he never was. Summer looks at Kyle and says no you weren't. Kyle and Summer look deeply at each other and then kiss, which leads to them making love for the first time. Afterwards Summer tells Kyle that it feels so good to be with him. They both also say it feels so natural being with each other even after they were told that it was unnatural. Summer says that it was unfair that they were kept apart because of Sharon's lie. Then Noah sees them and gets mad because Kyle took advantage of Summer. After Noah leaves Kyle tells Summer not to feel ashamed, that what they did isn't wrong and that Noah is just grieving. Later Summer and Noah make up and he apologizes. Sharon is arrested soon after as evidence points to her. Noah defends her but Summer continues to believe she is guilty. Summer returns to Genoa City in June 2018, much to the surprise of Phyllis and Billy. Immediately, she makes her presence known in Genoa City, only to eventually be arrested for charges of felony theft auto; when bailed out, she explains she believed the car to be a gift from \\"Pax,\\" with whom she was having affair with. Summer returns to town with resent towards her mother, Phyllis Summers. Summer takes a liking in Billy Abbott (although he is with her mother), and begins to make subtle, but unpleasant plays for him, such as wearing lingerie around the house, and getting Billy to give into his gambling addiction. Summer suspects trouble in Billy and Phyllis‚Äôs relationship, and enlists the help of Kyle Abbott to figure out what it is. Summer and Kyle initially suspect that her and Kyle‚Äôs father Jack Abbott slept together, however it is later revealed that Phyllis slept with Summers father, Nick Newman, while her and Billy were on a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù. Summer uses this to her advantage, and makes Nick give her a payout. Later, Summer and her mother fight about Billy, and Summer confesses to having feelings for him, as they kissed. Phyllis slaps Summer, which sends Summer to find Billy. However, Phyllis sends a text message using Billy‚Äôs I.D, for Summer to meet him on a boat. Summer takes the bait, and gets herself stuck on the boat. Weeks later, Summer accidentally exposes the secret to Mariah Copeland, who later tells Sharon of the affair, causing her to end her relationship to Nick, and Billy ending his relationship to Phyllis. In an act of retaliation against Phyllis, Billy sleeps with Summer, however he soon confesses to it being a act against Phyllis, and nothing more. Summer temporarily moves to Dubai, however later returns in late January of the next year, causing trouble between Kyle and his new girlfriend, Lola Rosales. After Lola experiences an altercation with former sister in Mia Rosales, she‚Äôs in need of a liver transplant, and Summer is the only compatible donor. She uses this to force Kyle into marrying her, only for him to divorce her soon after the transplant surgery takes place. She later becomes an influencer for Jabot Cosmetics, and starts a relationship with GC newcomer Theo Vanderway. Reception Jillian Bowe of Zap2it was surprised by the decision to age both Summer and Fenmore at the same time. Soaps In Depth said, \\"A wave of SORAS has hit Genoa City!\\" in response to the announcement that Bushman had joined the cast. TV Source Magazine said, \\"Don‚Äôt they grow up fast?\\", referring to the genre's knack for aging young character's very quickly. Dan J. Kroll of the website Soap Central commented, \\"Two more Genoa City residents growing up too fast.\\" The series had just rapidly aged Kyle Abbott and Ricky Williams. Michael Fairman said aging the characters would help to \\"beef up\\" the show's summer storylines. Bushman's acting coach took to Twitter to congratulate the actress on booking the role. When Bushman was let go from the soap opera, Jamey Giddens, also of Zap2it, said: \\"Another blonde actress who plays a member of The Young and the Restless' fictional Newman clan has been let go\\", in reference to Marcy Rylan's recent firing from the role of Abby Newman. Giddens also recommended another Hollywood Heights actress, Brittany Underwood, for the role. The news of King's casting did not come as a surprise due to Phelps and Griffith's ties to Hollywood Heights and previous casting decisions. Zap2it referred to Bushman's portrayal of Summer as \\"annoying\\" following the announcement of her departure. King's performance received praise very early on. King ranked at number one on Zap2it's list of \\"Top 5 Soap Opera Newcomers\\". King was applauded for giving \\"a dose of much-need, angsty teen spirit\\". The article said King completely transformed the character from \\"a vapid, little nothing into a pretty little liar\\", and that King could easily hold her own up against acting veterans. Soap Opera Digest gave King's casting a \\"Thumbs Up!\\" and said that the decision was a \\"winning move\\". The magazine also applauded Bushman for her \\"adequate\\" portrayal of Summer, but said that King \\"blends the right amount of brooding teen angst and vulnerability to creat a compelling character\\" that can make viewers angry because of her decisions, but also makes viewers \\"sympathize with her\\". The magazine also thought King's skill as an actress made the transition \\"seamless\\". Max Ehrich, who portrays Fenmore, said Bushman's ousting was \\"bitter sweet\\" but noted that he also enjoyed working with King. King admitted that she has to \\"clarify that I'm not the character\\" to fans whenever Summer is being manipulative. Bailey's performance earned her the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Daytime TV Series - Young Actress beating Kings's performance in the role. King was also nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2013, losing out to Kristen Alderson before winning the following year, beating out Alderson, Linsey Godfrey, Kim Matula and Kelly Missal. Viewers have often questioned Summer's paternity. On March 21, 2013, Zap2it ran a poll asking fans if they believed Summer was an Abbott or a Newman, and an overwhelming 76% (1,928 voters) concluded that Summer was an Abbott.

The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Samson, one of the founding saints of Brittany. It was formerly the seat of the Archbishop of Dol, one of the nine ancient bishoprics of Brittany. The cathedral suffered badly from the excesses of the French Revolution, becoming successively a \\"Temple de la Raison\\", then a stable, then a warehouse. Revolutionaries caused considerable damage and many treasures were lost. When it eventually returned to being a house of worship, its role as a bishopric was abolished by the Concordat of 1801 when the Dol diocese was merged into the Dioceses of Rennes and Saint- Malo. The Concordat of 1801 was an agreement between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII, signed on 15 July 1801 in Paris, which sought national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics. The Concordat was abrogated by the law of 1905 on the separation of church and state. The building is notable for its eclectic mix of styles and idiosyncrasies, such as the incomplete north tower on the main west-facing entrance. The tower was begun in 1520 but never finished due to lack of funds. A local myth has it that the top was knocked off by the devil, who threw the nearby Dol-de-Bretagne menhir at the building. The seat of the ancient bishopric of Dol, the Saint-Samson cathedral dates to the 13th-century and is primarily Gothic in style with both Norman and English influences. It was built on the site of an old church where Nomino√´ was crowned as the first king of Brittany in 850. This old church was replaced by a Romanesque style cathedral which was in turn destroyed in 1203 by the soldiers of Jean sans Terre and little is left of that building today. From Saint Samson in the 6th century to Monseigneur de Herc√©, shot at Vannes in 1795, more than 80 bishops have occupied the bishopric of Dol. Since 1880 the Archbishop of Rennes is the Archbishop of Rennes, Dol and Saint-Malo. The cathedral has retained little of the old furnishings as in 1742 the cathedral chapter decided to get rid of all the old bishop's tombs and relaid the choir paving and in 1793 the rood screen which had separated the choir from the nave was demolished and was replaced by an iron grill on the orders of the zealots of the revolution. Samson was born in Wales at the end of the 5th century. He became a monk and was the superior of a monastery in Caldey. He moved to Ireland and in around 548 made the journey to Armorica with several colleagues and founded a monastery there. Later, with the support of the Breton king Judicael, he played a key role in the foundation of the city of Dol and its bishopric. He died in 565 in Dol having nominated Magloire as his successor and his tomb was to become the destination of numerous pilgrims and is included in the Breton Tro Breizh. One of the stained glass window frames in the cathedral depicts Samson sailing for Armorica (\\"Saint Samson fait voile vers l'Armorique\\"). Landmarks in the cathedral's history It was in 548 that Samson arrived in Dol from Wales and founded a monastery there and in 555 that Judael, the Breton king, directed that the monastery be regarded as a bishopric. After the coronation of Nomino√´, the Breton ruler in 848, he promoted the bishop to archbishop and the city became the religious capital of Brittany (\\"la M√©tropole eccl√©siastique de la Bretagne\\") and soon a cathedral replaced the existing church. This was destroyed by the Vikings in 1014. A Romanesque cathedral was then built. In the middle of the eleventh century there was a dispute between Pope Gregory VII and the Kings of France supported by the Archbishop of Tours over Dol-de-Bretagne filling the role of a bishopric and in 1199 the bishopric was withdrawn and jurisdiction was returned to the Archbishop of Tours. Nomino√´'s actions were effectively reversed. William the Conqueror laid siege to Dol on three occasions. In 1065, William the Conqueror was in conflict with Conan II who had succeeded Alain III and laid siege to Dol. This siege is depicted in part of the Bayeux tapestry. A second siege took place in 1076 and lasted 40 days until the intervention of King Philippe Ist. A third siege is said to have taken place in 1086. In 1203, the English king, John Lackland, known in France as \\"Jean sans Terre\\" and the murderer of Arthur de Bretagne burned the Romanesque cathedral down and occupied Dol for one year; there are few remnants of that building. Then, fearing for his soul and in a fit of remorse, he put up funds towards the cathedral's reconstruction which was started the same year under the episcopacy of the bishop Jean VII de Lizaunet. In a small corner of the south tower, there is a carving depicting \\"Jean sans Terre\\" bearing a rictus grin. He was certainly no friend of the people of Dol. By 1223, the nave had been completed and subsequently, the relics of Saint Samson were brought back to the cathedral from Normandy to where they had been taken for reasons of security. The nave has seven crossings and the classical gothic elevation of arcades, triforium and high windows with a walkway beneath them. De Lizaunet's successor Cl√©ment de Vitr√© (known as Cl√©ment de Coetquen or de Coetquin) saw to the construction of the transept and the choir. The choir has five crossings and ten side chapels and terminates with a rectangular chevet. The presence of the relics of saint Samson attracted pilgrims and this necessitated the addition of an ambulatory. The choir, ambulatory and ten side chapels around the ambulatory were completed by 1279. The cathedral was now functional although it's Gothic towers had still to be constructed. The porches on the south side of the cathedral were added in the 14th and 15th century. At around this time, the chapter-house and treasury were also added. Stendhal described the cathedral as \\"un des vouvrages les plus remarquables que l'architecture gothique puisse offrir √† notre admiration\\".

In the 15th-century Bishop Coeuret had the vaulting erected on intersecting ogival arches. The trefoiled doors within the porch give access to the cathedral. The measurements of the porch are 6 metres 20 by 7 metres 60. The keystone on the porch's vaulting bears the Coeuret coat of arms. The cathedral's \\"Grand Porch\\", also known as the \\"Chapitret\\" or the \\"Porche Saint-Magloire\\", consists of three arcades decorated with 38 bas- reliefs and 132 statuettes in white stone by the Prix de Rome winner Jean Boucher (artist). The doorway itself is made from granite and dates to the 14th-century. The central arcade shows scenes from the life of Christ: The Calvary; Jesus healing a sick man; Jesus amongst the lawyers; the agony in the garden of Gethsemane; Mater Dolorosa (Our Lady of Sorrows); Simon of Cyrene; the Adoring Angels; the \\"Sainte-Face\\" (the face of Christ) and Adam and Eve (A copy of the bas-relief at Notre-Dame de Paris) The east facing arcade by the well shows scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary: Mary carrying the baby Jesus; the flight into Egypt; the coronation; the Visitation; the Annunciation; the Nativity and the Annunciation to the shepherds. The west facing arcade shows scenes from the history of Bretagne: the death of Saint Samson; the calling of Judicael; the arrest of Sainte-Catherine; Charity; the blessing of Nominoe as he departs for the crusades; a Dol saint receiving a visit from several people one of whom carries a plea to the king; the martyrdom of Sainte Catherine and the good and the bad rich man.

This was replaced by a much grander porch in the 15th century which was decorated at the end of the 19th century with biblical relief carvings by the sculptor Jean Boucher including the tree of Jesse (Arbre de Jess√©). A coat of arms in the tympanum depicts three hearts and is the arms of bishop C≈ìuret (1405-1429) who instigated the 15th-century replacement. The porch has a triangular pediment with two ogival arcades resting on colonnettes. The interior is decorated with ogival arcades, rose windows and white stone carved with foliage. The porch measures 3 metres 70 by 3 metres 20.

Construction of the tower started in 1520 during the episcopy of Mathurin de Pl√©dran (1504-1521) but the tower was not completed due to a lack of funds. Only four stories were built plus the ground floor. The tower is supported by two large buttresses and each of its four floors is lit by two small windows with a frieze above carved in the manner of a lambrequin. =The south tower= The South Tower The south tower was built between the 13th and 17th centuries. It has four stories including the ground floor and is 52 metres high. The bell-tower (campanile) dates to the 17th century. The cathedral interior =The nave= The nave has seven bays of which six have side-aisles. It has five great arcades surmounted by a triforium and a clerestory: the traditional gothic elevation. =The transepts= The centre of the transept is formed by four Gothic arcs de triomphe. The north transept has a window dedicated to sainte Anne and the south transept has a window dedicated to saint Magloire. The north transept holds the tombs of Thomas James and Jean de Bruc. =The Choir= Completed in 1265 when Monseigneur Jean Mah√© started his bishopric. =The Chevet= The cathedral chevet opens onto the ambulatory through two arches. In a niche in the chevet area, there is a small statue of the Virgin Mary with child. =The stalls= The 77 oak stalls furnishing the choir date to the early 14th-century and are the oldest and most important in Brittany. The carvings are on the arm-rests of each stall rather than as at Tr√©guier and Saint Pol where they decorate the mis√©ricords. At Dol, the wood-carvers have carved what is almost a complete cross section of the medieval population of the town. =The cathedral lay- out= The cathedral is best entered by the west porch and portal with the north tower on the left and south tower to the right. The cathedral's so- called \\"small porch\\" is located in the south nave. Also in the south nave and just before the south transept is the former chapter house and the chapels of saint Magloire and the Holy Sacrament. The tomb of Thomas James is located in the north transept. Around the choir are ten chapels. Along the north side of the choir are the chapel of Saint Coeur, the chapel of saints Gilles and Roch, the chapel of saints Gilduin and M√©en and the chapel of the Holy Virgin and along the south side are the sacristy, then the chapels of saints Joseph and Theresa, the chapel of Saint Michael, the chapel of Our Lady of Pity and the chapel of the Crucifix. Just before the south transept is the baptistry and the south transept is essentially the Great Porch. At the eastern end of the cathedral is the apsidal chapel, the chapel of saint Samson. =The Bishop's throne= In the choir area there is a bishop's throne or cathedra dating to the 16th-century. It bears the arms of Bishop Fran√ßois de Laval, the sitting bishop at Dol from 1528 to 1556. Above the chair there is a finely carved crook which used to stand behind the High Altar in the 18th-century. It was fashioned by a Rouen sculptor called Tarl√©. =The High Altar= The \\"ma√Ætre- autel\\" The cathedral has two High Altars. One is old and the other very modern. Records do not show when the first High Altar was installed in the cathedral (\\"Ma√Ætre-Autel\\") but in 1410 it was recorded that Monseigneur √âtienne Coeuret commissioned the Rennes sculptor Pierre Picart to create columns around the existing High Altar these bearing coats of arms and angels holding the instruments of the passion. Near this altar and under a baldaquin the relics of saint Samson were placed. Above this was a cross holding the \\"pyxide\\" which held the ciborium. This altar disappeared in 1744 and a new High Altar was installed, this at the instigation of Monseigneur Jean-Louis de Bouschet de Sourches. It was the work of the Laval atelier of Maurice Pierlet and Honor√© Pinc√©. In 1877, a completely new High Altar was installed this by the goldsmiths Poussi√®lgue-Rusand based on a design by Canon Brune. Since 1980 a completely new altar and ambo is in use, this placed in the centre of the transept. This altar is the work of Claude Gruer and is made from refractory clay and was carved directly without the use of a mould. Cuboid in form, the main faces of the altar are decorated with images of the Last supper and another of Christ being taken down from the cross. On the secondary faces are depictions of saint Samson crossing the channel and saint Magloire pacifying English soldiers. It was Abb√© Jules Orri√®re who pushed for this altar to be commissioned. =Pulpit= View of the pulpit from the rear The oak pulpit was carved by the Augerie de Vitr√© atelier in 1898. It was commissioned by Fran√ßois-Joseph Turmel. The panels of the pulpit are decorated with five bas- reliefs and six statuettes depicting the great Dol saints. =The Great Organ and Organ loft= Records show that in 1575 the organ was in a state of decay although the wooden framework and the organ loft panelling date to 1579. Between 1650 and 1654 repairs were undertaken by the organ manufacturer Henri Vaignon from Normandy. The cathedral's current organ was inaugurated in 1979 and over the years the instrument was subjected to many repairs and restorations. In 1877, a new organ had been manufactured and installed by Maison Debierre of Nantes. In 1931 the organ was electrified and a major restoration took place in 1948 and in 1977 the organ was dismantled and reassembled by 1979. Jean Langlais gave the inauguration concert on 19 April 1979. Between 2014 and 2015 the instrument has been reviewed, after which a new inaugural concert took place on 5 July 2015, given by Pierre Pincemaille in front of 700 people. =The nave aisles= The nave has seven crossings but only six side-aisles due to the towers built on the western extremity of the cathedral. The aisles each have bays in tiers-point with two stained glass windows within an ogival frame. All the windows in the north nave aisles date to the 19th-century except for the first window near the north tower which dates to the 14th-century. Above the two lancets are circular windows and seven of these depict the coats of arms of some of the Dol-de-Bretagne bishops. These date to the 19th century and were made by the Nantes atelier Ely, save for one which is of 16th/17th-century origin and is listed as a \\"Historic monument\\". =Reliquaries= There are two Dutch oak reliquaries in the saint Samson chapel both carved and gilded. They contain relics of saint Samson and saint Magloire. They date to between 1746 and 1747 and are the work of the Rouen sculptor Jean Le Fran√ßois. =The tomb of Thomas James= The many tombs of former Dol bishops disappeared during the French revolution but the tomb of Thomas James, bishop of Dol from 1482 to 1504 survived, albeit mutilated and is located in the north transept. The tomb, which dates to 1507, is the work of the florentine sculptors Antoine Juste (1479-1519) and his brother Jean-Juste (1485-1549). Jean-Juste had created Louis XIII's mausoleum in Paris' Basilique Saint-Denis. It is the oldest example in Brittany of a renaissance work of art. It is decorated with pilasters and carvings representing candelabras, griffons, birds and satyrs. Two medallions on the side of the tomb name two of Thomas James' nephews, Jean and Fran√ßois James also buried here. The inscription reads \\"IOANIS - IAMEZ - IURIU - LAUTI - LEHONII - COMENDAT - DOL - THESAU - ET - CANO - IMPESA - ET - CURA - STRUCTUM - AC - ORNATU - SEPULCRU - M - VCC - VII. The tomb is located in the cathedral's north transept.

There is also a portrait of Monseigneur Dondel. = The chapels in the north ambulatory = The following chapels run along the north ambulatory starting from the north transept and finishing at the cathedral's chevet and the absidial chapel. The first crossing has no lateral chapel.  \\"Chapelle du Sacr√©-C≈ìur\\"  This chapel is dedicated to the \\"Sacr√©-coeur\\". The altar is carved from white stone. The chapel contains several statues. These include the Sacr√©-coeur and statues of saints Peter and Paul by the sculptor Valentin. The chapel windows depict the last supper and the passion as well as the \\"Apparition de Marguerite-Marie\\". The stained glass was the work of the artist Ely in 1874. By a corner of the altar, there is a credence set into the wall. The chapel contains the tomb and cenotaph of Monseigneur l'Abb√© Brignon.  \\"Chapelle saint Gilles et saint Roch\\"  In the chapel dedicated to saint-Gilles and saint-Roch is a 1901 altar with a relief depicting saint Thuriau blessing a barbarian, this executed by the sculptor Augerie. This altar replaced an earlier one carved from wood. The two saints and their virtues, as well as those of saint Martin and saint Hubert are depicted in the stained glass. Statues in the chapel of the two saints are thought to be by Valentin and date to 1876.  \\"Chapelle saint Gilduin et saint M√©en\\"  The chapel is dedicated to saint Gilduin, an archdeacon at Dol who refused the bishopric offered by Pope Gregory VII and saint M√©en who was a disciple of saint Samson. The altar altarpiece and statues are by Jean-Marie Valentin and date to 1873 and the chapel's oil paintings are the work of the Rennes artist Lemoine. The stained glass tells us something of saint Gilduin; his refusal of the bishopric, his illness, his transfer to Notre-Dame in Chartres and his death. They also depict saint M√©en amongst the sick. A reliquary on the altar in gilded bronze contains relics of these two saints. = \\"La Chapelle de la Sainte Vierge\\" and the \\"Sainte Vierge\\" altar = This is a spacious chapel serving the local parish of Crucifix The chapel is vaulted and lit by four windows. The chapel altar is carved from wood and includes a tabernacle and two bas-reliefs, one depicting the \\"Annunciation\\" and the other the \\"Couronnement de la Vierge\\". The altar is possibly the work of Jean-Julien H√©rault and dates to around 1860. The altar is topped by a large statue of the Virgin Mary known as \\"Notre-Dame de Lourdes\\". The altar is surrounded by a railing.  \\"La Chapelle Absidiale\\"  The window in the apsidial chapel We then come to the apsidal chapel which flanks the southern side of the sacristy. The chapel is dedicated to saint Samson and dates to the first half of the 14th-century, being built during the episcopacy of Jean du Bosc (1312‚Äì24). A number of bishops were buried here including du Bosc. The north and south walls have stone benches. There are three large bay windows with stained glass dating to 1859 . These three windows by Ren√© √âchapp√© depict various Dol bishops and under each of these depictions is a small medallion showing an event in that bishop's life. They were all executed in 1859 and take up three of the cathedral's many bays. The first of these windows features four lancets containing depictions of saint Budoc, saint Magloire, saint Samson and saint G√©nev√©. The scene shown under saint Budoc who was the 3rd bishop of Dol depicts Monseigneur Brossais-Saint-Marc being presented by saint Melaine, the 1st bishop of Dol to saint Samson and offering him a window. Beneath saint Magloire who was the 2nd bishop of Dol, the scene shows the Comte de Jersey giving the bishop part of his land. Samson was the 1st Dol bishop and beneath his image, the scene shows Samson studying a plan of the monastery he will have built in the future. Finally under saint G√©nev√© are the arms and motto of Monseigneur Brossais-Saint-Marc. In another window, this comprising three lancets, are depictions of saint Even, saint Leucher and saint Thuriau. Even was the 20th bishop of Dol and in the scene beneath his image, the deacon Gilduin is shown refusing the bishopric and recommending to the Pope that Even is given the post. Leucher was the 4th bishop of Dol and in the scene beneath his image we see Leichet using the cross of saint Samson to put out a fire which threatened the church. Beneath Thuriau's depiction, the scene shows Rivallonqui who had set fire to a Dol run monastery asking Thuriau's pardon. In another of the windows are depictions of Monseigneur R√©vol, Monseigneur Thoreau and Monseigneur de Herc√©. Beneath the image of R√©vol, a bishop is shown blessing the sea, beneath Thoreau a bishop and a man are shown by a water pipe and beneath de Herc√© the scene shows de Herc√© being shot in 1795 with Mr.de Sombreuil. The altar is the work of H√©rault, the Rennes sculptor and was executed in 1859. The absidial chapel also contains the tombs of Jean Louis de Bouschet de Sourches, Mathurin de Pl√©dran, Antoine de R√©vol, Mathieu Thoreau and Jean-Fran√ßois Dondel. = The chapels in the south ambulatory =  \\"Chapelle saint Joseph & sainte Th√©r√®se\\"  In this chapel there is a beautiful carved wooden confessional box and the window has some fragments which date to the 14th century. The altar is wooden with a statue in white stone of saint Joseph. In the 19th-century stained glass window, the depiction is of Margaret of Antioch with a chained demon. This single lancet window dates to 1872 and is by Henry Ely. The window bears the inscription \\"Ste MARGUERITE\\". The chapel is divided into two parts and also contains a statue of sainte Theresa with the baby Jesus which dates to 1928.  \\"La Chapelle St-Michel\\" and the stained glass window depicting saint Sebastian, saint Michel, saint Louis, and the \\"glorification de la Vierge\\" The chapel contains an altar in white stone with statues of saint Michael, saint Sebastian and saint Louis wearing a crown of thorns. In this chapel is another window by Henry Ely which dates to 1876. It comprises 3 lancets and a tympanum. The lancets hold the images of the three saints and the tympanum depicts the Virgin Mary being blessed by Jesus and a group of angels and cherubs. In the lancet dedicated to saint Sebastian scenes include his being pierced by arrows and his being beaten to death with cudgels. In the central lancet scenes include saint Michel fighting the devil and appearing before saint Aubert the founder of Mont-Saint-Michel and in the lancet dedicated to saint Louis, the scenes include Louis transferring relics to the \\"Sainte- Chapelle\\" and his death at Tunis. = \\"Chapelle Notre-Dame-De-La-Piti√©\\" = The altar was previously wooden with twisted columns but was replaced by one made from white stone with a statue of \\"Mater Dolorosa\\". The stained glass window's tympanum depicts \\"L'Adoration de l'agneau\\". This chapel contains a monument, installed in 1920, dedicated to those men of Dol who lost their lives in the 1914-1918 war and sculpted by Andr√© C√©sar Vermare. The scene depicts an apparition of Christ appearing to a soldier (\\"poilu\\"). The inscription reads \\"A LA GLOIRE DES ENFANTS DE DOL MORTS POUR LA FRANCE\\". In this chapel, there is a mosaic altar dedicated to Notre-Dame de Piti√© executed in 1902 and the work of the sculptor Augerie and the mosaicist Isidore Odorico. = \\"La Chapelle du Crucifix\\" = This chapel holds a carving of Christ on the Cross with the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist. This dates to 1876 and was carved by the Valentin brothers of Rennes. The stained glass depicts Jesus, between his mother and John the Evangelist and in judgement of the dead seen emerging from their tombs. This has a well which feeds water through an underground conduit to a second well (puit) outside the cathedral. Both wells are fed from the same source. = \\"Chapelle des Fonts baptismaux\\" = The baptistry with baptismal font. = Chapter House = What was the Chapterhouse (salle Capitulaire or salle du chapitre) is now the oratory Saint Magloire and dates to the 14th-century. = Bas-relief depicting \\"J√©sus et les docteurs\\" = This small limestone bas-relief dates to the late 19th-century and depicts Jesus in discussion with the lawyers at the temple. (\\"After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions\\". Luke.). = Stations of the Cross = The 14 \\"Stations of the Cross\\" or \\"Chemin de croix\\" in the cathedral were installed there in 1903 and were the 1868 work of the sculptor Jean- Baptiste Germain. They are worked in the repouss√© fashion in copper which was then gilded and silvered. The wooden frames were added in 1970. = Stained glass = The cathedral is one of the few religious buildings in Brittany to retain stained glass windows from the 13th-century, and when restoring windows during the following centuries they used fragments of glass recovered from windows of the 14th, 15th and 16th-century.  La ma√Ætresse-vitre du chevet  The chevet window The main stained glass window of the chevet, which is effectively the window lighting the choir, dates to between 1280 and 1290. The window was restored at the beginning of the 17th-century and was reglazed in 1870 when many of the older frames were saved by the glazier/artist Oudinot. This major restoration was commissioned by Monseigneur l'abb√© Brignon. During the 1944 bombing which preceded Dol-de-Bretagne's liberation from German occupation, explosions badly damaged the window necessitating restoration work by the master glazier Jacques Gruber. A further restoration was carried out between 1982 and 1986. The window is made up of eight lancets above which is an elaborate tympanum and these lancets contain forty-eight frames recounting details from the lives of those saints said to have relics held in the cathedral. These are a belt from Sainte-Marguerite, pieces of the ch√™ne de Mambr√©, remnants of saint Samson and sainte Catherine's teeth. The eight lancets, from the left and from the top to the bottom depict:- # The history of Margaret the Virgin or Margaret of Antioch # The history of Abraham # Scenes from Jesus' childhood # The Passion. # The Passion. # The history of saint Samson # Depicts the first six Archbishops of Dol, surrounded by their suffragan bishops, the bishops of L√©on, Tr√©guier, Quimper, Vannes, Aleth and Saint-Brieuc. The Archbishops are Samson, Magloire, Saint Budoc, Saint Leucher, Saint Thuriau and Saint Gen√©v√©, each wearing a pallium a mitre and with a halo. Each carries the archbishop's cross. # The history of Catherine of Alexandria The tympanum represents the Final judgement. In the quatrefoil to the right of Christ is a depiction of Paradise whilst that to the left depicts Hell with the enormous jaws of a green dragon.

The quadrilobe on the right side of the window's tympanum  The upper windows of the choir and transept  Most of these windows are grisailles from the year 1290 and completed in 1890-1891. The windows in the transept crossings depict four archbishops. These date to 1265 to 1270 and were restored in 1890 by Jacquier and K√ºchelbecker. At a later date, the shields of the bishops Jean de Lizaunet and Jean Mah√© were added to the window in the north crossing and the arms of Thibaud de Pouanc√© and Jean du Bosc to the window on the south crossing.  The tympanums in the choir chapel windows  Some of the choir chapel windows have used fragments of earlier windows in their tympanums. * In the la chapelle de la Vierge windows tympanum there is a depiction of Christ accompanied by the Tetramorph this taken from an earlier window. * In the chapelle Saint-Joseph there is a \\"Christ en gloire\\" with Tetramorph and angels playing musical instruments, this fragment having come from a 1420s window. * In the chapelle du Crucifix there is a fragment from an earlier window which depicts the final judgement  The main windows in the south and north transept  The main window of the north transept of the cath√©drale Saint-Samson de Dol de Bretagne. Depicts scenes from the life of Sainte Anne The main window of the south transept of the cath√©drale Saint- Samson de Dol de Bretagne. Depicts scenes from the life of saint Magloire The \\"Saint Magloire\\" appears in the cathedral's bay 104. It dates to 1884 and depicts scenes from Magloire's life. It was the work of the Le Mans atelier of Jacquier and Maurice K√ºchelbecker. This window replaced an earlier window dating to 1280. In bay 103 is the window dedicated to sainte Anne and this bears the arms of pope L√©on XIII in the left side spandrel and the arms of Dol in the spandrel on the right. Also the work of Jacquier and Maurice K√ºchelbecker this window dates to 1887\\" The Magloire window relates episodes from the life of saint Magloire who succeeded saint Samson on the episcopal throne. It dates to 1884 and was the work of the atelier Jacquier and K√ºchelbecker of Mans. The window's eight lancets each had eight frames. In the lower level, Magloire is shown leaving the world, his being nominated as Samson's successor, his preaching to the people of Dol in front of Mont Dol, abdicating in favour of saint Budoc. In the window's upper level we see Magloire enjoying the solitude of Mont-Dol, curing a rich Breton who gave him half of the island of Sercq where he built a monastery and rescuing a fisherman drowning in the sea. In the tympanum Magloire receives communion surrounded by angels. The same atelier of Jacquier and K√ºchelbecker installed the window depicting scenes from the life of sainte Anne in the north transept. These include the marriage of Anne and Joachim, the high priest rejecting Joachim's sacrifice, the announcement of the birth of the Virgin Mary to Anne and the meeting at the Golden Gate, all in the first frame. In the second frame, the scenes depict the Virgin Mary's birth, the Virgin Mary's education, the Virgin Mary's presentation at the temple and the death of sainte Anne. The tympanum is decorated with two quartilobes and a rosace showing Yves Nicolazic seeing the apparition of sainte Anne, the pilgrimage of Bretons to Sainte-Anne-d'Auray and sainte Anne \\"in glory\\" amidst a group of angels. = Sculpture =  \\"Le Christ aux liens/Le Christ aux Outrages\\"  The wooden sculpture showing Christ after he has been scourged and beaten and sits awaiting crucifixion This 16th-century wooden and polychromed sculpture showing Christ waiting for the crucifixion and showing the signs of the beating and humiliation he has suffered (\\"Christ souffrant\\") is located in the aisle to the north of the nave. It dates to the 16th century. It came from the old manor of Beauvais.  \\"La Vierge-m√®re\\"  Another wooden painted sculpture depicting the Virgin Mary is situated at the entrance to the south nave. Prior to 1792 this sculpture had been part of the rood screen which was pulled down by the revolutionaries.  Lutrin  The cathedral lutrin takes the form of an eagle The lutrin  King Nomino√´  Statue of Nomino√´ outside the Dol-de-Bretagne cathedral This statue stands in the grounds outside the cathedral. Nominoe, Nomino√´ in French or Nevenoe in Breton was the first Duke of Brittany from 846 to 851. He is the Breton pater patriae and to Breton nationalists is known as Tad ar Vro (\\"father of the country\\"). He was succeeded by his son Erispoe. Both are buried at Redon Abbey. Erispoe was assassinated in 857 by his cousin and successor Salomon. Salomon (Breton: Sala√ºn) was Count of Rennes and Nantes from 852 and Duke of Brittany from 857 until his death by assassination in 874. He used the title King of Brittany intermittently after 868. He was canonised as \\"Saint Salomon\\" after his death and raised to the rank of martyr. His death resulted from a conspiracy involving Pascweten, Wrhwant, and Wigo, son of Riwallon, Count of Cornouaille, but they quickly fell out with each other and a civil war followed until 876. Judicael (or Yezekael) (died 888 or 889) was the Duke of Brittany from 876 to his death in 888 or 889 He was a son of a daughter of Erispoe and had claimed Brittany after the death of the pretenders Wrhwant and Pascweten in 876. Judicael reconciled with Alan to fight the Vikings, however. Together, they defeated the raiders at the Battle of Questembert in 888 or 889, but Judicael lost his life in the fighting. After his death Brittany was ruled by Alan I, King of Brittany and then Gourma√´lon. From 907 to 938 Brittany was occupied by the Vikings. There is a much larger memorial to Nomino√´ at Bains-sur-Oust which celebrates the victory of the Bretons over the French. = Sarcophagus = In the cathedral's presbytery garden there is a granite sarcophagus which is thought to have received saint Samson's remains when he died in 565. This was placed in the garden by abb√© Pierre Chevrier a curate at Dol between 1841 and 1866. The sarcophagus has lost its cover. Before removal to the presbytery, the sarcophagus was kept inside the cathedral. When the Normans invaded Brittany in 878 it was decided to move Samson's remains to a safer place but the sarcophagus had been too heavy to transport and was left in Dol. When the relics were returned to Dol they were never put back inside the sarcophagus but kept in another container. = Other stained glass windows = High up in the eastern side of the south transept there is a window dating to around 1265 to 1270 depicting two other Dol bishops, Thibaud de Pouanc√© and Henri Du Bois. 350px Notes =Sources= * Catholic Hierarchy: Diocese of Dol * \\"Cath√©drales et basiliques de Bretagne\\" √âditions Ereme with texts by Yves-Pascal Castel, Chantal Leroy and Dominique de La Rivi√®re.

It is the location of the Tis Hazari Courts Complex which was inaugurated on 19 March 1958 by Chief Justice Mr. A. N. Bhandari of the then Punjab High Court. It is one of the six District Courts that function under the Delhi High Court, and continues to be the principal Court building in state of Delhi. History The place gets its name from a force of 30,000 Sikhs, which encamped here under military general Baghel Singh in 1783, prior to attacking Delhi. Under the command of Baghel Singh Dhaliwal and other leading warriors crossed the Yamuna and captured Saharanpur. They overran the territory of Najib ud-Daulah, the Ruhila chief, acquiring from him a tribute of eleven lakh of rupees (INR 1,100,000). In April Baghel Singh Dhaliwal with two other sardars (Rai Singh Bhangi and Tara Singh Ghaiba) crossed the Yamuna to occupy that country, which was then ruled by Zabita Khan, who was the son and successor of Najib ud-Daulah. Zabita Khan in desperation offered Baghel Singh Dhaliwal large sums of money and proposed an alliance to jointly plunder the crown lands. Sardar Baghel Singh Dhaliwal set up an octroi-post near Sabzi Mandi to collect the tax on the goods imported into the city to finance the search and the construction of the Sikh Temples. (He did not want to use the cash received from the Government Treasury for this purpose, and most of that was handed out to the needy and poor. He often distributed sweetmeats bought out of this government gift to the congregationalists at the place which is now known as the Pul Mithai.) Tis Hazari Court The Tis Hazari Courts Complex was inaugurated in 1958 by Chief Justice A.N. Bhandari, the then Chief Justice of Punjab, since Delhi was under the jurisdiction of High Court of Punjab at the time. Tis Hazari was the principal court complex in Delhi, since Delhi consisted of only one district. However, courts were shifted out to other complexes with time. Presently, the court houses courts having their jurisdiction over Central Delhi, West Delhi. = 2019 Clash of Lawyers & Police = On 2nd November, 2019, an altercation broke out between lawyers and police officers allegedly allegedly over parking. The lawyers alleged that the police misbehaved with them, while the police claimed that the lawyers turned violent without provocation. The incident spiralled into a police officer opening fire at lawyers, injuring two lawyers. The police claim that this was done to prevent lawyers from breaking into the lockup. Following this, spontaneous violence broke out throughout the Tis Hazari complex and several vehicles, including police vehicles, were set ablaze. A lady Deputy Commissioner of Police who happened to be present in the complex claimed to have her pistol snatched by lawyers. The High Court of Delhi took cognizance of the violence, and conducted a special hearing on Sunday. The High Court ordered suspension of the police officers involved, and transfer of a Special Commissioner of Police and an Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police. The High Court also ordered a judicial probe headed by Justice (Retired) S.P. Garg. The lawyers in all district courts of Delhi immediately went on strike and abstained from work. In the following days, incidents of lawyers harassing and manhandling police officers were reported. The strike was called off two weeks later. = Sexual Harassment = Several female lawyers have reported incidents of sexual harassment at Tis Hazari Courts, including groping and sexually coloured remarks. St Stephen's Hospital St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi is the other landmark at Tis Hazari. It is a 600 bedded tertiary care and teaching hospital located adjacent to the court complex. Transport The area is serviced by the Tis Hazari station on the Red Line of the Delhi Metro. Besides the Metro connections, Tis Hazari District Court is well connected through a series of \\"Destination\\" Bus services run by the Delhi Bar Association from Karkardooma Court, Patiala House Court, Delhi High Court and Supreme Court. One can otherwise avail other local buses with the major Bus terminal / destination namely ISBT and the nearby Mori Gate bus stop.

After some analysis the researchers found that the Milicia excelsa was inbreeding due to lack of proximity to other Milicia excelsa individuals. Inbreeding could contribute to why this species is moving closer to being on the ‚ÄúThreatened‚Äù conservation list. If the numbers of mates available are not high enough because dispersion methods are not effective over long distances, then the species will begin to suffer from inbreeding depression (inbreeding can lead to accumulation of recessive deleterious alleles in a population). Trunk of Milicia excelsa (Chlorophora Excelsa) in Lawachara National Park, Bangladesh. 2016. Description The species is a large deciduous tree growing up to high. The trunk is bare lower down with the first branch usually at least above the ground. It often has several short buttress roots at the base. The bark is pale or dark grey, thick but little fissured, and if it gets damaged it oozes milky latex. There are a few thick branches in the crown all fairly horizontal giving an umbrella shape. The smaller branches hang down in female trees and curve up in male trees. The leaves are long, ovate or elliptical with a finely toothed edge, green and smooth above and slightly downy beneath. Older leaves turn yellow, and all of the leaves have a prominent rectangular mesh of veins visible on the underside. The trees are dioecious. Male trees have white catkins that extend and dangle from twigs at the axils of the leaves. Female trees have flower spikes measuring long by wide, green with prominent styles. The fruit are long, wrinkled and fleshy with the small seeds embedded in the pulp. There is evidence that some of the variation that is described above amongst individuals is due to the variation in the environment. In a study done in 2010, it was found that environmental change from different regions in Benin caused much of the variation in Milicia excelsa. Many studies have attributed this variation in growth to the differences in climate of regions. Specifically, soil characteristics and rainfall played a major role in the morphological variation of trunk growth of Milicia excelsa. Milicia excelsa is one of two tree species (the other being Milicia regia) that yield timber commonly known as African teak. Ecology Flowering takes place at a range of different times, but often occurs in January and February soon after the time when most of the leaves fall or shortly before the new leaves appear. The fruits take about a month to ripen and are eaten by squirrels, bats, and birds, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some populations, especially plantations, are attacked by a gall mite. A study in Ghana found that this tree relies heavily on the straw- coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) for seed dispersal, over 98% of the seed falling to the ground having passed through its gut.Taylor, Daniel; Kankam, Bright; Wagner, Michael The role of the fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, in seed dispersal, survival, and germination in Milicia excelsa, a threatened West African hardwood. Northern Arizona University School of Forestry. This seed also germinated better than uneaten seed and resisted predation longer. Evolution In a study 1. Dainou, K., E. Laurenty, G. Mahy, O. J. Hardy, Y. Brostaux, N. Tagg, and J.-L. Doucet. \\"Phenological Patterns in a Natural Population of a Tropical Timber Tree Species, Milicia Excelsa (Moraceae): Evidence of Isolation by Time and Its Interaction with Feeding Strategies of Dispersers.\\" American Journal of Botany (2012): 1453-463. Print. it was seen that isolation was caused by one or more of the animals that are known for dispersal of Milicia excelsa (i.e. Bats, rodents, and birds). It is hypothesized that the ancestor slowly developed a different flowering time from its ancestor, which led to differences in selection pressure during the time of reproduction. This, over time, has resulted in the tree that we see today commonly known as Iroko. Although this is the theory that has the most evidence, it is possible for Milicia excelsa to have evolved in a different way. Uses The tree yields a strong, dense and durable dark brown hardwood timber. It is resistant to termites and is used for construction, furniture, joinery, panelling, floors and boats. The tree can be used in the control of erosion, and for providing shade as a roadside tree in urban areas. It grows rapidly, can be coppiced and is ready for cutting after about fifty years. The tree is nitrogen fixing and the leaves are used for mulching. The tree is also used in herbal medicine. The powdered bark is used for coughs, heart problems and lassitude. The latex is used as an anti-tumour agent and to clear stomach and throat obstructions. The leaves and the ashes also have medicinal uses. Importance to the environment In a study done on the mineralization of Milicia excelsa,Braissant, Olivier, Guillaume Cailleau, Michel Aragno, and Eric P. Verrecchia. \\"Biologically Induced Mineralization in the Tree Milicia Excelsa (Moraceae): Its Causes and Consequences to the Environment.\\" Geobiology: 59-66. Print. it was observed that in certain conditions Milicia acts as a carbon sink. These specific conditions are characterized by presence of oxalate, bacteria for oxalate oxidation and a dry season, which are common conditions in which Milicia tends to grow. This is important because the conversion of atmospheric carbon into land carbon decreases the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of its importance to the environment there has been research done on how to conserve Iroko. A solution that has been proposed to help Milicia excelsa move further away from being threatened is agroforestry. It was found that agroforestry helps increase habitat for plants and animals. More importantly, agroforestry promotes the growth of any plant species by taking pressure off remnant forests that usually have to repopulate threatened species on their own. The people that conducted this study found that it would be a good method to use to specifically fight against the slow decline of the Iroko species. However, most of the people that were surveyed for the study did not use this system specifically to regenerate this species, therefore even though there is hope in helping this species the measures have not been taken to do so. When forests are felled, isolated trees are often left standing and the tree regenerates easily. Fresh seed germinates readily but it loses viability in storage. Conservation Because of these and many other uses of Milicia excelsa people have over harvested this species to the point of concern. The IUCN has this species on the Red List under ‚ÄòNear Threatened‚Äô (BIZOUX, J.-P., 2009).J.-P. Bizoux, K. Dai‚Äônou, N. Bourland, O. J. Hardy, M. Heuertz, G. Mahy, and J.-L.

Fertility and birth are associated with it and its timber is used to make ceremonial drums and coffins.

It is found in Benin, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Senegal. It is threatened by habitat loss and logging. Description Milicia regia has a wide, rounded dark green crown. The trunk is tall and straight, with smooth, reddish-brown bark. The leaves are borne on short petioles and are ovate, dark green and up to long. They are arranged alternately along the twig and have seven to eleven lateral nerves and untoothed margins. Male and female flowers are borne on separate trees. Male trees are taller and more slender than female trees and start flowering first. The catkins are borne in the axils of the leaves. The male tree has long catkins that can extend to in length, and the flowers in the upper part of the crown come out earlier than those further down. The female catkins are produced on the upper parts of the crown and are green and up to in length, with protruding styles. The flowers are wind pollinated and by the time the fruits have ripened in five to six weeks, they have turned yellow. They fall from the tree and the many small seeds are dispersed by the birds, mammals and insects that feed on the fruit. Distribution and habitat Milicia regia grows in a belt that extends from Zanzibar on the east coast of Africa to Gambia on the west coast. It grows in the high forest zone, in savanna woodland, and in valleys and riverside habitats, but it needs well-drained soil. Uses The timber is strong and durable, with logs being up to a metre (yard) in diameter. It is yellow-brown to brown with a coarse texture and darker veins. It is resistant to termites and fungal attack, and damage by wood-boring insects is limited to the sapwood. Milicia regia is one of two trees known as \\"odum\\" in Ghana, the other being the closely related Milicia excelsa. The timber from both trees is known as \\"iroko\\" and is used in construction, joinery, furniture making and the creation of mortars for grinding food. Attempts to grow the tree in plantations have been unsuccessful because the buds are attacked by the psyllid fly Phytolyma lata. The larvae of this insect create galls that weaken the young tree, causing dieback and even death, with seedlings being particularly affected. Natural regeneration of the tree is poor and because large numbers of trees are being felled each year, its future for commercial timber production is in doubt.

The day has a cultural significance in North West England, as the date on which the annual Whit Walks are traditionally held. By convention, the Whit Walks coincide with brass band contests, held in Saddleworth, Oldham, Tameside and other outlying areas of Greater Manchester. Traditionally, children and their supporters from Anglican Sunday Schools 'walked' on Whit Monday, those from RC Sunday Schools on Whit Friday, C. Bevan, The Edited Diaries Winchester, Piccowinch, 2004) and there was an element of competition in general display, dresses and banners. Outside Manchester city centre, other Sunday Schools walked on Whit Sunday and in surrounding towns on other days during (or in the weeks following) Whit Week. This period marked the height of their year's activities for many local brass bands.  History  The Feast of Pentecost, which falls on the seventh Sunday after Easter, is an important feast day in the Christian Church. In the United Kingdom this was followed by a week of festivities called \\"Whitsuntide\\". As the population moved away from the countryside during the Industrial Revolution, the celebrations became less important in many areas, but in the manufacturing towns of North West England they were seen as a welcome break from work in the mills and factories. In an article in the Manchester Times in 1859 the London correspondent wrote: > Whitsuntide is not a great holiday week with us, as with you...indeed, we > have now no amusements appropriate to this season. We used to have fairs but > these degenerated into nuisances and were properly enough suppressed in the > interests of public morality and decency...although a good number of well- > to-do Londoners take advantage of the week for a cheap trip, the mass of the > populace work and toil through the week, which you Lancashire people have so > well and wisely reserved for recreation.  The Manchester Times Manchester traditionally held its annual horse races on Kersal Moor between the Wednesday and Saturday of Whit Week. The local Sunday School Superintendents worried about the gambling and drinking and \\"desiring to keep youth of both sexes from the demoralising recreations of the racecourse, took them to fields in the neighbourhood and held anniversary celebrations, tea parties etc. in the schools.\\" During the nineteenth century Whitsuntide became an accepted holiday week for all, with the mills shutting down and the workers taking canal boat trips and later, with the coming of the railways, cheap rail excursions. =Whit walks= Members of Westwood Moravian Church, Oldham, Lancashire, taking part in a Whit Sunday parade some time in the 1920s The origin of the whit week processions of \\"Sunday school scholars\\" (which are still held to this day) dates back to 19 July 1821 when there was a procession of the children of Manchester to commemorate the coronation of George IV. On that day children of all denominations walked in procession from their schools and assembled at Ardwick Green to sing \\"God Save the King\\". From then on the annual festival flourished and, in the course of time, St Ann's Square became the assembly ground. The numbers continued to grow and this was moved to Albert Square in 1878. Each Whit Friday, local churches or chapels in the region employed bands to lead traditional processions through the streets. Whit Friday was the \\"Scholars' Walk\\", or the Church's Annual Day when the girls would have a new dress and the boys would have new trousers, and neighbours, friends and relatives would give a penny for their new clothes. The church officers, clergy and children carried baskets of flowers or ribbons attached to banners.Carrbrook Whit Friday Band Contest Brass band contests A brass band contest has been held in Stalybridge on Whit Friday since at least 1870. However, on Whit Friday 6 June 1884, two further events in Uppermill and Mossley were held,The First Recorded Contest, Extract from the Stalybridge Reporter, 1884 inadvertently launching an internationally renowned and unique brass band occasion - the Annual Whit Friday Band Contests. The Whit Friday contests are now firmly placed in the brass band calendar and attract thousands of people, whether musicians or spectators, to listen to brass band music.

It grows from a thick trunk with a smooth grey bark that branches at ¬Ω‚Äì1 m (1¬Ω‚Äì3 ft) above the ground. It has silvery, lance-shaped, pointy leaves of 5‚Äì8¬º cm (2.0‚Äì3.3 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì3¬º cm (0.3‚Äì1.3 in) wide, at an upward angle and overlapping each other. The inflorescences are set just below the top of the branches, are cylinder-shaped, 8‚Äì10 cm (3¬º‚Äì4 in) in diameter, topped by a crest of more or less horizontal pinkish or reddish tinged leaves. It consists of several flower heads in the axils of pinkish orange leaves that form a hood shielding the underlying flower head. Each flower head contains eight to thirteen individual flowers, with bright red styles and grey silky perianth lobes. It is endemic to the Fynbos ecoregion of South Africa, being confined to the Kogelberg mountain range.  Description  Mimetes arboreus is a large shrub or small tree of 2‚Äì6 m (6¬Ω‚Äì20 ft) high that grows from a smooth, stout, prominent trunk of 10‚Äì36 cm (‚Öì‚Äì1 ft) wide. Branches occur from ¬Ω‚Äì1 m (1¬Ω‚Äì3 ft) above the ground which fork regularly higher up and so constitute a rounded crown. The trunk and branches are covered in a smooth grey bark with horizontal stripes that develops lower down into a corky layer of about 1 cm (0.4 in) thick, crossed by a network of cracks. The pointy, lance-shaped leaves are set alternately along the branches, at an upward angle and overlapping, and lack both stipules and stalk. They are 5‚Äì8¬º cm (2.0‚Äì3.3 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì3¬º cm (0.3‚Äì1.3 in) wide, silvery due to a dense layer of silky hairs, have an entire margin with a reddish amber-coloured thickened tip, seldomly with three teeth. The inflorescences are set just below the top of the branches, are cylinder-shaped, 8‚Äì10 cm (3¬º‚Äì4 in) in diameter, topped by a crest of more or less horizontal pinkish or reddish tinged leaves. It consists of several flower heads in the axils of pinkish orange leaves at a moderate upward angle that form a hood shielding the underlying flower head. Each flower head contains eight to thirteen individual flowers. The outer whorl of bracts that encircle the flower heads are equal in size, cartilaginous in consistency but becoming woody when dry, oblong to oval in shape, 1‚Äì1¬æ cm (0.4‚Äì0.7 in) long and ¬Ω‚Äì¬æ cm (0.2‚Äì0.3 in) wide, silky hairy and with a row of equal length hairs along its rim. The bracts on the inside of the head are roughly hairy, oblong or narrowly oblong and 1‚Äì2 cm (0.4‚Äì0.8 in) long and 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) wide. The bract subtending the individual flower is line- shaped, about 1¬Ω cm (0.6 in) long and 1‚Äì2 mm (0.04‚Äì0.08 in) wide, and covered in dense rough hairs. The 4-merous perianth is mostly pink, sometimes yellow, straight when in the bud and 3‚Äì4 cm (1.2‚Äì1.6 in) long. The lower part, that remains merged when the flower is open, is about 3 mm (0.12 in) long, hairless, square in cross-section at its base and inflated at the top. The four segments in the middle part (or claws), are line-shaped and (sometimes densely) silky hairy. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are line-shaped in outline, boat- shaped with a pointy tip, silky hairy and about 1 cm (0.4 in). The four anthers lack a filament and are directly connected to the limbs, line- to thread-shaped, with the connecting tissue sticking out in a point at the tip. From the centre of the perianth emerges a straight, hairless, thread-shaped style of 4¬Ω‚Äì5¬Ω cm (2.2‚Äì2.4 in) long. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is line- to thread-shaped with a pointy tip, narrower where it joins with the style, slightly bent with a groove that functions as the stigma across the tip, 7‚Äì8 mm (about ‚Öì in) long. The egg- shaped ovary is densely covered in silky hairs pressed against its surface, and about 2 mm (0.04‚Äì0.08 in) long. This develops into an egg-shaped fruit, eventually about 1 cm long and ¬Ω cm across.  Taxonomy  As far as known, the Kogelberg silver pagoda was first collected by Thomas Pearson Stokoe in 1921 at Hangklip near Pringle Bay. It was described and named Mimetes arboreus in 1982 by John Patrick Rourke.  Distribution and habitat  Mimetes arboreus is an endemic species restricted to the Kogelberg Nature Reserve, from Steenbras Ridge in the North to Pringle Peak near Betty's Bay in the south. It grows on steep slopes near the sea, mostly the cooler southern or southeastern face on altitudes varying between 450 m (1500 ft) and 1200 m (4000 ft). Mimetes arboreus is a slow growing and relatively long lived species. Specimens were observed to start flowering at an age of around fifteen years. The thick bark gives it some protection to fire, and new growth appears at the tip of the highest branches.  Conservation  The Kogelberg pagoda is considered an endangered species due to the limited areas where its populations occupy within a distribution area of and its small (around 1000 plants), fluctuating population. Negative impacts may arise from too high frequency wildfires, Phytophthora, and competition by invasive species.

Description  The thirteen species currently assigned to the genus Mimetes are evergreen, low shrubs to small trees of ¬Ω‚Äì6 m (1‚Öî‚Äì20 ft) high. Its leaves lack stipules, are set alternately along the branches, without a leaf stalk, at an upward angle or more or less overlapping, long inverted egg-shaped, oval or long diamond-shaped, 1¬Ω‚Äì8¬º cm (0.6‚Äì3.2 in) long and ¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (0.2‚Äì1.6 in) wide, with an entire margin, thickened at the tip and often with mostly three teeth clustered close together. After the flower heads in the axils of the leaves have been shed, the dormant growing tip is activated and produces the next inflorescence. It has twelve homologous sets of chromosomes (2n=24). = Inflorescence and flower heads = The flower heads are grouped in cylindric aggregations in the axils of the higher leaves of the stems. The bracts that subtend each flower head are either small and woody, or enlarged, bright in colour, papery or fleshy. The individual flower heads contain three to thirty-five flowers, relatively few compared to many other Proteaceae genera. This, and the sometimes bright coloration of the leaves and bracts in the inflorescence, result in the flower head functioning more or less as a single flower. Three types of flower head are distinguished: brush, tube and gullet. The flower heads of most species are of the brush-type. Flower heads of the brush-type have large perianths, pollen presenters and often bracts in bright and contrasting yellow, white or red. The subtending leaves do not differ from other leaves and remain green throughout flowering. In the tube-type flower heads, that only occurs in M. pauciflora, the number of flowers per head is reduced down to three (rarely four), and the involucral bracts are short. The bright yellow bracteoles of the three flowers together form a long, straight an narrow tube, from which only the perianth limbs and pollen presenters extend. The tube-type flower head functions comparable to tube-shaped corollas, such as in the large-flowered Erica species. The gullet-type flower head uniquely occurs in M. cucullatus and M. fimbriifolius. It functions in the same way as Acanthus and many Scrophulariaceae and Lamiaceae flowers. The bracts at the side of the stem are smaller, those in sight from the side are enlarged, while the leaf that is subtending the flower head aboved forms a brightly coloured hood. When the flowers open, the styles grow longer, break free from the perianth, and are pressed in the overhead leaf. = Flower = The individual flowers are 4-merous, star-symmetrical, and contain both male and female organs. The perianth is cylinder-shaped in the bud. The lower part, where the lobes remain merged when the flower has opened (called tube), is mostly becoming hairless, very short, circular to somewhat square in cross section or inflated. In the middle part (or claws) where the perianth is split lengthwise, the lobes are thread-shaped and softly hairy. In the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, the four lobes are line-shaped, pointy or pointed, continue to be softly hairy or becoming hairless. The anthers are line-shaped with a pointy tip, directly merged with the base of the limbs without a filament. From the perianth emerges a style that is circular in cross section, curved when breaking open the bud, but eventually straight. The slightly thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is line-shaped, with a pointy of pointed tip, cylinder-shaped, egg-shaped or head-shaped, with a ring distinguishing its base from the style. The ovary is slender, softly hairy and contains one pendulous ovule, it is difficult to determine where it merges into the style. It is subtended by four blunt or line- to thread-shaped scales.  Taxonomy  In 1807, Richard Anthony Salisbury in his contribution to William Hooker's book The Paradisus Londinensis, divided Leucadendron, as defined by Carl Linnaeus and that contained rather divers forms, over several new genera and erected, amongst others, the genus Mimetes. Two years later Salisbury assigned five species to Mimetes in a book by Joseph Knight titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, M. fimbriifolius, M. splendidus, M. argenteus, M. hirtus and M. palustris. In 1810, Robert Brown in his review called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae newly described M. pauciflorus, M. capitulatus, and reassigned Leucadendron cucullatum, creating the new combination M. cucullatus. But he also collapsed Salisbury's genus Diastella into Mimetes. Carl Meissner, who contributed a section on the Proteaceae in 1856 to the series Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis by Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, integrated both Diastella and Orothamnus as the sections Pseudomimetes and Orothamnus, and assigning Mimetes as defined by Salisbury to the section Eumimetes. In 1911, Edwin Percy Phillips described M. saxatilis. Phillips and John Hutchinson disagreed with Brown and Meissner, and in 1912 returned to Salisbury's delimitation, restoring both Diastella and Orothamnus. Phillips described M. stokoei in 1922 and M. hottentoticus in 1923. In 1982 John Patrick Rourke described M. arboreus, and finally in 1988 M. chrysanthus. = Phylogeny = Comparison of homologous DNA has increased the insight in the phylogenetic relationships between the Proteaceae. It shows that Mimetes belongs to a group that further only consists of genera endemic to the Cape Floristic Region, that together constitute the subtribe Leucadendrinae. There is doubt whether Mimetes is monophyletic, since a study that looked at few genes, and included five of the species of Mimetes, two of Diastella and Orothamnus zeyheri, indicates that some Mimetes species may be more related to these two genera than to other Mimetes species. Leucospermum is most related to the Mimetes-group. A subgroup of Paranomus, Vexatorella, Sorocephalus and Spatalla is the sister group to the Leucospermum-Mimetes subgroup. The following trees together represent those insights. = Naming = The genus name Mimetes (ŒúŒπŒºŒ∑œÑŒ≠œÇ) is Ancient Greek and means \\"imitators\\", because its leaves are similar to those of several other genera. The word is masculine in Greek and Salisbury conjugated the species names accordingly. Robert Brown, and Phillips and Hutchinson made feminine epithets. Rourke in 1984 agreed with Salisbury. The species are called pagoda for their tiered compound inflorescences in English, and stompie (small stump) probably for the charcoaled remains sticking out of the ground after a fire in Afrikaans. = Species = The following species names are currently recognised: * Mimetes arboreus Rourke or Kogelberg pagoda * Mimetes argenteus Salisb. ex Knight or silver pagoda * Mimetes capitulatus R.Br. or conical pagoda * Mimetes chrysanthus Rourke or golden pagoda * Mimetes cucullatus (L.) R.Br. or common pagoda * Mimetes fimbriifolius Salisb. ex Knight or fringed pagoda * Mimetes hirtus Salisb. ex Knight or marsh pagoda * Mimetes hottentoticus E.Phillips & Hutch. or matchstick pagoda * Mimetes palustris Salisb. ex Knight or cryptic pagoda * Mimetes pauciflorus R.Br. or three-flowered pagoda * Mimetes saxatilis E.Phillips or limestone pagoda * Mimetes splendidus Salisb. ex Knight or splended pagoda * Mimetes stokoei E.Phillips or mace pagoda File:Mimetes arboreus Nick Helme 2.jpgMimetes arboreus File:Mimetes argenteus Helme 3.jpgMimetes argenteus File:Mimetes capitulatus Rebelo 3.jpgMimetes capitulatus File:Mimetes chrysanthus 1DS-II 3735.jpgMimetes chrysanthus File:Mimetes cucullatus Kleinmond 01.jpgMimetes cucullatus File:Mimetes fimbriifolius 1DS-II 2-4182.jpgMimetes fimbriifolius File:Mimetes hirtus 1DS-II 1-8151.jpgMimetes hirtus File:Mimetes hottentoticus 1DS-II 1-C4933.jpgMimetes hottentoticus File:Mimetes palustris Nigel Forshaw.jpgMimetes palustris File:Mimetes pauciflorus vBerkel 1.jpgMimetes pauciflorus File:Mimetes saxatilis Rebelo 5.jpgMimetes saxatilis File:Mimetes splendidus 1DS-II 1-8144.jpgMimetes splendidus File:Mimetes stokoei Rebelo 2.jpgMimetes stokoei = Hybrids = Hybrids are known between M. cucullatus and M. fimbriifolius from the Cape Peninsula on locations where both parents grow side by side. Intermediate in most characters, the general habitat is mostly like that of M. cucullatus, but the lowest part of the stems is stout, and the bark is thick and cartilaginous like that of M. fimbriifolius. A hybrid of M. capitulatus and M. hirtus was collected ones, and specimens made from cuttings have since been grown at Kirstenbosch. = Reassigned species = The name Mimetes purpureus is a synonym of Diastella proteoides. = Unassigned names = The herbarium specimen collected by Francis Masson, which was described by Salisbury in 1809 and named Mimetes floccosa, could not be traced, and its description is so general that it could apply to several other species. So the identity of this name cannot be established.  Distribution  The genus Mimetes has a distribution not unlike other endemic genera in the Cape Floristic Region, with the highest species concentration in the wet mountains in the southwest, centered around the Kogelberg Nature Reserve. The genus can be found from near Porterville in the north and the Cape Peninsula in the southwest, to Formosa Peak in the east. There are three isolated inland populations of M. cucullatus in the Kouga Mountains, Klein Swartberg and Rooiberg, an isolated mountain in the middle of the Little Karoo. This makes it likely that its distribution used to be larger than today but, with increasing drought, it became limited to areas that are wet enough today. Its close relative M. fimbriifolius is restricted to the surroundings of Table Mountain and the Cape Peninsula. M. saxatilis occurs in an approximately 100 km (63 mi) long, narrow strip along the south coast between Franskraal in the west and Struisbay, several km east of Cape Agulhas, and from there in a narrow strip inland to around Bredasdorp. Mimetes splendidus is a rare species that nevertheless has a relatively large distribution, in the coastal mountains that parallel the south coast between the Clock Peaks near Swellendam in the west and Rondebos near Storms River in the east. M. argenteus can be found between Sir Lowry's Pass near Gordon's Bay through the southeastern slopes of the Hottentots Holland Mountains, along the south face of the Riviersonderend Mountains eastwards to Appelskraal. Its close relative, M. arboreus occupies a rather restricted area in and around the Kogelberg Nature Reserve, from the Steenbras Ridge and the slopes of the Kogelberg south to the mountains above Betty's Bay. M. hottentoticus has an even more restricted distribution, but also in the Kogelberg area, on the higher southeastern face of the Kogelberg Peak and in the northwestern part of the Groenland mountains. M. stokoei is known from the Kogelberg Nature Reserve, somewhat more easterly, on the Paardeberg adjacent to the Palmiet River near Kleinmond. M. hirtus occurs on the Cape Peninsula, in lower southern slopes of the Kogelberg Nature Reserve above Pringle Bay, Betty's Bay, Kleinmond, along the mouth of the Bot River and above Hermanus, with an easterly outlyer in the hills surrounding Elim. Populations west of False Bay between Silvermine and Rondebosch have disappeared. M. pauciflorus is present on the south facing slopes of the coastal mountains along the south coast, between the Ruitersberg, north of Mossel Bay in the Western Cape to slightly beyond Formosa Peak in the Eastern Cape. M. capitulatus is a rare species that occurs in and around the Kogelberg Nature Reserve, particularly on the Paardeberg, the Groenlandberg and the Kogelberg Peak, whereas earlier sightings from the Kleinrivier Mountains could not be confirmed more recently.  Ecology  Mimetes species are pollinated by birds, most frequently the orange-breasted sunbird, Nectarinia violacea, but also malachite sunbird, Nectarinia famosa, and lesser double-collared sunbird, Nectarinia chalybea. Fruits are usually released in the late afternoon, precisely the time of day when ants are most active. This has great survival value because fresh elaiosomes are more attractive to ants.  Conservation  Of the thirteen species, the survival of one, M. cucullatus, is considered to be of least concern. One, M. fimbriifolius, is a rare species. Three species are regarded as vulnerable: M. chrysanthus, M. hirtus and M. pauciflorus. Five species have been categorised as endangered species: M. arboreus, M. argenteus, M. capitulatus, M. saxatilis and M. splendens. Finally, three species are thought to be critically endangered: M. hottentoticus, M. palustris and M. stokoei. M. stokoei was initially known from two locations close to one another with each up to a dozen or so plants. It was thought to have gone extinct as careful searches between 1950 and 1966 did not succeed, when one young plant was found. This plant however died without having flowered in that same year. Again, it could not be traced between 1967 and 2001, but again it was rediscovered, after seeds in the ground germinated following a fire and subsequent rains. cited on References Proteaceae genera Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Mimetes"},{"id":"12899445","text":"Kevin Patrick Pasley (born July 22, 1953 in The Bronx, New York) is a retired professional baseball player whose career spanned 12 seasons. For parts of four seasons, Pasley, a catcher, played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Los Angeles Dodgers (1974, 1976‚Äì77), and the Seattle Mariners (1977‚Äì78). Over his career in the majors, he compiled a .254 batting average with eight runs scored, 31 hits, seven doubles, one home run, and nine runs batted in (RBIs). Pasley hit his only career major league home run in what would prove to be his final at-bat in the majors on October 1, 1978. Pasley was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers out of Chaminade High School during the 1971 Major League Baseball draft. He went on to make his professional debut that season in the Dodgers minor league organization with the Class A-Short Season Medford Dodgers. Pasley would spend the majority of his career in the minor leagues, playing with the Class-A Daytona Beach Dodgers (1972), Double-A Waterbury Dodgers (1973), the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes (1974‚Äì77), the Triple-A San Jose Missions (1978), the Triple-A Portland Beavers (1979), the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs (1980‚Äì81), the Double-A Knoxville Blue Jays (1981), the Triple-A Evansville Triplets (1982), and the Double-A Birmingham Barons (1982). Early life Pasley was born on July 22, 1953, in The Bronx, New York. He attended Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York. During the 1971 Major League Baseball draft, Pasley was selected in the 29 round by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Professional career =Los Angeles Dodgers= After being drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1971, Pasley made his professional baseball debut that season with the Medford Dodgers, Los Angeles' Class A-Short Season minor league baseball affiliate. With Medford, Pasley batted .280 with 23 runs scored, and five doubles in 24 games played. Defensively, Pasley was used as a catcher. For his second season, Pasley was assigned to the Class-A Daytona Beach Dodgers where he was to assume the role as full-time catcher, and Jos√© B√°ez was slated to be his back-up. In late-July, Pasley was hit in the back with a baseball bat, which caused him to miss some playing time. With Daytona Beach that season, he batted .275 with 129 hits, 11 doubles, one and triple in 126 games played. Pasley wore number four when he was a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers later retired the number in honor of Duke Snider. In 1973, Pasley joined the Double-A Waterbury Dodgers of the Eastern League. As a member of the Waterbury club, he batted .260 with 99 hits, 17 doubles, two triples, and one home run in 115 games played. Pasley was scheduled to be a September call-up for the Los Angeles Dodgers that season, but he never appeared in a game. Pasley was re-signed by Los Angeles after the season. He was assigned to the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes of the Pacific Coast League at the start of the 1974 season. With the Dukes, he batted .314 with 50 runs scored, 115 hits, 12 doubles, two triples, two home runs, and 48 runs batted in (RBIs) in 105 games played. Pasley made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut that season after being called up by Los Angeles late into the season. He made his debut on October 2, 1974, against the Houston Astros. In that game, he did not make a plate appearance. Defensively, he played two innings at the catcher position and make one putout and committed no errors. Pasley re-signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers before the start of the 1975 season. He spent the entire season at the Triple-A level with the Albuquerque Dukes. In 98 games with Albuquerque, he batted .249 with 37 runs scored, 84 hits, seven doubles, two home runs, and 34 RBIs in 98 games played. All of his games on defense were spent at the catcher position. At the start of the 1976 season, Pasley was assigned to the Albuquerque Dukes. In 122 games that season with the Dodgers' Triple-A affiliate, he batted .321 with 68 runs scored, 148 hits, 24 doubles, nine triples, two home runs, 60 RBIs, and eight stolen bases. He played 107 at the catcher spot, and six games in the outfield. In September, Pasley was called up to the major leagues by the Dodgers. He made his season debut on September 7, against the San Diego Padres. In that game, he was walked once and did not get a hit in one at-bat. His first hit came on September 9, against the San Francisco Giants. On the season with the Dodgers, he batted .231 with four runs scored, 12 hits, two doubles, and two RBIs in 23 games played. In the field, Pasley committed three errors and made 86 putouts in 23 games as a catcher. On February 1, 1977, the Los Angeles Dodgers re-signed Pasley. At the start of the 1977 season, Baseball Digest named Pasley as a rookie to \\"watch\\". He started the 1977 season at the Triple-A level with the Albuquerque Dukes. With the Dukes, he batted .304 with 41 runs scored, 112 hits, 18 doubles, one triple, one home run, and 60 RBIs in 69 games played. In August, he was called up to Los Angeles and made his season debut on August 6, against the Philadelphia Phillies, getting one hit in three at-bats. In one other game with the Dodgers that year, Pasley did not make a plate appearance. On August 17, he was optioned to the minor leagues. =Seattle Mariners= In September 1977, the Seattle Mariners purchased Pasley from the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made his debut with the Mariners on September 11, against the Texas Rangers, getting one hit in four at-bats during that game. In four games with the Mariners that season, he batted .385 with five hits in 13 at-bats. Combined between the Dodgers and the Mariners that year, Pasley had six hits in 16 at-bats, putting his average at .375. In January 1978, the Daily Record cited the Mariners' catching, and Pasley specifically, as strong points for Seattle going into the 1978 season. Pasley made Seattle's roster out of spring training in 1978. From May 9 to April 2, Pasley batted .115 in 26 at-bats. On May 8, he was sent down to the minor leagues. In the minors, Pasley played with the Mariners Triple-A affiliate, the San Jose Missions. With the team, he batted .261 with 32 runs scored, 94 hits, 19 doubles, one triple, three home runs, and 43 RBIs in 98 games played. He was called up to the majors in late-August. On October 1, Pasley hit his first career major league home run during his final at-bat of the game and of the season. That at-bat would later prove to be his final in the majors. On March 28, 1979, the Mariners released Pasley. =Later career= In mid-July 1979, Pasley joined the Portland Beavers, who were the Triple-A affiliates of the Pittsburgh Pirates at the time. With the Beavers that year, he batted .278 with seven runs scored, 15 hits, two doubles, and five RBIs in 20 games played. Defensively, he played 18 games at the catcher spot. Pasley joined the Toronto Blue Jays organization in 1980. The team assigned him to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. With the Chiefs that year, he batted .248 with 16 runs scored, 75 hits, seven doubles, three triples, two home runs, and 35 RBIs in 86 games played. In the field, Pasley played 80 games behind the plate. Pasley split the 1981 season between the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs and the Double-A Knoxville Blue Jays, who were both affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays at the time. In 86 games at the Double-A level, he batted .281 with 31 runs scored, 85 hits, 13 doubles, one triple, four home runs, and 33 RBIs. With Knoxville, he played 38 games at the catcher position, 26 games at first base, and one game in the outfield. In just 10 games with the Chiefs, Pasley compiled a .375 batting average with five runs scored, 12 hits, and two doubles. Between the two clubs, his batting average was .290. On March 10, 1982, Pasley signed with the Detroit Tigers. The Tigers subsequently assigned him to their minor league organization. He split the year between the Triple-A Evansville Triplets, and the Double-A Birmingham Barons. At the Triple-A level, he batted .273 with three hits in 11 at-bats. With the Barons, he batted .257 with five runs scored, 19 hits, and two doubles in 20 games played. Between the two teams, his average was .259. That season would mark his final in professional baseball.

It has green, slightly stalked oval leaves of 3‚Äì4¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.8 in) long and 1‚Äì1¬æ cm (0.4‚Äì0.7 in) wide. The inflorescences are near the tip of the branches, cylinder-shaped and consist of 50‚Äì70 densely cropped flower heads, each in the axil of a green leaf, consisting of 25‚Äì35 golden yellow, faintly sweet scented flowers. It is endemic to the Fynbos ecoregion of South Africa and is found in two locations, in the Western Cape province. The flowering season is from March to May or June, but flower heads sometimes occur in any other part of the year.  Description  Mimetes chrysanthus is an evergreen, upright, sparingly branching shrub of 1¬Ω‚Äì2 m (5‚Äì6¬Ω ft) high, with a single main trunk of 4‚Äì6 cm (1‚Öî‚Äì2‚Öì in) thick at its base. From this trunk develop stiff, upright branches of about 2 cm (¬æ in) thick, covered by smooth grey bark. The flowering branches are 4‚Äì7 mm (0.16‚Äì0.28 in) thich and are covered with a dense layer of minute, powdery crisped hairs. The leaves are set alternately along the branches, lack stipules but are narrowed at their base to a stalk of 3‚Äì5 mm (0.12‚Äì0.20 in) long. The blade is broadly lance-shape to elliptic, 3‚Äì4¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.8 in) long and 1‚Äì1¬æ cm (0.4‚Äì0.7 in) wide, initially with some minute, powdery crisped hairs, that will wear off with time. The margin is entire and the thickening at the tip is notched or even slightly split in two. The inflorescence consists of fifty to seventy crowded flower heads, each in the axil of a leaf, that together constitute a cylinder shape of 6‚Äì9 cm (2.4‚Äì3.6 in) long, 5¬Ω‚Äì6 cm (2.2‚Äì2.4 in) wide, that is topped by a crest of more or less upright, smallish green leaves. Each flower head sits in the axil of an plain green leaf standing out horizontally. Each flower head contains as many as 25‚Äì35 individual flowers, while those lower down usually contain the fewest flowers. The bracts that encircle the flower heads are tightly overlapping. The bracts in the outer whorl are oval with a blunt tip, later slightly spade-shaped, 5‚Äì10 mm (0.2‚Äì0.4 in) long and 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) wide, covered in dense woolly hairs at the base, rounded, thickened, and eventually hairless at the tip. The bracts in the inner whorl are 6‚Äì8 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öì in) long and 1‚Äì1¬Ω mm (0.04‚Äì0.06 in) wide, lance-shaped with a pointy tip, covered in dense silky hairs, cartilaginous in consistency but growing three to four times as large an becoming woody after fertilisation. The bract subtending the individual flower is line-shaped with a pointy tip, ¬æ‚Äì1¬º cm long, silky hairy and with a tuft of longer straight hairs at the tip. The 4-merous perianth is bright yellow, 2¬Ω‚Äì2¬æ mm (1.0‚Äì1.1 in) long, straight when still in bud, curving towards the stem when the flower opens but star- symmetrical thereafter. Unlike other Mimetes species, the flower lacks a tube at its base. The segments in the lower part are ¬æ‚Äì1 cm (0.3‚Äì0.4 in) long, hyaline in consistency, hairless, free and bent to the outside. The middle part forms a tube, because the segments are merged through interlocking hairs along the margins, of 6‚Äì8 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öì in) long and is covered in dense powdery hairs. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are hairless, line-shaped with a pointy tip and 3‚Äì5 mm (0.12‚Äì0.20 in) long. From the centre of the perianth emerges a straight, yellow, thread-shaped style of 2¬Ω‚Äì3¬Ω cm (1.0‚Äì1.4 in) long. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is 1‚Äì1¬º mm long (0.04‚Äì0.06 in), line-shaped, with a slight waist where it joins with the style, while the groove that functions as the stigma sits symmetrical across the very tip. The cylindrical ovary is difficult to distinguish from the style, 2 mm (0.08 in) long and covered in powdery hairs. It is subtended by four awl-shaped scales of 1‚Äì1¬Ω mm (0.04‚Äì0.06 in) long. The ovary develops into an egg-shaped to cylindrical indehiscent, one-seeded fruit of 6‚Äì8 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öì in) long and 4‚Äì5 mm (0.16‚Äì0.20 in) wide, covered in minute powdery hairs and eventually hairless. The flowers of Mimetes chrysanthus are sweetly scented. = Differences with related species = The golden pagoda differs from all other Mimetes species in the large number of flowers per head (25‚Äì35), compared to 14‚Äì22 flowers per head in M. saxatilis, and considerably less in all other species. Further, all other pagodas have a tube at the base of the perianth, where in M. chrysanthus, the segments are free and bending out at the base but connate midlength, and free and diverging near the tip.  Taxonomy  Unexpectedly, the new and very conspicuous golden pagoda was discovered in 1987 by one of the gamekeepers at the Gamka Mountain Nature Reserve, Mr. Willie Julies. It was described by John Patrick Rourke in 1988, who called it Mimetes chrysanthus. The species is variably known as golden pagoda or golden mimetes in English and gouestompie [golden stump] in Afrikaans. The species name chrysanthus has been compounded from the Ancient Greek words œáœÅ·ø°œÉœåœÇ (khr≈´s√≥s) meaning \\"gold\\" and Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (√°nthos) meaning \\"flower\\", in combination \\"golden flower\\", a reference to the luminous golden-yellow flowers.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The golden pagoda is known from two locations. The first, where the species was discovered is on the Gamkaberg, situated on the edge of the Little Karoo, the other on the Perdeberg near Herold. In Gamka it grows on steep, well-drained and nutrient-poor sandy slopes that face the summer winds that bring some rain and mist, though most precipitation fall during the winter, averaging 400‚Äì450 mm (15‚Äì18 in). Here it can be found at an altitude of 800‚Äì1040 m (2625‚Äì3415 ft) in several Sandstone Fynbos types, in particular the Outiniqua Sandstone Fynbos, the South, and the North Rooiberg Sandstone Fynbos. The flowers are visited both by carpenter bees such as Xylocopa capensis, orange-breasted sunbirds and Cape sugarbirds, and produce copious amounts of nectar. Perhaps the bees are mostly responsible for pollination, considering the flowers are yellow, the colour that is most attractive to bees, while birds prefer red. The fruits, that are protected by the enlarged, woody bracts, take about eight months to mature and fall to the ground around December. Here, they are collected by ants that carry them to their underground nests.  Conservation  The golden pagoda is considered a vulnerable species because although it is known from only two locations, its populations are stable. A possible threat would be too frequent wildfires.

The tree is very large and tall making it very noticeable in the horizon. It is also an ever- green tree which means it has green leaves all year round. It produces a very sweet fruit which is green initially and characterized by its reddish color when ripe. It also resembles dates and is described as such to those who don't know of it. It can grow up to 30m and has a shade of 20m+. The Dervish leader Sayyid Mohammed Abdulle Hassan impressed with the majestic tree said, a 100 man cavalry can rest in its shade.

The University Law College (ULC) is the only constituent college of law directly administered by the Bangalore University. Prof. Dr. V. Sudesh is the Principal for University Law College (wef 21-06-2016) and Dean for Faculty of law. He is also serving as the Chairman for the P.G. Department of Studies and Research in law. ULC hosts a few well-qualified and experienced faculty and a resourceful administrative staff.http://www.bub.ernet.in/Sub/faculty/Law/Sub/faculty.html The visiting guest-lecturers and professors, mostly legal practitioners, lend flexibility and expertise to the academic staff of ULC. In the era of privatization and commercialization of education in India, ULC continues to uphold the philanthropic tradition in Indian education by dispensing affordable legal education and reaching out to every strata of the society. With a fee structure that amounts to a fraction of the fee charged by most private legal institutions in India, ULC continues to provide its students with the platform to equip themselves with knowledge they can apply to influence legal and social causes. =Campus= From the early days of its inception, ULC was situated in the Central College Campus of Bangalore University, close to the legislative and highest judicial seat of the State. However, at the beginning of the academic year 2006-07, ULC shifted from the heritage campus to a new spacious building situated in the sprawling Jnana Bharathi Campus of Bangalore University, which is located on of land close to the Kengeri suburb of Bangalore. This state-of-the-art new facility hosts eight class rooms where formal teaching sessions are conducted for both B.A., LL.B. and LL.M. programmes, two seminar halls, an independent library and an administrative block with chambers for the Principal, the Chairman & Dean, and all teaching faculty members. The Bangalore University canteen and other shared facilities are located close by. This new eco-friendly campus is also equipped with rain water harvesting system. In addition to these facilities, though ULC is a non- residential law college, separate hostel facilities are available for male and female students within the Jnana Bharathi campus of Bangalore University. History = Early history= The erstwhile Government of Mysore (now the State of Karnataka) started the college in the year 1948. It was previously known as the Bangalore Government Law College. Prof. Narayan Rao was the first Principal of the college. From 1964, ULC was brought under the Faculty of Law of Bangalore University. ULC started with a two-year course, and later offered a three-year postgraduate LL.B. program till 1986. =Pioneering the 5-year integrated B.A.L., LL.B. program= In 1982, V.B. Coutinho became the principal of ULC. During his term, the college emphatically transformed into one of the first professional law colleges in the country by introducing the five-year integrated B.A.L., LL.B. program for the first time, in the academic year 1986‚Äì87. This was an initiative to achieve higher standards in legal education. A few years thereafter, the Committee on Subordinate Legislation of the 10th Lok Sabha, the Committee of Judges on Legal Education appointed by the Chief Justice of India in 1993, and the All India Law Ministers Conference in 1994 unanimously recommended the adoption of the five year LL.B. program as the course for professional legal education.Law Commission of India, Working Paper on the Review of Advocates Act 1961, Pp.18-19 The ULC experience = Academia= At present, ULC offers: * the five-year integrated Bachelor of Laws (B.A. LL.B.)(Hons) program, a semester program with 60 students admitted each year; and * the one-year specialized Master of Laws (LL.M.) program in 5 different branches, with an intake of 12 students per branch (Criminal Law - Business Law - Constitution and Legal Order - Labour, Capital & Law - Environmental Law) =Wholesome education= A challenging curriculum and a diverse student population at ULC prepare the students for success in law practice, litigation, business, public service, and teaching. The experience and exposure to various facets of academic and clinical legal training at ULC is unparalleled. Recognizing the necessity of experiential learning, ULC has developed a state‚Äìof‚Äìthe art clinical program offering students an opportunity to be associated with the legal profession through seminars/workshops,http://www.bub.ernet.in/Sub/faculty/Law/Sub/academic.html internships, mandatory trial-court visits, legal-aid programs, research & projects,http://www.bub.ernet.in/Sub/faculty/Law/Sub/research.html model parliament and moot court activities. Legal education at ULC equips the students for the complete spectrum of career opportunities available to lawyers, and provides them with the capability to adapt to the rapid pace of change that characterizes modern legal practice. As a testimony to this fact, among ULCs graduates are many Supreme Court and High Court Justices, renowned public servants, bureaucrats, lawyers and academicians of repute. Student activities Outside the classroom, there are a rich variety of student interest groups which allow students to pursue every possible interest. The student initiative at ULC is its greatest strength and a spirit of collaboration reigns throughout a student's stay at ULC. Although originally students from urban and rural parts of Karnataka looked at ULC to pursue the study of law, today students come from every region of the country and several foreign countries as well. =NSS= The National Service Scheme is an Indian government-sponsored programme under the Department of Youth Affairs and Sports of the Government of India.http://nss.nic.in/ ULC established a NSS unit in 2008, with about a hundred student-volunteers. The NSS unit at ULC has been actively involved in many social service activities in rural areas and has organized blood donation camps. NSS volunteers have also contributed towards the eco-friendly theme of the new campus by enriching the greenery in the campus with many plants. Sathish Gowda N. Assistant Professor, who actively serving as NSS Programme Officer since 2008. =All India Moot Court Competition= The annual national level moot court competition hosted by ULC is the flagship activity of the student body, the Society of Mooters. The competition attracts participants from law colleges all across the country. The justices of the High Court of KarnatakaHigh Court of Karnataka preside over the finals of the moot court competition. The twenty fourth edition of the All India Moot Court Competition of ULC will be held in February 2020.http://www.ulcbangalore.com =Sports activities= ULC regularly organizes annual sports day and other sporting events such as intra-collegiate football, basketball and cricket tournaments for both boys and girls. =Cultural and literary festivals= ULC also hosts an annual inter- collegiate literary and cultural festival, in addition to a host of intra- college cultural activities. Having successfully organized such festivals in the past under different names, ULC continues this tradition with its law festival called Jus Celebre.

She was launched on 29 March 1992 and commissioned on 2 April 1993. Homeported at Odessa since March 2014, she is the flagship of the Ukrainian Navy. Service history Built at the Zalyv Shipbuilding yard, the ship was intended to be used by the Soviet Border Troops as Kirov. However, on 4 July 1993, the newly named (after Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny) Hetman Sahaydachniy raised the flag of the Ukrainian Navy. She was given the identification number of U130. In 1994, Hetman Sahaydachniy set sail for France to take part in the 50th anniversary commemorations of the Allied invasion of Normandy. Hetman Sahaydachniy with Turkish frigates In 1995, Hetman Sahaydachniy visited Abu Dhabi during the \\"Idex-95\\" exhibitions. The frigate was scheduled to visit Norfolk, Virginia in the United States with Kostiantyn Olshansky. Olshansky visited but for unknown reasons the Sahaydachniy did not. The vessel has also visited ports in Algeria, Bulgaria, Egypt, Georgia, Gibraltar, Israel, Portugal, Russia and Turkey. Between November 2006 and November 2007, she underwent major repairs in Mykolaiv at a cost of 15 million hryvnia. In 2008, Hetman Sahaydachniy took part in \\"Operation Active Endeavour\\" in the Mediterranean Sea. In February 2013, it was announced that she would be taking part in NATO's \\"Operation Ocean Shield\\", an anti-piracy campaign off the Horn of Africa. Hetman Sahaydachniy joined the Naval Force of the European Union (EUNAVFOR) in early January 2014 for anti-piracy operations. As she refueled in Greece, while Russian forces seized control of Crimea, Russian Senator Igor Morozov claimed on 1 March 2014 that the ship's crew had defected to Russia and raised the Russian flag. Shortly afterwards, independent news organizations reported that the ship was still flying the Ukrainian flag in port in Crete. The commander of the ship confirmed that the crew had never defected to the Russians. She arrived in Odessa under the Ukrainian flag on 5 March. The Ukrainian naval command reported that on 14 March, the ship encountered a Russian naval group in Ukrainian territorial waters. As Hetman Sahaydachniy approached the group, they withdrew into international waters. In September, the frigate entered Odessa to undergo repairs. In May 2017 she suffered an engine failure shortly after undergoing repairs. In July 2018 she participated in the Sea Breeze 2018 multinational exercises. On 2 April 2018 she celebrated the 25th anniversary of her commissioning.

The pronunciation of a consonant as is sometimes called aspiration but in phonetics, aspiration is the burst of air accompanying a stop. The word comes from Latin , meaning \\"cheek\\" or \\"mouth\\". Debuccalization is usually seen as a sub-type of lenition, often defined as a sound change involving the weakening of a consonant by progressive shifts in pronunciation. As with other forms of lenition, debuccalization may be synchronic or diachronic (i.e., it may involve alternations within a language depending on context or sound changes across time). Debuccalization processes occur in many different types of environments such as the following: * word- initially, as in Kannada * word-finally, as in Burmese * intervocalically, as in a number of English varieties (e.g. litter ), or in Tuscan (the house /la kasa/ ‚Üí [la ÀàhaÀêsa]) Glottal stop =Arabic= is debuccalized to in several Arabic varieties, such as northern Egyptian, Lebanese, western Syrian, and urban Palestinian dialects, partially also in Jordanian Arabic (especially by female speakers). The Maltese language, which was originally an Arabic dialect, also shows this feature. =British and American English= Most English-speakers in England and many speakers of American English debuccalize to a glottal stop in two environments: in word-final position before another consonant (American English IPA) *get ready *not much *not good *it says and before a syllabic following , , , or a vowel. Here the may also be nasally released. (American English IPA) *Milton *Martin *mountain *cotton *Latin =Cockney English= In Cockney English, is often realized as a glottal stop between vowels, liquids and nasals (notably in the word bottle), a process called t-glottalization. =German= In German, voiceless stops are commonly debuccalized before syllabic nasals in the following clusters: , which thus become . For example, (‚Äúrags, tatters‚Äù) is pronounced . In some dialects, debuccalization may also occur before syllabic , though this is less common. Voiced stops are not usually debuccalized. However, many Upper German and East Central German dialects merge voiced and unvoiced stops at least word- internally and these merged consonants will be debuccalized. Thus in Bavarian, (‚Äúducks‚Äù) and (‚ÄúAndes‚Äù) are both pronounced . Speakers are often unaware of this. Glottal fricative =Slavey= All coda consonants in Slavey must be glottal. When a non-glottal consonant would otherwise be positioned in a syllable coda, it debuccalizes to : * ‚Üí ('hat') * ‚Üí ('scar') * ‚Üí ('rope') =Scots/Scottish English= In some varieties of Scots (and Scottish English), particularly on the West coast, a non word-final th shifted to , a process called th-debuccalization. For example, is realised as . =Proto- Greek= In Proto-Greek, shifted to initially and between sonorants (vowels, liquids and nasals). * Proto-Indo-European ‚Üí Ancient Greek () \\"seven\\" (vs. Latin ) Intervocalic was lost by the time of Ancient Greek, and vowels in hiatus were contracted in the Attic dialect. * post-PIE *«µ√©nesos ‚Üí Proto-Greek ‚Üí Ionic () : Attic () \\"of a race\\" Before a liquid or nasal, an was assimilated to the preceding vowel in Attic-Ionic and Doric and to the following nasal in Aeolic. The process is also described as loss of and subsequent lengthening of a vowel or consonant to keep the syllable the same length (compensatory lengthening). * PIE ‚Üí Proto-Greek ‚Üí Attic-Ionic () : Aeolic () \\"I am\\" =Sanskrit= In Sanskrit, becomes (written in transliteration) when utterance-final, e.g., \\"erotic love\\" becomes . Additionally, the Indo-European aspirated voiced palato-velar *«µ ∞- became , e.g. \\"arm\\" becomes Sanskrit . =West Iberian= Spanish A number of Spanish dialects debuccalize at the end of a syllable to or . Galician In many varieties of Galician as well as in Galician-influenced Spanish, the phoneme may debuccalize () to in most or all instances, though and are also possible realizations. There is also an inverse hypercorrection process of older or less educated Galician speakers replacing the phoneme of the Spanish language by , what is called . Portuguese Portuguese is much less affected by debuccalization, but it is especially notorious in its Brazilian variety. All over Brazil, the phoneme (historically an alveolar trill that moved to an uvular position) has a rather long inventory of allophones: . Only is uncommon. Few dialects, such as and , give preference to voiced allophones; elsewhere, they are common only as coda, before voiced consonants. In such dialects, especially among people speaking an educated variety of Portuguese, it is usual for the rhotic coda in the syllable rhyme to be an alveolar tap, as in European Portuguese and many registers of Spanish, or to be realized as or . In the rest of the country, it is generally realized as , even among speakers not normally using this allophone or deleting it entirely, as is common in the vernacular. However, in some - and -influenced rural registers, is used but as an allophone of (rhotic consonants are most often deleted), a merger, instead of the much more common and less stigmatized merger characteristic of all Brazilian urban centers except for those bordering Mercosur countries, where coda was preserved, and the entire North and Northeast regions. Its origin is the replacement of indigenous languages and by Portuguese, which created , and r-colored vowel as allophones of both (now mostly ) and (now mostly ) phonemes in the coda since Natives could not easily pronounce them (caipira dialect). The later Portuguese influence from other regions made those allophones become rarer in some areas, but the merger did not disappear in a few isolated villages and towns. Finally, many registers, especially those of the poor and of the youth, most northern and northeastern dialects, and, to a much minor degree, all other Brazilian dialects, debuccalize (that is, ) but less so than in Spanish. However, a merger or even a merger occurs: \\"but even so\\" or \\"though, right, the same (f) one\\" ; light \\"lighter, more slim\\", or also \\"less caloric/fatty\\" ; \\"but from me, no\\" or \\"not more from me\\" . A coda rhotic in the Brazilian dialects in the Centro-Sul area is hardly ever glottal, and the debuccalized is unlikely to be confused with it. =Romanian= In the Moldavian dialect of Romanian, is debuccalised to and so, for example, becomes . The same occurred in Old Spanish, Old Gascon and Old Japanese and occurs today in Sylheti. =Goidelic Languages= In Scottish and Irish Gaelic, s and t changed by lenition to , spelled sh and th. Loanwords Debuccalization can be a feature of loanword phonology. For example, while Korean allows certain coda obstruents, Japanese does not. Those consonants realized in Korean as unreleased voiceless stops () may be realized in Japanese as glottal stops: * ‚Üí ('porridge') * ‚Üí ('neck') * ‚Üí ('flavor') *‚Üí ('tower') Similarly, debuccalization can be seen in Indonesian loans into Selayar.

Route The route was to diverge from the O&A; near Centerville and head west through Loudoun County, crossing the Catoctin Mountain along the Goose Creek water gap, then turning northward towards the village of Goose Creek (present day Lincoln) and Purcel's Store (present day Purcellville) before continuing northerly, along the eastern base of Short Hill Mountain. At the north end of the mountain, the line was to bear westward passing around the Short Hill and Blue Ridge Mountain along the bank of the Potomac River to its confluence with the Shenandoah River, at which point it would cross the latter river to reach Harpers Ferry. Construction and demise Work started on the line in 1851, the same year as the main line of the Manassas Gap Railroad. The railroad was graded as far as Purcel's Store, including the partial construction of a tunnel under the Catoctin Mountain along the Goose Creek. Tracks were laid as far as the Old Carolina Road (present day U.S. Route 15). Construction was halted due to financial troubles of the railroad backers during the Panic of 1857. Any hope of resuming work and completing the line was erased when in 1861 when Confederate troops tore up the tracks as they abandoned Alexandria to establish a line at Manassas Junction. Today the informed and dedicated historian can still find the railroad bed and tunnel.

According to the book Bahuguna Vansh Charit (page 237) written by Dr. Ram Prasad Bahuguna, one of ancestors of Shri Asha Ramji (who belonged to the 13th generation of Shri Achyuta Nandji) came from Village Bughani (Near Srinagar, Garhwal) to settle in Odali in 1870. This is also corroborated by a map of Odali Village prepared by Shri T. F. Freeman from Survey of India in 1892.About Odali Gaon . odaligaon.com The legend says that about 800 years ago, three men from a Bandyopadhyay (anglicized to Banerjee in the 20th c.) family travelled to the Himalayas. There they came across the king of Garhwal who was suffering from a disease that no one had been able to cure. These 3 men from Bengal were very talented. they had a sound knowledge of medicine and astrology. The head of the group, an astrologer and medical practitioner, managed to cure the king. The overjoyed king asked the group leader to stay back in his kingdom and gave him a village to settle. Also, for his amazing knowledge, the king gave him the title \\"Bahuguna\\" which actually means \\"Man of many virtues (qualities)\\". The group leader from then on worked with the king and his group settled in that village, which is now in the center of Garhwal region in Uttarakhand state in India. Bahugunas are Garhwali Brahmins of Bharadwaj gotra and are classified as Gangari Brahmins in Uttarakhand. They form part of the uppermost wrung of 4 Brahmin clans of Garhwal called \\"Chauthoki Baman\\" along with Uniyal, Dobhal and Dangwal clans. The Bahugunas do not inter-marry. They were called \\"Chauthoki Baman\\" because they held many important positions in the courts of the Garhwali Kings. Some generations ago, the Chauthoki Bamans did not intermarry with other Gangari Brahmins because they held themselves superior in the caste hierarchy.

Freedom's Watch was supportive of the Bush administration's positions in the War on Terror and of Republican Congressional candidates. The group was run and supported, in part, by several former officials of the Bush administration.The donors behind those new TV ads - First Read - msnbc.com The organization stated that its goal was \\"educating individuals about and advancing public policies that protect America‚Äôs interests at home and abroad, foster economic prosperity, and strengthen families.\\" In the 2008 election cycle, Freedom's Watch purchased advertisements in support of Republican congressional candidates. In December 2008, the organization's board of directors decided to shut it down at the end of 2008.  Origins  Freedom's Watch had a working relationship with the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) and the American Enterprise Institute. The group was conceived at a Florida meeting of the RJC in March 2007 in part to counter MoveOn.org and help the Bush administration sell its Iraq policy. It was founded by a 12 people, most notably Sheldon Adelson, who donated almost all of its initial funding. Four out of five members of Freedom's Watch original board were Republican Jews, and four of the eight initial donors were Jewish, though board member Matt Brooks said \\"it would be a mistake to regard the group as having a Jewish direction,\\" and noted that \\"half of the donors contributing to the group's first $15 million ad campaign are not Jewish.\\" In 2008, the group became paralyzed by internal problems and plagued by gridlock and infighting, according to Republican operatives who criticized Adelson's insistence on parceling out money project by project, which limited the group's ability to plan and be nimble. For example, the organization spent weeks working on a package for the presidential election, but the plan did not go forward. Some staff members blamed the problems on Major Donors who micro-managed the management of the start-up. Bradley A. Blakeman former member of George W. Bush's Senior Staff was its President. Positions Freedom's Watch supported President George W. Bush's Iraq War policies. \\"More and more Democratic and Republican members agree: The surge in Iraq is working,\\" according to one ad. \\"Victory is America's only choice.\\"\\"Battle over Iraq strategy\\" New York Times retrieved 30 September 2007 The group also claimed that Iran is a grave threat to the United States and Israel. According to the group's president, \\"If Hitler's warnings were heeded when he wrote 'Mein Kampf,' he could have been stopped.\\" Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he continued, \\"is giving all the same kind of warning signs to us, and the region ‚Äî he wants the destruction of the United States and the destruction of Israel.\\" One ad called Ahmadinejad \\"a terrorist\\". Board *Ari Fleischer, a former Bush press secretary. *Matthew Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC). *Mel Sembler, a longtime RJC leader and former ambassador to Italy who helped finance the 2000 Florida recount battle. *William Weidner, a Las Vegas casino operator. The original president was Bradley Blakeman, though he resigned in March 2008 after a series of high-level staff departures. Notable donors Freedom's Watch's donors included: * Sheldon Adelson, CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation and the fifteenth-richest American in Forbes magazine's rankings last year, was the top donor. * Mel Sembler * John Templeton, Jr, board member of the Templeton Growth Fund and financier of Let Freedom Ring. * Kevin E. Moley, former U.S. ambassador to international organizations in Geneva, and a senior adviser to Dick Cheney during the 2000 campaign. * Howard Leach, CEO of Leach Capital and former ambassador to France who also helped fund the Florida recount. * Anthony H. Gioia, head of Gioia Management and former ambassador to Malta. * Richard Fox, co-founder of the Republican Jewish Coalition. * Gary Erlbaum, owner of Greentree Properties. * Ed Snider, owner of the Philadelphia Flyers and 76ers. Advertising On August 22, 2007, Freedom's Watch announced a $15 million advertising and grass-roots campaign in 20 U.S. states to maintain Republican support for President Bush's policies.\\"Democrats Refocus Message on Iraq After Military Gains.\\" Washington Post The advertising campaign emphasized the sacrifice of U.S. troops and their families in Iraq. As The New York Times wrote, \\"Several of the group's spots suggested that Iraq, rather than Al Qaeda, was behind the September 11 attacks, even though the independent September 11 commission investigation and other inquiries found no evidence of Iraq's involvement.\\" ABC News, among others, concurred: \\"The ads also link the war with September 11, despite no reliable evidence Iraq played any role in those attacks.\\" In one advertisement, a war widow claims, \\"I lost two family members to Al Qaeda -- my uncle, a firefighter, on 9/11, and my husband, Travis, in Iraq. Congress did the right thing, voting to defeat terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan,\\" adding that, \\"Switching their votes now, for political reasons, it will mean more attacks in America.\\" In another ad, an Iraq war veteran states, \\"They attacked us, and they will again. They won't stop in Iraq.\\" On September 13, the group aired a new television ad, challenging a MoveOn.org advertisement which questioned the integrity of General David Petraeus saying \\"General Petraeus or General Betray Us?\\" and \\"Cooking the Books for the White House.\\" The advertisement stated, \\"Name calling, charges of betrayal it's despicable. It's what MoveOn shamefully does ‚Äî and it's wrong. America and the forces of freedom are winning. MoveOn is losing. Call your Congressman and Senator. Tell them to condemn MoveOn.\\" They also planned to run print advertisements on the subject.\\"Pro-Bush group airs new war ads\\" Associated Press Freedom's Watch also purchased advertisements during the 2008 election cycle in support of Republican congressional candidates. For example, the group purchased $550,000 in advertising in the Mississippi 1st district special election in support of Republican candidate Greg Davis.A House Race Holds Clues for GOP, Susan Davis, The Wall Street Journal, May 13, 2008. The group also ran ads in support of Republican candidates in two other special elections to fill vacant house seats in Illinois and Louisiana. All three Republicans were subsequently defeated by their Democratic challengers in historically Republican districts. Criticism In 2008, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee charged that, in a Congressional race in Louisiana, Freedom's Watch was running a television advertisement with a script that came from the National Republican Congressional Committee. Such coordination with the NRCC would be illegal for Freedom's Watch because of the latter's status as an independent group. A media consultant working for Freedom's Watch responded that the apparent origin of the script with the NRCC was the result of an innocent mistake.

They are bicyclic terpenes that contain 20 carbons and a decalin core.  Classification  The clerodane diterpenes are classified into four groups trans-cis (TC), trans-trans (TT), cis-cis (CC), and cis-trans (TC) based on the relative stereochemistry at the decalin junction (trans or cis) and the relative stereochemistry of the substituents at C-8 and C-9 (trans or cis). The absolute stereochemistry of the clerodanes is classified as neo (shown below) or ent-neo (enantiomeric to neo). The neo-clerodanes share the same absolute stereochemistry as clerodin. Approximately 25% of clerodanes have the 5:10 cis ring junction. The remaining 75% have a trans 5:10 ring junction. The clerodane skeleton contains 20 carbons and a decalin core. There are four additional distinctions that refer to the stereochemistry of the decalin ring junction and the substituents on the C-8 and C-9 carbons.  Biosynthesis  They are structurally related to the bicyclic labdane diterpenes. Its biosynthesis in plants (mostly present in the families Lamiaceae and Asteraceae) takes place in the chloroplasts. Some forms can be useful intermediates in organic synthesis. Some clerodanes like clerodin (3-desoxy-caryoptinol) from the leaves of Clerodendrum infortunatum (Verbenaceae) have anthelminthic properties, others like ajugarins are repellent to herbivore predators (mostly insects and their larvae) or have a very bitter taste, such as gymnocolin. Some examples for clerodanes are ajugarins I to V extracted from bugleweeds like Ajuga remota, Ajuga ciliata, Ajuga decumbens, common skullcap (Scutellaria galericulata), and germanders (Teucrium sp.), cascarillin from Croton eluteria, calumbins from Jateorhiza columba, Jateorhiza palmata and guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia), gymnocolin from Gymnocolea inflata, hardwickiic acid from Hardwickia species (Fabaceae).

It was published in Japan, North America and the PAL regions by Marvelous Entertainment, Natsume and Rising Star Games respectively for the Nintendo DS. Gameplay The bottom screen of Rune Factory 2: A Fantasy Harvest Moon shows the protagonist battling an enemy in a cave, while the top screen shows a map of the location. Rune Factory 2: A Fantasy Harvest Moon has gameplay similar to its predecessor. The game runs on its own clock and calendar; while the player is outside, one in-game minute passes every second. All four seasons are included, though there are only 120 days in the year, with 30 days per season. The weather varies from day to day - while it is typically sunny, there are occasional rainy days, and, rarely, storms might damage crops and force the player to stay indoors. The player begins with two tools, the hoe and the watering can, allowing the player to till the land and grow various plants after the player purchases or obtains seeds. Each type of seed has a different growth rate and cost, and some plants can be harvested multiple times. In the beginning of the game, the player is given a farm littered with rocks, stumps, and various objects littered throughout. Once the seeds are sown, the player must water them daily, and after several days of growing, they will be able to be picked and either sold, given away, eaten, or stored. For the most part, each plant may only be planted in one particular season, and if, for example, a spring plant is in the ground during summer, it will die. Plants can be grown in certain areas outside the farm, where the climate is unchanging; however, these areas must be watered by the player, and usually contain enemies. The player interacts with objects and townsfolk through dialogue similar to a visual novel, including representing the townfolk with anime-styled images to narrate the story. In addition, cut scenes occur at certain points in the storyline. While every NPC has \\"Friend Points\\" that can be increased by visiting them and giving them items, seven female characters also have a statistic called \\"Love Points\\" that increases as the player shows them affection. When the Love Point total reaches ten, the player can then marry the character and raise a child, who becomes the second protagonist. The child is unable to marry, but can conduct a \\"love ceremony\\" instead. The player character has two types of statistics: ability statistics and battle statistics. The former show how well the player can execute a certain task, while the latter are standard role-playing game statistics. These battle statistics can be improved either by defeating enough enemies to level up or by equipping a particular weapon or piece of equipment. The player's skills include basic tasks such as farming, fighting, and mining, and they level up as the player carries out these tasks. A specific tool is usually required for every task; some tools can also be used as weapons. While exploring, the player can fight monsters to increase their strength, or befriend them and keep them as livestock, farmhands, or as battling companions. Items harvested from livestock kept in barns can be sold for money or used to cook. Plot =Setting= The game has several different areas. The main area is the player's farm, where they do most of their farming and living in. The player's house has the basic amenities, including a refrigerator, a bed, a table, and others. The player has a diary that they can use to save their progress, and a mailbox from which the player may occasionally receive mail. Just south of the farm is the seaside town of Alvarna, which has a variety of locations, including shops, houses, and other facilities. There are several monster-infested dungeons throughout the game, each based in one of the seasons. The player can find land fit to farm with, as well as monsters that can be fought or captured. Rune Factory 2 features festivals on specific days of the year. Most of the festivals are original ones from Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons and Rune Factory, though some are based on real-world festivals, such as New Year's Eve. Stores are not open on holidays, with the exception of the bathhouse, which is closed on Mondays. =Story= A boy with amnesia wanders to a town named Alvarna. He meets a girl named Mana who gives him a farmland and tools to use and names himself \\"Kyle\\" (which can be changed). Upon developing his life with a new identity, he is married to a chosen bride and conceives a child with her; a son or daughter depending on the player's choice named \\"Aaron\\" or \\"Aria\\" respectively (which, again, can be changed). Later he helps build a school for the town. One day, he regains his memory and remembers why he came to Alvarna, and why he felt so strongly to build the school. He then leaves his family in the middle of the night. A few years later, his child following clues left behind by the father, learns about the existence of Fiersome, a dragon who was sealed 1000 years ago. The child also discovers the father left so he could merge himself to Fiersome to restrain the dragon's powers. The child defeats and seals the dragon away with the spell Dragon Break. Upon doing so, the father's spirit is sealed along with the dragon's. The child continues to find a way to separate the father's spirit from Fiersome back home and finds the spell Omni- Gate which manages to bring the father back home and reunites him with the family and friends he left behind. Development According to Marvelous's managing director and Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons's creator, Yasuhiro Wada, Rune Factory 2 does not borrow the Harvest Moon(Bokuj≈ç Monogatari) name for the Japanese release. This was done in order to grow Rune Factory as an independent series and Marvelous will continue to do this with all future installments including Rune Factory Frontier. Despite this, Natsume applied the subtitle A Fantasy Harvest Moon to Rune Factory 2. The American pre-order bonus was a plush squirrel that was included in the box when ordered from participating websites. Related media =Manga= Rune Factory 2 has had multiple manga series to help promote the game, in such magazines as Dengeki Nintendo DS, Monthly Wings, Dragon Age, and Dengeki Maoh. If players pre- ordered the game in Japan, they would receive a free CD with three mini-dramas as well as an 18-page art book. =Music= Sometime after the release of the game in Japan, a CD with all the background music, three mini-dramas, and the two theme songs was released with a novel based on the game following sometime after. Reception Rune Factory 2 received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN said that \\"this sequel is not very far removed from its predecessor at all... that doesn't make it a bad game.\\" Notes References External links Official website Role-playing video games Action role-playing video games Marvelous Entertainment Neverland (company) games Nintendo DS games Nintendo DS-only games Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Rune Factory Simulation video games Video games developed in Japan Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender 2008 video games ","title":"Rune Factory 2"},{"id":"12899811","text":"Euphorbia biselegans is a species of plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.
