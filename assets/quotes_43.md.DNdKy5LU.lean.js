Biography He was born in Elberfeld, Germany on October 4, 1866. He came to the United States in 1890. He was active as a choral conductor, and as a result wrote mainly choral music, although some of his songs are also extant. He conducted the Brooklyn Choral Union, the German Theatre in Philadelphia, the Mendelssohn Glee Club, the Beethoven Society, and the New Choral Society. In 1916 he conducted several performances by the Oratorio Society of New York and the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.Programs, New York Philharmonic City College stadium, where Koemmenich conducted Percy MacKaye's vast masque Caliban He was the conductor of the chorus and orchestra for a huge civic or community masque (with a cast of 1500 amateur performers) entitled Caliban by the Yellow Sands by Percy MacKaye which played at the New York City College Stadium (the Lewisohn Stadium) from 23 May to 5 June 1916, for the Shakespeare Tercentenary celebrations.

Koemmenich also conducted an open-air performance of Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem at the Polo Grounds, New York City, on 4 June 1916. He conducted an augmented New York Philharmonic Orchestra of 120 players and a chorus of 1,200 singers, selected from leading local choral societies including the Oratorio Society of New York, the Peoples' Choral Union, the Beethoven Society and the Mendelssohn Glee Club. The soloists were Louise Homer (under the assumed name of 'Lucile Lawrence'), Maria Gay, her partner Giovanni Zenatello and Leon Rothier.Further review on Flickr of the event (scroll down the page) & photo (Library of Congress call number: LC-B2-3874-13). Rehearsals had been going on for a month, possibly taken by Arnaldo Conti who was also billed as a conductor;Retired by this time, Conti was previously conductor of the Boston Opera Company from 1909 to 1913. but he seems not to have actually conducted during the performance. In June 1917 two hundred members of the Oratorio Society held a protest meeting in Carnegie Hall because he had not been re-elected as conductor, a position he had held for five years.

Naval Ordnance Lord Baltimore Press (1921) p.156 Origin Gunfire support from cruisers and battleships had become an established part of United States amphibious warfare doctrine during World War II. As the last of the wartime cruisers and battleships were decommissioned, the 5\\"/54 caliber gun became the largest available for such assignments. The 5\\"/54 could fire a 70-pound (32-kg) projectile approximately 15 miles (24 km) in comparison to a range of 17 miles (27 km) for 260 pound (118 kg) projectiles from the 8\\"/55 caliber guns of heavy cruisers.Campbell, John Naval Weapons of World War Two Naval Institute Press (1985) pp.131&143 The impending loss of capability was anticipated by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) in 1969. CNO established a requirement for a new gun capable of firing semi- active laser guided projectiles (SAL GP). Development took place through 1971 and 1972 at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division.Miller, John C., Col USMC & Peterson, H.W., Major USMC \\"Guns vs. Butter - Without the Guns?\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings January 1982 pp.33‚Äì34 Prototype The 8\\"/55 Mark 71 gun was a single gun adaptation of the 8\\"/55 Mark 16 gun found in triple turrets on Des Moines class cruisers. The prototype gun mount weighed 86 tons and was approximately 20 percent heavier than the 5\\"/54 caliber Mark 42 gun it replaced. The prototype could fire ten to twelve rounds per minute from a 75-round automatic ready service magazine for semi-fixed ammunition when operated by one man. A specially modified Mark 155 ballistic computer provided 8\\"/55 ballistics for Hull's Mark 68 gun fire control system. Termination At-sea technical evaluation occurred aboard Hull in 1975, and operational testing followed through 1976. The Operational Test and Evaluation Force determined that inaccuracy made the gun operationally unsuitable, and concluded the lightweight 8\\"/55 gun would be no more effective than a 5\\"/54 gun firing theorized Rocket Assisted Projectiles, which ultimately never materialized. The report recommended against production or installation of the lightweight 8\\"/55, and program funding was terminated in 1978 (together with US Army's planned –ú2–ê2 - 'Terra star', mobilized field- gun which was terminated a year before, following the higher-prioritized and highest US military's command echelon more preferred USAF's advent of A-10 Thunderbolt II a year earlier).

While the design met the requirements of Air Board Specification A1(a) for a replacement for the Sopwith Camel, it was principally produced to test the abilities of Armstrong Whitworth's new design team, and was not considered a serious competitor for the requirement.Tapper 1988, p. 79.

The aircraft was a two-bay biplane with a square section fuselage. The engine in the nose was enclosed by a circular cowl with a deep hump above the cowl housing two .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns that fired through the propeller arc using synchronisation gear.Taylor 2001, p. 47 The first prototype made its maiden flight during April 1918.Tapper 1988, p. 82.

It grows on flat and dry sandy areas, and occasionally on rocky slopes.Ephedra cutleri in Flora of North America @ efloras.org Anchored by the rhizomes and an advantageous root system, Ephedra cutleri leaves grow in an opposite orientation but can not sustain all growth. Because the leaves are too small to perform photosynthesis, it is conducted in the sticky stems of the plant.  Cultivation  In one study, E. cutleri was the major plant found in Northeastern Arizona where dry, loamy, fine sand surfaced layers of Sheppard series soils dominate and form coppice dunes due their strong rhizomes.Harmon S. Hodgkinson. ‚ÄúRelationship between Cutler Mormon-Tea [Ephedra Cutleri] and Coppice Dunes in Determining Range Trend in Northeastern Arizona.‚Äù Journal of Range Management, no. 3, 1983, p. 375. EBSCOhost, doi:10.2307/3898491. Stabilized dunes are preferred at higher elevations. Evapotranspiration of waste water studies have been performed where E. cutleri is the predominant established plant species. Their adaptation to the arid conditions of the desert landscape provide ideal functionality of evaporating the deposited water.  Uses  A food source for animals, there are differing views as to whether the plant has any medicinal properties for humans with the exception of brewing Mormon tea. Another source indicated the stems contain ephedrine which can be used to treat respiratory symptoms.  Taxonomy  The plant was originally described by Robert Hibbs Peebles in 1940. It was placed in section Ephedra sect. Asarca.Price, R. A. (1996). Systematics of the Gnetales: A review of morphological and molecular evidence.

Design and development In early 1918, the British Air Ministry wrote RAF Specification Type 1 for a single-seat fighter to replace the Sopwith Snipe. The specified engine was the ABC Dragonfly, a new radial engine which had been ordered into production based on promised performance before any testing had been carried out. To meet this specification, Armstrong Whitworth's chief designer, Fred Murphy, produced the Armstrong Whitworth Ara, three prototypes being ordered.Bruce 1965, p.20. The Ara was a two-bay biplane. It had a square fuselage, the engine was covered in a pointed cowling, but with the cylinder heads exposed. The upper wing was low to give the pilot a better upwards view.Taylor 1990, p.48. As with the other fighters built to meet the Type 1 specification, the Dragonfly engine proved to be the Ara's undoing, demonstrating hopeless reliability. Two of the three prototypes were completed, the first flying in mid-1919. The Ara was abandoned towards the end of the year when Armstrong Whitworth closed down its aircraft department.Mason 1992, p.148.Note: Armstrong Whitworth purchased the engineering company Siddeley-Deasy in 1920, splitting off its aircraft department to form the Sir W.

Historically, epic literature has been considered an exclusively male domain, to the extent that \\"epic and masculinity appear to be almost coterminous.\\" From Homer's Iliad to Milton's Paradise Lost, the epic canon has been defined by works authored by men, and the characteristic subject matter and diction of the epic have carried connotations of masculinity. Recently, however, feminist literary critics have identified a number of texts written by women which, they argue, deserve to be considered epics, as they have many of the required qualities: emphasis on heroism, nation building, religious authority, a strong quest motif, and significant length. Because these texts post-date Milton's Paradise Lost - conventionally considered to be the last authentic epic in the Western tradition - they are by default \\"modern epics\\". However, argue these critics, this is by no means a contradiction. The epic remains an authentic and vital literary genre, and one to which women have made valuable contributions.Schweizer (2006), p. 6  Poetry Epics by Women  * Faltonia Betitia Proba's A Virgilian Cento Concerning the Glory of Christ or Cento was written in fourth century AD. The epic poem uses verses by Virgil in a re- ordered form to recount the life of Jesus. * Mary Tighe's Psyche (1805) uses the Spenserian stanza form originated by Edmund Spenser in his Elizabethan epic The Faerie Queene. In Tighe's epic poem the goddess Venus, out of jealousy for the attentions Psyche receives, commands Cupid to make Psyche fall in love with a monster. * H.D.'s Helen of Egypt (1961) is an American epic poem that reinvents the myths surrounding Helen, Paris, Achilles, Theseus, and other ancient Greek characters, fusing storylines with the mysteries of Egyptian hermeticism. *Giannina Braschi's Empire of Dreams (1988) is a postmodern poetry epic about the immigrant's journey from the margins to the center of American culture. Climatic episode takes place at the top of the Empire of State Building, Macy's, and St. Patrick's Cathedral, during a pastoral invasion of modern day New York City. *Alice Notley's The Descent of Alette (1996) is a feminist poetry epic which critiques the epic poem itself. It explores a heroine's (Alette) journey through the underworld, re-imagined as an underground subway station, of which she and others are destined to spend eternity at the hands of the Tyrant, a patriarchal figure who controls the world.

It is an alternative method to indicate a battery's State of Charge (SoC). The Depth of Discharge is the complement of State of Charge: as one increases, the other decreases. While the State of Charge (SoC) is usually expressed using percentage points (0% = empty; 100% = full), Depth of Discharge (DoD) is usually expressed using units of Ah (e.g, 0 is full and 50 A h is empty) or percentage points (100% is empty and 0% is full). The capacity of a battery may be higher than its nominal rating. Thus it is possible for the depth of discharge value to exceed the nominal value (e.g., 55 A h for a 50 A h battery, or 110%). At least in some battery technologies, such as lead-acid AGM batteries, there is a correlation between the depth of discharge and the cycle life of the battery.http://support.rollsbattery.com/support/solutions/articles/4346-agm- discharge-characteristics Depth of Discharge is defined as the capacity that is discharged from a fully charged battery, divided by battery nominal capacity.

The title renders Swabia as \\"Suavia.\\") is an early Elizabethan stage play, first published in 1599 but written perhaps three decades earlier (c. 1570). It is often regarded as a characteristic example--perhaps the best surviving example--of the type of drama that was extremely popular in the early Elizabethan period. The work \\"best represents the characteristics of pre-Greenian dramatic romance.\\"Maurice Hunt, \\"Romance and Tragicomedy,\\" in Kinney, p. 386. Publication Sir Clyomon and Sir ClamydesThe modern critical literature utilizes various shortened titles for the play; this is perhaps the most common. Others are Clyomon and Clamydes and Syr Clyomon and Clamydes (Bullough). was first printed in 1599, in a quarto issued by stationer Thomas Creede.Chambers, Vol. 4, p. 6. The title page makes no attribution of authorship; it does state that the play was \\"sundry time\\" performed by Queen Elizabeth's Men. That playing company originated in 1583; if the play is as old as some commentators judge it, the company's version must have been a revival. Genre The play has been called a \\"comedy, or, more properly, tragicomedy\\",Forsythe, p. 313. though it falls securely into the category of romance, an enormously popular genre in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.Prose romances of chivalry--the type of novel satirized by Miguel de Cervantes in Don Quixote--were very much in fashion in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, in England as elsewhere in Europe. Multi-volume novels like The Mirror of Knighthood and Palmerin of England sold widely in Shakespeare's generation, and the generations before and after him. Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene is a more serious, elevated, elegant approach to the same literary tradition. Clyomon and Camydes is an extravagant example of stage romance. In his Defense of Poetry, Sir Philip Sidney generally defended the poets and poems of his era from their critics; but in a famous and often-quoted passage he also ridiculed the fanciful and wild romances then common on the popular stage, in which: > ...you shall have Asia of the one side, and Affrick of the other, and so > many other under-kingdoms, that the player, when he commeth in, must ever > begin with telling where he is, or else the tale will not be conceived. Now > you shall have three ladies walk to gather flowers, and then we must believe > the stage to be a garden. By and by, we hear news of shipwreck in the same > place, and then we are to blame if we accept it not for a rock. Upon the > back of that comes out a hideous monster, with fire and smoke, and then the > miserable beholders are bound to take it for a cave. While in the meantime > two armies fly in, represented with four swords and bucklers, and then what > hard heart will not receive it for a pitched field?\\"Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. > 40-1. A quick summary of the physical locations in this play confirms and even accentuates Sidney's description: the drama opens in Denmark, \\"and passes successively to Swabia, to the Forest of Marvels on the borders of Macedonia, to the Isle of Strange Marshes twenty days' sail from Macedonia, to the Forest again, to the Isle again, to Norway, to the Forest, to the Isle, to the Forest, to a road near Denmark, to the Isle, to Denmark.\\"Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 39. Verse The play is composed in the rhymed fourteener or heptameter verse that was popular in its era. When the heroine Neronis (daughter of Patranius, late King of the Isle of Strange Marshes) enters the Forest of Marvels in male disguise, she speaks this: > As hare the hound, as lamb the wolf, as fowl the falcon's dint, > So do I fly from tyrant he, whose heart more hard than flint > Hath sack'd on me such hugy heaps of ceaseless sorrows here, > That sure it is intolerable, the torments that I bear. The meter has a jog-trot rhythm to a modern ear, but poets like Sidney and Arthur Golding employed it for works of serious intent. Authorship and Origin There is no evidence from the Elizabethan era to indicate the author of Sir Clymon and Sir Clamydes. Scholars and critics have proposed George Peele, Thomas Preston, Robert Wilson, and one Richard Bower.Chambers, Vol. 4, p. 6. No convincing case has been made for any single candidate. The source for the basic story is the Roman de Perceforest, an extensive prose romance that has come down to us in four manuscripts dated to the fifteenth century. As medievalist Sylvia Huot sums it up and documents, \\"Perceforest is the undisputed source for the Elizabethan play Clyomon and Clamydes, composed about 1576‚Äì77 and printed in 1599.\\"Sylvia Huot, Postcolonial Fictions in the Roman de Perceforest (Gallica, Volume 1), Cambridge: D. S. Brewer, 2007, p. 5 and footnote 13. Influence Clyomon and Clamydes is thought to have had an influence on several of Shakespeare's plays. Most notably, Rosalind in As You Like It disguises herself in male clothing and flees courtly life for residence among simple shepherds--just as Neronis does in her play.Bullough, Vol. 2, pp. 155-7. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, the playlet of the mechanicals in Act V bears a resemblance with Clyomon and Clamydes, though in this case the resemblance is clearly in a spirit of parody.Salingar, pp. 69-70. And the late romance Cymbeline bears a significant relationship with Clyomon and Clamydes.Forsythe, pp. 313-14. Shakespeare uses a personified figure of Rumour as a Chorus at the start of Henry IV, Part 2; the same figure appears in Clyomon and Clamydes. Synopsis Clamydes, son of the King of Swabia, has a problem: he cannot marry his beloved, Juliana, until he slays a dragon that has been killing and eating maidens and matrons. Clamydes must bring Juliana the severed head of the \\"flying serpent.\\" Juliana's brother Clyomon, son of the King of Denmark, takes Clamydes' place when the Suavian king is knighting his son--effectively stealing his brother-in-law-to-be's knighthood. (Clyomon is originally accompanied by a clown character called Subtle Shift, or Knowledge--a version of the Vice character in the medieval morality play. Shift quickly shifts sides to Clamydes when it's in his interest; though he later betrays Clamydes as well. The play's personification of Rumour is another holdover from its medieval antecedents.) Sir Clyomon sets off on his knightly adventures, which lead him to the Macedonia of Alexander the Great (a figure commonly featured in chivalric romance). Clamydes pursues Clyomon, seeking revenge for his stolen knighthood; meanwhile he kills the dragon in an offstage fight. But he falls victim to the spells of the evil magician Bryan Sans Foy, who steals Clamydes' arms and apparel (and his dragon's head). Bryan intends to take Clamydes' place and marry Juliana. Clyomon is driven by storms to the Isle of Strange Marshes; he falls in love with the princess Neronis. He vows his fealty to her--and returns to his adventures. (He has sworn to meet and fight with Clamydes, so his knightly honor compels him.) Thrasellus, the King of Norway, also loves Neronis; she has rejected him, and so he kidnaps her. She, however, escapes for him, and in male disguise seeks refuge with the shepherd Corin. (Neronis is \\"the earliest known example of a girl disguised as a page\\"Wynne, p. 176. in English Renaissance drama, making her the ancestress of Lyly's Gallathea and Phillida, Shakespeare's Rosalind and Viola, and all their successors.) Clyomon tries to rescue Neronis; he meets, fights, and kills Thrasellus. Yet since the man is a king, Clyomon gives him an honorable burial, decorating the hearse with his own shield. Neronis finds hearse and shield, and mistakes the dead man for Clyomon. In grief, she sings a song and tries to kill herself with Clyomon's sword--when Providence descends from the heavens to stop her. He assures her that she will find her living beloved soon. Neronis, still in boy's clothes, takes service as page with a disguised Clyomon. (Thrasellus's hearse remains onstage from one Forest scene to the next--even though an Isle scene intercedes between them.) After their abundant adventures, problems are resolved in the end. The two knights become friends when Clamydes realizes that Clyomon is a prince of Denmark and Juliana's brother; they return north. Neronis realizes that she is working for the man she loves. Clamydes chases away the cowardly Bryan Sans Foy. Neronis reveals her true identity. The couples plan their weddings as the play concludes. Notes References * Bullough, Geoffrey, ed.

The main protest was in the Buenos Aires Obelisk. Demonstrations were also held in other parts of the city, such as Cabildo and Juramento (a main intersection in Belgrano), in front of the department of Cristina Kirchner (in Recoleta), and in other cities: C√≥rdoba, Santa Fe, Mendoza, Tucum√°n, Mar del Plata, Lomas de Zamora, Adrogu√©, Avellaneda (Santa Fe), Viedma. Protests were also held in Punta del Este, Uruguay. The protests were organised mainly through social networks, by accounts that oppose the government, but with a nonpartisan focus, since no political party claimed the protests, and neither any party emblems were seen in the protests. Still, some politicians who oppose the government took part in the protests as private citizens, such as Patricia Bullrich, the leader of the PRO party. The government of the time accused the participants of being \\"anti-quarantine\\" and mocking the pandemic containment efforts.  Causes  On the March 12th, 2020, a strict lockdown was established across Argentina. This, at first, caused a spike in the positive image of President Alberto Fern√°ndez during March. Several causes made it went down over the following months of \\"preventive and mandatory isolation\\", reaching in August a record-low positive image since the start of the lockdown measures. Opinion Polls showed a sharp decline in economic expectations of the population, primarily in the future employment and prices expectations. People who approved the handle of the pandemic went from a 91.7% in March to a 62.4% in June, while disapproval went from a 5.5% in March to a 35.8% in June. On the 9th of July, protesters rallied against the government on the Buenos Aires Obelisk and in several other points of the country.Protests in the 9 de Julio Avenue On the 30th of July, the President sent the Congress a Bill for Justice Reform with the objective, according to Fern√°ndez, of being able to \\"better organize the Federal Justice and overcoming the crisis affecting the credibility and well- function of the Federal Criminal Justice. This project foresaw the unification of Criminal and Economic Justice and the creation of 23 new courts, what would dilute the influence of the country's 12 federal judges, as well as the merger of appeal courts and imposing several new procedure rules for Federal Judges. Also, an Advisory Board was created to propose reforms on the Supreme Court and the Council of Magistracy. In August, negative image of Alberto Fernandez surpassed, for the first time, the positive one. Only one poll, conducted by the state-owned UBA School of Social Sciences, showed a larger positive than negative image on the President. In the Buenos Aires Province, primarily the Greater Buenos Aires, an increase in crimes committed by people with no previous record was seen, qualified as \\"survival crime\\" by the Minister of Security of the province, Sergio Berni. This increase on crime was heavily covered by mass media and was one of the protesters claims. The National Ministry of Security, Sabina Frederic, stated: \\"The are not so much robberies [...] we are seeing violence acts during crime happening, which are being alerted, mainly, by mass media, which make them visible and follow-up the cases\\". After this statements, the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers (Santiago Cafiero) added: \\"What I know is what the Ministry of Security, Frederic, is proposing according to a statistics comparing with the last year. Now, comparing with March, there are there are obviously more cases\\".

They provide legal advice and traditional casework for free, primarily funded by federal, state and local government. Working with clients who are mostly the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in Australian society, they also work with other agencies to address related problems, including financial, social and health issues. Their functions may include campaigning for law reform and developing community education programs. The peak body is Community Legal Centres Australia. CLCs are the equivalent of law centres in the UK and community law centres in New Zealand. There are eight Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS), with similar characteristics to CLCs. There are also eight Legal Aid Commissions (LACs), which are state and territory government agencies, such as Victoria Legal Aid, which administers Commonwealth and state government funding of CLCs.  History  The Aboriginal Legal Service was founded in 1970 in Redfern, Sydney, to provide services to Aboriginal Australians, and was the first free legal service in Australia. CLCs were subsequently established in Victoria in the early 1970s and spread quite rapidly to other states and territories. Although from the outset they shared some similarities with the already established American \\"neighbourhood law offices\\" and British law centres, in their insistence upon effecting systemic change and their largely voluntary support base they had characteristics distinct from each. They grew out of broader concerns for social justice that gained momentum in the 1960s and which found expression in the anti-war and women's movements, Aboriginal rights campaigns, and other pushes for far-reaching social change in both the Australian and global contexts.Chesterman 1996: 11‚Äì43 However, CLCs are a unique expression of these social justice and protest movements and do not claim particular ties to any other campaigns. Throughout their history different CLCs have usually held common platforms in only general, rather than specific, terms. When the first Victorian CLCs were established, they were often resisted by a legal establishment that was defensive about CLCs' criticisms of the elitism or inaccessibility of the legal professions, suspicious of CLCs' aims and methods, and concerned about protecting profits.Chesterman 1996: 69‚Äì70, 77‚Äì83; Noone and Tomsen 2006: 73; Greenwood 1994: 3‚Äì5 However, soon after the Fraser government came to power in December 1975, some members of the wider legal profession had begun to acknowledge the importance of CLCs in improving the public's access to the law.Chesterman 1996: 87 Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, CLCs consolidated their position in the Victorian and wider Australian legal landscape, forging ties with different government and legal organisations (such as various state legal aid commissions). Today CLCs are independent, not-for-profit, community-based organisations providing a range of services to people in Australia, including people experiencing discrimination and disadvantage. , there are about 180 CLCs. Community Legal Centres Australia is the umbrella organisation for eight state and territory CLC associations. While some CLCs have developed close links with others, centres, for the most part, serve their own particular geographic or special interest communities, such as family law and family violence, credit and debt, consumer law, social security, migration, tenancy law, discrimination, employment law and child protection. Some centres focus on providing services for particular segments of the population, such as women, refugees and asylum seekers, older persons, children and youth, people with disabilities or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Centres provide various legal services, including legal advice and traditional casework, to individuals at little or no cost, as well as undertaking early intervention and preventative strategies, such as community education and development in legal skills, and engaging in advocacy for policy and law reform. They emphasise the demystification of the law and the empowerment of communities in their relation to the law, particularly by encouraging communities to be involved in their activities.Paula O'Brien, 'Changing Public Interest Law: Overcoming the law's barriers to social change lawyering' (2011) 32 AltLJ 80. They develop and facilitate partnerships between providers of legal assistance and legal and non-legal services (such as domestic violence organisations, community health organisations, housing services, drug and alcohol services). They may also undertake test case litigation, critique police powers and behaviours, and monitor prisons systems and conditions. Equivalent services are provided in the UK by law centres and in New Zealand they are called community law centres.  Funding  Community legal centres are partly funded by a complex and variable mix of state and federal government monies, offered both directly (such as through grants) and indirectly. They are also funded by the proceeds of casework. However, they rely heavily upon the efforts and support of extensive volunteer networks, both lawyers and non-lawyers, to staff them without payment, without whom they would not survive. Reviews of the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services 2015-2020 (NPA) and the Indigenous Legal Assistance Program (ILAP) were undertaken in 2018. On 2 April 2019 the Attorney-General, Christian Porter, said that \\"guaranteeing stable and long-term funding certainty for legal services delivered by Legal Aid Commissions (LACs), Community Legal Centres (CLCs) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS) was part of the [Morrison] Government's plan for a stronger economy\\" and baseline funding would be increased from in 2019-20 to (indexed) ongoing from 1 July 2020. The announcement included plans for a single National Mechanism to deliver legal assistance funding from 1 July 2020, a \\"unified administrative mechanism that provides guaranteed and quarantined funding to LACs, CLCs and ATSILS\\". 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 Australia (CC BY 3.0 AU) license.

ATSILS Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS) are independent, non-profit, non- government bodies that provide a range of culturally sensitive services to Indigenous Australians. Their main focus is criminal and family law, and eligibility is limited to those on low incomes. They also advocate for law and policy changes, such as those which have a bearing upon the high rate of Indigenous incarceration in Australian prisons, provide and the Law Council of Australia is a strong ally. The Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT), established in 1970, was the first dedicated Aboriginal legal service, and can be regarded as the first ATSILS. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (established 1973) has been providing legal services under contract in Victoria since April 2005, and the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia for WA. The system was expanded to Queensland that June, and to additional States and Territories thereafter.

He is best known for his time with WWE under the ring name Konnor. After spending four years wrestling on the independent circuit as Ryan O'Reilly, Parmeter signed a contract with WWE in 2005, and was sent to its developmental territory Deep South Wrestling (DSW), where he wrestled as Roughhouse O'Reilly. He won the DSW Heavyweight Championship twice, before briefly appearing in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). In October 2007, Parmeter requested to be released from his WWE contracts for personal reasons. Following his release, Parmeter took time off from wrestling, before debuting for NWA Charlotte in February 2009. In July 2010, he was re-signed by WWE, and returned to FCW, where he began wrestling as Conor O'Brian. He was part of the fourth season and the fifth season of the NXT competition show. In 2011, Parmeter was one of the founding members of The Ascension as a stable that also included Kenneth Cameron, Tito Colon and Raquel Diaz. It later became a tag team consisting of Konnor and Viktor, who would go on to win the NXT Tag Team Championship and hold it for 364 days, the longest of any championship team. They were promoted to the main roster in December 2014, becoming part of the first ever tag team Elimination Chamber match, before both Konnor and Viktor were released from the company in December 2019. Professional wrestling career Early career (2001‚Äì2005) Parmeter initially trained at the School of Hard Knocks in southern Florida under Rusty Brooks, and made his professional wrestling debut in 2001. He went on to compete in Brooks' promotion, Four Star Championship Wrestling (FSCW) as Ryan O'Reilly, and formed a tag team with J-Dawg, known as \\"The Irish Thug Connection\\". Together, The Irish Thug Connection won the FSCW Tag Team Championship. He also won the FSCW Heavyweight Championship, and spent mid-2004 feuding with Norman Smiley over it. O'Reilly also competed for Florida's Coastal Championship Wrestling (CCW) promotion, and won the CCW Heavyweight Championship. He appeared for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling during the promotion's early shows. World Wrestling Entertainment (2005‚Äì2007) After four years on the independent circuit, O'Reilly signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2005. He was assigned to Deep South Wrestling (DSW), a WWE developmental territory as Roughhouse O'Reilly, and made his DSW debut at the inaugural DSW show on September 1, in a loss to Jack Bull. Over the next several months, he faced wrestlers including \\"Big Time\\" Nick Mitchell, Mike Mizanin, Shawn Schultz, Derrick Neikirk, Eric P√©rez and Freakin Deacon. In December, he appeared in a dark match prior to the SmackDown tapings. In early 2006, O'Reilly took a leave of absence. Upon his return, he and Danny Germundo entered a tournament for the DSW Tag Team Championship but were eliminated by Team Elite (Mike Knox and Neikirk) on May 11. On June 22, O'Reilly defeated Neikirk to win the DSW Heavyweight Championship. He successfully defended the championship against Knox, Neikirk, and Montel Vontavious Porter. On September 7, O'Reilly lost the championship to Bradley Jay. During mid-2006, O'Reilly made several appearances at ECW house shows, teaming with Neikirk to face The FBI (Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke). O'Reilly was scheduled to become part of the regular ECW roster in September, but violated the WWE Wellness Program, and was suspended for 30 days. When he returned, he became the personal assistant of DSW General Manager Krissy Vaine. In December, O'Reilly appeared on an episode of ECW as one of Paul Heyman's personal enforcers alongside Doug Basham. In March 2007, O'Reilly won the DSW Heavyweight Championship for the second time. He lost the championship to Bradley Jay a week later. O'Reilly and Eric Perez were originally scheduled to face The Samoans (Afa, Jr. and Sonny Siaki) in the main event of DSW's final event, but he and Perez were replaced by The Major Brothers. During mid-2007, O'Reilly would appear in dark matches prior to Raw and SmackDown against Sylvan Grenier, Chuck Palumbo, Super Crazy, Cody Rhodes and D'Lo Brown. He briefly appeared in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), another WWE developmental territory, where both Lacey Von Erich and Maryse acted as his valets. In October 2007, both Parmeter and his girlfriend Krissy Vaine requested and were granted their release from WWE. They cited health problems suffered by members of both of their families as the reason. Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2010) Parmeter in 2009 In October 2007, Parmeter stated that he was taking time off from wrestling. He returned to wrestling in February 2009, working for NWA Charlotte. He wrestled against Truitt Fields for the territory's Heavyweight Championship, but was unable to win the title. After the loss, O'Reilly formed an alliance with Mikael Judas and Phill Shatter called III, which lasted until the territory's closure.  Return to WWE  = Developmental territories (2010‚Äì2011) = Parmeter was re-signed by the WWE on July 14, 2010, and was reassigned to the FCW developmental territory. On August 12, he debuted for Florida Championship Wrestling as Ryan O'Riley losing to Conrad Tanner. He would compete under this name for a short while before becoming Conor O'Brian on September 30. On November 30, 2010, during the season finale of season three of NXT, it was announced that Parmeter, under the name Conor O'Brian, would be appearing on season four, with Alberto Del Rio as his mentor. He made his in-ring debut on NXT the following week, teaming with Del Rio to defeat rookie Derrick Bateman and Bateman's mentor Daniel Bryan. O'Brian won his first challenge on the January 4, 2011 episode of NXT, when he won the 'Battle of the Mic Challenge' to earn four immunity points. Two weeks later, on January 18, O'Brian was the second contestant eliminated from NXT. Earlier that night, O'Brian competed in a match against Ricardo Rodriguez in a losing effort. In March 2011, O'Brian was selected as one of the six former NXT contestants to return to the show in its fifth season, NXT Redemption. During this season, O'Brian was mentored by Vladimir Kozlov. He was later eliminated from competition on the June 28, 2011 episode of NXT, and would later be joined, and eventually replaced, by a returning Derrick Bateman and Daniel Bryan. = The Ascension (2011‚Äì2019) = Conor O'Brian in 2013 On August 28, 2011, Ricardo Rodriguez announced the formation of a stable called The Ascension, with members including O'Brian, Kenneth Cameron, Tito Colon and Raquel Diaz.http://forums.onlineworldofwrestling.com/showthread.php/17403-FCW- Ascension The first match to include all members in some capacity came on September 1, 2011, and saw Cameron, Colon and O'Brian, accompanied by Diaz, defeating CJ Parker, Donny Marlow and Johnny Curtis. On September 30, Cameron and Colon had a shot at the FCW Tag Team Championship but lost to the current champions of CJ Parker and Donny Marlow. By October, however, video packages appeared promoting the Ascension under new seemingly demonic, supernatural characters, and did not include Rodriguez as he was disassociated from the team. By the end of November the Ascension had all but disbanded because O'Brian was injured, Colon had been called up to WWE to team with his cousin Primo, and Diaz became Queen of FCW and distanced herself from the group. This left Cameron as the sole survivor of the Ascension, continuing to use the Ascension gimmick during his appearances. On March 15, 2012, O'Brian returned accompanying Cameron to the ring in his match against Byron Saxton; the match ended in disqualification when O'Brian interfered. Cameron and O'Brian began wrestling as a tag team using the name The Ascension, and their first tag team match together came on March 23 when the two defeated Jason Jordan and Xavier Woods. The Ascension suffered their first loss when the pair lost to the FCW Tag Team Champions Corey Graves and Jake Carter, in a title match. With the conclusion of NXT Redemption, WWE rebranded its developmental territory FCW into NXT. O'Brian and Cameron, as The Ascension, debuted on the June 20 episode of the rebooted NXT taped at Full Sail University, where they defeated Mike Dalton and CJ Parker. The Ascension then started a feud with The Usos, defeating them on the September 5 NXT, and also scored a win over Justin Gabriel and Tyson Kidd on the October 3 NXT. Two weeks later, the Ascension teamed up with Kassius Ohno to defeat Richie Steamboat and the Usos. The Ascension disbanded on November 30, 2012 when Cameron was released from WWE. O'Brian retained his character while using \\"The Ascension\\" as his nickname as he started to feud with Big E Langston for the NXT Championship. O'Brian first faced Langston in a non-title match, which ended in a double disqualification. O'Brian then faced Corey Graves in a number one contender match which had no winner when the Shield attacked both men to make a statement. The next week, O'Brian defeated Graves and Bo Dallas to become the number one contender. The feud ended after O'Brian was defeated in a title match on the April 4 episode of NXT. On the May 29 NXT, O'Brian competed in an 18-man number one contender battle royal and was eliminated by Corey Graves and Kassius Ohno. To reform the Ascension tag team, Rick Victor allied himself with O'Brian as they went chased the NXT Tag Team Championships held by Adrian Neville and Corey Graves. On November 10, 2013 O'Brian's name was tweaked and shortened to \\"Konnor\\". On February 27, 2014 at NXT Arrival, he and Viktor successfully defended the NXT Tag Team Championships against Too Cool, repeating the feat on May 29, 2014 at NXT TakeOver against the team of El Local and Kalisto. Viktor and Konnor, as the Ascension, in March 2015 Konnor, alongside Viktor, made his main roster debut on the September 9, 2014 episode of Main Event, with the duo defeating Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando) in a tag-team match to promote their NXT tag title defense against The Lucha Dragons (Kalisto and Sin Cara) at the NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way event. On the December 12 episode of SmackDown, vignettes began to air promoting The Ascension's call-up to the main roster. The Ascension made their debut on the December 29 episode of Raw, quickly defeating The Miz and Damien Mizdow. The Ascension would continue to squash local athletes three weeks in a row on Main Event while indirectly criticizing of The Road Warriors. Their first major victory as part of the main roster was a win over The New Age Outlaws at the Royal Rumble. The Ascension suffered their first pinfall loss on the main roster on February 23 episode of Raw, losing to The Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil). At WrestleMania 31, The Ascension made their WrestleMania debut in the Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal where both failed to win the match. On the May 11 episode of Raw, during a match between Curtis Axel and Macho Mandow, in the guise of Randy Savage, The Ascension attacked Axel and Mandow. It was then announced that the Ascension would face Axel and Mandow on the Payback pre- show, where they won the match. It was announced the Ascension would par take in a six team elimination chamber match for the WWE Tag Team Championship. At Elimination Chamber on May 31, he and Viktor eliminated the Los Matadores and The Lucha Dragons until they were eliminated by The Prime Time Players, ultimately losing the match. On the September 3 episode of SmackDown, The Ascension aligned themselves with Stardust by attacking Neville before their match, and thus forming a group known as \\"The Cosmic Wasteland\\". At Night of Champions, The Cosmic Wasteland defeated Neville and the Lucha Dragons on the pre-show. On the Survivor Series kickoff, The Cosmic Wasteland, The Miz, and Bo Dallas were defeated by The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), Neville, Goldust and Titus O'Neil, in a traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match. On the Royal Rumble kickoff, The Ascension lost a Fatal 4-Way tag team match to qualify for the Royal Rumble match. At WrestleMania 32, Konnor competed in the Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal but failed to win the match. On April 16, 2016, Konnor was suspended for 60 days for his second violation of the Wellness Program. On the June 24 episode of Superstars, Konnor returned from suspension when The Ascension faced the Golden Truth (Goldust and R-Truth) in a losing effort. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, The Ascension were drafted to SmackDown, making their debut on the July 26 episode in a WWE World Championship No. 1 Contender's Six-Pack Qualifying Battle Royal, which was won by Apollo Crews. At the SummerSlam kickoff, The Ascension competed in a 12-man tag team match where their team lost. They then entered the SmackDown Tag Team Championship tournament, where they were eliminated in the first round by The Usos. On the September 27 episode of SmackDown Live, The Ascension picked up their first win on the brand, when The Ascension and The Usos defeated Heath Slater, Rhyno and American Alpha (Chad Gable and Jason Jordan) in an eight-man tag team match. At 2017 Elimination Chamber, The Ascension competed in a tag team turmoil match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship where they were the final team eliminated. Konnor, alongside Viktor, would later enter the Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania 33, but both men were eliminated from the match. At Money in the Bank (2017), The Ascension lost to Breezango after they claimed responsibility for a vandal attack in their office. On the June 27 episode of SmackDown Live, The Ascension was interrogated by Breezango on \\"Fashion Vice\\", admitting that they didn't commit the crime and only took responsibility, because they wanted a match at the PPV. In September, the duo turned face when they started trying to befriend Breezango during the latters' 'Fashion Files' segments. On the January 9 episode of SmackDown Live, The Ascension a loss to The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan), for a while the duo would only appear as supporting characters in Breezango's Fashion Files skits.

Early pioneer aeroplanes such as the Wright flyer used the flexible characteristics of lightweight construction to control flight through wing warping. Others made collapsible wings for folding away, such as the flying car designs by Gustave Whitehead. Since the 1960s flexible wings have dominated hang glider and ultralight aircraft designs, with such types as the delta-shaped Rogallo wing and the fully collapsible paraglider. More recently, the advent of high-strength flexible materials and other advanced technologies has renewed interest in the use of flexing for control purposes. __TOC__ Pioneer aircraft Control The first effective control system on a powered aircraft allowed one to fly for the first time. The Wright Flyer used wing warping for lateral or roll control, by twisting one wing tip to increase its angle to the air while twisting the other to reduce its angle. The Wright brothers patented system was widely copied. However, as engine powers and air speeds rose, so too did the forces needed to operate the pilot controls and by 1914 warping was all but abandoned. Collapsibility Predating successful controlled and powered flight, collapsible wings had been developed in an attempt to solve the problems of ground storage and transport. A system of radial ribs like a giant folding fan, sometimes described as bat-like, was used by some pioneers, notably Gustave Whitehead in his attempts to build a flying car. Aeroelasticity Aeroelasticity is the natural tendency of any wing to flex under aerodynamic and inertial loads while in flight. Most designs seek to minimise the effects by making the wing structure as stiff as possible. However some have sought to use the effect to advantage. A relatively early example is provided by the flying-wing gliders of the Horten brothers during the 1930s, whose wing tips flexed upwards in flight to act as stabilising surfaces. The advent of the jet engine and transonic flight speeds brought a sharp increase in aerodynamic forces, made worse by the innate structural inefficiency of the swept wing, with the combination leading to dangerous characteristics in extreme flight conditions. The aeroisoclinic wing, developed by Geoffrey T. R. Hill in the 1950s and flown on the Short SB.4 Sherpa, was an attempt control the flexing in such a way as to maintain handling characteristics in all flight regimes. Similar aeroelastic tailoring was later applied to experimental forward-swept wings, where it is a necessity for any safe design. Lightweight aircraft In 1948 the husband-and-wife team of Francis and Gertrude Rogallo developed a flexible kite which could be collapsed for storage. A key part of their design is the mixed use of tension lines and aerodynamic forces to stabilise and control the wing. The wing remains a constant shape in flight under wind pressure, and the lines are used to control its position. Over the following years they developed the design and then Francis, working at NASA's Langley research centre, further developed the concept into proposals for manned aircraft such as a space vehicle re- entry system. Following a series of talks in 1959 and 1960 his ideas spread rapidly and two designs in particular, the Rogallo delta and the paraglider, were soon being used for kites, hang gliders and ultralight aircraft. Types with an engine backpack for the pilot are known as powered gliders. Although tested for spacecraft descent, no Rogallo types have been used by NASA. Rogallo wing Francis Rogallo evolved his trademark double-delta \\"parawing\\" during the 1950s. Unlike the earlier kites it uses several struts to maintain its planform, while still relying on air pressure from beneath to develop its conical upper profile. Parafoil Like the original Rogallo kites, the parafoil is fully collapsible. But unlike them it is double- skinned. Comprising an open-fronted aerofoil wing, it is held in shape by the pressure of air from in front. Many flexible ribs are needed to hold its aerofoil shape. Advanced concepts In the 21st. century, new materials possessing both flexibility and strength are being experimented with, in order to merge control surfaces into the main wing surface.NASA Boeing study flexible wing control: Aviation Week blogFlying on flexible wings: Scientific American For example, a flexible wing flap has been test flown on a Gulfstream III.first flexible airplane wing takes flight Scientific American blog For smaller craft, the increasing sophistication of smart control systems is being combined with flexible technologies to create articulated wings which mimic the natural flexing of birds' wings in flight. It is now even practicable to use a bird-like flapping action to provide thrust as an ornithopter. The UTIAS Snowbird ornithopter of 2010 was human-powered.

Owing to the end of the War and an unreliable engine, it was unsuccessful, only three being built. Development and design In 1918, Britain's Royal Air Force issued the Type III specification for a replacement for the Bristol F.2 Fighter to be powered by the new ABC Dragonfly radial engine. The Austin Motor Company, who had produced large numbers of aircraft, including 800 Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, submitted a design by J Kenworthy, formerly of the Royal Aircraft Factory, which was named the Austin Greyhound. An order for three prototypes was placed on 18 May 1918.Bruce 1965, pp29-30. The Greyhound was a two-bay biplane of all-wooden construction.Mason 1992, p.133. The Greyhound's engine was covered by a conical cowling, with the cylinder heads protruding. The circular shape of the cowling continued down the fuselage. The upper and lower wings were almost the same size.Taylor 1990, p.49. While the first prototype was quickly built, problems with the Dragonfly engine, which was found to be overweight and underpowered, and to have unsolvable reliability problems, meant that testing was delayed, with the second prototype being delivered to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham Heath in January 1919, being followed by the first prototype in May and the third in February 1920. Although performance was good no production was ordered of any of the competitors, with the Bristol Fighter remaining in service until 1932. The last Greyhound remained in use as a flying test bed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough until June 1922.

Habitat  This plant is located in Algeria, Chad, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Spain, Tunisia, and the western Sahara. It can be viewed at elevations between 10 meters to 700 meters above sea level.  Characteristics  This plant is described as a green, dioecious shrub. Each flower is either male or female needing two different for seed formation. It prefers well drained, loamy soil in an area with direct sunlight. Once established the plant is hardy, resistant to drought and lime. The leaves bud in an opposite fashion with the plant being green all year. A shrub often found on rocky calcareous slopes. Flowering time is between February‚ÄìMay. Fruiting time is between April‚ÄìMay. The ripe female cone is eaten by animals. Taxonomy It was originally described by Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines in 1799 and placed in section Pseudobaccatae (=sect. Ephedra), \\"tribe\\" Scandentes. This being due to the similarity in stem and leaf structure and organization. In 1996 Robert A. Price classified E. altissima in section Ephedra without recognizing a tribe.Price, R. A. (1996). Systematics of the Gnetales: A review of morphological and molecular evidence. International Journal of Plant Sciences, 157(6): S40-S49.  Threat  As a result of the plant having such a widespread location, there are no specific major threats. This plant was last assessed by IUCN in August 13, 2010 with a least concerned rating. Due to the non-concerned attitude toward the endangerment of the species, no seeds have been collected as an ex situ conservation measure. It is not known to occur in any protected areas.  Medicinal uses  The members of this genus have alkaloid ephedrine which are integral in the treatment of asthma and other related respiratory issues. By using the entire plant and not just the stem it has been observed, as compared to isolated ephedrine, to have few side effects. This is used to treat symptoms not cure respiratory issues. Young plants have the best potency if ingested raw while older plants are best to be dried and used in a tea.

The bonds having been called in for redemption, were presented at the Treasury for that purpose by the holders, respectively, J.S. Morgan & Co. and L. Von Hoffman & Co., but payment was refused by the United States on account of the adverse claim of the Manhattan Savings Institution, and the claims of the several parties to the proceeds were Treasury, March 12, 1880, pursuant to ¬ß 1063, Revised Statutes. Judgments were rendered by that court in favor of the Manhattan Savings Institution, and against the other claimants respectively. 18 Ct.Cl. 386. The several appeals bring up all the cases as they stood in the Court of Claims; the United States appealing from the judgment in favor of the Manhattan Savings Institution, the other parties from the judgments dismissing their respective petitions. The controversy is wholly between the claimants, the United States being merely in the position of a stakeholder, not denying its liability to pay to the true owners of the bonds. The act of Congress in pursuance of which the bonds in question were issued, being \\"An act to provide ways and means for the support of the government,\\" approved March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 468, c. 77, provided: The bonds issued under this act were called the consolidated debt or consols of 1865, because, in addition to the loan of six hundred millions of dollars authorized by it, the Secretary of the Treasury was empowered to permit the conversion, into any description of bonds authorized by it, of any Treasury notes or other obligations, bearing interest, issued under any act of Congress.

The Act of July 14, 1870, \\"to authorize the refunding of the national debt,\\" 16 Stat. 272, authorized the issue of three classes of bonds, according as they bore interest at the rates of five percent, 4¬Ω percent, and 4 percent per annum, amounting in the aggregate to $1,500,000,000, which the Secretary of the Treasury was, by the second section of the act, authorized to sell and dispose of at not less than their par value in coin, and \\"to apply the proceeds thereof to the redemption of any of the bonds of the United States outstanding, and known as five-twenty bonds at their par value,\\" or, the act continues, \\"he may exchange the same for such five-twenty bonds, par for par.\\" By the fourth section of this act, it was provided: By an Act passed January 20, 1871, 16 Stat. 399, the foregoing act was amended so as to authorize the issue of five hundred millions of five percent bonds instead of two hundred millions, as limited by the Act of July 14, 1870, but not so as to permit an increase of the aggregate of bonds of all classes thereby authorized.

It was expected and desired by Congress that this should be so, as the Secretary of the Treasury had been expressly authorized by law to dispose of any of the bonds of the United States, \\"either in the United States or elsewhere.\\" Act March 3, 1865, ¬ß 2. And under the Refunding Act of July 14, 1870, as we have already seen, the Secretary of the Treasury established an agency in London for the purpose of delivering the bonds sold under that act and receiving in exchange therefor the outstanding securities of the United States agreed to be received in payment therefor. The object of this great exchange was to reduce the annual interest on the public debt of the United States from six to the lower rates of five, four and one-half, and four percent. To have called in the redeemable debt and paid for it in gold coin, and to have obtained the gold coin for that purpose by sales of the new securities, would have been awkward, circuitous, and impracticable, involving the needless export and import of a mass of the gold coin distributed by the necessities of the world's commerce throughout its markets, the attempt to do which would have produced disturbances of market values, certain to have defeated it. Any transfer of specie in large amounts to meet balances occasioned by these operations would have been almost as serious in its effects, and was therefore by every consideration of public and private interests to be avoided. The difficult practical question was how to avoid it‚Äîhow to substitute in the markets of the world one loan for the other by an exchange of securities without any serious and disturbing movement of coin. Congress had placed it within the power of the Secretary of the Treasury to accomplish this by authorizing him to receive the five-twenty bonds, to be redeemed in exchange at par for the bonds to be issued at a lower rate of interest. This he was enabled to do by calling in the five-twenty bonds for redemption, by which they were made equal in value as money to par and interest then due and by agreeing to treat and receive them as money in the exchange. This created a demand for the \\"called bonds\\" to be used for that purpose, and they were bought from the holders by bankers and agents of the syndicates who had contracted to place the new loans under the act of 1870. This transaction could only have been successfully effected upon the assumption that the call for redemption did not affect the negotiable quality of the bonds, nor impose upon them any disability except the cessation of interest after the maturity of the call, nor deprive them of any other immunity which had previously belonged to them. On the contrary, it must have been within the contemplation of the Treasury Department and of those with whom it was dealing that the \\"called bonds,\\" until finally absorbed by payments into the Treasury in exchange for new bonds, which constituted the fact of redemption, were equivalent in all legal qualities to money itself or to those usual equivalents of money which circulate, without question as such, like Treasury notes, payable on demand. And this view, we have already seen, the parties were authorized and justified in adopting by the language and purposes of the statutes under which the transactions were accomplished. By this means, an enormous public debt was shifted and converted, so as largely to reduce the burden of its interest; the agents of the government were facilitated in the great work they had undertaken; the individual holders of the securities of the United States, scattered throughout the countries of Europe, received the money due them on the bonds for which they subscribed at their own domiciles, and this series of great financial operations was successfully accomplished without interference with the usual course of the business of the world, without disturbing the fixed distribution of currency which commerce had apportioned to its appropriate markets, and without unsettling the value of property or labor either at home or abroad. These beneficial results were greatly facilitated, if not made feasible, by the unquestioned negotiability of the called bonds, which, when subjected to the right of redemption reserved by their terms, were thereafter considered and treated as the equivalent of money. This could not have been if the principles which protect bona fide purchasers for value, in the due course of trade, without actual notice of a defect in the obligation or title, had not been practically adopted. The practice as found to have existed was in our opinion well warranted by law. This confidence was invited by the convenience of the government itself, and certainly promoted its interests and advanced its purposes. The practice it engendered on the part of the public dealing in its securities had been expressly sanctioned by formal recognition and approval by the Treasury Department long prior to the negotiation of the war loans, which commenced in 1862. In 1860, Attorney General Black officially advised the Secretary of the Treasury, 9 Opinions 413, that Treasury notes, redeemable after one year from date, interest thereon to cease at the expiration thereafter of sixty days' notice of readiness to pay and redeem the same, were intended to be a continuing security and to pass by delivery, after the period of redemption equally as before, as money or banknotes not liable to any equities between the original or intermediate parties.

According to John Earl Bassett, most of the stories in Death in the Woods were written between 1926 and 1930 with four preceding that time and one following.Bassett (2005), 69 The Stories The collection is made up of 16 stories: * Death in the Woods * The Return * There She Is‚ÄîShe is Taking Her Bath * The Lost Novel * The Fight * Like a Queen * That Sophistication * In a Strange Town * These Mountaineers * A Sentimental Journey * A Jury Case * Another Wife * A Meeting South * The Flood * Why They Got Married * Brother Death Plot of the title story \\"Death in the Woods\\" is presented as a first-person narrative by an unreliable narrator, who tells the story of an old woman, Mrs. Grimes. Mrs. Grimes lives on the edge of society and survives by selling eggs and using the proceeds to buy food for herself, her small family and the animals in her care. Her husband is considered to be a horse thief, and the couple is looked down on by others. Mrs. Grimes' personal history, according to the narrator, is that she was abandoned by her mother and grew up as an indentured servant. It is suggested that there she received inappropriate attentions from her German master. The master's wife was suspicious and perhaps cruel toward her. Mrs. Grimes agrees to marry Jake Grimes, who \\"helps\\" her escape her German master and his wife. Mrs. Grimes and Jake Grime have a son and a daughter, but the daughter died in childhood. The narrator tells us that their son grows up to be like his father. Both of them verbally abused Mrs. Grimes and treat her in a manner similar to the way the German and his wife had treated her. She does not know life could be any different as this is all she ever experienced, according to the narrator. Her main concern in life is taking care of, and feeding the animals and people in her care. Her duty, she feels, is to feed animal life. On the last day of her life, Mrs. Grimes walks into town to trade some eggs and buy some meager supplies. Her dogs follow her into town. According to the narrator, the butcher was unusually friendly and compassionate on this visit (because of the snowy, cold weather), giving her some extra liver and speaking to her kindly. She begins her walk home late in the day. On her way home, she leaves the road and walks through the woods, probably a short cut. On this shortcut she reaches a clearing where she sits down to rest. While sitting down, she dies. The dogs, that had been following her, run around her in circles, then rip the pack away from her and devour the food inside. The body is discovered by a hunter, who goes into town and tells everyone about the body in the woods. A group of men and some boys, including the narrator, walk into the woods to examine the body and bring it back. When the narrator and his brother return home, the older brother tells the story. Our narrator set down his version of the story many years later, because he felt that his brother had not been able to properly and efficiently explain the events. There are other stories that are re-tellings of events or stories told by unreliable narrators- meaning they do not necessary give readers accurate, cold-hard facts. The stories are from their points-of-view, or how they interpret the events or happenings. It is their \\"working out\\" of their past experiences. References Sources * Bassett, John Earl (2005).

It is a Leopard hunt game (or Leopard game). One tiger is going up against six leopards. The leopards attempt to surround and trap the tiger while the tiger attempts to capture enough of them (usually 3) so that the leopards can not immobilize the tiger. It is unknown how old the game is, however, the game was documented by Captain James Low in the 1839 periodical Asiatic Researches; or, Transactions of the Society, Instituted in Bengal, For Inquiring into The History, The Antiquities, The Arts and Sciences, and Literature of Asian, Second Part of the Twentieth Volume and specifically in chapter X On Siamese Literature (1839) in which he authored. There may be a very similar game played in Sri Lanka called Hat diviyan keliya.  Goal  Leopards win if they surround and immobilize the one tiger. That is, the tiger can not move on its turn. The tiger wins if it captures three leopards, as there are not enough of them to immobilize the tiger.  Equipment  The board used is a triangle dissected by two lines across its breadth, and one line across its length through its central axis. This makes for 10 intersection points. There are six white pieces representing the leopards, and one black piece representing the tiger. The leopard pieces and tiger piece are played on the intersection points.  Game Play and Rules  1\\\\. Players decide what animal to play. Players alternate their turns throughout the game. The board is empty in the beginning with the exception to the tiger piece which is placed on the top vertex of the triangle (the top vertex is the corner of the triangle where the vertical line running down the length of the triangle dissects it). 2\\\\. The Leopards start first. All six leopard pieces must be dropped first before any of them can be moved. Only one leopard piece can be dropped per turn, and they are dropped onto any vacant point on the board during the Leopard's turn. 3\\\\. The Tiger on its turn may either move the tiger one space onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board, or use it to capture a leopard piece. After all the leopards have been dropped, a leopard can move one space per turn onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board. Only one leopard may be moved per turn. Unlike the tiger, leopards can not capture. 4\\\\. The tiger captures a leopard by the short leap as in draughts. The tiger must be adjacent to the leopard, and leap over it onto a vacant point on the other side following the pattern on the board. Only one capture is allowed per turn. Captures are not compulsory.

Biography He received instruction at the Maulbronn monastery, and in 1784 became a student at T√ºbinger Stift, where he met Friedrich H√∂lderlin (1770‚Äì1843), Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770‚Äì1831) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775‚Äì1854). In 1790 he moved to Jena, where he studied Kantian philosophy under Karl Leonhard Reinhold (1757‚Äì1823). Subsequently, he became an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Jena, where he remained until 1804. In 1806, he was Protestant Oberschulkommissar (upper school administrator) of Franconia, and the next year, he became Central Commissioner of Education and a member of the Protestant General Consistory of Bavaria. In 1797, with Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762‚Äì1814), Niethammer was co-editor of the Philosophische Journal. In 1798, the journal published Friedrich Karl Forberg's Entwicklung des Begriffs der Religion (\\"Development of the Concept of Religion\\"), an essay that Fichte prefaced with √úber den Grund unsers Glaubens an eine g√∂ttliche Weltregierung (\\"Grounds of Our Belief in a Divine Government of the Universe\\"). Reaction to the article included accusations of atheism, sparking the so-called 1798‚Äì99 Atheismusstreit (atheism dispute), an event that eventually led to Fichte's 1799 departure from Jena.NNDB, Johann Gottlieb Fichte In 1808, Niethammer published Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit (\\"The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time\\"), a book that was a reaction to philanthropinism, an educational concept that was developed during the Age of Enlightenment. Philanthropinism valued practical and physical education and largely rejected rote-learning of the classics. Niethammer agreed with the philanthropinists in that a measure of autonomy was important in education, but he found their teaching philosophy too extreme. He believed that a sense of civics and civility were vital in a child's education, and made efforts to combine the best of philanthropinism with the best of \\"humanism\\", a word that he derived from Cicero's \\"humanitas\\".

Coral Reefs 16: S39-S46 Climate and Oceanographic conditions of Pacific Panama. The climate of Panam√° is largely affected by the position of a low atmospheric pressure zone known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which also affects seasonal evolution of geostrophic currents in the Panam√° Bight. During the rainy season (December through May), the ITCZ is located to the North of Panam√° and produces light and variable winds and ocean circulation in the Panam√° Bight is anticyclonic (west) which creates a southerly flowing coastal current. As a result of these punctuated seasonal movements of the ITCZ, Panam√° experiences high seasonal rainfall often reaching more than 3000 mm/yr. Starting in October and continuing into the dry season (January to March) the ITCZ moves South of Panam√°,Rodriguez- Rubio E, Jose Stuardo (2002) Variability of photosynthetic pigments in the Colombian Pacific Ocean and its relationship with the wind field using ADEOS-I data. Proc. Indian Acad. Sci (Earth Planet. Sci.) 11: 227-236 producing a dominant period of northeasterly tradewinds known as the Panam√° Jet, which results in a reversal of water circulation and becomes a cyclonic gyre with a coastal current flowing to the north. Upwelling develops in the Gulf of Panama during the dry season when northeast tradewinds from the Caribbean blow over to the Pacific through a physiographic gap in the central mountain range which divides the Isthmus. This wind stress creates seasonal Ekman spiral pumping and displaces nutrient-poor coastal surface water with cool, nutrient rich, water masses.Rodriguez-Rubio E, Wolfgang Schneider (2003) On the seasonal circulation within the Panama Bight derived from satellite observations of wind, altimetry and sea surface temperature. Geophysical Research Letters 30: 63-67 Seasonal effects on Marine Life WHOI scientists at LJL installing a Video Plankton RecorderThis nutrient rich upwelling such as occurs in the Gulf of Panama, can stimulate Plankton production leading to blooms of centric, colonial, and penate diatoms and dinoflagellates. Zooplankton populations often respond to this by subsequently increasing growth and reproduction rates. Scientists are now able to quantify the abundance and diversity of these microscopic organisms in-situ with sensors such as the Video Plankton Recorder (a specialized underwater microscope and imaging system).Davis, CS, Hu, Q, SM Gallager, x Tang, C Ashjian. 2004 Real-time observation of taxa- specific plankton abundance: An optical sampling method.

Panama Liquid Jungle Underwater Tropical Observatory PLUTO PLUTO measures real time oceanographic conditions at LJL In order to understand oceanic and atmospheric coupling, and the potential effects of these phenomena on ocean life, scientists must collect time series data which measure weather patterns, ocean circulation and sea water chemistry. PLUTO is a fiber-optic cabled observatory deployed in January 2006 in approximately 18 m of water 1.5 km to the south west of Isla de Canales de Tierra. The observatory consists of sensors for salinity, temperature, pressure, water current speed and direction, chlorophyll, turbidity, oxygen, down-welling light at two depths, an array of temperature sensors. A remotely controlled, high definition pan and tilt underwater camera displays rapid image updates of the benthic habitat surrounding the PLUTO sensors. The data are distributed via satellite back to WHOI and made available on the web (http://4dgeo.whoi.edu/panama/). Coral Reefs of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) 3-D mapping of coral reef habitats with SCUBA COP optical imaging dive sledCoral reefs usually exist in the euphotic zone (shallow areas of the sea where light can penetrate) along coastal or island areas, and require clear, oligotrophic (low nutrient) water in a narrow temperature and salinity range. Littoral areas located along the Southern Isthmus of Panam√° demonstrate highly complex ecological interactions and distributions of endemic and migratory marine species due in part to the overlap of continental ecotones, tropical weather patterns and the convergence of powerful sea currents.Glynn PW, J.S. Ault (2000) A biogeographic analysis and review of the far eastern Pacific coral reef region. Coral Reefs 19: 1-23 In the Republic of Panam√°, there is estimated 290 km2 of reefs along both Caribbean and Pacific coasts, however much higher diversity (about 68 hard coral species) occurs in the Caribbean, compared to 33 known species from 11 genera living along the Pacific coast.Cortes J, Guzman, Hector (1998) Organsimos de los arrecifes coralinos de Costa Rica: descripcion, distribucion geografica e historia natural de los corales zooxantelados (Anthozoa: Sleractinia) del Pacifico.

Besides the direct effects of overfishing, anchor damage, and coral mining, terrestrial land use affects coral reef habitats in more indirect ways. Panam√° experiences high seasonal rainfall (3000 mm/yr.) and reefs can be severely impacted if corals are chronically exposed to the runoff of nutrients originating from deforestation and soil erosion, fertilizers, pesticidesGlynn PW, L.S.

From 1995-2008, the brewery was located in the West Flanders municipality of Assebroek, a suburb of Bruges. In 2008 it relocated to the village of Mater in Oudenaarde, East Flanders and changed its name to simply \\"Smisje\\". Smisje is known for beers in both traditional Belgian styles and others, but particularly for brewing with distinctive ingredients and flavorings,\\"Drinks\\" by Vincent Gasnier, Durnling Kinderly pub. 2005, p. 240 often fruits or herbs. This experimental brewery exports roughly half of its annual product outside Belgium to countries such as the United States, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Denmark. Despite its minuscule size, for many years Smisje has kept six beers in regular production in addition to a large variety of seasonal and occasional brews. Many of their beers have featured label art by Brooklyn cartoonist and craft beer enthusiast Bill Coleman. In 2010, the brewery announced that it would be discontinuing all of its historic products in order to focus on a new blond, hoppy ale to be called \\"Smiske\\". Only the annual \\"Smisje Christmas\\" would be preserved. Following the example of Duvel Moortgat, who offered to brew again their limited-edition \\"Duvel Triple Hop\\" if 10,000 people would sign a petition for it, Brandt announced that if 20,000 people would join a Facebook group supporting it, he would offer to brew one additional historic recipe per year.http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=126573157364335 Technical Brandt began brewing in 1995 with a jury-rigged system capable of producing only 250 liters per batch, and slowly expanded the equipment over time in the original Bruges location. The new premises in Mater utilize the second-hand equipment of the now-defunct De Teut brewery of Neerpelt. The brewer maintains his own distinctive house yeast strain and utilizes primarily native Belgian hops. In addition to various spices and non-traditional ingredients such as sloe berries, Smisje is known to utilize the traditional Belgian method of using a significant amount of candi sugar in their recipes to lighten the body of stronger brews. Beers Beers formerly in regular production: *'t Smisje Blond - 6% ABV: A moderately strong golden-colored ale flavored with linden blossoms. *'t Smisje Dubbel - 9% ABV: A strong brown ale in the Belgian Abbey Dubbel style which uses fresh dates in the recipe. *'t Smisje Tripel - 9% ABV: A beer in the Belgian Abbey Tripel style. *'t Smisje Wostyntje - 7% ABV: A strong golden ale flavored with mustard seeds from the nearby village of Tourhout.\\"All Belgian Beers\\" by Hilde Deweer, Stichting Kunstboek pub. 2008 *Vuuve - 5% ABV: A cloudy wheat beer in the Belgian Witbier style, brewed with coriander and bitter orange peel.

It was completed to that city and beyond to York (south of Santaquin) in 1875, and bought by the Union Pacific Railroad later that year. The UP organized the Utah Southern Railroad Extension in 1879, and completed the line to Frisco in 1880. Both companies merged with the Utah Central Railroad (Salt Lake City-Ogden) to form the UP- controlled Utah Central Railway in 1881, and in 1889 it was merged with the Utah and Northern Railway and other companies to form the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway, which was reorganized as the Oregon Short Line Railroad in 1897.Don Strack, UtahRails.net: Union Pacific in Utah, 1868-1899, accessed August 2008 The Salt Lake, Sevier Valley and Pioche Railroad was incorporated in 1872 to build west from Salt Lake City, and the Utah Western Railway, organized in 1874, acquired its unfinished roadbed and completed the narrow gauge line to a point near Stockton in 1877. The company was reorganized in 1881 as the Utah and Nevada Railway, and the UP gained control later that year, merging it into the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway in 1889. The Oregon Short Line later converted the track to and extended the line south to the old Utah Southern at Lynndyl, west of Leamington. This new Leamington Cut-off, completed in 1903, had better grades and alignment than the old route through Payson, which became a secondary route (and is now, where still in use, the Sharp Subdivision). The San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, half-owned by the OSL, bought the OSL's lines south and west of Salt Lake City later that year, and completed the line to Los Angeles in 1905. The short piece of the old line from Milford, where the new Los Angeles line left, west to Frisco became the Frisco Branch, and was abandoned in 1943.

The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over. It usually starts on the chest, back, and face. It then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms may include fever, tiredness, and headaches. Symptoms usually last five to seven days. Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and bacterial skin infections. The disease is often more severe in adults than in children. Symptoms begin 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily from one person to the next through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom; however, in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs. Testing for antibodies may be done to determine if a person is immune. People usually only get chickenpox once. Although reinfections by the virus occur, these reinfections usually do not cause any symptoms. Since its introduction in 1995, the varicella vaccine has resulted in a decrease in the number of cases and complications from the disease. It protects about 70 to 90 percent of people from disease with a greater benefit for severe disease. Routine immunization of children is recommended in many countries. Immunization within three days of exposure may improve outcomes in children. Treatment of those infected may include calamine lotion to help with itching, keeping the fingernails short to decrease injury from scratching, and the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to help with fevers. For those at increased risk of complications, antiviral medication such as aciclovir are recommended. Chickenpox occurs in all parts of the world. In 2013 there were 140 million cases of chickenpox and herpes zoster worldwide. Before routine immunization the number of cases occurring each year was similar to the number of people born. Since immunization the number of infections in the United States has decreased nearly 90%. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally ‚Äì down from 8,900 in 1990. Death occurs in about 1 per 60,000 cases. Chickenpox was not separated from smallpox until the late 19th century. In 1888 its connection to shingles was determined. The first documented use of the term chicken pox was in 1658. Various explanations have been suggested for the use of \\"chicken\\" in the name, one being the relative mildness of the disease. Signs and symptoms A single blister, typical during the early stages of the rash The early (prodromal) symptoms in adolescents and adults are nausea, loss of appetite, aching muscles, and headache. This is followed by the characteristic rash or oral sores, malaise, and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease. Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (exanthem). In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms, and the first sign is the rash or the spots in the oral cavity. The rash begins as small red dots on the face, scalp, torso, upper arms and legs; progressing over 10‚Äì12 hours to small bumps, blisters and pustules; followed by umbilication and the formation of scabs. At the blister stage, intense itching is usually present. Blisters may also occur on the palms, soles, and genital area. Commonly, visible evidence of the disease develops in the oral cavity and tonsil areas in the form of small ulcers which can be painful or itchy or both; this enanthem (internal rash) can precede the exanthem (external rash) by 1 to 3 days or can be concurrent. These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. Adults may have a more widespread rash and longer fever, and they are more likely to experience complications, such as varicella pneumonia. Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days before recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases. The condition usually resolves by itself within a week or two. The rash may, however, last for up to one month. Chickenpox is rarely fatal, although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications. Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with chickenpox in the previous year accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection.

Pregnancy and neonates During pregnancy the dangers to the fetus associated with a primary VZV infection are greater in the first six months. In the third trimester, the mother is more likely to have severe symptoms. For pregnant women, antibodies produced as a result of immunization or previous infection are transferred via the placenta to the fetus. Varicella infection in pregnant women could lead to spread via the placenta and infection of the fetus. If infection occurs during the first 28 weeks of gestation, this can lead to fetal varicella syndrome (also known as congenital varicella syndrome). Effects on the fetus can range in severity from underdeveloped toes and fingers to severe anal and bladder malformation. Possible problems include: * Damage to brain: encephalitis, microcephaly, hydrocephaly, aplasia of brain * Damage to the eye: optic stalk, optic cup, and lens vesicles, microphthalmia, cataracts, chorioretinitis, optic atrophy * Other neurological disorder: damage to cervical and lumbosacral spinal cord, motor/sensory deficits, absent deep tendon reflexes, anisocoria/Horner's syndrome * Damage to body: hypoplasia of upper/lower extremities, anal and bladder sphincter dysfunction * Skin disorders: (cicatricial) skin lesions, hypopigmentation Infection late in gestation or immediately following birth is referred to as \\"neonatal varicella\\". Maternal infection is associated with premature delivery. The risk of the baby developing the disease is greatest following exposure to infection in the period 7 days before delivery and up to 8 days following the birth. The baby may also be exposed to the virus via infectious siblings or other contacts, but this is of less concern if the mother is immune. Newborns who develop symptoms are at a high risk of pneumonia and other serious complications of the disease. Pathophysiology Exposure to VZV in a healthy child initiates the production of host immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. Cell-mediated immune responses are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary varicella infection. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of herpes zoster (i.e., shingles), postherpetic neuralgia, and sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. Varicella zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years. Shingles After a chickenpox infection, the virus remains dormant in the body's nerve tissues. The immune system keeps the virus at bay, but later in life, usually in an adult, it can be reactivated and cause a different form of the viral infection called shingles (also known as herpes zoster). The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) suggests that every adult over the age of 50 years get the herpes zoster vaccine. Shingles affects one in five adults infected with chickenpox as children, especially those who are immune-suppressed, particularly from cancer, HIV, or other conditions. Stress can bring on shingles as well, although scientists are still researching the connection. Shingles is most commonly found in adults over the age of 60 who were diagnosed with chickenpox when they were under the age of 1. Diagnosis Chickenpox. The diagnosis of chickenpox is primarily based on the signs and symptoms, with typical early symptoms followed by a characteristic rash. Confirmation of the diagnosis is by examination of the fluid within the vesicles of the rash, or by testing blood for evidence of an acute immunologic response. Vesicular fluid can be examined with a Tzanck smear, or by testing for direct fluorescent antibody. The fluid can also be \\"cultured\\", whereby attempts are made to grow the virus from a fluid sample. Blood tests can be used to identify a response to acute infection (IgM) or previous infection and subsequent immunity (IgG). Prenatal diagnosis of fetal varicella infection can be performed using ultrasound, though a delay of 5 weeks following primary maternal infection is advised. A PCR (DNA) test of the mother's amniotic fluid can also be performed, though the risk of spontaneous abortion due to the amniocentesis procedure is higher than the risk of the baby's developing fetal varicella syndrome. Prevention Hygiene measures The spread of chickenpox can be prevented by isolating affected individuals. Contagion is by exposure to respiratory droplets, or direct contact with lesions, within a period lasting from three days before the onset of the rash, to four days after the onset of the rash., edition (Elsevier), p. The chickenpox virus is susceptible to disinfectants, notably chlorine bleach (i.e., sodium hypochlorite). Like all enveloped viruses, it is sensitive to drying, heat and detergents. Vaccine The varicella vaccine is recommended in many countries. Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A second dose is recommended five years after the initial immunization. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if they become infected. Immunization within three days following household contact reduces infection rates and severity in children. It is part of the routine immunization schedule in the US. Some European countries include it as part of universal vaccinations in children, but not all countries provide the vaccine. In the UK as of 2014, the vaccine is only recommended in people who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox. This is to keep the virus in circulation thereby exposing the population to the virus at an early age, when it is less harmful, and to reduce the occurrence of shingles in those who have already had chickenpox by repeated exposure to the virus later in life. In populations that have not been immunized or if immunity is questionable, a clinician may order an enzyme immunoassay. An immunoassay measures the levels of antibodies against the virus that give immunity to a person. If the levels of antibodies are low (low titer) or questionable, reimmunization may be done. Treatment Treatment mainly consists of easing the symptoms. As a protective measure, people are usually required to stay at home while they are infectious to avoid spreading the disease to others. Cutting the nails short or wearing gloves may prevent scratching and minimize the risk of secondary infections. Although there have been no formal clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of topical application of calamine lotion (a topical barrier preparation containing zinc oxide, and one of the most commonly used interventions), it has an excellent safety profile. It is important to maintain good hygiene and daily cleaning of skin with warm water to avoid secondary bacterial infection. Scratching may also increase the risk of secondary infection.Brannon, Heather (21 May 2008). Chicken Pox Treatments . About.com. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) but not aspirin may be used to reduce fever. Aspirin use by someone with chickenpox may cause serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, Reye syndrome. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to varicella zoster virus, to ward off the disease. Antivirals are sometimes used. Children If aciclovir by mouth is started within 24 hours of rash onset, it decreases symptoms by one day but has no effect on complication rates. Use of aciclovir therefore is not currently recommended for individuals with normal immune function. Children younger than 12 years old and older than one month are not meant to receive antiviral drugs unless they have another medical condition which puts them at risk of developing complications. Treatment of chickenpox in children is aimed at symptoms while the immune system deals with the virus. With children younger than 12 years, cutting nails and keeping them clean is an important part of treatment as they are more likely to scratch their blisters more deeply than adults. Aspirin is highly contraindicated in children younger than 16 years, as it has been related to Reye syndrome. Adults Infection in otherwise healthy adults tends to be more severe. Treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g. aciclovir or valaciclovir) is generally advised, as long as it is started within 24‚Äì48 hours from rash onset. Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used for children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication, as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. Adults are advised to increase water intake to reduce dehydration and to relieve headaches. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are recommended, as they are effective in relieving itching and other symptoms such as fever or pains. Antihistamines relieve itching and may be used in cases where the itching prevents sleep, because they also act as a sedative. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. These include pregnant women or people who have a weakened immune system. Prognosis The duration of the visible blistering caused by varicella zoster virus varies in children usually from 4 to 7 days, and the appearance of new blisters begins to subside after the fifth day. Chickenpox infection is milder in young children, and symptomatic treatment, with sodium bicarbonate baths or antihistamine medication may ease itching. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is widely used to reduce fever. Aspirin, or products containing aspirin, should not be given to children under 16 with chickenpox, as this is linked to Reye syndrome. In adults, the disease is more severe, though the incidence is much less common. Infection in adults is associated with greater morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), hepatitis, and encephalitis. In particular, up to 10% of pregnant women with chickenpox develop pneumonia, the severity of which increases with onset later in gestation. In England and Wales, 75% of deaths due to chickenpox are in adults. Inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis, can occur in immunocompromised individuals, although the risk is higher with herpes zoster. Necrotizing fasciitis is also a rare complication. Varicella can be lethal to individuals with impaired immunity. The number of people in this high-risk group has increased, due to the HIV epidemic and the increased use of immunosuppressive therapies. Varicella is a particular problem in hospitals, when there are patients with immune systems weakened by drugs (e.g., high-dose steroids) or HIV. Secondary bacterial infection of skin lesions, manifesting as impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas, is the most common complication in healthy children. Disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of varicella pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis.Chicken Pox Complications Hemorrhagic complications are more common in the immunocompromised or immunosuppressed populations, although healthy children and adults have been affected. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known. Epidemiology Primary varicella occurs in all countries worldwide. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally ‚Äì down from 8,900 in 1990. There were 7,000 deaths in 2013. In temperate countries, chickenpox is primarily a disease of children, with most cases occurring during the winter and spring, most likely due to school contact. It is one of the classic diseases of childhood, with most cases occurring in children up to age 15. Like rubella, it is uncommon in preschool children. Varicella is highly communicable, with an infection rate of 90% in close contacts. In temperate countries, most people become infected before adulthood, and 10% of young adults remain susceptible. In the tropics, chickenpox often occurs in older people and may cause more serious disease. In adults, the pock marks are darker and the scars more prominent than in children. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require state health departments to report infections of chickenpox, and only 31 states currently volunteer this information. However, in a 2013 study conducted by the social media disease surveillance tool called Sickweather, anecdotal reports of chickenpox infections on Facebook and Twitter were used to measure and rank states with the most infections per capita, with Maryland, Tennessee and Illinois in the top three. Society and culture Etymology How the term chickenpox originated is not clear but it may be due to it being a relatively mild disease. It has been said to be derived from chickpeas, based on resemblance of the vesicles to chickpeas, or to come from the rash resembling chicken pecks. Other suggestions include the designation chicken for a child (i.e., literally 'child pox'), a corruption of itching-pox, or the idea that the disease may have originated in chickens.Chicken-pox is recorded in Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. since 1684; the OED records several suggested etymologies Samuel Johnson explained the designation as \\"from its being of no very great danger\\". Intentional exposure Because chickenpox is usually more severe in adults than it is in children, some parents deliberately expose their children to the virus, for example by taking them to \\"chickenpox parties\\". Doctors counter that children are safer getting the vaccine, which is a weakened form of the virus, rather than getting the disease, which can be fatal. Repeated exposure to chickenpox may protect against zoster. Other animals Humans aren't the only known species that the disease affects naturally. However, chickenpox has been caused in other primates, including chimpanzees and gorillas.  Research  Sorivudine, a nucleoside analog, has been reported to be effective in the treatment of primary varicella in healthy adults (case reports only), but large-scale clinical trials are still needed to demonstrate its efficacy. There has also been speculation that continuous dosing of aciclovir by mouth for a period of time can eradicate VZV from the host, although further trials remain to discern whether eradication is actually viable.

History leftAerial view of the Sparks campusWallace Community College was established as the George C. Wallace State Technical Trade School under the Alabama Regional Trade School Act of 1947. Over the following years, the institution's name was changed, first to George C. Wallace State Vocational Trade School and then to George C. Wallace State Technical Junior College, finally being reorganized in 1969 as George C. Wallace State Community College. It was the first comprehensive community college in Southern Alabama. In 1997, the Alabama Aviation and Technical College became part of WCC. However, in 2003, the Alabama Aviation and Technical College operations and the Mobile Aviation Center were transferred to Enterprise State Junior College to reflect that institution's growth as a community college. Sparks State Technical College had been founded in 1966 as Sparks State Technical School, being named after former Alabama Governor Chauncey Sparks; following a rename as Sparks State Technical Institute in 1968, it was accredited by the Council on Occupational Education until merging in 1999 with WCC. WCC is also associated with two foundations that provide financial support for its operations: the Wallace Community College Foundation, founded in 1992, and the Wallace Community College Sparks Campus Foundation, founded in 1991. In his later years, former Attorney General Richmond Flowers, Sr., taught history at Wallace Community College. His attorney general service occurred during the first term of Governor George Wallace, but the two were intraparty political rivals. In 1966, Flowers lost the gubernatorial primary to Wallace's first wife and successor, Lurleen Burns Wallace, for whom the community college in Andalusia is named. Athletics WCC maintains a men's junior college baseball team affiliated with the Southern Conference and women's softball team. Even though known as a men's junior college baseball school, back in 2001, the Wallace Community College Men's Basketball team won the AJCCC State Championship under coach Eddie Barnes and Assistant Coaches Philip M. Cassis and Tom Helmeyer. The team also made it to the NJCAA final four and finished third in the Nation. The baseball team is currently coached by former Major League Baseball catcher Mackey Sasser.

Fire safe councils accomplish this objective through education programs and projects such as shaded fuel breaks or firebreaks to protect area residents against an oncoming wildfire and to provide fire fighters with a place to fight the oncoming fire. The first fire safe councils started in the early 1990s, and there are now over 100 around the state.)An idealized county-wide fire safe council (An exception to the grassroots formation is the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. (CFSCI). Since its incorporation in mid-2002, the primary role of the CFSCI has been to operate the Fire Safe California Grants Clearinghouse (now called simply the \\"Grants Clearinghouse\\"). Thus, in the rest of this article the true grassroots fire safe councils are referred to as \\"local fire safe councils\\" (FSCs) in order to distinguish them from the CFSCI.) Local fire safe councils usually include representatives from: *Fire agencies, including the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF or CAL FIRE), the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and/or local fire protection districts as appropriate *Local governments, such as city and/or county *Businesses, especially insurance *Other agencies, such as Resource Conservation Districts *The public The fire agency and local government representatives may be members of the FSC, or may serve in an advisory capacity, depending on local needs. All local fire safe councils are independent entities. Some are organized as non-profit 501(c)(3) corporations; others operate under a memorandum of understanding with a county, city, and/or local fire protection district; some have no formal structure at all. Fire safe councils vary in focus. Some are county-wide, while others comprise only the Homeowner's Association in a subdivision, to all sizes in between. There are also several regional associations of fire safe councils. While some fire safe councils have paid staff, such as an Executive Director, and may have grant funding for fuel reduction projects, all FSCs rely heavily on volunteers for much of their work. The community-based approach to reducing wildfire risk is being implemented in other locations in the United States. An example is FireSafe Montana. Firewise USA Communities are also community-based organizations focused on wildfire mitigation throughout the US, including California. Evolution  The ‚ÄúFire Safe‚Äù concept The Operation Fire Safe wildfire prevention program was begun in 1968Operation Fire Safe!, State of California Resources Agency, Department of Conservation, Division of Forestry, 1968 by the State of California Resources Agency, Department of Conservation, Division of Forestry, (CDF or CAL FIRE) in response to changing wildfire conditions resulting from more and more homes being built in rural areas that were formerly wildland. (The term ‚ÄúWildland Urban Interface‚Äù,‚ÄúWildland Urban Interface‚Äù or WUI, is used to describe this area.) Next, the Fire Safe! Inside and Out wildfire prevention campaign was developed in 1989 by Loren Poore, Chief of Fire Prevention with CDF.Two Longtime CDFers Retire from Fire Prevention, CDF Communiqu√©, January/February 1994 This program created materials, including a video, a brochure, and other items, to educate homeowners about implementing fire safe practices inside and outside the home. Defensible space began to become the catchword for protecting homes and wildlands in the WUI. At this time, most wildfire safety education was conducted by members of the CDF Volunteers in Prevention (VIP) program.California--The Flammable State, Richard A. Wilson, Director of CDF, CDF Comment, July 1994, retrieved on March 18, 2008 The Oakland firestorm of 1991 provided a new incentive to increase wildfire prevention education and activities, and CDF formed the Fire Safe Advisory Council, AKA the Fire Safe Council, which included insurance industry representatives, wildland firefighting agencies (such as the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)), private industry, and the public. The first fire safe councils In the early 1990s, three organizations were formed that were precursors of what eventually became known as local, community-based Fire Safe Councils: *The Oakhurst Fire Safe Program, located in the central Sierra foothills, was formed as a joint effort by CDF and the US Forest Service, National Park Service, local agencies, community groups, and businesses seeking to formalize a cooperative fire prevention relationship. This program has evolved into the present-day Mariposa County Fire Safe Council. *The Fire Safe Committee of San Mateo County (now Fire Safe San Mateo County) was formed by the local community.200 Years of History Uninterrupted By Progress, Steve Kennedy, The Cannonball Express, retrieved on March 18, 2008 *Fire Safe Marin in Marin County was formed by the local community in 1992 and remains active today.FIRESafe MARIN, 1992-2002, Celebrating the Past, Preparing For the Future, retrieved on March 18, 2008 The 1993 Firestorm in Southern California was another major wildfire event. Residents of the Laguna Beach area formed three committees to deal with the losses as well as to prevent, or at least reduce, future losses.Personal Profile, David Horne, PhD., retrieved on March 18, 2008 These groups evolved into the present-day Greater Laguna Coast Fire Safe Council. CDF support for fire safe councils In support of the community-based efforts, CDF began including these local groups in its Fire Safe Council. The coalition was headed by the CDF Public Education Officer.\\"California‚Äôs I-Zone: Urban Wildland Fire Prevention and Mitigation\\", CDF Office of the State Fire Marshal, 1996 Sometime after 1996, as more and more communities started local Fire Safe Councils throughout the state, the Fire Safe Council became known as the California Fire Safe Council (CFSC). The CFSC was a precursor of the current California Fire Safe Council, Inc. (CFSCI). Through the CFSC, CDF provided assistance to local fire safe councils via monthly meetings where local fire safe councils, and other organizations sharing the fire safe mission, could network; marketing literature such as a brochure; development of videos and Public Service Announcements; a handbook on how to form a Fire Safe Council; and other materials. Marketing support was provided under a contract with the public relations firm Manning Selvage & Lee, which had an office on K Street in Sacramento at the time. This overall support from CDF ceased when the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. was formed as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation in mid-2002. However, most individual CDF/CAL FIRE Units continue to work closely with their local area fire safe councils, often providing \\"in-kind\\" matching funds for grants as well as advice on fire safe projects. The number of fire safe councils expands With active support from CDF and its California Fire Safe Council coalition, more and more communities began forming local Fire Safe Councils. Expansion of the program accelerated after the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County (FSC/NC) received a Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) grant in 1998. One of the conditions of the WUI grant was that the Executive Director of the FSC/NC take an active role in assisting other communities to form Fire Safe Councils, and aid in their success. Now, over 100 local Fire Safe Councils are active in California alone, with more forming all the time. Networking for fire safe councils Prior to the incorporation of the CFSCI, the California Fire Safe Council was the primary means of networking for local FSCs. After incorporation, the CFSCI continued to host the monthly meetings for local FSCs until November 2006, when budget constraints would no longer allow for the expense. Local Fire Safe Council Network Yahoo Group In order to provide a way to keep in touch, in 2006 an electronic group was set up on Yahoo! called the Local Fire Safe Council Network. This group continues to provide a valuable link among local FSCs and other organizations and agencies committed to making California's communities fire safe. Membership in the group can be requested by going to the group's web site and clicking on \\"Join this Group!\\". Prospective members should provide an indication of their affiliation with a local FSC or other organization/agency in their request to join. Funding Federal funding In California Federal funding is administered by the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. (CFSCI) which operates the Fire Safe California Grants Clearinghouse AKA Grants Clearinghouse. Funding is provided to the Grants Clearinghouse by the US Forest Service (USFS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the National Park Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service. (Note that these agencies, notably the USFS, may have other grant funding streams that do not go through the Clearinghouse.) Beginning in 2001, Title II and Title III funds from the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000 (AKA \\"HR 2389\\") were another source of funds for FSCs in Counties that qualify for HR 2389 payments, especially for staff, operations, and education projects, as funds from the Grants Clearinghouse are generally not available for these functions. These funds are paid to Counties, and it was up to the Counties to decide how they are used. In the past, many Counties used at least a portion of the funds for fire safe activities. State funding State funding varies from year to year as programs come and go. Check with your CAL FIRE Unit or County Resource Conservation District or current information. All of the State and Federal funding sources described in this section require matching funds, either in the form of cash or \\"in kind\\", such as labor, materials, vehicles, etc. While not a formal program, most CAL FIRE units provide financial assistance to their local fire safe councils in the form of \\"in kind\\" matching funds for grants. Other funding sources Other sources of funds for fire safe councils are donations from the community, membership dues, grants from sources other than listed here, and funding from their County and/or City government. In addition, a percentage for administration is usually a component of any grants received, although these funds are restricted in that they can only be used an activities associated with the particular grant and must be accounted for to the funding agency. Examples of fire safe council accomplishments This section is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give a few examples of what has been accomplished by fire safe councils over the years. Most of these projects were funded by grants. Special needs assistance Many fire safe councils operate a program that assists people with special needs, such as seniors, low-income, and disabled persons, to create and maintain the defensible space around their home. Some examples are: *El Dorado County Fire Safe Council Senior Assistance *Plumas County Fire Safe Council Senior & Disabled Assistance Program *Fire Safe Council of Nevada County Special Needs Assistance Program Free chipper program One difficulty homeowners have with creating and maintaining defensible space is what to do with the vegetation once it is removed. To help with this, many fire safe councils provide free access to a chipper. An example is the Kern River Valley Fire Safe Council Chipper Days. Defensible space inspection/education program The purpose of these programs is to educate homeowners as to what they need to do to create adequate defensible space and sometimes also give suggestions about modifications to make to the home itself to make it more resistant to wildfire. These are also called \\"dooryard visits\\" by some fire safe councils. These volunteers are trained by their local CAL FIRE Unit or their local Fire Protection District. For example, the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County has a Defensible Space Advisory Visit service. Fuel breaks While defensible space protects homes from wildfire, firebreaks, also called fuel breaks, protect communities. These may also be referred to as \\"shaded fuel breaks\\". Fuel breaks are usually linear. The US Forest Service also uses the Strategically Placed Area Treatment (SPLAT) concept. SPLATs may be any shape. Many fuel breaks have been created by fire safe councils, using grant funding. One example is the Eastern Madera County Fire Safe Council Crooks Mountain Fuel Break. Community wildfire protection plans The Federal funding sources described in the section on Funding either require that projects be part of an approved Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP), or give preference to such projects. In response, many FSCs have taken a proactive role in getting these plans developed and approved, even though this responsibility really resides with local government. A sampling of other projects *The Greater Laguna Coast Fire Safe Council Red Flag Program is designed to complement the official steps taken by the fire fighting professionals with the goal of providing a highly visible reminder to all citizens in the region to be extra careful and vigilant on the days when the Santa Ana winds blow. *The Fire Safe Council of Nevada County has published the Fire Wise Plants for Western Nevada County, which is distributed by a local nursery, among other places. The nursery reported a significant shift in the mix of plants people purchase. *A helpful tool for homeowners is a list of local contractors who do fuel reduction work. The Fire Safe Council of Nevada County maintains a list of contractors by category, and the El Dorado County Fire Safe Council has a Fuels Reduction Contractors List. *At the request of the Butte County Fire Safe Council, California State Assemblyman Rick Keene authored legislation (AB 1883) to streamline the process by which local Fire Safe Councils may contract with CAL FIRE to have inmate fire crews implement fuel reduction projects. This bill became law on August 4, 2008. Recognition of fire safe councils Many fire safe councils, as well as individual contributors, have received recognition for their efforts to improve the ability for California‚Äôs communities to survive wildfire. Since it is impossible to list all of these, the following examples are offered in honor of all who have contributed to this important effort. National recognition *In 2001, the Bronze Smokey Award was presented to the Fire Safe Council of Nevada County by the US Forest Service for providing outstanding public service in wildfire prevention. The Bronze Smokey is the highest National honor given for community-based fire prevention work. *In 2002, the Yuba Watershed Protection and Fire Safe Council received a Bronze Smokey from the USFS *In 2003, Idyllwild's Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council received a national award from the USFS in recognition of its contributions to the community over the past year. *In 2004, Plumas County Fire Safe Council was recognized by the US Forest Service Chief with the Rural Community Assistance National Leadership Award for, ‚ÄúOutstanding accomplishments through their exceptional leadership, vision, and perseverance in working collaboratively to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire in Plumas County‚Äù. *In 2005, Luana Dowling, Fire Chief for Iowa Hill and Chair of the Foresthill/Iowa Hill Fire Safe Council, received recognition from the US Forest Service for her success in obtaining funding for, and then implementing, various fuel reduction projects on USFS and BLM land near Foresthill and Iowa Hill. Numerous national recognition has been awarded since 2005. State recognition *In 2000, Laura Dyberg, President of the Mountain Rim Fire Safe Council in Southern California, was named Woman of the Year for the 31st Senate District of California by Senator Jim Brulte *in 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger included fire safe councils in his Executive Order S-07-07 as one of the resources available to CAL FIRE ‚Äúto support a heightened level of fire prevention public awareness and education‚Äù *In 2008, the California Legislature enacted a joint resolution, SCR 80 (Cogdill) recognizing that ‚Äúlocal Fire Safe Councils work to educate communities, provide wildfire safety planning, fire prevention, and educational programs throughout the state and remain a critical component of statewide fire protection efforts.‚Äù Local recognition * In 2003, Fire Safe Marin received the Regional Excellence Award from the Board of Supervisors for its work to support fire agencies across Marin County in protecting life, property and the environment for the citizens of Marin. *On October 19, 2004, Robin Yonash, Founder of the Greater Colfax Area Fire Safe Council, received a commendation from the Placer County Board of Supervisors (Resolution 2004-163) for promoting fire safety throughout Placer County. *In 2006, the Fallbrook Fire Safe Council was honored as the Fire Safe Council of the Year for San Diego County for ‚Äúits extraordinary efforts to improve fire safety in the community‚Äù by the North County Fire Protection District (NCFPD). *In 2006, Blair Ceniceros received a plaque from Riverside County commemorating his tenure as President of the Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council. Ceniceros began his leadership as president of the MCFSC in 2003 and stepped down in May, 2006 but remained on the Board. *On October 18, 2006, the third anniversary of the Cedar Fire entry into the City of San Diego, Jerry Mitchell, Director of the Scripps Ranch Fire Safe Council, was presented the Channel 10 (KGTV) Leadership Award for starting the fire safe council in October 2003. Mr. Mitchell also received the Fire Safe Council of San Diego County Volunteer of the Year Award and a United States Senate Certificate of Appreciation. *In 2007, The Greater Auburn Area Fire Safe Council was awarded the Citizen Outstanding Service Award by the Placer County Fire Chief's Association. The citizen-lead Greater Auburn Area Fire Safe Council was recognized for working hand-in-hand with local and state fire agencies in Auburn, Newcastle and Penryn, in identifying ways to educate residents on protecting their families and homes from wildfire. *In 2007, Janice Fast, a longtime member, staunch supporter and volunteer of the Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council was awarded the Mountain Communities Fire Safe Council's first \\"Citizen of the Year\\" award. There have been numerous other awards and recognition since 2007. California community-based fire safe councils For a list of current fire safe councils in California see the \\"Fire Safe Councils\\" link on the California Fire Safe Council site. Relationship with the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. As described earlier in this article, initially fire safe councils throughout the state, with support from CDF staff and other organizations that shared the fire safe mission, comprised the California Fire Safe Council (CFSC). However, with the incorporation of the California Fire Safe Council, Inc. (CFSCI) in mid-2002, the old inclusive CFSC disappeared and was replaced by a non-membership 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. The CFSCI Board of Directors and its staff comprise the CFSCI. Local fire safe councils are no longer members and have minimal impact on, or knowledge of, decisions made by the CFSCI. The CFSCI is simply one more entity among the over 100 independent organizations that focus on wildfire safety throughout the state of California. It has a somewhat different function from local FSCs in that its primary role is to administer the Grants Clearinghouse. The California Fire Safe Council, Inc. bylaws do not allow for direct participation by local fire safe councils. Thus, the primary of information about the activities and decisions of the CFSCI is to attend the public portion of its quarterly Board of Directors meetings. In general, this is not feasible for local FSCs due to the travel involved, so they must depend on the meeting minutes. As of May 2018, the CFSCI does not make it easy to find out about upcoming Board meetings or minutes for past meetings as there are no direct links on the CFSCI web site. A Google search had to be done to find the links given here. Firewise USA Like fire safe councils, the Firewise USA program is designed to reach beyond the fire service by involving homeowners, community leaders, planners, developers, and others in the effort to protect people, property, and natural resources from the risk of wildland fire - before a fire starts. Fire safe councils and Firewise USA both emphasize community responsibility for planning in the design of a safe community as well as effective emergency response, and individual responsibility for safer home construction and design, landscaping, and maintenance. The Firewise USA program is intended to serve as a resource for agencies, tribes, organizations, fire departments, and communities across the U.S. who are working toward a common goal: reduce loss of lives, property, and resources to wildland fire by building and maintaining communities in a way that is compatible with our natural surroundings. It differs from fire safe councils in that the Firewise program is nationwide while fire safe councils are mainly in California. The two approaches to motivating community members to take responsibility for preparing their communities to be better able to survive a wildfire are very compatible. The major difference between the two methods is that in order to be certified by Firewise USA, the entire community must be involved, including financially, whereas fire safe councils, especially those that are 501(c)(3) organizations, can operate with a much smaller level of individual participation. Also, fire safe councils often implement projects which go beyond a single community, such as shaded fuel breaks. The Firewise USA communities in California are often chapters of a county-wide fire safe council, but they also function independently if that best serves the community. Firewise USA offers a wide range of resources including printed materials as well as courses.

The most famous illuminated manuscript associated with the town, the 5th-century Quedlinburg Itala fragment, once in the church, had been moved to a museum in Berlin and was not stolen. The missing artifacts started resurfacing in 1987. After various lawsuits against and negotiations with the heirs of the by-then deceased Meador, they were restored to their rightful owners. William Honan, an author and journalist working for The New York Times, published in 1997 an account of the theft and how he traced it to the Meador family. Theft Quedlinburg Abbey was founded as a proprietary church of the Ottonian Imperial family by Emperor Otto the Great in 936, as a memorial to his father. Over the following centuries, it accumulated a rich collection of treasures donated by the Imperial family. At the Protestant Reformation, it was converted into the Lutheran Church of St. Servatius. During World War II, the treasure was moved for security to a mineshaft southwest of the town. On April 19, 1945, the cache was found by a unit of the advancing U.S. Army, the 87th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, and placed under guard. In June, church authorities complained that eight precious objects were missing. However, investigations proved futile and the matter was dropped in 1949 because, by then, Quedlinburg was part of East Germany. First Lieutenant Meador was a member of the 87th. Before the war, in 1938, Meador had received a bachelor's degree from North Texas State University, majoring in art, so he would have had a better appreciation than most of the value of the find. Several of his fellow soldiers reported seeing him entering the mine and leaving with bundles. Letters he wrote to his family indicate he mailed at least several of the objects home to Whitewright, Texas. Sale and lawsuits Although Meador occasionally showed the art to his co- workers, he made no attempt to sell it. Upon his death from cancer on February 1, 1980, his will made no mention of the artwork. Jane Meador Cook and Jack Meador, Joe's sister and brother, sold the Samuhel Gospel to the Cultural Foundation of the States, an organization based in Berlin and dedicated to repatriating lost German art, for $3 million. The transaction was finalized on May 9, 1990. However, news of the sale resulted in a civil lawsuit brought in U.S. District Court on behalf of the Quedlinburg church on June 18, 1990. Negotiations led to an agreement that the Meador family would be paid either $2.75 million (less the 1990 payments) or $1 million for the return of all the artifacts. The U.S. government chose to press charges. On January 4, 1996, Jack Meador, Jane Cook, and their lawyer, John Torigian, were indicted for \\"conspiring to receive, possess, conceal, store, barter, sell and dispose of stolen goods and for receiving, possessing, concealing, storing, bartering, selling and disposing of stolen goods.\\"William H. Honan (October 30, 2003). \\"Jack and Jane Meador, Figures in Stolen Wartime Art Case\\". New York Times. Retrieved 2008-09-07. However, on October 22, 1996, the charges were dismissed by the District Court because they had been brought too late under the statute of limitations. Afterward, the Internal Revenue Service investigated and sought over $50 million in taxes, penalties, and interest. On April 20, 2000, the IRS and the Meador family settled for $135,000.

Early life In this 1945 newspaper report, Minister of Defense (\\"Menteri Pertahanan\\") is listed as \\"not yet appointed\\" (\\"beloem diangkat\\"). This is due to uncertainties about Supriyadi's fate. Supriyadi was born in what is now Trenggalek, Dutch East Indies, on 13 April 1923. He attended junior high school, then a school to prepare him for government bureaucracy in Magelang. However, the Japanese invaded Indonesia before he graduated. He then switched to high school and underwent youth training (Seimendoyo) in Tangerang, West Java.Sudarmanto (1996), pp. 231-232 Involvement with PETA In October 1943, the Japanese established a militia, PETA () to assist Japanese forces against the Allies. Supriyadi joined PETA, and after training was posted to Blitar. He was tasked with overseeing the work of the Romusha forced laborers. The plight of these workers inspired him to rebel against the Japanese. When Supriyadi join with PETA, he was given the rank of shodancho or platoon commander. The Blitar rebellion When nationalist leader Sukarno visited his parents in Blitar, PETA officers told him that they had begun to plan a rebellion and asked for Sukarno's opinion. He told them to consider the consequences, but Supriyadi, leader of the rebels, was convinced the uprising would succeed. In the early hours of 14 February 1945, rebels attacked Japanese troops, causing heavy casualties. However, the Japanese defeated the rebellion and put the ringleaders on trial. Six (or eightRicklefs (1982) p 196) people were sentenced to death and the rest were given jail sentences ranging from three years to life. However, Supriyadi reportedly was not executed. Some said Supriyadi escaped and hid from the Japanese.Mutiara (1999), p 90 He was not seen again after the failure of the rebellion.Cribb (2008), p 93 Disappearance On 19 August 1945, in a government decree issued by the newly independent Indonesia, Supriyadi was named Minister for Public Security in the Presidential Cabinet. However, he failed to appear, and was replaced on 20 October by acting minister Muhammad Soeljoadikusuma. To this day his fate remains unknown.Simanjuntak (2003), p18 If he was alive during his appointment and took the office, he would have been aged 22 and became the youngest ever minister in the nation's history. He was officially declared a National Hero on 9 August 1975, thus legally declaring him dead as the National Hero title is only given posthumously.

Photo by Arthur De Wint Foote. Arthur De Wint Foote (1849-1933) was an American civil engineer and mining engineer who impacted the development of the American West with his innovative engineering works and entrepreneurial ventures. In Northern California in the late 1890s, he designed and built the North Star Mine Powerhouse, the highest capacity impulse-turbine power-plant of the time, and now a California historic landmark; within that plant he designed and installed the then-largest Pelton wheel turbine. Later, he designed and built Foote's Crossing, a high bridge, and Foote's Crossing Road, both now memorialized as California and U.S. landmarks. Early years Born in Guilford, Connecticut, Foote's ancestry was English‚Äîfrom Yorkshire before 1630. After preparatory schooling as a youth, he attended Yale College's Sheffield Scientific School, but left in 1868 before graduating. From there he began his early career in business and construction ventures along the eastern seaboard of the US and in the West Indies basin. Career Immersing himself in learning the civil engineering practicum, with application in mining operations, young Arthur Foote became an exemplar of the motto \\"Go West, young man\\"; he aspired to making his career and fortune in the 'new' West, first in California. In 1873, he landed in San Francisco, seeking work. In quick succession he worked on the Sutro Tunnel site in Virginia City, Nevada‚Äîwhere he assisted with installing the first industrial air compressor in a tunnel or mine in the U.S. West; then on the Eldorado Canal of the American River, which supplied water to new hydraulic mines near Placerville, California. Working for the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1874, he assisted the chief engineer building the Tehachapi Loop, the celebrated climbing railway spiral‚Äîand now a popular railfan site and National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.Rickard, pp. 172-173 In 1876, while posted at the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine in Santa Clara County, California, young Foote returned East to marry and to bring his bride, Mary Hallock Foote, back to California. Soon he moved his family to Deadwood, South Dakota, where he helped supervise the Homestake Mine; then to Leadville, Colorado, during the Colorado Silver Boom. There he served as a (litigation) mining expert for the Iron Silver Mining Company. Later he supervised the Adelaide Mine and other small mines near Leadville.Rickard, pp. 174 Abandoning the high altitudes for health reasons, Foote journeyed to Morelia in Michoac√°n, Mexico, to prospect a retired silver mine; then to Wood River Valley in south-central Idaho‚Äîlocale of today's Sun Valley ski resort‚Äîto open the Wolftone Mine prospect. Later, he formed a partnership venture and bought water rights on the Boise River where he designed the Boise River irrigation project, then developed it for ten years before it eventually failed for lack of capital. The project became known as the New York Canal. (Ultimately it was completed by the federal government, i.e., the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, as the Arrowrock Dam project (1915), then the largest arid- lands irrigation scheme in the United States.) Foote's Idaho home was built of lava rock and used his own cement formula; the site () is near the outlet of the Lucky Peak Dam After Boise, Foote served as a hydrologist for the newly created U.S. Geological Survey, leading field surveys that documented the hydrology and hydraulics of reaches of the Snake River and Snake River Plain and valley. He returned briefly to Mexico to engineer roads in Baja California for an onyx mine; then 'made home' again to California to manage the Fremont Mine in Amador City, just east of Sacramento.Rickard, pp. 176-177 Grass Valley, California In 1895, Foote settled his family in Grass Valley, California‚Äîsome west of Lake Tahoe‚Äîwhere he was hired to design an electric- generating plant for the North Star Mine, the second largest gold producing mine in California. After studying the site he judged that electric power was neither safe nor dependable for operating the underground works there; instead he conceived a master plan for using air compressors to operate the mine‚Äîand using hydro-impulse turbines to power the compressors. Now he envisioned a power plant housing an over-sized Pelton water wheel‚Äîthe recently invented hydro-powered impulse turbine. At in diameter, he designed and erected a drum wheel more than sixty per cent larger than the maximum recommended by the Pelton Water Wheel Company in San Francisco. Upon completion, 'Foote's Pelton wheel' performed successfully as the world's largest operating impulse turbine wheel; it was in continuous use for over 30 years. In 1991, Foote's North Star Mine Powerhouse was designated an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.Rickard, pp. 178-179 Foote advanced to superintendent and later to general manager of the North Star Mine. Then he and his wife commissioned the design of North Star House by the architect Julia Morgan. The grand residence was built in 1905 in Grass Valley. Also known as Foote Mansion, the house is notable for its iconic 'western' elegance, and for its association with the careers of three singular 'westerners': the engineer- miner-entrepreneur Arthur Foote, his wife the author-illustrator Mary Hallock Foote, and the master architect Morgan. Later, the author Wallace Stegner made Foote Mansion the setting for his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Angle of Repose (1972), which closely referenced the lives of the Footes. Members of the Foote family occupied the North Star House as home until 1968. The House is listed on national and state registers of historic places; and the landscape-site, including gardens and orchard, has been designated as a local historic landmark. While at North Star Mine in 1911, Foote and several partners purchased the Tightner Mine in Alleghany, California. Now Foote designed and constructed a high bridge over the Middle Yuba River and a high grade mountain road connecting the two mines.Brower, p. 42-43 Subsequently, the project ‚Äî consisting of the Foote's Crossing Road and the Foote's Crossing Road high bridge ‚Äî was memorialized as a National Register of Historic Places landmark and as a California Point of Historical Interest(No. P401). Mary Hallock Foote Arthur and Mary Foote served ambassadorial roles of representing the 'new' West and the lifestyles to be had there. They frequently received dignitaries and celebrities touring the West and hosted them for extended stays at North Star House; they hosted community and civic events there. He contributed technical papers to professional societies and published scholarly articles addressing public issues, especially re developing the West. He advocated high standards of literacy, both professional and personal, for engineers.Rickard, pp. 184-189 Personal life and controversy In 1876, Foote married the illustrator and writer Mary Hallock Foote (1847-1938) in her hometown of Milton, Ulster County, New York. Their marriage produced a son, who followed closely after his father's career footsteps, and two daughters, Betty and Agnes Arthur Foote's biography was written by his wife within her memoirs‚Äîwhich were collected by Rodman Paul and published in 1972 as A Victorian Gentlewoman in the Far West. Mary Hallock Foote, in her own right, was an important literary and pioneer figure in the history of the old West. In creating his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Angle of Repose(1972), the twentieth century novelist Wallace Stegner appropriated‚Äîwith permission‚Äîportions of Arthur and Mary Foote's life stories from her memoirs (noted above). Stegner used passages taken directly from Mary Foote's actual letters and recast them as fictionalized correspondence of the novel's main character; his choices resulted in controversy within the literary community that continues today.

Wrestlicious (2009‚Äì2010) In 2009, Von Erich began working for the all-female wrestling promotion Wrestlicious, which was created by Jimmy Hart and started airing in March 2010. She, however, had to be released by the company after the tapings of the first season of episodes, after signing with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). She debuted on March 17 episode of Takedown in a tag team main event, where she and Amber Lively defeated Draculetta and White Magic by disqualification. On the April 7 episode of Takedown, Von Erich participated in a battle royal to determine the top two contenders for the Wrestlicious Crown, but was eliminated by Kickstart Katie. On the May 19 episode of Takedown, Von Erich helped Alexandra the Great in her submission match against Kickstart Katie. She ended up putting Brooke Lynne in the Von Erich Claw to make her drop her towel and give Alexandra the victory over Katie. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling =The Beautiful People (2009‚Äì2010)= On the October 1, 2009, episode of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA)'s Impact!, Von Erich debuted as a villainous character by aligning herself with The Beautiful People (Velvet Sky and Madison Rayne) and attacking the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions, Taylor Wilde, and Sarita. On the October 15 episode of Impact!, she made her in-ring debut teaming with Sky and Rayne in a six-Knockout tag team match, where they defeated the team of Awesome Kong, ODB, and Tara. Two weeks later on Impact!, she once again teamed with Sky and Rayne in a six-Knockouts tag team match, where they defeated ODB, Christy Hemme, and Hamada, when Von Erich pinned Hemme, scoring her first victory in TNA. On November 5, Von Erich began carrying a pink nightstick with her to the ring, which was dubbed \\"Lacey's Ugly Stick\\". At Turning Point, the Beautiful People were unsuccessful in gaining both the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship and the TNA Knockouts Championship, as ODB pinned Rayne in a six- way tag team match with all the titles on the line to win the match for the reigning champions. The Beautiful People began appearing in backstage segments they dubbed as their reality show \\"The Meanest Girls\\", an allusion to the 2004 teen comedy Mean Girls. On the December 10 episode of Impact!, Von Erich was defeated by Velvet Sky in a mud wrestling match refereed by Madison Rayne. The match was booked by Kevin Nash, who was in charge for the evening, in an attempt to garner ratings. On December 17 episode of Impact!, Von Erich had a backstage confrontation with interviewer Lauren Brooke, which ended with Brooke slapping Von Erich. The following week, Von Erich claimed that she had gotten Brooke fired from TNA. Von Erich (center) as part of The Beautiful People, along with Madison Rayne (left) and Velvet Sky (right) as the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions On the January 14, 2010, episode of Impact!, Sky, Rayne, and Von Erich were attacked by the returning Angelina Love, whom Von Erich had replaced in the Beautiful People. On the March 8 episode of Impact!, Rayne and Sky defeated the teams of Love and Tara and Sarita and Taylor Wilde in a three-way match to win the vacant TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, which they defended with Von Erich under the Freebird rule. Von Erich's first title defense was on the April 19 episode of Impact!, where she teamed with Velvet Sky to defeat the team of Daffney and ODB. On the May 8 episode of Impact!, Von Erich, Sky, and Rayne successfully defended their titles against Sarita, Taylor Wilde, and Tara. On the May 17 episode of Impact!, Von Erich and Sky successfully defended their titles against Sarita and Taylor Wilde. On the June 17 episode of Impact!, Von Erich competed in her second singles match in TNA against Angelina Love, who was making a return from an injury, and won by disqualification after she was dropped on a steel chair with a DDT. Von Erich and Velvet Sky in July 2010 On July 11 at Victory Road, Madison Rayne lost her TNA Knockouts Championship to Angelina Love by disqualification, due to outside interference from a person disguised with a motorcycle helmet. Prior to the match, it was announced that the title would change hands via disqualification, if either Velvet Sky or Lacey Von Erich interfered in the match. On the following episode of Impact!, The Beautiful People imploded, as Sky said she didn't approve of Rayne's recent attitude, behavior, and apparent affiliation with the mystery woman at the pay-per-view, to which Rayne responded by saying that she didn't need Sky anymore. Sky and Von Erich then walked out on Rayne, as she and the mystery woman ganged up on Love. On the July 22 episode of Impact!, the Knockouts Championship was returned to Rayne, when it was declared that there was no proof that the person who had interfered in the match was either Sky or Von Erich. Later that same night, Rayne convinced Von Erich to abandon Sky and leave with her and the mystery woman. On the August 5 episode of Impact!, Von Erich and Sky lost the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Hamada and Taylor Wilde, when Rayne's and the mystery woman's interference backfired. Later that night, Sky and Rayne were seen fighting backstage, during which Sky shoved Von Erich, who tried to make peace between her teammates, inadvertently knocking her unconscious. The following week, it was announced that Von Erich had suffered a broken cheek bone in the altercation. Von Erich returned from injury on the September 16 episode of Impact!, teaming with Madison Rayne against Wilde and Hamada for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. Von Erich and Rayne were unsuccessful in regaining the championships, after which Von Erich was attacked by Rayne and Tara, before being saved by Velvet Sky and Angelina Love, thus turning Von Erich into a fan favorite. On the September 23 episode of Impact!, Von Erich teamed with Sky against Wilde and Hamada for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful in regaining the championships, after Rayne hit Von Erich with the motorcycle helmet. On the October 14 episode of Impact!, Von Erich appeared in an in-ring segment with Love, Sky and Jersey Shore cast member and guest star Jennifer \\"JWoww\\" Farley, where they attacked Cookie and Robbie E. On the October 28 episode of Impact!, it was announced that Von Erich had agreed to train Miss Tessmacher to wrestle, after her stable mates had turned her down the previous week. However, on November 11, 2010, the angle ended abruptly when Adkisson announced her departure from TNA. Other media On January 25, 2010, Adkisson was a guest on the weekly \\"Right After Wrestling\\" radio program on Hardcore Sports Radio on SIRIUS Radio Channel 98 with host Arda Ocal. In November 2010, she was a contestant on an all TNA week of Family Feud, teaming with Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Tara and Velvet Sky against Jay Lethal, Matt Morgan, Mick Foley, Mr. Anderson and Rob Van Dam. From 2008-2010, Adkisson was a regular contributor to the wrestling podcast, False Count Radio. Personal life Adkisson is part of the famed Von Erich family. Her grandfather was Fritz Von Erich, and she is the daughter of Kerry Von Erich. She has an older sister named Hollie. She has two sons; Daniel and a son named Tripp born on August 30, 2012. In 2016, she gave birth to her first daughter, Barbara. Adkisson runs her own advertising company in Southern California. In early 2009, she was diagnosed with meningitis after complaining of a migraine, but made a full recovery.

Although Alderney is only five kilometers long, it has a geological history spanning half of the life of the earth. It is part of the Armorican Massif. Geological history Relics of sediments appear as xenoliths in granites. However the earliest dated rock is the grey coloured Western Granodiorite from in the Paleoproterozoic. As its name suggests it is found in the west end of Alderney. The xenoliths in it are dark ellipses that demonstrate that the rock has been squashed. This granite in turn was intruded by the Telegraph Bay Granite in the southernmost part of the island. This granite contains 50 mm feldspar crystals. Aplite veins continued from the same magma. The final stage of intrusion was a microgranite forming many dykes. Feldspar in the pink microgranite is only 2 mm big. The next stage of geological history was the intrusion of the Central Diorite Complex that makes up the north and centre of the island. This belongs to the Cadomian Orogeny time at . Embedded in the diorite are a couple of large gabbro inclusions, as well as a picrite on the east of Braye Bay. Some of the diorite has orbicular structure, concentric spheres of plagioclase and hornblende rich zones form balls up to 20 cm in diameter. A pale coloured granite intruded on the north: the Bibette Head Granite. This contains many xenoliths. Sodium rich dykes then were intruded. In the next stage the terrane was uplifted, and eroded. Fine grained sand that formed quartzite was deposited. Further weathering ensued, with most of this deposit removed and laterite formed. Next a stream channel formed over the land, dumping coarse sand with feldspar. This formed a pink sandstone. The flow came from the northwest, with particles derived from granite and gneiss. initially this filled in the hollows in the underlying granites, but soon overflowed into a braided channel. Flood plain conditions caused layers of silt to form between the sand. These sediments deposited in the Cambrian are probably the final stage of the Cadomian Orogeny. In the Variscan Orogeny folding and faulting affected all the rocks. Dolerite (or diabase) and lamprophyre dykes intruded. These are probably from the Carboniferous period. In the Pleistocene varying sea levels caused raised beaches to form 8, 18 and 30 meters above the current sea level. As in Jersey, loess blew in as dust from the bare ground in the near glacial conditions in the ice ages. Head also formed in the periglacial circumstances by breaking off rock fragments and mixing with dirt.

The War of the Bands (, ) was a civil war, really an extended series of blood feuds, in the western Basque Country, Gascony, and Navarre in the Late Middle Ages. The main primary source for the War is Las Bienandan√ßas e fortunas by Lope Garc√≠a de Salazar, written c.1471. The war is named after the aristocratic networks of familial alliances and their armed followings, known as bandos (bands), that carried out constant wars for power and honour across three kingdoms. The wars ceased only with the imposition of royal authority under Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, the Catholic Monarchs. The wars resulted partly from the destabilising effect of the Castilian Civil War and the ensuing political weakness of the House of Trast√°mara. That the Seniory of Biscay effectively ceased to exist after 1370 and was subsumed in 1379 into Castile only exacerbated the effects of political anarchy on Biscay. The rise of the towns, notably Bilbao and Bermeo, caused jockeying for municipal power between the rich urban families. The landed nobility, enfeoffed in the heavily encastellated countryside, nursed feuds that dated back centuries. The Legizamon and Zamudiano had been enemies since 1270. Many minor noble families were caught in the feuds of the great families by ties of marriage. In 1362, in the early stage of the conflicts, the Legizamon and Zurbar√°n families fought a battle in the streets of Bilbao. They battled again in the market of Bermeo in 1413. Thereafter until 1433 the fighting between the two bands continued without a truce. The Basurto, who had been enemies of the Legizamon over the rights to a salmon, fought on the side of the Zurbar√°n. The urban warfare was less fatal than the pitched battles often fought in the countryside: only five men died in a fracas in Bilbao in 1440 and only ten in the streets of Bermeo in 1443. In 1413 a private war broke out between Juan de Sant Pedro, from the Labourd in the English Duchy of Gascony, and the Navarrese houses of the Espeleta and the Alzate. After the head of the Alzate and his son were killed, Lord Fernando of the Gamboa family of Gipuzkoa married his son to the daughter and heiress of the Alzate. In consequence he led an attack on Juan de Sant Pedro to avenge his daughter-in-law's family. He was defeated and killed and 150 men died in the battle. Around 1420 the Gamboinos extended their feuding with an assault by night on the O√±az family, also of Guip√∫zcoa. On Christmas, the O√±az' manor was set alight and the head of the house plus nine others died in the blaze. The O√±az family lands were then ravaged by the Gamboinos and their allies, but the allies of the O√±az came to their defence. Of the latter, the Lezcano attacked the Gamboino-allied Balda family and killed its leader. With the end of this little war a whole new network of blood feuds had come into being. The Gamboinos and the Balda fought against the O√±az and the Lezcano at Zumarraga in 1446. The O√±az were victorious and burnt the Gamboino fortress at Azkoitia. Seventy men and twelve of the leaders were killed. The families, with every wider networks of allies, engaged again in 1447 and 1448. As early as 1390 and 1393 warring in Biscay had been reduced by the intervention of the royalist hermandades, capable of drawing on the revenues of royal estates. In 1415 the corregidor, the royally- appointed governor of the hermandad, acting on royal orders, siphoned off Biscayan wheat to the Asturias, inciting a rebellion. The Biscayans were defeated at Erandio with the loss of sixty men and the wheat transfers continued. In 1442 the hermandades interfered successfully in Bilbao and Mondrag√≥n, but the peace established did not endure. In 1457 the war between the Gamboinos and the O√±az was brought to an abrupt end when the hermandades rebelled against them both, seized their manors, and expelled their leaders from Guip√∫zcoa.

History The relative position of Inamuragasaki and of the Passes attacked by Nitta YoshisadaBecause the ancient T≈çkaid≈ç highway passed along the sea south of this cape before heading to the Miura Peninsula, before the opening of the Gokuraku Pass Inamuragasaki was the traditional point of entry to Kamakura at the time of the Kamakura shogunate. Now crossed by a road (see photo), it used to be impassable by land and was therefore one of the natural defenses that made Kamakura an impregnable fortress. For this reason, it appears often in the historical record. It is first mentioned in the Genpei J≈çsuiki because the Miura clan in 1180 crossed it twice to go rescue Minamoto no Yoritomo at the battle of Ishibashiyama. The troops didn't arrive in time, Yoritomo was defeated and the Miura had to go back the way they had come. The cape then appears in the because its author in 1223 passed it to enter Kamakura.

The Taiheiki version of the events  According to the Taiheiki, on the night before the attack Nitta watched from the top of a hill the enemy camp and its defenses closing the Gokuraku Pass, then the beach, blocked by heavy fortifications. He knew that the sea was guarded by hundreds of enemy ships. Looking at nearby Inamuragasaki, he threw his sword into the surf, prayed to Ry≈´jinIn describing this event, Japanese sources say Nitta Yoshisada prayed to a sea-god or Ry≈´jin, English sources almost always refer to Sun Goddess Amaterasu. The Taiheiki itself (Á®≤ÊùëÂ¥éÊàêÂπ≤ÊΩü‰∫ã) says (in Japanese): > Dismounting from his horse, Yoshisada removed his helmet and prostrating > himself across the distant seas prayed to Ry≈´jin. \\"It is said that the lord > of Japan from the beginning, Amaterasu ≈åmikami, enshrined at Ise Jing≈´, hid > herself within a Vairocana and appeared as Ry≈´jin of the vast blue seas.

Bypassing the cape on foot would be impossible today even at an extraordinarily low tide and its base is always entirely under water but, according to old texts, sea level there was lower a thousand years ago and a narrow strip of land regularly appeared at low tide. The Azuma Kagami states that, on September 21, 1181, sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoritomo went to Inamuragasaki because of an archery contest that was going to take place on its beach.Mutsu (1995:247) Recent scientific surveys in situ, taken into account present tide levels and estimated tide levels in 1333, confirm that Nitta's army could have entered Kamakura through Inamuragasaki exploiting a low tide. Since Nitta had spent a long time in Kamakura as a vassal of the H≈çj≈ç, he could have been familiar enough with its tides to be conceivably able to take advantage of them.

It is one of the largest and most important squares on the left bank of the Seine. The square is named after Pierre Denfert-Rochereau, the French commander who organized the defense at the siege of Belfort during the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871). It is dominated by the Lion of Belfort statue (a smaller version of the original in the town of Belfort) by Fr√©d√©ric Bartholdi. The square is the location of the Paris Catacombs museum. It is frequently the place where demonstrations and protest marches in Paris either start or end. The square is also the place depicted on the backdrop at the beginning of the third act of La Boh√®me by Puccini. History This \\"place\\" owes its original official recognition to letters patent dated 9 August 1760, which applied to the part of the site that was located inside the old Wall of the Farmers-General, i.e., the northeastern portion of the present Place Denfert-Rochereau. (The Wall of the Farmers-General, built under the ancien r√©gime to prevent the evasion of excise taxes, separated Paris from the suburb of Montrouge.) An ordinance of the Bureau of Finances, dated 16 January 1789, recognized the southwestern portion of the \\"place\\", the part outside the wall, as part of Paris. The opening in the wall itself, which permitted entry or exit from Paris, was commonly called the Barri√®re d‚ÄôEnfer. It is mentioned in Les Mis√©rables by Victor Hugo: :\\"How did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from some guardhouse which stood ajar; perhaps in the vicinity, at the barri√®re d'Enfer, or on the esplanade de l'Observatoire, or in the neighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment on which could be read: invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum [\\"they discovered the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes\\"], there was some mountebank's booth from which they had fled [‚Ä¶].\\" Here, astride the opening in the wall, the architect Claude Nicolas Ledoux constructed two tollhouses to be used for the collection of the octroi, a local tariff levied on products entering Paris. At the center of the present square, these two pavilions once framed the opening in the wall, and now, oddly, the entrance to the underworld of the catacombs lies next to the western one of them, the pavilion at the barri√®re d'Enfer (\\"barrier of Hell\\"). Former name Traditionally called by the rather unattractive name of Place d‚ÄôEnfer (Place of Hell), the square had the name of Denfert-Rochereau ascribed to it through a sort of \\"municipal pun\\". The Franco-Prussian War had demoralized the French populace, and there was widespread damage all over northeastern France and to Paris itself. Anxious to put a positive spin on the defeat, the French authorities were looking for heroes to glorify. (At this time, for example, the village of Bitche, located near the German border on the Orne, had a Parisian square named for it because it had put up a spirited defense against the Prussians.) Denfert-Rochereau was a courageous man and an authentic hero, but whether his grandiose nickname, \\"The Lion of Belfort\\", was deserved is a matter of some debate. Nonetheless, since \\"Denfert\\" (of Denfert- Rochereau) is pronounced exactly the same as \\"d'Enfer\\" (of Place d'Enfer), this coincidence was too perfect for the mairie (city hall) to ignore. They renamed the square Place Denfert-Rochereau, and they could plausibly deny that they were ignoring Paris's ancient traditions in so doing. The name has remained Place Denfert-Rochereau ever since. Places of interest Jean Boucher The main square, Place Denfert-Rochereau, is planted with trees, mostly horse chestnuts, maples, and locusts, and there are three named green spaces within it as well: Square Abb√© Migne, Square Jacques Antoine, and Square Claude Nicolas Ledoux. At the center of the square, in the midst of the traffic circulation, is a one-third-scale replica of the Lion of Belfort statue by Bartholdi, symbolizing the courage of the resistance raised by Colonel Denfert-Rochereau at Belfort. In the garden to one side is a monument by Jean Boucher commemorating Ludovic Trarieux. The tax-collection pavilion of the Enfer barrier. The entrance to the catacombs is behind the double-gate on the left. The section of the main north-south boulevard running through the centre of the square is named for French Resistance leader Henri Rol-Tanguy. It is just one block in length, and connects the Avenue Denfert-Rochereau in the north to the Avenue General Leclerc in the south. The entrance to the Paris Catacombs is located next to a handsome stone building with three romanesque arches across its facade, on the odd-numbered side of Avenue du Colonel-Henri-Rol-Tanguy. This entrance is directly across the street from an identical even-numbered building that houses the Directorate of Roads and Transport (Direction de la Voirie et des D√©placements). These two buildings, classified as historical monuments, are the pavilions of the old Barri√®re d'Enfer, where taxes were collected on goods entering Paris. They are built to the design of the 19th-century architect, Claude Nicolas Ledoux, whose work can be found all over the city. This part of the square has enveloped the site of the Barri√®re d'Enfer, as well as part of the boulevards d'Enfer and Saint- Jacques, and a part of the boulevards Montrouge and Arcueil, roads which, at one time, led to those two southern suburbs but no longer exist. Metro station The Denfert-Rochereau railway station The Place Denfert-Rochereau is served by lines 4 and 6 of the Paris Metro, from Denfert-Rochereau station. It is also served by the RER Line B commuter train from the old railway station of the Sceaux line, the entrance to which is to the east of the square. The Place is the Paris terminus of Orlybus, the RATP shuttle bus service between the city and Orly Airport.

The track was written by the bands' rhythm guitarist and vocalist Paul Stanley. During live performances, bassist Gene Simmons has breathed fire, with red lights flashing and sirens sounding. \\"Firehouse\\" has remained a concert staple and is regarded as one of the band's classic songs. With its fan-favorite status, the song is one of the most played songs in the Kiss catalog, having been played more than 1,400 times as of June 2014. Background Paul Stanley wrote the song while he attended the High School of Music & Art in New York City. He said he was inspired by British rock group the Move's song \\"Fire Brigade\\". The two tracks are similar in their choruses (\\"Get the fire brigade\\" and \\"Get the firehouse\\") and background sound effects. Kiss played the song during its early Wicked Lester period and often afterwards as well. \\"Firehouse\\" was one of the first numbers that Kiss performed during the band's earliest national TV appearances, including ABC's In Concert on February 19, 1974 (aired on March 29). The band also played the song on The Mike Douglas Show on April 29, 1974, a broadcast that included Simmons' first televised interview. \\"Firehouse\\" is associated with Simmons' fire-breathing antics during concerts. One of many incidents occurred on December 31, 1973 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City, when the band was opening for Blue √ñyster Cult. Simmons' hair caught fire for the first of many times. In November 1972, Kiss, then performing as a Stanley-Simmons-Criss trio, played \\"Firehouse\\" along with \\"Strutter\\" and \\"Deuce\\" to Epic Records' A&R; director Don Ellis. The showcase was intended to secure a record deal for the group. During the performance of \\"Firehouse\\", the band started ringing a bell. Stanley, enacting a fire-fighting scenario, then retrieved a red pail and threw it at an alarmed Ellis, who thought there was a real fire taking place. As Ellis was leaving, Peter Criss' drunk brother also vomited on his foot. Ellis later said that it was the worst performance he had ever heard. Live performances \\"Firehouse\\" has remained a constant concert staple, with the band performing it on almost every tour to date.

A man of wide interests, he entered the Vermont Medical College graduating with an MD degree in 1893. Career He became a lecturer on the arts, but a developing concern with South Asian music that led him to give his attention fully to music and to composition. He played the piano and cello, and gave lecture-recitals on music history, Eastern music and Wagner‚Äôs operas. In 1898 he left the United States for Europe, eventually settling in England in 1902.\\"Bertram Shapleigh, Composer\\" Musical Courier (February 6, 1907): 32. However, after his house, with his library of 7000 volumes, had been destroyed by fire, he returned to the USA in 1917, to serve as an adviser to Breitkopf & H√§rtel and editor of the Concert Exchange. He lectured widely, wrote for magazines and newspapers, published three books of poetry and a novel, and composed numerous pieces in various forms. His works are in a Romantic style, sometimes using themes and timbres imitative of Indian music. Legacy After his death in 1940, a Bertram Shapleigh Foundation was established in Washington, DC, and his manuscripts are deposited there. He wrote a number of orchestral works, some including choir; several operas; church music; many songs, and a string quartet, among other chamber works.

They are made of neowa (shingle), giwa (tiles), byeotjib (rice Straw), stone giwa (tiles), eoksae (eulalia) and goolpy (oak bark) Neowa (Shingle) roof Neowa house in Samchuck, Gangwon province Neowajib (a shingle-roofed house) can be seen in mountain villages (for example, in Gangwon-do), since these are places which are hard to get materials, such as Giwa and rice straw. Instead, it is made with the pieces of thick bark of about 200-year-old red pine trees which are easy to get. The size of neowa is not fixed, but it is usually about 20‚Äì30 cm wide, 40‚Äì59 cm long and 4‚Äì5 cm thickness. Usually 105‚Äì140 of neowa used to complete a roof. To protect neowa from the wind, heavy stones or logs were put on the roof. The air can be changed through the gaps between neowa, since there was no smokestack. When it rains, the wood with moisture can have a waterproof effect. In common, neowa's durability is around 5 years. However, it is not true that all of neowa changed at the same time. If there's rotten one it was replaced by new one. Neowajib has rooms, a kitchen and a cow shed under one square roof, to protect domestic animals from mountain beasts, and to keep warm in winter. As red pine trees disappear, neowajib disappear gradually. Finally there are only 3 neowajib in Korea. Giwa (Tile) Looking down on hanok rooftops, Samcheong- dong. Giwa is a construction material for put roofing. It is also called gaewa. One of the basic forms of giwa is amkiwa (flat giwa) and sukiwa (round giwa); one giwa can be made by putting together two of these. Roofs are generally made by this way. Clay is kneaded and is spread thinly. Then amkiwa is extended upward and downward, and sukiwa cover joints at right and left side. By classifying giwa through materials, there are togiwa made by kneading and baking clay, cement giwa-made by mixing cement and sand, and metal giwa made by cutting and making form with metal plate. There were stone giwa and bronze giwa at the ruins of Rome, and marble giwa was used at Greek temples. In addition, there are cheonggiwa, ozigiwa, etc. glazing by various kinds of glaze. As a matter of form, we call original giwa bongiwa and Japanese giwa \\"geolchimgiwa\\". There are giwa in many countries. Byeotjib (Rice Straw) roof Chogajiboong (a straw roof) is made with byeotjib (rice straw), eulalia or reed, but generally made with byeotjib. Byeotjib protects residents from the sun in summer and keeps them warm in winter, because it is empty inside. Moreover, rain falls down well and hardly soaks through a roof because it has a relatively smooth surface. So, a thick roof is not needed. Warm and soft feeling is given by chogajiboong, because of the original properties of byeotjib. It is put over another byeotjib every year, and it shows clean and new feature without any special effort. The gentle roof is used like a farm for drying crops like red pepper and planting pumpkins or gourds. Stone Giwa (Tile) roof Flat layered stone roofs are called argillite (germpanam), on the roof in the much coal produced area; it takes a role of giwa. Giwa is formed in this way. Bluestone (cheongseok) is so smooth as to control raindrops gently. Its system is not different from giwa's. The bluestone is put at the bottom, and then largely different bluestone is put on it. By this way the process is continued. It can endure for a long time. These roofs can be seen commonly in the argillite zone. But it was possible to put this roof only for certain social classes because of the difficulty of purchasing and transporting the materials. Nowadays it can be seen at some areas of Gyeonggi- do and Gangwon-do. Eoksae (Eulalia) roof Korea has ten kinds of eulalia. The eulalia leaf is good for waterproofing and durability. It is a strong material that will last for ten years after covering the roof with eulalia once. The straw rope twisted with eulalia is not only strong and elastic but also good for waterproofing. It is used in weaving rain-gear (rainwear) or straw sandals. The material should be dried with dew for a week. Then it is put in a shady pot for good airing. Goolpy (Oak Bark) roof This is a kind of roof material used usually in mountain villages. The oak bark is over 20 years old. At first, the oak bark is peeled at the time of Chuseo (one of the 24 seasonal divisions, about August 23). Next it is put into water. After that, it is dried and a heavy stone is placed on it to flatten it. Bark made this way is commonly about 1.3 meters wide. If the air gets dry, the bark shrinks and obtains many holes. However, if it rains or its humidity is increased, holes get smaller and smaller. At last they disappear quickly. The stone between the joint is not to blow the bark. The life of the oak bark is so long that there is a saying, \\"Giwa exists for ten thousand years, and the Oak Bark for one thousand years.\\" References External links * Korean architecture Roofs Timber framing Roof tiles ","title":"Traditional Korean roof construction"},{"id":"18821594","text":"John Adam Hugo circa 1920 John Adam Hugo (1873‚Äì1945) was an American composer, born in Connecticut.

He wrote a number of anthems, songs, and part-songs, as well as some pieces for piano and for organ. He was early leader of the American Guild of Organists, and from 1911 until his death he served as organist at Church of the Messiah (New York City). Biography Clifford Demarest was born in Tenafly, New Jersey, which remained his home for his entire life. His father, a successful businessman, ran a general store; his mother was a capable musician who played the organ at the local Presbyterian Church. Demarest learned music first from her, later studying with the organist R. Huntington Woodman at the Metropolitan College of Music, New York.Benjamin, W. H. (1908). Biographies of Celebrated Organists of America. Albany, NY: The Benjamin Publishing Co., p. 41.

M.A. Thesis, Arizona State University. Career In 1901 Demarest was appointed organist and choir director at the Reformed Church on the Heights, Brooklyn. The following year he passed the examination to become a Fellow of the American Guild of Organists, and he played a central role in that organization for two decades.Armstrong, Agnes. \\"American Guild of Organists Centennial: The Examinations and Academic Regalia of the American Guild of Organists.\\" The American Organist (July 1996): 1-17. For ten years he also dabbled in business ventures with members of his family; but in 1911 he became organist at the Church of the Messiah, New York, and thereafter concentrated solely on music. The minister, John Haynes Holmes, was a progressive reformer and pacifist who became a close personal friend and who helped shape Demarest's interest in education, reform, and musical communities.Holmes, John Haynes (1960). The Collected Hymns of John Haynes Holmes. Boston: Beacon Press. p. 100. From about 1915 Demarest began playing recitals and touring on behalf of the A. G. O. In 1919 fire destroyed the Church of the Messiah, and Demarest became music supervisor at Tenafly High School. He returned to be organist at the church after it was rebuilt, but he also continued teaching until 1937. He played at the church until his death. Music Demarest composed almost exclusively for the church, producing music for organ and for solo and ensemble voices. He copyrighted a steady stream of music from 1899 forwards, averaging about four or five pieces per year, though his productivity declined after 1927. His primary publishers were G. Schirmer and Arthur P. Schmidt. He was musically conservative as both player and composer, preferring music that directly addressed the needs and tastes of churchgoers and listeners and rejecting theatrical performances characterised by novel effects. His brief treatise on organ playing is a model of practicality.Demarest, Clifford (1910). Hints on Organ Accompaniment. New York: The H. W. Gray Company. But he was versatile and open-minded, incorporating idioms from popular music into several extended compositions for piano and organ. He worked closely with John Haynes Holmes, and one of his most ambitious and successful pieces, \\"America Triumphant,\\" set Holmes's poetry.Demarest, Clifford (1915). \\"America Triumphant\\". Boston: Arthur P. Schmidt. Holmes was a strong supporter of the Harlem Renaissance, and Demarest followed his lead by introducing spirituals and other music of African Americans into services at the church. Demarest was not an innovator, but he provided a steadying hand in leading his profession, true service to communities in his church and elsewhere, and a body of music that was highly regarded by his peers.

The group, consisting of Abdel Majeed Asslan, Mhanna Salim al-Muayed, and Ahmed al-Abras, and led by 16-year-old Samir Kuntar, used a small, boat to travel from Tyre, Lebanon to Israel. During the attack they killed three Israelis, including a father and two of his young children. Another child was accidentally suffocated in efforts to hide her from the attackers. Kuntar and al-Abras were captured, convicted of murder by an Israeli court, and sentenced to several life sentences. Both Kuntar and al-Abras were later set free in prisoner swap deals conducted between Israel and Lebanese militant organizations ‚Äì al-Abras in 1985, and Kuntar in 2008. Details of the attack Arrival On April 22, 1979, a group of four Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) militants entered Israel from Lebanon by boat. Translated by the website of the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs Retrieved July 17, 2008 The group was headed by Samir Kuntar (born in 1962) and included Abdel Majeed Asslan (born in 1955), Mhanna Salim Al-Muayed (born in 1960) and Ahmed AlAbras (born in 1949) ‚Äì all members of the PLF under the leadership of Abu Abbas. The group departed from the seashore of Tyre in Southern Lebanon using a 55 horse-powered motorized rubber boat with an 88 km/h speed. Their goal was to attack Nahariya, 10 kilometers away from the Lebanese border. Around midnight they arrived at the coastal town of Nahariya. Killing of Eliyahu Shahar Upon landing on the beach in Nahariya, the group followed instructions issued in Beirut ‚Äì which included finding a police officer and killing him. They knocked on the door of a private house and called out in Arabic via the intercom, frightening the residents into calling the police. Then, they killed responding police officer Eliyahu Shahar. According to the Israeli security services' reconstruction of the incident, Shahar was killed after he got out of his vehicle and fired two warning shots into the air. Kuntar's group responded with a massive burst of gunfire. Samir Kuntar boasted that he alone shot 30 bullets in this incident. Raid on apartment building and kidnapping The group then entered an apartment building on 61 Jabotinsky Street planning to abduct two or three people and take them back to Lebanon. One of the PFLP men, Abdel Majeed Asslan, broke into the apartment of Charles Shapiro, 34, a recent immigrant from South Africa, after the doors to his apartment had been shot up. Shapiro, who was armed with a .22 caliber magnum revolver, shot Asslan dead. \\"The Achille Lauro Hijacking: Lessons in the Politics and Prejudice of Terrorism\\" By Michael K.

Next, Kuntar's group encountered Moshe Sasson, a resident who was trying to reach the building's bomb shelter carrying his two young daughters, one under each arm. Kuntar shoved Sasson and slammed a handgun into the back of his skull. However, Sasson escaped when the hall lights suddenly went out, and hid under a parked car. The three remaining militants then broke into the apartment of the Haran family. They took 31-year-old Danny Haran hostage along with his four-year-old daughter, Einat. The mother, Smadar Haran, was able to hide in a crawl space above the bedroom with her two-year-old daughter Yael, and a neighbor ‚Äì Sasson's wife. Shootout on the beach Danny, Einat and Yael Haran. According to eyewitnesses and forensic reports, Kuntar shot Danny at close range in the back, in front of his daughter, and then killed the girl Einat, by smashing her skull against the rocks with the butt of his rifle. Kuntar's group then took Danny and Einat down to the beach, where a shootout erupted with Israeli policemen and a squad of soldiers from the elite Sayeret Golani special forces unit. According to eyewitnesses, when Kuntar's group found that the rubber boat they'd arrived in was disabled by gunfire, Kuntar shot Danny at close range in the back, in front of his daughter, and drowned him in the sea to ensure he was dead. Next, according to forensic evidence and eyewitness court testimony, Kuntar killed the girl by smashing her skull against the rocks with the butt of his rifle. Smadar Haran accidentally suffocated Yael to death while attempting to quiet her whimpering, which would have revealed their hiding place.Beyer, Lisa, \\"A Mother's Anguish Renewed\\", Time Magazine, July 25, 2006.

Retaliation The day after the attack, Israeli Navy gunboats bombarded Nahr el-Bared, a Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut described by an Israeli military spokesman as a major base for the PFLP. The bombardment lasted an hour, and three civilians were reportedly killed. On December 19, 2015, Kuntar was killed by an explosion destroying a six-story residential building in Jaramana on the outskirts of Damascus.

Trial The pathologist's report, declassified in 2008, showed that 4 year old Einat Haran's brain tissue was found on Kuntar's rifle. Samir Kuntar and Ahmed AlAbras were convicted of murdering four people by an Israeli court in 1980, and sentenced to four life sentences, and an additional 47 years for injuries inflicted. On July 13, 2008, after being classified for nearly thirty years, File No. 578/79, containing the evidence and testimony from Kuntar's 1980 trial, was first published. According to the file, evidence presented by the pathologist at the trial showed that Einat Haran was killed by the force of a blunt instrument ‚Äì most likely a rifle butt. The pathologist's report also showed that Einat's brain tissue was found on Kuntar's rifle. Immediately following his capture, when his remand was extended, Kuntar confessed that he had bludgeoned Einat to death with the butt of his rifle. Later, however, when testifying in court, Kuntar denied the charges. In his testimony, Kuntar asserted that Israeli gunfire had killed Danny Haran as soldiers burst in to free him, and that he did not see what happened to Einat after passing out from blood lost from five bullet wounds.Kraft, Dina \\"Prisoner Deal Reopens an Israeli Wound\\", The New York Times, July 16, 2008.

In Israel, Kuntar was considered the perpetrator of one of the most brutal terrorist attacks in the country's history, while in Lebanon he was widely regarded as a national hero. The killing of Einat Haran is regarded as one of the most brutal terror attacks in the history of Israel. A day after the attack, Abu Abbas, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Front announced from Beirut that the terrorist attack in Nahariya had been carried out \\"to protest the signing of the Egyptian‚ÄìIsraeli Peace Treaty\\" at Camp David the previous year. In 1980, Smadar Haran married Yakov Kaiser, a clinical psychologist who had been severely wounded in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. They have two daughters.

The first episode ran on September 2, 2002 and the show continued to run for almost two years even though only 13 episodes were produced. Its main claim to fame is that it was the first cartoon in the world that was animated entirely in Flash and appeared on a national television network. The show met with some success but was taken off the air when funding ran out due to cuts to the CTF program. The show was born from a 10-minute pilot written and animated by Brent Donnelly and Derry Smith and produced by Valis Video (Toronto). The pilot can be viewed on YouTube along with some aired episodes of Daft Planet. Plot The plot, set in the fictional Maple City, encircles the day-to-day lives of the protagonists, Ched and Hudson, in their on-going struggle to keep up with the latest trends and maintain their positions in the social hierarchy in high school. With Ched living from a trailer park, as the son of a taxidermist and Hudson as the son of a wealthy network executive, a parallel is drawn between the two characters, offering unlikely chemistry. No one in the show has necks, and their heads just float over their bodies, but this is never mentioned and they have no apparent difficulty doing things that would require necks, like eating or breathing.

Museum plans may include some or all of the following: * A review of institutional resources, assets and collections * A review of local attractions and museums * A new or updated mission and vision * Collections objectives of the new institution * Educational objectives of the new institution * Experience objectives of the new institution * Potential visitor and other audience and user groups * Interpretive Plan * Exhibition storylines * Visitor flow diagrams * Thematic treatments * Preliminary exhibition layout * Style Boards * Exhibition Renderings * Space Needs Analysis * Site selection * Architectural Concepts * Preliminary staffing plan * Preliminary project schedule * Preliminary project budget Plans are created by a museum planning team, that includes; museum staff and volunteers, members of the board of directors, community members, and representatives of city and state planning agencies working together with a museum planner, architects, exhibit designers, economists, and other specialist consultants. The objective of a Museum Plan is to create a clear and concise ‚Äúroad map‚Äù for the creation of new institution and a sustainable long term museum vision. Museum planning may also refer to the designing of museum galleries, spaces, or new wings and buildings. The goal of a well-designed museum space is that it accents the collection, and puts the patron at ease. There are many features of galleries that must be considered when organizing and planning a new space. Some of those aspects are circulation, density, lighting, backgrounds, arrangement, and labels. The circulation of the space indicates the layout and direction of flow for visitors. This can be done by numbering objects, or the layout of displays. Poor circulation can result in the patron missing some galleries or displays or viewing objects in an order other than what the curator intended. Circulation should feel natural and logical; the patron may feel herded and become resentful. Density, clarity, and emphasis are other aspects to consider when planning a new space. Galleries and individual objects should be placed so that everything appears to have equal value and importance. Then within displays, objects should not be overcrowded or cluttered. Lighting is extremely important and cannot be overlooked when planning new galleries. Natural light is ideal, but it must be filtered, and not too intense. It also should be consistent throughout the day ‚Äì northern and southern exposure is ideal. Backgrounds can refer to a number of things: props, panels, or a simple painted wall can serve as a background to an object or display. These must be subdued enough that they do not detract from the object on display, but they should be complementary. The specific position, arrangement, and display of an object is important to consider. Height of the display case, order in which objects are placed or hung, and the grouping of certain objects are all major factors in how patrons interpret objects. Museum label and explanatory accessories are essential to a patron‚Äôs experience in a museum. Enough information should be provided that the patron feels as if they understand what they are looking at, but too much can bore or confuse the visitor. Some examples of these accessories are collection guides available for the overall museum experience, larger panels at the start of each gallery that can explain the intent of the collection, and smaller panels at each object should inform the viewer the object‚Äôs use, medium, creator, and dates.

History  Hoops were used to deliver orders to passing trains Puget Sound Electric Railway, the Interurban Line near Tacoma The PSE began operations on September 25, 1902 with a line that started in downtown Tacoma, ran along Pacific and Puyallup Avenues, followed the course of present day Pacific Highway through Fife and to Milton, turned southeast towards Puyallup and paralleled the path of today's SR 167 through Pacific, Algona, Auburn, Kent, Orillia and Renton, then into Seattle on its own dedicated right-of-way, via South Park, from there running on surface streets to the area near Pioneer Square, where it interchanged with other interurbans in the area. Power was supplied via overhead wire in urban areas, and third rail in rural areas. The third rail was the cause of several accidents throughout the PSE's operations which involved livestock or people being electrocuted, and in some cases dead cows caused accidents involving the trolleys themselves. The railroad ran for 26 years, until competition from trucks, buses, and automobiles on an ever-expanding road network, as well as the steam railroads, led to reduced ridership in the early 1920s and a decision to shut down operations was made by the operators. Despite protests, the interurban was allowed to suspend operations by a federal judge in a ruling made on October 13, 1928. The final trains ran on December 30, 1928.

Considered a part of the Black Arts movement, he first received attention for his book of poems entitled The Beautiful Days (1965). In 1966, he published a book on the then recent history of jazz entitled Four Lives in the Bebop Business (aka Black Music: Four Lives; Random House). From 1975 to 2005, he worked as an arts administrator for the National Endowment for the Arts. He has been instrumental in supporting jazz in the United States. Biography Born August 12, 1935, in Nixonton, North Carolina, Spellman, the son of two teachers, attended P.W. Moore High School in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where he was a member of the basketball team, glee club and oratorical club. After graduating in 1953, he entered Howard University, where he was active in the chorus, the Howard Players, and he began his writing career. During his time at Howard, he met and befriended classmate Leroi Jones (Amiri Baraka), whose own interest in furthering black art would act as a considerable influence on Spellman's future endeavors. He graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science degree in political science and then continued with studies in Howard's law school. In 1959, Spellman began a career as a music critic for magazines such as Metronome and Down Beat, for which he wrote reviews of jazz music and musicians. His first book of poems, The Beautiful Days, was published by Poets Press in 1965. Not only was the work well received, it considerably raised his profile as a writer. His reputation, however, was truly solidified by his first full-length book, Four Lives in the Bebop Business (also known as Four Jazz Lives, 1966) a study of the lives of jazz musicians Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, Herbie Nichols, and Jackie McLean. His experience with jazz has long influenced the form and rhythm of his poetry, and at the 2016 National Book Festival, Joy Harjo, co- presenting with Spellman, referred to him as \\"one of the major ancestors of jazz poetry.\\" During the 1960s, Spellman wrote liner notes for several Blue Note Records albums. After touring the nation with several other African- American poets in 1967, Spellman joined the staff of Rhythm Magazine, where he wrote poems and political essays until 1969. After leaving the magazine, he conducted a series of lectures at universities throughout the United States, including Morehouse College, Emory University, Rutgers University, and Harvard. Spellman also started the Atlanta Center for Black Art, one of the many grass-roots initiatives in the growing Atlanta community of black artists that sought to further develop the arts in the black communities beyond the college and university campuses and even beyond Atlanta. The Center, although an independent organization, relied on many staff and faculty from the local universities to offer art instruction and performances in a variety of genres, from poetry readings to dramatic plays. In 1973, Spellman left Harvard to become director of the Arts in Education Study Project for the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA) in Washington, DC. Three years later, he became the director of the NEA's Arts Endowment Expansion Program, a position he held for the next eight years. Between 1994 and 1996, he served as associate deputy for program coordination at the NEA and then became the director of the NEA's Office of Guidelines and Panel Operations. In 1998, he was appointed the deputy chairman for the Office of Guidelines, Panel and Council Operations for the NEA where he remained until his retirement in 2005. In 2008, he released Things I Must Have Known, a collection of poetry, with Coffee House Press. Shortly after the release of this collection, Spellman spoke in an interview on the importance of small presses, declaring them to be \\"absolutely essential for poetry.\\" He notes that without these small presses, he and many other poets like him would find no outlet for their work, for the larger publishing companies and commercial magazines publish little poetry to begin with and certainly even fewer works by poets that have not yet made a name for themselves. A. B. Spellman married Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) activist and producer Karen Edmonds Spellman on October 14, 1969; they have two daughters, Toyin Spellman Diaz, oboist for Imani Winds, and Kaji Spellman Dou≈°a, Senior Pastor of Park Avenue Christian Church.

It was chosen by the Italian Regio Esercito to serve as their new field gun, but licence production by Ansaldo was slow. Some more were produced during the interwar years, but the captured Austrian Obice da 100/17 was generally considered to be superior. It was originally designed to be towed by horses with wooden- spoked wheels. Some weapons may have been modernized for tractor-towing with steel-spoked wheels and pneumatic tires. For transport the box trail was supported by a small limber. Howitzers captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in 1943 were given the designation of 10.5 cm leichte Feldhaubitze 326(i), although it is unknown to what extent they were actually used. Both references listed below believe this gun was developed in the 1930s, but this seems unlikely given the photographic evidence of the designation as modello 18.

Placement marriage is believed and practiced by members of the FLDS Church to show their commitment and obedience in order to obtain salvation for themselves and their parents; it might be considered ‚Äúthe most visible outward symbol of members‚Äô devotion.\\"Watson, Marianne. ‚ÄúThe 1948 Secret Marriage of Louis J. Barlow: Origins of the FLDS Placement Marriage.‚Äù Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, 40, (2007) :83-136  Origin  The Fundamentalist Latter Day Saint group is one of eight primary Fundamentalist Mormon groups; other well known groups include: Apostolic United Brethren, Latter Day Church of Christ (also known of as the \\"Kingston group\\"), Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days, and the Centennial Park group (also known of as \\"The Work of Jesus Christ\\" or just \\"The Work\\"). Placement marriage is a practice that uniquely belongs to the FLDS Church, although there may be some similarities between the beliefs in marriage practices with the Latter Day Church of Christ. The idea of placement marriage within the FLDS Church did not exist prior to the 1940s. The group which eventually became known as the FLDS changed the concepts of courtship and marriage for their followers over the past fifty years. Before that most, if not all, fundamentalist Mormons chose marriage partners according to patterns which mirrored those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the nineteenth century, in that their decisions for marriage were made by considering \\"varied combinations of personal attraction and principles of faith (which usually included testimony or personal revelation) along with direct or indirect influence of family and ecclesiastical leaders‚Äù. This latter method of freely choosing marriage partners is still predominately used by most Mormon fundamentalists who believe in or practice plural marriage. Most fundamentalist Mormons, apart from the FLDS, do not practice arranged marriages. Rather, they believe that arranged marriages violate the members‚Äô \\"free agency\\". Most fundamentalist Mormons today are not and never were members of the LDS Church, because that church renounced polygamy in 1890 and excommunicated any of its members who were found to be practicing \\"plural marriage\\" (i.e. polygamy). Most fundamentalist Mormons today are descendants of those who were excommunicated from the LDS Church for entering into polygamous marriages.  During the fundamentalist split (early 1950s)  Changes in the way marriage partners were selected was one of the major issues that ultimately led to divisions of the fundamentalists Mormon community in the early 1950s. Some leaders encouraged younger girls and women to marry without their parents' knowledge or consent if their parents were considered \\"out of harmony\\" with priesthood leaders; such girls and women were instead encouraged to be placed in a marriage under the direction of priesthood leaders. Placement marriage became the common practice in Short Creek during the presidency of Leroy Johnson. This was primarily due to a belief that obedience to priesthood was necessary for salvation, that the Priesthood Council leaders were the ones entitled to revelation regarding marriage‚Äîespecially plural marriage, and the fact that the members believed that placement marriage was a more divine observance than when they chose their own spouse. Members generally respected the right of the Priesthood Council to assign marriages. Parents' consent for their children to marry in plural marriage was considered relevant when they were \\"in harmony\\" with the Priesthood Council.  During the late 1980s and early 1990s   Changes in authority  Before Leroy Johnson died, he dismissed two of the remaining three members of the Priesthood Council, leaving only himself and Rulon Jeffs. After Johnson's death, Jeffs was the only remaining Priesthood Council member. He assumed leadership over the group and asserted his position that a priesthood council was no longer needed and that he alone held priesthood authority to rule. In 1991 Jeffs legally incorporated the group as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Marianne T. Watson, in her article \\"The 1948 Secret Marriage of Louis J. Barlow: Origins of FLDS Placement Marriage,\\" stated that this fundamentalist group ‚Äúwhole- heartedly sustained the arranged-marriage system\\" and that \\"After the death of Leroy Johnson, they advocated complete obedience to Rulon Jeffs, considering him to be the prophet, the Keyholder, and the mouth piece of God‚Äù. = The first wife = Under the placement marriage system, young members of the FLDS Church are not allowed to court or date before marriage and are discouraged to fall in love until after they are married. They are permitted to become acquainted with one another through the community, church, school, or family ties, but they are not allowed to be more than just friends with anyone until the Priesthood Council arranges a spouse for them. When a young man, generally around the age of twenty-one, feels ready to be married he approaches the Priesthood Council and then they decide who he will marry.Quinn, Michael. ‚ÄúPlural Marriage and Mormon Fundamentalism.‚Äù Dialogue 31, (1998) :1-68 They select a wife for the young man through a process of inspiration and revelation. When a woman feels prepared to be married, around the ages of 16 to 25, she informs her father of her own readiness, and is taken to meet with the prophet to tell him that she is ready to be married. While most women are approved, some are asked to wait for a time. If the prophet agrees to place her, then the future spouse is notified, and a ceremony is performed generally within the week and sometimes immediately. A woman's opinions relative to the selection of her husband are sometimes considered but not always, and she can decide against marrying a man who is selected for her, although this does not happen very frequently. = Plural marriage = The ages of a man's plural wives can vary greatly, although the first wife is generally close to the husband‚Äôs age. The process for entering a plural marriage is slightly different. Married men do not normally volunteer themselves to enter plural marriage, but wait to be asked by the Priesthood Council. Delaying is allowed but declining is generally frowned upon. If a man does decline he's considered unfaithful for rejecting the decision made for him by the Priesthood. All of the choices about when, where, and whom he will marry are generally decisions made by the priesthood leaders. = Success of marriages = Within this group, the idea of not knowing their spouse until minutes before they are married is usually viewed as romantic. The couple is expected to learn to love one another, even if affection isn‚Äôt instantaneous. Several couples are grateful for this practice because they believe ‚Äúthe only sure revelation comes from the prophet; they were glad to have a prophet to tell them whom to marry.‚Äù The priesthood leader of the Colorado City (FLDS) group chooses to arrange marriages because it reassures the members of the stability and permanence that is promised in a placement marriage. They also choose this approach so that the couples are not closely related in the isolated community. Some members have confessed that some of the marriages were less successful and a few failed completely. = Courtship contrast = In a study of one fundamentalist Mormon group that does not practice placement marriage, it was learned that young people are allowed to court with the permission of the girl's parents. Fathers are generally consulted before any daughter goes out on a date; if not, the young man might be reprimanded. Sometimes older men court younger women with parental consent. However, for teenagers, like in the LDS church, one-on-one dating is highly discouraged. Most young members go out in groups.Bennion Janet. Women of Principle. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. Also, some men in good standing were appointed to give permission for others to court. Their guidance was also requested by a man looking for a wife. Most fundamentalist Mormon groups, including the FLDS, have recently stated that they no longer permit plural marriages for underage women.  During Warren Jeffs Presidency  There were suspicions that Warren Jeffs may have done away with the volunteer feature for young women who didn‚Äôt come to him and say they were ready to be married. Underage marriage and marriages between close relatives has apparently been common in the FLDS Church. Arranged marriages of young girls to much older men, whom they may not even know, are not out of the ordinary. It is also common for these men to be relatives who already have wives. One writer believes incest is permitted and considered doctrine in a large number of groups.Moore-Emmett, Andrea. God‚Äôs Brothel. San Francisco: Pince-nez Press, 2004. However, most fundamentalist Mormons deny this and say they neither permit nor practice incest.  Wives of excommunicated men  In October 2002 the FLDS announced Warren Jeffs as the new president of the FLDS Church. Under Warren Jeffs' leadership, many male members were excommunicated. The wives, along with children and sometimes property, of these men are reassigned to other \\"more faithful\\" men. Some wives were reassigned more than once. If the wives did not agree to do as Jeffs instructed, they were also told to leave. Andrea Moore-Emmett, author of God's Brothel wrote this about placement marriages: ‚ÄúWhether a woman is already married or not, ‚Äúreleasings‚Äù (divorces) and ‚Äúsealings‚Äù (marriages) from one man to another man are at the whim of the leader‚Äù.  Moving away from Colorado City/Hildale  Within a year of becoming president, Warren Jeffs began to send small numbers of members to other places outside of Colorado City and Hildale‚Äìsuch as the site in Texas.  Legal conflicts  = Incest and child marriages = Instances such as this can lead to problems with the law. One man in a small group of Mormon fundamentalists called the Latter Day Church of Christ, founded by Charles W.

Early life Henderson was born in Brooklyn in 1850 and was the son of Isaac Henderson (1814‚Äì1884) and Margaret (n√©e Johnston) Henderson (1818‚Äì1873). He had three sisters, including elder sister, Josephine Wheaton Henderson, was married to Col. Henry Cary Weir, of West Point in 1865. During President Abraham Lincoln's presidency, his father was appointed Navy Agent in May 1861, \\"thereby becoming both a civilian employee of the Navy Department and a disbursing officer of the government subject to Treasury Department supervision.\\" In 1864, his father was arrested and tried for issuing false vouchers when he was Navy Agent. After a well publicized trial, he was found not guilty on technical grounds. After an early education in private schools and under tutors, he graduated from Williams College with the degrees of Bachelor and Master of Arts, and Doctor of Civil Law. Career In 1872, Henderson became connected with the New York Evening Post, becoming assistant publisher in 1875, and from 1877 was publisher, stockholder, and member of the Board of Trustees. The Post was owned by his father in partnership with William Cullen Bryant, the editor-in-chief, and John Bigelow (who sold his interest after Lincoln's election when he became a diplomat). His father had first joined the Post as a clerk in 1839, before becoming bookkeeper and, later, manager of a printing shop which allowed him to buy a one-third interest in the partnership that controlled the Post in 1854. His father's career at the Post ended in 1878 when an investigation revealed he had defrauded Bryant for thirty years. Henderson sold his interest in the Evening Post in 1881, he went to Europe and lived in London and Rome. In 1896, he became a Roman Catholic, adopting the name of Austin at his Confirmation. In 1903 he was appointed private chamberlain to Pope Pius X. Published works In 1886, Henderson published his first novel, The Prelate, and followed it two years later with Agatha Page. The latter, soon (1892) dramatized as The Silent Battle, was produced by Sir Charles Wyndham at the Criterion Theatre, London, another dramatic version, entitled Agatha, being produced the same year at the Boston Museum. His second drama, The Mummy and the Humming Bird, was presented at Wyndham's Theatre, 1901, the principal male part being again taken by Wyndham. In 1902 it was played at the Empire Theatre, New York. Personal life Henderson was the father of Ruth Henderson (d. 1933), who married Hon. Walter Patrick Lindsay (1873‚Äì1936), third son of James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford, in 1902 at the Dominican Convent in Rome. Ruth and Walter divorced in 1927. Henderson died in Rome on March 31, 1909. Descendants Through his daughter Ruth, he was a grandfather of Kenneth Andrew Lindsay (1903‚Äì1970) and Margaret Elspeth Lindsay (1905‚Äì1974). Kenneth married Kathleen Mary Lovemore (daughter of H. E. Lovemore) and Margaret married George Shirley Rawlings, son of the Rev. George William Rawlings and brother of actress Margaret Rawlings.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The district includes portions of what were lots 73 through 84 of the Tybee Improvement Company, which purchased the island in 1873 and subdivided \\"The Strand\\" area in that year. It is located between Butler Avenue and the Atlantic Ocean, from a bit past 12th Street to 14th Street. This is the section between two former hotels, Ocean House at the north and Tybee Hotel at the south. Besides the cottages, two other contributing resources of the district were identified: \\"one historic site consisting of the overall coastal landscape design; and one structure consisting of the entire system of communal walkways and boardwalk.\\" The walkways ran from hotel to hotel through the cottages. The 1873 plan was for each of the 12 narrow lots to contain a single cottage set back at the center of their lots, with a long grassy expanse in a front area and an extensive rear area. A common path crossed the properties at the front steps of the cottages. Since then, multiple cottages have been inserted into most of the lots and most lots have been legally subdivided. However, within the historic district, three lots (77, 80, 81) still conform to their original 1873 plan, two (74, 75) have their original front portions, and one (83) has its original rear area. Tybee Island is the only coastal resort in Georgia comparable to other examples in the American coastal resort movement such as Cape May, New Jersey, Long Branch, New Jersey, and Nantucket, Massachusetts.

Preserved Harrington Cavalier bodied AEC Reliance Thomas Harrington & Sons was a coachbuilder in the county of Sussex from 1897 until 1966, initially at Brighton but from 1930 until the end in a purpose built Art Deco factory (an image of which was used on the builder's transfers) in Old Shoreham Road, Hove.Platt & Lukowski, The Harrington Grenadier and Cavalier, Wellington (Somerset) 1991 Overview The company began with the construction of horse-drawn carriages. With the rise of motor vehicle, Thomas Harrington began building on motor car chassis, and prior to World War I began to specialise in commercial vehicles, buses and coaches. After the armistice the company concentrated on luxury coaches supplementing these with some single-deck bus bodies and other general coachbuilding activity. During World War II, it was selected by the War Ministry to build a specialised aircraft design and during their history they also produced ¬º - scale street-legal model coaches to entertain children, pioneered a minibus that bus operators found practical (and legal) to use and drove-forward coach design. They had an open outlook on developments in technology and an excellent grasp of marketing opportunities and an eye for a catchy press advertisement. They nurtured relationships with customers, one at least bought nothing other than Harrington for its entire existence. In 1965 it was decided to close the factory. Although not a part of the Rootes Group, the operations were owned by a Rootes family investment company. Production ceased in April 1966 after which Plaxton purchased spares, stock in trade and goodwill. The Cavalier (1959‚Äì64) and Grenadier (1962-6) luxury coach bodies for underfloor-engined chassis jointly won the Classic Bus reader poll as the most stylish coach of all time.Classic Bus issue 12, Edinburgh 1992 Many Harrington vehicles are preserved and Harrington devotees have a gathering of their own. The 1930s There were huge numbers of small to medium-sized professional coachbuilders in existence around Britain as Thomas Harrington & Sons moved into its new Hove factory. The management of Harringtons decided that two things were necessary to stand them in good stead in this crowded market. The first was building good relationships with blue-chip customers, and the second was to produce designs with a distinctive Harrington 'look'. Instances of the first were their long-term supply to high‚Äìclass coach firms in the private and large company sectors. Such private customers included Grey-Green of Stamford Hill, London, Charlies Cars of Bournemouth and Silver Star of Porton Down. The large firms included the Tilling Group's North Western Road Car Company of Stockport and British Electric Traction (BET) group member Devon General of Exeter, but perhaps the most enduring relationship of all was as supplier to the local BET coaching powerhouse Southdown Motor Services.Booth, Gavin. Classic Bus 41-2, Edinburgh, May 1999 - July 1999 The styling distinctiveness was a major selling point. A Harrington body had a clear 'look' at a time when many coachbuilders, Duple especially, would oblige customers and produce an astounding variety of outlines from the conservative to the totally bizarre, sometimes building to order straight copies of another coachbuilders style.Townsin, Alan. Duple: 70 Years of Coachbuilding, Glossop, 1998 By the mid-1930s the Harrington 'look' included a half cab with no canopy over the engineBooth, Gavin. Classic Bus 42, Edinburgh, July 1999 and a stepped window line, all arranged in a distinctive flowing series of curves.Watson. Provincial buses in colour: 1960's, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham (2001) By the end of the decade when streamlining was the vogue Harrington had devised and patented a new feature called the 'dorsal fin'. This appurtenance looked like a truncated aircraft tail and when applied to the rear of the vehicle allowed a rakishly curved rear-dome outline without compromising passenger access to the rear bench seat and was designed to act as an air-extractor as the vehicle moved, stale air exited the coach saloon due to the suction effect of the low pressure areas created behind the fin.Booth, Gavin (ed), Classic Bus 31, Edinburgh September 1997  World War II: new products, new materials, new methods  But at this time Europe was returning to war, and coach operations ceased, many operators having their vehicles impressed into military service. By the middle of 1940 all non-essential production had been frozen on Government orders and the entire vehicle-building industry had to turn to war work. Harrington were allocated the Westland Lysander aircraft to build. This was a short take off and landing STOL single-engine type, designed as an artillery spotter, which became noteworthy for its use in covert operations to and from occupied France. As well as the benefits of this to the war effort, it gave Harrington's workforce new skills in jig-building using lightweight alloy sections and extrusions. Post-war After the war demand for new buses and coaches was somewhat pent-up as few had been delivered during the war. However, the country had a massive war debt to pay and all manufacturing industries were exhorted to devote at least 50% of output to export. Harrington was able to build a satisfactory export trade, particularly to South American operators and to those in British African colonies. For the home market most bodies were framed in steel-reinforced hardwood. Because all the established firms were trying to export, and thus were not able to offer even their most loyal customers acceptable lead-times, the period from 1946 to the early 1950s caused a mushrooming of small coachbuilders. There were many new models and styles of coach. In Harrington's case these included (from 1948) the normal control Leyland Comet CPO1 with its small capacity 300 cu in direct-injection diesel and the Commer Avenger full-fronted forward control lightweight coach, with its big Humber petrol engine tilted over to 70 degrees so it hid under the coach floor. Commer was part of the Rootes Group, later the Rootes family bought Harrington and John C Beadle. For customers wanting a return to pre-war glamour, the 'dorsal fin' was available as an option even on the next generation. The Wayfarer This was designed for the new underfloor-engined chassis from AEC, Leyland and others but was also to be found on three of the Foden rear engined coach chassis.Booth, Gavin (ed), Classic Bus 39, Edinburgh, January 1999 The Wayfarer ran to four marks and was produced from 1951 to 1961, the longest life of any Harrington design. It was the first to the new dimensions of 30 ft long by 8 ft wide and the first Harrington coach to feature a marque name. Grey-Green bought every version of the type and also took Harrington-bodied Bedfords throughout the 1950s; Silver Star took marks 1, 3 and 4 on Leyland; Southdown only took the Mark I on Royal Tiger in 1952 and then deserted Harrington until 1960; Charlies Cars took Harrington-bodied Albion Victors and in 1958 had two Wayfarer Mark 4 on Albion Aberdonian chassis. North Western had been transferred from Tilling to BET during World War II and took Wayfarers of Marks 1, 3 and 4 for its touring coaches but went elsewhere for express types, notably toward the end of the decade to Alexander. Mini coaches and minibuses From the early 1930s until the mid-1950s Harrington employee and former Southdown driver Ernie Johnstone constructed 63 quarter-scale road-legal coaches to give novelty rides to young children. Many of these were powered by Villiers 125cc two-stroke petrol engines. Bodies on 12 of these working models were constructed by Harrington, the rest he did himself with two friends in his spare time. During the 1950s Harrington, like Plaxton and Readings offered small party coaches on Karrier and Commer delivery van chassis, whilst from the late 1950s until the factory's closure, Harrington was responsible for producing the Rootes Group's in-house PSV conversion of the Commer 1500 minbus. After Harrington's demise the minibus work went to the former Tilling-Stevens works in Maidstone. Customers of the minibus included Crosville, the first time the state sector had been served by Harrington since 1949, when United Automobile Services took a batch of Bristol coaches bodied in Hove for their prestigious Newcastle to London service. The state-owned bus firms' lack of interest in outside suppliers had one over-riding reason: In 1948 ECW and Bristol were served with a statutory ban on selling bodies to other than wholly government-owned organisations and thus ECW took care of almost all of the Tilling Group's bus and coach body needs, produced London Transport's first genuine coaches, and supplied some bodies to the Sheffield Transport C fleet and the Scottish Bus Group. The contender in a contracting market From 1953 to 1969 former Tilling-Stevens factory built the Commer TS3, a compact, if noisy, two-stroke opposed-piston diesel engine adopted in Commer commercials and later marks of its Avenger bus chassis. Harrington (like Beadle) employed units from the Avenger together with a mid-mounted TS3 engine in its Contender range of integral buses and coaches of the mid-1950s, some of these resembled the Wayfarer and others had the standard bus outline of the time, but there was a special design built for British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) this had a straight waistrail and a multi-paned lantern-type windscreen. (One at least of these was powered by an eight-cylinder Rolls-Royce petrol engine of military pattern, driving a torque-converter transmission. An odd choice of propulsion in the fuel-economy obsessed 1950s but they were probably a lot lighter on petrol than a Boeing Stratocruiser or a Lockheed Super Constellation). This style of Contender was sold in 1:76.8 scale model by Dinky Toys as their 'BOAC Coach' BOAC took 28, of which nineteen were used overseas making them the largest customer for the Contender, Maidstone & District Motor Services were second with 11 buses and one coach.Burrows, 'Ask Geoff' column, in Stenning(ed)Classic Bus 110, London, 2010 Although during its short life the Contender was less successful than Beadle's integral coaches, Beadle's comparable Chatham range were by 1957 almost their only line and when the BET group decided to reduce the number of its recommended suppliers only Southdown's liking for their coach body on the Leyland Tiger Cub kept the Dartford body lines going, but then Southdown switched to Weymann and briefly Burlingham (having taken Harrington Wayfarer Mark Is in small numbers and then deserted Harrington for most of the 1950s) and that was the end of Beadle in the coachwork game. Rootes decided that the car-dealership chain Beadle also ran was a better business. During the life of the Wayfarer all of the mushroom coachbuilding businesses disappeared. The clear number one in coach bodies by 1959 was Duple at Hendon, who by 1954 also had a bus factory in the East Midlands at Kegworth and in 1958 purchased the bus builder Willowbrook in nearby Loughborough. Duple was strong in the lightweight end of the market, being first choice for bodies on the market-leading Bedford but was facing competition in the premium underfloor engined class from Plaxton and HV Burlingham of Blackpool. Like Harringtons, these were primarily builders of coach bodies who also did buses, Burlingham built double as well as single deck vehicles and had a respected if small list of customers for these. Weymann, Roe and Alexander were on the other hand bus builders who also did coaches. Continental inspiration, more new materials During the run of the Wayfarer and the Contender, Harrington's coachbuilders developed expertise in handling increasingly large and complex glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) mouldings. The management were keeping abreast of European trends in design and had formed an especial friendship with their opposite numbers at the Italian firm of Orlandi. These changes set the seed for future progress. This combination of alloy frame, mainly aluminium panelling and GRP for coachwork features requiring complex compound curvature enabled stronger, lighter and more durable coach bodies. Besides Harrington, Alexander, ECW, Yeates of Loughborough and (in 1954-56) Park Royal were going down this route. The development of durable laminates for interior panel finish such as wareite and formica was another feature that Harrington started to pioneer. A belated change to the construction and use rules in 1957 allowed fixed, rather than opening, driver's windscreens on public service vehicle (PSV) bodies. This, together with advances in toughened glass manufacture, at last made it possible to have a coach windscreen with a three-dimensional curvature. Early examples of this by Duple, Plaxton and (particularly) Burlingham on the Bedford, Commer and Ford Thames 300E lightweight coaches from 1958 were apt to be 'over the top' echoing similar goldfish-bowl windscreens on large saloon cars by the US-owned carmakers such as the Vauxhall Cresta PA. Harrington did not slavishly adopt, it considered, the next design from Old Shoreham Road retained flat-glazed (optionally-opening) windscreens. The Crusader, classic times ahead Until 1957 Harrington designs for lightweight coaches such as the Bedford SB and the Commer Avenger had been unnamed, but in 1958 the Crusader was launched, it used large glass-fibre mouldings for the front and rear panels. It was slightly ungainly in its original form, but the Mark 2 was a fine looking vehicle, updated as Mark 3 with larger, Cavalier-sized side and rear windows. The final Mark 4 was perhaps a retrograde step, but no worse than equivalent Plaxton or Duple offerings of the time. It was built on the above two chassis and the Ford Thames 570E, customers included Northern General Transport Company,RL Kell, Glory Days Northern General, Hersham 2002 Garelochhead Coach Service and Southdown, who took a batch of 15 Commers in 1960.Booth (ed), Classic Bus 42, Edinburgh, July 1999 The Crusader was the only classic-era Harrington coach body to be purchased new by the state-owned operators, Transport Holding Company subsidiary Thames Valley Traction taking a small batch of Mark 4 on Bedford SBs for its South Midland coaching operation in 1964. Although that same year Wilts & Dorset took over Silver Star, adding Wayfarers and Cavaliers to its coach fleet. Barton Transport's 20 Grenadier-bodied Reliances are justly famous, but they also took 15 Crusader 3 on Bedford SB5, 1011-25 (BVO11-25C). The cars Sunbeam Alpine When Rootes Group entered the two-seat sports car market in 1959 with the Sunbeam Alpine some customers complained to the dealers that unlike some rival makes such as MG and Jaguar there was not a hardtop coup√© version, Thomas Harrington were a Rootes dealer and had more expertise than remaining full Rootes subsidiaries in the use of GRP moulding techniques and thus produced these for sale through selected Rootes dealerships. The first in this series had a molded fastback roof that resulted in a shortened boot lid, resembling a scaled-down Aston Martin. This was known as the Harrington Alpine, later called the A Type Harrington, with the Sunbeam name notably omitted in the Harrington conversions. In 1961, 3000RW was prepared in Seacrest Green for competition at the 24 Hours of Le Mans by the Rootes Works department with aluminum boot, door and bonnet panels and fared-in headlamps. Driven by Peter Harper and Peter Procter, this car beat a works-prepared Porsche to win the Index of Thermal Efficiency, a prestigious award which at the time brought more prize money than second place overall. There were four iterations of Harringtons built on the Alpine platform from 1961 to 1964. With 110 Harrington Alpines built, most on order but some as retrofit conversions, Rootes switched in late 1961 to an edition commemorating Harrington's LeMans achievement. Almost all Harrington Alpines were RHD made for the home market, while most of the 250 LeMans models were exported to the United States. During the production of Harrington models, Sunbeam cosmetically modified the platform. The Series IV Alpine was released in 1964, updated with lower fins and more trunk space. C and D Type Harringtons were limited production models, with 10-12 and 2-4 made respectively, built on the Series IV platform. There is an unconfirmed rumor that a single Harrington Tiger was built as a \\"nooner\\", bringing the total Sunbeam-based Harrington count to a maximum of 375personal conversation with Clive Harrington. Where the LeMans model had fins bobbed to meet the fiberglass LeMans roof and three horizontal taillights, the later iterations returned to a bolt-on roof, leaving the Alpine fin line and lights undisturbed. The D Type had the best access for rear storage, with a side opening hatch similar to the contemporaneous Jaguar E-Type. Three stages of engine tune were offered by Hartwell's, another Rootes affiliate, leading to a petite Grand Tourer capable of just over 100 mph. Harringtons also did a similar conversion to the Triumph TR4 for Wimbledon based Dove Garages. This was called the Dov√© GTR4. The success of the Alpine programme including an encouraging performance at Le Mans led Commer to entrust Harrington with the PSV conversion of the 1500 van, which included a complete one piece fibreglass roof panel of clerestory outline. The Cavalier: compared to its competitors Launched at the end of 1959, the Cavalier was ahead of the opposition in many if not all respects. Certainly its outside appearance was of classic beauty combining curves, sharp angles and peaks in harmony, which combined with understated use of bright trim in a way that made it stand out from the opposition by combining style with good taste, the double curvature windscreen was not only wholly in line with the style of the body but it helped night-time coach drivers by dispelling interior reflections. The Plaxton Panorama (launched in production guise in 1959) had a basically rather boxlike shape and a very flashy grille, but it did pioneer Smiths Instruments 'jet-vent' forced ventilation system allowing fixed windows and a cleaner side outline. The Duple Britannia (1956, on its third facelift for the 1960 season) had an excessively droopy outline and tiny windows, and was very little different from Duple's gaudy Super Vega/Yeoman/Corinthian for cheap coach chassis. Duple probably didn't care, the Brittania was not where the jam lay. The Duple (Midland) Donington was really just a bus tricked out with more chrome. The Willowbrook Viscount (new for 1960) had puzzling trim lines stopping and starting in the middle of nowhere and an overly-bulky outline whilst the optional reverse-rake rear glass was a feature that was already dated at the time of its launch and today simply looks odd. Alexander sold coaches south of the border to North Western and Barton Transport and had a pair of fairly conservative (though aluminium-alloy framed) designs. The curved-waist style which Barton had taken since 1954 was discontinued in 1959 after its other major customer Western SMT had stopped ordering it, North Western took the straight-waisted variant for most of its coach applications, even taking its first batch of 36 ft (see later) Leopards to this outline. Weymann built its Fanfare design for sale through MCW from 1954 to 1962 without alteration, at the end of its run it was a dated looking body. Roe had during the 1950s a coach renaissance, selling versions of its Dalesman style to independents and company fleets almost exclusively on the AEC Reliance, in 1959 the Dalesman IV had trapezoidal glazing and a straight waistrail; the biggest customer for this style being Black & White Motorways of Cheltenham. The masterly execution of the Cavalier stood out most against Burlingham's Seagull 70, its closest contemporary and a body very similar in construction and basic outline. Comparing the two the Seagull 70s detailing was crude and over-emphasised whereas that of the Cavallier was sharply delineated, making the whole coach look lean and sculpted by comparison with the Burlingham style. Some would say that they summed up the difference between Blackpool and Hove. During that season Duple purchased Burlingham and renamed it Duple (Northern). The Yeates Europa (from 1958, on first facelift for 1960) combined a similarly dumpy volume to the Willowbrook, made in the same town, with deliberately tasteless detailing and riotous paint schemes in a way that operators and passengers either loved or loathed, but it was easily the brashest option. 1960 sales The Cavalier was initially offered at 30 ft long by 8 ft wide to fit any suitable underfloor engined chassis. As was normal with Harrington the previous Wayfarer Mark 4 coach remained available (if requested) for the next couple of years, but it was clear the advantage was with the Cavalier. By the time Lloyds of Nuneaton's 3857UE was shown at the 1960 Commercial Motor Show at Earls Court 68 Cavaliers had been sold to seven BET fleets, ten independents and local charity St Dunstan's Home for the Blind. These were mainly on AEC Reliance, but Charlies Cars of Bournemouth took six Albion Aberdonian, East Yorkshire Motor Services took five on Leyland Tiger Cub and Ellen Smith of Rochdale took the sole Leyland Leopard. The Cavalier was a clear success already, with a number of influential customers well out of Harrington's heartland. Sales were both more geographically widespread and in many cases to customers who had not taken Harrington bodies before. The output from Hendon on equivalent chassis that season was 81. 1961 sales Between January and November 1961, 114 Cavaliers were sold, there were repeat orders for the Cavalier from eight operators including St Dunstan's. Of the six BET operators three were new customers for the style, both of the largest taking Leopards for their most prestigious touring duties. Southdown's first order was for forty bodies and Ribble Motor Services, who had favoured local builder HV Burlingham for the past decade took 35. The largest repeat order was from Northern General who again took ten touring coaches, this time on Leopard, and independents adding further Cavaliers were Abbott of Blackpool, Ellen Smith of Rochdale, Flight of Birmingham and Harris of Greys. The most important new independent customer was Yelloway (a conquest from the Duple group) taking six Reliances. In terms of chassis on which to build Harringtons fortune had definitely swung in the direction of Farington, with 86 Leopards and a Tiger Cub being bodied in contrast with only 26 Reliances, the Albion Aberdonian had been discontinued the previous year, so it would from now on be a straight fight between Lancashire and Middlesex. Duple's 1961 season total for the Brittania on its final facelift was 77, all but five on Reliance. The Donington had got bigger windows and Brittania-like trim but between them the expanded Duple group were building not only the Brittania and the Donington but also the Viscount and the Seagull 70, the differences were not just skin-deep either, all the Duple bodies had steel- reinforced hardwood frames, also Plaxton's structural method, The Loughborough-built Donington and Viscount both used frame-sections made from rolled steel tubes, whilst Burlingham's bodies (like those of Harrington and Yeates) were of jig-built aluminium. Plaxton had refined the Panorama with subtler detailing and inward sloping pillars above the waistrail for the 1961 season. Like Harrington they also offered a more conservative option, in their case an Embassy body with twice as many side windows. A more conservative option definitely wasn't Yeates' style, instead they introduced a more radical one, if the Europa was insufficiently in-your-face they could offer you the Fiesta, now with trapezoid glazing. Yeates was always going to be a minority choice, and as Yeates sold everyone else's coachwork (their core business being dealership) perhaps they wanted it that way. 1961 proved though that on the premium chassis, Harrington was now second only to Plaxton, although Duple vastly outstripped either (and the Burlingham operation they now owned) in the market for lightweight day-trip coaches. During 1961 the legal maximum width and length limits for buses and coaches was relaxed, new maxima were 36 ft by 8 ft 2¬Ωin, to take effect from 1 January 1962. Leyland and AEC had suitable models on the stocks by the end of the year whilst continuing production of the shorter-wheelbase models. These could legally carry a slightly longer body than 30 ft and the first 1962-season Cavalier delivered in December 1961 (a repeat order for Keith Coaches of Aylesbury on Reliance) was the first Cavalier 315, so called because it was 1 ft 5in longer than the previous model which enabled Harrington to fit 43 of its own seats into the coach, rather than the previous maximum of 41. Duple and Plaxton had offered a 43-seat plan within the older length limits, but their seats were a bit skimpier on padding and even so came close to infringing legal minimum length requirements. During 1962 the original Cavalier was still offered as was the Cavalier 36, to the new maximum length. The 315 carried most of its extra length in a longer first side window, whilst the 36 ft version had this plus an extra shallower window just aft of the first bay which unlike the rest of the side glazing had a horizontal lower edge, the waistrail now resuming its dip at the third bay, this saved on the cost of extra tooling and made the Cavalier a truly modular range of coach bodies although it certainly did not look that way, the longer first bay window, to the same depth as the windscreen and with a forward sloping pillar made the front of the 315 coach look better balanced. Although the longer version was not as happy as the extended Panorama, tending to look slightly 'droopy' it neither looked as fussy as Blackpool's Continental, or Addlestone's Castillian nor was it quite as distracting as the Europa or Fiesta at the new length. Harrington's cleverness in construction was necessary for as well as three variants of the Cavalier Old Shoreham Road had to find space for car and minibus conversion work, production of Mark 2 Crusader and bus bodies on AEC Reliance and Albion Nimbus chassis. It was perhaps good news that Maidstone and District had finally been weaned off the Wayfarer Mark 4 and that model could be buried after a good innings. Still the end of the Wayfarer Mark 4 meant that the less timid customers would be wanting something more up to date than even the revised Cavalier Also plans came from Luton for a Bedford chassis for the new maximum length market sector; this was going to be radical in concept and not suitable to the Cavalier outline, nor that of any Cavalier Mark 2, still less would it suit an extended Crusader, so not only was the factory floor busy so were the designers in the drawing office. 1962 sales In its final year the 30 foot Cavalier sold 17, all on Reliance. Maidstone & District took ten, South Wales two and Trent Motor Traction, another BET subsidiary, took five, one of which was a replacement body on an accident-salvaged chassis built in 1958. 13 of the 31 ft 5in version were sold, all to existing customers. In the BET group Southdown took 3 more Leopards, Greenslades had three Reliances and Thomas Brothers of Port Talbot added a further Reliance; of the independents Gliderways took another Tiger Cub, Keith of Aylesbury, Harris of Greys and Summerbees of Southampton took more Reliances. A further Reliance was sold to Stanley Hughes, the Bradford dealer, who leased it for the 1962 season to Wallace Arnold of Leeds. As well as these 30 short Cavaliers a further 26 of the 36 foot model were sold. Harrington also sold-off RNJ900, the original Cavalier demonstrator, replacing it with a 36-foot Reliance 470 registered VPM898, which in turn was sold in 1964 to Hall Bros of South Shields. There were two different sorts of long AEC Reliance, the 470 (type 4MU) used the 7.68-litre engine of the shorter version, at a peak rating of 130 bhp, whilst the 590 (type 2U) used a 9.6-litre 140 bhp engine as in the export AEC Regal VI chassis. Southdown chose two 49 seater Leopards to the new length, whilst Greenslades added to its collection of Cavaliers with three Reliance 590s and a new BET customer was Neath and Cardiff Coaches with two long Reliance 470s, seating the maximum 51. The independent buyers of the Cavalier 36 in its first season placing repeat orders for the style were Abbot, Ellen Smith, Yelloway and Hawkey of Newquay and new Cavalier customers included Grey-Green, Hudson of Horncastle, Ayres of Dover, Liss & District in Hampshire and Straws of Leicester, formerly a Plaxton loyalist. Grey-Green had its first 36-foot Cavalier on express service a month after the length was legal. The benefits of longer coaches were clearer for express services than for tours, especically tours to more remote scenic areas. Yelloway's 36 footers had an option peculiar to the operator of additional destination displays over the second and fourth nearside windows. For express work there was also an optional destination box in the roof dome, as well as Yelloway Motor Services, Grey Green were among the operators who specified this. Fifty-seven Cavaliers sold new was exactly half the 1961 performance but the coach market was in a downturn, in comparison Duple sold only nineteen Britannias on short Reliances and four on short Leopard, two of the AECs and one Leopard had old-fashioned central entrances. Blackpool built no further Seagull 70s but built 27 of its 36 ft Duple (Northern) Continental on Reliances, 12 on Leopard (including six for Ribble) and one Leyland Royal Tiger Worldmaster (a cancelled export order) for Happiways of Manchester. 1963 sales In the 1963 season the Cavalier faced internal competition from the Grenadier (see below) but 21 of the 31 ft 5in version and 49 of the 36 ft were sold. Existing customers who placed repeat orders for the short Cavalier were Southdown (4 Leopard L2), Greenslades (another Reliance), Grey Green's orders included a short Reliance and ten Leopard L2 and Harris of Greys, Summerbee of Southampton and McIntyre of Aberdeen all took further Reliances, Harris' being a rebody of a 1958 chassis damaged in an accident. New customers for the 31 ft 5in Cavalier were Munden of Bristol (Leopard L2) and Crump of Pinner (Reliance). A new option was fixed side glazing and forced ventilation. Southdown having this on its Leopards. All but one of the BET customers for the long Cavalier had taken the style before, Neath and Cardiff had two Reliance 470 and East Yorkshire four Leopard PSU3, Ribble had 22 on Leopard PSU3 with the new forced ventilation option, the other three were for a newly acquired Ribble subsidiary, Scout Motor Services of Preston, to the same specification as the Ribble examples. Grey Green had one Leopard PSU3 and one Reliance 470, the latter with forced ventilation. The other repeat orders from independents were from Yelloway who took 5 Reliance 590 with the jet-vent system, as well as the additional side destination screens and Ellen Smith, also of Rochdale, with a Leopard fitted with 45 reclining seats, Yelloway standardising on this luxurious option on its Reliances, the short ones seating only 37 as a result. New purchasers of the Cavalier 36 in its second season were Anglo-Continental of Tunbridge Wells (5 Reliance 590) Valliant of Ealing (4 Reliance 590) and Regent of Redditch with a single Reliance 590. In 1963 Duple had three new styles for underfloor- engined chassis, the Alpine Continental was a longer-windowed version of the Continental whilst the Dragonfly was a 36 ft central entrance coach, both were built at Blackpool, the latter having a steel reinforced hardwood body frame. For the shorter AECs and Leylands the Britannia was finally replaced by the Hendon-built Commodore, which was a modification of the mass market Bella Vista body being 1 ft 10in longer with a front entrance and a maximum capacity of 45. Total Continental/Alpine Continental sales were 17, while only six Dragonflies were built, two Leyland demonstrators on Leopard and four for BET coach operator Samuelson of Victoria. The Commodore was also a sales disappointment, eight Reliance and three Leopard L2 being sold. Willowbrook however were gaining express-coach orders for its version of the BET-standard single decker. In coach form four main bays were fitted as was fixed glazing and forced ventilation and there was an optional solid coach door and brighwork grille. Marshall and Weymann also built BET style express coaches. In contrast Plaxton had a further revised Panorama, with barely perceptible waist curvature and only three main side window bays on the 36 ft body, the dome was refined and thinner trim strips were used producing a body of unusual restraint for a Plaxton, it was an instant sales success. Ribble, for one, placing large orders. Another competitive body was Alexander Y Type, first shown in 1961, which in coach form had four trapezoid windows on each straight-waisted side and double curvature glazing front and rear. As well as selling massively to the Scottish Bus Group, BET fleets who took the style from 1962/63 were North Western and East Midland, followed in later seasons by Trent, Potteries, the Northern General Group, Hebble, Yorkshire Traction, Yorkshire Woolen and Stratford Blue, whilst three independents purchased the style over its lifetime, Scottish co-operative Wholsale Society had four Reliances, Venture of Consett took 12 Reliances and 26 Leopards, with eight more on order when Northern took them over, whilst Premier Travel of Cambridge had sixteen on Reliance. BET favoured steel-tube body framing and, as introduced, the Y type featured this Alexanders reverting to aluminum framework from 1972/73. 1964/65 sales and totals The 1964 season short Cavaliers for BET fleets Greenslades (10 Reliance) and Devon General Grey Cars (8 Reliance) were notable in being to 7 ft 6in width and having Grenadier style dash panels. Grey-Green took eleven, Leopard L2, Crump of Pinner took another Reliance and Hutchings & Cornelius with one Reliance became the last new customer for the Cavalier. 31 of the short version were built in its final season. There were eleven of the longer version, six were for Yelloway on Reliance 590, Grey Green took four Leopard PSU3, Valliant of Ealing had two Reliance 590 and Ellen Smith took a 49-seat Leopard PSU3. The only BET customer was Thomas Brothers of Port Talbot with a 49-seat Reliance 470. In 1965 Yelloway took the last six 36-foot Cavaliers on Reliance 590. In all 359 Cavaliers had been built, one 30 ft demonstrator, one 36 ft and 357 coaches sold of which 199 were 30 ft, 65 31 ft 5in and 93 36 ft. There were 99 30 ft Cavaliers sold (plus a demonstrator) on AEC Reliance 2MU chassis, 87 on Leyland Leopard L2T, seven on Leyland Tiger Cub PSUC1/2T and six on Albion Aberdonian MR11L. Cavalier 315 sales totalled 37 Reliances and 28 Leopards. Cavalier 36 sales comprised 39 Leopard PSU3, 52 Reliance 590 (2U) and 13 Reliance 470 (4MU) plus the demonstrator, which was sold after a year to Hall Bros. of South Shields who became a loyal Grenadier customer. The Grenadier, an apotheosis To supplement the Cavalier for the 1963 season the Grenadier was introduced, initially available on the longer chassis it was outwardly similar but a tauter-looking body, the structure was similar but the glazing was revised employing one fewer window per side and dipping less toward the rear. A larger windscreen was fitted with a more prominent peak, only the rear glass was carried over from the Cavalier. Revised front and rear GRP mouldings were employed, that at the front accenting the horizontal and carrying a larger destination box, that at the rear having horizontal rather than vertical light clusters. The forced-ventilation set up was standard, intakes for it being fitted in the front peak rather than in Plaxton-style air-scoops on the roof, these changes adding further to the cleanliness of line, the bright trim was of a similar layout to that of the Cavalier, the skirt mouldings being carried over virtually unchanged. Although roof quarter glazing was a common option on Cavaliers the less rounded roof-line of the Grenadier ensured Grenadiers with this option were rare. 1963 sales The first two Grenadiers were a Reliance 590 for Harris of Greys and a Leopard PSU3 for Grey-Green, both of which were shown at the 1962 Earls Court Commercial Motor show. In the initial season a further 36 ft Reliance 590 went to Abbott of Blackpool, two Leopards to Gliderways of Smethwick, five to Northern General (the only BET order) and a unique 33 ft Grenadier went to Hawkey of Newquay on a Reliance 590 with specially reduced front and rear overhangs, it was registered 900SAF and sat 47. 1964 sales For the 1964 season a 31 ft 10in option for the shorter chassis was introduced. 39 of these went to six BET companies and seven independents, previous Harrington customers were North Western, Southdown, Trent and Timpson of Catford. Southdown specified the dash panels of the Cavalier on their batch. The return of North Western was maybe a surprise as they were a major supporter of the 11m Alexander Y Type, but they obviously wanted something shorter (and a bit classier) for their extended tours, their two Leopard L2 had illuminated offside and nearside name badges under the second bay. The two new BET customers were Western Welsh and Black & White Motorways of Cheltenham, both taking short Reliances. Straw of Leicester had previously taken the Cavalier and specified a Cavalier dash on its Reliance, conquest sales for the short Grenadier in the independent sector were to Jones of Aberbeeg, Birch Brothers and Motorways Overseas, both of London, Roman City of Bath and Wye Valley of Hereford; the first three operators took Reliances and the latter two Tiger Cubs, Roman City's was a rebodied 1954 ex-Ribble coach whilst Wye Valley's two new examples had 45 coach seats, not possible using Harrington seats, so Plaxton seats were purchased and fitted. For the long Grenadier there was only one BET purchaser, Maidstone & District taking five Reliance 590. BOAC took two of the same for its Glasgow-Prestwick Airport service. The independent buyers were Abbott of Blackpool, Barton Transport, Bermuda of Nuneaton, Gliderways, Hall Brothers of South Shields, Jones, Keith of Aylesbury and Motorways Overseas. Of the 32 built 5 were on Leopards. All 27 Reliances were of the 590 type, Bartons 979-988 (979-88 VRR) having Cavalier type windscreens and a roof mounted destination box as well as air operation for the coach door, enabling use as a bus. Hall Bros had an illuminated name badges on the nearside under the first bay on its three Leopards and sole Reliance 590. This was the final year of the dateless registration plate system and two classics were on Grenadier-bodied Reliances, Keith Coaches had 1234PP whilst the first of Maidstone & District‚Äôs carried 3294D. A change to legal regulations to come into effect from 1965 required additional emergency exits on bodies seating more than 45, on the Grenadier 36 the offside first bay, just aft of the drivers window, was to be fitted with a top-hinged exit door for its final two seasons. 1965 Southdown headed the BET list for short Grenadiers taking another ten to its style on Leopard L2, North Western had a further three L2 and Samuleson of Victoria (their garage is now the Arrivals terminal for Victoria Coach Station) took four L2, the other BET purchasers chose the Reliance, Timpson of Catford taking four and their subsidiary Bourne & Balmer of Croydon taking two. Private sector customers were, on Leopard, Grey Green (4) and Jones, Aberbeeg (1), Ekcersley of St Helens took a Grenadier body on a reconditioned 1954 Tiger Cub chassis whilst Gliderways had two new Tiger Cubs, the rest were on Reliance, Bowen of Birmingham had three, and one each went to the following: Green Luxury, Walton-on-Thames, Harris of Greys, Hutchings & Cornelius, South Petherton, Rickard of Brentford and Warburton of Bury The sole BET customer for the 36-foot Grenadier was Black & White Motorways of Cheltenham, taking five Leopard PSU3. Private-sector Leopard buyers were Hall Bros, South Shields (4), Laceys of West Ham (1, the 1964 show coach) and Ellen Smith (1). The Reliance list was headed by Barton Transport whose 1001-10 featured a destination box below the windscreen in lieu of the illuminated name badge, allowing the fitment of a standard Grenadier windscreen but they retained the power doors, they were registered BVO1-10C and featured Reliance 4U3RA air-suspended chassis, a very rare option on the home market; the only other air-sprung chassis to receive Harrington bodies were the initial Ribble and Southdown batches of Cavalier bodied Leopard L2T. Steel-sprung Reliance 590s went to Valliant of Ealing (four with top-sliding windows in lieu of forced vents), Motorways Overseas, London, Surrey Motors of Sutton (3 each), Regent of Redditch (2), Beavis of Bussage, Gloucestershire (one), Bermuda of Nuneaton (one) and Hawkey of Newquay (one). The 1965 sales list also included a 51-seat Reliance 470 for Hutchings and Cornelius. 1966, The Swansong Closure had been announced at the time of delivery of the 1966 examples, there was one batch at 31 ft 10in comprising four Reliances for Greenslades. The 36-footers comprised 15 Reliance 590 for Maidstone & District, 8 with top sliders for Devon General's Grey Cars operation and a final six Leopard PSU3 for Grey-Green. Greenslades FFJ13D was shown in a valedictory appearance for Harringtons at the 1966 Brighton Coach Rally. It bore plaques proclaiming it the final Harrington body built. Grenadier totals 192 Grenadiers were built, one to 33 ft length, 82 to 31 ft 10in and 109 to 36 ft. Two of the shortest versions were on rebodied Leyland Tiger Cub, and four on new Leyland Tiger Cub PSUC1/12T chassis, 34 on Leyland Leopard L2T, the remaining 42 on short-wheelbase AEC Reliance 470 2MU3RA. Of the 109 to 36-foot length, eleven were built in 1963, seventy-one in 1964, seventy-seven in 1965 and 33 in 1966. Of those, one was a Reliance 470 4MU3RA, 68 were Reliance 590 2U3RA and ten were air-sprung Reliance 4U3RA, the total on Leyland Leopard PSU3 was 30. The sole 33 ft version was on a modified Reliance 2U3RA. The Legionnaire Bakers Dolphin Harrington Legionnaire bodied Bedford VAL During 1961 Vauxhall Motors told British coachbuilders about its new design to be produced from the end of 1962. The Bedford VAL was a twin-steering chassis with a long front overhang designed for an entrance ahead of the steering axles, a unique feature of the type was that the wheels were only 16-inch in diameter, which in turn reduced the floor height of bodied examples, the radiator was mounted at the front and immediately behind it was the 125 bhp Leyland O.400 engine. The Harrington Legionnaire was a square-rigged body with straight waistrail and five deep windows per side, one less than the Duple Vega Major and one more than the Plaxton Val. It also differed from the Cavalier and Grenadier by having plated window surrounds, there was a large brightwork grille and twin headlights, a Grenadier style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear. Above the windscreen was a destination box or illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak. At the rear the illuminated nameboard was inside the rear glass and this was fitted the other way about to the front, meaning the first and last pillars had a pronounced forward rake to them whilst all the others were vertical. The Cantrail was flat above it was a roof section of very shallow curvature. The mark two which followed in 1964 for the final two seasons omitted this flat cantrail and had a roof of compound curvature, which reduced the tall square effect of the original but reduced space in the overhead luggage racks. The Legionnaire was built on the Bedford VAL, the more conventional Ford Thames 36 and there were also two specials on Guy Victory trambus chassis. The Legionnaire took its fame from the 1969 film The Italian Job. The ending of the film involves a Mark II Legionnaire (ALR 453B) hanging over a cliff in the Alps, as the driver had taken the coach into a skid and lost control. A remake model can be seen at the De La Warr Pavilion art gallery. The Harrington Society Many Harrington vehicles, buses, coaches cars and miniature coaches survive, ranging from a late 1920s Leyland to Cavaliers, Grenadiers and five Legionnaires, one of which is a replica of the Italian Job coach. Every five years the Harrington Society hold a gathering at the Amberly Museum to celebrate the coachbuilder and its products. The last gathering was in 2012 and was attended by Roy Harrington, Clive Harrington, Anne Hanrahan ( n√©e Harrington ), Michael Harrington and Christine Harrington. Many cherished examples of the marque, both cars and coaches, were on display.

It is filmed in Brisbane's Channel 9 studio on Mount Coot-tha, Queensland. Gameplay The challenges on the show are born from science experiments, such as guessing how many drops of water will fit on a twenty cent coin. Each episode's final challenge, The Labyrinth, features the children competitors racing through a series of physical and mental challenges. The 1st pair to make it through the labyrinth gets cheesed at the end. This is similar in style to the maze on early 1990s Australian kids game show A*mazing and 1990s American show Legends of the Hidden Temple. Rounds * Nano Challenge - In this round, both teams simultaneously try and complete the challenge and achieve their goal. If they succeed, the team wins 10 points. Its time limit is unlimited. It could be a minute, half a minute or even two. * What'll Happen If - In this round, Drew and Nicole will describe the experiment and both teams, in private must make a hypothesis/guess as to what will happen. After both teams guesses are made, Drew and Nicole will perform the experiment. If their guess is right, the team wins 5 points. * Method Madness - In this round, teams perform the task either simultaneously or one at a time. If the task is to be performed one team at a time, the trailing team will decide whether to go first or second. If there is a tie, the Randomizer will then be done to find the winning team. Whoever goes second will get shrunk by Drew and surrounded by a metal cage with a cat on guard to prevent them from seeing their opposing team in action. Teams will perform a task. The winning team gets 15 points. Another common form of 'shrinking' in Method Madness, is where they 'lose' your heads, through the use of CGI. In the 2012 version, the trailing team got to perform the challenge first and the leading team had their heads relocated. * Rat Race - This is a race to completing the game. Whoever wins, gets 30 points. Along the way, status accelerators are on offer with 20, 15, 10 and 5 points. Obstacles include wire traps, cargo nets, dark room (where the exit is on the ground), slide, ball pits, maze and Cheese Dump. Every episode has a major challenge where teams have to do a task such as filling a cylinder to the line, building a skeleton or operating a crane. In the 2012 version, as well as trying to find the exit to the dark room, teams have to find an eyeball before leaving the dark room. Teams could also intentionally just exit the dark room without finding the eyeball in order to save up time in the race. By doing so, the team wasn't eligible to gain any status accelerator points. At the cargo net, contestants have to climb up two sets and crawl over the ground. After that they slide down a slide and get the status accelerators. After finishing the major task comes the maze which they have to make their way through the correct doors. If there is a tie after What'll Happen If or the Rat Race, there is a tie breaker known as the Randomizer. Both teams are given a beaker of water along with two similar-looking containers of white powder. Only one would cause a chemical reaction when placed in the water. The team that wins the Rat Race gets to choose their powder first. Both teams pour their powder in the water and the one that has a chemical reaction wins. This tie breaker is completely based on chance. Sounds boring, but there is one episode which has a sample Randomizer with white powder. More excitingly, there is one episode which has TWO Randomizers. It happened as both teams scored 15-15 and 65-65. This was in Series 1 Episode 20. International broadcasts * In the United Kingdom, Lab Rats Challenge was screened on POP and Kix (until December 2012, and was replaced by Scaredy Squirrel in January 2013); at around the same time CBBC began airing a similar UK-produced format, Richard Hammond's Blast Lab. * In Singapore, the series is screened on Okto and Channel 5.

It is a Leopard hunt game (or Leopard game). One tiger is going up against seven leopards. The leopards attempt to surround and trap the tiger while the tiger attempts to capture enough of them so that the leopards can not trap it. The game was originally documented as Hatdiviyan or \\"Seven Leopards\\" by Leopold Ludovici in The Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (1873), and specifically in the chapter entitled The Sports and Games of the Singhalese which he wrote himself, he provides a written description of the game and an illustration. The game was then documented by Henry Parker as Hat diviyan keliya in his work Ancient Ceylon: An Account of the Aborigines and of Part of the Early Civilisation (1909), and he transcribed its name as The Game of the Seven Leopards. Parker provides a written description of the game, but not a diagram. He does however reference Ludovici as a source for the game which included a diagram. Parker actually misspells Ludovici's last name as Ludovisi. The game is also described by the Czech language website Klub p≈ô√°tel deskov√Ωch her which refers to it as Sedm pard√°l≈Ø which when translated into English means seven panthers (or seven leopards), and references Milo≈° Zapletal work ≈†pal√≠ƒçek her (1988). The website describes two variants of the game, the one described by Ludovici and Parker and another one with a slightly larger board (consisting of an extra row of three intersection points) with two tigers and eight leopards. There may be a very similar game played in Thailand called Len Choa played with six leopards, but as there was no illustration of the board provided in the original documentation of Len Choa, and the written description of Len Choa is vague, it is therefore uncertain if the boards are the same. The following setup and rules are based upon Leopold Ludovici's description of the game.  Setup  The board consist of an isosceles triangle with two parallel lines running across its breadth, and one line running down its length from the apex to the midpoint of the base. This makes for 10 intersection points (here-in-forth referred to as \\"points\\"). There are seven pieces representing the leopards, and one piece representing the tiger. Leopard and tiger pieces should be distinguishable from one another by color or design. Players decide what animal to play. The board is empty.  Rules  * Players alternate their turns throughout the game. * The tiger player moves first, and may place the sole tiger piece on any point on the board.Ludovici writes that it is often placed on the apex of the triangle as it is the most advantageous position. * The leopard player must drop all seven leopard pieces first before any of them can be moved on the board. Only one leopard piece may be dropped per turn, and they are dropped onto any vacant point on the board. * The tiger player on its turn may either move the tiger along a line onto a vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board, or attempt to capture a leopard. * After all seven leopard pieces have been dropped, the leopard player for the remainder of the game may move one of its pieces onto an adjacent vacant point following the pattern on the board. Leopards can not capture, nor perform any leaps over the tiger or fellow leopards. * The tiger captures a leopard by the short leap as in draughts. The tiger must be adjacent to the leopard, and leap over it (in a straight line) onto a vacant point immediately beyond following the pattern on the board. The captured piece is removed from the board. Only one capture is allowed per turn. Captures are not compulsory. * Leopards win if they trap the one tiger. That is, the tiger can not move on its turn. The tiger wins if it captures enough leopards where they can no longer effectively block the tiger's movements.

Dairy Goat Journal. Accessed August 14, 2008. In India there were an estimated 580,000 of the breed in the 1972 census, although less than 5000 were thought to be purebred.  Physical characteristics  There is a large variation in color but the typical Jamnapari is white with patches of tan on the neck and head. Their heads tend to have a highly convex nose, which gives them a parrot-like appearance. They have long flat drooping ears which are around 25 cm long. Both sexes have horns. The udder has round, conical teats and is well developed. They also have unusually long legs.Shelton, Maurice (1978). \\"Reproduction and Breeding of Goats\\". The Jamnapari male can weigh up to 120 kg, while females can reach around 90 kg. The average lactation yield per day has been found to be slightly less than two kilograms. Jamnapari meat is said to be low in cholesterol.Wariman, Noor H. \\"Jihad Ternak Planning To Export Jamnapari Goats\\". Accessed August 13, 2008.  Behavior  During the winter they spend more than 90% of their time grazing, although this falls to around 55% in the hot Indian summer. The breed browses on bushes, tree leaves and the top of grasses rather than typical ground grazing. Their mean heart rate was found to be 127 ¬± 3.46 in one study.N. H. Mohan1, D. Niyogi2, H. N.

The abbreviated form  The abbreviated Thiruman is more commonly used by Iyengars in daily life. It consists of a single thin, vertical red or yellow line in the middle of the forehead. Although the Smriti forbid wearing the Srichurnam without the Thiruman, it has become a common practice due to convenience. Etymology and meaning The Parashara Smriti gives a very detailed explanation on the Thiruman: where, when, and how to wear it, as well as what should be chanted while wearing the same. Srichurnam is the yellow/red line in the middle of the white marks. The white marks are called Thiruman in Tamil. The word Srichurnam is often referred with the Thiruman and is called as Thiruman Srichurnam (or Oordhva Pundram). Particularly for the followers of Sri Sampradayam Srivaishnavas, Sriman Narayana (Vishnu) is always seen as being inseparable from his divine consort, Lakshmi, and hence the marks on The etymology of Srichurnam is as follows: Sri refers to Lakshmi, while churanam literally means powder. The Srichurnam - the red/yellow line in the middle - represents Lakshmi. Thiruman (tiru = holy, man = clay) represents the feet Vishnu. Composition Apart from the main ingredients described below, several auspicious substances are added, such as Tulasi, rice, turmeric, camphor, flowers. Thiruman The white powder in Thiruman is derived from decayed schistose mica. It is found, among other places, in Melukote.

It is a hunt game, and since it uses a triangle board, Demala diviyan keliya is specifically a leopard hunt game (or leopard game). Three leopards are going up against fifteen dogs. The dogs attempt to surround and trap the leopards while the leopards attempt to capture enough of them in order to foil their objective. It is unknown how old the game is, but the game was described by H. Parker in his 1909 book Ancient Ceylon: An Account of the Aborigines and of Part of the Early Civilisation. The game is also known as the Tamil leopards' game. The game is well known in Southern India, and its Hindustani name is RafƒÅya.  Setup  The board consist of an isosceles triangle where two additional line segments run from the apex of the triangle down to its base thus dividing the triangle into four triangular compartments. In addition, a rectangle intersects the triangle breadth-wise. The rectangle itself is divided into two rectangles as a line segment runs across its breadth. This makes a board with 21 intersection points (hereforth called \\"points\\"). There are fifteen dog pieces and three leopard pieces. The dog pieces should be distinguishable from the leopard pieces. Players decide who will play the Leopards and who will play the Dogs. Henry Parker does not describe if the board is empty in the beginning or if the three leopard pieces are entered one piece at a time or if all three are already placed on the board and exactly how and where they are placed. Parker only states that the game is played in the same way as in Hat diviyan keliya which is also a leopard game played in Sri Lanka but with less pieces and points on the board. In Hat Diviyan Keliya, the single tiger piece is comparable to the three leopard pieces in Demala diviyan keliya as they are the side that can perform captures, and the single tiger piece is placed on the apex of the triangle board. The fifteen dog pieces are set beside the board.  Rules  *Players alternate their turns throughout the game. *The Dogs on its turn may drop one of its pieces onto any vacant point on the board, and only one in a turn. All fifteen dog pieces must be dropped first before any of them may be moved. *Assuming all three leopard pieces are already on the board, the Leopards on its turn may either move one of its pieces onto a vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board, or capture a dog piece by the short leap. In capturing a dog by the short leap, the leopard must be adjacent to the dog, and leap over it (in a straight line and following the pattern of the board) landing on a vacant point immediately beyond.Henry Parker writes \\"Capturing the Dogs is termed 'chopping' them (v. kotanawƒÅ)\\" The captured dog piece is removed from the board. Only one capture is allowed in a turn. Captures are not compulsory. *After all the dog pieces have been dropped, the Dogs may move one of its pieces onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board. Unlike the Leopards, the Dogs cannot perform a capture. *The Dogs win if they surround and trap the three leopards. That is, the Leopards cannot move or capture on their turn. The Leopards win if they capture enough dogs making it impossible for them to be trapped.

Losurdo's philosophical-political reflection, attentive to the contextualization of philosophical thought in his own historical time, moved in particular from the themes of radical criticism of liberalism, capitalism and colonialism as well as the traditional conception of totalitarianism in the perspective of a defense of Marxist dialectics and historical materialism, devoting himself to the study of anti-revisionism in the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist sphere. Losurdo included his works in the history of ideas and concerned the investigation of questions of contemporary history and politics, with a constant critical attention to historical revisionism and the controversy against the interpretations of Hannah Arendt, Fran√ßois Furet, Karl Popper and Ernst Nolte. In particular, Losurdo has criticised a reactionary tendency among contemporary revisionist historians such as Nolte (who traced the impetus behind the Holocaust to the excesses of the Russian Revolution) and Furet (who linked the Stalinist purges to a \\"disease\\" originating from the French Revolution). According to Losurdo, the intention of these revisionists is to eradicate the revolutionary tradition as their true motivations have little to do with the search for a greater understanding of the past, but rather he claims it lies in both the climate and ideological needs of the political classes and is most evident in the work of the English-speaking imperial revivalists such as Niall Ferguson and Paul Johnson. His 2015 book War and Revolution provided a new perspective on the English, American, French, Russian and anti-colonial revolutions, among others.Losurdo, Domenico (2015). War and Revolution: Rethinking the Twentieth Century. Verso. . Losurdo also turned his attention to the political history of modern German philosophy from Kant to Karl Marx and the debate that developed in Germany in the second half of the 19th and in the 20th century as well as a reinterpretation of the tradition of liberalism, in particular starting from the criticism and accusations of hypocrisy addressed to John Locke for his financial participation in the Atlantic slave trade.Losurdo, Domenico (2003). Dalla teoria della dittatura del proletariato al gulag? (in Italian). In Marx, Karl; Engels, Friedrich. Manifesto del partito comunista. Translation and introduction by Losurdo. Bari: Editori Laterza. p. XL. Taking up what Arendt stated in her 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism, Losurdo argued that the 20th century's true original sin was the colonial empire of the late 19th century, where totalitarianism and the internments manifested for the first time.  Historical revisionism  According to Losurdo, despecification is the exclusion of an individual or group from the civilian community. There are two types of despecification: * Political and moral despecification in which the exclusion is due to political or moral factors. * Naturalistic despecification in which the exclusion is due to biological factors. For Losurdo, the naturalistic despecification is qualitatively worse than the political-moral one. While the latter offers at least one escape through the change of ideology, this is not possible in the case of a naturalistic despecification since it is irreversible as it refers to biological factors that are in themselves unchangeable.Brignoli, Maurizio (1 May 2005). \\"Losurdo, Domenico, Il linguaggio dell'impero. Lessico dell'ideologia\\" (in Italian). Unlike many other thinkers, Losurdo thought that the Holocaust of the Jewish people is not incomparable and therefore was willing to admit in this case a tragic peculiarity. Losurdo stated that the comparisons he offers about this did not want to be a relativisation or a belittlement of the Holocaust, but that to consider the Jewish Holocaust as incomparable meant to lose the historical perspective and to forget about the Black Holocaust (i.e. the genocide of black people) or the American Holocaust (i.e. the genocide of Native Americans in the United States through the continued deportation to the west with the Indian removal and diffusion of smallpox) as well as other mass exterminations such as the Armenian genocide.Losurdo, Domenico (1999). L'ebreo, il nero e l'indio nella storia dell'Occidente (in Italian). Urbino: Quattro venti. Losurdo was a strong critic of the equation between Nazism and communism made by scholars like Fran√ßois Furet and Ernst Nolte, but also by Hannah Arendt and Karl Popper.Losurdo, Domenico (1998). Popper falso profeta (in Italian). Armando Editore. p. 158. Similarly, Losurdo criticised the concept of a Red Holocaust. He argued that in the Nazi concentration camps there was an explicit homicidal intention as the Jew who entered was destined not to get out of it (there is a naturalistic despecification) while in the Gulag there was not (it is political-moral despecification). In the first case, the Nazis imprisoned those whom they regarded and called Untermensch (subhuman) while in the second case (in which he claimed only a part of the dissidents ended up to) dissidents were locked up to be re-educated and not to be killed. Despite being a practice to be condemned, Losurdo stated that \\"the prisoner in the Gulag is a potential \\"comrade\\" [the guard was required to call him this way] [...] and after 1937 [the beginning of the two years long Great Purge following the murder of Sergey Kirov] he is [...] a potential \\"citizen\\".Klinestiver, Matthew. \\"Excerpts from Domenico Losurdo's Stalin: History and Criticism of a Black Legend\\".

The Gulag Archipelago. Paris: √âditions du Seuil. Losurdo maintained that although it was a disgrace that a socialist country born to abolish exploitation retorted to imperialist and capitalist systems and methods, the Gulag was more analogous to many Western concentration camps (whose governments have supported and claim to be champions of freedom) which in some ways were more akin to the Nazi concentration camps as a death camp and not a re-education one, taking up the history of the Indian genocide. He also argued that British concentration camps and penal colonies were worse than any Gulag, accusing politicians such Winston Churchill and Harry S. Truman of being guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity just like‚Äîif not worse‚Äîthose attributed to Joseph Stalin. Losurdo also took a more critical view of Mahatma Gandhi and his nonviolent resistance.Losurdo, Domenico (2010). La non-violenza. Una storia fuori dal mito (in Italian).

Losurdo stated his belief that communists suffer from autophobia (fear of themselves and their own history), a pathological problem that must be faced, unlike healthy self-criticism.Losurdo, Domenico (1999). Fuga dalla storia? Il movimento comunista tra autocritica e autofobia (in Italian). In excerpts from a conference organized in 2003 to re-evaluate the figure of Stalin fifty years after his death, Losurdo harshly criticised the revelations contained in Nikita Khrushchev's \\"Secret Speech\\". According to Losurdo, Stalin's bad reputation derived not from the crimes committed by the latter which he compared to others of his time, but from the falsehoods present in the report that Khrushchev read during the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956. He also gave credit to one of the main accusations that were at the base of the bloody repression against the opponents, i.e. the existence of the \\"full-bodied reality of the fifth column\\" in the Soviet Union ready to ally with the enemy.Giacomini, Ruggero (2005). Stalin nella storia del Novecento (in Italian). Teti Editore. p. 139. Losurdo reiterated that he did not want to rehabilitate Stalin, but only to put him in the historical context and present a more neutral analysis of the facts, implementing a revisionism of the general experience of real socialism,Losurdo, Domenico; Giacomini, Riggero, ed. (1999). URSS: bilancio di un'esperienza. Atti del Convegno italo-russo. Urbino, 25-26-27 settembre 1997. Urbino: Quattro venti. . considered a past yet useful study to understand the future dynamics of socialism.  Work   Liberalism: A Counter-History  In Liberalism: A Counter-History (2005), first published in English in 2011, Losurdo argued that while purporting to emphasise the importance of individual liberty, liberalism has long been marked by its exclusion of people from these rights, resulting in racism, slavery and genocide. Losurdo asserted that the origins of Nazism are to be found in what he views as colonialist and imperialist policies of the Western world. He examined the intellectual and political positions of intellectuals on modernity. In his view, Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel were the greatest thinkers of modernity while Friedrich Nietzsche was its greatest critic.Losurdo, Domenico (2011). Liberalism: A Counter-History. Verso. . It received a number of positive reviews from critics.  Stalin: History and Criticism of A Black Legend  In Stalin: History and Criticism of A Black Legend (2008), Losurdo stimulated a debate about Joseph Stalin, on whom he claimed it is built a kind of black legend intended to discredit all communism. Opposed to the comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, Losurdo criticised the concept of totalitarianism, especially in the works of Hannah Arendt, Fran√ßois Furet, Karl Popper and Ernst Nolte, among others. He argued that totalitarianism was a polysemic concept with origins in Christian theology and that applying it to the political sphere required an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place Nazi Germany and other fascist regimes and the Soviet Union and other socialist states in the dock together, serving the anti-communism of Cold War-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research.Losurdo, Domenico (2014). \\"Towards a Critique of the Category of Totalitarianism\\".

A storm of protests ensued when around twenty editors sent a letter of protest to the editor of the newspaper in which they criticized both Losurdo's attempt at Stalin's rehabilitation in his book and Liguori's review (judged to be too positive with respect to the book) as well as with the choice of the director of the newspaper to publish this review.Liguori, Guido (10 April 2009).

His book also caused controversies internationally, especially in Germany, with critics labelling Losurdo a neo-Stalinist. Losurdo continued to actively cooperate with Furr, introducing him to an Italian publisher who published the Italian translation of Furr's book Khruschev Lied in 2016, with Losurdo's introduction. Additionally, Losurdo wrote a back-cover to Furr's 2013 book The Murder of Sergei Kirov and an introduction to the book which remains unpublished.  Political views  Ideologically a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist, Losurdo supported the interpretation that Mao Zedong gave the plurality to the class struggle by paying attention to the process of female emancipation and colonised peoples.Losurdo, Domenico (25 June 2016). \\"Domenico Losurdo: \\"Una teoria generale del conflitto sociale\\" (in Italian).

It was released by Five Star Production. A prequel to the 2005 film Long khong (Art of the Devil 2), Art of the Devil 3 fills in the back story of Miss Panor, portrayed by Napakpapha Nakprasitte, who turns to black magic to exact revenge upon her tormentors. Plot The film opens with a magician, Dit, torturing his former master and demanding the 'Third Eye', which will make him a full disciple of the Three-Eyed God. The master warns that Dit cannot handle all the black magic he's absorbed. Dit stabs his former master in the forehead and tries to dig out the 3rd Eye, but the old man does not seem to have it, leaving Dit to kill him. Later, Dit is in his hotel room, bathing in reeds and herbs, trying to heal a rotting wound on his stomach, caused by too much black magic devouring him from the inside out. Despite this, the wound festers and grows larger. In a hospital, Aajaan Panor is strapped to a bed in the psychiatric ward, as her nurse and doctor look on. The doctor prescribes a change in medication, claiming that it will not harm Miss Panor's unborn child. The nurse is a woman named Pen, who is Ta's aunt and is also newly pregnant. Pen's husband, Aod, later arrives at the hospital to pick her up, and together they drive to the train station to get Ta. Ten years ago, Panor had tutored both Pen and Ta. Ta's father, Prawase, falls in love with Panor; in order to marry her, he poisons his first wife, Duen. Ta's grandfather and great-grandmother enlist Dit's help to bring Duen back to life by transferring her soul into a new body. Using Ta's blood as a conduit, they encourage him chant the sutra, but he is too nervous, and the ritual fails. In the present day, Ta has returned home to spend some time with his family, and they hope that he will be able to complete the ceremony this time around. The family again hires Dit to help them. Pen takes Panor from the hospital and brings her to the family barn, where Ta's grandfather has preserved Duen's corpse in salt. As the ritual begins, Pen straps Panor into stirrups and removes her foetus. As Panor struggles, Dit sees the 3rd Eye bulging from her forehead, and decides he must get it at all costs. Ta chants the sutra successfully, Panor's soul is torn from her body and trapped in a mirror, and Duen's soul settles into Panor's body. Dit ties a red string around Duen/Panor's wrist and says that it will help attach the old soul to this new body. Aod goes to bury the foetus and mirror at the base of a small shrine, but is spooked by some noises in the jungle and runs off, leaving everything behind. Meanwhile, the 3rd Eye is causing Duen/Panor to experience some creepy visions‚Äîmostly corpses of people slain in the name of black magic. While arguing with some of these invisible creatures, the red string falls off her wrist. Duen/Panor next goes to a secret hut in the jungle where she has tied up her husband, Prawase. She reveals that she is Duen in Panor's body, and accuses him of trying to abandon her. She tortures him by tearing out his toenails. When she leaves the hut, Prawase gets loose and shoots himself in the head. Deep in the jungle, Duen's soul starts to come loose from Panor's body, and she fights with Dit to keep both pieces together. In their struggles, the mirror containing Panor's soul is broken, Duen's soul is evicted, allowing Panor's to return and Dit runs away. At this exact moment, Ta's great-grandmother starts screaming that the family is about to be destroyed by a ghost. In the barn, Panor ties Ta's grandfather to a chair and lays out some black magic accoutrements. Panor then pins his eyes open with safety pins, then rubs salt on them, then claims that she will make the grandfather watch the death of his whole family. Using her black magic (and the extra power of the 3rd Eye), Panor causes Ta's great-grandmother to stab herself in the ear with a metal spike. In the ensuing panic, Aod hears Pen calling for him, and rushes outside to see a vision of her, bleeding. Following the vision to the village windmill, Panor's magic enchants a rope that becomes a noose and encircles his neck. Pen and Ta both arrive and try to save Aod, but they cannot fight the windmill, and Aod is strangled. Back in the barn, Panor instructs the grandfather to call out to Ta and Pen, and proceeds to drip hot wax into his eyes. Pen and Ta come running, but she causes them to lose their way. Panor uses her magic to cause Pen's foetus to swell up and explode out of her body. Ta finds her body and is faced with a vision of Panor, then attempts to attack her with a stick, but it passes through her body. Dit arrives and stabs Panor's spirit with a magic knife, demanding that she gives him the 3rd Eye in the process. Proving too powerful for him, she pushes Dit away and causes his ever-growing stomach wound to completely consume his chest. Ta flees and finally reaches the barn, where his grandfather is sitting at a table with the corpses of his family gathered around him. Panor arrives and captures Ta, then burns off his skin with a blow torch (as seen in the previous film). One last flashback reveals that while Panor was a child, she visited a monk to create a spell that would make any man she encountered become attracted to her as she had been bullied by her classmates for her looks. The film ends with the coda 'One Year Later', and shows Ta meeting his five school friends at the train station, thus beginning Art of the Devil 2.

Unfortunately, the company that ordered her went bankrupt before she was completed, so she was bought by Robert Alfred Colby Cubbin, who spent ¬£30,000 converting her into a yacht under the same name, registered at Douglas, Isle of Man.

Built by Mormons, it connected Salt Lake City to the transcontinental line at Ogden. It has since become part of the Union Pacific Railroad, which operates the line as the Salt Lake Subdivision;Agreement Between Union Pacific Railroad Company and Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, effective February 1, 2000 (includes a list of subdivisions from the first post-merger timetable in 1998) FrontRunner commuter rail tracks were added alongside the UP freight line in 2008. History The company was incorporated in 1869, and completed the line in January 1870. At the time the First Transcontinental Railroad was being built, Brigham Young felt slighted by Union Pacific officials who had decided not to build the railroad through Salt Lake. \\"We want [the railroad] in this city where it belongs,\\" he said on one occasion to the Mormons in Salt Lake, \\"the attempt to carry it in that [north] direction is an insult to the people of this city, for in so doing they have tried to shun us.\\" Consequently, Brigham Young formed his own company, the Utah Central Railroad, in order to connect Salt Lake to the Transcontinental Railroad in Ogden, forty miles to the north. Brigham Young did not attend the grand celebration at Promontory Summit on May 10, 1869, when the two lines crossing the continent met. He did, however, attend the groundbreaking ceremony for the Utah Central Railroad in Ogden held a week later on May 17, 1869 and pitched the first shovel-full of ground to symbolize that construction was officially underway. The following year, Young hammered in the final, commemorative spike, with the words \\"Holiness to the Lord\\" engraved upon it, at a special ceremony to celebrate the Utah Central Railroad's completion. The Mormons were hired to grade the Union Pacific line through Utah during the closing months of the race to complete the transcontinental line. The UP was desperate to push as far westward as possible and collect government loans and land grants. However, UP refused to pay. (At the time, the company was effectively bankrupt). To settle the debt, the UP transferred rails and other supplies plus rolling stock to the Mormons. This provided the material for the Utah Central. See p. 372, Stephen E. Ambrose, \\"Nothing Like It in the World,\\" 2000: \\"... Young bombarded the company headquarters in Boston with demands for payment in full. The UP had no money, but it did have equipment left over and Young was desperate to have a branch line, to be owned and controlled by the Mormons, running from Ogden to Salt Lake City. ... The UP gave the Mormons four thousand tons of iron rail ($480,000), 144 tons of spikes ($20,000), thirty-two tons of bolts ($5,600), four first-class passenger cars ($5,000 each), second-class cars, mail cars, flatcars and boxcars.\\" The Union Pacific Railroad gained control of the Utah Central Railroad in 1878, and in 1881 merged it with the Utah Southern Railroad and Utah Southern Railroad Extension to form the Utah Central Railway, a UP subsidiary that ran south from Ogden to Frisco. That company was subsequently merged with several others in 1889 to form the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway, which was reorganized as the Oregon Short Line Railroad in 1897.Don Strack, UtahRails.net: Union Pacific in Utah, 1868-1899, accessed August 2008 The OSL sold the lines south and west of Salt Lake City to the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad in 1903, but kept the original Utah Central.

Still, the brassy ringlets are taxa similar to E. tyndarus - the Swiss brassy ringlet -, and in many cases certainly close relatives. A notable trait of their genus is an ability to adapt well to cold and somewhat arid habitat, like taiga or regions with alpine climate. Optimal habitat in Eurasia, where most of the brassy ringlets are found, therefore occurs in two distinct belts - in the very north of the continent and in the Alpide belt - in interglacials, and in glacials in one periglacialic belt at lower altitude, in places interrupted by dry wasteland and deserts.Albre et al. (2008) Description Brassy ringlets are mid-sized members of their genus, with a length of 17‚Äì22 mm (roughly two-thirds to one inch). Like their relatives, they have black eyespots on their forewings. The largest eyespots are placed, two on each side, near the wingtip, and have a white dot in the center; they are surrounded by a copper-colored patch that is lighter than the blackish- brown upperwings. In some, a third black spot, much smaller and without the white dot, is present at the opposite end of the reddish patch. The hindwings have no black spots in many, but in some taxa there are a few (2-4 or so) black dots, usually without white in the center, paralleling the outer margin. If hindwing spots are present, they are sometimes surrounded by a lighter brown field like the forewing spots, sometimes not. The wing undersides are cryptically colored, usually in grayish-brown and often with a noticeable band arching through the central hindwing, the rest of which has a silvery sheen which makes these species quite recognizable in flight. The eyespots and the forewing patch surrounding them are found on the forewing undersides also; if a hindwing pattern is present, it may or may not show up on the under hindwings either whole or in parts. The common name derives from the brassy luster of the dark wing uppersides. The valvae have a series of external spines pointing distally, with the first spine pair usually being largest. Evolution While the details are still somewhat conjectural, a quite robust evolutionary scenario has been developed for the brassy ringlet group: As it seems, the origin of this group is perhaps south of the Central Asian or more likely in the Balkans region. Probably around 1 million years ago during the Pre-Pastonian Stage, the original population expanded north. During an interstadial, the southern montane metapopulation and the one to the north which ranged across the Eurasian taiga split. Two major southern populations were established some 800,000-700,000 years ago during the Pastonian Stage, when the habitat belt moved uphill, cutting off gene flow between major mountain ranges. Coincident with the G√ºnz-Mindel interglacial, about 600,000-500,000 years ago some more distinct local populations diverged in the south. Meanwhile, the northern population had been spreading across Europe to the Pyrenees and deep into Siberia. With the ice - which had then been covering much of northern and central Europe - retreating at the end of the Elsterian Stage between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago, the taiga population and their relatives in the mountains of central and western Europe became isolated for good. Finally, at the end of the Riss/Saale glaciation about 130,000 years ago, Alpine and Siberian populations fragmented further. The former stayed rather distinct while more subsequent gene flow occurred between the latter; this difference is probably an effect of habitat topography. A peculiar case is the Colorado alpine, the nominate subspecies of Erebia callias. This isolated Rocky Mountains population has been lumped with the Siberian brassy ringlets as they are almost alike morphologically. Though one might suspect stronger differentiation and perhaps marked cryptic speciation across the wide range, the Rocky Mountains population is apparently a very recent isolate. Its ancestors apparently crossed over the Bering Strait at the end of the Wisconsinian glaciation, about 15,000 to 10,000 years ago. Thus, brassy ringlets are present on the North American continent quite exactly for the same length of time as a significant human population. Systematics and taxonomy Occasionally, as few as three species of brassy ringlets are accepted, or these are treated as superspecies. E. tyndarus is used for populations from the Pyrenees and Alps, and E. ottomana for those of the Balkans and the Caucasus. However, in this case the Caucasus population would also seem to warrant recognition at the same taxonomic rank as the others, as E. iranica. In addition, the related butterflies around Beringia have been united in the E. callias superspecies. Therefore, though E. callias might be split up on grounds of biogeography and ecology, the molecular and morphological data are still more in favor of retaining a single species. Based on analyses of mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 and CoxII sequence, ecological, and morphological data, the following species and well-distinct subspecies ought to be recognized: Several brassy ringlets are shown in the lowest row on this plate from the 1915 Macrolepidoptera of the World, edited by Adalbert Seitz. * Erebia calcaria Lorkovic, 1949 - Lorkovic's brassy ringlet * Erebia callias Edwards, 1871 ** Erebia (callias) altajana Staudinger, 1901 ** Erebia (callias) callias - Colorado alpine ** Erebia (callias) sibirica Staudinger, 1881 ** Erebia (callias) simulata Warren, 1933 * Erebia cassioides (Reiner & Hohenwarth, 1792) - Common brassy ringlet ** Erebia (cassioides) arvernensis Oberth√ºr 1908 - western brassy ringlet ** Erebia (cassioides) carmenta Fruhstorfer, 1907 - western brassy ringlet ** Erebia (cassioides) macedonica Buresch, 1918 * Erebia graucasica Jachontov, 1909 * Erebia hispania Butler, 1868 - Spanish brassy ringlet * Erebia iranica Grum-Grshimailo, 1895 * Erebia nivalis Lorkovic & Lesse, 1954 - de Lesse's brassy ringlet * Erebia ottomana Herrich-Sch√§ffer, [1851] - Ottoman brassy ringlet ** Erebia (ottomana) benacensis Warren 1933 * Erebia rondoui Oberth√ºr 1908 (previously in E. cassioides) * Erebia transcaucasica Warren, 1950 (previously in E. graucasica) * Erebia tyndarus - Swiss brassy ringlet See also * Species concept * Species problem Footnotes References * (2008): Molecular phylogeny of the Erebia tyndarus (Lepidoptera, Rhopalocera, Nymphalidae, Satyrinae) species group combining CoxII and ND5 mitochondrial genes: A case study of a recent radiation.

The film concerns an American horror/science fiction novelist who finds the plot of one of his stories unfold around him after a conference in Spain.  Synopsis  On the island city of Palma de Mallorca, David Norton (Hutton) promotes his latest book, The Kovak Box before a small private gathering of European fans. While nothing unusual happens, one of the audience members has a distinctive Russian Mafia arm tattoo, and the hotel concierges are subtly condescending towards Norton, despite the writer's mannered patronage and celebrity status. Later in the evening, Norton's fiancee, Jane, receives an anonymous phone call and jumps off their hotel balcony. After Jane dies from her injuries in the hospital, Norton discovers a nearby patient, Silvia Mendez (Jim√©nez), did the same thing on the same night: While taking a shower, Silvia answered a call consisting only of the 1933 song Gloomy Sunday by composer Rezs≈ë Seress. After jumping from her window, she only remembers waking up nude under a crushed bar canopy. Silvia is a young nightclub debutante with no enemies or connections to the American couple. While Silvia recuperates in her apartment, a mysterious man attempts to stab her in the back of the neck but flees after their struggle. After the attack, Silvia reunites with Norton, who is also being pursued by unknown assailants. Norton finds that the events coincide with the plot of his latest book, which is based on a real individual: Frank Kovak (Kelly), a Hungarian doctor who was disgraced and driven to exile after his experiments were passed off as psychological warfare. Kovak used neural implants and paid a network of criminals to reproduce the experiment -- in which everyone takes their life (or suffers a brutal death) while the Gloomy Sunday song plays -- on Norton. Ailing from a terminal brain tumor, Kovak has nothing to lose except Norton winning his deadly game.

It claims to be the first comprehensive school in England and Wales, opening in 1949 as Holyhead County School. History The school was formed in 1949 with the amalgamation of Holyhead Grammar and St Cybi Secondary school and became the first comprehensive in the UK. There was a number of reasons for the school to be the first \\"comp\\". The headmaster Mr Hughes was retiring and he was to be replaced by an enthusiast for Comprehensive education, Trefor Lovett. The new head became known as \\"the first apostle of the comprehensive movement.\\"Holyhead County School , Holyhead.com, accessed 12 August 2008 The transition was also assisted by the close proximity of St Cybi Secondary school and Holyhead Grammar; the schools that would be replaced. Obviously the backing of Anglesey Education Committee was essential. The changes that Lovett brought about were not unexpected as he had previously taught locally at Vaynor and Penderyn schools. The new school was certain that a child's future should not be determined at age eleven with the eleven plus exam. Previously children in Wales had all sat an exam at the end of their junior school education and this decided whether they would attend the grammar school or a secondary modern school. Lovett was convinced that this was unfair and that there should be a firm catchment area so that all the students irrespective of their background or abilities would attend the one school. After two years, the new head reported, The school today In 2006 there were approximately 850 pupils in the school which included about 100 in the sixth form.2006 Inspection of the school by Estyn, accessed 12 August 2008 The school had falling rolls in the years before and is much reduced since there were questions in the early 1960s in the House of Commons to then Education Minister Chris Chataway enquiring how the school was to cope with a roll of 1400 pupils.Hansard, 22 November 1962 In 2010 the school exceeded the local authority's projected figures.Holyhead School to be Demolished, Daily Post, 24 July 2008, accessed 12 August 2008 Twelve per cent of the students are able to speak Welsh fluently and four per cent have Welsh as their first language. The catchment area of the school is mainly the town of Holyhead and the area around the school has been highlighted as an area for development with nearly 30% of households having no wage earner. Estyn visited the school in 2008 and commended the school with regards to teaching and pupil behaviour. Five years ago the school moved its sixth form out of the old red brick Cybi building and put that in the control of the local authority. Since then the building has become dilapidated and the education authority announced in 2008 it intended to demolish the building. The building was still standing as of 2012. As a result of the intervention of local county councillor, Robert Llewelyn Jones, CADW has given the fa√ßade a Grade 2 listing. This listing has prevented the local authority from continuing with its demolition plans and the site is now earmarked for a new super-primary school (subject to funding being available). At present virtually all pupils in the Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi catchment area choose the school for their secondary education. The school's pupil numbers continues to rise and recent significant funding towards a new canteen/refrectory and technology block has succeeded in improving the school's facilities dramatically.

Life He studied at the German College, Rome, from 1567 to 1575; on 28 October 1573, as dean of the students he gave a short address before Pope Gregory XIII, when he visited the newly organized academy. He was ordained in St. John Lateran on Easter Saturday, 1575, and returned to Germany in the summer of that year; on his way home he was made doctor of theology at Bologna (11 June 1575). He was summoned to Mainz by the Elector Daniel Brendel von Homburg, where he was active in the reform of the clergy. From there he was sent by the elector to Erfurt, to assist the suffragan bishop Nicolaus Elgard in his efforts for the restoration of Catholicism. His sermons on the doctrine of the Eucharist, preached at Erfurt in Lent, 1579, involved him in sharp controversy with the Protestant preachers. He was sent to Rome in 1582 to bring the pallium for the new archbishop, Wolfgang von Dalberg. The latter brought him back again to Mainz, and employed him on his affairs, notably on the visitation of monasteries. Also in 1601 and 1604 he brought from Rome the confirmation and the pallium for the succeeding archbishops, Adam von Bicken, and Schweikard von Cronberg. He wrote and preached, defending the Catholic faith, until his death. He was provost of St. Moritz, dean of the Liebfrauenstift, canon of St. Victor's and St. Peter's, all in Mainz; and canon of St. Severus' at Erfurt. After 1575 he also had a canonry in the cathedral chapter at Breslau. He did not visit Breslau until 1599, and then only for a short time, while taking part in the election of a bishop; he then went to Rome to bring the confirmation of the elected bishop. Works His polemical and apologetic writings are: *\\"De festo Corporis Christi in honorem Jesu Christi\\" (Mainz, 1580); *\\"Augenschein des Jesuiter Spiegels, so neuwlich zu Erffurdt in truck aussgangen\\" (Cologne, 1582); *\\"De sacramentis, mille sexcenti errores, vaniloquia et cavillationes eorum, qui hoc tempore ab Ecclesia secesserunt catholica, cum brevi eorum refutatione; plerique collecti ex Kemnitio\\" (Mainz, 1593); *\\"Brevis discussio et refutatio sexcentorum errorum, quos duo Praedicantes Saxonici Tilemannus Heshusius et Joannes Olearius Pontificiis hoc est Christianis Catholicis vanissime hactenus attribuerunt\\" (Mainz, 1604).

History Stock Windmill was built circa 1816 joining an existing post mill. In 1845, a second post mill was moved to a site close by. By 1862, the mill had four shuttered sails. The two post mills were demolished c.1890, about which time the millstones were moved down a floor and the drive converted from underdrift to overdrift. A steam engine was added in 1902 and the mill was working by wind until 1930 and afterwards by an internal combustion engine until c.1936. The mill was bought by Essex County Council in 1945 and although preserved, by 1977 it was without the fantail and associated supporting timbers, and down to only one pair of sails. Major repairs were started in 1991 by Vincent Pargeter. A grant from English Heritage part-funded the work. The Friends of Stock Mill were formed in 1993 on completion of the restoration. Description The mill is a five-storey tower mill with four single Patent sails It has a boat-shaped cap winded by a six-bladed fantail. The tower is internal diameter at ground level and internal diameter at curb level. The walls are thick to first floor level and thick above that. The tower is high overall and the mill is to the top of the cap. As built, the mill had a stage at first-floor level, four common sails and was winded by hand. It originally drove two pairs of overdrift millstones. The cast-iron windshaft was probably not made for the mill originally. It carries a diameter composite brake wheel with 81 cogs which has been converted from clasp arm construction. This drives a cast-iron wallower with 25 teeth. The cast-iron upright shaft is diameter and in three parts, with dog clutches at the fourth and fifth floor. The cast-iron great spur wheel is diameter with 76 cogs.

Mobile phones used to be a separate market but the boundaries between them and music players are beginning to blur. A stand- alone business when threatened with an envelopment attack has few options but to change the business model or sell off the business to the attacker. RealPlayer was a dominant player in the streaming video business and had created a two sided market out of which the consumers were the subsidized side. The content providers were the money side which paid Real for their streaming software. Microsoft launched an envelopment attack on Real by providing the streaming server software clubbed with their Windows NT operating system. The content providers saw no point in continuing using Real and moved to windows platform threatening the existence of Real. Windows could afford to do so since the provision of such a service boosted their sales of the OS and the mass adoption of the Windows Media Player on the consumer side which was the only compatible player with the windows streaming platform.  Typology of Envelopment Attacks  The two different networks can be complements, substitutes and functionally unrelated. The relationship between the two networks is the basis on how the attack is launched.  Envelopment of Complements  A network market consists of several players operating in various adjacent layers. In this kind of attack a player tries to gain a dominant position in the adjacent layer by bundling the services the adjacent layer player provides in its own offerings.  Envelopment of Weak Substitutes  Price a person is willing to pay for a bundle consisting of two perfect substitutes will be the one which he uses either of them and hence there would be no value for a firm to envelope a platform which acts as a perfect substitute for its own offering. However, there is a value to be created when we have in question a set of weak substitutes.  Envelopment of Unrelated Platforms  The platforms previously meant for a different usage begin to converge as the common set of users begin to rise. Such is the case with mobile phones and video game devices which were used for distinct purposes but the digital platforms available today have converged all such usages into one.

They became famous in the late '70s and early '80s along with other Japanese bands in the genre. Its most famous lineup included its members from late 1986 to 1990: guitarist Masahiro Andoh, saxophonist/flutist/EWI player Takeshi Itoh, bassist Mitsuru Sutoh, keyboardist Hirotaka Izumi and drummer Hiroyuki Noritake. They are known for songs such as \\"Truth\\", \\"Japanese Soul Brothers\\", \\"Takarajima\\", \\"Omens of Love\\", among others. \\"Truth\\" has been used as the theme for Fuji Television's Formula One (F1) coverage from 1989 to 2000 and since 2012. A special arrangement, \\"Truth 21c\\", was used as the theme for Japan's F1 2001 and 2002, respectively, and other remixes of were used from 2003 to 2006. History College Beginnings (1976‚Äì1978) In 1976, the band started as a small jazz fusion group in Meiji University with a very basic line-up, made of bassist Yuhji Nakamura, guitarist Masahiro Andoh, pianist Jun Hakama and drummer Shunichi Harada. According to Masahiro Andoh, the band's name was based on Madison Square Garden. Hakama and Harada were replaced by Junko Miyagi on keyboards and Michael S. Kawai on drums, and a young, debuting Takeshi Itoh joining in on saxophone and flutes, in 1977. The Square (1978‚Äì1988) With backing guitarist Yuhji Mikuriya, keyboardist Shiro Sagisu and percussionist Kiyohiko Senba joining in 1978, the band was then named \\"The Square\\". It had a semi-generic, disco-type sound. Lead saxophonist Takeshi Itoh adopted the Lyricon as a side instrument. The Square would then begin a tradition of writing one to three songs with the Lyricon in every new album thereafter. As the years progressed, the number of members had dwindled from eight members (two keyboardists, two guitarists, a drummer, a Percussionist, a sax player and a bassist) to five (a drummer, a keyboardist, a guitarist, a sax player and a bassist). The group's sound had also evolved to a more rock- oriented music when Junko Miyagi and Michael S. Kawai were replaced by drummer Jun Aoyama (better known as Tatsuro Yamashita's drummer from 1979 to 2003) and Prism keyboardist Daisaku Kume. Kume only joined the band as a Support Member and left a year thereafter. Percussionist Kiyohiko Senba left the group altogether. Jun Aoyama was later replaced by Eiji Shimizu on drums and Yuhji Nakamura was replaced by bassist Toyoyuki Tanaka in 1981. In 1982, Tohru Hasebe replaced Shimizu and Hirotaka Izumi joined the band, replacing Kume. Izumi eventually became the second-longest tenured keyboardist over 15 years with T-Square (1982 to 1997). This would be the band's first consistent line- up, lasting until late 1985. Hiroyuki Noritake would then replace Hasebe on drums in 1986 as their first long-term drummer. By the start of 1987, Mitsuru Sutoh replaced Toyoyuki Tanaka on Bass, being the first long-term bassist in the group. Takeshi Itoh would go on to swap his Lyricon for an AKAI EWI before the band made their first release in the United States. It is believed that their first performance in the US. was at the Cat Club in N.Y. Before they made their way to the Roxy in Los Angeles, they realized there was already a group from the UK called \\"The Squares\\". Thus, the band changed their name to \\"T-Square\\". T-Square (1988‚Äì2000) The band's performance at the Roxy marked their first live album as T-Square. Two years later, Masato Honda debuted with them as a backing saxophonist on the album T-Square Live (featuring F1 Grand Prix Theme). In 1991, Takeshi Itoh pursued a solo career, and Honda replaced him. Honda also composed the opening track from T-Square's \\"New-S\\" Album, \\"Megalith\\". After the release of the \\"Blue in Red\\" album in 1997, Honda left the group to pursue his solo career. Takahiro Miyazaki would replace him. At the same time, Hirotaka Izumi left T-Square and was replaced by Tadashi Namba. Namba played keyboards on the theme song from Gran Turismo, \\"Moon Over The Castle\\" (from Masahiro's solo album \\"Andy's\\", released in 1996) as well as the T-Square arrangement of the song, called \\"Knight's Song\\", from \\"Blue in Red\\". The group and all former and (at the time) current members played at Yaon de Asobu for their 20th Anniversary that same year. This is one of the last T-Square performances in which Masato Honda was involved (unlike Miyazaki and Itoh, Honda didn't participate in the next four anniversary concerts in 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018 respectively). In 1999, Tadashi Namba was replaced by Keiji Matsumoto. The new line-up of Miyazaki, Noritake, Sutoh, Matsumoto and Andoh was kept until the group's brief dissolution in mid-2000. T-Square Plus and Session Members (2000‚Äì2002) In mid-2000, the band was divided into T-Square (original and long-term guitarist Masahiro Andoh, returning saxophonist Takeshi Itoh and session musicians) and Trio The Square (bassist Mitsuru Sutoh, drummer Hiroyuki Noritake and keyboardist Keiji Matsumoto). This trio was the main reason for why T-Square had to employ session musicians to record with the exception of the \\"Friendship Live\\" performance. The performance had ex-long term drummer, Hiroyuki Noritake, along with support bassist Kiyoshi Murakami and then-Support/Guest- keyboardist, Keizoh Kawano, the latter of whom would become the longest tenured keyboardist over 20 years with T-Square (2000-2020). T-Square changed its name again to T-Square Plus. Former guitarist Yuhji Mikuriya as well as former Seikima-II bassist Shunsuke \\"Xenon\\" Ishikawa and session keyboardist Takehiro Kawabe joined them briefly in 2002. After that, the band dropped the \\"Plus\\" from their name, but kept using session musicians until 2003. 25th Anniversary, The Square/T Comes Back (2003) In 2003, they released an album called \\"Spirits\\" under their original name, \\"The Square\\", and retained some of their original members (partly due to T-Square's 25th Anniversary that year) and kept their newcomer, Keizoh Kawano. The line-up was Itoh, Noritake, Sutoh, Kawano (support), Izumi and Andoh. They released another album, that featured new arrangements of some of their best known songs, called \\"T Comes Back\\". New Band Members (2004‚Äì2008) Since then, the group changed their name again to T-Square. In 2004, Katsuji Morioka joined and replaced Mitsuru Sutoh on bass. A year later, Morioka was replaced by Shingo Tanaka as support bassist. In 2004, Keizoh Kawano became an official keyboardist. Drummer Satoshi Bandoh replaced Hiroyuki Noritake in the same year. T-Square's original drummer, Michael S. Kawai, returned as a behind-the-scenes percussionist and producer from 2004 to 2008. 30th Anniversary and T-Square Super Band/Super Special Band, First Lineup (2008‚Äì2009) The band briefly changed their name to T-Square Super Band, to promote their 30th Anniversary Tour. Most former T-Square members were involved in recording their new album, \\"Wonderful Days\\", adding even more former members. This began in Mid-to- Late-2008 after the end of their \\"Wonderful Days\\" Tour. After, the group changed its name to T-Square Super Special Band and played on Yaon de Asobu for their 30th Anniversary Show. This show was released on February 2009 as \\"The Square~T-Square since 1978: 30th Anniversary Festival\\". Self-Cover Era (2009‚Äì2012) With the release of their 2009 Album, Discoveries, only 3 months after the release of the aforementioned DVD, the group dropped \\"Super Special Band\\" from their name and cut the members down to keyboardist Keizoh Kawano, drummer Satoshi Bandoh, returning support bassist Shingo Tanaka and the two original T-Square members, Masahiro Andoh and Takeshi Itoh. Discoveries was sold with a DVD which chronicled T-Square performing and rehearsing in 2008. In 2010, they released a brand new album, \\"Jikan Ryoko\\"‚Äîwhich is the Japanese phrase for \\"Time Travel\\". This album was meant to showcase more of the songwriting abilities of the younger members of the group. In the Summer of that same year, they re-recorded some of their older songs and release them in October as an album called \\"Takara no Uta: T-Square plays The Square\\". They would go on to release another original album, \\"Nine Stories\\", on April 2011. Some current and former T-Square members would tour with Satoshi Bandoh to promote his solo album, \\"Happy Life!\\", in late 2011. T-Square recorded another T-Square plays The Square album, released late in October, much like last year. Keizoh Kawano recorded and released his own solo album, Dreams, the month thereafter. At the end of 2011, they performed a new song, 'Bird of Wonder', which was released with their 2012 album, \\"Wings\\". The group later released another cover album, this time employing the help of special guest musicians. 35th Anniversary and Rumors of Takeshi Itoh's Second Departure (2013) This marks the second time that T-Square has branded themselves \\"T-Square Super Band\\", now in promotion of their 35th Anniversary, \\"T-Square's 35th Anniversary Festival\\". They retained all members of the Super Band from 2008, except for pianist Hirotaka Izumi, and including percussionist Kiyohiko Senba. Shingo Tanaka was also promoted from a support member to an official member of the band. Upon the Release of \\"Smile\\", the new T-Square Super Band Album, a picture was included in the release, with Japanese Text/Kanji clearly reading something to the effect of \\"Itoh's Resignation\\", making fans believe that Takeshi Itoh would once again leave. In their last album of 2013, T-Square Plus ‚Äì \\"History\\", Itoh only performed on 2 tracks of the album, but haven't left the band after all. T-Square Begins Streaming Music Overseas (2014 ‚Äì 2017) \\"T-Square's 35th Anniversary Festival\\" show was released as a Blu-ray in May 2014. Nearly a month later, their album was released, \\"NEXT\\". The 40th T-Square album, \\"Paradise\\", was released in July 2015, being one of ten T-Square Albums (along with Lucky Summer Lady, Midnight Lover (both from 1978), Make Me a Star (1979), Magic (1981), Kyakusenbi no Yuuwaku (1982), Stars and the Moon (1984), SPORTS (1986), Yes, No (1988), and Friendship (2000)) not to be released in Spring. \\"Paradise\\" was the first T-Square album to be released on iTunes and Spotify in the United States, along with their Compilation of Concerts performed from December 19th to 24th of 2015 and their following studio album from 2016, \\"Treasure Hunter\\". While these are all released in the American iTunes, they are the only 3 albums available there, while the Japanese iTunes has a more extense discography. T-Square released their album, \\"REBIRTH\\", in April 2017. 40th Anniversary and Changing Keyboardists (Late 2017 ‚Äì 2020) In 2017, T-Square performed two separate concerts at the Blue Note in Tokyo. The first one with their 1982-1985 Lineup of Masahiro Andoh, Takeshi Itoh, Tohru Hasebe, Toyoyouki Tanaka, and Hirotaka Izumi with Keizoh Kawano playing backing synth. The second one included their 1987-1990 Lineup of Masahiro Andoh, Takeshi Itoh, Hiroyuki Noritake, Mitsuru Sutoh, and Hirotaka Izumi with Keizoh Kawano playing backing synth. In 2018, T-Square released two albums, \\"City Coaster\\" in April was their studio album. To Celebrate their 40th Anniversary, the group released another studio album, \\"It's a Wonderful Life!\\" in November. \\"It's a Wonderful Life!\\" was also the name of their 40th Anniversary Concert. This particular concert included most of the usual members of a \\"T-Square Super Band\\", also they performed \\"Takarajima\\" with the Nishiarai Junior High School Brass Band Club. This Concert also included Daisaku Kume, who hadn't played with T-Square since their 20th Anniversary in 1998. T-Square already had planned to record the next album \\"Horizon\\" in Los Angeles, but on February 6, 2019, their keyboardist Keizoh Kawano was hospitalized due to an intracerebral hemorrhage and due to the abrupt changes, the T-Square members were not free to travel to the U.S. to stay and record the album, so Philippe Saisse, who hadn't played with T-Square since 1995's \\"T-Square and Friends\\", but played on Satoshi Bandoh's \\"Step By Step\\" album from 2016, offered to finish the keyboard parts. They managed to release \\"Horizon\\" in April 2019. In December 2019, Akito Shirai joined the band as their Keyboardist while bassist Shingo Tanaka became a Support Member again. The now 6-Member T-Square recorded and released \\"AI Factory\\" to a two month delay as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. On August 28, 2020 it was announced that T-Square would release a new Self-Cover album named \\"Cr√®me de la Cr√®me\\", part of which includes a hand-picked collection of Keizoh Kawano's best songs.

Timeline Offshoot bands The following list includes bands that include multiple (former or current) members of T-Square. AnMi2 AnMi2 are a guitar duo comprising the first two guitarists of T-Square, Masahiro Andoh and Yuhji Mikuriya. Trio The Square/The Masato Honda Band/Voice of Elements This group began as a result of creative differences between the members of the T-Square Line-up of 1999-Early 2000, but the trio began in mid-1999, with keyboardist Keiji Matsumoto, drummer Hiroyuki Noritake and bassist Mitsuru Sutoh as Trio The Square. Trio The Square disbanded in later 2000. Later on that year, Hiroyuki Noritake and Keiji Matsumoto, along with Bassist Tomohito Aoki, Guitarist Jun Kajiwara, would become the backing band of former T-Square saxophonist, Masato Honda. The group didn't have an official name, but, was collectively dubbed by fans as \\"The Masato Honda Band\\". The Masato Honda Band was put on hold in 2005, then fully deactivated in Early Mid-2006, to make way for Voice of Elements, which featured, again, Hiroyuki Noritake and Keiji Matsumoto. Tomohito Aoki, the original bassist of the Masato Honda Band, died of acute heart failure on June that year, therefore, he was replaced by Mitsuru Sutoh. As of Sutoh joining the group, Everyone who ever joined it was also a previous member of T-Square. Voice of Elements, as the band was called when they returned in 2006, continued performing and recording through 2007. Ottottrio This group was a Fusion Supergroup, led by 3 guitarists, T-Square's Masahiro Andoh, Casiopea's Issei Noro and KORENOS' Hirokuni Korekata. Along with Masahiro Andoh, Drummer Hiroyuki Noritake was another T-Square musician who was part of this group since 1988. Also, T-Square Bassist, Mitsuru Sutoh and (at the time) Future T-Square keyboardist, Keiji Matsumoto recorded with them at the end of 1998 (and actually joined T-Square a few months thereafter.). KoreNoS This band was formed in 2004 by Hirokuni Korekata, Hiroyuki Noritake and Mitsuru Sutoh. They released 2 studio albums, \\"Asian Street Style\\" (2004) and \\"Abracadabra\\" (2005). They also released a live album in 2007. Casiopea vs. The Square Although \\"Casiopea vs. The Square\\" was performed as a one-off event in 2003 (the DVD and the CD have different audio sources suggesting that there may have been 2 shows), this extension of 2 different Jazz-Fusion bands goes back to 1993. Former Percussionist of The Square, Kiyohiko Senba, played on one of the songs from Casiopea's 1993 album, \\"Dramatic\\". A year later, Both Groups played an arrangement of The Beatles' \\"Get Back\\" on a Japanese Broadcast. 3 years after that, Casiopea, T-Square and Jimsaku played at Tokyo Jam 1997, with the same song. In 2003, Both Groups played (with some of the players replaced), at the event called Casiopea vs. The Square. Both Groups still have somewhat of an alliance, seeing as Casiopea's 1993 ‚Äì 1997 drummer, Noriaki Kumagai and Former T-Square Bassist, Mitsuru Sutoh are both in TRIX. And Sax player Takeshi Itoh performed with Casiopea's Keyboardist, Minoru Mukaiya in 2006. Synchronized DNA Drummers Hiroyuki Noritake of T-Square and Akira Jimbo of Casiopea made a Drum Duo in 2003, after the \\"Casiopea vs. The Square\\" concert. Pyramid Pianist Hirotaka Izumi, ex-Casiopea drummer Akira Jimbo and guitarist Yuji Toriyama along with other studio musicians, form the band \\"Pyramid\\". They have released four studio albums. As Support Members for Other Artists After the dissolution of Trio the Square, Mitsuru Sutoh and Keiji Matsumoto would later become backing musicians for Japanese Acapella Pop group, 'The Gospellers'. Sutoh also plays for TRIX (since they formed in 2004). Other recognized musicians in that group are Noriaki Kumagai (Casiopea drummer from 1993 ‚Äì 1996). Drummer Hiroyuki Noritake and Keyboardist Keizoh Kawano, along with Bassist Ko Shimizu (from Naniwa Express) would record as Support Members for J-Fusion/Rock guitarist Kumi Adachi in 2007‚Äì2008. T-Square's current Bassist Shingo Tanaka is a former part of The 39's/The Thank You's (39 in Japanese can be pronounced as san ky≈´, which resembles Thank You). The 39's were a band that accompanied Concerts performed by Vocaloids, specifically the \\"39's Giving Day\\" concert series (again, that would sound like \\"Thanksgiving Day\\"), although the concerts themselves wouldn't necessarily be held on said day. During the final 39's Giving Day Concert in March, 2012, the band were also accompanied by Takahiro Miyazaki.

It was a nominee for the Nebula Award in 1968. It was published in the United Kingdom under the title Vornan-19. Plot summary Vornan-19 arrives on Christmas Day, 1998 in Rome. He floats down from the sky naked, landing on the Spanish Steps. The police try to arrest him but he knocks them over with a touch. He is helped and given clothes by Horst Klein who believes that the apocalypse will come in 389 days. Vornan-19 tells him that he is from the year 2999. Jack Bryant, a graduate student under Leo Garfield at the University of California is working toward a process to extract huge amounts of energy from ordinary matter. He leaves the physics department, marries pretty blonde named Shirley and they move to the deserts of Arizona. Leo Garfield spends several months with Jack and Shirley to get a break from his physics work. During Vornan-19's first public press conference he mentions the fact that in the future society is very different because they have tapped the energy within all matter so that no one has to work to obtain energy. Leo Garfield tells Jack that he left the University because he had actually finished his thesis showing how to extract the enormous amounts of energy within all particles of matter. He could not bear to release this theory since it would dramatically change human society. He asks Jack to use his influence to question Vornan-19 on the subject to see if it was his theory that was used in the future. When Jack returns to the University, he has a call from the White House and is forced to join a group of scientists working for the US government on how to best deal with Vornan-19. Vornan-19 comes to New York City where he meets with the group of scientists, attends an outrageous house party and tours the New York Stock Exchange. He reveals during the tour that in 2999 there is no capitalism and even no money. All citizens have all that they need. After visiting the stock market Vornan requests a visit to an automated brothel in Chicago. During an interview in California, Vornan-19 says that in the future they have determined how life began on the earth. An alien spacecraft visited the earth long ago on a scouting mission and discovered no life forms and so departed; but before they left they jettisoned a load of their garbage that landed on earth and eventually started life. Vornan then goes to the moon, and when he returns he takes a break from his tour of the earth by staying with Leo's friends Jack and Shirley in Arizona. Shirley subtly offers herself to Vornan but he shows no interest, Vornan instead seduces Jack. Shirley then sleeps with Leo who has been wanting her for years. Vornan has been made into a messiah by the people of earth. He visits Buenos Aires using a personal shield technology that should allow him to interact with the crowds. The shield fails and Vornan is grabbed by the crowd and his body is never recovered. Leo remains in Buenos Aires until the turn of the century.

Although he is repeatedly quoted and praised by several theologians of his time, little was written about his life. De poenitentia, restitutione et contractibus, 1581 Life He was born at Medina de Pomar in the Province of Burgos (rather than Alcal√°, as some writers state). He entered the College of St. Ildefonsus at Alcal√°, 20 May 1516, took doctor's degrees in philosophy and theology, and soon after was made canon and master of theology at the university. He was selected as primary professor of theology in the College of St. Ildefonsus in succession to Michael Carasco, whom Cardinal Ximenes wished to be made perpetual Rector of the College. From about 1526 and for the space of twenty years, Medina filled this position. Alvarez Gomez and Andrea Schott state that Medina was buried in the church of St. Ildefonsus. The first lines of the epitaph on his tomb are: :Complutense decus jacet hic, attente viator :Ter tumultum lustra, ter pia thura crema :Hoc moriente silet vox, qua non clarior unquam :Compluti fulsit, nec fuit illa. Works Medina's works are principally on moral theology and ethics. Some of his opinions were not in accordance with the doctrine propounded at the Council of Trent. The \\"Diccionario Enciclop. Hispano Americano\\" says that his treatise \\"de Poenitientia\\" was put on the Index published in 1707; the edition of the Index printed in 1711 does not give Medina's work, nor does any of the subsequent editions. The Council of Trent declares that at the hour of death there is no \\"reservatio\\" and that all priests can absolve \\"in articulo mortis\\". Medina says \\"that absolution given by an excommunicated priest is invalid\\"; and again, \\"at a time of necessity (arliculo necessitatis) any priest, not suspended or excommunicated can absolve any person\\". His opinions on the \\"materia\\" for sacramental absolution, and on the \\"Copia confessariorum\\" seem opposed to the teaching of the council on these points. Many editions of Medina's works were printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His brother John de Medina brought out the theological books at Alcala in 1544 and sqq.; Salamanca, 1555; Ingoldstadt, 1581; Brescia, 1590‚Äì1606; Cologne, 1607 etc. References ;Attribution * 1490 births 1547 deaths Spanish Roman Catholic theologians 16th-century Spanish theologians ","title":"Juan de Medina"},{"id":"18823510","text":"Sri Suriyendra (; ; 1767‚Äì1836) was the queen of Siam, wife of Phutthaloetla Naphalai, who was her cousin, and mother of Mongkut and Pinklao.

Princess Bunrot lived with her mother in the Grand Palace and grew up with her maternal female cousins, the daughters of Phutthayotfa Chulalok. Princess Bunrot had an affair with her cousin, Prince Isarasundhorn, a son and heir apparent to King Phutthayotfa Chulalok. In 1801, the King discovered the princess' four-month pregnancy and banished her from the Grand Palace to live with her brother Prince Thepharirak. Prince Isarasundhorn begged his father to no avail to return the princess to the palace. The couple eventually settled at the Old Palace (Thonburi Palace) and Princess Bunrot became the prince's consort. The baby died, however, shortly after birth.

To a larger or smaller degree, the curriculum is derived from the practice of ninjutsu, the arts of the ninja; covert agents or assassins of feudal Japan. One of the earliest modern schools to be established was the Bujinkan Organization in 1978 by martial artist Masaaki Hatsumi. The organization teaches nine different martial arts styles, three of which are named after and claim to be descended from historical ninjutsu styles. Stephen K. Hayes, an early student of Shoto Tanemura and later Hatsumi, took what he learned to the United States in the 1970s, starting his own group of organizations called Quest Centers and his own martial arts style, To-Shin Do. Several other schools of ninjutsu also were created during the 1970s, including the Dux Ryu Ninjutsu school in 1975 and the Nindo Ryu Bujutsu Kai federation in 1979. During the 1980s, several other schools of ninjutsu also began to be developed across the world, with the Genbukan being founded in 1984 in Japan by Shoto Tanemura, a former friend and student of Hatsumi, and the AKBAN school being developed in Israel in 1986 by Doron Navon's student, Yossi Sherriff, as an offshoot of the Bujinkan Organization. The Banke Shinobinoden school, which claims to have a long history, began teaching Koga and Iga ninjutsu more popularly with the opening of the Iga-ry≈´ Ninja Museum by Jinichi Kawakami, and the Kuroryukan school, founded in 2004 by Nuno Santos, teaching Iga and Koga Ryu Ninjutsu. In Brazil, there is the Hosho Ryu Ninpo (Ê≠©Âì®ÊµÅÂøçÊ≥ï) school founded by Shihan C√≠cero Melo on 10.01.1998 in the city of S√£o Paulo, also known as Hosho. The school is descended from the Koga Ryu lineage of Japan and one of the main Ninja references in Brazil. The Jinkage- Ryu Ninpo Bugei school (‰∫∫ÂΩ±ÈöÜÂøçÊ≥ïÊ≠¶Ëä∏) Colchester ninjutsu, Essex uk is a Gendai school (Áèæ‰ª£ÂøçÊ≥ï modern ninjutsu school) and was established and founded by Sensei Roger Small in or around 1993. The emphasis of the training in this particular school, is based upon pragmatic combat and survival skills for today's environment. The Jinkage-Ryu Ninpo Bugei school has no historical links or claims to being a Kory≈´ school. Gendai. The historical claims of some of these modern schools have been questioned with regard to whether they truly qualify as Kory≈´. 1970s Bujinkan In 1979, Masaaki Hatsumi founded the Bujinkan organization. It uses the concepts of Ninjutsu in three of its nine schools though they have since steered away from the \\"Ninjutsu\\" moniker in order to avoid stereotypes and since the art, which contains 9 ry≈´ha (or schools), only has 3 schools based on the ninja while the other 6 are based on samurai tactics. Shadows of Iga Society Stephen K. Hayes founded the \\"Shadows of Iga Society\\" in order to promote ninjutsu studies in North America. He studied with Shoto Tanemura and then with Masaaki Hatsumi. Hayes introduced the concepts of ninjutsu to North America. He founded a ninjutsu dojo in the mid-1970s, in Atlanta, Georgia. In about 1980, Hayes moved to Dayton, Ohio where he continued to teach. Nindo Ryu Bujutsu Kai The \\"Nindo Ryu Bujutsu Kai\\" is a martial arts federation founded in 1979. It has a gendai ninjutsu division under the direction of Carlos R. Febres. Febres was a former student of Shoto Tanemura and T. Higushi and studies with of Ron Duncan and Bo Munthe. \\"Nindo Ryu Gendai Ninjutsu\\" uses modern application and interpretation of the \\"Takamatsuden, Koga (koka) & eclectic schools of ninjutsu. 1980s During the 1980s, several schools of ninjutsu were developed both in and outside Japan.Such as in 1986, in Israel, Yossi Sheriff founded Akban. The school's curriculum is based on that which was taught to Doron Navon (Sheriff's teacher). Navon was the first foreign Bujinkan shihan. He studied with Tanemura and then with Hatsumi. Genbukan organization was founded in 1984 by Soke Tanemura.\\"The Battle for Ninja Supremacy\\", Adams, Andy. Black Belt Magazine, May, 1986. Tanemura initially studied under Masaaki Hatsumi and then sought out all the remaining students of Takamatsu (Kimura Masaji, Sato Kinbei, Fukumoto Yoshio, Matoyoshi Nakayama) as well as their successors (Kobayashi, Ueno Takashi's personal student), (Akimoto Koki) and others. He was also the Vice President of the Bujinkan Shidoshi Association. (Tanemura left Hatsumi's tutelage after a disagreement).\\"The Battle for Ninja Supremacy\\", p.20, Black Belt Magazine, DEC 1985, Vol. 23, No12 The Genbukan organization includes over 100 dojos in approximately 30 countries and 20 states in the USA. The organization, Genbukan Ninpo Bugei (ÁéÑÊ≠¶È§®ÂøçÊ≥ïÊ≠¶Ëä∏) has 36 divisions called \\"ninja sanjurokkei\\". The schools teach taijutsu, bikenjutsu and keishinteki kyoyo as well as b≈ç jutsu, yumi, naginata, yari, jutte, kusari-gama, and shuriken. The Kokusai Jujutsu Renmei (international organization) also teaches traditional Japanese Jujutsu techniques. and self- defense techniques such as goshinjutsu, 'koryu karate' and 'chugoku Kenpo'. It should be noted however that neither Bujinkan nor Genbukan should be considered true koryu, mostly due to the inability to prove their lineage to pre Meiji restoration, and many documents were embellished to make them appear older than they really are. There is also some criticism that both Hatsumi and Tanemura run respective organizations with profit as their prime interest. https://web.archive.org/web/20130904191109/http://scholar.harvard.edu/chrismm/pages/bugei- ryuha-daijiten-1978 Akban In 1986, in Israel, Yossi Sheriff founded Akban. The school's curriculum is based on that which was taught to Doron Navon (Sheriff's teacher). Navon was the first foreign Bujinkan shihan. He studied with Tanemura and then with Hatsumi. Kuroryukan Nuno Santos Shihan started the project in 2004. Its main influence is the main learned from a master, Ruy San Mendoza (Bujinkan Shihan), and studying with masters Sergio Cives (Nindo) and Alejandro Ramirez (Tenshi Ryu Ninpo Kai Nishi). Banke Shinobinoden The Banke Shinobinoden school began teaching koga and iga ninjutsu when these martial arts became more popular after the opening of the Iga-ry≈´ Ninja Museum. 1990 to present Quest Centers In the 1997 Stephen K. Hayes retired the Shadows of Iga society, and founded the \\"Quest Centers\\". Hayes developed To-Shin Do, a western system of Ninjutsu distinct from Bujinkan.Toller, Dennis. \\"Once the West's Most Celebrated Ninja, Stephen K. Hayes Moves Beyond the Assassin Image.\\" Black Belt Magazine. October 1998. P. 32. Jinkage-Ry≈´ Ninp≈ç Bugei The Jinkage-Ry≈´ Ninp≈ç Bugei school was founded by Roger J Small in or around 1993. The school teaches a modern format of Ninjutsu which addresses all areas of self-protection and unique survival tactics for the 21st century. Roger Small has over 40 years experience in the art of ninjutsu and his Jinkage-Ry≈´ Ninp≈ç Bugei school is basically a modern derivative of traditional ninjutsu. Hosho Ryu Ninpo Hosh≈ç Ry≈´ Ninp≈ç (Ê≠© Âì® ÊµÅ Âøç Ê≥ï) or Hosh≈ç (Ê≠© Âì®) is a Ninja school (ÂøçËÄÖ) founded by Shihan C√≠cero Melo on 10.01.1998 in the Mooca neighborhood in the city of S√£o Paulo where Honbu D≈çj≈ç (Êú¨ÈÉ® ÈÅìÂ†¥) is located. The school follows traditional Japanese standards with an important technical, cultural and philosophical deepening of the Shinobi Art (Âøç „Å≥). It has as study, the development of Ninjutsu (ÂøçË°ì), Bujutsu (Ê≠¶Ë°ì), Ninpo Kenjutsu (Âøç Ê≥ï Ââ£ Ë°ì) and Goshin jutsu (Ë≠∑Ë∫´ Ë°ì) in all its dimensions. One unique aspect of this school is the use of straight-blade swords rather than more- traditional curved swords. Jissen Kobudo Jinenkan This school was founded by Fumio \\"Unsui\\" Manaka in 1996. Manaka was a personal student of Masaaki Hatsumi and achieved \\"Menkyo Kaiden\\" in several styles of Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu; including togakure-ryu ninjutsu. Kage No Michi Ninjutsu Kage No Michi Ninjutsu, which translates into The Way of the Shadow Ninjutsu, is a modern derivative of traditional ninjutsu. This style was founded by Tafan Hong in 2005 who holds rank of Shodan in the traditional Bujinkan Ninjutsu System. Kage No Shinobu Shakai The Shadow Shinobi Society is an American organization located in the northwestern region of the United States. Founded by a group of Military Veterans with backgrounds in various martial arts in 2006. Ninjutsu became the main focus of study along with survival training. The society provides qualifications in ninjutsu and firearms along with Private Security services (Shinobi Security), then Body Guard and Bounty Hunter training for members. Controversy and opposition Concerns about modern schools of ninjutsu relate to the schools' claims to authenticity (direct lines of tutelage from the ancient schools) and secondly, to claims of notability by those who operate them. For example, some ask whether modern schools of ninjutsu qualify as \\"Kory≈´\\". The concerns about authenticity are voiced by historians of koryu arts and by representatives of the Iga Ninja Museum of Japan. Some have suggested there are no longer any true ninjutsu schools. Controversial figures in modern ninjutsu =Masaaki Hatsumi= In August 1960, Masaaki Hatsumi stated that he had studied under Takashi Ueno from the age of 24 to 29.Rekishi Dokuhon (history magazine) August, 1960. Hatsumi also said that he sometimes wrote letters to Ueno's teacher, Toshitsugu Takamatsu. However, the certificate which Takamatsu gave to Hatsumi, that named Hatsumi as the 34th Grand master of \\"Togakure ryu Ninjutsu tradition\\" is dated March 1958 and \\"Saigo no Ninja, Toshitsugu Takamatsu\\" furthermore, there is no documentation or evidence referring to the previous 33 holders of this title.\\"Ninjutsu and Koryu Bujutsu\\"  Martial Arts Database. Mardb.com (19 May 1999). Retrieved on 2012-03-25. There is however, old footage by way of black and white films of Hatsumi and Takamatsu training together over a period of several years. Takamatsu confirmed that Hatsumi had only been training with him since 1958.\\"Shinsetsu Nihon Ninja Retsuden\\", Koyama Ryutaro, 1964, Arechi Shuppansha (publisher). In November 1963, Hatsumi said that he was training with Takamatsu sensei once every three months, but only on weekends.Bugeicyo magazine, November, 1963. Kiyoshi Watatani (editor of the Bugeicyo magazine in 1963), suggested that Masaaki Hatsumi's lineage was not consistent with his claims, and therefore these claims were Hatsumi's notion alone and that he had no proof to back up these claims. A source regarding the history of ninjutsu is the Kakutogi No Rekishi (which lists the Bujinkan Ryuha - Hatsumi's organization) and also mentions the close personal friend of Hatsumi, Yumio Nawa. In 1972, Nawa confirmed the historical status of the 12th century tradition of the togakure ryu.Ninjutsu no kenku, 1972, Ninchibo Shuppansha In 1978, the Bugei Ry≈´ha Daijiten said of the Takamatsu Togakure-ryu, : \\"The genealogy of the Togakure-ryu includes embellishments, to the written traditions and documentation of the school which would suggest that these embellishments were created in order for the tradition to appear older than it actually is.\\" (The 1963 and 1969 versions of the Bugei include similar wording). In Shinobi no sengokushi (August, 2004) Hatsumi said that he had trained under Toshitsugu Takamatsu's tutelage for 15 years and had become a master of 9 individual traditional Japanese schools/systems at the age 27.Shinobino Sengokushi Heisei August, 2004. Masaaki Hatsumi has elected not to pass the system on to an heir. =Jinichi Kawakami= The founder of Banke Shinobinoden school, Jinichi Kawakami, studied with Masazo Ishida. Thomas Dillon wrote, :\\"No one knows anything about Ishida and therefore there is no evidence that Kawakami's claims are correct. How very ninja-like.\\"A story of life, fate, and finding the lost art of koga ninjutsu in Japan, DiMarzio, Daniel, Jinichi Kawakami is supposedly the 21st Grand Master (Soke) of the \\"Koga Ban\\" clan, and the honorary director of the Iga-ryu Ninja Museum. Kawakami runs a dojo in Sagamihara-shi, Kanagawa Prefecture, but no longer accepts new students.\\"Koga Ryu Wada Ha\\" style taught by the late Fujita Seiko, Fujita Seiko by Phillip Hevener Kawakami's student, Yasushi Kiyomoto, is also a teacher of this school. =Frank Dux= The validity of Dux's claims which have been disputed include his martial arts credentials; his fighting in the \\"Kumite\\"; and his prior military service. In 1998, in the Los Angeles superior court, Dux and Jean-Claude Van Damme were opposing litigants.\\"Full Mental Jacket\\" (August 1996) and \\"Stolen Valor: Profiles of a Phony-Hunter\\" (November 1998), Soldier of Fortune In 2004, Ralph Keyes (writer for the LA Times) wrote, :\\"Like Wayland Clifton, Dux even forged a press account of his exploits. Research on these 'exploits' conducted by Los Angeles Times reporter, John Johnson, and phony-veteran unmasker, B.G. 'Jug' Burkett, revealed that Dux had been in the military for only a few months, didn't serve in Southeast Asia, and won no medals. His service record indicates that Dux had been referred for psychiatric evaluation due to 'flights of ideas and exaggerations.\\"Keyes (2004), p. 73.  Roger Small  Roger Small, is a seasoned martial artist with many years of experience in the art of ninjutsu and also various other far eastern fighting arts. From a ninjutsu perspective, Mr Small has never claimed that his \\"Jinkage-Ryu Ninpo Bugei\\" school is a Kory≈´ school, which in itself is quite surprising considering that most ninjutsu practitioners try to make these claims in one way or another. Having researched this school in depth, it has to be said, that although the techniques and skills that are taught in the school are performed from a modern perspective, the underlying principles and movement behind these techniques are unmistakably Ninpo-Taijutsu. Sensei Roger Small has held seminars for Law Enforcement Officers and select members of our British Special Forces. =Timothy Moshimitsu a.k.a. Master Moshi= Not much else is known about him other than somehow being of Japanese and Vietnamese descent. He was a little-known, self-proclaimed, Ninjutsu practitioner who popped up sometime around 1984 in Los Angeles, CA. He did not advertise, nor did he erect a big school. He gave private-lessons in his back yard and mostly applied his skills in Aikido and Jujitsu along with concepts of Ninjutsu. To date, he has never claimed lineage to ancient Ninja schools nor has he claimed lineage to any past historical Ninjutsu figures. He taught what he considered to be the true essence of Ninjutsu which according to him is \\"whatever the Ninja would do if you took a time machine and threw them in today's world\\". =Radford Davis, a.k.a. Ashida Kim= No evidence is available recording where Ashida Kim's training took place, or who trained him. Ashida Kim is the author of a number of books about Ninjitsu including Secrets of the Ninja. Demonstrating his martial arts knowledge in a video interview released on YouTube, Kim says that the first five forms learned in Goju Ryu, Shotokan, Wado Ryu, Isshin Ryu, and \\"hard Korean martial arts\\" are all identical. In 2003, Kim stated in an interview with The Believer magazine, that he has been associated with the Black Dragon Fighting Society (BDFS) since meeting its head, Count Dante, in 1968. In the same article he indicates that the BDFS is descended from a 6,000-year-old Chinese school called the \\"Polestar school\\" which has been preserving knowledge since the fall of Atlantis. Kim's websites were suspended on Oct. 5, 2005, for his illegal use of the BDFS trademarks and copyrights through legal action taken on behalf of Bill Aguiar III (son of William V. Aguiar, who inherited the BDFS after Dante's death), modern-day leader of the BDFS.

The town is famous for Kinhal toys and religious idols. This village is famous for Kinnal Craft. Recently this Craft has been granted Geographical Indication and its GI Application number is 213*. History Kinhal was once a flourishing centre for crafts, the most well-known being carvings in wood. The famous mural paintings in the Pampapateshwara Temple, and the intricate work on the wooden chariot at Hampi, are said to be the work of the ancestors of the Kinhal artisans of today. Old paper tracings found in the ancestral house of one of the artisans further substantiates this belief. In 2007, students from the University of Glasgow and Glasgow School of Art in collaboration with the Crafts Council of Karnataka, facilitated a project with local students and craftsmen, in an attempt to revive the Kinhal craft. Method The artisans are called chitragara. Lightweight wood is used for the toys. The paste used for joining the various parts is made of tamarind seeds and pebbles. Jute rags, soaked, slivered into pieces, dried, powdered, and mixed with saw dust and tamarind seed paste is made into kitta. A mixture of pebble powder paste with liquid gum is used for embossing the ornamentation and jewellery on the body of the figure. Once the components of the figure are assembled, kitta is applied by hand all over, and small pieces of cotton are stuck on it with the tamarind paste. Over this is applied the pebble paste which forms the base for the application of paint. Previously, toys depicting people involved in various occupations were popular; now the preference is for figures, animals, and birds. Garuda, the epic bird, has 12 components while Lord Ganesha on a throne has 22 components. The styling is realistic and the designing and chiselling has a master touch. In the festival season, clay toys and images are made, often out of cowdung and sawdust.

His bardic name is derived from the nom de plume he used whilst writing poetry as a boy, Ieuan Gwyllt Gelltydd Melindwr (John of the Wild Woods near the Mill Tower).\\"Ieuan Gwyllt (John Roberts)\\" at www.canamus.org He was born at Tanrhiwfelen, a house just outside Aberystwyth, and died in Caernarfon on 14 May 1877. He was buried at Caeathro cemetery near Caernarfon. Memorial to Roberts, commemorating his ministry at Panttywyll Calvinistic Methodist church, Merthyr Tydfil. Now in Canolfan Soar, Merthyr Tydfil. Biography Roberts worked as a clerk to a company of dispensing chemists in Aberystwyth, but after two years started to teach at the Skinner Street School. After only a few months, however, he enrolled at the Borough Road Training College in London where he stayed for nine months. On his return to Aberystwyth in 1845 he opened a school. After only nine months there, he left to become clerk to a firm of solicitors where he stayed for nearly seven years. In 1852 he became assistant editor of Yr Amserau, a Welsh newspaper based in Liverpool. On 15 June 1856 he preached his first sermon at Runcorn and in 1858 he moved to Aberdare to edit Y Gwladgarwr (\\"The Patriot\\"). The following year he was married to Jane Richards of Aberystwyth. In 1859 he was asked to become minister of Pant-tywyll Calvinistic Methodist church in Merthyr Tydfil and was ordained on 7 August 1861 at the Newcastle Emlyn Association. Although he composed music from an early age, it was not until 1859 that he produced Llyfr Tonau Cynulleidfaol (\\"Book of Congregational Tunes\\"), a labour of some six years, with whose publication began a new era of Welsh congregational hymn singing. Roberts founded a number of regional musical festivals - the Gwent and Morgannwg in 1854, the G≈µyl Eryri in 1866, and the G≈µyl Ardudwy in 1868. In the 1870s he travelled widely throughout Wales, lecturing on congregational music. From 1861 until 1865 he was the editor and publisher of the Welsh periodical Y Cerddor Cymreig and he remained its editor until 1873. In 1864 he produced a Tonic Sol-fa edition of his own Llyfr Tonau Cynulleidfaol and founded Cerddor y Tonic Solffa in 1869 of which he was editor until 1874. In 1865 he became minister of Capel Coch Calvinistic Methodist church in Llanberis, where he remained until his retirement in 1869 to Y Fron, Llanfaglan, near Caernarvon. In 1874 he issued S≈µn y Jiwbili an arrangement in Welsh of Moody and Sankey hymns and tunes. Roberts was the translator of the Welsh hymns Mae d'eisiau, O mae d'eisiau (written in 1872 by Annie S.

Loosely stated, the orthogonality principle says that the error vector of the optimal estimator (in a mean square error sense) is orthogonal to any possible estimator. The orthogonality principle is most commonly stated for linear estimators, but more general formulations are possible. Since the principle is a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality, it can be used to find the minimum mean square error estimator.  Orthogonality principle for linear estimators  The orthogonality principle is most commonly used in the setting of linear estimation.Kay, p.386 In this context, let x be an unknown random vector which is to be estimated based on the observation vector y. One wishes to construct a linear estimator \\\\hat{x} = Hy + c for some matrix H and vector c. Then, the orthogonality principle states that an estimator \\\\hat{x} achieves minimum mean square error if and only if * \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\\\\\{ (\\\\hat{x} - x ) y^T \\\\\\\\} = 0, and * \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{x} - x \\\\\\\\} = 0. If x and y have zero mean, then it suffices to require the first condition.  Example  Suppose x is a Gaussian random variable with mean m and variance \\\\sigma_x^2. Also suppose we observe a value y=x+w, where w is Gaussian noise which is independent of x and has mean 0 and variance \\\\sigma_w^2. We wish to find a linear estimator \\\\hat{x} = hy+c minimizing the MSE. Substituting the expression \\\\hat{x} = hy + c into the two requirements of the orthogonality principle, we obtain : 0 = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\\\\\{ (\\\\hat{x} - x ) y \\\\\\\\} : 0 = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\\\\\{ (hx+hw+c-x)(x+w) \\\\\\\\} : 0 = h (\\\\sigma_x^2+\\\\sigma_w^2) + hm^2 + cm - \\\\sigma_x^2 -m^2 and : 0 = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\hat{x} - x \\\\\\\\} : 0 = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\\\\\{ hx+hw+c-x \\\\\\\\} : 0 = (h-1)m + c . Solving these two linear equations for h and c results in : h = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x^2}{\\\\sigma_x^2 +\\\\sigma_w^2}, \\\\quad c = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_w^2}{\\\\sigma_x^2+\\\\sigma_w^2} m , so that the linear minimum mean square error estimator is given by : \\\\hat{x} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_x^2}{\\\\sigma_x^2 +\\\\sigma_w^2} y + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_w^2}{\\\\sigma_x^2 +\\\\sigma_w^2} m. This estimator can be interpreted as a weighted average between the noisy measurements y and the prior expected value m. If the noise variance \\\\sigma_w^2 is low compared with the variance of the prior \\\\sigma_x^2 (corresponding to a high SNR), then most of the weight is given to the measurements y, which are deemed more reliable than the prior information. Conversely, if the noise variance is relatively higher, then the estimate will be close to m, as the measurements are not reliable enough to outweigh the prior information. Finally, note that because the variables x and y are jointly Gaussian, the minimum MSE estimator is linear.See the article minimum mean square error. Therefore, in this case, the estimator above minimizes the MSE among all estimators, not only linear estimators.  General formulation  Let V be a Hilbert space of random variables with an inner product defined by \\\\langle x,y \\\\rangle = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\\\\\{ x^H y \\\\\\\\}. Suppose W is a closed subspace of V, representing the space of all possible estimators. One wishes to find a vector \\\\hat{x} \\\\in W which will approximate a vector x \\\\in V. More accurately, one would like to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\ x - \\\\hat{x} \\\\^2 between \\\\hat{x} and x. In the special case of linear estimators described above, the space V is the set of all functions of x and y, while W is the set of linear estimators, i.e., linear functions of y only. Other settings which can be formulated in this way include the subspace of causal linear filters and the subspace of all (possibly nonlinear) estimators. Geometrically, we can see this problem by the following simple case where W is a one-dimensional subspace: center We want to find the closest approximation to the vector x by a vector \\\\hat{x} in the space W. From the geometric interpretation, it is intuitive that the best approximation, or smallest error, occurs when the error vector, e, is orthogonal to vectors in the space W. More accurately, the general orthogonality principle states the following: Given a closed subspace W of estimators within a Hilbert space V and an element x in V, an element \\\\hat{x} \\\\in W achieves minimum MSE among all elements in W if and only if \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\\\\\{ (x-\\\\hat{x}) y^T \\\\\\\\} = 0 for all y \\\\in W. Stated in such a manner, this principle is simply a statement of the Hilbert projection theorem. Nevertheless, the extensive use of this result in signal processing has resulted in the name \\"orthogonality principle.\\"  A solution to error minimization problems  The following is one way to find the minimum mean square error estimator by using the orthogonality principle. We want to be able to approximate a vector x by : x=\\\\hat{x}+e\\\\, where : \\\\hat{x}=\\\\sum_i c_{i}p_{i} is the approximation of x as a linear combination of vectors in the subspace W spanned by p_{1},p_{2},\\\\ldots. Therefore, we want to be able to solve for the coefficients, c_{i}, so that we may write our approximation in known terms. By the orthogonality theorem, the square norm of the error vector, \\\\left\\\\Vert e\\\\right\\\\Vert ^{2}, is minimized when, for all j, : \\\\left\\\\langle x-\\\\sum_i c_{i}p_{i},p_{j}\\\\right\\\\rangle =0. Developing this equation, we obtain : \\\\left\\\\langle x,p_{j}\\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\sum_i c_{i}p_{i},p_{j}\\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\sum_i c_{i}\\\\left\\\\langle p_{i},p_{j}\\\\right\\\\rangle. If there is a finite number n of vectors p_i, one can write this equation in matrix form as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left\\\\langle x,p_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle x,p_{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle x,p_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left\\\\langle p_{1},p_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{2},p_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\cdots & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{n},p_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle p_{1},p_{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{2},p_{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\cdots & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{n},p_{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle p_{1},p_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{2},p_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\cdots & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{n},p_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} c_{1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{n}\\\\end{bmatrix}. Assuming the p_i are linearly independent, the Gramian matrix can be inverted to obtain : \\\\begin{bmatrix} c_{1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_{n}\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left\\\\langle p_{1},p_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{2},p_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\cdots & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{n},p_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle p_{1},p_{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{2},p_{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\cdots & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{n},p_{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle p_{1},p_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{2},p_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle & \\\\cdots & \\\\left\\\\langle p_{n},p_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left\\\\langle x,p_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle x,p_{2}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle x,p_{n}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\end{bmatrix}, thus providing an expression for the coefficients c_i of the minimum mean square error estimator.

Ivan Alexandrovich Balakirev was a trusted servant of Peter I and Catherine I since 1699. In the time of the empress Anne he became an official court buffoon. One of the version around the Balakirev surname etymology is that it formed from Bala kire, a tatar for stubborn kid. Ksenofont Polevoy published a book entitled Collection of anecdotes by Balakirev, using the real name of Ivan Balakirev as his pseudonym. It's in fact a collection from various people and sources.

The term has been used in English since at least 1560. It arises in hereditary monarchies in Europe and is also used to describe a number of similar yet distinct monarchical concepts in non-European cultures around the world. \\" Queen Mother\\" usually refers to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (queen consort, 1936‚Äì1952; queen mother, 1952‚Äì2002), who was the mother of Queen Elizabeth II and held the status of queen mother for 50 years. Status A widowed queen consort, or dowager queen, has an important royal position (whether or not she is the mother of the reigning sovereign) but does not normally have any rights to succeed a king as monarch on his death unless she happens to be next in line to the throne (one possibility would be if the King and Queen were also cousins and childless, the King had no other siblings, and she in her other position as his cousin was also his heiress presumptive). A new reigning king would have (at accession or eventually) a wife who would be the new queen consort; and, of course, a queen regnant would also be called 'Queen'. More to the point, there may be more than one queen dowager at any given time. Britain The widowed mother of Queen Elizabeth II was known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The title \\"queen mother\\" evolved to distinguish a queen dowager from all other queens when she is also the mother of the reigning sovereign. Thus, upon the death of her husband, King George V, Queen Mary became queen mother, retaining the status throughout the reigns of her sons, Edward VIII and George VI. The title also distinguishes former queens consort from those who are simply the mother of the current monarch. For example, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was \\"the Queen's mother\\" when her daughter Victoria became queen regnant, but she was not \\"queen mother\\". The title in British usage is purely a courtesy title. While the wife of a king is called \\"queen\\", there is no constitutional or statutory recognition of \\"queen mother\\" as a title. There is no male equivalent to a queen mother (i.e. \\"king father\\"). This would occur only if the husband of a queen regnant outlived the queen and was thereafter father to the new king or queen. Such a situation has never occurred. Since the title \\"queen mother\\" derives from the woman's previous title of \\"queen\\", it would also be incongruous to call such a father of a monarch the \\"king father\\", as the husbands of queens regnant are not called \\"king\\", but rather \\"prince consort\\". The exact title such a person would assume has not been clarified by royal lineage experts. \\"Prince father\\" is a possibility.U.S. National Archives, \\"When Queen Elizabeth Dies\\", Prologue Magazine, Summer 1998 Ottoman Empire In the Ottoman Empire, Valide sultan () or Sultana mother was the title held by the mother of a ruling Sultan. The title was first used in the 16th century for Hafsa Sultan, consort of Selim I and mother of Suleiman the Magnificent, superseding the previous title of mehd-i √ºlya (\\"cradle of the great\\"). The Turkish pronunciation of the word Valide is . The position was perhaps the most important position in the Ottoman Empire after the sultan himself. As the mother to the sultan, by Islamic tradition (\\"A mother's right is God's right\\"), the valide sultan would have a significant influence on the affairs of the empire. She had great power in the court and her own rooms (always adjacent to her son's) and state staff. In particular during the 17th century, in a period known as the \\"Sultanate of Women\\", a series of incompetent or child sultans raised the role of the valide sultan to new heights.Peirce, Leslie P., The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, Oxford University Press, 1993, (paperback) Ancient Israel The Israelites had in the Kingdom of Judah a title called \\"Gebirah\\" which can be translated to Queen Mother. The mother of the Jewish Monarch was given high rank and status among the Israelites. Other oriental monarchies In India, a queen (usually styled rani, or in the Muslim tradition, begum) who becomes queen-mother is known in Hindi as a rajmata - literally, mother of the state (raj). African monarchies In Eswatini, the queen mother, or Ndlovukati, reigns alongside her son. She serves as a ceremonial figurehead, while her son serves as the administrative head of state. He has absolute power. She is important at festivals such as the annual reed dance ceremony. In many matrilineal societies of West Africa, such as the Ashanti, the queen mother is the one through whom royal descent is reckoned and thus wields considerable power. One of the greatest leaders of Ashanti was Nana Yaa Asantewaa (1840‚Äì1921), who led her subjects against the British Empire during the War of the Golden Stool in 1900. In more symbolically driven societies such as the kingdoms of the Yoruba peoples, the queen mother may not even be a blood relative of the reigning monarch. She could be a female individual of any age who is vested with the ritual essence of the departed queens in a ceremonial sense, and who is practically regarded as the monarch's mother as a result. A good example of this is Oloye Erelu Kuti of Lagos, who has been seen as the iya oba or queen mother of every succeeding king of that realm, due to the activities of the three successors to her noble title that have reigned since her demise.

However, though she has been called the King Mother in biographical literature, she was never officially recognized as queen or queen mother.Grethe Auth√©n Blom Norsk Historisk Tidskrift Oslo 1981 p. 425 *Her granddaughter-in-law Margaret (1353‚Äì1412), who ruled all of Scandinavia as the mother of one king and the adoptive mother of another, held a similarly complicated unofficial position but for much longer, and in traditional history is given the title of Queen. Early in her career, she had been Queen consort of Norway for seventeen years and of Sweden for one year. *Jijabai (1598‚Äì1674) was neither consort of a ruling king nor a ruling queen or regent. In practical terms her husband Shahaji was a nobleman under other rulers, but her son founded an independent empire and became its sovereign. Hence she is given the title Queen Mother ‚Äì Rajmata in Hindi. *Sadij√© Toptani (1876‚Äì1934), mother of King Zog I of Albania: after her son became king in 1928 she was raised to the title Queen Mother of the Albanians (N√´na Mbret√´resh√´ e Shqiptar√´ve) with the style of Her Majesty, a position she held from September 1, 1928, until her death. *Helen of Greece and Denmark was the wife of the future Carol II of Romania from 1921 to 1928, and mother of King Michael of Romania. Michael first ruled 1927‚Äì30, before his father was king, and again after his father abdicated. When in 1930 Carol returned to Romania and assumed the throne, he actually retrodated his reign to 1927, the year his father (King Ferdinand) died. As Helen had not yet divorced her playboy husband at the time (that was to happen in the following year), he unwittingly granted her the retroactive title of queen. Thus, in 1940, after his abdication and the second accession of their son, she rightfully became the queen mother of Romania. *Similarly, Gayatri Devi, Maharani of Jaipur (1919‚Äì2009) was the third wife of her husband, the monarch, but not the mother of his successor, a son by the king's first wife. However, she has been accorded the title of queen mother (Rajmata) anyway. *The Valide Sultan or Sultana mother was title which usually held by the mother of the reigning Ottoman Sultan, even though she may never have been chief consort (haseki sultan). *Shubhadrangi was mother of future emperor Ashoka, but was murdered by Susima in order to save her daughter in law. She was not able to be empress mother (rajmata) *Helena Maurya, the second wife of Chandragupta Maurya, was step mother of Bindusara, and held the title of Rajmata until her death. King father If a king were to abdicate and pass the throne to his child, then in that case the king could have his son or daughter style him as a king father. King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia was styled as HM King Father Norodom Sihanouk when he abdicated in favor of his son. When King Albert II of the Belgians abdicated in 2013 his style shortened to His Majesty King Albert (as did King Leopold III); \\"king father\\" is the name of his role rather than forming part of his style or title. Currently, Jigme Singye Wangchuck is the king father of Bhutan. A similar title of Father Emir is now held by Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani of Qatar. When Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III of Brunei abdicated, he became the Begawan Sultan or the Sultan Father or Begawan Sultan. He was given the title of His Majesty the Sultan-Father or in Malay was Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan and this office became vacant when he died. Francis, Duke of C√°diz, king consort of Isabel II of Spain, was king father to Alfonso XII of Spain and later king grandfather to Alfonso XIII of Spain. Ferdinand II of Portugal, jure uxoris king to Maria II of Portugal, was king father to Pedro V of Portugal and Lu√≠s I of Portugal. Following his abdication, Ludwig I of Bavaria was king father to Maximilian II of Bavaria and later king grandfather to Ludwig II of Bavaria. In the former Chinese Empire, a living monarch who passed the throne to his son was called Taishang Huang. This title was last bestowed upon Qianlong Emperor.

It can be found in Southern Europe, North Africa, Anatolia and the Caucasus. Recently it has been introduced into Japan, Chile and Argentina.University of California Integrated Pest Management Description Lobesia botrana can reach a length of , with a wingspan of 12‚Äì13 mm. The females are slightly larger. The external surface of the forewings is mottled with tan-brown, greyish and dark-brown blotches. The rear wings are gray with a fringed border. Larvae can reach a length of . They are yellowish green to light brown with a light yellow head. Biology The larvae mainly feed on the flowers and fruit of grape (Vitis vinifera) and spurge laurel (Daphne gnidium), but it has also been reported on several other plants (Rubus fruticosus, Ribes sp., Olea europaea, Prunus avium, Prunus domestica, Actinidia chinensis, Punica granatum, etc.). Lobesia botrana normally has two - three generations in Europe. Larvae develop in 20 to 30 days. Pupae overwinter inside a silken cocoon. This species is considered a major vineyard pest in its native range, as the larvae feed on the interior of grapes, hollow them out and leave excrement. An invasive species The moth was found in the Napa Valley of California in October 2009, the first record in the United States. Confirmation of that detection led to increased trapping and surveys that have since detected the pest at several sites in the county. On March 9, 2010, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) announced it had established a quarantine of including portions of Napa, Sonoma and Solano counties. The quarantine affects movement of host material from inside the infested area. As of May 12, 2010, Fresno county was also placed under quarantine after traps near Kingsburg, California contained two specimens within of one another. Mexico has also notified the USDA that no fruit from this county will be accepted for import into Mexico which will greatly impact California stonefruit and grapes. In August 2016, with no moths found since June 2014, the state declared that Napa County, and California, were free of the invasive species.Napa Valley Register Bibliography *Coscoll√° Ram√≥n R. 1998.

He suffered an injury in his debut for the team and had to return in the next season with only 1 cap. Altogether he has made around 1900 minutes of play for the Belgian Champs in the Belgian league.

In 2008, Cor didn't even have a contract at Anderlecht, he was there simply as a youth player who sometimes trained with the first squad, although he was a member of their reserve team. He was hoping for some playing minutes in the Belgian cup, but never played as Anderlecht bought a new defender. Then went from R.S.C. Anderlecht to K.V. Mechelen on 27 January 2009. International The 2007‚Äì2008 season saw him make more appearances with Anderlecht and make his way into the Belgian U-17s (now in the Belgian U-20s).

It was dedicated to \\"Our Blessed Saviour, St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Egelwine\\". History Origins Originally Athelney was a small island in swampland, in what is now the parish of East Lyng, covered with alders and infested by wild animals. It was inaccessible except by boat, according to William of Malmesbury. Here Alfred the Great found a refuge from the Danes; here he built the abbey. The dedication to St. √Üthelwine suggests that it may have been an enlargement of a hermitage or monastery already in existence. He peopled it with foreign monks, drawn chiefly from France, with John the Old Saxon (known as Scotus) as their abbot. The original church was a small structure, consisting of four piers supporting the main fabric and surrounded by four circular chancels. The original charter from Alfred still exists.Somers. Rec. Soc. Publ. xiv, 126. Norman era From the 11th century up to the time of its dissolution the monks of Glastonbury Abbey attempted to annex it or have it placed under the Glastonbury jurisdiction. The abbey also appears in the Domesday book,Somers. Rec. Soc. Publ. xiv, 126. From: 'Houses of Benedictine monks: The abbey of Athelney', A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 2 (1911), pp. 99-103. and the Taxatio of 1291. In 1267, Henry III granted the abbey a weekly market on Mondays.Chart R. 52 Hen. III, m. 11, no. 147. However, it was not a rich community. An indulgence of thirty days was given in 1321 for those who should assist in the rebuilding of the church, and the monks humbly petitioned Edward I of England to remit corrody for which they were unable to find the means of payment. The last abbot was Robert Hamlyn. With eight monks of his community, he surrendered February 8, 1540, receiving a pension of ¬£50 per annum and retaining his prebend of Long Sutton. The revenues (26 Hen. VII) were ¬£209. 0s. 3/4 d. Both the 1267 charter of Henry III, and latter Henry VII also still exist.

Burials *√Üthelwine of Athelney Post dissolution Following the dissolution it was acquired for use as a private residence by Lord Audley who had the church demolished. Audley's plans never eventuated and records show that on 17 August 1544Orig. R. 36 Henry VIII, vol. 100, fol. 3. Audley sold the abbey to John Clayton, for ¬£182 15s. and in April 1545Orig. R. 36 Hen. VIII, vol. 60, fol. 6. Clayton obtained a licence to sell it to John Tynbere. In 1674 further demolition work occurred by labourers of the then landowner, Captain John Hucker. In this work, excavations dug-up the bases of the pillars of the church and also revealed graves, one being 8-foot in length. With the church demolished and other buildings fallen into disrepair, nothing visible remains at the site today. Several geophysical surveys have been carried out to explore the remains which still exist below ground level. Today the site of the Abbey is marked by King Alfred's Monument which is a Grade II listed building, and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The monument was built in 1801 by Sir John Slade of Maunsel House, who owned Athelney farm.

It is found in Europe.  Morphology  The wingspan is 12‚Äì16 mm. Front wings are dark brown or brown gray with metallic shine. There are some light stripes (7‚Äì12) near the front wing border, decreased from external border to its base. Between stripes dark touches are located, perpendicular to external border. Some dark spots and white comma-like spots are near the hind wing border. Hind wings are white yellow (brown near hind border). Biology The larvae feed on pea, Lathyrus and Vicia. The species is considered to be a pest. The oval egg (0.75‚Äì0.8 mm) is flattened on one side. At first, it has a white color and then it becomes yellow. In the end the color turns dark. The larva reaches 14 mm long. At first it is white, then yellow with dark head and anal scutellum. It has eight lines of dark warts with hairs. Larva also has eight pairs of legs (three pairs on thorax). The body length of yellow-brown pupae varies from 5 to 7 mm. The over-wintering takes place during the phase of fifth- instar larvae, within a dense oval cocoon in the ground on fields of pea, lentil, peavine and vetch. An insignificant number of caterpillars over-winter in places where grain is dried and threshed. The insects pupate, in their cocoons, underground during the month of May. The pupae period lasts 10‚Äì18 days. The first moths appear during the period of wild vetch and pea-vine blooming. When first buds appear, the moths are found on pea. After coupling, which takes place four to seven days after emergence from the cocoon, the insects begin to lay eggs. Additional feeding on pea flowers is preferred. Moths fly in the evening; they live 10‚Äì14 days. Mass oviposition occurs at the beginning of July. The oviposition lasts 25‚Äì30 days. Pests lay eggs in groups of one, two or three (rarely four) on upper leaves (lower side), peduncle, bell, stems. Embryonic development lasts 6‚Äì10 days. Fecundity reaches 200 eggs. Hatching caterpillars penetrate into the pods and gnaw grains from above, making wide channels, ending in a hollow at one end. They soil the grain with fecal masses and cobwebs. Usually, one, rarely two or more (up to four) caterpillars are located in pods. The entire larval period (lasting 16‚Äì25 days) occurs inside one pod. The larvae have five instars, four molts. Then the insect makes a hole in the pod wall and comes out, making a cocoon in the ground. This take place when the pods become mature and the plants become dry (from the end of July and up to the first ten-day period of September). Young caterpillars (not fifth instar) that did not finish their feeding can diapause, but eventually they perish.

Petri introduced the term ‚ÄúPragmatic Semantic Unification‚Äù to refer to the approaches in which the results are tested against a running application using the semantic mappings. In this pragmatic approach, the accuracy of the mapping is not as important as its usability. In general, the Semantic Unification in business processes is the process to find a common unified concept that match two lexicalized expressions into the same interpretation.

It is found today all over the subtropical and tropical regions of the world and even occurs on many oceanic islands - in Polynesia and Saint Helena for example - but has probably been accidentally introduced to much of its current range by humans. In addition, it is also found in some cooler regions, e.g. in Europe except in the east and north; this is probably also not natural, as it was, for example, not recorded in the British Isles before 1900.Clarke (1986), FE (2009), Kimber [2011] It is the type species of its genus Crocidosema, established by Philipp Christoph Zeller when he described the present species in 1847, as he found it unlike any moth then known to science.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004a) Description and ecology The wingspan of adults is 12‚Äì16 mm. In the seasonal parts of its range, this moth flies from midsummer to early autumn, e.g. from July to October in southern England. It is not quite clear whether there are several broods per year in the tropics, as it has been recorded on the Marquesas Islands only between January and April for example. The adults are active in the evening and are attracted to lights.Clarke (1986), Kimber [2011] The larvae mainly feed inside the seed capsules and shoots of Malvaceae such as China jute (Abutilon theophrasti), marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis), the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea), arrowleaf sida (Sida rhombifolia), and various Gossypium (cottons) and Malva (typical mallows) species. The caterpillars have been found on other eurosids, including Crataegus hawthorns (Rosaceae), Cucurbita pepo pumpkins (Cucurbitaceae), and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae). They may occasionally become pests of cotton. Synonyms This species was described time and again under different names from all over its wide range. But not even subspecies are accepted today, rendering all those other names invalid. In addition, it was variously assigned to other tortrix moth genera - usually close relatives of Crocidosema such as Epinotia (under its junior synonyms Paedisca, Proteopteryx and Steganoptycha) or Eucosma, but sometimes more distantly related Olethreutinae such as Grapholita (under the spelling variant Grapholitha) and Hedya (as Penthina, a misspelling of the junior synonym Pendina). In addition to being the type species of Crocidosema, one of these redescriptions - at that time still unrecognized as what it was - was used as late as 1965 to establish the genus Parasuleima as supposedly distinct from Crocidosema.Clarke (1986), Pitkin & Jenkins (2004b), Baixeras et al.

She was the first American woman to win an Olympic event: the women's golf tournament at the 1900 Paris Games.  Early life  Born in Calcutta, Abbot was the daughter of Charles and Mary Abbott. Charles died when Margaret was very young and after his death, Mary moved the family to Boston. When Abbott was a teenager, her mother became the literary editor of The Chicago Herald and the family then moved to Illinois. After moving to Illinois, she and her mother were members of the Chicago Golf Club. After she took up the game, she was winning championships at local tournaments and was reported to have a two handicap.  Paris Olympics  Mary and Margaret Abbott lived in Paris from 1899 to 1902. While in Paris, Mary researched a travel guide and Margaret studied art with Rodin and Degas. At the 1900 Paris Olympics, 22 women competed out of a total 997 athletes. It was the first time women were allowed to compete in the Olympic Games. The 1900 Olympics stretched over six months and were something of a sideshow of the Paris Exhibition. The events were referred to as the Championnats Internationaux, or International Championship, instead of the Olympic Games.https://www.golfhistorie.no/assets/files/2010-2020/golf-and-the-olympic- games-bill-malone.pdf The women's golf tournament was held on October 4, 1900 at a nine-hole course at Compi√®gne, north of Paris. Golf Illustrated referred to the medal event as \\"The international golf competition recently held... in connection with the Paris Exhibition.\\" The games were organized and publicized so poorly that many competitors, including the Abbotts, did not realize that the events they entered were part of the Olympics. Historical research did not establish that the game was on the Olympic program until after Abbott's death in 1955, so she never knew it. Additionally, Abbott's victory was not well known until a University of Florida professor and member of the Olympic Board of Directors, Paula Welch, researched the golfer and began to put together pieces of Abbott's life. She examined newspaper articles that mentioned Abbott's successes in various golfing competitions in an attempt to gain more information. She also located Abbott's children and informed them of their mother's victory. https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-first-american- woman-to-win-an-olympic-championship-didnt-even-know-it Part of the reason Abbott was not widely known was due to the fact that she had not been an official member of the U.S. Olympic team when it was organized in the United States. This was due to the fact she was residing in France and studying art while her mother was working there as a writer. Abbott competed because she played golf and happened to be in France. Her mother also competed in the event. In the 1890s, Abbott initially learned to play the sport as a member of the Chicago Golf Club where her mother, also a member, played the sport. She won the Olympics with a 9-hole score of 47. Abbott was awarded a porcelain bowl for first place in golf. The 1900 Games were the only Olympics at which winners received valuable artifacts instead of medals. Metal prizes were not awarded at those games, an anomaly in the history of the modern Olympic events. All the competitors played in long skirts and fashionable hats, but according to Abbott, some \\"apparently misunderstood the nature of the game scheduled for the day and turned up to play in high heels and tight skirts.\\" Mary Abbott also entered the competition. She shot a 9-hole score of 65 and finished tied for seventh. This was the only time in Olympic history that a mother and daughter competed in the same sport in the same event at the same Olympics. Women's golf would not be seen again at the Olympics until the 2016 Games in Rio.  Later life and legacy  Margaret Abbott married the writer Finley Peter Dunne on December 10, 1902. They had four children together: Finley Peter Dunne Jr., Peggy Dunne, Leonard Dunne, and Phillip Dunne, who later became a noted screenwriter. Abbott continued to play golf as she helped raise her children. Abbott died at age 76 on June 10, 1955 in Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1996, Abbot was the featured athlete of the 1900 Olympic Games in the official Olympic program of the Atlanta games. In 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for her.

Its head was the Prior of Durham. It was founded in 1083 as a Roman Catholic monastery, but after Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 the priory was dissolved and the cathedral was taken over by the Church of England. Historically, Durham Priory was one of the most important land owners in County Durham along with the Bishop of Durham until the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. Until then, Durham Priory was home to between 50 and 100 Benedictine monks. Durham was the largest and richest of the monasteries associated with Durham; the other cells were in Coldingham Priory (until 1462), Jarrow and Monk Wearmouth, Finchale, Farne, Holy Island, Lythe, Stamford and Durham College, Oxford (after 1381). The Bishop of Durham was the temporal lord of the palatinate, often referred to as a Prince-bishop. The bishop competed for power with the Prior of Durham who held his own courts for his free tenants. An agreement dated about 1229, known as Le Convenit was entered into to regulate the relationship between the two magnates.Abstract from: Cynthia J. Neville, The Courts of the Prior and the Bishop of Durham in the Later Middle Ages, 2002 After the Benedictine monastery was dissolved, the last Prior of Durham, Hugh Whitehead, became the first dean of the cathedral's secular chapter. Durham Priory held many manuscripts; in the 21st century, steps were under way to digitise the books, originating from the 6th to the 16th century, owned by the Benedictine monastery. The project was being undertaken in a partnership by Durham University and Durham Cathedral.

History The Old Merensky Library The original library was initially established and housed in the Old Arts building in 1911 before being relocated to the Old Merensky Library, University of Pretoria. The construction of the Old Merensky Library was made possible through a generous donation of ¬£10 000 by geologist Dr Hans Merensky, as well as donations from the Jewish Community of Pretoria, donations from University staff and students, a contribution from the City Council and an anonymous friend of the University. The cornerstone of the building was laid by General Jan Smuts on 11 October 1937. Despite expansions to the Old Merensky Library, University of Pretoria in 1957, it soon became too small and the firm Lou, Marais, Marquard and Kuhn was appointed in 1969 to design a new library.

It provides a military education in order to train and teach military officers who enter the officer corps.  History  In 1918, following the First World War, the school moved to Versailles and diversified by including in its ranks officers from other armies. It was not until 1937 that the school was given a flag. This emblem was officially handed over to the chef de corps, Colonel Picot, 14 July 1937, on the Champs-√âlys√©es by the President Albert Lebrun. During the Second World War, the school moved to Pau then back to Paris before finding its current home in the Augereau barracks in Melun on 1 October 1945. The year 2002 is particularly important for the history of the School. Indeed, from this date, recruitment is carried out directly by competitive examination for academics holding a Master's degree. On 1 September 2008, it became the sole crucible for the continuous training of Gendarmerie officers, both in the operational and support fields. A research centre was also created on 1 September 2008. Application Cadets are recruited through a national annual competitive exam, after previous graduate education.

Palm is often referred to as the \\"father of Cura√ßao's classical music\\". Biography Born in Cura√ßao, Palm had directed several music ensembles by a relatively young age. In 1859, he was appointed music director of the citizen's guard orchestra in Cura√ßao. Palm played several musical instruments such as piano, organ, lute, clarinet, flute and mandolin. As an organist, Palm played for many years in the Jewish synagogue Emanu-El and Mikv√© Israel, the Protestant Fort Church and the Lodge Igualdad in Cura√ßao. He was also a regular contributor to the widely read and influential periodical Notas y Letras (Notes and Letters). This periodical was issued in Cura√ßao in the period 1886‚Äì1888, with numerous subscribers throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. When Palm died at the age of 75, on 13 December 1906, gifted musicians and composers of the Palm family such as Rudolph Palm (1880‚Äì1950), John Palm (1885‚Äì1925), Toni Palm (1885‚Äì1963) and Jacobo Palm (1887‚Äì1982) followed in the footsteps set by their maestro and grandfather and further passed this tradition on to their own descendants such as Albert Palm (1903‚Äì1958), Edgar Palm (1905‚Äì1998) and Robert Rojer (1939). Compositions As a composer, Palm can be characterized as both original and productive. One of his well-known statements used to be that a good composition should include at least one surprising change. Palm wrote more than 180 compositions. His waltzes and mazurkas can be characterized by a rich use of harmonic variations. His polkas, marches and galop reveal his buoyant life style. Palm was also often progressive, in the sense of not being afraid of using chords that were relatively unusual for his time. The rhythms that he wrote for each of his danzas are typically complex, very creole and sensual. In the dominantly prudish 19th century, Jan Gerard Palm was the only composer who dared to write erotic tumbas. Alongside dance music written for the piano, Palm also wrote larger works for the orchestra and for piano and violin. Examples of the latter are the fantasies and serenades. Finally he also wrote several pieces for services in the synagogue, the protestant church and the Lodge.

History of Discovery  In the late 1990s, a local Nazareth couple, Elias and Martina Shama discovered pipes in their wall, and a portion of a tunnel. Digging through the wall, they discovered underground passages that, upon further digging revealed a vast underground complex. According to Under Nazareth, Secrets in Stone (Dec 17, 2002, International Herald Tribune): :‚ÄúShama called in the Antiquities Authority whose officers told him he had found an Ottoman bathhouse, little more than a century old and of minimal interest. So Shama continued digging out the storage room and the cellar under his shop. After three years Shama had unearthed a beautiful high-vaulted room where he offered visitors coffee before guiding them through the hypocaust, the underfloor heating channels, to see the remains of a white marble floor supported by tile columns meeting in a complex array of arches. :The story might have ended there but for Shama's unshakable conviction that his discovery was no legacy from the Turkish invaders. A deeply religious Christian Arab, he was plagued by dreams of Jesus sitting in his bathhouse. He visited neighboring ancient sites to make comparisons. The Antiquities Authority's verdict seemed more and more implausible to him. :He found an ally in a senior archaeologist, Tzvi Shacham of Tel Aviv's Antiquities Museum, who visited the shop and advised the authority that Shama had found a much rarer bathhouse, from the Crusader period and some 1,000 years old.‚Äù A North American research team conducted high-resolution ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys at a number of locations in and around Mary‚Äôs Well in 2004-5 to determine appropriate locations for further digging to be conducted beneath the bathhouse. Samples were collected for radio-carbon dating and the initial data from GPR readings seem to confirm the presence of additional subterranean structures. In 2003, archaeologist Richard Freund stated his belief that the site was clearly of Roman-era origins: \\"\\"I am sure that what we have here is a bathhouse from the time of Jesus,\\" he says, \\"and the consequences of that for archaeology, and for our knowledge of the life of Jesus, are enormous.\\" Carbon 14 dating was done on 3 samples of charcoal, each was found to come from a very different time period, indicating the bath house had been used in multiple periods, and at least was used sometime between 1300-1400, although with only 3 samples dated, it is possible for the bath house to be older.Report: NAZARETH BATH RADIOCARBON SAMPLES FROM 2003 EXCAVATION, by Dr. Elisabetta Boaretto  References   External links  * Official Bath House Website Former public baths Buildings and structures in Nazareth Public baths in the Arab world ","title":"Ancient Bath House of Nazareth"},{"id":"18824354","text":"Bactra lancealana is a moth of the family Tortricidae found in Europe.

The U.S. offshore drilling debate is an ongoing debate in the United States on whether or not, the extent to which, in which areas, and under what conditions, further offshore drilling should be allowed in U.S.-administered waters. Oil drilling platform about two miles (3 km) off the coast of California, near Santa Barbara. The issue saw increased coverage when President George W. Bush in July 2008 lifted a 1990 executive order by George H. W. Bush banning offshore drilling, while at the same time calling for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The issue of offshore drilling became central in the 2008 presidential election, not least because of the oil price increases since 2003. It is also being debated in terms of both environmental issues and U.S. energy independence. As of September 2008, President Barack Obama was for limited offshore drilling as part of an extensive energy independence overhaul. Bush's energy policy was named \\"drill and veto\\" by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands (DRILL) Act (H.R. 6515) is one of the bills discussed in the Congress about drilling. In Florida, many counties, cities, chambers of commerce, and other local agencies have passed resolutions against oil drilling in Florida waters.Map of Resolutions Passed Against Offshore Oil Drilling in Florida http://www.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl;=en&msa;=0&msid;=106172446447503097421.000480838fe1fe5d92709&z;=6 On March 31, 2010, President Obama announced that he was opening new areas in U.S. coastal waters to offshore drilling for gas and oil. This was in stark contrast to his reaction only a few weeks later to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that has become the largest offshore oil spill in United States history. In November 2010, the Obama administration rescinded the decision to open new areas. Background As interpreted by the federal courts, the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution gives the federal government certain regulatory power over \\"navigable waters\\" of the United States. The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 and Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, along with the 1960 Supreme Court decision in United States v. States of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, divided ownership of the tidelands of the United States between state and federal governments. States own the sea and seabed out to , except Texas and Florida which own out to . The federal government owns the remainder of the territorial waters. The 28 January 1969 blowout at a Unocal rig, which spilled of petroleum off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, resulted in drilling bans in offshore California and Florida. Offshore drilling has continued in offshore Texas and Louisiana. In 2006, an area in the Gulf of Mexico known as lease 181 was opened for exploration. The existing moratorium on leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf expired in 2012, and the debate is on whether or not to extend it. In 2018, a new federal initiative to expand offshore drilling suddenly excluded Florida, but although this would be favored by Floridians, concerns remain about the basis for that apparently arbitrary exception being merely politically motivated and tentative. No scientific, military, or economic basis for the decision was given, provoking continuing public concern in Florida.Compton, Glenn, 10 Reasons Not to Drill for Oil Offshore of Florida, The Bradenton Times, Sunday, January 14, 2018 Positive Effects of Off-Shore Oil Rigs Energy independence Imported crude oil as a percent of U.S. consumption. A common argument in favor of offshore drilling is it reduces United States dependency on imported oil. Geopolitically, the U.S. would be less vulnerable to sanctions by oil-producing countries hostile to the United States. It would also make the United States less vulnerable to a stop in a country's oil exports, due to, for example, a civil war or an invasion of that country. The debate often makes references to the 1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis. Fuel price One motivation of increased offshore drilling is to reduce the current fuel prices. In 2007, the Energy Information Administration at the U.S. Dep. of Energy analyzed the effect of lifting the ban on oil and gas leasing on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. With leasing beginning in 2012, the agency projected that production of oil would not be expected to start before 2017, and that as a result US oil production by 2030 would be 7% higher than it would be otherwise. The effect on fuel prices, however, would be \\"insignificant.\\" The Natural Resources Defense Council estimated that with increased offshore leasing and drilling, the price of oil would only drop about 3‚Äì4 cents in 15 to 20 years. Trade deficit Oil produced from offshore drilling reduces oil imports, and thus lessens the U.S. trade deficit. From mid-2017 to early 2018, crude oil imports increased from $45 per barrel to $62 per barrel. Given that the trade deficit was already massive before its increase due to increasing oil prices, it is important to consider all options to lower the deficit including expanded national oil production. Negative Effects of Off-Shore Oil Rigs Military training In 2005, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld stated that offshore drilling would disrupt military training and weapons testing, if done in an area of the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Florida. International Relations Although offshore drilling has long been banned in federal waters off the state of Florida, Cuba has been drilling its own offshore area near Florida.Time (23 October 2008): How Cuba's oil could change the US embargo. Retrieved 17 December 2008. The subject became an issue in the 2008 presidential race, with assertions and denials of the reality of Cuban offshore drilling. On 31 October 2008, Brazilian and Cuban presidents Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva and Raul Castro attended a ceremony at which the Brazilian oil company Petrobras agreed to drill for oil in Cuban offshore waters near Florida.\\"Petrobras signs with Cuba\\", World Oil, December 2008, p.109. By May 2011 Petrobas had withdrawn from the agreement due to poor prospects. More recently, Russia has begun drilling in the Black Sea with a Chinese-made oil rig, Scarabeo 9. Since the rig wasn't built in the U.S. and was agreed to before the imposition of additional sanctions by the E.U. in 2014, Russia has been able to avoid sanctions and operate the rig. Oil spills Offshore facilities pose an environmental risk of oil spills. On April 20, 2010, an underwater blowout and subsequent explosion and fire destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig owned by Transocean Ltd. and operating in the Gulf of Mexico under lease to energy giant BP, resulting in the largest oil spill in United States history. Five million barrels of oil were spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, leading to $21.5 billion (or $4300 per barrel) of clean-up costs paid by BP. BP Oil spill costs broken down by category  Endangered species  The federal Minerals Management Service gave permission to BP and dozens of other oil companies to drill in the Gulf of Mexico without first getting required permits that assesses threats to endangered species. In the aftermath of the BP Oil spill, BP was sued by the Defenders of Wildlife and the Southern Environmental Law Center for imperiling 32 threatened or endangered species. These included the sperm whale, gulf sturgeon, manatee and five kinds of sea turtles, in addition to the surrounding water and habitats that were damaged. With every oil spill, endangered species in the area get closer to extinction. Public opinion Polls by independent national polling concerns in the US generally show fluctuating public opinions of offshore drilling in the last decade. The Pew Research Center, which had documented a large and sharp drop in support for allowing more offshore drilling following the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 (down to 44% in favor versus 52% against), found that by March 2012, support for increased offshore drilling had returned to its pre-Deepwater Horizon level, with 65% in favor versus 31% against.Pew Research Center, As prices pinch, support for oil and gas production grows, 19 Mar. 2012. A series of CNN polls 2008-2011 showed that support for increased offshore drilling dropped from 75% before the Deepwater Horizon spill to 57% shortly after. By April 2011, support had increased to 69%, versus 31% opposed.CNN Opinion Research Corp., , 19 Apr. 2011. The Gallup organization found 50% support for increased offshore drilling in May 2010, a month after the Deepwater Horizon explosion. By March 2011, that support had increased to 60% in favor versus 37% opposed.Lydia Saad, U.S. Oil drilling gains favor with Americans, Gallup, 14 Mar. 2011. A more recent study conducted in 2018 by the Pew Research Center found that 51% of Americans now oppose expanded offshore oil rigs versus 42% favoring expanded offshore oil rigs. This represents a 10% decline in those favoring offshore oil rigs since 2014. Generally, people who live within 25 miles of the coastline oppose offshore oil drilling more so than those who live farther from the coast. Also, Democrats oppose additional rig development at a rate of 71%, while only 22% of Democrats favor more offshore oil rigs. On the other hand, 70% of Republicans favor increased offshore drilling in comparison to 25% opposition. Lastly, younger people (aged 18‚Äì49) oppose increased offshore drilling at a rate of 58%, compared to only 42% opposition for people aged older than 49.

Furthermore, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land has opened up since the enactment of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. In Scotland the ancient tradition of universal access to land was formally codified under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. In Northern Ireland however, there are few rights of way, or other access to land. Walking is used in the United Kingdom to describe a range of activity, from a walk in the park to trekking in the Alps. The word \\"hiking\\" is used in the UK, but less often than walking; the word rambling (akin to roam) is also used, and the main organisation that supports walking is called The Ramblers. Walking in mountainous areas in the UK is called hillwalking, or in Northern England, including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking, from the dialect word fell for high, uncultivated land. Mountain walking can sometimes involve scrambling.

History The idea of undertaking a walk through the countryside for pleasure developed in the 18th-century, and arose because of changing attitudes to the landscape and nature, associated with the Romantic movement.The Norton Anthology of English Literature, ed. M. H. Abrams, vol. 2 (7th edition) (2000), p. 9-10. In earlier times walking generally indicated poverty and was also associated with vagrancy.Rebecca Solnit, Wanderlust: A History of Walking. New York: Penguin Books, 2000, p.83, and note p.297. Thomas West, an English priest, popularised the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed > to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller > with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid > before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those > authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own > repeated observations. To this end he included various \\"stations\\" or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities. Published in 1778 the book was a major success. Claife Station, built at one of Thomas West's \\"viewing stations\\", to allow visiting tourists and artists to better appreciate the picturesque Lake District. Commemorative plaque of the Mass trespass of Kinder Scout in 1932; an event that led to great expansion of the public right of access to the British countryside. Another famous early exponent of walking for pleasure was the English poet William Wordsworth. In 1790 he embarked on an extended tour of France, Switzerland, and Germany, a journey subsequently recorded in his long autobiographical poem The Prelude (1850). His famous poem Tintern Abbey was inspired by a visit to the Wye Valley made during a walking tour of Wales in 1798 with his sister Dorothy Wordsworth. Wordsworth's friend Coleridge was another keen walker and in the autumn of 1799, he and Wordsworth undertook a three weeks tour of the Lake District. John Keats, who belonged to the next generation of Romantic poets began, in June 1818, a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the Lake District with his friend Charles Armitage Brown. More and more people undertook walking tours through the 19th-century, of which the most famous is probably Robert Louis Stevenson's journey through the C√©vennes in France with a donkey, recorded in his Travels with a Donkey (1879). Stevenson also published in 1876 his famous essay \\"Walking Tours\\". The subgenre of travel writing produced many classics in the subsequent 20th- century. An early American example of a book that describes an extended walking tour is naturalist John Muir's A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf (1916), a posthumous published account of a long botanising walk, undertaken in 1867. Due to industrialisation in England, people began to migrate to the cities where living standards were often cramped and unsanitary. They would escape the confines of the city by rambling about in the countryside. However, the land in England, particularly around the urban areas of Manchester and Sheffield, was privately owned and trespass was illegal. Rambling clubs soon sprang up in the north and began politically campaigning for the legal 'right to roam'. One of the first such clubs, was 'Sunday Tramps' founded by Sir Frederick Pollock, George Croom Robertson, and Leslie Stephen in 1879.\\"Sunday Tramps\\", National Portrait Gallery, London The first national grouping, the Federation of Rambling Clubs, was formed in London in 1905 and was heavily patronised by the peerage. Political activism and walking during interwar Britain During the 1930s, walking reached new levels of popularity as a pastime: on any weekend some ten thousand ramblers could be expected on the moors of the Peak District, while in the country at large there were over half a million ramblers.Alun Howkins and John Lowerson, Trends in Leisure 1919-1939: A Review for the Joint Panel on Leisure and Recreation Research (London: Sports Council and Social Science Research Council, 1979), 49. A convergence of economic factors played their part in this boom in numbers: the 1920s saw a steady reduction in the working hours of the British worker as well as a rise in real wages and a decreasing cost of travel.Frank Trentmann, ‚ÄúCivilization and Its Discontents: English Neo-Romanticism and the Transformation of Anti-Modernism in Twentieth-Century Western Culture,‚Äù Journal of Contemporary History 29:4 (1994), 583-625, 586 In the early 1930s, a rise in unemployment led to more leisure time, leading to a surge in walking known as a \\"hiking craze\\". Alun Howkins and John Lowerson, Trends in Leisure 1919-1939: A Review for the Joint Panel on Leisure and Recreation Research (London: Sports Council and Social Science Research Council, 1979), 48. There was also a high level of media coverage which, according to Ann Holt, was comparable to modern media hype. Ann Holt, ‚ÄúHikers and Ramblers: Surviving a Thirties Fashion‚Äù, The International Journal of the History of Sport 4 (1987): 56-67 Frank Trentmann has suggested that the surge in walkers made it \\"the numerically strongest part of the new romanticism in interwar Britain\\".Frank Trentmann, ‚ÄúCivilization and Its Discontents: English Neo-Romanticism and the Transformation of Anti-Modernism in Twentieth-Century Western Culture‚Äù, Journal of Contemporary History 29:4 (1994), 583-625, 585 With these increasing numbers came increasingly strong demands for walkers rights. Access to Mountains bills, that would have legislated the public's right to roam across some private land, were periodically presented to Parliament from 1884 to 1932 without success. Mass rallies and trespasses were held in support of this cause, including an annual access to mountains demonstration at Winnats Pass and, most famously, a mass trespass on Kinder Scout in Derbyshire. However, the Mountain Access Bill that was passed in 1939 was opposed by many walkers, including the organisation The Ramblers, who felt that it did not sufficiently protect their rights, and it was eventually repealed. The effort to improve access led after World War II to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, and in 1951 to the creation of the first national park in the UK, the Peak District National Park. The establishment of this and similar national parks helped to improve access for all outdoors enthusiasts. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 considerably extended the right to roam in England and Wales. Walking tour A walking tour is an extended walk in the countryside, undertaken by an individual or group and lasting several days. Walking tours have their origin in the Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.Rebecca Solnit, Wanderlust: A History of Walking. New York: Penguin Books, 2000, p.104. It has some similarities with backpacking, trekking, and also tramping in New Zealand, though it need not take place in remote places. In the late 20th century, with the proliferation of official and unofficial long-distance walking routes, some walkers now are more likely to follow a designated long-distance route than to plan their own route. Walking tours are also organised by commercial companies, and can have a professional guide, or are self-guided; in these commercially organised tours, luggage is often transported between accommodation stops.  Access to the countryside   England and Wales  =Rights of way = Limestone hills and dry-stone walls in the west of the Yorkshire Dales. This part of the national park is popular with walkers due to the presence of the Yorkshire three peaks. In England and Wales the public has a legally protected right to \\"pass and repass\\" (i.e. walk) on footpaths, bridleways and other routes which have the status of a public right of way. Footpaths typically pass over private land, but if they are public rights of way they are public highways with the same protection in law as other highways, such as trunk roads. Public rights of way originated in common law, but are now regulated by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. These rights have occasionally resulted in conflicts between walkers and landowners. The rights and obligations of farmers who cultivate crops in fields crossed by public footpaths are now specified in the law. Walkers can also use permissive paths, where the public does not have a legal right to walk, but where the landowner has granted permission for them to walk. =Rights of way in London= Definitive maps of public rights of way have been compiled for all of England and Wales as a result of Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, except the 12 Inner London boroughs which, along with the City of London, were not covered by the Act. To protect the existing rights of way in London the Ramblers launched their \\"Putting London on the Map\\" in 2010 with the aim of getting \\"the same legal protection for paths in the capital as already exists for footpaths elsewhere in England and Wales. Currently, legislation allows the Inner London boroughs to choose to produce definitive maps if they wish, but none do so\\". = Right to roam = Walkers long campaigned for the right to roam, or access privately owned uncultivated land. In 1932 the mass trespass of Kinder Scout had a far-reaching impact. The 1949 Countryside Act created the concept of designated open Country, where access agreements were negotiated with landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 gave walkers a conditional right to access most areas of uncultivated land.  Scotland  = Right to roam = In Scotland there is a traditional presumption of universal access to land. This was formally codified into Scots law under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, which grants everyone the right to be on most land and inland water for recreation, education, and going from place to place, providing they act responsibly. The basis of access rights in Scotland is one of shared responsibilities, in that those exercising such rights have to act responsibly, whilst landowners and managers have a reciprocal responsibility to respect the interests of those who exercise their rights. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides detailed guidance on these responsibilities. Responsible access can be enjoyed over the majority of land in Scotland, including all uncultivated land such as hills, mountains, moorland, woods and forests. Access rights also apply to fields in which crops have not been sown or in which there are farm animals grazing; where crops are growing or have been sown access rights are restricted to the margins of those fields. Access rights do not apply to land on which there is a building, plant or machinery. Where that building is a house or other dwelling (e.g. a static caravan) the land surrounding it is also excluded in order to provide reasonable measures of privacy. The issue of how much land surrounding a building is required to provide \\"reasonable measures of privacy\\" has been the main issue on which the courts have been asked to intervene. In Gloag v. Perth and Kinross Council the sheriff allowed about surrounding Kinfauns Castle, a property belonging to Ann Gloag, to be excluded from access rights. In Snowie v Stirling Council and the Ramblers‚Äô Association the courts allowed about to be excluded, but refused permission for a wider area to be excluded and required the landowner to keep the driveway unlocked to allow access. =Rights of way= In addition to the general right of access the public also have the right to use any defined route over which the public has been able to pass unhindered for at least 20 years. However, local authorities are not required to maintain and signpost public rights of way as they are in England and Wales. Northern Ireland The Mourne Wall, looking towards Hare's Gap in the Mourne Mountains, Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has very few public rights of way and access to land in Northern Ireland is more restricted than other parts of the UK, so that in many areas walkers can only enjoy the countryside because of the goodwill and tolerance of landowners. Permission has been obtained from all landowners across whose land the Waymarked Ways and Ulster Way traverse. Much of Northern Ireland's public land is accessible, e.g. Water Service and Forest Service land, as is land owned and managed by organisations such as the National Trust and the Woodland Trust. Northern Ireland shares the same legal system as England, including concepts about the ownership of land and public rights of way, but it has its own court structure, system of precedents and specific access legislation.A Guide to Public Rights of Way and Access to the Countryside: .  Long- distance footpaths Black Hill, Cheshire, England Long-distance paths are created by linking public footpaths, other rights of way, and sometimes permissive paths, to form a continuous walking route. They are usually waymarked and guidebooks are available for most long-distance paths. Paths are generally well signposted, although a map is also needed, and a compass may sometimes be needed on high moorland. There are usually places to camp on an extended trip, but accommodation of various kinds is available on many routes. However, occasionally paths are distant from settlements, so that camping is necessary. Water is not available on high downland paths, like The Ridgeway, though taps have been provided at some spots. Fifteen paths in England and Wales have the status of National Trails, which attract government financial support. Twenty-nine paths in Scotland have the similar status of Scotland's Great Trails. The first long-distance path was the Pennine Way, which was proposed by Tom Stephenson in 1935, and finally opened in 1965. Other paths include South Downs Way and Offa's Dyke Path. Major guides to these long- distance footpaths in Britain are provided by HMSO for the Countryside Commission, one of the first being that for the Pennine Way by Tom Stephenson in the 1960s. Hillwalking Walks or hikes undertaken in upland country, moorland, and mountains, especially when they include climbing a summit are sometimes described as hillwalking or fellwalking in the United Kingdom. Though hillwalking can entail scrambling to reach a mountain summit, it is not mountaineering. Fellwalking is a word used specifically to refer to hill or mountain walking in Northern England, including the Lake District, Lancashire, especially the Forest of Bowland, and the Yorkshire Dales, where fell is a dialect word for high, uncultivated land. Black Mountain, crossed by the Offa's Dyke Path on the English/Welsh border Popular locations for hillwalking include the Lake District, the Peak District, the Yorkshire Dales, Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and Black Mountains, Wales, Dartmoor and the Scottish Highlands. The mountains in Britain are modest in height, with Ben Nevis at the highest, but the unpredictably wide range of weather conditions, and often difficult terrain, can make walking in many areas challenging. Peak bagging provides a focus for the activities of many hillwalkers. The first of the many hill lists compiled for this purpose was the Munros ‚Äì mountains in Scotland over ‚Äì which remains one of the most popular. The United Kingdom offers a wide variety of ascents, from gentle rolling lowland hills to some very exposed routes in the moorlands and mountains. The term climbing is used for the activity of tackling the more technically difficult ways of getting up hills involving rock climbing while hillwalking refers to relatively easier routes. Liathach seen from Beinn Eighe. With the Munro \\"Top\\" of Stuc a' Choire Dhuibh Bhig (915 metres) in the foreground and the two Munro summits in the background. However, many hillwalkers become proficient in scrambling, an activity involving use of the hands for extra support on the crags. It is an ambiguous term that lies somewhere between walking and rock climbing, and many easy climbs are sometimes referred to as difficult scrambles. A distinction can be made by defining any ascent as a climb, when hands are used to hold body weight, rather than just for balance. While much of the enjoyment of scrambling depends on the freedom from technical apparatus, unroped scrambling in exposed situations is potentially one of the most dangerous of mountaineering activities, and most guidebooks advise carrying a rope, especially on harder scrambles, which may be used for security on exposed sections, to assist less confident members of the party, or to facilitate retreat in case of difficulty. Scramblers need to know their limits and to turn back before getting into difficulties. Many easy scrambles in good weather become serious climbs if the weather deteriorates. Black ice or verglas is a particular problem in cold weather, and mist or fog can disorientate scramblers very quickly. Striding Edge from Helvellyn, English Lake District Many of the world's mountaintops may be reached by walking or scrambling up their least steep side. In Great Britain ridge routes which involve some scrambling are especially popular, including Crib Goch on Snowdon, the north ridge of Tryfan, Striding Edge on Helvellyn and Sharp Edge on Blencathra in the Lake District, as well as numerous routes in Scotland such as the Aonach Eagach ridge in Glencoe. Many such routes include a \\"bad step\\" where the scrambling suddenly becomes much more serious. In Britain, the term \\"mountaineering\\" tends to be reserved for technical climbing on mountains, or for serious domestic hillwalking, especially in winter, with additional equipment such as ice axe and crampons, or for routes requiring rock-climbing skills and a rope, such as the traverse of the Cuillin ridge, on the Scottish island of Skye. The British Mountaineering Council provides more information on this topic. Navigation and map-reading are essential hillwalking skills on high ground and mountains, due to the variability of British and Irish weather and the risk of rain, low cloud, fog or the onset of darkness. In some areas it is common for there to be no waymarked path to follow. In most areas walking boots are essential along with weatherproof clothing, spare warm clothes, and in mountainous areas a bivvy bag or bothy bag in case an accident forces a prolonged, and possibly overnight halt. Other important items carried by hillwalkers are: food and water, an emergency whistle, torch/flashlight (and spare batteries), and first aid kit. And, where reception permits, a fully charged mobile phone is recommended. Hillwalkers are also advised to let someone know their route and estimated time of return or arrival. Guidebooks Hillwalkers on Catbells, Lake District, England W A Poucher (1891‚Äì1988) wrote several hillwalking guide books, in the 1960s, which describe, in detail, the various routes up specific mountains, along with the precautions needed and other practical information useful to walkers. The guides cover Wales, Peak District, Scotland, Isle of Skye and the Lake District. Even more detailed guides were written by Alfred Wainwright (1907‚Äì1991) but these are mainly restricted to the Lake District and environs. His main series of seven books was first published between 1955 and 1966. Both authors describe the major paths, their starting points and the peaks where they end, with important landmarks along each route. Neither are entirely comprehensive. More recently Mark Richards has written numerous walking guides, especially for the Lake District, for the publisher Cicerone, who are now the leading publisher of walking guides in the UK. The Scottish Mountaineering Club are, through the experience and knowledge of their members, the largest publishers of guidebooks to climbing and walking in Scotland. Walking in London The Regent's Canal near St Mark's Regents' Park. Walking is a popular recreational activity in London, despite traffic congestion. There are many areas that provide space for interesting walks, including commons, parks, canals, and disused railway tracks. This includes Wimbledon Common, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, Hampton Court Park, and Epping Forest. In recent years access to canals and rivers, including the Regents Canal, and the River Thames has been greatly improved, and as well a number of long-distance walking routes have been created that link green spaces. The following are some of long-distance routes in London: *Capital Ring a circular route with 15 sections and a radius of approximately 4‚Äì8 miles (6‚Äì13 km) from Charing Cross, mostly through the inner Outer London suburbs but also partly in Inner London. The route forms a complete circuit, crossing the River Thames twice and with a suggested starting point at Woolwich; *London Outer Orbital Path (\\"Loop\\") a 150-mile (240 km) circular route with 24 sections mostly through Outer London suburbs. The \\"M25\\" for walkers, the path is broken because the Thames cannot be crossed between Purfleet and Erith; *Jubilee Walkway a route through central London, originally called the Silver Jubilee Walkway, laid down in 1977 as part of the celebrations of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The route takes in many of London's major attractions; *Lea Valley Walk which starts outside Greater London but has around 12.5 miles (20 km) within its boundary. The route follows the River Lea and the Lee Navigation; *The River Thames Path a National Trail, opened in 1996, following the length of the River Thames, starting outside London at its source near Kemble in Gloucestershire and ending at the Thames Barrier at Charlton. It is about long. More than are within London.  Challenge walks  Challenge walks are strenuous walks by a defined route to be completed in a specified time. Many are organised as annual events, with hundreds of participants. In May and June, with longer daylight hours, challenge walks may be 40 or more miles. A few are overnight events, covering distances up to 100 miles. Well-known challenge walks include the Lyke Wake Walk and the Three Peaks Challenge in Yorkshire, and the Three Towers Hike in Berkshire. See also Long Distance Walkers Association. Ingleborough, Yorkshire, which is on the Yorkshire Three PeaksThere are also some challenge walks aimed at children, young adults and youth groups such as the Chase Walk.  Walking for health  In the UK the health benefits of walking are widely recognised. In 1995 Dr William Bird, a general practitioner, started the concept of \\"health walks\\" for his patients‚Äîregular, brisk walks undertaken to improve an individual's health. This led to the formation of the Walking for Health Initiative (WfH, formerly known as 'Walking the way to Health' or WHI) by Natural England and the British Heart Foundation. WfH trains volunteers to lead free health walks from community venues such as libraries and GP surgeries. The scheme has trained more than 35,000 volunteers and there are more than 500 Walking for Health schemes across the UK, with thousands of people walking every week. In 2008 the Ramblers launched its flagship Get Walking Keep Walking project, funded by the Big Lottery and Ramblers Holidays Charitable Trust.Get Walking Keep Walking website Unlike regular health walks, the Get Walking Keep Walking model uses targeted outreach programmes based around a 12-week walking plan to encourage regular independent walking. In the same year, a new organisation, Walk England was formed, with aid from the National Lottery and the Department for Transport, to provide support to health, transport and environmental professionals who are working to encourage walking.  Organisations  The government agency responsible for promoting access to the countryside in England is Natural England. In Wales the comparable body is the Countryside Council for Wales, and in Scotland Scottish Natural Heritage. The Ramblers (Britain's Walking Charity) promotes the interests of walkers in Great Britain and provides information for its members and others. Local Ramblers volunteers organise hundreds of group-led walks every week, all across Britain. These are primarily for members; non-members are welcomed as guests for two or three walks. The Get Walking Keep Walking project provides free led walks for residents in certain areas, information and resources to those new to walking. Among the organisations that promote the interest of walkers are: the Ramblers Association, the British Mountaineering Council, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, The Online Fellwalking Club, and the Long Distance Walkers Association, which assists users of long-distance trails and challenge walkers. Organisations which provide overnight accommodation for walkers include the Youth Hostels Association in England and Wales, the Scottish Youth Hostels Association, and the Mountain Bothies Association.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, though the Israeli government disputes this.The Geneva Convention BBC News. 10 December 2009  Land ownership  Havat Gilad, one of 90 settler outposts in the West Bank constructed without obtaining official authorisation from the Israeli government,'Israel searches West Bank after settler killed in drive-by shooting,' BBC News 10 January 2018. is located on land allegedly privately owned by Moshe Zar, a religious Zionist and long-time friend of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. He has claimed to have been buying land in the West Bank from individual Palestinians since 1979. A number of Palestinians have taken him to court asserting that he falsified contracts. After his son Gilad was killed, he vowed that he would establish six settlements in his son‚Ä≤s memory, one for each Hebrew letter of his name. Attempts to rebuild, involving expansion of construction, after the outpost had been demolished in February 2011, were challenged by villagers from the Palestinian township of Jit, who claimed that the residents of the outpost were building on privately-owned Palestinian land. The Israeli Civil Administration was reported to be examining the complaint, while stating that 'most lands in the area are private Palestinian lands.'Yair Altman, Settlers resume construction in Havat Gilad Ynet 8 March 2011  History  There have been a number violent incidents involving Havat Gilad settlers. On October 16, 2002, journalists covering a so-called ‚Äúquiet‚Äù evacuation at the outpost, were attacked by settlers, on October 19, 2002, a Shabbath, when the outpost was forcibly evacuated and all its buildings were razed by the Israel Defense Forces for the first time, about 1,000 settlers, trying to prevent the dismantling of the outpost, clashed with soldiers and police. During the two days of confrontations, 46 policemen, and dozens of male and female soldiers and settlers were lightly injured. Fifteen people were arrested, but were released a few days later. Some of the settlers were back at the outpost the next day and erected temporary structures which were dismantled a week later, but the settlers were back on the site after a few hours. In November, security forces decided to file charges against twelve of the protesters. In 2004, police arrested one settler, after armed settlers from the outpost had opened fire on shepherds from a nearby Palestinian village. In March 2009, five residents of the outpost were briefly arrested on suspicion of throwing stones at police, when security forces attempted to evacuate the site. In September of the same year, settlers and security forces clashed following an attempt by security forces to confiscate a truck which was supposedly used to illegally transport a mobile home to the site, leading to four arrests. In October 2010, Havat Gilad settlers set fire to olive trees belonging to Palestinian farmers of the village of Farata. On February 28, 2011, Civil Authority forces escorted by police officers arrived in the settlement to demolish several illegal structures. Violent clashes erupted when settlers threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas, stun grenades, and rubber bullets, injuring 15 settlers. Eight settlers were arrested, five for carrying concealing weapons, one for stone-throwing, and two for cutting down Palestinian olive trees. The demolition of the outpost led to further protests and violence among Israeli rightists, Seventeen pro-settlement protesters, seven of whom minors, were charged with disturbing the peace, attacking police, and damaging police vehicles. A week after the demolition, the destroyed structures were being rebuilt, and the settlers were said to plan to build several new homes, in addition to the ones that were demolished, as an act of protest. However, the government pledged to demolish the new buildings by the end of the year. On February 5, 2014, three residents of Havat Gilad Farm were arrested on suspicion of having touched two cars, and for spraying graffiti in the Palestinian village of Farata.Tovah Lazaroff,3 Residents of Gilad Farm outpost arrested and charged in price tag attacks,' Jerusalem Post, 5 February 2014.In December, 2 residents, Yehuda Landsberg and Yehuda Savir, were sentenced to 30 months imprisonment for the incident.Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man, 'Settlers sentenced to an unprecedented 30 months over 'price tag' attack,' +972 magazine, 21 December 2014.

Ha'aretz 31/1/2015 Until 4 February 2018, when it was granted legal status by the Israeli government, it had been considered an unauthorized outpost by the Israeli government and on a list of outposts that Israel promised the U.S. to dismantle. The outpost was dismantled several times, but settlers had returned and re-established it. On 4 February 2018, the Israeli Government authorized Havat Gilad as a result of which it would be connected to electricity and water, and would no longer be considered an outpost and would become a settlement within the Samaria Regional Council.http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/241525  January 2018 attack  On 9 January 2018, a volunteer medic resident and Rabbi of Havat Gilad, Raziel Shevach, was shot by an unidentified assailant while driving his vehicle near his home on Route 60 in the West Bank.

RARPA was developed as part of the Learning and Skills Council‚Äôs new measures of success. These new measures aim to harmonise the basis for measuring educational achievement, so that the performance of learners in different parts of the learning and skills sector can be more accurately compared.Measures of Success for the Learning and Skills sector: frequently asked questions (Learning and Skills Council, April 2007) p2  Process  RARPA is designed to support teaching and learning practices. It claims to help teachers to deliver personalised learning, with a view to ensuring that learning is taking place and that the learner is making progress. RARPA is intended to encourage learners to engage actively by measuring their own progress and achievements. RARPA is a tool that can serve as a measure of accountability. This means that the learning experience is subject to the formal inspection and quality assurance processes of the further education sector. The RARPA approach has five distinct staged processes: aims and objectives, initial assessment, learning objectives, identification of learning, and review and recording.  Aims and objectives  The ostensible aims of the course of learning should be communicated clearly to learners before they make a decision about their individual route to achievement.  Initial assessment  Learners‚Äô previous achievements, current skills and learning needs should be properly considered before a decision has been made about their particular route to achievement.  Learning objectives  A set of learning outcomes should be agreed with each learner that is consistent with their learning goal(s). These outcomes should be based on their identified needs and challenge them to make real progress in their learning achievement There should be opportunities, if necessary, to revise these learning outcomes during the course.  Identification of learning  The progress of learners should be recognised and recorded, through means of formative assessment by the teacher, and by learners themselves.Implementing measures of success, the handbook, section 10.1.3.2 (Learning and Skills Council)  Review and recording  Learners should be given regular opportunities to assess progress towards their learning outcomes and to review their planned route to achievement. Learners‚Äô success in reaching their planned goal(s) should be recognised through a process appropriate to their needs that summarises their achievements and identifies possible future goals.

Background  In September 1997 the Inter- Parliamentary Union (IPU) adopted a Universal Declaration on Democracy. That Declaration affirms the principles of democracy, the elements and exercise of democratic government, and the international scope of democracy. The international conferences on new and restored democracies (ICNRD process) began in 1988 under the initiative of President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines after the so-called peaceful \\"People Power Revolution\\" overthrew the 20-year dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Initially an inter-governmental forum, the ICNRD process developed into a tripartite structure with participation of governments, parliaments and civil society. The sixth conference (ICNRD-6) that took place in Doha, Qatar, in 2006 reinforced the tripartite nature of the process and concluded with a declaration and Plan of Action which reaffirmed the fundamental principles and values of democracy. Following up on the outcome of ICNRD-6, an advisory board set up by the chair of the process ‚Äì Qatar ‚Äì decided to promote an International Day of Democracy. Qatar took the lead in drafting the text of a United Nations General Assembly resolution and convened consultations with UN member states. At the suggestion of the IPU, on 15 September (date of the Universal Declaration on Democracy) was chosen as the day when the international community would celebrate each year the International Day of Democracy. The resolution entitled \\"Support by the United Nations system of efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies\\", United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/62/7 \\"Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies\\" was adopted by consensus on 8 November 2007.  Celebrations in 2008  The IPU has urged parliaments to celebrate the International Day of Democracy through some form of special activity, to be held on or as close to 15 September as possible depending on circumstances. The day will be an opportunity for parliaments to: * Emphasize the importance of democracy, what it involves, the challenges it faces as well as the opportunities it offers, and the central responsibility that all parliaments have as the key institution of democracy; * Examine and discuss how well parliament performs its democratic functions, possibly on the basis of a self-assessment, and identify what steps it may take to strengthen its effectiveness. To mark the first International Day of Democracy on 15 September 2008, the IPU will hold a special event at the House of Parliaments in Geneva. National parliaments are invited to organise their own democracy- related activities on that day to highlight the role of parliament as the cornerstone of democracy .  Celebrations in 2009   Celebrations in 2013  In 2013, IPU promoted the International Day of Democracy through its Member Parliaments in 162 countries around the world. As a result, a number of parliaments from all over the globe announced their events to be held on or close to 15 September. The year's theme was \\"Strengthening Voices for Democracy\\" and IPU launched an online contest to hear and gather stories from local democracy champions that managed to make their voices heard. These stories were to inspire people to take action in their own community.  Celebrations in 2014  The theme for the International Day of Democracy in 2014 is \\"Engaging youth on democracy\\". IPU has urged action and changes in mindset if disillusioned and alienated youth the world over are to be engaged in political decision-making. In its press release, IPU President Abdelwahad Radi said, \\"It is a clich√© to always link youth to the future. Young people not only have the power to define the future, but also decide on the present. However, they are largely absent from formal decision-making politics and this has to change\\". The IPU says youth participation has a special meaning for it and that a programme to promote young men and women‚Äôs involvement in the democratic process is getting underway, in follow-up to the resolution adopted by the IPU Assembly in 2010. The IPU announced it would organize the first Global Conference of Young Parliamentarians on 10 and 11 October 2014 and all parliaments were invited to attend. A photo contest titled \\"Engage for Change\\" encourages youth to show what action they take to bring about positive change in society by sending a photo that shows them working for positive change in their community, region, country or the world.  Celebrations in 2015  The theme for 2015 was: Space for Civil Society.  Celebrations in 2016  The theme for 2016 is Democracy and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.  Celebrations in 2017   Celebrations in 2018  The theme for this year‚Äôs observance is \\"Democracy under Strain: Solutions for a Changing World\\". Coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Day is also an opportunity to highlight the values of freedom and respect for human rights as essential elements of democracy.  Celebrations in 2019  The 2019 theme for democracy day was \\"participation\\". This year's International Day of Democracy is an opportunity to recall that democracy is about people. Democracy is built on inclusion, equal treatment and participation‚Äîand it is a fundamental building block for peace, sustainable development, and human rights.

Born in Virginia in 1795, Throckmorton was the son of a Revolutionary War soldier. He grew up in Virginia and met his first wife, Elizabeth Webb, there. After receiving a degree in Medicine in 1817, Throckmorton began what was to become a series of moves across the country. In 1821, he moved to Sparta, Tennessee where he practiced medicine. This was followed by a move to Illinois. In the mid-1830s, he moved his practice to Fayetteville, Arkansas. While living there, his wife Susan Jane [Rotan] died. He married his second wife, Malinda Clement, in 1840. (Malinda is sometimes referred to as Malinda Wilson as she married John H. Wilson after William Throckmorton died.) They moved to Texas a year later, settling near the town of Melissa in Collin County. He died on October 2, 1843 and was buried in the Throckmorton Cemetery outside Melissa. By his first wife, Throckmorton fathered eight children: William Albion (1819-1857); Mary Lee (1821-1822); John Augustus (1823-1895); James Webb (1825-1894); Robert Middleton (1828-1863); Lucy Jane (1831-1832); Dorothea Ann (1834-1834); Nancy Hampton (1836-1878).

Symptoms typically include anxiety, shakiness, sweating, vomiting, fast heart rate, and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures, seeing or hearing things that others do not, and delirium tremens (DTs). Symptoms typically begin around six hours following the last drink, are worst at 24 to 72 hours, and improve by seven days. Alcohol withdrawal may occur in those who are alcohol dependent. This may occur following a planned or unplanned decrease in alcohol intake. The underlying mechanism involves a decreased responsiveness of GABA receptors in the brain. The withdrawal process is typically followed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale (CIWA- Ar). The typical treatment of alcohol withdrawal is with benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam. Often the amounts given are based on a person's symptoms. Thiamine is recommended routinely. Electrolyte problems and low blood sugar should also be treated. Early treatment improves outcomes. In the Western world about 15% of people have problems with alcoholism at some point in time. About half of people with alcoholism will develop withdrawal symptoms upon reducing their use, with four percent developing severe symptoms. Among those with severe symptoms up to 15% die. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal have been described at least as early as 400 BC by Hippocrates. It is not believed to have become a widespread problem until the 1700s. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur primarily in the central nervous system. The severity of withdrawal can vary from mild symptoms such as sleep disturbances and anxiety to severe and life-threatening symptoms such as alcoholic hallucinosis, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability. Withdrawal usually begins 6 to 24 hours after the last drink. It can last for up to one week. To be classified as alcohol withdrawal syndrome, patients must exhibit at least two of the following symptoms: increased hand tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, transient hallucinations (auditory, visual or tactile), psychomotor agitation, anxiety, tonic‚Äìclonic seizures, and autonomic instability. The severity of symptoms is dictated by a number of factors, the most important of which are degree of alcohol intake, length of time the individual has been using alcohol, and previous history of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms are also grouped together and classified: *Alcohol hallucinosis: patients have transient visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations, but are otherwise clear. *Withdrawal seizures: seizures occur within 48 hours of alcohol cessations and occur either as a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure or as a brief episode of multiple seizures. *Delirium tremens: hyperadrenergic state, disorientation, tremors, diaphoresis, impaired attention/consciousness, and visual and auditory hallucinations. This usually occurs 24 to 72 hours after alcohol cessation. Delirium tremens is the most severe form of withdrawal and occurs in 5 to 20% of patients experiencing detoxification and 1/3 of patients experiencing withdrawal seizures. Progression Typically the severity of the symptoms experienced depends on the amount and duration of prior alcohol consumption as well as the number and severity of previous withdrawals. Even the most severe of these symptoms can occur as soon as 2 hours after cessation; this rapid onset alongside the syndrome's unpredictability necessitates either pre-planned hospitalization, treatment coordinated with a doctor, or at the very least rapid access to medical care; a supporting system of friends or family should also be introduced prior to addressing detoxification. In many cases, however, symptoms follow a reasonably predictable time frame as exampled below: Six to 12 hours after the ingestion of the last drink, withdrawal symptoms such as shaking, headache, sweating, anxiety, nausea, or vomiting occur. Other comparable symptoms may also occur in this period. Twelve to 24 hours after cessation, the condition may progress to such major symptoms as confusion, hallucinations (with awareness of reality), tremor, agitation, and similar ailments. At 24 to 48 hours following the last ethanol ingestion, the possibility of seizures should be anticipated. Meanwhile, none of the earlier withdrawal symptoms will have abated. Seizures carry the risk of death for the alcoholic. Although the patient's condition usually begins to improve after 48 hours, withdrawal symptoms sometimes continue to increase in severity and advance to delirium tremens, which is characterized by hallucinations that are indistinguishable from reality, severe confusion, seizures, high blood pressure, and fever that can persist anywhere from 4 to 12 days. Protracted withdrawal A protracted alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in many alcoholics when withdrawal symptoms continue beyond the acute withdrawal stage but usually at a subacute level of intensity and gradually decreasing with severity over time. This syndrome is sometimes referred to as the post-acute- withdrawal syndrome. Some withdrawal symptoms can linger for at least a year after discontinuation of alcohol. Symptoms can include a craving for alcohol, inability to feel pleasure from normally pleasurable things (known as anhedonia), clouding of sensorium, disorientation, nausea and vomiting or headache. Insomnia is a common protracted withdrawal symptom that persists after the acute withdrawal phase of alcohol. Insomnia has also been found to influence relapse rate. Studies have found that magnesium or trazodone can help treat the persisting withdrawal symptom of insomnia in recovering alcoholics. Insomnia can be difficult to treat in alcoholics because many of the traditional sleep aids (e.g., benzodiazepine receptor agonists and barbiturate receptor agonists) work via a GABAA receptor mechanism and are cross-tolerant with alcohol. However, trazodone is not cross-tolerant with alcohol. The acute phase of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome can occasionally be protracted. Protracted delirium tremens has been reported in the medical literature as a possible but unusual feature of alcohol withdrawal. Pathophysiology Chronic use of alcohol leads to changes in brain chemistry especially in the GABAergic system. Various adaptations occur such as changes in gene expression and down regulation of GABAA receptors. During acute alcohol withdrawal, changes also occur such as upregulation of alpha4 containing GABAA receptors and downregulation of alpha1 and alpha3 containing GABAA receptors. Neurochemical changes occurring during alcohol withdrawal can be minimized with drugs which are used for acute detoxification. With abstinence from alcohol and cross tolerant drugs these changes in neurochemistry gradually return towards normal. Adaptations to the NMDA system also occur as a result of repeated alcohol intoxication and are involved in the hyper-excitability of the central nervous system during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Homocysteine levels, which are elevated during chronic drinking, increase even further during the withdrawal state, and may result in excitotoxicity. Alterations in ECG (in particular an increase in QT interval) and EEG abnormalities (including abnormal quantified EEG) may occur during early withdrawal. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis and increased release of corticotropin-releasing hormone occur during both acute as well as protracted abstinence from alcohol and contribute to both acute and protracted withdrawal symptoms. Anhedonia/dysphoria symptoms, which can persist as part of a protracted withdrawal may be due to dopamine underactivity. Kindling Kindling is a phenomenon where repeated alcohol detoxifications leads to an increased severity of the withdrawal syndrome. For example, binge drinkers may initially experience no withdrawal symptoms, but with each period of alcohol use followed by cessation, their withdrawal symptoms intensify in severity and may eventually result in full-blown delirium tremens with convulsive seizures. Alcoholics who experience seizures during detoxification are more likely to have had previous episodes of alcohol detoxification than patients who did not have seizures during withdrawal. In addition, patients with previous withdrawal syndromes are more likely to have more medically complicated alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Kindling can cause complications and may increase the risk of relapse, alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive deficits. Chronic alcohol misuse and kindling via multiple alcohol withdrawals may lead to permanent alterations in the GABAA receptors. The mechanism behind kindling is sensitization of some neuronal systems and desensitization of other neuronal systems which leads to increasingly gross neurochemical imbalances. This in turn leads to more profound withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, convulsions and neurotoxicity. Binge drinking is associated with increased impulsivity, impairments in spatial working memory and impaired emotional learning. These adverse effects are believed to be due to the neurotoxic effects of repeated withdrawal from alcohol on aberrant neuronal plasticity and cortical damage. Repeated periods of acute intoxication followed by acute detoxification has profound effects on the brain and is associated with an increased risk of seizures as well as cognitive deficits. The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have been detoxified repeatedly but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior detox. Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears to be the most important factor in causing damage or impairment to brain function. The brain regions most sensitive to harm from binge drinking are the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. People in adolescence who experience repeated withdrawals from binge drinking show impairments of long-term nonverbal memory. Alcoholics who have had two or more alcohol withdrawals show more frontal lobe cognitive dysfunction than alcoholics who have experienced one or no prior withdrawals. Kindling of neurons is the proposed cause of withdrawal-related cognitive damage. Kindling from repeated withdrawals leads to accumulating neuroadaptational changes. Kindling may also be the reason for cognitive damage seen in binge drinkers. Diagnosis Many hospitals use the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) protocol in order to assess the level of withdrawal present and therefore the amount of medication needed. When overuse of alcohol is suspected but drinking history is unclear, testing for elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin or gammaglutamyl transferase can help make the diagnosis of alcohol overuse and dependence more clear. The CIWA has also been shortened (now called the CIWA-Ar), while retaining its validity and reliability, to help assess patients more efficiently due to the life-threatening nature of alcohol withdrawal. Other conditions that may present similarly include benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome (a condition also mainly caused by GABAA receptor adaptation). Treatment Benzodiazepines are effective for the management of symptoms as well as the prevention of seizures. Certain vitamins are also an important part of the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In those with severe symptoms inpatient care is often required. In those with lesser symptoms treatment at home may be possible with daily visits with a health care provider. Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medication for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and are generally safe and effective in suppressing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. This class of medication is generally effective in symptoms control, but need to be used carefully. Although benzodiazepines have a long history of successfully treating and preventing withdrawal, there is no consensus on the ideal one to use. The most commonly used agents are long-acting benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. These are believed to be superior to other benzodiazepines for treatment of delirium and allow for longer periods between doses. However, benzodiazepines with intermediate half- lives like lorazepam may be safer in people with liver problems. The primary debate between use of long-acting benzodiazepines and short-acting is that of ease of use. Longer-acting drugs, such as diazepam, can be administered less frequently. However, evidence does exist that \\"symptom-triggered regimens\\" such as those used when treating with lorazepam, are as safe and effective, but have decreased treatment duration and medication quantity used. Although benzodiazepines are very effective at treating alcohol withdrawal, they should be carefully used. Benzodiazepines should only be used for brief periods in alcoholics who are not already dependent on them, as they share cross tolerance with alcohol. There is a risk of replacing an alcohol addiction with benzodiazepine dependence or adding another addiction. Furthermore, disrupted GABA benzodiazepine receptor function is part of alcohol dependence and chronic benzodiazepines may prevent full recovery from alcohol induced mental effects. The combination of benzodiazepines and alcohol can amplify the adverse psychological effects of each other causing enhanced depressive effects on mood and increase suicidal actions and are generally contraindicated except for alcohol withdrawal. Vitamins Alcoholics are often deficient in various nutrients, which can cause severe complications during alcohol withdrawal, such as the development of Wernicke syndrome. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome, alcoholics should be administered a multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and folic acid. During alcohol withdrawal, the prophylactic administration of thiamine, folic acid, and pyridoxine intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate-containing fluids or food. These vitamins are often combined into a banana bag for intravenous administration. Anticonvulsants Very limited evidence indicates that topiramate or pregabalin may be useful in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Limited evidence supports the use of gabapentin or carbamazepine for the treatment of mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal as the sole treatment or as combination therapy with other medications; however, gabapentin does not appear to be effective for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal and is therefore not recommended for use in this setting. A 2010 Cochrane review similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not supported. Paraldehyde combined with chloral hydrate showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to life-threatening side effects and carbamazepine may have advantages for certain symptoms. Long term anticonvulsant medications are not usually recommended in those who have had prior seizures due to withdrawal. Prevention of further drinking There are three medications used to help prevent a return to drinking: naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram. They are used after withdrawal has occurred. Other Clonidine may be used in combination with benzodiazepines to help some of the symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of baclofen for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are sometimes used in addition to benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis. Antipsychotics may potentially worsen alcohol withdrawal as they lower the seizure threshold. Clozapine, olanzapine, or low-potency phenothiazines (such as chlorpromazine) are particularly risky; if used, extreme caution is required. While intravenous ethanol could theoretically be used, evidence to support this use, at least in those who are very sick, is insufficient. Prognosis Failure to manage the alcohol withdrawal syndrome appropriately can lead to permanent brain damage or death. It has been proposed that brain damage due to alcohol withdrawal may be prevented by the administration of NMDA antagonists, calcium antagonists, and glucocorticoid antagonists. Substances impairing recovery Continued use of benzodiazepines may impair recovery from psychomotor and cognitive impairments from alcohol. Cigarette smoking may slow down or interfere with recovery of brain pathways in recovering alcoholics.

A self-taught painter, he was a late adherent to the movement, not joining until 1929. He is noted for realistic paintings that combine \\"speed, aerial mechanisation and the mechanics of aerial warfare\\",Osborn though in a long career he painted in other styles as well. Early life Crali was born in the Bay of Kotor on the coast of Montenegro. His family lived in Zara until 1922, when they moved to Gorizia. At the age of fifteen, while a student at the local technical institute, Crali discovered Futurism. He took up painting, influenced by Giacomo Balla and Enrico Prampolini. Career Aeropittura In 1928 Crali flew for the first time. His enthusiasm for flying and his experience as a pilot influenced his art. In 1929, through Sofronio Pocarini, he made contact with Marinetti, the founder of Futurism, and joined the movement. In the same year aeropittura was launched in the manifesto, Perspectives of Flight, signed by Benedetta, Depero, Dottori, Fillia, Marinetti, Prampolini, Somenzi and Guglielmo Sansoni (Tato). The manifesto stated that \\"The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective\\" and that \\"Painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything.‚Äù Despite his relative youth, Crali played a significant part in aeropittura. His earliest aeropitture represent military planes, Aerial Squadron and Aerial Duel (both 1929). In the 1930s, his paintings became realistic, intending to communicate the experience of flight to the viewer. His best-known work, Nose Dive on the City (1939), shows an aerial dive from the pilot's point of view, the buildings below drawn in dizzying perspective. Crali exhibited in Trieste and Padua. In 1932 Marinetti invited him to exhibit in Paris in the first aeropittura exhibition there. He participated in the Rome Quadrennial in 1935, 1939 and 1943 and the Venice Biennale of 1940. At that time Crali was researching signs and scenery, leading in 1933 to his participation in the film exhibition Futuristi Scenotecnica in Rome. In 1936 he exhibited with Dottori and Prampolini in the International Exhibition of Sports Art at the Berlin Olympics. Crali‚Äôs declamatory abilities and his friendship with Marinetti led him to organise Futurist evenings at Gorizia, Udine and Trieste, where he read the manifesto Plastic Illusionism of War and Protecting the Earth which he had co-authored with Marinetti. He also published a Manifesto of Musical Words - Alphabet in Freedom. After the Second World War Crali lived in Turin after the war, where he continued to promote Futurist events. Despite the ending of the Futurist movement with the death of Marinetti in 1944 and its Fascist reputation, Crali remained attached to its ideals and aesthetic. Between 1950 and 1958 he lived in Paris, making occasional visits to Britain. He moved to Milan in 1958 where he remained (apart from a five-year period teaching at the Italian Academy of Fine Arts, Cairo) for the rest of his life. In Milan he began to collect and catalogue documents relating to his life and work. He donated his archive and several of his works to the Museo di arte moderna e contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto. \\"Sassintesi\\" and later life In 1959 he published the first post-war Futurist manifesto Sassintesi (‚ÄúStone Syntheses‚Äù). In it he advocated a new form of artistic expression using natural materials - pebbles, stones and rocks formed of various minerals. ‚ÄúThe inherent qualities of colour, form, translucence, texture, etc. were to suggest, develop and determine the idea of the artist, while their appearance and positioning produced a harmonious composition that relied much on the stones' natural symbiosis with the cosmos.‚Äù His sassintesi were exhibited in Milan in 1961. He tried to revive aeropittura in the late 1960s in a manifesto Orbital Art. His painting Frecce Tricolori (1966) depicts jet fighter planes. He continued to paint, sculpt, teach and lecture throughout the 'sixties, 'seventies and into the 'eighties. At his own wish, Crali was buried at Macerata, which remains the home of his family.

Photosensitive glass was first discovered by S. Donald Stookey in 1937.Paul, p. 333Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, pp. 194‚Äì209Maluf, pp. 62‚Äì63 History Photosensitive glass was invented in November 1937 by Dr. Donald Stookey of the Corning Glass Works. It was announced publicly ten years later on June 1, 1947. It was patented in 1950 by Stookey as U.S. Pat. No. 2,515,937 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,515,943 with gold microscopic particles and marketed under the trade name PhotoCor(R). Exposure process When the glass is exposed to UV light in the wavelength range 280‚Äì320 nm, a latent image is formed. The glass remains transparent at this stage, but its absorption in the uv range of the spectrum increases. This increased absorption is only detectable using uv transmission spectroscopy. The reason behind this is suggested to be an oxidation reduction reaction that occurs inside the glass during exposure in which cerium ions are oxidized to a more stable state and silver ions are reduced to silver. Post-exposure heat treatment When the glass is heated to temperatures in the range 550‚Äì560 ¬∞C for several hours the latent image is converted to a visible image through photoexcitation. Exposure through photographic negatives permits the development of three-dimensional color images and photographs. This heat treatment is done in two stages: the temperature is first raised to about 500 ¬∞C to allow for the completion of the oxidation-reduction reaction, and formation of silver nanoclusters. In the following stage, when the temperature is raised to 550‚Äì560 ¬∞C, a new material (lithium metasilicate) with the formula (Li2SiO3) forms on the silver nanoclustors, this material forms in the crystalline phase. HF chemical etching The lithium metasilicate that forms in the exposed regions of the glass has the unique property of being strongly etched in hydrofluoric acid (HF). Hence allowing a three-dimensional image of the mask to be produced, the resulting glass microstructures have a surface roughness in the range 5 Œºm to 0.7 Œºm.  X-ray sensitive glasses  As stated above radiation produces some direct and indirect measurable changes in the glasses. In some cases, the effect is readily observable immediately upon irradiation. In other cases, thermal treatment is required to bring about the observed changes. On the whole, the result of the mentioned reactions will be atomic silvers and/or silver clusters which act as nucleant for precipitation of lithium-meta- silicate during post heat-treatment of irradiated glass and Similar to other glass-ceramic systems, the more nucleation sites leads to more reduction of crystallization temperature and finer crystalline size. Therefore, to attain the above-mentioned condition, various energetic radiation such as UVand laser beam and x Œ≥ and proton and radiations have been used for different photosensitive glasses until now. Imanieh et al. investigated the effect of X-ray irradiation on solarization of photosensitive lithium silicate based glasses containing cerium, antimony, tin and silver elements. They have shown that there is a possibility to use X-ray in photosensitive glasses. This will open new doors for nano machining of glasses in near future. Applications Photosensitive glass Spinfex photosensitive glass Photosensitive glass is used in printing and reproducing processes. Photosensitive glass is like traditional camera film except that it reacts to ultraviolet (UV) light, where camera film responds to visible light.Parker, 2003 The ideal wavelength to use for exposure should be between 300 and 350 nm, with 320 nm being optimum. Photosensitive glass contains microscopic metallic particles. These microscopic metallic ion nanoparticles are made of gold or silver which is responsible for the refractive index change. Photosensitive glass is similar to photographic film. Photographic film uses chemicals, while photosensitive glass uses gold or silver ions in the material that will respond to the action of light. The process is to pass light of the ultraviolet wavelength through a negative on the glass. Photographic resolution can be obtained with adhesive polyester as a reverse negative, however anything which resists UV light can act as a \\"negative.\\" The glass is sensitive to light that when passes through a mask can ultimately turn it into a permanent picture with a heat process \\"fixing\\" permanently the image. Silver glass \\"latent images\\" will develop in 3‚Äì4 hours at 886‚Äì976 ¬∞F. Gold glass \\"latent images\\" require a higher temperature of 968‚Äì1058 ¬∞F and over a similar period of time for postbaking. Postbaking hastens the occurrence of the particles with the shadow areas of the negative, permitting deeper penetration into the glass than the highlighted areas. This gives the picture three dimensions and color. The photograph is developed by heating the photosensitive glass around 1000 ¬∞F for several hours after exposure. The glass itself is photosensitive and produces a three-dimensional image. Particles that are invisible to the naked eye (i.e. gold or silver) are in the glass. These microscopic particles move and grow when heated to form the photographic image itself. The process is similar to camera film, however a \\"negative\\" is placed on top of the photosensitive glass and then exposed to ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôultraviolet‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô light. Camera film, of course, would be exposed to ordinary visible light. Then there is a special process for the exposed photosensitive glass. The glass is reheated then in a kiln and postbaked for several hours. The image then \\"appears\\" within the special exposed glass as if by magic. The heated piece of photosensitive glass is then allowed to cool down and the process is done. The positive images produced within photosensitive glass comes in a variety of colors. As a material for the hot glass studio artist, an additional method of producing imagery in an object using photosensitive glass is to first blow an extremely thin rondel (cased or otherwise) which is annealed in the typical manner. That rondel is then cut into sections which are exposed under a negative. Next, those sections (containing the latent image) are warmed and applied to the surface of a gather of hot glass on the blowpipe. As the object is completed over several furnace reheats, the heat develops the image as the object is being created. This method specifically eliminates the need for the reheating of the object in a kiln for development, which consumes considerable oven time, energy, and the risk of loss or damage due to shattering on the way up to temperature, or more importantly, slumping while being held at temperature. The timing of the glassblower determines the final degree of development, and simple choices of form minimize distortion in the image. Since the image is inside and actually a part of the glass itself, photosensitive glass is the most durable photographic medium known. It is claimed that a photo image within photosensitive glass is the most durable form of photography and will last as long as the glass itself. The photographic image is not on the surface of the glass, but internally. Fluorescent photosensitive glass makes it possible to make fluorescent photographs and fluorescence holography. Photosensitive glass is different from photochromatic glass. Photochromatic glass is used in self-darkening sunglasses which darkens when exposed to bright daylight. It then returns to see-through transparency when strong daylight is removed and can then be used indoors as regular glasses. Little has been done to develop the product since its patent. It is labor-intensive and has a high cost. Only large commercial glass factories produce it. In the 1980s photosensitive glass was created to a small degree to be used in \\"hot glass\\" work. Then individual artists owned smaller studios and created works in blown glass and began experimenting with photosensitive glass. Going into the Twenty-First Century only a few glass artists know the technique of achieving good results with photosensitive glass. In the present time, the only photosensitive glasses produced are PhotoCor(R), Foturan and APEX. PhotoCor is produced by the inventor, Corning, Inc. Foturan is produced by SCHOTT Corporation and APEX by Life Bioscience. Photosensitive glass has been used as a holographic material to record diffractive optical elements for high power laser applications. Military applications One of the reasons for the delay between the invention of photosensitive glass and its public announcement approximately ten years later was its potential use in military applications. It is possible to burn images and words that are hidden in photosensitive glass until heated at a high temperature. The military used this fact during World War II to send secret messages to allied troops in pieces of what looked like \\"ordinary glass\\". At the other end, the person who received the \\"ordinary glass\\" just had to heat it up to read the hidden message. Because of this application photosensitive glass was kept secret until the end of World War II. Building applications The United Nations Building was faced with hundreds of square feet of photosensitive glass until its 2007 refurbishment when it was replaced with conventional glass with a printed pattern See also * Photochromic lens References Bibliography * Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, v.8 Macropaedia Ge-Hu, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1974, * Parker, Sybil P., Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms.

In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as vile and dirty pests. Their size, long antennae, shiny appearance and spiny legs make them disgusting to many humans, sometimes even to the point of phobic responses.David Berle (2007) Graded Exposure Therapy for Long-Standing Disgust-Related Cockroach Avoidance in an Older Male. Clinical Case Studies 6(4):339-347 C.M. Botella, M.C. Juan, R.M. Banos, M. Alcaniz, V. Guillen, B. Rey. (2005) Mixing Realities? An Application of Augmented Reality for the Treatment of Cockroach Phobia. CyberPsychology & Behavior. 8(2): 162-171. . This is borne out in many depictions of cockroaches, from political versions of the song \\"La Cucaracha\\" where political opponents are compared to cockroaches, through the 1982 movie Creepshow and TV shows such as The X-Files, to the Hutu extremists' reference to the Tutsi minority as cockroaches during the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and the controversial cartoons published in the \\"Iran weekly magazine\\" in 2006 which implied a comparison between Iranian Azeris and cockroaches. In Dutch Soccer the term \\"kakkerlakken\\" (Dutch for cockroaches) is used as a colloquial, often derogatory term for the supporters of Feyenoord. Not all depictions of cockroaches are purely negative, however. In the Pixar film WALL-E, a cockroach that has survived all humanity is the lead character's (a robot's) best friend, and waits patiently on him to return. The same cockroach survives getting squished twice. In the film Joe's Apartment, the cockroaches help the titular hero, and the narrator of the book Archy and Mehitabel is a sympathetic cockroach. In the book Revolt of the Cockroach People, an autobiographical novel by Oscar Zeta Acosta, cockroaches are used as a metaphor for oppressed and downtrodden minorities in US society in the 1960s and 1970s. The image of cockroaches as resilient also leads people to compare themselves to cockroaches. Madonna has famously quoted, \\"I am a survivor. I am like a cockroach, you just can't get rid of me.\\"\\"I am a survivor. I am like a cockroach, you just can't get rid of me.\\" - Madonna \\"Cockroach\\", or some variant of it is also used as a nickname, for example Boxing coach Freddie Roach, who was nicknamed La Cucaracha (The Cockroach) when he was still competing as a fighter. For on-screen moments, TV shows and movies often employ the Madagascar hissing cockroach due to its large size and very slow speed.

The character Dr. Berenbaum (based on the University of Illinois entomologist) suggests that it is actually swarms of cockroaches that are responsible for most UFO sightings because they can generate an electrostatic field which can be illuminated dependent on atmospheric conditions. In one of the scenes, a cockroach that escaped can be seen crawling over the camera, making it appear that the viewer's television has become infested. Though the shot was not planned, the producers decided to leave it in the episode. *ALF, Alf inadvertently releases a cockroach from his home planet in the house.

In written works *In Franz Kafka's story The Metamorphosis, the character Gregor Samsa awakes to find himself transformed into a giant \\"vermin.\\" Although the type of bug Gregor changes into is not specified, the physical description offered implies that it is a cockroach.

Since many manuscripts were made with fish-glue, starch-paste, leather and other edible substances, insect appetites were a constant problem to Arabic books and scrolls.Pollock, James W. \\"Kabi:Kaj to Book Pouches: Library Preservation Magic and Technique in Syria of the 1880s and the 1980s West.\\" Middle Eastern Library Association Notes (MELA Notes), Number 44, Spring, 1988, pages 8-10. A similar technique from Syria was to name the first and last page of a document or manuscript \\"The Page of the King of the Cockroaches\\", in the hope that the Cockroach King will control all other insects.

This could even cause an infinite loop in some cases where updates continually place the updated record ahead of the scan performing the update operation. The potential for this database error was first discovered by Don Chamberlin, Pat Selinger, and Morton Astrahan in 1976, on Halloween day while working on a query that was supposed to give a ten percent raise to every employee who earned less than $25,000. This query would run successfully, with no errors, but when finished all the employees in the database earned at least $25,000, because it kept giving them a raise until they reached that level. The expectation was that the query would iterate over each of the employee records with a salary less than $25,000 precisely once. In fact, because even updated records were visible to the query execution engine and so continued to match the query's criteria, salary records were matching multiple times and each time being given a 10% raise until they were all greater than $25,000. The name is not descriptive of the nature of the problem but rather was given due to the day it was discovered. As recounted by Don Chamberlin: > Pat and Morton discovered this problem on Halloween... I remember they came > into my office and said, ‚ÄòChamberlin, look at this. We have to make sure > that when the optimizer is making a plan for processing an update, it > doesn‚Äôt use an index that is based on the field that is being updated.

Jack) is the first solo album released by Serbian and former Yugoslav singer-songwriter ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá. The album was produced by Josip Boƒçek, who also played guitar on the album. The album featured the songs such as \\"Ratnik paorskog srca\\" which tells of a peasant who returns from World War I and who \\"wasn't made to be a soldier\\", \\"Za sve je kriv Toma Sojer\\" which tells of three boys which ran away from home influenced by The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, \\"Bo≈æa zvani Pub\\" which tells of a legendary gambler nicknamed Pub (Jack), romantic ballad \\"Lepa protina kƒái\\" (\\"Beautiful Priest's Daughter\\"), social poem \\"Za treƒáu smenu\\" (\\"For the Third Shift\\") and existential ballad \\"Na pola puta\\" (\\"Halfway Point\\"). All mentioned songs went on to become his and Bala≈°eviƒá's signature pieces, but among them (especially at the time) stood out song \\"Pesma o jednom petlu\\", which tells a story of an old man's younger days in the farm-rich area of Vojvodina when he had a pet rooster. The rooster is widely assumed to be a metaphor for his male sexual organ for which female birds tend to go crazy. The lyrics go on to list different kinds of female birds which in turn depict stereotypical characteristics of women in Serbian slang. The refrain line \\"Princip je isti, sve su ostalo nijanse\\" (\\"The principle is same, everything else are details\\") is referring to the way of courting the opposite sex. The lyrics conclude in the man's later years as he misses the good times gone by and giving advice never to make your rooster suffer, to let him fly around so that female birds can see him, for afterwards it will be too late, because even roosters age. Serbian rock critic Petar Peca Popoviƒá made the following comment in his D≈æuboks review of the album: :ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá was and still remains a masterful poet with a simply unbelievable gift for conjuring all the diversity of Vojvodina's clashes of culture, mentalities, customs and characters in a way that does not offend anybody, yet leaves nobody indifferent. The album was polled in 1998 as the 66th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav rock and pop albums in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music).

History Mitzpe Yair was established by Meir Am-Shalem in October 1998, and, according to Gideon Levy, was a price tag operation set up as Magen David Farm in retribution for the murder of a Susya settler, Yair Har-Sinai, after whom it was subsequently renamed.Gideon Levi, 'Not sacred, not stolen', at Haaretz, 7 September 2012 Legal status Mitzpe Yair is an unauthorized settlement that is regarded as illegal by the Israeli regional administration.Tovah Lazaroff, Yaakov Lappin, 'South Hebron Hills land dispute turns violent', Jerusalem Post 05/09/2008 'this had not stopped seven or eight families from placing caravans on the land to create the small Mitzpe Yair outpost . . Those caravans' placement has been deemed by the Civil Administration of Judea and Samaria to be illegal and there are enforcement proceedings under way against them.' In 2007 Peace Now revealed that a police superintendent was residing there despite its illegal status. The officer was ordered to evacuate his house by July that year.

Symptoms  A 16-year-old girl with a 2-month history of diarrhea, anorexia, bipedal edema and borborygmi found to have Capillaria infection in the Philippines Symptoms in infested humans include watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, edema, weight loss, borborygmus (stomach growling), and depressed levels of potassium and albumin in the blood. In humans, the parasites damage the cells of the intestinal wall. This damage interferes with the absorption of nutrients and the maintenance of a proper electrolyte balance. Untreated C. philippinensis infestations are often fatal.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis usually involves finding the eggs and/or adults of C. philippinensis in stool samples. Prevention Prevention is as simple as avoiding eating small, whole, uncooked fish. However, in C. philippinensis endemic areas, such dietary habits are common and have been practiced for many generations.  Treatment  Anthelmintics such as mebendazole and albendazole have been reported to eliminate infestation of humans more effectively than thiabendazole.Hwang, K.P., T.E. Wang, T.C. Liou, S.C.

Hutchins for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Converted for naval service at New York, she was placed in commission there on 11 May 1898, Lt. Henry Minett in command. Assigned to the North Atlantic Fleet as a dispatch ship, Viking remained at New York for the next two months. On 12 July, she departed New York bound for the blockading forces off the Cuban coast. After brief stops at Port Royal, South Carolina, and Key West, Florida, she joined the Fleet in Cuban waters on 28 July. After three weeks of duty carrying orders, messages, and passengers between ships on station on the blockade, Viking ended her brief war service without having participated in any combat. She headed back to Key West on 16 August, remained overnight, and then continued her voyage‚Äîvia Port Royal‚Äîto Hampton Roads, Virginia. She remained in the Hampton Roads-Norfolk area until 8 September when she headed up Chesapeake Bay to Annapolis, Maryland. After a two-day visit, she returned to Norfolk on the 11th. She was placed out of commission there on 22 September 1898. Viking remained at Norfolk until 29 September 1899 at which time she was reactivated for a bit more than three weeks of service which ended on 23 October.

The Tar Heels have played their games at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina since 1986. As of the 2009‚Äì10 season, North Carolina had the second most wins and the second highest winning percentage of any NCAA Division I men's team with a record of 2,004 wins and 720 losses over 100 seasons. The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 seasons from the 1970‚Äì71 season through 2000‚Äì01 season. The Tar Heels have won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament six times, have appeared in the tournament finals eleven times, a record 20 NCAA Final Fours, have made it into the NCAA tournament 47 times (tied for second-most all-time), and hold the record for all-time NCAA Tournament victories (102). Additionally, the team has been the number one seed in the NCAA Tournament 13 times, which is the most #1 seeds of all-time, and has been ranked in the top 25 AP Poll 703 times (1st all-time), has beaten #1 teams a record 12 times, has the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31, North Carolina has also won the National Invitation Tournament, appeared in two NIT Semifinals, and has made five appearances in the NIT Tournament. North Carolina has had a top twenty-five final ranking among Division I schools 42 times as ranked by the Associated Press and 44 times as ranked by the Coaches Poll. In five instances the Tar Heels have ended the season with a number one ranking in the Associated Press, and the Tar Heels have also been ranked number one five times at the end of the season by the Coaches' Poll. The Tar Heels played their first basketball game against Virginia Christian, on January 27, 1910, a 42‚Äì21 win for North Carolina.North Carolina Tar Heels Media Guide In 1921 North Carolina joined the Southern Conference.Southern Conference Fan Guide In the Southern Conference, the Tar Heels quickly found success. The 1923‚Äì24 Tar Heels squad went 26-0 and was retroactively awarded the national championship by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1936.The Helms Foundation named its own national college basketball champion for each year from 1936 through 1982. The foundation also retroactively awarded championships from 1901 through 1935. While the 1924 team was undefeated, they did not play a single opponent from north of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line; indeed, intersectional play would not start on a regular basis for another decade. However, the 1924 Tar Heels did beat the Kentucky Wildcats that season in a battle of what most considered the two best teams in the nation. Overall, the Tar Heels played 32 seasons in the Southern Conference from 1921 to 1953. During that period they won 304 games and lost 111 for a winning percentage of 73.3%. The Tar Heels were winners of the regular season for nine times and won the Southern Conference Championships 8 times. In 1953, North Carolina split off from the Southern Conference and became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.Official ACC Web Site Again, the Tar Heels quickly found success in their new conference. The Tar Heels won their first NCAA Championship under coach Frank McGuire in 1957, which was led by Lennie Rosenbluth and several other transplants from the New York City area. McGuire was forced to resign in 1961 after an NCAA violation regarding \\"improper recruiting entertainment\\" and was replaced by one of his assistants, Dean Smith. Smith coached the Tar Heels from 1961 to 1997 and brought an unprecedented level of success to the team. When Smith retired in 1997, he had the most wins ever of any NCAA Division I men's basketball coach with 879 wins, and the 9th highest winning percentage with 77.6% wins.This record for the most wins would later be surpassed by Bob Knight in 2007. During Smith's time as head coach, North Carolina won the ACC regular season championship 17 times, won the ACC tournament 13 times, won the NIT in 1971, went to the NCAA tournament 27 times, appeared in 11 final fours, and won two NCAA national tournament titles, in 1982 and 1993. The 1982 National Championship team was led by James Worthy, Sam Perkins, and a young Michael Jordan. The 1993 National Championship team starred Donald Williams, George Lynch and Eric Montross. While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the University‚Äôs first African American scholarship basketball player Charlie Scott. Smith retired in 1997 and the head coaching position went to his assistant Bill Guthridge. In his three seasons as head coach Guthridge led the Tar Heels to the NCAA Final Four twice, in the 1998 tournament and again in the 2000 tournament. Guthridge retired in 2000 and North Carolina turned to the 38-year-old Matt Doherty to lead the Tar Heels.ESPN article on Doherty's acceptance of head coach at North Carolina Doherty had mixed success while at Carolina. In his first season, the Heels shot to the #1 ranking in the polls in the middle of the Atlantic Coast Conference schedule and finished with an impressive 26-7 record. But Doherty's second season was the worst in recent history as the Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 8-20, missing postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965-66 season (including a record 26 straight NCAA Tournament appearances) and finishing with a losing record for the first time since 1962 (Dean Smith's first year as coach). They also finished 4-12 in the ACC--only the program's second losing ACC record ever. The 12 losses were six more than the Tar Heels had ever suffered in a single season of ACC play, and placed them in a tie for 7th place--the program's first finish below fourth place ever. The season also saw the end of UNC's run of 31 straight 20-win seasons and 35 straight seasons of finishing third or higher in the ACC. After bringing in one of the top 5 incoming classes for the 2002‚Äì03 season, the Tar Heels started the season by knocking off a top 5 Kansas team and going on to win the Preseason NIT and returning to the AP top 25. Carolina went on to finish the season with a 17-15 record, barely missing the NCAA tournament. Matt Doherty led the Tar Heels to the third round of the NIT where they ended their season with a loss to Georgetown. Despite the turnaround from the year before and the late season playoff run, at the end of the season Matt Doherty was replaced as head coach by Roy Williams. Roy Williams' first season was a moderate success with North Carolina finished 19-11 and the team was knocked out in the second round of the NCAA tournament by Texas. Williams was able to gain more success in his second season and coached North Carolina to a National Championship in 2005. After winning the championship, Williams had to deal with the departure of the team's top seven scorers. Most thought that 2005‚Äì06 would be a down season for Williams, but the Tar Heels proved to be surprisingly successful in part due to the help of the freshman Tyler Hansbrough. Williams was named Coach of the Year for his ability to turn around such a new team to such a high level of success. Since 2005 the Tar Heels have once again become a leader in the ACC, winning both the regular season and the conference tournament in 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, North Carolina was chosen as consensus pre-season #1 and managed to fulfill the predictions of a national championship by beating Michigan State in the 2009 National Championship. However, the 2009-10 season ended up being a down season for the Tar Heels. The loss of players such as Ty Lawson and Tyler Hansbrough, along with numerous injuries to key players, proved too much to overcome and resulted in the Tar Heels missing the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 2002-03 season. The Tar Heels returned to the NCAA tournament in the ensuring years losing to Kentucky and Kansas in the Elite 8 during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons respectively. In the 2015-16 season, Williams returned the Tar Heels to the NCAA Championship game where he sought his third National Championship against Villanova. Marcus Paige hit an off- balance three-point shot to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left. However, Villanova‚Äôs Kris Jenkins hit a buzzer-beating three pointer to defeat the Tar Heels 77-74. The Tar Heels returned to the 2017 National Championship game the following year where they defeated Gonzaga 77-65 to win their sixth NCAA title in program history.

missing since 1585) was an English printer, covertly producing Roman Catholic literature under Elizabeth I of England. He was imprisoned and tortured as manager of a secret press for the publication of devotional and controversial works. Life He was a member of an association of Roman Catholic unmarried gentlemen of property, organised by Father George Gilbert, SJ, and solemnly blessed by Pope Gregory XIII in 1580. The association's purpose was to raise funds for the support of priests, to convert Protestants, and, at a time when priests traveled in disguise, without papers of identification, to arrange for introductions which would guard both priests and laity against betrayal. The members undertook to content themselves with the bare necessaries of their state of life, to spend the remainder of their goods in the cause of the Church, and to devote themselves wholly to the salvation of souls and the conversion of heretics. At this time Father Robert Persons, SJ and Edmund Campion were preparing for a vigorous propaganda through the press. With the assistance of several of the old Marian priests, Persons procured from the elder Brooks, owner of a large house called Greenstreet, at East Ham, Essex, then five miles from London, permission for certain gentleman to lodge there. To this house, chiefly with the assistance of Brinkley, Persons conveyed a printing press and materials. Brinkley's seven workman appeared in public with fine clothes and horses, to avert suspicion. The parson and churchwardens urged the newly arrived gentlemen to attend services; an incautious purchase of paper almost gave a clue to the discovery of the press, and a servant of Brinkley's was caught and racked. Their first book, however, probably a work of devotion or of encouragement to Catholics, was successfully issued. Brinkley moved the press to the home of Francis Browne, brother of Viscount Montagu. Persons issued A brief Censure upon two Books written in answer to M. Edmund Campion's Offer of Disputation in 1581. Campion's challenge was then circulating in manuscript. Caution was required in the management of Brinkley's Press. Government experts, like Norton, reported that the Brinkley books, in spite of the Douai imprint, had been produced in England; the landlord Brooks was suspicious; information as to the press was inquired of Father Briant upon the rack. After a second removal, Brinkley printed, at a lodge belonging to Dame Cecilia Stonor's house, near Henley-on-Thames, Campion's \\"Decem Rationes\\". At Oxford, on Commemoration Day, 27 June 1581, the benches of St. Mary's Church were found strewn with copies of this ringing challenge to the universities. The capture of Campion near Oxford Sunday evening, 16 July, was followed in a few weeks by that of Brinkley and his printers. Brinkley, though tortured in the Tower of London, escaped the fate of his fellow prisoner, William Carter, a Catholic printer, who was executed at Tyburn. Brinkley was discharged in June 1583. He accompanied Father Persons first to Rome, where we find his name in the Pilgrim Book of the English College in the following September, and thence in the following year to Rouen. Here, with George Flinton, Brinkley printed a second edition of a work which Flinton had brought out in 1581, The Christian Directory. After Flinton's death about 1585, Brinkley continued to issue Catholic books. The date of his death is unknown. Joseph Gillow mentions a work translated from the Italian (Paris, 1579), entitled The Exercise of a Christian Life ... newly perused and corrected by the translatour (James Sancer). Sancer, or Sanker, is known to have been the pseudonym of Brinkley. This work, perhaps, is one of the early issues of Brinkley's own press.

His father's family is from Kars and his mothers family is from Sivas. He has an older and a younger brother and an older sister. Tigran was named after King Tigranes the Great, who ruled the Kingdom of Armenia at its greatest extent, and his father. Although Tigran‚Äôs father didn't make his sons follow in his footsteps, they received a love of the sport at an early age from him. Hayk, Tigran‚Äôs older brother, became a Master of Sports in weightlifting. But he had to quit it because of family problems when their father died at the age of 45. Tigran started to practice weightlifting at the age of 11. By 13, he had already won Armenia‚Äôs Weightlifting Championship. Career After the death of his father, Martirosyan began weight training under the guidance of Ashot Mkhitaryan. Tigran had a successful youth career, becoming a 2003 European Vice-Champion and a 2004 European Champion. In the same year, he won the gold medal of the 2004 European Championship among juniors. The following year, he won a gold medal at the 2005 European Championships among juniors again. Martirosyan also set two world records as a junior in the snatch and the total, both in the lightweight (69 kg) division, and still holds both of these records to this day. In 2006, Martirosyan began performing in adult level competitions. He competed at the 2006 World Weightlifting Championships and came in 6th place in the lightweight category with a total of 306 kg. Martirosyan won the silver medal at the 2007 European Weightlifting Championships in Strasbourg, with 331 kg in total. The next year, he won the gold medal at the 2008 European Weightlifting Championships in Lignano, with 346 kg in total. Martirosyan was initially awarded a bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics, lifting 153 in the snatch, 185 in the clean & jerk and 338 kg in the total. Martirosyan had tied in total with French weightlifter Vencelas Dabaya. Because Dabaya weighed a little less than Martirosyan, he was awarded the silver medal instead, despite Martirosyan having also lifted the second greatest total. At the age of 20 years and 64 days, Martirosyan was provisionally recognized as the youngest Olympic medalist from the independent Rupublic of Armenia. However, in 2016, he was stripped of his medal and disqualified from the Beijing 2008 Olympics following reanalysis of his samples from the 2008 Olympics, resulted in a positive test for the prohibited substances stanozolol and turinabol. In 2009, Tigran Martirosyan moved to a heavier weight class, from lightweight (69 kg) to middleweight (77 kg). Martirosyan debuted in the middleweight division at the 2009 World Weightlifting Championships in Goyang, where he took second place with a total of 370 kg, losing only to the Chinese weightlifter L√º Xiaojun, who set two of the three middleweight world records at the Championships. In a landslide victory, Martirosyan won a gold medal at the 2010 European Weightlifting Championships, becoming a two-time European Champion. Weeks later, Martirosyan's mentor suddenly Ashot Mkhitaryan died of a heart attack on May 23, 2010. Martirosyan competed at the 2010 World Weightlifting Championships in Antalya. Xiaojun had also returned and was considered a massive favorite to win the Championship once again. Martirosyan had scored the highest in the snatch and tied Xiaojun in the clean & jerk. As a result, Martirosyan defeated Xiaojun in a shocking upset and won the gold medal. Martirosyan lifted a total of 373 kg, just 5 kg short of the world record. Martirosyan made history as the first ever male weightlifter from the independent Republic of Armenia to become a World Champion in weightlifting.Prior to Tigran Martirosyan, the last Armenian athlete to become world champion in weightlifting was Israel Militosyan, who won the title in 1989, just two years before Armenia gained independence. In 2009, Nazik Avdalyan became a World Champion in women's weightlifting, making Tigran Martirosyan the first male and second weightlifter from independent Armenia to become a World Champion. Martirosyan dedicated his victory to the memory of his late coach Ashot Mkhitaryan. For his accomplishments that year, Martirosyan was voted the Armenian Athlete of the Year for 2010. Martirosyan could not repeat his success at the 2011 World Weightlifting Championships. He managed to win a bronze medal in the snatch, but came in fourth place in the total. Martirosyan announced before the tournament that he sustained an injured shoulder and, as a result, was unable to compete at full strength. He received treatment in Germany and recovered soon afterward. Martirosyan qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics and was Armenia's greatest gold medal hope. Unfortunately, he received a back injury just days before he was supposed to compete and was unable to participate. Martirosyan later revealed that this injury had been worsening over the past month. His injury was not as serious as his former one and he will be able to compete again the following year. He now has his sights set on the next Olympics. Personal life Martirosyan had the honor of lighting the fire at the Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium in Yerevan for the 5th Pan-Armenian Games on August 13, 2011.

Voluntary reception According to Max Rheinstein term \\"reception\\" should preferably be preserved to those situations in which legal phenomena of one legal climate are consciously and willingly adopted into another legal system. Legal necessity reception Where there is an apparent need for a change of legal system in one culture and another existing culture provides an opportunity to satisfy the need Legal veneration reception Veneration reception is one example which occurs if alien norms, institutes or a whole system is adopted for their venerated position and prestige of cultural background. Imposed legal reception If a legal phenomenon is imposed upon another nation by force, this is referred to as imposed legal reception, in few instances under certain conditions imposed reception may transform into a voluntary process and thus become genuine reception but usually imposed legal phenomenon would not be considered genuine legal reception. Legal transplantation Is a process whereby a legal phenomenon transfers to another geographic area or culture together with people. A situation where a norm of another legal culture is established in a different legal climate by enacting legislation regardless of its original implementation background may also be interpreted as a mere transplantation of a legal phenomenon. Transplantation also occurs where a legal theory is taken to another geographical area. As in the case of imposed reception or voluntary reception, an original transplantation may become true reception: of course not among the group or nation which is the carrier of transplantation but among the legal culture surrounding it in the new area. The transformation of transplantation into reception is perhaps of greater significance in the history of legal science than it is in positive law. Methodological and systematic reception in which the spread of legal doctrines and theories plays an especially important role. It is quite clear that the spread of methods brings about the spread of their conceptual and systematic basis. In this regard, system not only refers to a certain classification of legal material, but an internally consistent and systematic approach to law. 'Doctrine of reception' in common law In common law, the doctrine of reception (properly, reception of the common law of England in a colony) refers to the process in which the English law becomes applicable to a British Crown Colony, protectorate, or protected state. In Commentaries on the Laws of England (Bk I, ch.4, pp 106‚Äì108), Sir William Blackstone described the doctrine as follows: > Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the > lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them desert and > uncultivated, and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when > already cultivated, they have been either gained by conquest, or ceded to us > by treaties. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at > least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two > species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For > it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted > by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the > birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force... But in > conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the king > may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change > them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the > law of God, as in the case of an infidel country. (Note: the 'infidel country' reference here was mainly intended to prohibit customs considered barbaric by the British, such as cannibalism, once a territory was colonized, in an age when communications between the British government and her far-flung colonies could take months on end.) In other words, if an 'uninhabited' territory is colonised by Britain, then the English law automatically applies in this territory from the moment of colonisation; however if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively a form of indirect rule) until formally superseded by the English law, through Royal Prerogative subjected to the Westminster Parliament. Hong Kong In practice, it could take years or even decades for the native law in a colony to be gradually superseded by the English law. The legal history of Hong Kong provides an illustration of this point: after the colonization by the British Empire in 1841, the Great Qing Legal Code remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the end of the 19th Century, Chinese offenders were still executed by decapitation, whereas the British would be put to death by hanging. Even deep into the 20th Century and well after the fall of the Qing dynasty in China, Chinese men in Hong Kong could still practice polygamy by virtue of the Qing Code‚Äîa situation that was ended only with the passing of the Marriage Act of 1971.

As Haridwar has traditionally been a site, for death rites and also Shraaddha, amongst Hindus, it soon also became customary for the family pandits to record each visit of the family, along with their gotra, family tree, marriages and members present etc., grouped according to family and home town.

History Tracing of genealogy records  By Hindus and people of Indian origin  This custom not well known today to Indians settled abroad, in an ancient custom detailed family genealogies of Hindu families for the past several generations are kept by professional Hindu Brahmin Pandits, popularly known as Pandas, at the Hindu holy city of Haridwar in hand written registers passed down to them over generations by their Pandit ancestors which are classified according to original districts and villages of ones ancestors, with special designated Pandit families being in charge of designated district registers, even for cases where ancestral districts and villages that have been left behind in Pakistan after Partition of India with Hindus having to migrate to India. Of Hindu ancestors of Muslims, Christians and Sikhs In several cases present day descendants are now Sikhs, Muslims and Christians. It is not uncommon for one to find details of up to or even more than one's past seven generations in these genealogy registers kept by the Pandas of Haridwar. Cremation rituals and genealogy record keeping  For centuries when Hindu ancestors visited the holy town of Haridwar for any purpose which may have mostly been for pilgrimage purposes or/and for cremation of their dead or for immersion of ashes and bones of their kin after cremation into the waters of the holy river Ganges as required by Hindu religious custom, it has been an ancient custom to go to the Pandit who is in charge of ones family register and update the family's genealogical family tree with details of all marriages, births and deaths from ones extended joint family. Genealogy record keeping at Haridwar  Haridwar, a site for Hindu pilgrimage, 1866 photograph. In present day India people visiting Haridwar are dumbfounded when Pundits out of the blue solicit them to come and update their very own ancestral genealogical family tree, news travels like wildfire among the Pandits (colloquially called the Panda) with ones family's designated Pandit being quickly notified of ones visit. Nowadays with Hindu joint family system having broken down with people preferring more nuclear families, record keeping Pandits prefer visitors to Haridwar to come prepared after getting in touch with all of ones extended family and bringing all relevant details regarding ones ancestral district and village, names of grand parents and great grand parents and marriages, births and deaths that have occurred in the extended family, even with as much details as possible of the families married into. A visiting family member is required to personally sign the family genealogical register furnished by ones Family Panda after updating it for future family visitors and generations to see and to authenticate the updated entries, friends and other family members accompanying on the visit may also be requested to sign as witnesses.

In World War II, he is alleged to have participated in transferring 900 handicapped Catholic children into a camp where they were killed.  Biography  Sewering was born on 30 January 1916, 17 years to the day before Adolf Hitler came to power. Sewering joined the SS on 1 November 1933 for \\"social reasons\\", claiming that young men were \\"simply the victims of propaganda.\\" A year later, he joined the Nazi Party. In the summer of 1942, he worked as assistant physician at the Sch√∂nbrunn Sanitarium, near Dachau in Bavaria. According to two nuns who broke their silence in 1993, he killed 900 physically and mentally handicapped children by transferring them from Sch√∂nbrunn to the Eglfing-Haar \\"healing center\\", a facility south of Munich. One of these children he was accused of killing, the 14-year-old Babette Fr√∂wis whom he consigned to Eglfing-Harr as epileptic, was never examined by him. She later became a postergirl for the practice of Nazi euthanasia. Sewering denied these allegations. However, he was barred from entering the United States on these grounds and Jewish organizations called for him to be tried for murder. After World War II, he became a respected physician, and earned the praise of noted doctor Wolfgang Wesiack. Sewering, who became the head of the German Medical Association in 1993 lived in Dachau in his latter years. A San Francisco Bay Area physician who lost 26 relatives in the Holocaust, Dr. Michael Franzblau, spent years attempting to have Sewering indicted for war crimes.http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/14797/marin-nazi- hunter-vows-fight-to-end-to-indict-doctor/ In May 2008, the German Federation of Internal Medicine awarded Sewering the Gunther-Budelmann medal for services to the nation‚Äôs health system\\", its highest honor.

The company specialized in bringing to market drugs that had been discovered but unmarketed by other companies including Cardizem which treats arrhythmias and high blood pressure, Carafate (an ulcer treatment), Gaviscon (an antacid), Seldane (a withdrawn antihistamine), Nicorette (anti-smoking gum) and Cepacol mouthwash.Marion Merrell Dow, Inc., International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 9. St. James Press, 1994 (reprinted on fundinguniverse.com) The company operating out of its headquarters at 9300 Ward Parkway was a springboard for its founder Ewing Marion Kauffman to start the Kansas City Royals baseball team. History Marion's office space in Kansas City was taken over in 2006 by Cerner Corporation Richardson-Merrell The company traces its roots back to 1828 when William S. Merrell opened the Western Market Drug Store at Sixth Street and Western Row (now Central Avenue) in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Merrell expanded into the wholesale drug business. Following his death in 1880 his sons formed the William S. Merrell Chemical Company.This Day in Ohio History by Rebecca Goodman and Barrett J. Brunsman - Emmis Books - 2004 In the 1930s, it merged with a company started by Lunsford Richardson to become Richardson-Merrell. Richardson's most notable product was Vicks VapoRub (named in honor of his brother-in-law Dr. Joshua Vick, a Selma, North Carolina physician. In 1958, Richardson-Merrell acquired the English company Milton Antiseptic Ltd.Michigan Business Reports, Issue 57: p. 161 A team at William S. Merrell Chemical Company led by Frank Palopoli synthesized clomifene in 1956 (to stimulate ovulation); after its biological activity was confirmed a patent was filed and issued in November 1959.Allen, R.E., Palopoli, F.P., Schumann, E.L. and Van Campen, M.G. Jr. (1959) U.S. Patent No. 2,914,563, Nov. 24, 1959. Scientists at Merrell had previously synthesized chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. =Thalidomide= One of Richardson- Merrell's best-known incidents revolved around its efforts to introduce thalidomide into the US market in the 1950s and 1960s under the brand name \\"Kevadon\\". The drug was already highly popular in Europe as a sedative and antiemetic for elderly patients. Although neither tested nor approved for use during pregnancy, its effectiveness and absence of significant side-effects led many physicians to prescribe it to pregnant women. Richardson-Merrell submitted their new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June, 1960. During the application process, Richardson- Merrell asked the FDA for quick approval of the drug, and distributed 2.5 million tablets of thalidomide to 1,200 American doctors with the understanding that the drug was under investigation, a preemptive marketing strategy that was permissible at the time under existing regulations. Nearly 20,000 patients received the drug. Reviewing pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey, who had joined the FDA just a month before the application's arrival, repeatedly denied the company's requests for permission to market the drug, citing an insufficient number of controlled studies to establish risks. When studies revealed that 10,000 children worldwide had been born with severe birth defects from the drug, Merrell withdrew its application and recalled the remaining unconsumed tablets from doctors offices around the country. Ultimately, 17 children in the United States were born with defects. For correctly denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson- Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President John F. Kennedy.Thalidomide - medic8.com - Retrieved August 25, 2008 Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Dow Chemical acquired controlling interest of the Merrell pharmaceutical division of Richardson-Merrell company in 1980 and it became Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals. The former Richardson-Merrell became Richardson- Vicks, Inc.. In 1985, Richardson-Vicks was acquired by Procter & Gamble. =U.S. Supreme Court Cases= In the U.S., Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals was a named party in at least two major United States Supreme Court cases: * Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804 (1986), involving original jurisdiction * Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals 509 U.S. 579 (1993), applied the rules governing expert testimony established by the Federal Rules of Evidence to the admission of scientific evidence at trials conducted in federal courts Marion Merrell Dow In 1989 Dow Chemical acquired 67 percent interest of Marion Laboratories, which was renamed Marion Merrell Dow. Among the products Merrell Dow brought that would be shortly marketed were Seldane, Lorelco, Nicorette and Cepacol. The merger was considered a good fit because of Marion Laboratories strong sales force and Merrell Dow's strong research and development capabilities. At the time Marion Laboratories was outperforming all other drug company stocks by 2¬Ω times. Marion had the highest sales and the highest profit per employee of any company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Dow's initial offer was $38 a share in cash, or $2.2 billion, for the 39 percent of Marion's 150 million shares with an option to raise the stake to 67 percent by 1992. The offer made 300 of Marion's employees millionaires. The deal created the fifth largest drug company in the United States in terms of sales. Although controlled by Dow the new company continued to trade on Marion Laboratories' old New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol \\"MKC.\\" =Marion Laboratories= Ewing Kauffman, a former pharmaceutical salesman in Kansas City, Missouri started the company in 1950 in the basement of his Kansas City home by selling calcium supplements made from crushed oyster shells which he made in his home and starting with $5,000 in capital. Kauffman would say later he used his middle name for the company to avoid the impression that it was a one-person operation. The company quickly took off. As Kauffman expanded he offered his employees share options and profit sharing. Rather than researching products, the company adopted a policy of buying products discovered by other companies and reformulating them for market. In 1964 it formally incorporated as Marion Laboratories, Inc. In the 1980s it marketed Silvadene (a burn cream), Ditropan (treatment for bladder spasms), Nitro-Bid (chest pain treatment), ARD and Bac- T-Screen (helped identify bacteria), Culturette (used to identify Group A streptococci) and ToxiLab, a drug detection system used to detect drug abuse.

Germany has an embassy in Zagreb and an honorary consulate in Split. , there were 360‚Äì400,000 people of Croatian origin resident in Germany. According to the 2011 Croatian census there is 2,902 Germans in Croatia.http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/htm/usp_03_HR.htm First Croat elected to Bundestag is Josip Juratoviƒá (SPD) (2004‚Äìpresent). Croats and other South Slavic peoples have been greatly influenced by German language and culture for centuries. During the Cold War, socialist Yugoslavia, of which Croatia was a member republic, enjoyed good relations with both West and East Germany. Hundreds of thousands of Croatian people migrated to West Germany as Gastarbeiter, and German tourists began visiting Croatia's Adriatic coast in large numbers. Germany has to date had close co-operations with Croatia. When Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991, many German politicians and other leaders declared support, with then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher being one of the strongest advocates of international recognition of the newly independent Croatia. History Croatian Embassy in Berlin Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2011 Honor guard in front of Banski dvori, welcoming Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader One of the first contacts between Croats and Germans (Francia) was mentioned by Gottschalk of Orbais in the description of Croatia King Trpimir I in the 9th century. At that time, there have been acts of war between the Franks and Croats. For example, in year 838 Bavarian Duke and later King Louis sent troops against the Croatian Duke Ratimir who successfully resisted the attack. In recent times Croats connected with the German speaking countries through the Croatian union with Austria (1527‚Äì1918). In the 17th and 18th centuries planned settlement of German-speaking population of Danube Swabians onto the Croatian soil was conducted because some of those Croatian parts of the Austrian empire had lost a lot of population due to Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars. Most of these immigrants settled in the Croatian villages in Eastern Slavonia, especially in Osijek, and Western Syrmia.Gabriella Schubert: Das deutsche Theater in Esseg. Aufgerufen am 31. Dezember 2011 In the First World War Croats fought on the side of the Central Powers, alongside Germany, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. With the collapse of the dual monarchy in 1918, the Croats as well as Croatian Germans first entered the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and in 1919 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Germans tried to organize a German party (Partei der Deutschen) so they could be directly represented in the National Assembly but Government prohibited that. In 1941 Hitler attacked and occupied Yugoslavia. He created a Nazi- puppet state Independent State of Croatia (NDH) on part of Yugoslavian territory. Many German soldiers from Wehrmacht had been deployed all across the NDH. During 1942 and 1943 even more soldiers arrived from Germany because of an increase number of attacks on the Nazis by the Yugoslav partisans who were led by Josip Broz Tito. At the end of the war large number of Danube Germans withdrew together with the German army. Those who remained were subjected to repression by the Yugoslav authorities which have won the war. The same persecution of Germans was implemented all across Europe by the Allies. These reprisals were caused by the statement that all Germans collectively collaborated with the German-Nazi occupiers which was not true. In 1955, SFR Yugoslavia and West Germany severed diplomatic relations after the Hallstein Doctrine was accepted by Yugoslavia by which it recognized East Germany. In 1968 diplomatic relations were again established. At that year West Germany and Yugoslavia signed an agreement on labour force which allowed a large number of Croats to go to work in Germany as guest workers. Also, a large number of German tourists began coming on holiday to the Croatian coast. This tradition is maintained to this day. Germany played an important role in 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence in the fight for recognition of newly formed Republic of Croatia in order to stop ongoing violence in Serb- inhabited areas. Helmut Kohl requested immediate recognition of Croatia in the Bundestag on 4 September 1991. Germany was criticized, mostly by United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands, that its rapid recognition of Croatia would aggravate finding peace settlement. These remarks were opposed by German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher who claimed that the recognition was arranged with the EU partners. Regardless remarks given by these three countries all of them agreed to pursue a common approach and avoid unilateral actions. On 10 October 1991, two days after the Croatian Parliament confirmed the declaration of independence, the EEC decided to postpone any decision to recognize Croatia for two months. German foreign minister Hans Dietrich Genscher later wrote that the EEC decided to recognize Croatian independence in two months if the war had not ended by then. With the war still ongoing when the deadline expired, Germany presented its decision to recognize Croatia as its \\"policy and duty\\". German position was fully supported by Italy and Denmark, while France and the UK attempted to prevent German recognition by drafting a United Nations resolution requesting that no country take unilateral actions which might cause the situation in Yugoslavia to get worse. Ultimately, France and the UK backed down during the Security Council debate on the matter on 14 December, when Germany appeared determined to defy the UN resolution. On 17 December 1991 the EEC formally agreed to grant Croatia diplomatic recognition on 15 January 1992 on the basis of its request and a positive opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Commission. Iceland and Germany recognized Croatia on 19 December 1991. They were the first western European countries to do so.\\"Date of Recognition and Establishment of Diplomatic Relation\\".

Biography He was born in 1811 in Philadelphia to Episcopalian minister, the Rev. William Bryant. His mother, was a daughter of John Delavau, a shipbuilder of Philadelphia. His early education was under his father and in the Episcopalian Academy. He received the degree of A.B. in 1839, and A.M. in 1842 from the University of Pennsylvania, and entered the General Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church in New York in 1839. After one year he left the seminary to travel in Europe. On his return he was received into the Catholic Church at St. John's Church, Philadelphia on February 12, 1842. He graduated in medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1848. In 1855, during the yellow fever epidemic in Portsmouth and Norfolk, Virginia, he volunteered for duty and returned only after the epidemic had subsided. In 1857, he married Miss Mary Harriet Riston, daughter of George Riston. For two years in the early sixties he was editor of the Catholic Herald. Works His principal work, published in 1859 by subscription, is an epic poem entitled The Redemption, apparently inspired by a visit to Jerusalem. It is founded on the Bible and Catholic tradition. He also published, about 1852, a controversial novel entitled Pauline Seward which had considerable vogue at the time, especially among Catholics, and ran through ten editions. In 1855 he published The Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, an exposition of the dogma recently promulgated.

The elephants were driven into the stockade by skilled mahouts mounted on domesticated elephants. This method was practiced widely in North- east India, particularly in the state of Assam, mostly in South India, and in particular in the erstwhile Mysore State (now part of Karnataka) state. The khedda practice and other methods of trapping or capturing elephants have been discontinued since 1973 following the enactment of a law under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, declaring the Indian elephant to be a highly endangered species. In the case of elephants which cause extensive damage by encroaching into human habitations and damaging crops, the forest department has the authority to capture them. Etymology Khedda is a word in the Hindi language meaning a \\"ditch\\", which was used as a trap to capture many wild elephants. Prior to introduction of this system the method used to trap wild elephants was a pit system. History Elephant stockade or Kheddah An early description of a khedda was written by the Greek explorer and ambassador to India, Megasthenes (ca. 350 ‚Äì 290 BC), on which Strabo based his account in Geographica. The description was similar to the modern technique. Female elephants were used as bait. When the captured elephants were worn out by famine and combat with tame elephants, their legs were tied. Finally their necks were lacerated, and leather straps inserted in the cuts \\"so that they submit to their bonds through pain, and so remain quiet.\\" Man-elephant conflict is a major factor in either capturing them or hunting them for economic purpose. Four methods of trapping them have been practiced. These methods are: by trapping them in pits; by kheddah operations for capturing a herd of elephants, by driving into kheddas or enclosures, or driving the herd through the river-drive method; by noosing them with the help of mahouts sitting on the backs of trained elephants, mostly adopted to capture single elephants; and using decoy or lure by tamed female elephants and then spearing them. In Mysore George P. Sanderson with the Maharaja of Mysore and Prince Albert Victor watching the khedda operation In Mysore, the khedda system was first introduced by G P. Sanderson in 1873‚Äì1874 at Kardihalli. The venue of such events was the Kakanakote forest on the banks of the Kabini River. This was organized by the forest department at frequent intervals, usually coinciding with the visit of a dignitary to the state. Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, had failed to capture elephants. Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali were not successful in trapping wild elephants in spite of using their army. The first attempt to capture the elephants by Colonel Pearson, a British Army Officer, had also failed. However, G.P. Sanderson, who worked for the government of Mysore in the forest department, in his book titled Thirteen Years Among The Wild Beasts of India has noted: \\"Hyder made a trial, a century before, in the Kakanakote Jungles, but had failed and had recorded his opinion that no one would ever succeed, and his curse upon any one that attempted to do so, on a stone still standing near the scene of his endeavors.‚Äù The term ‚Äúgame‚Äù is used to denote wildlife hunting as an official royal sport, which was practiced by the erstwhile Maharajas of princely states of India like Mysore in which British officers also took keen interest. Such games were specifically arranged as an entertainment to visiting Dukes and Viceroys. One such khedda operation was arranged by Sanderson by the river- drive method through the Kabini River in honour of the Grand Duke of Russia when he visited Mysore, in 1891. Following the successful operation of the first khedda by Sanderson, this system, started in Kakanakote became very popular in Mysore. Over the next century 36 khedda operations were held till 1971 when it was legally banned under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 as it was considered a crude and gruesome method perpetrated on animals. In Assam In Assam which is reported to have the largest population of elephants in the country, the practice followed to catch elephants was by the khedda system, also known as Mela Shikar kheddas are further classified as the Pung Garh and the Dandi Garh. In Bengal also the practice followed was khedda and this operation was performed by the Government of Bengal to capture elephants for its use. In other states In the Madras State, now Tamil Nadu, and in Kerala, the practice followed to capture a small number of elephants was by the pit method during the monsoon months of July to September. The elephants were captured and tamed to meet the demands of temples and to move timber in the forests. Noosing, using the trained elephants backs, is the practice adopted in Bengal and also in Nepal. In this method three or four fast moving tamed elephants, each with three mahouts as guides were used in this method with the rope tied to the tame elephants body with the other end used as a noose. Khedda system The composition of the team for the khedda system to trap elephants comprised drum beaters, mahouts, security men, assistants and trained elephants known as kumkis. After locating a herd of wild elephants to be captured it was encircled by the team of the hunters sealing all routes of escape. A fenced circuit of area was created and cordoned around the herd; this was stocked with adequate supply of feeds and water and well camouflaged. A trained elephant To prevent elephants from going astray, big fires were lit, shouting done, drums beaten and gun shots fired to scare the elephants and keep them confined. Following this activity of keeping the elephants within the confined space, building of the enclosure was carried out. This enclosure, located in a camouflaged area along one of the main paths of the elephant, was built to dimensions of about diameter raised to a height of . The enclosure was fortified with slanting buttresses and ties. A highly secure entrance gate fitted with spikes was built. The entrance path to guide the elephants was done through two palisades. The herd of wild elephants, scared by din and sound and fire, were forced to go through the \\"funnel- shaped\\" route into the enclosure and then the gates were shut. Following the capture in the trap, elephants were denied food, forced to starve and were even injured, which made them weak. Thus confined into the khedda the wild elephants were then approached by the mahouts with the trained elephants to pacify them. Then the mahout with the assistance of a helper prodded the wild elephant with an iron rod to lift its one leg so that it could be noosed with ropes. Using the same procedure, the other three legs and the neck of the elephant were noosed, and wild elephants subject to the discomfort and being immobilized would become easier to control. Once tamed they were trained.

Croatia has an embassy in Ljubljana and two honorary consulates in Maribor and Koper. Slovenia has an embassy in Zagreb and an honorary consulate in Split. The countries share of common border. Relations between Slovenia and Croatia are generally considered to be friendly, but plagued with a series of unresolved border disputes and other vestiges from the time when both countries were the northernmost part of SFR Yugoslavia. History Before 1991, both countries were part of Yugoslavia. On June 26, 1991, a mutual recognition agreement was signed by both countries. Diplomatic relations between both countries were established on February 6, 1992. In a series of high-level meetings since the latter half of 1998, Slovenia and Croatia have been engaged in settling bilateral differences, a process which accelerated after the death of Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman in 1999. Since May 2004, Slovenia has been a member of the European Union, whereas Croatia was still negotiating for the admission. This strengthened Slovenian negotiation position in the disputes between the two states. Slovenia has supported the accession of Croatia to the European Union, but has demanded that the opened bilateral questions be resolved before Croatia's accession to the Union. The problem escalated in 2008 with Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession that lasted into 2009 before the two countries agreed to an EU-sponsored arbitration. On 3 March 2013, Croatia and Slovenia reach an agreement on Ljubljana Bank. A month after that, the Parliament of Slovenia unanimously ratified the Croatian accession treaty. Issues of contention Border disputes The border disputes between the two states concern: * the division of former Yugoslav territorial waters, particularly in the Gulf of Piran; * the hamlets of Bu≈æini, Mlini, ≈†kodelini and ≈†krile located to the south of river Dragonja in Istria, which were administered by Croatia from 1954, after the river was re-routed, and which Slovenia claims as part of cadaster municipality Seƒçovlje; * the Sveta Gera (Trdina Peak) in the ≈Ωumberak Mountains, with the Slovenian Army occupying barracks that according to the Croatian side lay partially in Croatian territory; * the changing meanders of the river Mura, near Hotiza and Sveti Martin na Muri, where the situation in nature differs from the descriptions in official maps and documents. Slovenia claims that the maritime border in Piran Bay does not go through the middle of the bay, while Croatia claims it does. This is causing problems for fishermen due to there being an undefined area where the naval police of each country may patrol. Related to the border in Piran Bay is Slovenian access to international waters in the form of a corridor which would require Croatia to cede its exclusive rights over at least some of its territorial waters to the west of Umag. The disputed Dragonja area is located near the Seƒçovlje- Plovanija official border crossing point, set up by an interim agreement of the two countries in the 1990s. A referendum regarding the ratification of the agreement on the arbitration between Slovenia and Croatia regarding the Gulf of Piran border dispute was held in Slovenia in June 2010. Croatia and Slovenia agreed to let outside arbitrators come up with a plan to divide the Gulf in 2009 in the hopes of finding a resolution to the dispute and easing Croatia's entry to the Union. Though the parliaments in both Croatia and Slovenia ratified the agreement, the Slovene parliament additionally voted to require a public referendum on the deal. The agreement was supported by 51.54% of voters and opposed by 48.46% of voters. In October 2010, the Slovenian law on the ratification of the agreement was also unanimously recognized by the Slovenian Constitutional Court as being in accordance with the Constitution of Slovenia. The diplomatic notes about the agreement were exchanged between the Government of Slovenia and Government of Croatia on November 25, 2010. The agreement came into force on November 29, 2010. Croatian exclusive economic zone in the Adriatic Sea A disputed issue with Croatia was Slovenian and Italian opposition to the proclamation of the Croatian Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone (Exclusive Economic Zone) in the Adriatic Sea. Slovenia is disputing this, requiring direct access to the international waters. This policy has been in place since late 2004 but excludes the EU countries (namely, Slovenia and Italy). In the negotiations with the European Union, it was decided that Croatia can proclaim an ecological protection zone for third countries, but not also for the countries of the European Union. About 40% of all the catchment of Slovenian fishermen originates from the zone. Ljubljana Bank Another open issue is the financial compensation for the Croatian depositors who lost their savings in the liquidation of the Slovenian-based Yugoslav bank Ljubljana Bank. During SFRY, the said bank had a branch in Zagreb. In December 1991, Croatian authorities allowed the transfer of two thirds of the foreign-currency debt of the Zagreb branch of Ljubljana Bank to a number of Croatian banks. However, some 132,000 clients kept their savings in Ljubljana bank. By 1994, the Slovenian Parliament formed Nova Ljubljanska Banka with the old bank's assets but none of its debts. In 1995, the Croatian bank Privredna banka Zagreb filed a lawsuit against Ljubljana Bank, after the Croatian Ministry of Finance authorized it to do so. In 1997 the Slovenian parliament halted all lawsuits against Ljubljana Bank by foreign citizens. In 2001, the Ministry of Finance extended the lawsuit authorization to Zagrebaƒçka banka. The two countries signed the 2001 Agreement on Succession Issues, dealing with the succession negotiations after the break-up of Yugoslavia. In 2002, succession negotiations were hosted by the Bank of International Settlements in Basel, but Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina rejected the proposed model in which they would have to reimburse the depositors. The negotiations stalled after that. In 2010, after the Kosor‚ÄìPahor agreement, the Croatian side had reportedly agreed to the Slovenian position, which was a precondition for Croatia to close the negotiations with the EU regarding Chapter 4 of the Acquis on the free movement of capital.http://euobserver.com/news/31295 The Slovenian position has been that the compensation is a succession issue. Slovenia also made it their condition for the acceptance of Croatia to the European Union, most recently in July and September 2012. In April 2012 Croatia passed a conclusion according to which this is only a dispute between the bank and its Croatian savers and should be resolved in courts. The European Commission considers this to be a bilateral issue. On 6 November 2012, the European Court of Human Rights delivered a first-degree verdict in the case of Ali≈°iƒá and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and the ‚ÄúFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia‚Äù, finding Slovenia in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordering it to compensate \\"the applicants and all others in their position\\" (individual Ljubljana Bank savers). In Croatia, some interpreted this as a precedent for the diplomatic issue, but Slovenian Foreign Minister Erjavec released a statement saying this is a separate issue from the diplomatic issue, rather that the latter was about \\"transferred debt\\".http://www.mzz.gov.si/nc/en/newsroom/news/article//31359/ On February 7, 2013, Croatian and Slovenian Foreign Ministers said they had solved the problem of the former Ljubljana Bank, which was threatening to impede Croatia's EU accession in July.

The symbols are predominantly depicted in red, black and yellow, traditional colours of the Minangkabau people who are the original settlers in the present-day state (see: the Marawa Minangkabau). Also recognised in the symbols are the political history of Negeri Sembilan, its ruler, and the state's past relationship with the British Empire.  Flag  23px The flag of Negeri Sembilan The flag of Negeri Sembilan consists of a yellow flag with a canton on the upper hoist, which is divided diagonally from the corner of the upper hoist towards the corner of the lower fly. The upper portion of the canton is coloured red, while the lower portion is coloured black, exactly like the flag of Papua New Guinea. The symbolisation of the flag is primarily concentrated towards the association of its colours with the people of the state. The yellow represents the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan, the red denotes the citizens of the state, and the black symbolises the four undangs (traditional chiefs). As well as being the state flag of Negeri Sembilan, the flag is also in use by the Yang di-Pertuan Besar as the royal standard to date. Prior to 1942, the British Resident of Negeri Sembilan was also assigned the same flag, with the exception it is forked at the fly. The Marawa Minangkabau, in which the Negri flag's colours are based on. Customary flags Certain districts (luak) in Negeri Sembilan have their own flag for ceremonial uses during Adat Perpatih events. They are hardly seen in daily government administrative functions.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms of Negeri Sembilan. The Negeri Sembilan coat of arms and state emblem is based on Western heraldry, but consists of only two heraldic elements: The shield (escutcheon) and crest or helm; the motto of the Negeri Sembilan arms, normally included on the bottom as a scroll on the majority of Malaysia's coats of arms, is embedded into the shield of the arms. Like the flag, the Negeri Sembilan coat of arms utilises the colours black, red and yellow with the minor addition of white. ;Escutcheon :The escutcheon of the arms is depicted as an Old French shield outlined in black and white. The shield itself is coloured in shades of the Minangkabau people's traditional colours, like the flag, but is illustrated in the form of three partitions separated by diagonal lines running from the upper left to the lower right and varies slightly by its symbolisation. The colours signify the following: :* the yellow as the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan; :* the black as the four Undangs (with the addition of the Tunku Besar of Tampin); and :* the red as past relations with the British. :Further adorning the shield are nine yellow stalks of rice attached to the motto in the form a white scroll with \\"Negeri Sembilan\\" written in Jawi scripture (ŸÜ⁄¨ÿ±Ÿä ÿ≥ŸÖÿ®ŸäŸÑŸÜ), with a nine-pointed star below. The stalks signifies the nine states under the old Negeri Sembilan: Jelai (Inas), Jelebu, Johol, Kelang, Nanaing, Rembau, Segamat and Pasir Besar, Sungei Ujong, and Ulu Pahan. Similarly, the nine-pointed star symbolise the nine (original) states of Negeri Sembilan united as one. ;Crest or helm :The shield is topped by a crest or helm in the form of a white staff known as the Changgai Putri (or Changgai Puteri), which is fronted by a red sword and red scabbard. The staff represents the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar, while the sword and scabbard signify justice. Additionally, the staff and sword represent the Yang di-Pertuan Besar's personal Sceptre of Regalia since 1948.

The station formerly carried most of its programming from ABC Radio's \\"Young AC\\" Network, until the station went to a more local presentation in 2010. KNCK-FM is owned and operated by Barbara White, through licensee White Communications, LLC. General Broadcasting Co. Inc. transferred the license for this radio station to KNCK Inc. on November 1, 1989. The license was subsequently assigned to White Communications, LLC. History Original license KNCK-FM was the first licensed FM broadcast station in North Central Kansas. It was originally licensed in 1979 as KCKS-FM to General Broadcasting Company, owned (mostly) by William F. Danenbarger, a former reporter and bureau manager for United Press International (UPI). The station license permitted broadcast at an Effective Radiated Power of 3,000 watts on 95.3 MHz (channel 237A). The original antenna was situated atop the sister station's approximately 200-foot tower in the station's back yard. In 2010, the station changed call signs to KNCK, matching its AM sister station, and meaning \\"North Central Kansas\\", its primary service area. Tower loss In 1980, a tornado destroyed the tower used by KNCK-AM and KCKS-FM. The station's General Manager and Chief Engineer, Wendell Wilson, was able to put the AM station back on the air using a low- power transmitter and modified antenna mounted to the side of the studio building but the FM station was off the air until construction of the new tower was complete. The original tower was painted red and white and had aviation warning lights but recent erection of a nearby (and much taller) tower for the local cable system removed this requirement for the KNCK/KCKS tower. For this reason, the new tower remained steel grey. New ownership North Central Kansas native Joe Jindra started working at KNCK while still in high school and spent his life working in radio across the country in Kansas, Missouri, and Arizona. He returned to Concordia in 1989 and purchased the stations from General Broadcasting Company. Under Jindra's ownership, the station increased its power, initially to 6,000 watts, and ultimately to 100,000 watts. Increase of power to 100,000 watts required the station to purchase a new transmitter, change frequency from 95.3 MHz, a \\"class A\\" channel (limited to 6,000 watts), to 94.9 MHz, a \\"class C1\\" channel, and move to a new tower, 528 feet tall. Jindra sold KNCK-FM, sister station KNCK, and translator K252EY to Barbara White's White Communications, LLC effective September 7, 2017, at a purchase price of $600,000. Format KCKS began its broadcasting years as an automated EZ-listening station, using a format provided by the Century 21 music service of Dallas, Texas (now part of the Jones Radio Networks. In 1985, the station switched to a modified version of Century 21's Adult Contemporary (AC) format, with a heavy emphasis on prior AC hits. In 1987, the station subscribed to a Chicago-based satellite service, Satellite Music Network, providing a Hot AC format called \\"Starstation\\" with live air talent, which it continued to use through 2010 (Satellite Music Network was sold to ABC Radio and later to Citadel Broadcasting/Cumulus Media and the format was renamed Hits & Favorites. For many years, the station joined in simulcast (simultaneous broadcast) with its AM sister station during the morning hours, the noon news (15 minutes) and the evening news (15 minutes). During the school year, it also hosted a daily one-hour program, \\"the CHS Goodtime Hour\\", operated out of a small studio at the local high school as part of a class in broadcasting and journalism.

Largely focused on direct mail, Littleton publishes catalogs several times yearly and has a \\"coins-on-approval\\" program. Company history Biographical background As is the case with many numismatic firms, the history of the Littleton Coin Company is part and parcel of the biography of an individual. Company founder F. Maynard Sundman was born October 17, 1915, in New Britain, Connecticut, the only child of a couple living on a 3.5 acre farm located just northeast of that town.Michael O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness: The Life Achievement of Maynard Sundman at Littleton Stamp and Coin Company. Littleton, NH: Littleton Coin Press. 1995; pg. 15. Sundman's paternal grandfather and grandmother had emigrated to the United States from Sweden and Norway, respectively.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pp. 15-16. His grandfather worked as a foreman in a lock factory, his grandmother a committed gardener and homemaker.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 16. Both were deeply important to Maynard Sundman during his formative years.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 17. About 1927 or 1928, when Maynard was a boy of 12, he was captivated by the postage stamp collection of a young friend. Sundman began to build a collection of his own, purchasing stamps by mail order from the Herbert A. Kegwin Company of Middletown, New York, one of about 50 American philatelic retailers of the day.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pp. 17-18. His collecting interest spread and Sundman was soon subscribing to Mekeel's Weekly Stamp News, a publication which gradually taught him the mechanics of mail order \\"approval sales,\\" in which customers were periodically provided with numerous groups of stamps for sale.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 18. The recipient would then select the lots desired, returning the bulk of the consignment with payment. This would prove to be the business model use by Sundman and his Littleton Coin Company in later years. In 1929 Sundman's interest in retail selling was further piqued by his first exposure to H.E. Harris & Co., the wildly successful philatelic mail order operation run by Henry Ellis Harris ‚Äî who had himself begun in the stamp business as a boy of 14.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 19. Sundman began to dream of following in Harris's footsteps as a successful entrepreneur dealing in the collector market.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 20. Sundman graduated from Bristol High School in 1935 and set about entering the mail order stamp trade.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 24. Having accumulated a nest egg of $400 ‚Äî a considerable sum during the Great Depression ‚Äî Sundman wrote directly to H.E. Harris to obtain a wholesale catalog.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 25. Additional dealer inventory was purchased from Held Brothers in New York City.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 27. An initial advertisement was placed in the August 17, 1935 issue of Stamps Magazine, with Sundman doing business in his own name as the \\"Maynard Sundman Stamp Company\\" rather than as less descript corporate entity.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pp. 28-29. Sundman's initial efforts at approval selling proved successful and in July 1936 he was advanced a $50 line of credit by H.E. Harris & Co., the beginning of a close business relationship which would run into the millions of dollars over the next four decades.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 31. Backed by Harris's expanding credit line for provision of wholesale stamps, Sundman's business grew dramatically. By June 1939 the 23-year-old entrepreneur presided over a company with 4 employees, who dealt with 500 new prospective customers per week.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 44. The firm built its growing customer list through a steady stream of advertisements placed in the popular press, including such magazines as Boys' Life, Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, and in the back of comic books.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 46. In April 1941 the young stamp mogul married the former Felicia Dorothy Kasper, known to her friends as \\"Fannie.\\"O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 57. The couple would remain together for over half a century, raising children who would later work in the family business. The coming of World War II interrupted Sundman's best- laid plans, and he was drafted into the American military during the summer of 1941, ordered to report for training early in September of that year.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pp. 57-58. A difficult decision was made and the stamp-selling enterprise was shut down for the duration of the war.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 58. The lucrative customer list was transferred in exchange for a 10% commission paid to Sundman on sales made to people on the list. These funds allowed the debt to H.E. Harris & Co. to be largely or completely liquidated. Establishment Sundman was honorably discharged from the military in October 1945, having served as a military policeman in Northern Africa and Italy.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 93. He returned to New England intent upon resuming business as a stamp dealer. Together with his wife Fannie the Sundmans obtained a lease of a building in the small town of Littleton, New Hampshire, to headquarter a new venture, to be known as the Littleton Stamp Company.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 108. H.E. Harris would again prove instrumental in Sundman's success, this time allowing his 30-year-old prot√©g√© and business associate carte blanch access to his company's wholesale inventory, with an initial dealer inventory advanced to Sundman valued just in excess of $25,000.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 110. Littleton was chosen in part due to its post office, which was large and efficient for a town of Littleton's size.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 113. This aspect of infrastructure was rightfully considered by the Sundmans to be of pivotal importance for their future mail order operation. Several decades later, between catalogs, approvals, and correspondence Sundman's Littleton Stamp and Coin Company would generate upwards of 2 million pieces of mail per year.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 114. Business commenced in December 1945, with the first advertising placed in four mainstream popular magazines.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pp 117-118. H.E. Harris himself wrote the advertising copy for the first Littleton Stamp Company ad, which promised \\"Double your money back if not delighted!\\" to purchasers of a packet of airmail stamps costing 10 cents.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 118. Sales the first month amounted to less than $800 ‚Äî a total which nearly tripled by the third month of business as the mailing list grew and repeat business began to flow in.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 120. As the Littleton Stamp Company grew, so too did the Sundman family through the birth of three sons: David Sundman (born 1948), Frederick \\"Rick\\" Sundman (born 1950), and Donald \\"Don\\" Sundman (born 1954).O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 123. All three sons would eventually work in managerial capacities in the burgeoning family business, with David and Rick concentrating on numismatics and Don eventually heading philatelic operations after the 1974 acquisition of the Mystic Stamp Company. Littleton's growth was bolstered by the close personal friendship and business relationship between Sundman and H.E. Harris, with Harris maintaining confidence and trust even as the credit balance on wholesale inventory topped the $200,000 mark in the early 1950s.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 129. The company's mailing list and sales volume continued to expand, however, until ultimately the Harris line of credit was paid down in full. As was the case with other prominent stamp dealers of the day, during the first postwar years when Littleton Stamp was beginning to be established business was dominated by sales to boys and girls ‚Äî the so-called \\"juvenile trade.\\"O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 147. In later years, with the growth of television, the ready availability of transportation, and the expansion of team sports, demographics of the trade shifted somewhat as children were presented with additional recreational opportunities. Sundman and Littleton moved from a concentration upon advertising in magazines targeted to a young male readership to ads in the Sunday supplements inserted into mass circulation newspapers, with one particularly successful campaign which offered 10 free Bohemia-Moravia stamps depicting Adolf Hitler ultimately distributing half a million sets, boosting the company's mailing list, and cementing Littleton's place as one of the \\"Big Five\\" American stamp dealers of the day.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pp. 147-149, 178-179. Entry into numismatics By 1954 the Littleton Stamp Company had grown to an operation of sufficient scope to employ 60 people, with fully 99% of the company's business done through the sale of postage stamps.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 198. Gradually an awareness developed of the parallel potential of the numismatic market, with the collectors of these items being greatly similar in disposition. Littleton began testing the water with the sale of coins and banknotes, employing the same essential approval sales business model based upon mass circulation advertising which had worked so successfully for stamp dealers for decades.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 202. Initial marketing efforts were rewarded and the decision was made to expand numismatic operations, with the company's name changed to Littleton Stamp & Coin Company later in 1954 to help spur sales in this new field of endeavor.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 203. Littleton Stamp and Coin continued in its company tradition of placing primary emphasis of creating and developing new collectors, making use of advertising in a broad range of mass-circulation magazines and newspapers not traditionally mined by sellers of collectibles.Steve Stecklow, \\"Firm Reflects Small-Town Virtues\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, July 21, 1992, page A01. Littleton effectively pioneered the approval method of mail order selling which had been long established in philatelics to the world of numismatics, sending out coins for review, to be either purchased or returned ‚Äî with no credit card requirement to guarantee the company's safety in the transaction. While the approval system sometimes provoked an incredulous reaction by those unfamiliar with the sales method, the company has indicated that over time the vast majority of those receiving such approval lots have proven honest in fulfilling the terms of the arrangement, with fewer than 10% of approval recipients proving problematic. Gradually sales of coins and banknotes began to catch up with the company's sales of stamps until sometime in the middle 1970s a tipping point was reached and numismatic sales volume began to exceed philatelic sales volume.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 204. Mystic acquisition In 1974, Maynard and Fannie Sundman purchased a long-time rival, the Mystic Stamp Company of Camden, New York. The couple's youngest son, Don, was placed in charge of the newly acquired operation. All remaining philatelic operations were transferred from Littleton, New Hampshire to New York at the time of the acquisition, with the New Hampshire operation subsequently strictly focused upon coin sales under a new name ‚Äî the Littleton Coin Company. A frenetic boom of precious metal prices and interest in coins for investment purposes in the late 1970s led to a bubble in the numismatic market as an anxious public sought a safe harbor for its investments in a time of rampant inflation in the United States. Littleton Coin Company briefly entered the rare coin market in this interval, attempting to bring a new crop of investor-collectors into its customer base.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pg. 218. A short-lived subdivision called \\"Littleton Rare Coins\\" was launched.O'Traynor, A Decent Boldness, pp. 218-219. This decision was ultimately regarded as a mistake, however, as a crash of metal prices in the early 1980s deflated the coin collecting boom and led to a mass exodus of the casual investor crowd. Littleton returned to its roots as a vendor of generally low ticket-price items to collecting hobbyists. In 1985, David Sundman was named President of the Littleton Coin Company.

He is Professor of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge at the University of Edinburgh, a post he has held since 2005. Between 2006 and 2013, he was seconded from the sociology unit to be Director of the ESRC Genomics Policy and Research Forum, more often known as the Genomics Forum. He has been designated a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He is currently Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities. Career Yearley was educated at Sir George Monoux Grammar School, Walthamstow, and studied natural sciences and then social and political sciences at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He completed a PhD in sociology, supervised by Michael Mulkay, at the University of York from 1978 to 1981. Due to the scarcity of sociology jobs in the UK in the early 1980s, Yearley had a couple of short- term positions before he got a lectureship in sociology at Queen's University Belfast in 1983. It was in Belfast that he began to concentrate on environmental issues and in the late 1980s and early 1990s he was closely associated with Friends of the Earth, the Ulster Wildlife Trust and Northern Ireland Environment Link. He became the first Professor of Sociology at the University of Ulster in 1992, returning to Queen‚Äôs for a short stint as professor there in 1994, and then moving to the sociology professorship at the University of York in 1995. He worked in York from 1995 to 2005, spending his last six years there as Head of Department; in York he worked closely with colleagues in the Stockholm Environment Institute. Yearley has also spent periods as Visiting Professor in Science and Technology Studies at Cornell University, at the Technical University of Denmark and at the University of Melbourne. Since 2006, Yearley has worked primarily as director of the Genomics Forum, a research institute funded by the ESRC and aimed at linking social research on life-science issues with a variety of audiences beyond the social sciences. In this role he has collaborated with among others the Human Genetics Commission, Citizens' Inquiry into the Forensic Use of Genetic Information, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Scottish Government's Health and Wellbeing Directorate and the Edinburgh International Book Festival. At the Forum, he focuses primarily on environmental aspects of the life sciences (such as issues around synthetic biology) and on new ventures in public engagement with the science and technologies of genomics. The Forum has hosted events including short story and poetry competitions related to genomics. In 2010, Yearley was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Yearley is on the editorial boards of the journals Social Studies of Science and Nature and Culture. With Steve Bruce, Yearley co-edited The SAGE Dictionary of Sociology. In 2005, he wrote Making Sense of Science: Understanding the Social Study of Science. In a review of that book for the Graduate Journal of Social Science, Yew Jin Lee wrote, \\"Overall this book is informative... akin to a tasty, well-prepared appetizer that prepares the way for more substantial courses to follow once the reader is prepared to do so.\\" Yearley is known chiefly for three kinds of work within this field: theoretical analysis of trends within the sociology of scientific knowledge, the application of arguments from the sociology of scientific knowledge to environmental issues and to the understanding of environmental controversies and campaigning, and work that demonstrated how public participation in the evaluation of environmental modelling could lead to refinement and better uptake of the models.

Lehrgeschwader were in general mixed- formation units tasked with the operational evaluation of new types of aircraft and/or with the development/evaluation of new operational tactics or practices. Each Gruppe within the unit was equipped with a different type of aircraft. Each Gruppe consisted of several Staffeln (squadrons). The Gruppe was identified by Roman numbers (I./LG 2) and the Staffel by Arabic numbers (10./LG 2). In 1939 Lehrgeschwader 2 thus consisted of a Bf 109 fighter Gruppe (designated I.(J)/LG 2), a Henschel Hs 123 ground assault Gruppe (II.(Schl.)/LG 2), and a reconnaissance Gruppe (III.(Aufkl.)/LG 2).  History  The unit was created to control the Lehrgruppe in the Luftwaffe. Stab and I.(J)/LG 2 was formed on 1 November 1938 in Garz. II.(Schl.)/LG 2 was formed in November 1938 in Tutow near the Baltic coast and III Gruppe at J√ºterbog. 11.(Nacht)/LG 2 was a specialist night-fighting unit formed in August 1939 in Greifswald under Oblt. Johannes Steinhoff, with Arado ar 68 & Bf 109-D equipment. In September 1939 the unit moved to Bonn-Hangelar and was redesignated 10.(N)/JG 26. I.(J)/LG 2 became the new I Gruppe, JG 77 in January 1942.  Operational history   I.(Jagd)/LG 2  Formed on 1 October 1937, the unit took part in the Polish Campaign, claiming six kills for three losses from 1‚Äì20 September 1939. The unit also participated in the Battle of France and the Battle of Britain.de Zeng et al. Vol. 2 2007, p. 376. One base in this period was Saint Inglevert, Pas-de-Calais. Its commander Oberlt. Herbert Ihlefeld, was its most successful ace, claiming 24 victories by September 1940 and earning the Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes. On 10 August 1940 future ace Hans-Joachim Marseille was assigned to I./LG 2, then based in Calais-Marck and flying sorties against England. The Gruppe claimed 92 victories during the Battle, for 22 aircraft lost and 16 damaged. It lost 10 pilots killed and missing and four as POW. I.(J)/LG 2 then participated in the Balkans Campaign. The excellent ground attack work carried out by its sister Gruppe (II./LG 2) had led to several fighter units, including I./LG 2, to also employing a Staffel of Bf 109s converted to fighter-bomber duties. Over Yugoslavia, Leutnant Friedrich Gei√ühardt was to claim four JKRV Hawker Fury biplanes shot down. Now with 36 victories, Ihlefeld was at this time shot down by ground fire and captured by Yugoslavian soldiers. While in captivity, he was allegedly severely beaten and was threatened with execution by firing squad. Ihlefeld was rescued by German troops after eight days of arrest and returned to Germany to recover. By the end of May 1941, I.(J)/LG 2 was based in Belgrade. The Gruppe lost four aircraft and five damaged and suffered one pilot killed and one captured.de Zeng et al. Vol. 2 2007, p. 377. During the Battle of Crete two Bf 109's Jabos of I./LG 2 were credited with sinking HMS Fiji with a loss of 276 crew. Following the successful conclusion of the Balkan campaign with the invasion of Crete the unit was withdrawn to Rumania for Operation Barbarossa. Geisshardt, after 6 victories in the Balkans, was to achieve much success over Russia claiming 28 victories with LG 2 and was awarded the Ritterkreuz in August 1941. The Gruppe scored 52 victories from June - December 1941. Total victories from September 1939 - 13 January 1942 amounted to 583 kills. I Gruppe was redesignated I./JG 77 on 13 January 1942.  II.(Schl)./LG 2  This unit was formed as Fliegergruppe 40 on 1 July 1938. During the Polish campaign of September 1939 II.(Schl.)/LG 2 under Major Georg Spielvogel, operated as a 'ground assault' unit in the Luftwaffe, operating the Henschel Hs 123. The unit flew numerous low-level pin-point ground attack operations, and included within their rank as a Staffelkapit√§n future ace and General der Jagdflieger Oberleutnant Adolf Galland. Spielvogel was killed by ground fire on 13 September however, and was replaced by Hauptmann Otto Wei√ü. By the end of the campaign 9 pilots had been killed in action; almost a 25% loss rate for the Gruppe.de Zeng et al. Vol 2 2007, p. 379. After resting and refitting, II Gruppe went west and took part in the Battle of France. Operating 49 aircraft, the unit initially flew supporting attacks for the German paratroop assault on the Eben-Emael forts in May 1940. Intensive sorties supporting 6th Army's panzer force took up most of May, before switching to harass the retreating French army south of the Somme in June. The outstanding efforts of the Gruppe and its biplanes in what was a unique role for 1940 were recognised with the award of the Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes to its commander and all three Staffelkapit√§ne. The units most notable action took place at the Battle of Arras, during which a strong British armoured attack was repulsed.de Zeng et al. Vol 2 2007, p. 378. II.(Schl)./LG 2 did not take part in the early phases Battle of Britain, and was mooted to convert into a 'true' dive-bomber unit equipped with the Junkers Ju 87. However II Gruppe had proved the viability of the battlefield assault concept enough to be converted to the new Bf 109 E-4B fighter-bomber, with the capability to carry one SC-250 kg bomb or four SC-50 kg bombs. Training took place at B√∂blingen. Based at Saint-Omer in France as part of Luftflotte 2, II.(Schl)./LG 2 started operations on 6 September 1940, losing two aircraft to flak over the Thames Estuary. With no direct Army offensive to support, the unit modified its type of operation, and through the winter and into the spring of 1941 kept up a series of sporadic nuisance raids against targets in England, suffering over a dozen aircraft losses. In March 1941 II Gruppe switched south to the forthcoming Balkans campaign, now equipped with 2 Staffeln of Bf 109s and expanded with two further Staffeln of the older Henschel Hs 123 again. The unit kept up a constant assault on the retreating Allied armies, supporting 12 Armee and its advance to the Corinth Canal. By now, inspired by the work of II./LG 2, several Jagdeschwader had their own specialist ground-attack cadres of Bf 109 fighter-bombers, including JG 77 and JG 27. The Gruppe were soon on the move back North for the attack on Soviet Russia in June 1941. Based at Praszniki in Poland near the Lithuanian border, II Gruppe, with 38 (37) Bf 109E and 22(17) Hs 123s, were tasked with attacking their share of the 60 Soviet airfields targeted on the opening day of the offensive, leading to the destruction of over 1,400 Soviet aircraft on the ground. Thereafter they formed part of the air support for Panzergruppe 3 advancing on the 'Central Front'. Featuring in the capture of Minsk in June, by the end of July the intensity of operations had led to an attrition of the Gruppe's available aircraft, culminating in just 14 combat ready aircraft. II Gruppe were transferred to the Northern sector around Lake Ladoga in August, and its impressive combat record again recognised by the award of Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes to its four Staffelkapt√§ne; Oblts. Georg D√∂rffel, Werner D√∂rnbrack, Alfred Druschel and Bruno Meyer. By September the Gruppe was back in the battle in central Russia, participating in the battles at Bryansk and Vyazma and supporting the advance on Kalinin. The II Gruppe Henschel's proved their rugged worth by launching a series of 'shuttle' missions against the counter-attacking Soviet forces in October, saving their own airfield from capture and inflicting heavy losses. The onset of the appalling winter conditions saw operations curtailed for some time. Thus the II Gruppe was recalled to Werl in Germany to form the nucleus of the first ever Schlachtgeschwader (SG 1), and with Major Otto Wei√ü awarded the Oakleaves to the Knight's Cross.  Aufkl√§rungsstaffel  Created on or just after the 1 October 1936 near Prenzlau. In April 1937, the unit was equipped with the Dornier Do 17 F. It was later merged 1.(F)/Aufkl.Gr122 in September 1937.  Stab III.(Aufkl)/ LG 2  Formed on 1 November 1938, it was renamed from Stab/Aufkl√§rungslehrgruppe. The unit was renamed Koluft 10 after mobilisation on 26 August 1939.  7.(F)/LG 2   8.(F)/LG 2   9.(H)/LG 2 (Pz)  Operated in the Polish Campaign, Battle of France and Battle of Britain. During Operation Barbarossa it supported the 3rd Panzer Divisions capture of Orel and Bryansk, it also supported the German Army during the Battle of Kiev.  10.(See)/LG 2  Formed on 1 November 1938, and dissolved in October 1939. Saw action in the Polish Campaign. The unit was absorbed into Kampfgeschwader 30.  10.(Schlacht)/LG 2  This unit participated in the Balkans Campaign and Operation Barbarossa. It was probably renamed 8.(PZ)SchG1 on 13 January 1942.  11.(Nacht)/LG 2  Formed on 1 August 1939 and experimented with night fighting techniques with Arado Ar 68s. It was used for home defence until 14 December 1939. It was still doing so on 18 February 1940, when it was absorbed into IV.(N)/JG 2.de Zeng et al.

His home was in Nuremberg, but otherwise very little is recorded concerning him. His name is mentioned in a register for the year 1449, and certain early productions in the years 1432 and 1437 are attributed to him. Though his carving in stone is rather rough, he stands alone among his contemporaries for his energy and realism. Works His principal sculptures are the colossal statue of St. Christopher with the Child Christ on his shoulder, at the south- west portal of the church of St. Sebald, a memorial of the Schl√ºsselfeld family, and the great \\"Entombment\\", dated 1446, in the chapel of St. Wolfgang, in the church of St. Egidius. The group is composed of eight figures of heroic proportions powerfully disposed. In the body of Christ the handling is hard, but there is a distinct attempt at correct anatomy. The head is noble and manly; Mary is full of grief; John raises his Master's arm to kiss it. The draperies are simple and finely arranged. This work is full of the new naturalistic tendency.

It is dark vinaceous (red wine-coloured) or purple, and grows with deciduous, or occasionally coniferous trees. It is commonly called the blackish purple Russula, or the purple brittlegill. Taxonomy Initially described as Agaricus atropurpureus by German naturalist Julius von Krombholz in 1845, and placed in Russula by his countryman Max Britzelmayr in 1893, the binomial name of this mushroom R. atropurpurea (Krombh.) Britzelm is accepted as being incorrect, and mycologists cannot agree on a suitable replacement. Distribution and habitat Russula atropurpurea appears in late summer and autumn. It is common in the northern temperate zones, Europe, Asia, and Eastern North America, and is mycorrhizal with oak (Quercus), with which it prefers to live. Favouring acid soil, it is occasionally found with beech (Fagus), or pine (Pinus). Description a mature Purple Brittlegill on Kaien Island The cap is in diameter. It is dark reddish purple, with a dark; sometimes almost black centre. At first it is convex, but later flattens, and often has a shallow depression. It can also be lighter in colour, or mottled yellowish. The stem is firm, white, and turns grey with age. It measures 3‚Äì6 cm in length and 1‚Äì2 cm in diameter. The closely set and fairly broad gills are adnexed to almost free, and pale cream, giving a spore print of the same colour. The flesh is white; with a fruity smell, similar to apples. It tastes moderately hot. The species R. brunneviolacea, and R. romellii are similar, though both have darker spore prints. As the fruitbodies mature, the caps become concave to collect water during wet weather, and much of the color washes off the rim. Spores Wales, United Kingdom. The spore print is Whitish, and the subglobose to globose spores ornamented with warts and ridges measure 7-9 x 6-7 Œºm. Edibility This mushroom is said to be the mildest of the hot-tasting Russula species. It is edible if cooked, although not recommended.

In the 1970s and 1980s numerous Croatian companies had Egypt and other Arab countries as a capital export market, including INGRA, and the Croatian authorities have been trying to re-create these opportunities with various investment-related activities. Numerous Croatian officials made official visits to Egypt, and most recently Hosni Mubarak was in Zagreb in October 2009, while Jadranka Kosor returned the visit in December 2010. Croatian companies made some inroads in the Egyptian market, notably including an oil exploration concession for INA in 2002 that became significant in 2007.
