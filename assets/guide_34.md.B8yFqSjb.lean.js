History In 2014, Steve Maman connected with negotiators in Baghdad, Iraq to build a network to rescue Yazidi and Christian women and girls sold into sexual servitude by ISIS. Maman founded the Liberation of Christian and Yazidi Children of Iraq in June 2015. Maman often visited Morocco and Iraq to purchase vintage cars to bring them back for his classic car dealership based in Montreal. During this time, he made contacts that would go on to help build his network of brokers within the ISIS-controlled areas. In June 2015, Maman founded the CYCI foundation with a team of negotiators in Iraq who would rescue the girls by paying brokers. The foundation started raising funds for their operations through volunteer donations and a GoFundMe account. Maman currently serves as the president of the foundation. In August 2015, Gill Rosenberg, the first female foreigner to join YPJ forces fighting ISIS joined the organization as a volunteer. Negotiations The CYCI foundations is primarily involved in negotiating with brokers in ISIS controlled territories for the release of captured Yazidi women and girls. The organization releases funds to their members based in Iraq who pay brokers for releasing the women. The organization first takes the rescued women and girls internally displaced persons camp in Kurdistan and later makes efforts to re-unite them with their families. CYCI raises funds through donations made on the official website and through crowdfunding portals including GoFundMe. According to Maman, each rescue costs between $1000 to $3000.  Criticism  Members of the Yazidis community which includes Babasheikh Kherto Ismael, the Yazidi spiritual leader,and those involved in outreach and humanitarian support dispute Maman's work and call for a greater transparency and oversight in the work with minority populations fleeing Iraq. Steve Maman Steve Maman, (born March 1, 1973), is a Canadian businessman, entrepreneur, social worker, and the founder of the CYCI foundation. Maman was born in Morocco on March 1, 1973, and was raised in Montreal, Canada where he became a vintage car dealer. Maman is married and is a father of six. Maman has often mentioned Oskar Schindler as an inspiration for the organization in his interviews and is often referred to as Jewish Schindler by news portals.

It is a single-stemmed shrub which is densely-branched with crowded narrow linear leaves giving the impression of a miniature pine tree. When it flowers in autumn, the shrub is completely covered with masses of very small, honey-scented, pinkish-purple flowers. Description Verticordia pityrhops is a shrub with a single, thick, densely branched main stem and a few side branches and which grows to a height of and wide, although some specimens grow to as high as . Its leaves are dark green and crowded, narrow linear, almost needle-like, long with a pointed tip. The flowers are scented and arranged in corymb-like groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on a stalk long. The floral cup is top- shaped, about long, smooth but hairy. The sepals are about long, spreading and pink, fading to white and have between 3 and 5 hairy lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the sepals, long, erect, egg-shaped, pimply on the outer surface and have a hairy fringe. The style is about long, curved and hairy near the tip. Flowering time is from February to June. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia pityrhops was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (pityrhops) is derived from the Ancient Greek words pitys meaning \\"pine\\" and rhops meaning \\"a shrub\\" referring to the habit of this species. Its common names include East Mount Barren featherflower, pine-like featherflower and little pine verticordia. George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Verticordia along with V. crebra, V. helichrysantha, V. plumosa, V. stenopetala, V. sieberi, V. harveyi and V. fimbrilepis. Distribution and habitat This verticordia only occurs in the Fitzgerald River National Park in the Esperance Plains biogeographic region where it grows in sand, sometimes with gravel amongst quartzite rocks, in heath and shrubland. Conservation Verticordia hughanii is classified as \\"Threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is likely to become extinct or is rare, or otherwise in need of special protection. It is also classed as \\"Endangered\\" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and is included in the Fitzgerald Biosphere Recovery Plan. East Mount Barren Featherflower is killed by fire and regenerates from seed. There have been fires in the region in 1989 and 2006 and the total population in 2008 was estimated to be more than 420 mature plants. The main threats to the species' survival are inappropriate fire regimes and dieback disease caused by the fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi. Use in horticulture Propagation of this verticordia is difficult. Cuttings have to be taken during a narrow window and seed set is poor. The few that have been successfully grown in gardens did not flower for up to five years but when they did so, produced masses of perfumed flowers on a bushy shrub.

The Act was signed into law by President Trump in December 2019, and came into force on June 17, 2020. A number of Syrian operated industries, including those related to infrastructure, military maintenance and energy production, are targeted. The bill also targets individuals and businesses who provide funding or assistance to the president of Syria. Iranian and Russian entities are addressed for their governments' support of Assad in the Syrian Civil War. The legislation imposes fresh sanctions on entities conducting business with the Syrian government and its military and intelligence agencies. It also aims to encourage negotiations by allowing the President of the United States to waive sanctions if the parties are engaged in meaningful negotiations and the violence against civilians has ceased. The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 has become a part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (S1790) as House of Representatives report 116‚Äì333. The House Committee Report, including Caesar has passed the Senate on December 17, 2019 with bipartisan support from both chambers of United States Congress. A few days later, U.S. President Donald Trump signed this bill containing this version of the Caesar provision to become law. This bill is named after an individual known as Caesar, who documented torture against civilians by Assad's government, which was to become known as the 2014 Syrian detainee report or Caesar Report. Human Rights Watch (HRW) further investigated this report, and produced an additional report titled If the Dead Could Speak. Photographic evidence from the 2014 Syrian detainee report has been on display at the United States Holocaust Museum and at the United Nations. Overview and origin Caesar sanctions are intended to create accountability for crimes by the Syrian government and its allies Russia and Iran. Sanctions are also to discourage foreign investors from doing business with the Syrian government, in an effort not to reward war crimes. Caesar sanctions will financially punish Assad and his associates for committing atrocities. Hence, the sanctions would mainly target providing goods, services, technology, information, or any support that would expand local production in the field of natural gas, oil and its derivatives. The sanctions also aim to deter foreign investors from signing contracts for reconstruction following the civil war. The legislation was introduced by Representative Eliot Engel as House Resolution 31 of 2020.H.R.31 - Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019, 116th Congress (2019-2020), congress.gov. It was incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act which was enacted and then signed by President Trump. =Implementation, requirements and exemptions= The sanctions would be implemented six months after its signature into a law, starting from 17 June 2020. The requirements of the legislation would expire after five years, i.e. 2024. However, Section 401 of the Caesar Bill outlines six requirements to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria: # End to Syrian and Russian aircraft bombing civilians. # Iranian, Syrian and Russian forces, as well as entities connected to them, no longer restrict humanitarian access to besieged areas and allow for civilians to leave freely. # All political prisoners are released, and the appropriate international human rights organizations are given full access to Syria's prisons and detention facilities. # Bombing of ‚Äúmedical facilities, schools, residential areas, and community gathering places, including markets‚Äù by Syrian, Russian, Iranian forces, as well as entities connected to them, ceases. # The possibility for the ‚Äúsafe, voluntary, and dignified return of Syrians displaced by the conflict‚Äù is achieved. # Accountability for ‚Äúperpetrators of war crimes in Syria and justice for victims of war crimes committed by the Assad regime, including by participation in a credible and independent truth and reconciliation process.‚Äù American envoy to the northeast Syria, William Robak, mentioned that the sanctions will exclude the areas of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. Debate over measure =Regional ramifications= In May 2020, the Syrian authorities imposed heavy taxes on president's cousin, Rami Makhlouf, and seized his assets in order to find resources prior to the implementation of Caesar Act. In early June, the Syrian pound underwent a dramatic collapse. The US Government stated via US Envoy James Jeffrey that the collapse would be exacerbated due to sanctions, and offered to help President Bashar al-Assad if he agreed to meet certain conditions for political reform. While US and international sanctions aren't specifically targeted at Kurdish-ruled northeast Syria, the area is impacted all the same with trade practically halted and because of the sudden plunge of the Syrian pound. On June 10, hundreds of protesters returned to the streets of As-Suwayda for the fourth consecutive day, rallying against the collapse of the country's economy, as the Syrian pound plummeted to 3,000 to the dollar within the past week. On June 11, Prime Minister Imad Khamis was dismissed by President Bashar al-Assad, amid anti-government protests over deteriorating economic conditions. The new lows for the Syrian currency, and the dramatic increase in sanctions, began to appear to raise new threats to the survival of the Assad government.. The Syrian pound sank to a new record low on Monday as investors scrambled for dollars ahead of new U.S. sanctions later this month, which many fear will tighten the noose around President Bashar al Assad‚Äôs government, dealers and bankers said. The Syrian regime thought it was finally out of the woods in its almost decade-long civil war. Analysts noted that a resolution to the current banking crisis in Lebanon might be crucial to restoring stability in Syria. Despite fears of a spillover from Syria affecting neighbouring Lebanon, it was conversely the collapse of the Lebanese pound that plunged Syria deeper into its economic quagmire. Rising Lebanese debts and a lack of financial ability to pay off these debts, with a seeming absence of political will to find a solution, led to capital controls being imposed. Throughout the war in Syria, Lebanon had been used by Syrians as a reliable place to withdraw dollars. \\"Syrians, who bought a lot of their dollars in Lebanon, suddenly couldn't access dollars, the value of the Syrian pound started to collapse.\\" Some analysts began to raise concerns that Assad might be on the verge of losing power; but that any such collapse in the regime might cause conditions to worsen, as the result might be mass chaos, rather than an improvement in political or economic conditions. While the world wasn‚Äôt watching, Syria has edged toward collapse, and Assad is claimed to be in his weakest position. The U.S. now has a narrow chance to prevent a catastrophe. Hundreds of protesters gather in the restive south of the country as the prices of everyday essentials sky-rocket Russia continued to expand its influence and military role in the areas of Syria where the main military conflict was occurring. Russia is increasing its presence in the wider Middle East and North Africa region through the deployment of its armed forces, the sale of arms and the establishment of new military bases. In recent weeks, it began negotiating the establishment of new concessions from the Syrian regime on its indefinite military presence in that country and has also become more directly involved in the civil war tearing Libya apart. On June 17, the United States imposed sanctions on 39 members of the Bashar al-Assad regime, including Assad and his wife. Former Deputy Secretary of Defence Mick Mulroy told Kurdistan 24 and ABC News that the Assad regime \\"has to be held accountable for what they have done to the Syrian people that resulted in over 700,000 people being killed and over 10 million being displaced‚Äù, that the international community also needs to \\"increase humanitarian aid and stabilization funding to the areas liberated from this despotic regime‚Äù and ‚Äúdo everything we can to help the Syrian people and everything we can to end the Syrian regime. They are one and the same.‚Äù On June 23, Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Muallem, held a press conference and mentioned that the United States seeks to \\"starve the people\\" and the sanctions would open the door for \\"terrorism\\" to return; in addition, he insisted that the Syrian government will cope with the sanctions with the assistance from friends and allies. =International debate= Analysts noted that the upcoming implementation of new heavy sanctions under the US Caesar Act could devastate the Syrian economy, ruin any chances of recovery, destroy regional stability, and do nothing but destabilize the entire region. Critics say legislation is being used for US strategy and could cause further problems for country and wider region. A leading analyst, Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: > ‚ÄúAssad is absolutely the prime driver of Syria‚Äôs ongoing collapse. [But] the > US position now appears to be fundamentally driven by great power politics > and the goal of ensuring that Russia and Iran can‚Äôt claim a win. My fear is > that Caesar will achieve the exact opposite of its stated goals, fuelling > the worst impulses of the Syrian regime and wider conflict. The US self- > declared maximum pressure campaign aims to bring the regime to its knees and > force its backers to concede defeat but the regime knows how to brutally > hold onto power and it‚Äôs clear that its key backers aren‚Äôt for moving. > > ‚ÄúThe Syrian people have been brutalised for a decade now and the country is > devastated by conflict but we appear to be staring into the precipice of a > dangerous new stage of the conflict ‚Ä¶ which risks a devastating new > unravelling.‚Äù Russia and the United States continuously argued publicly over the role played by each country in Syrian politics. Russia noted that its military presence had the approval of Syria's government. The rivalry between Russia and the United States in the Middle East continues to escalate as the countries exchange tense remarks over military presence in the region. In a statement posted on its official Facebook page on Friday, the Russian embassy in Washington, DC. criticized the remarks of David Schenker, the State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, who had said that Russia should leave Syria and described its role there as \\"destructive\\". \\"In response to Assistant Secretary of State David Schenker‚Äôs blatant call for Russia to 'go out of the Middle East' we would like to remind: Russian military is stationed in Syria at the invitation of its government,\\" the Russian diplomatic mission said in its statement. The Syrian government news agency, Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), reported that Russian Ambassador, Alexander Yevimov, said that Russia would seek to help Syria to recover and to develop its economy positively. Some analysts said that Assad would need support from major Sunni countries to stay in power, and that he would need the US to facilitate such support. In Spain, according to SANA, the Director-General of Cooperation and Human Rights of the Regional Government of La Rioja, Mayra Moro-Coco said that Caesar act would massively increase the suffering of the Syrian population, and would not improve conditions or human rights at all. Past versions Past versions of the bill included surveying the proposal of instituting no- fly zones over Syria. The neighboring countries might have been affected from sanctions such as Jordan. =S52/HR31 and related amendments of 116th Congress= Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 (HR31) has passed the House on January 22, 2019, and is currently awaiting in the Senate. S52 is the Senate drafted version of this bill. This version did not include investigating military means of protecting civilians. HR 31 was amended by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on June 3, 2019 to include congressional briefings by the President of military means meant to protect civilians, and obtaining data from organizations and countries in relation to Syria. =HR1677 of 115th Congress= HR5732 was reintroduced into the 115th Congress as HR1677. This bill passed the House, but stalled in the Senate. It was reintroduced into the next Congress as HR31. =HR5732 of 114th Congress= The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2016 was a long-waited act drafted by the United States Congress by both Democrats and Republicans during a lame duck session sanctioning the Syrian government. On November 15, 2016, it passed the House unanimously as The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act (HR 5732). This bipartisan legislation would have imposed new sanctions upon the Syrian government. This version of legislation would also have required the U.S president to report to Congress on the prospects for a no-fly zone in Syria. The bill would have authorized the Secretary of State to support entities that are collecting and preserving evidence for the eventual prosecution of those who committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria from March 2011 to the present, and would have required the President to report to Congress on the names of those who are responsible for or complicit in gross violations of human rights of the Syrian people. Related bills Stop UN Support for Assad Act and No Assistance for Assad Act are related U.S. congressional bills that have not passed into law. =Stop UN Support for Assad Act= Stop UN Support for Assad Act (HR4868 of 116th Congress) seeks to prevent the UN from misdirecting US funds to Assad, which funds his war effort against Syrian civilians. The UN mandates that humanitarian aid to Syria, even by non-governmental organizations (NGO's) be provided through the Syrian government, led by Assad, who they allege misuses it. =No Assistance for Assad Act= No Assistance for Assad Act has been introduced into the House of Representatives twice. HR4681 of 115th Congress has passed the House, but action hasn't been taken on it in the Senate. This bill has been reintroduced into the 116th Congress as HR1706, and this version is still in the House of Representatives. This bill would prevent funding reconstruction of Syrian regime held areas until war crimes were verified as halted.

Geography  Civil parishes of Gowran Gowran contains the towns of Thomastown, Paulstown, Bennettsbridge, Goresbridge, Gowran, Graiguenamanagh, and Inistioge, and the settlements of Ballyfoyle, Maddockstown, Whitehall, Castlewarren, Dungarvan, Rathgarvan or Clifden, Skeaghvasteen, and Johnswell. There are 35 civil parishes in the barony (see map). They are: Blackrath, Blanchvilleskill, Clara, Columbkille, Dunbell, Dungarvan, Famma, Gowran, Graiguenamanagh, Grangesilvia, Inistioge, Jerpointabbey, Jerpointwest, Kilderry, Kilfane, Kilkieran, Killarney, Kilmacahill, Kilmadum, Mothell, Pleberstown, Powerstown, Rathcoole, Shankill, St. John's, St. Martin's, St. Maul's, Thomastown, Tiscoffin, Treadingstown, Tullaherin, Ullard, Wells, and Woolengrange. Three of which are split between the Barony of Gowran and the Baronies of Fassadinin and Ida (Mothell, Kilmadum and Inistioge). Most of the eastern boundary of the barony of Gowran is formed by the River Barrow.  History The barony was part of the territory of the historic kingdom of Osraige (Ossory). That kingdom was almost co-terminus with the still extant Catholic diocese of Ossory . In the Church of Ireland, the diocese has been merged into the diocese of Cashel and Ossory. Gowran is currently administered by Kilkenny County Council. Gowran was recorded in the Down Survey (1656), and on Griffith's Valuation (1864). Parts of the barony were in the Poor law unions of Castlecomer, Kilkenny, and Thomastown. Territory of O'Carroll and O'Dunphy. Given to Theobald Fitzwalter (Butler ). Dobbyn family based there in the 15th century. Richard FitzPatrick was created Lord Gowran in 1715, and his son was created Earl of Upper Ossory in 1751. Both titles became extinct in 1818. Contains the ecclesiastical sites of Kilfane and Duiske Abbey. Woodstock Castle is in Gowran.

It is a lithornithid, a member of a lineage of flying palaeognaths, distantly related to modern ratites. Like many other fossils from the Green River Formation, it is exceptionally well preserved, bearing soft-tissue impressions of skin and feathers.Nesbitt, Sterling J.; Clarke, Julia A., The anatomy and taxonomy of the exquisitely preserved Green River Formation (early Eocene) lithornithids (Aves) and the relationships of Lithornithidae. (Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, no. 406), 2016-06-30 Discovery and Description The original specimen of Calciavis, AMNH 30578, was found in the Fossil Butte Member of the Green River Formation, Wyoming, dating to around 51 million years ago. It is an exceptionally well preserved specimen, preserving most of the post-cranial skeleton aside from the femur and associated pelvic region, as well as soft-tissue impressions of feathers, skin, foot scales and claw sheaths. Another specimen, AMNH 30560 , was found in the vicinity, composed of a similarly complete most mostly disarticulate skeleton. It is diagnosed by several features of the skull and pelvis as well as having metatarsals IV and II subequal in distal extent. It differs from the contemporary Pseudocrypturus by a shorter skull - in Calciavis the skull is shorter than the humerus, while in inverse happens in Pseudocrypturus -, as well as a proportionally narrower coracoid shaft and longer tarsometatarsus, from Lithornis promiscuus in aspects of the ischium, and from Paracathartes in a less curved and more gracile scapular blade. Feather imprints show abundant plumage with long primaries and remiges. In AMNH 30578 most of it is damaged due to post-mortem decomposition, with disorganised patches in the pectoral and pelvic region and the left wing traces and impressions being damaged, but the right wing is mostly intact, even showing evidence of barbules; in AMNH AMNH 30560 a wing is similarly well preserved. It is unclear if it had a tail, as the left wing feathers block the caudal region in AMNH 30578, but other lithornithids lack tail feathers. Phylogeny Calciavis is recovered as a sister taxa to Pseudocrypturus, as sister-taxa to all other lithornithids. Ecology Studies suggest that there was bare minimum of two species-level lithornithids in the Green River Formation at a given time, suggesting a high local diversity. Calciavis indeed co-existed directly at least with Pseudocrypturus, and though both genera/species are the only currently diagnosable lithornithids several other contemporary species probably belong to separate species. Comparisons with other palaeognaths render the possibility of both birds being different sexes of the same species unlikely, and both Calciavis specimens belong to adult birds, not juveniles of Pseudocrypturus. As mentioned above, skull and limb proportions are different among both species, implying that they occupied different ecological niches. =Flight= A recent study on Calciavis vindicates previous statements of competent flying in lithornithids, indicating that not only they were capable of sustained flapping but also migratory behaviour.

Genomic factors have a causal effect on clinical data. Clinicogenomics uses the entire genome of a patient in order to diagnose diseases or adjust medications exclusively for that patient. Whole genome testing can detect more mutations and structural anomalies than targeted gene testing.Veltman, Joris A., and James R. Lupski. ‚ÄúFrom Genes to Genomes in the Clinic.‚Äù Genome Medicine 7.1 (2015): 78.Robinson, Dan et al. ‚ÄúIntegrative Clinical Genomics of Advanced Prostate Cancer.‚Äù Cell 161.5 (2015): 1215‚Äì1228. Furthermore, targeted gene testing can only test for the diseases for which the doctor screens, whereas testing the whole genome screens for all diseases with known markers at once.Westblade, Lars F. et al. ‚ÄúRole of Clinicogenomics in Infectious Disease Diagnostics and Public Health Microbiology.‚Äù Journal of Clinical Microbiology 54.7 (2016): 1686‚Äì1693.  Uses  Clinicogenomics is currently used in personalized medicine such as pharmacogenomics and oncogenomics. By studying the whole genome, a physician is able to construct medical plans based on an individual patient's genome rather than generic plans for all patients with the same diagnosis. For example, researchers are able to identify the mutations that cause a particular kind of cancer by studying the genomes of many patients with that cancer type, such as in a study of renal tumors that were previously only diagnosed through morphological anomalies.Hagenkord, Jill M. et al. ‚ÄúClinical Genomics of Renal Epithelial Tumors.‚Äù Cancer Genetics 204.6 (2011): 285‚Äì297. Furthermore, researchers can identify the medications and treatments that work best on particular cancer-causing mutations, which can then be applied to treat future patients.Uzilov, Andrew V. et al. ‚ÄúDevelopment and Clinical Application of an Integrative Genomic Approach to Personalized Cancer Therapy.‚Äù Genome Medicine 8.1 (2016): 62. Clinicogenomics can also be used in preventative medicine by sequencing a patient's genome prior to a diagnosis in order to identify the known mutations related to medical conditions. In the future, patients could be sequenced at birth and periodically throughout our lives to be cautious of potential health risks and prepare for probable future diagnoses.Berg, Jonathan S., Muin J. Khoury, and James P. Evans. ‚ÄúDeploying Whole Genome Sequencing in Clinical Practice and Public Health: Meeting the Challenge One Bin at a Time.‚Äù Genetics in Medicine 13.6 (2011): 499‚Äì504. Through preventative care, patients will be able to change their lifestyles and behaviors to reflect their genetic predisposition to certain conditions.Potamias, George, Dimitris Kafetzopoulos, and Manolis Tsiknakis. \\"Integrated clinico-genomics environment: Design and operational specification.\\" Journal for Quality of Life Research 2.1 (2004): 145-150. For example, if a woman knows she has mutation in the BRCA1 gene, she can be more proactive about mammograms, Pap smears and other preventative care to help increase her odds of survival despite her likelihood of cancer. By detecting cancer earlier or preventing the development of diseases such as diabetes, health care costs for individuals implementing preventative medicine based on genomic data will decrease.  Challenges  Below are a few of the major challenges facing the usage of clinicogenomics by health care providers today. Other challenges also exist, such as the expense of genome sequence analysis and whether or not insurance companies provide coverage for sequencing. = Physician data sharing = One of the difficulties of genome testing is the amount of data from a sequence and the dozens of formats in which that data can come. This data needs to be standardized and added to electronic health records.Warner, Jeremy L., Sandeep K. Jain, and Mia A. Levy. ‚ÄúIntegrating Cancer Genomic Data into Electronic Health Records.‚Äù Genome Medicine 8.1 (2016): 113. It also needs to be in a format that can be utilized by both health care providers for comparisons, second opinions and future study as well as by machines used for processing the data for further analysis.Shabo (Shvo), Amnon. ‚ÄúHealth Record Banks: Integrating Clinical and Genomic Data into Patient-Centric Longitudinal and Cross-Institutional Health Records.‚Äù Personalized Medicine 4.4 (2007): 453‚Äì455. = Patient privacy = One of the concerns of utilizing clinicogenomics is the privacy of the patients throughout the process of collecting the DNA, analyzing the genome, and delivering the interpreted data to health care providers. In a study using HIV patients, the researchers encrypted the raw genetic data prior to analysis in order to maintain the anonymity of the patient. Then, a scientist without any previous knowledge of the patient interpreted the encrypted data. A report was produced and given to the physician for further study if applicable.McLaren, Paul J. et al. ‚ÄúPrivacy-Preserving Genomic Testing in the Clinic: A Model Using HIV Treatment.‚Äù Genetics in Medicine 18.8 (2016): 814‚Äì822.

Continuing these experiments at home, her father, the influential and stern John Hardcastle (Lucy), punishes her by sending Babs to stay with Aunt Cornelia (Spaulding) in Boston instead of taking her to Palm Beach. However, in Boston Babs finds fertile ground for her experiments. Aunt Cornelia has been for six years engaged to Jim Winthrop (Halliday), but a wedding seems remote as Jim has two unmarried sisters and an elderly aunt to look after. Something has to be done, so Babs sends a fake telegram which results in her going to Palm Beach accompanied by her troupe of Bostonians, much to the amazement of her father. Romance after romance follows in the wake of her experiments. Then comes the news that Aunt Cornelia, who was left behind in Boston, has married a college professor. That news does not break Jim's heart, for the \\"love expert\\" uses one of her unfailing remedies.

In 1183 he served as chancellor of the kingdom of Le√≥n. Of his stature in the Leonese kingdom, Roger Wright claims that he \\"would probably be now ... widely celebrated ... if he had only had a biographer\\", like his predecessor, Diego Gelm√≠rez, did. Christ Pantocrator, from the Portico of Glory completed under Pedro Su√°rez A native of Galicia, Pedro was probably educated at the University of Paris, where he earned the title of magister. Letters he later received from Pope Innocent III indicate that he had studied and taught theology at some point. He is in fact the only Leonese bishop of the twelfth century known to have studied theology. He introduced reformed medieval Latin orthography to the see of Salamanca and may also have introduced in the Leonese chancery. Perhaps also in canon law, at Compostela he patronised canon lawyers like Bernardus Compostellanus Antiquus. By August 1162, Pedro had returned from Paris to Compostela and was probably a canon there. He was appointed a chancellor by King Ferdinand II in 1165. By 1166 he had become an archdeacon at Compostela and was working in the household of Archbishop Mart√≠n Mart√≠nez. He was consecrated to the see of Salamanca by Pope Alexander III in Rome. As bishop of Salamanca, Pedro worked to achieve harmony with his fellow bishops. He negotiated an agreement of confraternity between the cathedral chapters of Salamanca and the neighbouring diocese of √Åvila across the border in Castile. He negotiated settlements to boundary disputes with the diocese of Ciudad Rodrigo, drew the diocese of Salamanca into closer relations with the papacy and supported the new Spanish military orders, the Order of Santiago and Order of Alc√°ntara. So far as was possible, he maintained good relations with both his own king and the king of Castile, Alfonso VIII, who were often at odds. It is probable, although contemporary evidence does not survive, that intellectual life first flourished at Salamanca under him. In 1173, he was translated to the see of Santiago. His successor at Salamanca, Vitalis, had perhaps been his prot√©g√©. The bishop of Zamora from 1193 to 1217, Mart√≠n Arias, was likely also a prot√©g√© of Pedro. The sources for Pedro's long 33-year tenure of the archdiocese of Santiago are surprisingly meagre. He came to the see of decades of disruption, which culminated in the dispute with the king in 1160‚Äì61. Much of the diocese's temporalities had been annexed by the crown or usurped by the Galician aristocracy, and the suffragan dioceses did not acknowledge the archbishop's authority. Pedro nonetheless maintained good relations with the Ferdinand II and Alfonso IX, even when the kingdom came under papal interdict because of Alfonso's incestuous marriage. He also settled many disputes with the nobility. In 1176, Pedro accompanied the king on his expedition against Jerez. Pedro reformed the administration of the archdiocese and enacted regulations for the cathedral chapter. He secured a steady revenue through the votos de Santiago, regular donations to the Saint James in gratitude for his military assistance. The construction of the cathedral of Saint James, suspended between 1140 and 1173, he resumed. During his episcopate the Portico of Glory was added. At Compostela, Pedro maintained a close relationship with the papacy as he had done in Salamanca. He received papal support for his reforms, and he attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. From Innocent III he got rulings that the dioceses of √âvora, Idanha, Lamego and Lisbon were his suffragans, but he had to give up claims on Coimbra and Viseu. He did not receive a ruling on Zamora.

Dr David Dowling, writing in the prestigious Landfall magazine on Johnson's first novel, Lear, comments: ‚ÄòJohnson makes an original contribution to the literature of distaster, and certainly to the nation's literature that still struggles beneath the mantle of social realism; he does it by the sheer intensity of his poetic vision, combined with an adroit metafictional sense ...

The episode was written by series creators David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf, and was directed by Norberto Barba. The season premiered a month earlier than most primetime shows on Monday night, instead of Friday. Plot Opening quote: \\"The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned.\\" Nick (David Giuntoli) confronts his mother, Kelly (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) about faking her death. She hides when officers led by Wu (Reggie Lee) and Renard (Sasha Roiz) arrive to arrest Kimura (Brian Tee). Renard notices that Kimura's tattoos resemble the Coins of Zakynthos. Meanwhile, on a cargo ship, a creature emerges from a container and kills officers. When the cops leave, Nick confronts his mom. She explains that while his father died, the other person who died was a friend. Kimura mistook her friend for her and decapitated their heads as a trophy. She has spent the last 18 years looking for Kimura and those involved. She also reveals that Aunt Marie knew about her status the whole time. Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner) arrive at Nick's house and explain that Juliette's (Bitsie Tulloch) potion causes a memory loss and dementia. While Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) investigate the attack on the cargo ship, Kelly deduces that the attacker was a Mauvais Dentes. Renard discovers Adalind is responsible for Juliette's condition and then poisons Kimura in his jail cell. Marnassier (Mike Dopud), the man who is the creature, then calls a man (James Frain), who is currently torturing a man for information about enemies. Marnassier kills two agents and demands Nick to meet him at a warehouse. Nick arrives and receives a call from Monroe and Rosalee, who claim that they developed an antidote for Juliette's condition. While he is inspecting, Nick is attacked by Marnassier. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 5.64 million people, earning a 2.0/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking first on its timeslot and second for the night in the 18-49 demographics behind Hell's Kitchen. These were the highest ratings the show achieved since the ninth episode in January and also a 10% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 5.10 million viewers with a 1.6/5. However, it was a 15% decrease in viewership from the previous season premiere, which was watched by 6.56 million viewers with a 2.1/6 rating in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 2.0 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. =Critical reviews= \\"Bad Teeth\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"The real episodic issue at hand is a Mauvai Dentes (I don't speak French, so I honestly kept spelling this Movedon. Please forgive me.), a saber-toothed Wesen assassin that arrives in Portland via a shipping container on a boat from Rotterdam. The guy murders brutally, with giant puncture wounds and savage slashes. Nick and Hank investigate the case a bit, but this premiere deviates from last season the most in terms of structure. This isn't a police case that spills over into Wesen territory. It just introduces the episodic villain that Nick has to deal with as part of a larger serialized plot. The CGI hasn't improved much and still looks kind of silly, but the gruesome violence the Mauvai Dentes leaves in its wake actually looks severe.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.9 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"The premiere did a wonderful job of recapping the final, climatic moments of Grimm Season 1, expanding the story by setting everything off on the right foot with the ship docking into Portland. Thankfully, even with all of these new elements that are being thrown in the air, Grimm still begins to resolve or clarify the current problems.\\" Shilo Adams from TV Overmind wrote, \\"Honestly, 'Bad Teeth' was kind of a great episode, you guys. I could go on about the increased intensity of the fight scenes, the vicious and visually strong villain (a Mauvais Dentes, a cat-like creature that could destroy an entire village and did take out a fair amount of people), or the fact that Grimm showed that it can change structure and not fall apart (Monroe and Rosalee shifting to the back for Nick to become the focal point), but the main reason that I liked 'Bad Teeth' was that it filled in a lot of the blanks with regards to background knowledge.\\" Josie Campbell from TV.com wrote, \\"While early Season 1 was hit or miss, Season 2 seems to have already learned from its predecessor's missteps. 'Bad Teeth' knocked it out of the park both mythologically and story-wise, and Grimm scored a lot of points for refusing to milk its mysteries and answering questions in a way that actually enriched the world.

It is one of 12 baronies in County Kilkenny. The size of the barony is . There are 10 civil parishes in Kells, made up of 167 townlands. The chief town is Kells. Kells lies to the south-west of the county, with the baronies of Callan and Shillelogher to the north (whose chief towns are Callan and Bennettsbridge), and the baronies of Iverk and Knocktopher to the south (whose chief towns are Piltown and Knocktopher). It has a border with County Tipperary on the west. The barony was part of the territory of the Ua Gl√≥iairn clan of Callann, and in the historic kingdom of Osraige (Ossory). Kells Priory is located in the barony. Today it is part of the Roman Catholic Church diocese of Ossory and the Church of Ireland diocese of Cashel and Ossory. Kells is currently administered by Kilkenny County Council.  Etymology  The name \\"Kells\\" developed from the ancient (pronounced Kannanas, accent on the first syllable). Still today Ceanannas is used by Irish speakers. After the Norman Invasion \\"Ceanannas\\" was corrupted into \\"Kenelis\\", and later into \\"Kells\\". From the 12th century onward, the settlement was referred to in English and Anglo-Norman as Kenelis, Kenles, Kenlis, Kenlys, Kenllis, Cellys (Deanery), Kyllis, and it has been Kells since the 1655. says that there is no mention of Kells in Ossory in Gaelic records, but agrees with John O'Donovan who suggests the name signifies \\"the head seat or residence\\". And that this is of similar origin to Kells in County Meath.  History Kells Priory in Kells, County Kilkenny. The 12th Century Priory, now in ruins, with outer walls still intact. Kells is located in the historic Gaelic kingdom of Ossory (Osraige). According to O'Heerin's Topographical Poem (1420) in the 1170s at the time of the Norman invasion the area was the territory of the clan called the Ua Gl√≥iairn of Callann. The \\"cantred of O'Gl√≥iairn\\" was located on both sides of the river Callann, now the King's River and included the present day barony of Callan. The territory of Callan was part of the early \\"cantred of Kells\\". In 1358 the \\"Barony of Kenlys\\" was very small and located in the eastern portion of the present barony. In the western part of the modern barony was the \\"cantred of Erley\\". The barony of Erley and the barony of Kells have been merged for many centuries. The barony of Erley must also have included the parish of Earlstown or Erley that is now in the barony of Shillelogher, and the townland of Frankford also belonged to Erley.

He has been described as a nature poet that interpreted his experience of nature with rapid, broad brushstrokes.Norsk kunstnerleksikon: Knut Monrad. In addition to his activity as a painter, Monrad also worked as a translator of English and Swedish literature. Monrad was born in Vestre Aker, the son of Hans Sundt Monrad and Astrid Haslum.Norske malerier: katalog. 1992. Oslo: Nasjonalgalleriet, p. 331. He studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry under Karl H√∏gberg and at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts under Jean Heiberg. During the Second World War he studied in Bjarne Engebret's painting school. He began his artistic path relatively late, and he consistently displayed subdued naturalistic expression. Landscapes drawn in broad strokes with a view across the land or sea were his main motif. He often used a limited range of color, with gray or blue-tinted coloring interspersed with green and gray shades. He participated in 42 exhibitions from 1952 to 1980. Among group exhibitions, he took part in the Autumn Exhibition eight times from 1947 to 1972, twice in the Southern Norway Exhibition (, in 1972 and 1978), and once in the Eastern Norway Exhibition (, in 1979). He also participated in the Young Artists Society's anniversary exhibition (1975). Monrad was part of the artists' colony that developed in Flosta after the Second World War. Together with artists such as Ferdinand Finne, Ellen Iden, Ivar Jerven, Kjerstin √òvrelid, Liv Nergaard, Finn Str√∏msted, Bodil Cappelen, and Finn Henrik Bodvin, an artistic environment was created that drew inspiration from nature and the skerries.Opstad, Gunvald. 1991. S√∏rlandet og malerne. Oslo: Aschehoug, p. 211. Many of Monrad's motifs are drawn from impressions of nature in Flosta, Trom√∏y, and Ytre M√∏kkalasset Lighthouse.

Kenji Utsunomiya, who ran with DPJ support in the 2014 gubernatorial election, withdrew one day before the start of the campaign in order to boost Torigoe's chances against pro- establishment rivals Hiroya Masuda and Yuriko Koike.

It was designed by Gerard William Barlow and built in 1938 by Kell & Rigby. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012.  History  Built in 1938, the Kingaroy Shire Chambers demonstrate the growth, prosperity and consolidation of Kingaroy as an important regional centre in the Wide Bay-Burnett. The arrival of the Kilkivan branch railway to the \\"56 mile peg\\" in 1904 was the impetus for the establishment of the township of Kingaroy, as a rapid expansion of closer agricultural settlement occurred in the surrounding region. Town lots were auctioned in that year and public and commercial interests soon clustered around the railhead. Earlier settlements such as Booie (1882), Taabinga Village (1892) and Coolabunia (1879) could not compete with Kingaroy's proximity to the railway. By the time the railway extended to Nanango in 1911, the township was replacing its older counterparts as the dominant service centre for the South Burnett. Initially, timber was the main product transported from Kingaroy railway station, with loggers capitalising on the abundant stands of hoop and bunya pine that existed in the softwood- vine forests of the region. Increasing land settlement saw large amounts of the existing scrub, eucalypt forests and brigalow cleared for agriculture, exposing a range of soil types, including the rich red soils, for which the region has since become known. By the 1910s, maize cultivation and dairy farming were replacing the timber industry as the key components of the local economy, while the region's peanut industry was in its nascent phase of development. The Shire of Kingaroy was established in 1912 by excising former areas of the Nanango, Wambo and Weinholt Shires and later increased in size with the addition of land from Wondai Shire. Kingaroy's first council chambers, a modest timber structure was built in 1913, with the first council meeting held in the building in June of that year. During the interwar period, a rapid expansion of agricultural activities occurred in the Kingaroy Shire. Dairying was the principal primary industry in the shire, with the Kingaroy Butter Factory one of the largest producers in the region, the outlet for the numerous dairy farms engaged in the production of cream. Kingaroy Shire was the centre for Queensland's burgeoning peanut industry, boasting over 550 growers and under cultivation by 1928, with the town's first timber silos built in that year. The district was one of the state's most important for corn growing, with the Manneum Maize Company farm the largest of its type in Australia in 1927. As the surrounding area's service centre, Kingaroy benefited from this growth in primary industry. By late 1937 the Kingaroy Shire Council had outgrown its small chambers. The four officers employed by the Shire were located in the chamber's small board room, and were forced to relocate to a shared counter during council meetings. Additionally, engine smoke from the adjacent power house periodically entered the shire chambers. In September 1937 a council meeting moved that a committee be instructed to proceed with the arrangements for the erection of new council chambers. To enable construction, vacant land adjacent to the existing chambers was purchased by the Council in mid-1938. The construction of the new chambers in Kingaroy was part of a wider pattern of civic building that occurred in Queensland in the 1930s. This period saw the construction of numerous council chambers, town and shire halls, and other public buildings in settlements throughout the state. While some were Depression-era relief projects, others were built in the latter part of the decade, when economic conditions had improved. In the South Burnett, examples of this pattern included the Nanango Council Chambers (1934‚Äì35), (demolished), Murgon Civic Centre (1938) and the Wondai Shire Hall and Library (1938-39). The Queensland Government played an important role in facilitating many of these projects, by offering low interest loans and subsidised labour costs, as a way of generating employment. However, this process did not occur at Kingaroy. After adopting the decision to build new chambers, Kingaroy Shire Council applied for a loan of to fund the construction of the building. The council felt it was uneconomical to pursue the path of State assistance, as by this time, government subsidies only covered around a third of actual labour costs, while the interest rates of a shorter term government loan were thought to be too high. Many shire chambers and town halls of the 1920s and 1930s are fine examples of the influence of modern architectural styles in Queensland townscapes. Incorporating elements of the jazz-influenced Art Deco and machine-age vision of the Moderne, these buildings were built as expressions of confidence in a bright and modern future. Stylistic elements of Art Deco and Moderne include decorative treatments like geometrical motifs, decorative vertical banding and a streamlining of the building form. These features are evident in many prominent civic buildings throughout the state including the Goondiwindi Civic Centre and the Southport Town Hall. Initial plans were prepared for the building by local builder Mr C Gill, who later collaborated with council engineer GW Barlow in the final design of the building. The construction of the chambers was undertaken by Sydney building firm Kell & Rigby of Sydney, Brisbane and Toowoomba. Established in 1910, Kell & Rigby's work in Queensland during the 1930s included Toowoomba's Empire Theatre, Stanthorpe Hospital and the Masel residence. The 1913 council chambers were relocated from their position between the new chambers and the powerhouse, to face the street directly behind. Kingaroy radio station, 4SB, circa 1938 The building of the Kingaroy Council Chambers coincided with a number of major projects in the Shire that collectively reflected the progress and confidence of the district. During 1938, the South Burnett's first radio station 4SB, opened its studio in the township and construction began on a new Kingaroy Hospital, regarded at the time as Queensland's most \\"modern\\". A new district office was established by the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock, an acknowledgment of the area's importance for primary production. The Peanut Marketing Board significantly expanded their operations by erecting large concrete silos (the Kingaroy Peanut Silos) on their processing site opposite the shire chambers. Kell & Rigby also constructed the silos, completing both the silos and shire chambers within a short time of each other. The Kingaroy Shire Chambers were officially opened on 1 December 1938 by the Minister for Agriculture and Stock, Frank Bulcock. Prior to the ceremony at the chambers, Bulcock officially opened the new silos. Conducting both of these ceremonies on the same day symbolically expressed the Shire's confidence and its progress since formation, while acknowledging its dependence on agriculture to deliver its future prosperity. The new chambers were a single storey building of brick and concrete. Silky oak timber was used extensively throughout the interior for the fittings, doors and furniture, the work of RV Rogerson's local joinery firm. Ornate plaster work adorned the ceilings while leadlight windows incorporating the Shire's logo were included in the main elevation. A detached toilet block was constructed at the rear of the building. A description written at the time of opening outlined the internal arrangement of space and features of the new chambers. The front central space, featuring a crows ash and ironbark timber floor, contained the public office for business and other transactions, incorporating the strong room. The left hand side of the building contained the health inspector and engineer's offices and records room, while the right side provided rooms for the accounting office, clerks and shire chairman. The centrepiece of the new chambers was the boardroom at the rear of the building. The room was panelled in silky oak, with parquetry floors of tulip and rose gum timber. A dais with seating for the shire chairman and clerk overlooked a \\"U\\" shaped table for twelve councillors, furnished with drawers and swivel oak chairs, and oak seating was provided for the public gallery. The Kingaroy Shire Council continued to operate from the chambers for over forty years. In 1979, new administrative offices for the council were built alongside the Kingaroy Civic Centre, as envisioned in architect Karl Langer's original plan of the complex. In December 1983, the former chambers were officially reopened by local state member and Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, as the Kingaroy District Development Board Tourist Information Centre. Kingaroy Art Gallery The former Kingaroy Shire Chambers is currently the Kingaroy Art Gallery, a component of the Kingaroy Visitor Information Centre, which opened in 2005. The gallery hosts monthly exhibitions by local and visiting artists in three gallery spaces, often including a themed exhibition from the South Burnett Regional Council‚Äôs art collection. It also features a shop for regional art and high end craft. As part of this complex, a new building was built between the chambers and the former power house (Kingaroy Heritage Museum). To provide a connection to the new building, part of the chamber's right wall was removed. The vestibule screen and original counter of the chambers had previously been moved to the museum building when it was operating as the art gallery. Despite these alterations, much of the Kingaroy Shire Chambers, especially its meeting room, remains highly intact. In 2008, Kingaroy Shire was amalgamated with Wondai, Murgon and Nanango Shires to form the South Burnett Region.  Description  The Kingaroy Council Chambers, a single storey masonry building with Art Deco decorative features, is located on Haly Street directly opposite Kingaroy's towering peanut silos. In 2012 it forms part of the Kingaroy Visitor Information Centre and is linked to the former power house (now the Kingaroy Heritage Museum) via a connecting building to the east. Its decorative Art Deco styling with vertical banding, geometric motifs and stepped parapet gives the building a strong streetscape presence. The front elevation is symmetrical about a central entrance and has a stepped parapet finished with a decorative moulding. The facade, finished with a smooth cement render, is divided into three bays by projecting pilasters with vertical banding. The central entrance way is flanked by single rectangular windows with concrete-formed architraves. The windows are metal-framed with multi-paned leadlight glazing incorporating the Kingaroy Shire's original logo and a pivoting central window panel. Large decorative diamond-shaped motifs are above the windows. The entrance way is sheltered by a horizontal, concrete awning with a moulded profile and supported on tapered masonry columns with a decorative vertical banding pattern. The entrance door is recent and is accessed via splayed concrete steps. Lettering \\"KINGAROY SHIRE COUNCIL CHAMBERS\\" is above the entrance and is framed with a simple decorative moulding and flanked by two stylised classical columns with fluting protruding from the facade. Flag poles rise from the roof behind the parapet. The west elevation is a rendered masonry wall with little decoration. It consists of a central service door flanked on each side by two windows. Decorative treatments similar to the front elevation are used including the moulded capping to the wall and around the window frames. Small hooded vents are set into the wall above each of the windows. The building's hipped roof is hidden behind parapets on all but the rear elevation and overhangs by approximately . The roof is clad with red corrugated metal sheeting. Gutters are quad profile and soffits are lined with timber battens. Window and door treatments on the rear elevation are similar to the western and front elevations. The eastern elevation is mostly concealed by an adjoining building. A parapet wall with a single multi-paned window is visible. Inside, the Council Chambers comprises a large open space (formerly the public office) at the front of the building incorporating a former strong room and the meeting room at the rear of the building. Hallways run down each side of these two large rooms providing access to several (former) offices. The front central space, formerly the public office, features a crows ash and ironbark timber floor forming a striped pattern. Walls are finished with hard- set plaster. Ceilings are also finished with plaster and are adorned with ornate plaster cornices and panels featuring geometric designs. Multi-paned skylights with coloured glass have been inserted where early pendant lights remain. Skirting boards and architraves are varnished silky oak. Several internal windows and openings are located in this room. One is a timber framed opening to the teller's booth set into the wall and features a metal grille. Others are leadlight glazing. The meeting room at the rear of the building features walls panelled in silky oak and floors finished with tulip and rose gum parquetry. A dais (seating the shire chairman and clerk) overlooks a solid U-shaped table furnished with drawers and accommodating 12 chairs including six swivel oak chairs. Silky oak public seating and timber screen are also located in the room. A vertical map cabinet is built into the wall panel on the west wall. Ceilings are formed from plaster and are raked near the wall junctions which are finished with a decorative plaster cornice. A central plaster panel adorns the ceiling from which early pendant lights are hung. Panelled doors, architraves and skirtings are silky oak. All timberwork including the furniture is similarly detailed. Offices are more simply detailed with plaster cornices and some feature decorative plaster ceiling panels. All rooms have silky oak architraves, panelled doors and skirtings. Floors are lined with hardwood boards though some have been covered with carpet. Some pendant lights remain but some have been replaced with recent fittings. The strong room is formed with thick masonry walls finished with plaster and has a solid metal door featuring brass door hardware. A small brass plaque with the words Ajax Manufacturing Co. is fixed to the door. Some early shelving remains together with an early timber rolling ladder. Entry into the adjacent museum is via a recent covered area accessed through a new opening formed in the eastern wall of the chambers building. Plantings in garden beds around the building are not considered to be of heritage significance.  Heritage listing  The former Kingaroy Shire Council Chambers was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Kingaroy Shire Council Chambers are important in demonstrating the growth, prosperity and consolidation of Kingaroy as an important regional centre in the Wide Bay- Burnett. It illustrates the pattern that occurred in Queensland after towns on branch railways developed as service centres for regions transformed by the interconnected processes of government-initiated closer settlement and increased primary production. Built and opened in 1938, the Shire Chambers are a tangible expression of a pronounced period of prosperity in the township, resulting from the rapid expansion of dairying, peanut production and other agricultural activities in the surrounding region. The Kingaroy Shire Council Chambers are important in demonstrating the widespread pattern in Queensland of expressing civic pride through building council chambers and town halls during the 1930s. Many of these buildings, including the Kingaroy Shire Chambers, are important in demonstrating the influence and spread of modern architectural styles in Queensland townscapes during the interwar period, illustrated by its use of decorative vertical banding and geometrical motifs. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Kingaroy Shire Chambers are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of shire council chambers. The building is prominently positioned on a principal thoroughfare of the township. Internally, the place features a front central space for public transactions, flanked by a small number of rooms, with the rear of the building housing the highly intact and finely crafted meeting room and record storage area. This spatial arrangement illustrates the requirements that facilitated the day-to-day operations of a shire council. Finely crafted interior joinery remains intact including the meeting room's table and chairs, dais, public seating and map cabinet. Externally, the building's vertical banding and geometric motifs on its main elevation demonstrates the use of such architectural elements in Queensland shire chambers and town halls of the 1930s. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Kingaroy Shire Council Chambers is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is a modest but elegant and well-proportioned building. These qualities are in contrast to its setting with the monumental peanut silos opposite forming a dramatic counterpoint. The building's prominent position on a principal thoroughfare of the township expresses the centrality and importance of local government to the community, while its design expresses civic pride and the confidence of Kingaroy Shire at the time of construction. The Kingaroy Shire Council Chambers is also significant for the outstanding craftsmanship of the meeting room. The chambers contains many finely crafted elements and timber joinery including walls panelled in silky oak and floors finished with tulip and rose gum parquetry, dais, meeting table, swivel oak meeting chairs and public seating and map cabinet.

He held the office of Governor of Jalisco, one of Mexico's most important states, from March 1977 until February 1983. Prior to becoming governor, Romero served as a deputy in the federal Chamber of Deputies for three separate tenures. Romero was born and raised city of Ameca, Jalisco. He earned his law degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he also received a degree in philosophy. He served in the federal Chamber of Deputies for three terms: 1955‚Äì1958 for the VIII Federal Electoral District of Jalisco; 1961‚Äì1964 for the III Federal District of Jalisco in the XLV Legislature; and 1973‚Äì1976 for the IX Federal Electoral District of Jalisco in the XLIX Legislature. He was the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1955.He also worked as an aide and advisor during the 1958 presidential campaign of Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos. He became a customs administrator in the northern, border city of Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. Romero, a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), held the position of Governor of Jalisco from 1977 to 1983. Romero was inaugurated on March 1, 1977. One of Governor Romero's first priorities was a crack down on left-wing guerillas, who were active in Jalisco during the 1970s. Under Romero, the state government launched Sistecozome, the bus public transportation system for the city of Guadalajara in 1982. Romero also renovated much of Guadalajara's city center, which culminated with the construction and opening of the city's large Plaza Tapatia, also in 1982, although such process involved the demolition of most of the historical buildings from the Spanish colonial epoch. On January 23, 1998, Romero was arrested and charged with aiding drug trafficking. Romero denied the charges and accused the then-President Ernesto Zedillo of being behind his arrest due to a political vendetta. Romero was released from prison on July 14, 2001, and later acquitted due to lack of evidence. Flavio Romero de Velasco died on July 2, 2016, at the age of 90.

His nearly decade-long research yielded valuable data, revealing the corporation-like workings of the street level drug trade, and serving as the basis of this book. The book is written as a first person narrative and incorporates some of the stylistic traits of fiction. The book begins with Sudhir's description of a crack den. The narrative then moves back in time, as we learn how Sudhir came to study the residents of Robert Taylor Homes. We learn that Sudhir was studying at the University of Chicago under Professor William Julius Wilson. After seeing the census figures for the surrounding area, Sudhir decided to take a questionnaire into a housing project run by The Black Kings, a Chicago street gang. He met the leader of one of the gang's sub groups, who advised him to adopt more qualitative research techniques and invited Sudhir to observe his lifestyle. Sudhir observed JT's life managing a drug-dealing business. Throughout the book, JT shows Sudhir around his gang's territory and introduces Sudhir to different members of the community. Sudhir discovers a complex community, often more cohesive and nurturing than the predominantly white community he grew up in, but deeply affected by racism and poverty. Sudhir slowly becomes accepted into the community and meets some of its key members -- both male and female.

Amnesty Thailand is one of more than 70 \\"sections\\" that make up Amnesty International worldwide. Amnesty International, as a whole, is an organisation of more than seven million supporters, activists and volunteers in over 150 countries, independent of government, corporate, and other interest groups. It works to mobilise public opinion to put pressure on governments that let abuse take place. The organisation was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977. Amnesty International Thailand was established in 1993 and registered with the Thai government ten years later in 2003 as an association. Its headquarters are in Chatuchak, Bangkok. In 2016, Amnesty International opened its South East Asia and Pacific Regional Office in Pathum Wan, Bangkok.  Campaigns  Amnesty became known to the Thai people during the Thammasat University massacre of 6 October 1976. After the successful campaign, more Thai people started to recognize Amnesty. After that, there were more people supporting Amnesty until the election of the Amnesty Commission in Thailand to attend the international Amnesty conference in 1993. AITH was established formally in Thailand in 2003. In June 2016, Amnesty International Thailand urged the Thai government to drop all charges against 13 pro-democracy activists and release seven activists who were campaigning to reject the new constitution draft in the incoming constitutional referendum. Amnesty International Thailand, together with Thai Netizen Network, launched an online petition to rewrite amendments to the Computer-related Crime Act aimed at keeping it in conformance with international laws and standards. According to Amnesty Thailand, the bill would pose threats to civil liberties, privacy, trade secrets, and security of the internet. Amnesty Thailand presents annual media awards to honour Thai media organisations and professionals who have produced outstanding reporting about human rights, in order to promote freedom of the press and encourage more such stories.  Missions  The missions of Amnesty Thailand are based on the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Amnesty Thailand campaigns and advocates for: * Economic, social and cultural rights * Freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom of assembly * An end to human rights violations in Myanmar * Ending the death penalty and torture * Corporate responsibility * The protection of the rights of the refugees and migrant workers in Southeast Asia * Ensuring that those responsible for human rights abuses are held accountable and that victims have access to justice, truth, and reparations. * Providing human rights education and training of trainers (TOT) to students, educators, community leaders, and government officials  Organisational structure  Amnesty International Thailand is composed of members who elect its board members and chair. Each year there is an annual general meeting (AGM) where the future of the organisation and other topics are being discussed and approved by attending members. As of 2016 Amnesty Thailand includes at least three main task forces: * Campaign ** Policy and Advocacy ** Activism ** Media and Communication * Growth and Mobilisation ** Fundraising ** Membership * Administration ** Finance  Support  Amnesty Thailand is financially supported by Amnesty International and individual donations from more than 1,000 members across Thailand. The first ever face- to-face fundraising program took place in January 2016 at Victory Monument, Ratchathewi District, and at One Udomsuk community mall, Bang Na District.  Under military rule  After the military seized power in a 2014 coup d'√©tat, Amnesty International Thailand has deep concern about human rights violations and abuses in the country. The organisation is criticized over being a rival of Prayut Chan-o-cha's government and as to serve Thaksinocracy in order to overthrow the royal family. In July 2015, a board member of Amnesty International Thailand was charged by the police for protesting against the ruling junta's curbs on civil liberties. According to the police he contravened Article 116 of Thailand's Criminal Code.

It is composed of a lower partial cloverleaf interchange serving as the junction between the South Luzon Expressway and Andrews Avenue (formerly Sales Road), and an upper T-bone interchange serving as the junction between the Skyway and the NAIA Expressway. The interchange was opened in two segments, with the lower interchange being built in the early 1970s. Rehabilitation work on the lower interchange was last undertaken in 2012 with the reconfiguration of an off ramp to improve access to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and the strengthening of the Sales Bridge, brought about by the number of vehicles using the interchange. Although the rehabilitation was scheduled to be completed by August 13, 2012, it was ultimately finished in February 2013. Construction of the upper interchange was recommended in the Metro Manila Urban Transportation Integration Study (MMUTIS), commissioned by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 1999, as a solution to worsening traffic congestion into and out of the airport, although no provisions for its construction were made when the Metro Manila Skyway was being built. On July 17, 2001, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and her Cabinet approved the construction of the NAIA Expressway, which would be funded through a Japanese loan package, and construction of the upper interchange began on March 17, 2004. The ‚Ç±1 billion interchange, which was built in four parts, was inaugurated by President Arroyo and other officials on May 30, 2009. The Sales Interchange is the last exit in the toll-free section of the South Luzon Expressway, although this is true only for the lower interchange. The upper interchange was free of charge until November 16, 2011, when tolls began to be collected by Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corporation (CMMTC), the concessionaire of the Skyway system.

Plot Simon Templar's friend, Roberto Lucci, has a car phone (uncommon for the era).

He served as Joint Downing Street Chief of Staff, alongside Fiona Hill, to Prime Minister Theresa May, until his resignation in the wake of the 2017 general election. Early life Timothy was born in Birmingham, the son of a steel worker and a school secretary. He was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Aston, Birmingham, and at the University of Sheffield, where he gained a First in Politics. He has cited as his inspiration in politics the Birmingham-born Liberal politician Joseph Chamberlain, of whom he wrote a short biography for the Conservative History Group. He has supported conservative philosophies which he believes benefit poorer people and has suggested the Conservative party should focus on benefiting all citizens. Career =Early posts= Following his graduation, Timothy worked at the Conservative Research Department (CRD) for three years, from 2001 to 2004. In 2004, Timothy left the Conservative Research Department to work as corporate affairs adviser for the Corporation of London. In 2005, Timothy took up a post as a policy adviser for the Association of British Insurers. In 2006, Timothy returned to politics after two years in the financial sector, spending a year working for Theresa May - the first of three posts on May's staff. In 2007, Timothy returned to the CRD, where he worked for a further three years. =Home Office= In 2010, Theresa May was appointed Secretary of State at the Home Office and appointed Timothy as a special adviser. He spent five years working for the Home Secretary, before leaving, in 2015, to become a Director at the New Schools Network (NSN). =New Schools Network= While at the NSN he spoke in favour of ending the 50% Rule which requires oversubscribed Free Schools to allocate half of their places without reference to faith. In 2015, Timothy wrote an article to express his worry that the People's Republic of China was effectively buying Britain's silence on allegations of Chinese human rights abuse and opposing China's involvement in sensitive sectors such as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. He criticised David Cameron and George Osborne for \\"selling our national security to China\\" and asserted that \\"the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies.\\" He warned that security experts were worried that the Chinese could use their role in the programme to build weaknesses into computer systems which would allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will and argued that \\"no amount of trade and investment should justify allowing a hostile state easy access to the country's critical national infrastructure.\\"Why have ministers delayed final approval for Hinkley Point C?, The Guardian, 29 July 2016Nick Timothy: The Government is selling our national security to China, Conservative Home, 20 October 2015 In October 2016, the Health Service Journal rated him as the fifth most influential person in the English NHS in 2016. Timothy has stated that he voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 membership referendum. =Downing Street= Following David Cameron's resignation as Prime Minister in the wake of the Brexit referendum result, Timothy took a sabbatical from his position at the NSN to work on Theresa May's 2016 leadership campaign. May's campaign was a success and Timothy was appointed Joint Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister on 14 July 2016. In spring 2017, May called a snap general election. As a result of the election, the Conservative Party lost its majority and became a minority government dependent on the Democratic Unionist Party for their majority. Timothy, along with Fiona Hill, faced immediate calls for his removal. Theresa May was also given an ultimatum by Conservative Members of Parliament, to sack Timothy or face her own leadership challenge. On 9 June 2017, Timothy resigned as Joint Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister. He, along with Hill, had been blamed by members of the Conservative Party for a disastrous campaign, which resulted in May losing a 20-point lead in the polls. Reflecting in 2020 on the projected cost of adult social care, Timothy wrote \\"Many things went wrong in that election campaign, but I resigned as joint Chief of Staff in Downing Street because our social care proposal blew up the manifesto.\\" =Journalism= Since leaving Downing Street, Timothy has worked as a columnist for The Daily Telegraph newspaper. =Brexit and antisemitism= In February 2018, Timothy denied allegations of antisemitism following the publication of an article of which he was the principal author that claimed the existence of a \\"secret plot\\" to stop Brexit by the Jewish philanthropist George Soros. In response, Timothy tweeted: \\"Throughout my career I‚Äôve campaigned against antisemitism, helped secure more funding for security at synagogues and Jewish schools\\". =2019 general election= In November 2019, Timothy failed in a bid to be selected as the Conservative candidate for the Meriden constituency in the West Midlands, for the 2019 UK general election.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50311030 The seat had previously been held by Dame Caroline Spelman, who opted to stand down as an MP and candidate over the \\"intensity of abuse arising out of Brexit\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-49593559 =2022 Commonwealth Games= In January 2019 Timothy was appointed as a member of the organising committee of the 2022 Commonwealth Games, to be held in his home city of Birmingham.

She served as Joint Downing Street Chief of Staff supporting prime minister Theresa May, alongside Nick Timothy, until her resignation following the 2017 general election. Early life Fiona Hill was born in Greenock, and attended St Stephen‚Äôs Roman Catholic Secondary School in Port Glasgow. Before turning to politics, she worked as a journalist in both the press and broadcast sectors; her experience included working for the Daily Record, The Scotsman and Sky News. She joined the Conservative Party press office in 2006, before spending a period at the British Chamber of Commerce, and then returning to work for the Conservatives. Career =Home Office= From 2010, Hill worked alongside Theresa May in the Home Office as a media adviser. She resigned in 2014. She left government after being forced to resign as May's special adviser in a 2014 dispute with Michael Gove over alleged extremism in schools, which culminated in her releasing a confidential letter on May's website, prompting then Prime Minister, David Cameron, to insist that May sack her. Hill then became an associate director of the Centre for Social Justice think tank, and in 2015 became a Director of lobbying firm Lexington Communications. =Downing Street= On 14 July 2016, following the resolution of the 2016 Conservative leadership election, Hill was appointed joint chief of staff to Theresa May, the day after May became Prime Minister. Little of her own political stance is on public record. Unlike Timothy, with whom she shared the post of Chief of Staff for a year, she avoided writing opinion articles. James Kirkup, who worked with Hill as a journalist on The Scotsman, suggested \\"it's probably fair to say that Mrs May only talks about modern slavery [as a priority for government action] because of Ms Hill, and that's not the only issue of which that is true\\". The 2017 general election saw the return of the Conservatives as a minority government, with their majority dependent on the Democratic Unionist Party, leading to widespread calls within the party for both Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill to be sacked. According to reports, Hill irritated the Scottish Conservatives in particular. They complained of her excessive \\"interference\\" and of being told not to run a campaign too detached from the one run from London. Nevertheless, their leader Ruth Davidson chose to ignore the demand, to achieve a considerable increase in the number of Scottish MPs. This result was crucial in mitigating the loss of seats south of the border and appeared to question key elements of Hill and Timothy‚Ä≤s election strategy: within days, and in the face of the growing backlash, both chiefs of staff had resigned. Personal life While at Sky News Hill met Tim Cunningham, a TV executive, whom she married; the couple later divorced. Later senior civil servant Charles Farr became Hill's partner.

Summary  How Not to Be Wrong explains the mathematics behind some of simplest day-to-day thinking. It then goes into more complex decisions people make. For example, Ellenberg explains many misconceptions about lotteries and whether or not they can be mathematically beaten. Ellenberg uses mathematics to examine real-world issues ranging from the loving of straight lines in the reporting of obesity to the game theory of missing flights, from the relevance to digestion of regression to the mean to the counter-intuitive Berkson's paradox.  Chapter Summaries  = PART 1: Linearity = CHAPTER 1, LESS LIKE SWEDEN: Ellenberg encourages his readers to think nonlinearly, and know that ‚Äúwhere you should go depends on where you are‚Äù. To develop his thought, he relates this to Voodoo economics and the Laffer curve of taxation. Although there are little to no numbers in this chapter, the point is that the overall concept still ties back to mathematical thinking. CHAPTER 2, STRAIGHT LOCALLY, CURVED GLOBALLY: This chapter puts an emphasis on recognizing that ‚Äúnot every curve is a straight line‚Äù, and makes reference to multiple mathematical concepts including the Pythagorean theorem, the derivation of Pi, Zeno's paradox, and non-standard analysis. CHAPTER 3, EVERYONE IS OBESE: Here, Ellenberg dissects some common statistics about Obesity trends in the United States. He ties it into linear regression, and points out basic contradictions made by the original arguments presented. He uses many examples to make his point, including the correlation between SAT scores and tuition rates, as well as the trajectory of missiles. CHAPTER 4, HOW MANY IS THAT IN DEAD AMERICANS: Ellenberg analyzes statistics about the number of casualties around the world in different countries resulting from war. He notes that although proportion in these cases matters, it doesn't always necessarily make sense when relating them to American deaths. He uses examples of deaths due to brain cancer, the Binomial Theorem, and voting polls to reinforce his point. CHAPTER 5, MORE PIE THAN PLATE: This chapter goes in depth with number percentages relating to employment rates, and references political allegations. He emphasizes that ‚Äúactual numbers in these cases aren‚Äôt important, but knowing what to divide by what is mathematics in its truest form‚Äù, noting that mathematics in itself is in everything. = PART 2: Inference = CHAPTER 6, THE BALTIMORE STOCKBROKER AND THE BIBLE CODE: Ellenberg tries to get across that mathematics is in every single thing that we do. To support this, he uses examples about hidden codes in the Torah determined by ELS, Equidistant Letter Sequence, a Stockbroker parable, noting that ‚ÄúImprobable things happen‚Äù, and wiggle room attributes to that. CHAPTER 7, DEAD FISH DON‚ÄôT READ MINDS: This chapter touches on a lot of things. The basis for this chapter are stories about a dead salmon's MRI, trial and error in algebra, and birth control statistics as well as basketball statistics (the \\"hot hand\\"). He also notes that poetry can be compared to mathematics in that it's ‚Äútrained by exposure to stimuli, and manipulable in the lab‚Äù. Additionally, he writes of a few other mathematical concepts, including Null hypothesis and the Quantic Formula. CHAPTER 8, REDUCTIO AD UNLIKELY: This chapter focuses on the works and theorems/concepts of many famous mathematicians and philosophers. These include but aren‚Äôt limited to the Reductio Ad Absurdum by Aristotle, a look into the constellation Taurus by John Mitchell, and Yitang ‚ÄúTom‚Äù Zhangs ‚Äúbounded gaps‚Äù conjecture. He also delves into explaining rational numbers, the prime number theorem, and makes up his own word, ‚Äúflogarithms‚Äù. CHAPTER 9, THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HARUSPICY: Ellenberg relates the practice of Haruspicy, genes that affect Schizophrenia, and the accuracy of published papers as well as other things to the ‚ÄúP value‚Äù or Statistical Significance. He also notes at the end that Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson claimed that Statistics is about doing, not interpreting, and then relates this to other real-world examples. CHAPTER 10, ARE YOU THERE GOD? IT‚ÄôS ME, BAYESIAN INFERENCE: This chapter relates Algorithms to things ranging from God, to Netflix movie recommendations, and to terrorism on Facebook. Ellenberg goes through quite a few mathematical concepts in this chapter, which include Conditional probabilities relating back to ‚ÄúP value‚Äù, Posterior Possibilities, Bayesian Inference, and Bayes Theorem as they correlate to Radio Psychics and Probability. Additionally, he uses Punnett Squares and other methods to explore the probability of Gods existence. = PART 3: Expectation = CHAPTER 11, WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE EXPECTING TO WIN THE LOTTERY: This chapter discusses the different probabilities of winning the lottery and expected value as it relates to lottery tickets, including the story of how MIT students managed to ‚Äúwin‚Äù the lottery every time in their town. Ellenberg also talks about the Law of Large numbers again, as well as introducing the Additivity of expected value and the games of Franc-Carreau or the ‚Äúneedle/noodle problem‚Äù. Many mathematicians and other famous people are mentioned in this chapter, including Georges-Louis LeClerc, Comte de Buffon, and James Harvey. CHAPTER 12, MISS MORE PLANES: The mathematical concepts in this chapter include Utility and Utils, and the Laffer curve again. This chapter discusses the amount of time spent in the airport as it relates to flights being missed, Daniel Ellsberg, Blaise Pascal's Pense's, the probability of God once more, and the St. Petersburg Paradox. CHAPTER 13, WHERE THE TRAIN TRACKS MEET: This chapter includes discussions about the Lottery again, and Geometry in Renaissance paintings. It introduces some things about coding, including Error Correcting Code, Hamming Code, and code words. It also mentions Hamming distance as it relates to language. The mathematical concepts included in this chapter are Variance, the Projective Plane, the Fano plane, and the Face centered cubic lattice. = PART 4: Regression = CHAPTER 14, THE TRIUMPH OF MEDIOCRITY: This chapter discusses Mediocrity in everyday business according to Horace Secrist. It also includes discussions about Francis Galton‚Äôs ‚ÄúHereditary Genius‚Äù, and baseball statistics about home runs.Scatter plot exampleCHAPTER 15, GALTONS ELLIPSE: This chapter focuses on Sir Francis Galton, and his work on scatter plots, as well as the ellipses formed by them, correlation and causation, and the development from linear systems to quadratics. This chapter also addressed conditional and unconditional expectation, regression to the mean, eccentricity, Bivariate normal distribution, and dimensions in geometry. CHAPTER 16, DOES LUNG CANCER MAKE YOU SMOKE CIGARETTES: This chapter explores the correlation between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer, using work from R.A Fisher. It also goes into Berkson's Fallacy, and uses the attractiveness of men to develop the thought, and talks about common effect at the end. = PART 5: Existence = CHAPTER 17, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PUBLIC OPINION: This chapter delves into the workings of a majority rules system, and points out the contradictions and confusion of it all, ultimately stating that public opinion doesn't exist. It uses many examples to make its point, including different election statistics, the death sentence of a mentally retarded person, and a case with Justice Antonin Scalia. It also includes mathematical terms/concepts such as Independence of irrelevant alternatives, Asymmetric Domination effect, Australia's Single transferable vote, and Condorcet paradoxes. CHAPTER 18, ‚ÄúOUT OF NOTHING, I HAVE CREATED A STRANGE NEW UNIVERSE‚Äù: This chapter talks about J√°nos Bolyais, and his work on the parallel postulate. Others mentioned in this chapter include David Hilbert, and Gottlob Frege. It also explored points and lines, Formalism, and what the author calls a ‚ÄúGenius‚Äù mentality. = HOW TO BE RIGHT = This last chapter introduces one last concept, ex falso quodlibet, and mentions Theodore Roosevelt, as well as the election between Obama and Romney. The author ends the novel with encouraging statements, noting that it's okay to not know everything, and that we all learn from failure. He ends saying that to love math is to be ‚Äútouched by fire and bound by reason‚Äù, and that we should all use it well.  Reception  Bill Gates endorsed How Not to Be Wrong and included it in his 2016 \\"5 Books to Read This Summer\\" list. The Washington Post reported that the book is ‚Äúbrilliantly engaging... part of the sheer intellectual joy of the book is watching the author leap nimbly from topic to topic, comparing slime molds to the Bush‚ÄìGore Florida vote, criminology to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The final effect is of one enormous mosaic unified by mathematics.‚Äù The Wall Street Journal said, ‚ÄúMr. Ellenberg writes, a kind of 'X-ray specs that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of the world.‚Äù The Guardian wrote, ‚ÄúEllenberg's prose is a delight ‚Äì informal and robust, irreverent yet serious.‚Äù Business insider said it's \\"A collection of fascinating examples of math and its surprising applications...How Not To Be Wrong is full of interesting and weird mathematical tools and observations\\". Publishers weekly writes \\"Wry, accessible, and entertaining...Ellenberg finds the common-sense math at work in the every day world, and his vivid examples and clear descriptions show how 'math is woven into the way we reason'\\". Times Higher Education notes \\"How Not To Be Wrong is beautifully written, holding the reader's attention throughout with well-chosen material, illuminating exposition, wit, and helpful examples...Ellenberg shares Gardner's remarkable ability to write clearly and entertainingly, bringing in deep mathematical ideas without the reader registering their difficulty\\". Salon describes the book as \\"A poet- mathematician offers an empowering and entertaining primer for the age of Big Data...A rewarding popular math book for just about anyone\\".

Byzantine primary sources, Cinnamus and Choniates, give little detail about this campaign; no dates are specified, and what they do say differs considerably. The chronology presented here, 1127‚Äì1129, follows that of Michael Angold and other scholars, but John Fine has the events taking place earlier in 1125‚Äì1126.Angold (1984), p. 154Fine, pp. 235‚Äì236 According to the Byzantine chronicler Niketas Choniates, the citizens of the Byzantine town Braniƒçevo \\"attacked and plundered the Hungarians who had come to\\" the Byzantine Empire \\"to trade, perpetrating the worst crimes against them.\\" Stephen II of Hungary broke into the empire in the summer. His troops sacked Belgrade, Braniƒçevo and Ni≈°, and plundered the regions around Serdica (Sofia, Bulgaria) and Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria), before returning to Hungary. In response, Emperor John II marched against Hungary in 1128, where he defeated the royal troops in a battle at Haram, and \\"captured Frangochorion, the richest land in Hungary\\" (now in Serbia). Following his victory over the Hungarians John II launched a punitive raid against the Serbs. Dangerously for the Byzantines the Serbs had aligned themselves with Hungary. Many Serbian prisoners were taken, and these were transported to Nicomedia in Asia Minor to serve as military colonists. This was done partly to cow the Serbs into submission (Serbia was, at least nominally, a Byzantine protectorate), and partly to strengthen the Byzantine frontier in the east against the Turks. The Serbs were forced to acknowledge Byzantine suzerainty once again.. In Hungary, the defeat at Haram undermined Stephen II's authority and he faced a serious revolt when two counts, named 'Bors' (possibly Boris Kalamanos) and 'Ivan', were declared kings. Both were eventually defeated, Ivan being beheaded and Bors fleeing to Byzantium.. Stephen was unable to participate in any of the fighting because he was sick, recuperating in his homeland, according to John Kinnamos. John Kinnamos wrote of a second campaign by Stephen against the Byzantine Empire, when the Hungarian troops, supported by Bohemian reinforcements under the command of Duke V√°clav of Olomouc, took Braniƒçevo by storm and destroyed its fortress. The Hungarians had renewed hostilities, possibly in order that King Stephen could be seen to reassert his authority, by attacking the Byzantine frontier fortress of Braniƒçevo, which was immediately rebuilt by John. Further Byzantine military successes ‚Äì Choniates mentions several engagements ‚Äì resulted in a restoration of peace.. Cinnamus describes a Byzantine reverse occurring before peace was established, which suggests that the campaign was not entirely one-sided.. Hungarian records, however, agree with Choniates in indicating that King Stephen was again defeated and was consequently forced to negotiate a peace on Byzantine terms.. Historian Ferenc Makk thinks that Emperor John II Komnenos was forced to retreat and sue for peace and that the treaty was signed in October 1129. The Byzantines were confirmed in their control of Braniƒçevo, Belgrade, and Zemun and they also recovered the region of Syrmia (called Frangochorion in Choniates), which had been in Hungarian hands since the 1060s. The Hungarian pretender √Ålmos died in 1129, removing the major source of friction..

Plot In a small town of the Russian Empire during the 19th century reign mores typical of that time. The mayor and the other officials take bribes, embezzle public money, drink and play cards, while idly discussing the latest town gossip. But soon alarming news arrives ‚Äì a stern government inspector from St. Petersburg has been sent to the city, and even worse, a plain-clothed one! Exactly at the time when the privy council is taking place which the mayor hurriedly organizes along with other rulers of the city, the news comes that Ivan Aleksandrovich Khlestakov is residing at a hotel ‚Äì a young man who is not paying the bills and behaves very suspiciously. The confused mayor and his staff decide that Khlestakov is the very same incognito-auditor from St. Petersburg. ...In reality, Khlestakov is a minor official who after losing at cards fared up in this town without a penny of money. When the rulers of the city are beginning to cautiously deal with the \\"formidable auditor\\", by trying to find out something from him, Khlestakov gradually realizes that he has been mistaken for a \\"significant person\\" and that this circumstance can be very beneficial for him. Always keeping the mayor and his minions afraid with tales of his high position in Petersburg, Khlestakov begins to \\"borrow\\" from everyone, and in fact - to extort the duped and intimidated city officials of money. The mayor, judge, head of post and others - all carry and bear money to the \\"auditor of St. Petersburg\\"... Then the \\"cash flow\\" increases: merchants and traders of the city begin to bear \\"offerings\\" to Khlestakov, asking to protect them from the mayor's harassment. Crazed from impunity, Khlestakov makes an offer of marriage, nearly seduces the daughter of the mayor, but soon leaves, supposedly to \\"visit to his uncle\\". And soon sounds the thunder... The postmaster opens the letter, which Khlestakov sent to a friend in St. Petersburg, and nearly faints from the shock! He runs to the mayor and other officials who are celebrating the engagement of the mayor's daughter and \\"the powerful official\\", and blows them away with mind-boggling news: Khlestakov is an impostor who has completely fooled them! Suddenly a harsh voice from a gendarme is heard: \\"An official who has arrived on behalf of the command of St. Petersburg, requires you to come to him at this very hour. He is staying at a hotel\\". And a famous \\"silent scene\\" follows: with bulging eyes, the burned embezzlers who were deceived by the petty crook with brilliant simplicity, stare at each other in shocked silence...

It is also known as Murgon Public Hall. It was designed by Clifford Ernest Plant and built in 1938 by HG Neilsen. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012.  History  The Murgon Civic Centre, located on the corner of Murgon's principal intersection, Lamb and Gore Streets, was built in 1938 - a period of civic pride expressed in the building of town halls and council chambers throughout Queensland - to serve this important South Burnett town. Designed by Brisbane architect Clifford Ernest Plant, the Murgon Civic Centre was constructed by Maryborough builder HG Neilsen. Comprising a hall, former library, four shops and a corner clock tower, this Art Deco complex makes a major contribution to the streetscape of Murgon. The town of Murgon grew around the location of an unattended siding on the railway line from Kilkivan, which opened on 14 September 1903. The railway was the crucial causal factor in the vast influx of selectors who took up land excised from Barambah Station in 1902 and again in 1913 and provided the stimulus for the development of Murgon as a service centre. The railway facilitated selectors sending their produce ‚Äî maize and pumpkins, pigs, cattle and dairy products ‚Äî to markets. Within the first decade of the town's existence two hotels opened, various stores operated, a combined newsagent, tobacconist and barber's shop opened, a Methodist Church was completed and Murphy's Hall was hosting meetings of the Salvation Army and other religious groups. Murgon's butter factory opened in 1913. Further stimuli to Murgon's development were the creation of the Shire of Murgon and the construction of two branch lines from Murgon to Proston and to Windera. The new shire was formed from parts of Weinholt and Kilkivan Shires on 16 January 1914, with Murgon as its administrative centre. The Murgon Shire Chambers were located in Macalister Street by 1919. The two branch rail lines were completed in February 1923 and in March 1925 respectively, making Murgon an important railway junction. By the mid- to late-1930s Murgon was rapidly expanding as a service centre for its surrounding agricultural community. The Shire of Murgon, covered 271 square miles and had a total population of 4000. Major improvements to the town of Murgon during the decade from 1928 to 1938 amounted to . In 1938 dairying in the Burnett district was burgeoning, having the second largest number of dairy herds and of dairy cows in Queensland after Moreton district. By 1941 Murgon was the second largest centre in the South Burnett with a population of 1091; after Kingaroy, the largest town with 2300 persons. By 1938 plans for the construction of a civic centre at a cost of were underway. Tenders were called by the architect, CE Plant, in September 1937 and closed in January 1938. HG Neilsen's tender was accepted. Building took place during 1938 and the Murgon Town Hall was officially opened on 16 December 1938 by the Minister for Agriculture, Frank Bulcock. The opening was celebrated with a ball and supper to which all residents of the shire were invited. The building incorporated a main auditorium, library, reading room, and Returned Soldiers' League room along Gore Street, a corner clock tower, and five shops facing Lamb Street. Part of the building was situated on the site of the original School of Arts building and several shops. These were removed to the show grounds and redeveloped under the supervision of CE Plant. The new town hall took over many of the functions of the old School of Arts. Town halls of varying design and dimension are landmarks of Australia's cities and suburbs, shires and towns. They have been important as social venues and focal points for their communities and also for the administration of local government. However, it is from an architectural viewpoint that they are probably best remembered. Numerous town halls were constructed across Australia during the second half of the 1930s as an expression of civic pride when the economy was once again on a more secure foundation after the Great Depression. During the late 1930s many Queensland country towns were engaged in erecting or remodelling civic buildings. More than 20 centres built new shire and council buildings while shire halls at Wambo, Boulia, Woongarra, Gympie, Cunnamulla and Aramac were remodelled. Within the last two years of the 1930s, more than was spent on new shire and council halls and nearly was outlaid on alterations to existing buildings. This building programme was encouraged by the Queensland Government through subsidies to councils. In Queensland the design of these town halls spanned the spectrum from strict axial classicism (Childers) to Goondiwindi Civic Centre's highly personal and rich Art Deco-inspired style. Typical was the vertically or striated masonry facade, found for example in the Johnstone Shire Hall at Innisfail (1938) and in the Rockhampton Town Hall (1941); both of which were substantial buildings serving prosperous centres of primary industry. According to architect Ian Sinnamon, author of Putting on a brave front: Queensland between the wars, the Murgon Civic Centre, though more humble in size and resources, is a virtuoso piece of its kind. It and the Johnstone Shire Hall are the only known 1930s Art Deco reinforced concrete municipal buildings of this style and scale in Queensland. The Murgon Civic Centre is one of the interwar shire chambers and town halls that are fine examples of the influence of modern architectural styles in Queensland townscapes. Incorporating elements of the jazz-influenced Art Deco and the machine-age vision of the Moderne, these buildings were built as expressions of confidence in a bright and modern future. Stylistic elements of Art Deco and the Moderne include decorative treatments like geometrical motifs, decorative vertical banding and a streamlining of the building form. These features are evident in many prominent civic buildings throughout the State including the Kingaroy Shire Council Chambers, Goondiwindi Civic Centre, Southport Town Hall and Gayndah Shire Hall. Architect CE Plant, designed a number of public buildings in south- east Queensland during the 1930s. These include the Kings Beach Bathing Pavilion at Caloundra, Dalby swimming pool, five bathing pavilions on the Redcliffe peninsula and the Sandgate Bathing Pavilion (demolished). Born in Cheadle, England in 1885 Plant was articled as a pupil and then architect's assistant in England from 1902. He was employed by the Queensland Government in the Department of Railways as a draftsman 1911‚Äì14; was employed as an instructor by the Brisbane Central Technical College; served during World War I (1915‚Äì20) before returning to the Central Technical College and working for the Department of Railways during the 1920s. Plant became registered as an architect in Queensland from 1929. His architectural practice however, dated from October 1926 and in the following year he designed premises in Adelaide Street, Brisbane for auctioneers Blocksidge and Ferguson. He produced many residences in Brisbane during the 1920s and 1930s, some influenced by the Spanish Mission style, while other works explored contemporary architectural styles such as the Moderne and neo- Georgian. The exterior of the Murgon Civic Centre is quite intact, although some alterations have been made and the complex has been repainted. The Library building has had a number of functions since 1938. It housed some high school classes before the Murgon State High School was built in 1945 and acted as temporary shire council offices to 1964 until the Shire Council Offices were erected diagonally opposite on Gore Street in the early 1960s. After the building's completion the library transferred there from the Murgon Civic Centre. Currently, the former library is used as office space. Its asbestos roof was replaced with corrugated metal sheeting after 1995. The town hall continues to be used for its original purpose. Internal alterations to the hall were made in 1972 by Stuart Reed and Associates. Air conditioning, sound proofing and new electrical systems have been added. New changing rooms and a new loading dock were added to the northern end. On either side of the stage, new walls and new openings were added and partitions were removed, altering access to the wings. The kitchen has been refitted. Of the five shops, only the two occupied by the Commonwealth Bank have been substantially altered internally. The shops' original flat awning with signage along the street frontage has been replaced with a convex sheet metal awning.  Description  The Murgon Civic Centre is located on the corner of Murgon's main intersection and comprises a public hall, former library (now offices) and four shops. A central clock tower gives the building prominence in the streetscape and acts as a pivotal point with shops extending from it to south-west along Lamb Street and with the public hall and library extending from it along Gore Street to the north-west. The Murgon Civic Centre is a stately building with a strong presence in Murgon, forming part of the Murgon shopping precinct, and at the rear is bordered by the railway lines to Kilkivan and Proston. The Civic Centre has Art Deco design features including a streamlined appearance, horizontal and vertical banding, simple geometric decoration and three- dimensional massing which emphasise important elements such as entrance ways. The street-facing elevations have stepped parapets and are finished in roughcast cement render with decorative elements accentuated with contrasting paint colours. = Public Hall = The public hall is a double height space with a rectangular footprint. It comprises an auditorium, mezzanine and supper room. The main elevation is symmetrical and links to the former library via a low screen wall. It is constructed with a masonry frame and is finished with a roughcast cement render. A stepped parapet with geometric banding partly conceals a gabled roof which covers the auditorium space and is clad in painted corrugated metal sheeting. Each end of the main elevation is emphasised with a projecting tower. The northernmost tower accommodates the auditorium entrance which has recessed double doors sheltered by a cantilevered masonry awning with decorative edging. The entrance porch is accessed via a short flight of stairs framed by wide columns with decorative horizontal banding. Plaques commemorating the opening of the building have been fixed to the columns below a chevron motif. Vertical banding rises above the awning to stylised lettering forming the words \\"PUBLIC HALL\\". The northernmost tower reads as another entrance mirroring the form of the southern end but is in-filled with a multi-paned window above a solid base decorated with a three-dimensional chevron motif. Vertical banding rises above a second-level angled metal-framed window. The parapet of each tower is decorated with parallel sweeping curves. Tall masonry buttresses formed by the building's concrete frame punctuate the elevation between the towers and frame tall metal-framed windows with truncated tops. Transoms decorated with horizontal banding divide each of the window bays. Two secondary entrances are sheltered by smaller cantilevered awnings. The hall is set on a solid masonry plinth and is separated from the footpath by a low garden bed. Metal rain- heads drain from gutters concealed behind the parapet. A supper room is located at the rear of the building and is a long lean-to structure attached to the auditorium. It has a corrugated metal roof and is clad with weatherboards. It is punctuated with simple timber-framed casement windows. Gable ends of the main building are clad in fibrous cement sheeting. Recent single level change rooms, a loading dock and a small kitchen extension have been added to the library end of the building. These are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Internally the building comprises a foyer space with a mezzanine level above (seating 100 people), an auditorium (seating 300 people) and a stage located at the library end. The auditorium is a wide space with a flat, recently installed, acoustic panelled ceiling with recessed lighting. Walls, finished with hardset plaster, are punctuated by the street-facing windows. These are mirrored on the opposite wall, which separates the auditorium from the supper room, by openings filled with timber screening forming a chevron pattern. The stage is simply detailed and lined with fibrous cement sheeting and accessed via double steel-framed steps. The mezzanine level is accessed via simple timber-framed, enclosed-riser stairs. It has little decoration and is furnished with early fixed seating. The foyer space is simply detailed with a flat ceiling lined with fibrous cement joined with timber cover strips. It contains a small box office and double doors provide access into the auditorium. The supper room is a lofty space with exposed roof framing consisting of triangular timber trusses supported on the auditorium's concrete frame and bracketed off the external wall. Walls and raked ceilings are lined with fibrous cement sheeting joined with timber cover strips. Floors throughout the public hall are lined with clear-finished hardwood tongue and grove boards. = Former Library = The former Library building is a timber-framed building of a more domestic scale with a stepped parapet masonry facade. It is low-set with a hipped roof clad with painted corrugated metal sheeting. The roof is partly concealed by the parapet wall which is finished with rough-cast cement render. The parapet is simply decorated with horizontal banding. A curved cantilevered street awning supported on a steel frame shelters a centrally-placed entrance door with timber- framed casements on either side. A curved garden bed separates the building from the footpath. Other elevations are plain with walls clad in fibrous cement sheeting. Internally the building comprises several office spaces. Walls and ceilings are lined with fibrous cement sheeting joined with cover strips and floors are lined with carpet. Internal doors are panelled timber. Cornices and picture rails are simply detailed and formed from timber. = Shops = Four shops run along Lamb Street with the clock tower located above the corner shop. The shops are timber framed with masonry external walls which form a parapet to the roof behind. A recent curved street awning supported on steel posts has been installed. The roof slopes away from the street to the north-east and is clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The clock tower mirrors the design of the public hall entrance projections with vertical banding rising to the clock face. The clock face is square and is flush with the facade. The two central shops retain some original shopfront glazing. Central, recessed timber-panelled shop doors with multi-paned glass remain to these shops. They are framed by sheet glass shop windows with multi-paned horizontal glazing above. Internally ceilings and walls are unchanged and lined with fibrous cement sheeting joined with timber cover strips. Floors are lined with vinyl sheeting. The corner shop is covered with advertising or in- filled with sheeting and access into the shop is via a metal roller-door. Sheet glass remains either side of the entrance. The fourth shop space has been substantially altered in accordance with the needs of a modern banking facility and an ATM has been installed into the front wall. Early awning windows punctuate the south-east elevation. On Gore Street a large conifer shields the building (not considered to be of cultural heritage significance) and a low concrete-formed garden bed filled with flowering shrubs separates the public hall and the library building from the footpath. A loading dock and bitumened service road accesses the complex adjacent to the library building and leads to a bitumened carpark at the rear of the supper hall. The building overlooks the Royal Hotel on the opposite side of Gore Street and the Murgon War Memorial to the south.  Heritage listing  Murgon Civic Centre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Murgon Civic Centre (1938) is the result of the growth of Murgon as a major service town in the South Burnett region in the inter-war period. It is important in demonstrating the development of agricultural settlements and establishment of their service towns in rural Queensland up to World War II through the Queensland government's policy of closer settlement of the land facilitated by branch railway lines. The Murgon Civic Centre is also important in demonstrating the widespread pattern in Queensland of expressing civic pride through building council chambers and town halls during the 1930s. While some were Depression-era relief projects, others, such as Murgon Civic Centre, were built in the latter part of the decade, when economic conditions had improved and expectations for a prosperous future were high. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Murgon Civic Centre is a good, representative and intact example of a regional Art Deco and Moderne-inspired civic centre. It is one of a group of fine town and shire halls built throughout Queensland in the 1930s in response to improved economic times post-Depression. The Murgon complex displays the principal features of these civic buildings, combining a public hall, library (now offices) shops and a clock tower. Like other town hall complexes, it is the focal point of the community and is located near the centre of the town on the corner of Murgon's principal streets. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Murgon Civic Centre is important for its contribution to the townscape of Murgon. Situated at the principal intersection the clock tower is designed to address the corner and ensure the complex's prominence in the streetscape. The Art Deco influences - linear form, stepped skylines, chevron motifs and decorative horizontal banding - enhance the aesthetic appeal of the complex.

It was founded in 1911, during the Universal Congress of Esperanto in Anvers. Its members from very diverse backgrounds, mostly protestant churches. KELI publishes a bimonthly magazine, Dia Regno, which started to appear regularly in 1908, when the German Paul H√ºbner was sure that five people would subscribe. Now the magazine serves as a tool among members in 48 countries from diverse faiths, Adventists to Quakers, Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, etc., but also people of the Eastern Orthodoxy. In the beginning, it was important to have basic literature. In 1912, the New Testament was published and then in 1926 the entire Bible with the Zamenhof's Old Testament translation - not privately, but in the British and Foreign Bible Society. That way, it is possible to continually have Esperanto Bibles in every Christian Bookstore throughout the entire world. Also, an edition having the deuterocanonical books (translated by Gerrit berveling of Netherlands) was published in 2003. In 1971, KELI had an official hymnal \\"Adoru Kantante\\" (Worship by Singing) with 262 songs (mostly classics), from many countries and languages, with four part harmony - a beautiful book, done professionally. Recently, conferences have used more modest looking song collections, \\"Tero kaj Chielo Kantu\\" (Earth and Heaven Sing) with 161 songs, since people preferred more modern music. Adoru, an ecumenical worship book co-edited with the catholic association IKUE, containing texts, prayers and hymnals appeared in June 2001. After the war, KELI started to organize an annual conference with concerns about working out a program about work, study, entertainment, the conference country and local churches. More and more, because of good communication with IKUE, the Roman Catholic Esperanto-Union, the annual conferences happened together, for the first time in 1968 in Limburg/Lahn. They attracted between 90 and 200 people, many of which were IKUE or KELI members. At Universal Congresses, IKUE and KELI try to have communion together if possible. Often, they are among the great number of visited programs of the congress week. From the start, KELI supported the actions for the blind by the Dutchman, Jacques Tuinder, known under the name Agado E3, or now E-vid-ente. Now, its help focuses on Albania, but does not forget other aspects of misery for people with poor sight. The task of KELI goes in two directions: to inform the Church and other Christian groups about Esperanto, and to inform the Esperanto community about Christianity.

The conodonts themselves, however, are thought to be related to the vertebrates. It is now thought that protoconodont elements (e.g., Protohertzina anabarica Missarzhevsky, 1973), are probably grasping spines of chaetognaths rather than the oropharangeal elements of conodonts. Previously chaetognaths in the Early Cambrian were only suspected from these protoconodont elements (for example Phakelodus), but the more recent discoveries of body fossils have confirmed their presence then.

With different melodies, it became a Christian hymn of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied (NGL), appearing in current German hymnals, usually sung for baptism. The full title is \\"Segne dieses Kind und hilf uns, ihm zu helfen\\" (Bless this child and help us to help him), which is the beginning of all six stanzas. The first five stanzas follow the same pattern: a group of people feeling responsible for a child express that they request blessing for the child, and blessing for themselves, helping them to help the child to learn. It should learn to see, to hear, to reach out, to speak, to walk, to love. In five stanzas, the ability is further described by poetic images, for example \\"to see\\": the mother's face, the colours of the flowers, the snow on the mountains, the country of promise. Verhei√üung (promise) is the last word in all five stanzas. The last stanza is shorter, ending the poem on \\"learn to love with his whole heart\\" (\\"dass es lieben lernt mit seinem ganzen Herzen\\"). The text was written in 1971. It was included in the Catholic German hymnal Gotteslob (GL) with a melody by Erna Woll (former GL 636). It was also printed in 1981 in the collection Lieder vom neuen Leben (Songs of new life). A different melody by Michael Sch√ºtz, composed in 1983, appears in current German hymnals, both in the new Gotteslob (GL 490), as in Protestant hymnals.

(1 June 1805David St Leger Kelly, 'H√ºbbe, Ulrich (1805‚Äì1892)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hubbe-ulrich-3808/text6041, published first in hardcopy 1972, accessed online 15 July 2016. ‚Äì 9 February 1892) was a German immigrant to South Australia, remembered for his part in framing the Real Property Act, which led to the Torrens title system of land registration. History Dr. H√ºbbe was born in Hamburg in 1805, the third son of Heinrich H√ºbbe (1771‚Äì1847), and was educated at the Johanneum Gymnasium before studying law at Jena, Berlin, and the University of Kiel (then in Denmark), where he was awarded his LL.D. He arrived in South Australia aboard the Taglioni, 350 tons, from London in October 1842, and for a time worked for the South Australian Register before being involved as a land agent. The system of land title deeds which existed from the foundation of South Australia, as inherited from the Britain, was complex, open to abuse and disliked by both land agents and landowners, and seemed to have few supporters apart from traditionalists and lawyers. Suggestions for centralized registration of property were made in the earliest days after Proclamation by such as James Hurtle Fisher. Dr. H√ºbbe, who had personal experience with both the German system and the British, was one among many who wrote to the papers suggesting reform, but it was not until R. R. Torrens submitted his \\"Real Property Act\\" to the House of Assembly that any substantial effort towards reform was made. H√ºbbe, who was away from Adelaide around this time, returned in 1856 to find Torrens's campaign in full swing, and wrote, as \\"Sincerus\\", to The Register supporting the Act and making light of the difficulties in its implementation. Torrens, who was under siege from some powerful interests, sought out H√ºbbe as an ally, no doubt with an eye to enlisting the support of the equally powerful German community. In support of Torrens's campaign, H√ºbbe wrote a booklet The Voice of Reason and History on Conveyancing, drawing on his knowledge of European law, particularly that inherited from Hanseatic League States, but also of France. The cost of printing and publishing was met by G. F. Angas. Responding to commentators who claimed he was the unacknowledged father of the Real Property Act, H√ºbbe wrote: > ... I modestly disclaim as a matter of fact the honour of having originated > that Act, ... (although) I drew attention to the very objectionable features > of the English mode of conveyancing, and to the honest, unsophisticated mode > of transfer practised in Germany. ... The facts pointed out and the ideas > thus kindled in the minds of clear-sighted, practical men, who were > afterwards seen in the front rank of the contest, were no doubt farther > circulated, ...

Bellacci was a butcher and became a religious after turning his life around from one of sin to one of penance and servitude to God. Bellacci travelled across the Middle East and the Italian peninsula to preach and administer to people despite not being an ordained priest. The rite of beatification was celebrated in 1771. Life Tommaso Bellacci was born in Florence in 1370 in the neighborhood of the Ponte alle Grazie. His parents came from Castello di Linari in Val d'Elsa.; his father was a butcher. He got into a good deal of trouble on various occasions during his youth, and led such a wild and dissolute life as an adolescent that parents warned their sons to keep their distance from him. Persuaded by a friend to change his ways, he tried to enter some religious order but found strong resistance to being accepted. He became a butcher like his father. Bellacci was accused of having committed a serious crime in 1400 that he in fact did not do and so he wandered the streets of Florence until he met a priest who listened to Bellacci and took him in and helped clear his name. The incident shocked him so much - coupled with his appreciation of the priest - that he shed his life of sin and decided to live a life of total penance and service to God. He joined the Third Order of Saint Francis in Fiesole under the spiritual guidance of Friar Giovanni da Stronconio. He entered as a lay brother and became noted for keeping vigils and fasting. Bellacci was very particular in keeping to a literal interpretation of the Franciscan Rule. As novice master, despite not being a priest, he led by example. He became part of the Observant reform and in 1414 accompanied another friar to Naples to introduce the Observant practice in the Franciscan houses there. He remained in Naples six years, preaching and helping to spread the reform.Cerulli, Enrico. Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani , Vol. 7, (1970) He founded friaries in Corscia Pope Martin V called him to preach in the northern cities against the \\"Fraticelli\\" who were a group of heretical Franciscans and was also made Vicar General at the pope's behest; he and Albert Berdini of Sarteano in 1438 were later sent to the Middle East to cities such as Damascus and Cairo in order to promote the reunification of the Eastern and Western Churches when he was over 70. Alberto had to leave due for back home due to his ill health which left Bellacci on his own. He attempted to travel to Ethiopia but the Turks captured him three times. The Florentine merchants helped to secure his release the first two times. The third time he was again captured and suffered enslavement and persecution for several years.Rogers, Francis M. The Quest for Eastern Christians, University of Minnesota Press, 1962, p. 40 Pope Eugene IV helped secure his release. He returned home in 1444 and spent his time in a convent in Abruzzo until 1446. He was known for his diet of water and vegetables. Bellacci died in Rieti while on a visit to Rome to visit the pontiff. He planned to ask him for permission to return to the Orient. His remains were relocated in 2006. Beatification Bellacci was beatified by Pope Clement XIV in 1771.

Inspired by the Big Mac Index, the key difference between the two indices is that the KFC Index focuses solely on Africa; the Big Mac Index coverage is worldwide but not as applicable to Africa since McDonald's has little presence there, whereas KFC chains operate in almost 20 countries across the continent.  Overview  The KFC index was created by Sagaci Research (a Pan-African primary market research firm) as an informal way to gauge whether currencies in African countries are ‚Äúcorrectly valued‚Äù. It is based on the theory of purchasing power parity, which states exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalize the prices of an identical basket of goods and services between two countries. In this case, the concerned goods are KFC¬¥s Original 12/15 piece Bucket and geographically specific to African countries. The KFC Index also covers the United States, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. For example, the average price of KFC¬¥s Original 12 pc. Bucket in United States in January 2016 was $20.50; in Namibia it was only $13.40 at market exchange rates. Therefore, the index suggests that the Namibian dollar was undervalued by 33% at that time.  Inspiration  The index takes its name from the international fast food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and is modeled on The Economist¬¥s ‚ÄúBig Mac Index‚Äù, which covers countries with McDonald's presence (about 60 countries). In Africa, the McDonald's chain is only present in Morocco, South Africa and Egypt. KFC, on the other hand, has operations in almost 20 African countries, which is the highest of any international fast food chain and therefore a more applicable benchmark to use. The index was not intended as a precise gauge of currency misalignment but merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more digestible.  Limitations  As in the case of the Big Mac Index, the KFC Index was not created to be a highly accurate and precise tool for measuring purchasing power parity and its limitations include factors such as inflation, dietary preferences, socio-economic classifications, levels of competition and local costs (e.g. advertising, production and taxes). Currency volatility ‚Äì due to the nature of developing economies (in this case all countries in Africa), there is more likely to be high volatility in currencies, therefore undertaking this analysis over a one to three month basis could produce large changes and different conclusions. Black market ‚Äì as there is a thriving market for US Dollars in some countries, it may produce conflicting results compared to the official exchange rate. Angola and Nigeria are examples of these types of markets. The report produced by Sagaci Research takes into account black market exchange rates.

The team makes its entrance in football upgraded in 1931 when it won its first championship of Seconda Divisione (the third level of the football pyramid era) and achieves promotion to the Prima Divisione. Pinerolo remained in the league until 1935 when Prima Divisione is regionally reformed: only one season remained at this level as it got promotion to Serie C in 1936: here Pinerolo remained for five seasons. In 1941 did not submit to play in Serie C, but after the Second World War it was admitted to the league which was greatly enlarged compared to previous seasons. In 1948 relegated to Promozione and the following year in Prima Divisione: it had to wait until 1956 to get promotion to IV Serie. But in 1956 Pinerolo suffered a new relegation and played again in Prima Divisione where it remained for four seasons before getting promotion in Serie D. In 1966 relegated again in the Pima Divisione and waited until 1979 to play back in Serie D: it remains at this level until 1998 (except for the 1991-1992 season).

He earned his nickname \\"Rocket\\" from his speed in Gladiator competition, taking it as his gladiator name, becoming a Gladiator for season 2 of the rebooted American Gladiators. He has since appeared prominently in the Ninja Warrior franchise; in American Ninja Warrior (and hence US TV specials for Sasuke called \\"Ninja Warrior\\") and the standalone American Ninja Warrior, also using his nickname. Dollard also hosts his own web series, \\"Ninja Quickies\\". He has also competed in local editions of Ninja Warrior. Biography Before coming to fame, Dollard worked as a youth instructor, and taught rock climbing. Dollard was a childhood fan of the original American Gladiators (AG), he discovered that AG had been rebooted through his roommate finding the audition request on the internet. After discovering that AG was making a comeback, decided to try out for season 1 of the new show. He eventually became season 1 men's champion, and went on to be optioned for being a Gladiator for season 2, as \\"Rocket\\". Dollard discovered that AG had been canceled when an AG coworker mentioned that set equipment had been sold off, he had not been contacted by producers about the fate of season 3. Dollard found out about American Ninja Warrior (ANW) through co-worker computer programmers, who showed him YouTube videos of SASUKE and American Ninja Challenge, and suggested he try. Dollard contacted G4 TV to apply for a spot on American Ninja Warrior, and submitted a tape of his performances on American Gladiators as his audition tape. He was selected, and on ANW season 2, made it through and obtained a trip to Japan to Mount Midoriyama. Dollard was part of ANW for G4 in season 5 by being host of Well Trained Warrior web series web extras to ANW. The series interviewed ANW competitors at CrossFit Beach, and showed their training. Dollard became involved in A. Smith & Co.'s mid-2010s attempt to restart AG, which was not picked up by any network. With that show's failure to launch, Dollard started \\"Ninja Quickies\\" on YouTube. Ninja Quickies is and expansion on the premise of earlier series \\"Well Trained Warrior\\", interviewing ANW competitors on their own training grounds.

Bilateral vocal fold paralysis is basically a result of abnormal nerve input to the laryngeal muscles, resulting in weak or total loss of movement of the laryngeal muscles. Most commonly associated nerve is the vagus nerve (10th cranial nerve) or in some cases its distal branch, the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Paralysis of the vocal fold may also result from mechanical breakdown of the cricoarytenoid joint.Author: Joel A Ernster, MD, Chief Editor: Arlen D Meyers, MD, MBA http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/863885-overview#a11 It was first described in by Kashima in 1989. Medical uses Bilateral abductor paralysis of the vocal folds being the main indication, Kashima operation is also done to treat vocal cord malignancies and dysplastic lesions of vocal cords.Author: B Viswanatha, DO, MBBS, PhD, MS, FACS, Chief Editor: Arlen D Meyers, MD, MBA http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1891197-overview This surgical management is usually undertaken with a target of decannulation in tracheotomy-dependent patients.Brigger MT, Hartnick CJ. Surgery for pediatric vocal cord paralysis: a meta-analysis. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2002 Apr. 126(4):349-55. [Medline]. =Advantages= The procedure being short and easy to perform makes it the treatment of choice for management of the same.Lagier A, Nicollas R, Sanjuan M, Benoit L, Triglia JM. Laser cordotomy for the treatment of bilateral vocal cord paralysis in infants. Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2009 Jan. 73(1):9-13. [Medline]. Due to minimal invasiveness during the procedure, the time of anesthesia is reduced and good functional results such as swallowing and good voice quality can be obtained. The main objective of the procedure being enlarging the airway, it has become an alternative to tracheotomy, as here the airway is enlarged by making a wedge shaped resection in the posterior vocal cord and retracting the tissue after freeing the vocal ligament and the vocal muscle from the vocal processes. Contraindications Kashima Operation should be avoided in cases when a tumour is diffused throughout the thyroid cartilage, because operating in such cases may damage the tumour which may lead to its metastasis. The procedure should be avoided in patients with history of bradycardia, aneurysms or recent infarcts where general anesthesia may become a threat to patient‚Äôs life. In patients with fractured cervical spine it is not possible to perform this laser surgery because proper positioning of the patient would not be possible. Similarly in cases of severe ankylosing spondylitis, due to complete fusion and rigidity of the spine, movements are not possible which again hampers the proper positioning of the patient.Kleinsasser O. Microlaryngoscopy and endolaryngeal microsurgery. First India edition. New Delhi: JP Medical Ltd; 1995. 17-30. Complications Circulatory and respiratory disorders may arise due to general anesthesia. Injury to teeth, laceration of palate, hematoma and laceration of tongue or lips may occur during introduction of the laryngoscopes.Mendelsohn AH, Xuan Y, Zhang Z. Voice outcomes following laser cordectomy for early glottic cancer: a physical model investigation. Laryngoscope. 2014 Aug. 124(8):1882-6. [Medline]. During the cordotomy, larynx might get injured and bleeding can occur. As a normal body response to any injury, Granuloma and scar formation may take place. Post operative edema might occur as the surrounding structures are also slightly affected during the procedure.Hazarika P, Nayak DR, Balakrishnan R, Raj G, Pujary K, Mallick SA. KTP-532 laser cordotomy for bilateral abductor paralysis. Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2002. 54(3):216-20.  Procedure  The image is showing cordotomy incision(grey dotted line) on the posterior part of the right vocal cord. Surgery is performed under the effect of general anesthesia. The correct position of the patient is mandatory for the ideal introduction of laryngoscope. Preferably the patient should lie flat on the operating table without any head ring or sand bag beneath the shoulders. Before introduction of the laryngoscope, dental plate should be put in place. After tracheotomy, with a laser-safe endotracheal tube the patient is intubated with an ample exposition of the glottis. A small laser-protected endotracheal tube is placed in case there is no pre-existing tracheotomy.Eckel HE, Perretti G, Remacle M, Werner J. Endoscopic Approach. Remacle M, Eckel HE. Surgery of larynx and trachea. Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag; 2010. 107-214. A modification to this technique is made by using endoscopic CO2 laser posterior cordotomy without tracheotomy to not compromise respiration by minimising the postoperative edema.Segas J, Stavroulakis P, Manolopoulos L, Yiotakis J, Adamopoulos G. Management of bilateral vocal fold paralysis: experience at the University of Athens. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2001 Jan. 124(1):68-71. [Medline]. This modified procedure involves a judicious excision of 3.5‚Äì4 mm C-shaped wedge in posterior vocal cord from the open edge of the membranous cord using carbon dioxide laser. Excision is made anteriorly to the vocal process, continuing 4 mm laterally on to the ventricular band without exposing the cartilage. A 6‚Äì7 mm transverse opening is created at the posterior larynx by the surgical resection.Oswal VH, Gandhi SS. Endoscopic laser management of bilateral abductor palsy. Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2009. 61:47‚Äì51. To avoid unwanted effects of general anesthesia and prevent any infection during the operation, antibiotics, steroids, and H2 blockers are administered intraoperatively.Benninger MS, Bhattacharya N, Fried MP. Surgical management of bilateral vocal fold paralysis. Operative Techniques in Otolaryngology‚ÄìHead and Neck Surgery. 1998. 9:224-9. = Technique = The image is showing the result of cordotomy incision on the posterior part of right vocal cord. The procedure begins with orotracheal intubation using a laser-safe endotracheal tube. The eyes of the patient are padded and taped followed by draping of the head and application of upper tooth guard.Hogikyan ND, Batisan RW. Surgical therapy of glottic and subglottic tumors. Thawley SE, Panje WR, Batsakis JG, Lindberg RD. Comprehensive management of head and neck tumors. 2. Philadelphia: WB Saunders Company; 1039-68. When the patient is anesthetized sufficiently and full relaxation is seen. The largest feasible laryngoscope is introduced, to obtain a good view of the larynx. After positioning of the laryngoscope, it is fixed in place with the help of the chest holder. The light carrier is withdrawn after the adjustment of scope in desired position and then the operating microscope is introduced. The head and face of the patient is protected with moist towels. Then the operating microscope fitted with 400 mm lens and a microspot CO2 laser is brought in position. The endotracheal tube cuff is protected by a moist cottonoid sponge placed in subglottis. The site for the cordotomy is determined at the preoperative examination. If any one of the vocal fold seems to have a slightest degree of motion, then cordotomy is performed on the other one. Using CO2 laser with a spot size of 0.2 mm and power of 3-5 Watts, a cordotomy is performed 1-2mm anteriorly to the vocal process. This is then carried laterally to the thyroid lamina through the width of the vocal ligament and vocalis muscle. The cordotomy provides access to the arytenoid cartilage as well as opens the airway posteriorly. =Postoperative Care= After the operation, the patient is slightly immunocompromised, so to avoid infection by opportunistic organisms, oral antibiotic therapy is given for 1 week. Anti -gastroesophageal reflux treatment is given for 8 weeks to avoid the gag reflex occurring due to post operative edema. The patient should be advised to take absolute voice rest by avoiding coughing, singing and clearing of the throat. Coughing can be treated with cough suppressing and mucolytic agents. Inhalation of steam is advised twice daily. Follow-up endoscopy with flexible endoscopes is performed 3 days after the procedure, to clean up the fibrous residues. Once the mucosal healing is complete, the patients with tracheotomy can be decannulated within 6 weeks of the procedure.

Types There are four different types of thyroplasty procedures described by Isshiki: * Type 1 thyroplasty ‚Äì Medialization of the vocal folds (most common surgery for unilateral vocal cord paralysis). * Type 2 thyroplasty ‚Äì Lateralization of the vocal folds (in case of airway insufficiency after Laryngeal trauma). * Type 3 thyroplasty ‚Äì Shortening of the vocal folds (done to lower the vocal pitch). * Type 4 thyroplasty ‚Äì Lengthening of the vocal folds (done to raise the vocal pitch). Type 1 thyroplasty (medialization thyroplasty) It is the most commonly used surgical procedure to correct unilateral vocal cord paralysis (a condition where the vocal cord of one side is paralysed).The diagram (a), (b), (c) show different positions of vocal cords in different conditions. =Procedure= In this type of thyroplasty, a rectangular portion of the thyroid cartilage is mobilized and pushed towards the medial side using a piece of silastic block of proper shape under local anesthesia. Earlier, the piece of the thyroid cartilage was kept along with implant and the stitches were taken, but nowadays, the piece of the thyroid cartilage is cut and removed to avoid complications.A piece of thyroid cartilage is cut and pushed towards the medial side by placing an implant. Types of procedures Currently, there are four types of implant procedures which are used to perform type 1 thyroplasty. ;Montgomery Thyroplasty Implant system: This system was discovered after years of research and the main advantage of this implant system is that it eliminates the process of customizing the implant at the time of surgery. This system consists of different sizes and shapes of shims made of silastic. It has the most proven success rate and the duration of the procedure is slow in comparison to other implant system. The other advantage is that it does not require suturing. It has reduced incidence of trauma.In this type of implant system, the thyroid cartilage is pushed towards the medial side using the silastic implant. ;VoCoM system (vocal fold medialization): This system consists of different sizes and shapes of implants made from hydroxyapatite (a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite). It helps in achieving accurate vocal fold medialization. This procedure is technically reversible. But it should be used in candidates of permanent implantation due to its biocompatible clinical use lasting for nearly a decade. ;TVFMI system: This system generally consists of two sizes of implants made out of pure titanium. It has a lot of advantages and the main one is that it reduces the operative time. Titanium is more safe than other implants. It has great biocompatibility. The implants are available in only two variants and they are designed in such a way that they ensure optimal fixation. The implant can be easily made as the titanium sheet is easy to shape. The technique is relatively simple and does not require expensive instruments. ;Gore-Tex Implant system: In this type of implant system, the implant is made of homopolymer of polytetrafluoroethylene in form of minute beads arranged in a fine fiber mesh. It is malleable and can be inserted through a small window. =Indications= * Unilateral vocal cord paralysis where one vocal cord out of the two is paralysed. * Symptomatic glottic insufficiency (dysphonia, aspiration) which leads to incomplete glottic closure which in turn results in failure to produce proper sound. * Age-related vocal fold atrophy leading to glottic insufficiency. =Contraindications= * Malignant diseases of the endolaryngeal mucosa. * Previous history of radiation therapy to the larynx for treatment of laryngeal and hypolaryngeal cancers. * Poor abduction of the contralateral vocal folds. =Complications= * Airway obstruction is the most common complication. * Implant migration or extrusion in cases where proper stitches are not taken. * Wound infection. * Penetration of the endolaryngeal mucosa. * Incomplete glottal closure in 10‚Äì15% of patients. =Advantages= * The most important advantage is that this procedure is reversible. * It is long-lasting. * It can be performed with minimal anesthesia. * No discomfort to the patient. =Disadvantages= * It is an open procedure. * It is technically more difficult. * There may be limited closure of the posterior glottis. =Limitations= * There is increase in average phonation time (from 4.6 seconds to 15 seconds). * It provides static change to the laryngeal framework but does not have any effect on the dynamic function. Type 2 thyroplasty (lateralization thyroplasty) It is a surgical procedure used in conditions like adductor spasmodic dysphonia (a condition in which there is distortion of the voice due to excessively tight closure of the glottis on phonation). Generally, lateralization thyroplasty is intended to prevent this tight closure of the glottis at the terminal stage of phonation by lateralizing the position of the vocal cord. This is a completely mechanical process. =Procedure= An incision is made at midline of the thyroid cartilage. A silicon wedge is used to fix the incised thyroid cartilage in the newly abducted position. Modified technique A specially devised titanium bridge is used instead of silicon wedge. Nowadays, instead of one titanium bridge, two titanium bridges are used for permanent fixation of the thyroid cartilage. =Indications= * The only known indication for type 2 thyroplasty is adductor spasmodic dysphonia, a condition characterized by involuntary movements of muscles of the larynx during speech. =Contraindications= * It is contraindicated in irradiated larynx (when the larynx is exposed to radiation). Type 3 thyroplasty (relaxation thyroplasty) This procedure is generally done to lower the vocal pitch by shortening the thyroid ala. =Procedure= In this thyroplasty, the relaxation of the vocal cords is done by antero-posterior shortening of the thyroid ala. =Indications= * It is most commonly indicated in males with high-pitch voices (puberophonia) and those who are resistant to voice therapy. * In people with spasmodic dysphonia. * In people who have stiff vocal folds with high-pitched breathy voices. Type 4 thyroplasty (stretching thyroplasty) =Procedure= This procedure is done to elevate the vocal pitch. This procedure consists of lengthening of the thyroid cartilage. It includes cricothyroid approximation. =Indications= * It is done in people with bow-shaped vocal folds. * Androphonia (condition characterized by low vocal pitch). * Gender dysphonia, linked to gender dysphoria. Combination In some specific conditions, different types of thyroplasties are combined for the desired results. =Medialization thyroplasty with arytenoid adduction (rotation technique)= Purpose The main purpose of this combination is the medialization of the entire vocal cord (anterior and posterior). Indications * Open posterior glottis. * In people with high vagal paralysis. * Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis with lateralized arytenoid. * Non-rotating aarytenoid. =Medialization thyroplasty with arytenoid adduction (fixation technique)= Purpose * Medial vocal cord fixation. Indications * Arytenoid fracture where there is anterior dislocation of the arytenoid cartilage. * In cricoarytenoid joint ankylosis where there is failed arytenoid adduction. =Medialization thyroplasty (type 1) with stretching thyroplasty (type 4)= Purpose * The main purpose of this combination is stretching of the vocal cord with medialization of the affected side. Indications * Unilateral superior laryngeal nerve weakness. =Medialization thyroplasty (type 1) with relaxation thyroplasty (type 3)= Purpose * The main aim of this combination is relaxation and increased mass of one vocal cord. Indications * In males with high-pitched, presbyphonic voice. =Bilateral medialization thyroplasty= Purpose * Medialization of both the vocal cords. Indications * Open anterior glottis. * In presbyphonia where there is bilateral vocal cord weakness. * When there is bilateral loss of muscle mass. * Tremor-induced abductor spasmodic dysphonia (AbSD). =Bilateral relaxation thyroplasty= Purpose * Relaxation of both the vocal cords. Indications * In males who have an overly high-pitched voice. * Stable abductor spasmodic dysphonia (AbSD) References Otorhinolaryngology ","title":"Thyroplasty"},{"id":"51078146","text":"Castanopsis evansii is a tree in the family Fagaceae.

He then specialized in human rights (SOS Racisme, Chinese opponents, genocide in Rwanda, Augusto Pinochet; protesters, partisans of social struggle or far left militants.

Considering that \\"originally absolute, the immunity of heads of state has, since the end of the Second World War, had limits,\\" William Bourdon declared in an interview with Lib√©ration that the arr√™t might create \\"confusion\\", since only three crimes have universally justified lifting presidential immunity: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes: \\"Terrorism is a very subjective crime. If one reasons in this manner, Yasser Arafat could be pursued,\\" observed Ma√Ætre Bourdon, underlining that terrorism and narcotics trafficking were deliberately omitted when the International Criminal Court (ICC) was created. In keeping with this point, the parquet g√©n√©ral asked the Court of Cassation to pronounce for the first time on the controversial question of the immunity of heads of state. This motion does not require suspending the current investigation.

The channels are available through Optus' Yes TV by Fetch IPTV platform, or through an Optus Decoder on the VAST Satellite Network, as well as through companion apps and the Optus Sport website. The network was launched after Optus outbid the incumbent Foxtel for the English Premier League television rights, and the 24/7 channel Optus Sport 1 rebroadcasts the IMG world feed. History In the beginning of Optus Television, Optus had used sports rights as a key differentiator between it and rival Foxtel.Optus Lines Up For Goal They carried C7 Sport on their subscription television network until March 2002, when Optus replaced them with Fox Sports (Australia), rebranded as 'Optus Sports' until October of that year. In 2009 Optus Television ceased to be offered to new subscribers and the service was eventually ceased.Seven and Optus dispute may end in Legal Channels In July 2010, Malaysian backed Fetch TV launched in Australia, available through Optus.New Fetch TV Box service: It's a game changer: Delimiter In 2015, new CEO Allen Lew, who had launched parent company Singtel's EPL coverage, laid out a three-year plan (2016‚Äì18) for Optus to transition from a Telecommunications provider to a multimedia company, as a 'content aggregator'.Optus unveils EPL App and Set Top BoxesOptus CEO goes OTT in network content battle Optus began trialling their own content delivery network in March 2015,Optus, Nokia Trial real time video delivery and in November 2015 it was announced Optus had purchased the rights for the English Premier League in Australia until the conclusion of the 2018/19 season.Optus snatches EPL rights from Fox Sports in Australia In March 2016 it was announced the channels would be available through Fetch TV from Optus (rebranded as 'Yes TV'), as well as through a dedicated app and website, with satellite coverage available for those without appropriate internet speeds or for commercial venues.Optus Unveils Plans for the EPL This announcement also included the fact that one match per round would be sub-licensed to a Free-to- Air channel. It was revealed by SBS that they had traded their FIFA World Cup licence for this sub-licence.SBS strike EPL deal with Optus: SBS Optus announced pricing for the EPL coverage in May, which was revised after being poorly received by customers, with new pricing, including a period of 'free' coverage, announced in June.Optus Customers to get EPL from 15 per month on selected plansOptus Offers the new EPL season for Free Optus also announced they had done a deal with the Nine Network to share the International Champions Cup rights, with Optus showing all games played outside of Australia. Nine would share the China leg and retain exclusive rights to the Australian matches.Optus secures rights to ICC This was the first live sport broadcast on the channels, with Manchester United playing Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai on 22 July 2016 as the first live event. Optus also added a friendly West Ham United pre-season match, and would later show their unsuccessful Europa League Qualifier against Astra Giurgiu.Optus to Deliver More Live and Exclusive Pre-Season Football Action =Initial Controversy= The news that Optus had secured the Premier League rights was not received well by existing supporters. Most were locked into plans with either Foxtel or other telecommunications providers, and were skeptical of how Australia's poor network infrastructure could handle 'live' broadcasts over IPTV. The first three rounds were mired with complaints on social media and in other media outlets.Optus EPL Fail Aussie Sports Fans Deserve Better Many fans were also unhappy that government broadcaster SBS had traded away their rights to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, albeit maintaining all Australian matches, select group stage games and the majority of the knockout stages. =Foxtel Response= Incumbent rights holder Fox Sports (Australia) reacted quickly to the news they had lost the rights, removing the $15/month add-on BeIN Sports pack, and adding the channels to the existing Sports package. Club TV channels for Chelsea FC, Liverpool FC and Manchester United were also added, as were agreements to show Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur games on delay. Foxtel claimed Optus had threatened legal action over the new 'free' channels, and so added a 1 cent per channel per year charge to each. =Growth= Optus began to gradually add regional football competitions featuring Australian national teams, the 2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup and the 2016 AFF U-19 Youth Championship. They also screened the semi finals and final of the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. In October 2016, Optus Sport 2 began broadcasting ads with the tagline: 'This summer is going to be big', announcing the launch of a 24/7 Cricket channel on the channel for November 1, 2016, running until 28 February 2017. This was an extension of the existing Optus agreement with Cricket Australia that saw all Optus customers eligible for a Cricket Australia Live Pass. The channel showed highlights and full match replays from ongoing matches, and original content such as '#Stumps', which had previously been available on the defunct Optus Cricket app. It also showed classic matches from the Cricket Australia archives. Live content was available by linking the Optus Sport mobile app with the Cricket Australia App, but no live cricket content was available on the linear Optus Sport 2 channel. Optus struggled to find further new sports to add to the service given that most major Australian sporting codes were signed to long-term broadcast contacts. They bid for exclusive rights to the A-League but balked at the added cost of technical and equipment fees. As of May 2017, CEO Allen Lew considered the rights acquisition and launch of Optus Sport a success, and hinted that further similar offerings may be added to the 'Yes TV' platform in the near future, although they would be 'non-sport related' and 'family oriented.' It was later revealed that Lew was discussing the launch of the National Geographic App. =2018 FIFA World Cup & Relinquishing rights to SBS= Optus Sport purchased exclusive broadcast rights to broadcast 39 live matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in a deal with the public broadcaster SBS, who were awarded the original broadcast rights by FIFA. The remaining 25 matches would be simultaneously broadcast live on Optus Sport and SBS. The first game of the tournament that was broadcast exclusively on Optus Sport, Egypt vs. Uruguay on 15 June 2018, was marred with technical difficulties including buffering issues and failed connections. The negative reception and continued broadcasting problems resulted in a temporary arrangement made between Optus and SBS to broadcast all games on 18 and 19 June throughout a 48-hour period on SBS. This arrangement with SBS was extended on 20 June 2018 to include all group stage games, with Optus additionally leaving their app and streaming services free for the duration of the World Cup and until 31 August 2018 while refunding all current paid subscriptions. On 28 June 2018, Optus subsequently extended this arrangement to include all remaining matches at the World Cup. Channels and content Optus Sport operates eleven multiplex channels: *Optus Sport 1 Optus Sport 1 is the main channel, which predominantly shows Premier League however also shows UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and internationals. It broadcasts the international feed produced by IMG. The 24/7 Premier League coverage was moved to Optus Sport 3 for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It also shows Scores on Sunday, a 90 minute show dedicated to the week in football both domestically and internationally, male and female. *Optus Sport 2 Optus Sport 2 is the first overflow channel, and also shows selected international fixtures. During the 2018 FIFA World Cup, it was a secondary dedicated channel for the event, showing simultaneous live matches, replays, and highlights. *Optus Sport 3‚Äì6 Channels 3-6 are the remaining overflow channels and broadcast simultaneous live events of the Premier League or other competitions shown on Optus Sport.

He lives and works in Antwerp (Belgium). Biography and works Leon Vranken's work is radical in its simplicity and pays tremendous attention to material and finish, expressing both tension and calm. He interweaves expectation with technical expertise. With a background in landscape architecture, after his artistic education in Situ at the Royal Academy in Antwerp, he has devoted his energies to the visual arts. His diverse works‚Äì sculptures, installations, photos or interventions ‚Äì are mainly developed in interaction with space. Vranken completed his education at the Higher Institute for Fine Arts in Ghent in 2007, and has had international exhibitions in cities including New York, Londen and Toronto. Leon Vranken is always able to disrupt direct visual recognisability by depriving everyday objects of their function and deliberately using various materials. One could describe his work as sculptural trompe l'oeils, alluring yet misleading configurations. Geometric ensembles, sophisticated sculptures and fake ready-mades are painstakingly orchestrated in space. Shape, presentation and meaning slide continuously over each other like tectonic plates. With his spatial compositions the artist defies gravity, the viewer and the medium. The image enters into dialogue with the frame, the sculpture with the pedestal.

Her debut project Ode To The Dark was recorded with the team behind Italian gothic metal band Lacuna Coil's 2016 album Delirium and released to underground critical acclaim on October 13, 2018. She has garnered attention among the heavy metal music community for her piano cover version of American heavy metal band W.A.S.P.'s song \\"Sleeping (In The Fire)\\" on YouTube and acoustic 2015 LP Metal Lullabies. She has toured internationally and appeared on the Full Metal Cruise II presented by Wacken. Early life Melissa VanFleet was born February 8, 1986 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. She sang her first solo when she was in third grade and completed her first studio recording at the age of 12. As a child, she wrote poetry and lyrics as a form of therapy to help deal with complications of having a parent with a chronic illness. VanFleet is a self-taught vocalist and pianist. She is also a trained dancer in all styles. She has said that being a ballerina instilled in her an appreciation for classical music and cites Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake as a major influence. Career VanFleet recorded a piano cover version of American heavy metal band W.A.S.P.'s ballad \\"Sleeping (In The Fire)\\" in 2012. She originally recorded the cover as a birthday present for her dad and then posted the video on YouTube. VanFleet has received acclaim from present and past members of W.A.S.P., including co- founder and original guitarist Randy Piper and present lead guitarist Doug Blair. In 2013 and 2014, VanFleet performed at various venues including Musikfest in her hometown of Bethlehem, House of Vans in Brooklyn, New York, Webster Hall, The Cutting Room and had several long-term residencies at Hard Rock Cafe Philadelphia. She began working with booking and management company Noisegate Productions, based in Germany. She debuted as the vocalist of dark alternative duo COPP√âLIA at the Trocadero Theatre in September 2014. In April 2015, VanFleet went on tour in Spain.

Her acoustic LP Metal Lullabies was released on August 19, 2015. She performed at Musikfest in August 2015 to promote the album release and was named #1 of \\"7 Stellar Acts at Martin Guitar Lyrikplatz.\\" In 2016, VanFleet revealed to Ultimate Guitar that she was collaborating on a project with Scott Rockenfield of Queensr√øche and Nick Douglas of DORO. In February 2017, VanFleet recorded at BRX Studio in Milan, Italy with the team behind Italian gothic metal band Lacuna Coil's 2016 album Delirium ‚Äì producer/bassist Marco Coti Zelati with engineers Marco Barusso, Dario Valentini and Marco D'Agostino ‚Äì and her debut single \\"Raven,\\" featuring Doug Blair of W.A.S.P. on lead guitar, was released on October 13, 2017. A visual teaser trailer was published to YouTube on October 6, 2017 to promote the single. VanFleet recorded a live piano version of \\"Raven\\" as part of an exclusive for Rock Rebel Magazine in March 2018. In February 2018, VanFleet revealed plans of a forthcoming EP during an interview on the Emptyspiral podcast. On October 6, 2018, three promotional visual teaser trailers were published to YouTube and VanFleet released the project Ode To The Dark to underground critical acclaim on October 13, 2018. In May 2019, VanFleet was featured as a guest vocalist on a song titled \\"Nemesis\\" by Italian symphonic death metal band Genus Ordinis Dei. The single was released via Eclipse Records on May 24, 2019 and the music video debuted on May 28, 2019. In July 2019, VanFleet accompanied Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil on piano during an intimate acoustic segment of the band's two sold out shows at the Gramercy Theatre in New York. When asked about VanFleet's involvement during an interview with hardDrive Radio, Scabbia said, \\"It all started because Marco, our bass player, produced her record and that's when we met her in Milano. When we thought about a piano version of the songs and an acoustic part of the 119 Shows in New York, we immediately thought about her. We asked her and she was super excited because she has been a Lacuna Coil fan and we had a great time. We rehearsed for the first time the same day as the first show but everything went amazing.\\" Artistry VanFleet's sound has been described as atmospheric alternative metal with orchestral and gothic elements. She has said that she naturally gravitates toward dark themes and topics when writing songs. She suffers from anxiety and magical thinking obsessive-compulsive disorder and uses her mental health as inspiration for her lyrics. VanFleet's emotionally intense vocal delivery has been compared to the likes of Adele, Alanis Morissette and Amy Lee of Evanescence.

His essay Pro Futuro, in which he called for civil procedure reform, led to his appointment as an official with the Ministry of Justice, where he drafted the Austrian code of civil procedure, among several other laws. He helped strengthen the investigative authority and responsibility of the judge to the benefit of the weaker party, moving civil procedure towards a more inquisitorial system.

Pharaonism  Questions of Egyptian identity rose to prominence in Egypt in the 1920s and 1930s as Egyptians sought independence from British occupation. The Pharaonist movement, or Pharaonism, looks to Egypt's pre-Islamic past and argued that Egypt was part of a larger Mediterranean civilization. Many Coptic intellectuals hold to \\"Pharaonism,\\" which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic scholars in the early 20th century. Most scholars today see Pharaonism as a late development shaped primarily by western Orientalism, and doubt its validity..  Coptic identity Coptic identity as it stands now saw its roots in the 1950s with the rise of pan-Arabism under Nasser. Up to that point, Egyptian nationalism was the major form of expression for Egyptian identity,Haeri, Niloofar. Sacred language, Ordinary People: Dilemmas of Culture and Politics in Egypt. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. 2003, pp. 47, 136. Copts viewed themselves as only Copts without any Arab sentiment.Deighton, H. S. \\"The Arab Middle East and the Modern World\\", International Affairs, vol. xxii, no. 4 (October 1946), p. 519. The struggle to ascertain this Egyptian identity began as Nasser and his regime tried to impose an Arab identity on the country, and attempted to erase all references to Egypt as a separate and unique entity.  Ethnic flag (2005)  The flag of Egyptian nationalist revolutionaries during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. It displays both the Islamic Crescent representing Muslim Egyptians and the Christian cross representing Christian Egyptians. A Coptic flag was created in 2005 by a Coptic activist group called \\"The Free Copts\\" as an ethnic flag representing Copts, Coptic identity and as a sign of opposition to Islamic authority in Egypt. It is not recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church or the Coptic Catholic Church but has been adopted by the New Zealand Coptic Association. The Coptic Flag consists of two main components: a blue cross and a colorful coat of arms. * The cross represents Christianity, the Copts' religion. The blue color stems from the Egyptian sky and water. It also reminds the Copts of their persecution, when some of Muslim rulers forced their ancestors to wear heavy crosses around their necks until their necks became blue.My Coptic Church - Ask A CoptEl-Shamy, Hasan M. Folktales of Egypt. 406 p. 1980 Series: (FW) Folktales of the World () * The top of the coat of arms is decorated with Coptic crosses intertwined with lotus flowers, representing Egyptian identity. Coptic crosses are made of four arms equal in length, each of which is crossed by a shorter arm (similar to the heraldic cross crosslet fitchy or cross bottony). The lotus flower, also known as the Egyptian White Water-lily (Nymphaea lotus), has been a symbol of creation since Ancient Egyptian times. Remains of the flower were found in the burial tomb of Pharaoh Ramesses II. Hence, its use on the flag represents the desire of all Coptic people to overthrow the Arab Islamic government and restore a native monarchy. The black background behind the ornaments is a symbol of Kimi or Kemet, the Egyptian name of Egypt, which means the Black Land. Beneath these ornaments is a green line in the middle of the coat of arms, which represents the Nile Valley. Around it are two yellow lines that symbolize the Eastern and Western Deserts of Egypt. These two lines are in turn flanked by two blue lines that represent the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea that enclose Egypt. Finally, these lines are separated by red lines symbolizing Coptic blood, which has been shed all over Egypt since Copts adopted Christianity and until today.

Some critics characterize these British agreements as a form of bribery designed to facilitate colonization of the interior.

He married a French-Tunisian cousin, living in Nice, with whom he had three children. According to his wife's lawyer, he was repeatedly reported for domestic violence and the couple separated. The Times of India described Lahouaiej- Bouhlel as \\"mentally unstable\\", with a tumultuous personal life, which included drug use and consumption of violent online content. Police examination of his phone revealed what Sky News described as a \\"string\\" of relationships with both men and women, including an affair with a 73-year-old man. In the days before the attack, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel let his beard grow and told people \\"the meaning of this beard is religious.\\" French authorities stated that Lahouaiej-Bouhlel showed a passion for religion only recently; \\"Mohamed only started visiting a mosque in April,\\" a witness stated. French investigator Fran√ßois Mulins stated \\"Bouhlel had expressed support for the Islamic State.\\" Molins also found that from 1 July, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel made more or less daily Internet searches for verses of the Koran and \\"nasheeds\\". He also researched the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Investigators found photos of dead bodies and images linked to radical Islamism on his computer, including the flag of the Islamic State; the cover of an issue of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had been attacked by gunmen in January 2015; and photos of Osama bin Laden and Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar. He also told friends he did not understand why IS could not hold territory and showed them a video of a beheading on his mobile phone. In response to their shock, he said he was \\"used to it\\". In addition, he had searched the Internet for the terms \\"terrible mortal accidents\\", \\"horrible mortal accidents\\" and \\"shocking video, not for sensitive souls\\" and consulted news articles on fatal accidents, including on 1 January 2016 an article'Strategisch, nicht spontan'. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 22 July 2016. Retrieved 10 October 2016 or a photo from a local newspaper about a car incident with the caption: \\"He deliberately crashes onto the terrace of a restaurant\\". According to media reports, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was known to police for five prior criminal offenses, notably regarding armed violence. On 27 January 2016 he was put on probation for attacking a motorist with a wooden pallet after a traffic accident. He was convicted on 24 March 2016 and given a six-month suspended sentence on charges of violence with a weapon. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was last arrested less than a month before the attack after a traffic accident in which he had been asleep at the wheel, and he remained subject to judicial supervision. He was, however, not registered as a national security risk (fiche \\"S\\") with French authorities. Reports say that Lahouaiej-Bouhlel often visited Tunisia, saying the last time he did so was eight months prior to the attack. =Money transfer= Just days before the attack, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel sent ‚Ç¨97,000 ‚Äì ‚Ç¨100,000 to his family in Tunisia.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nice-terror-attack- killer-mohamed-lahouaiej-bouhlel-sent-84000-to-family-in-tunisia-days- before-a7141221.html Suspected affiliations The newspaper Nice-Matin published an interview with an eyewitness who recounted hearing \\"Allahu Akbar\\" (\\"God is greatest\\") during the attack from his balcony, with similar reports being circulated by other news organizations and on social media. Officials have not confirmed these reports, while the BBC has characterised the claim that this can be heard on a video as a false social media rumour. A French prosecutor claimed that the attack \\"bore the hallmarks of jihadist terrorism.\\" However, a preliminary investigation by French officials has not connected Lahouaiej-Bouhlel to any international terror groups. Amaq News Agency, an online presence said to be affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), called Lahouaiej-Bouhlel \\"one of the soldiers of Islamic State.\\" It cited a \\"security source\\" which said Lahouaiej-Bouhlel \\"carried out the operation in response to calls to target nationals of states that are part of the coalition fighting Islamic State\\". Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was not known by Tunisian authorities to have been involved in any terrorism activities on Tunisian soil. His name was not in the French database of suspected Islamic militants. According to a cousin of Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's wife, Lahouaiej- Bouhlel was not a religious person and did not attend a mosque. The Guardian noted that his lack of religious piety is typical for the French and Belgian subjects involved in terrorist rampages earlier in 2016. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls proclaimed that Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was \\"probably linked to radical Islam in one way or another\\", and put the attack in the context of a \\"war\\" against terrorism and \\"extremist\\" Islam both outside and within France. This allegation was initially cautioned by the French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who said \\"We have an individual who was not known to intelligence services for activities linked to radical Islam\\" and who could not confirm Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's motives were linked to radical jihadism. The next day, Cazeneuve said \\"It seems that he [Lahouaiej-Bouhlel] radicalized himself very quickly,\\" early investigations had found. Bouhlel's uncle, Sadok Bouhlel, stated his nephew was indoctrinated about two weeks prior to the attack by an Algerian member of the Islamic State group in Nice. According to authorities, Bouhlel watched many ISIS beheading videos and researched in depth Omar Mateen, perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting. After the attack, newspapers reported, on the authority of unspecified investigators, that evidence found on Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's cellphone showed he may have been in contact with individuals in his neighborhood, who were known to the French intelligence agencies as Islamic radicals. However, an intelligence source cautioned this \\"could just be a coincidence, given the neighbourhood where he lived. Everyone knows everyone there. He seems to have known people who knew Omar Diaby\\", a known local Islamist believed to be linked with Al-Nusra Front.  2016 attack in Nice and death  Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's mobile phone, discovered in the truck after he was shot by police, provided information to the police about his preparations. On 12 and 13 July 2016, Bouhlel returned several times to the Promenade des Anglais, the site of the attack, surveying the area in the rented truck. On 12 July, he took some selfies on the Promenade, as Molins confirmed on 18 July. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's brother said he received images of Lahouaiej-Bouhlel laughing among the holiday crowds in Nice hours before the attack. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was shot dead by French police officers who were attempting to force him to stop the truck. The French prosecutor said the attack \\"bore the hallmarks of jihadist terrorism\\" but that no group had claimed responsibility for the attack, and a preliminary investigation by French officials has not connected Lahouaiej-Bouhlel to any international terror groups. However, on 16 July 2016, the Amaq News Agency, called Lahouaiej-Bouhlel \\"a soldier of the Islamic State.\\" It cited an \\"insider source\\", which said Lahouaiej-Bouhlel \\"executed the operation in response to calls to target citizens of coalition nations, which fight the Islamic State\\". Later that same day, ISIL's official al-Bayan radio station said Lahouaiej-Bouhlel executed a \\"new, special operation using a truck\\" and \\"the crusader countries know that no matter how much they enforce their security measures and procedures, it will not stop the mujahideen from striking.\\" See also * List of Islamist terrorist attacks * List of rampage killers (religious, political or ethnic crimes) References 1985 births 2016 deaths 21st-century criminals Tunisian mass murderers Islamist mass murderers Tunisian murderers of children People from Sousse Governorate People shot dead by law enforcement officers in France Tunisian criminals Tunisian emigrants to France Tunisian Muslims Bisexual men LGBT Muslims ","title":"Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel"},{"id":"51078605","text":"St. Martin's Eve is a novel by Ellen Wood, first published in 1866. It takes its name from the festival of St. Martin's Day, held on November 11, the festivities for which in some countries commence on the previous evening; many of the critical events of the novel occur on this date over several years. The plot centres on the aftermath of George Carleton St. John's untimely death, after which his second wife Charlotte St. John (n√©e Norris) is granted care of his two children‚Äîone by his first marriage (and the heir to Alnwick), the other by theirs‚Äîbut severe doubts surround her appropriateness for the role. In France, the bachelor Frederick St. John seeks a reclusive existence in order to restore his finances; unexpectedly, he finds himself interposing in the engagement of Adeline de Castella to a French baron, with tragic consequences.  Synopsis  The story is told as a third-person narrative that begins with the birth of Benjamin ('Benja') St. John, the delivery of whom results in the death of his mother. Despite assertions that he will never remarry, her husband George Carleton St. John takes a new wife, Charlotte Norris. George dies shortly afterwards of an inherited, constitutional weakness ('the Alnwick curse'), after which Benja and their son, George ('Georgy'), are left to the care of Charlotte. Prompted by concerns that Charlotte's envy of Benja (who will inherit Alnwick in place of her son) might lead her to harm him, his relative Isaac St. John is left as a guardian to the child by a provision of the will. Later, Benja's nurse, Honour Tritton, grows increasingly alarmed by Charlotte's violent behaviour towards the child. In an attempt to soothe Benja, she builds him a toy made of paper and candles; left alone with the toy, and after the doors to the room are seemingly locked, the child is burned to death. Eventually judged to be an accident, nonetheless Charlotte is deeply disturbed by the event: she becomes prone to hallucinations about the child and the lighted toy, and decides to leave Alnwick with her son George. The bachelor Frederick St. John relocates to France as a means of restoring his precarious financial situation. There he finds himself infatuated with Adeline de Castella, who is already engaged to the Baron de la Chasse. Frederick is repeatedly rebuffed as he makes overtures to her family for them to be married instead and launches a failed attempt to elope to England. Finally, Adeline is made aware by her father that their marriage would be an affront to their Catholic faith (Frederick is Protestant), and is made to promise that she cannot tell Frederick this. Unable to sanction her behaviour, Frederick returns to England, but the turmoil of his departure takes its toll on Adeline; after a protracted illness, she dies of consumption. Her close companions, Rose Darling (Charlotte's sister) and Mary Carr, finally manage to contact Frederick and take him to see Adeline, whose body is preserved as part of its reception before the funeral. In the meantime, Charlotte's son George dies in Ypres, her household having been constantly on the move across Europe since the death of Benja; her own son never recovered from the shock of that night, and Charlotte experiences another hallucination during a procession of candles on St. Martin's Eve. Some time later, in England, Charlotte is lodged in the household of Isaac St. John. Frederick suspects her of hereditary madness and that she intends to marry Isaac in order to acquire his fortune; various incidents suggest to him that her jealousy of him might lead her to commit violence against the other women also there. Prance, Charlotte's close confidante, elicits the help of her mother after her behaviour grows increasingly erratic, but they cannot make her leave the house. Frederick's suspicions are confirmed when a physician is able to confirm that Charlotte's father died mad. After a manic episode leads Charlotte to be committed to a lunatic asylum, Prance voices her suspicions that it was Charlotte who locked the doors on the burning child, Benja.

Biography Born in 1919 in Bra, Piedmont, Curto obtained his degree in Roman archaeology in 1941. After the war, he became an inspector for the Soprintendenza alle Antichit√† Egizie and in 1964 he was appointed director of the Museo Egizio of Turin, a charge he held until 1984. During his term, the museum was renovated considerably and since 1969 it was provided with a large library. Between 1961 and 1969 Curto led the Italian team of archaeologists who took part in the international effort of relocating the Abu Simbel temples which were threatened by the building of the Aswan High Dam. Italy received as a gift the small temple of Ellesyia, originally built by Thutmose III for the god Horus, which was rebuilt by Curto in 1970 inside the Museo Egizio in Turin, where it still is. From 1964 to 1989 he taught Egyptology at the University of Turin. He also contributed to various Egyptian collections throughout Italy, such as renovating the one in the Museo Civico Archeologico of Bologna in 1961 and co- founding the Egyptian Museum of Milan in 1972. Curto died on September 24, 2015 in Turin, aged 96. In 2016, the director of the Museo Egizio Christian Greco named the museum's library after him in his honor.

Life Schiffer was born in Berlin. His father, Siegfried Schiffer (1849‚Äì1897), was a Jewish timber merchant who died when the boy was only 5. He passed his School final exams (Abitur) and went on to train with Emil Orl√≠k as an artist and illustrator. He was very soon forced to acknowledge that his true calling lay elsewhere, as a writer of satirical texts. During this part of his career he worked as a writer and illustrator, also producing poetry.. In the early 1920s Schiffer got to know Marguerite \\"Margo\\" Lion, the Constantinople-born French cabaret singer who had come to Berlin in order to study at the city's Russian ballet school. Motivated, some suggest, by morbid jealousy, Schiffer turned his own talents towards the world of cabaret. He developed in Berlin a genre of his own that combined literary revue with cabaret, working between 1922 and 1925 on the shows \\"Wilde B√ºhne\\", \\"Rampe\\", \\"T√ºt√º\\", \\"Gr√∂√üenwahn\\" and \\"Katakombe\\". In November 1923 MargoLion made her own performance debut with the song created by Schiffer \\"The Line of Fashion\\" (\\"Die Linie der Mode\\"). Some years later, in 1928, the two of them were married. Another defining collaboration involved the Russian-born composer Mischa Spoliansky who at this time as living in Berlin, and whom Schiffer first met in 1925. Together the two of them devised a new form of sharply humorous musical theatre that combined elements of cabaret and of revue. Their first major production, \\"Es liegt in der Luft\\" (\\"It's in the air\\") was an instant hit with German audiences. It can be seen as Germany's first musical, although the term was not used in Germany at this time, and the work was generally perceived as a revue. It was a stage breakthrough in other ways, too. Margo Lion starred alongside her younger friend, not yet famous, Marlene Dietrich. One of the highlights was the duet which the two sang together \\"Wenn die beste Freundin mit der besten Freundin\\". From now on Schiffer was much in demand as a writer of musical cupl√©s in Weimar Germany. Similarly fruitful was his relationship with the composer Paul Hindemith. This gave rise, in 1929, to the opera News of the day (\\"Neues vom Tage\\"). He had written the libretto of this short opera for Hindemith a couple of years earlier. Together with the collaborations highlighted above, Marcellus Schiffer also wrote libretti for Friedrich Hollaender, Rudolf Nelson, Werner Richard Heymann and Allan Gray. On 24 August 1932 Marcellus Schiffer, who seems to have suffered from depression, ended his life by taking an overdose of sleeping tablets.

It is an erect, bushy shrub with linear leaves and dense heads of white flowers in late spring and summer. Description Verticordia polytricha is a shrub with a single stem at its base but which is densely branched and bushy. It grows to a height of and wide. Its leaves are linear in shape, semi-circular or triangular in cross-section, long and those near the ends of the branches are crowded. The flowers are scented and arranged in dense, corymb-like groups near the ends of the branches, each flower on a stalk about long. The floral cup is hemispherical, long and hairy on the upper half. The sepals are creamish-white, about long and have a fringe of long hairs. The petals are the same colour as the sepals, spreading at first, erect later, long and hairy on the outside. The style is long, gently curved and hairy near the purple-coloured tip. Flowering time is from late September to February. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia polytricha was first formally described by George Bentham in 1859 from a specimen collected by Augustus Oldfield and the description was published in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (polytricha) is derived from the Ancient Greek words poly meaning \\"many\\" and thrix meaning \\"hair\\" referring to the hairs on the sepals. In his review of the genus in 1991, Alex George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Corymbiformis along with V. densiflora, V. brownii, V. eriocephala and V. capillaris.George, A.S.

It was the first of the group of CGRPR antagonists to be FDA approved in 2018. It is a form of monoclonal antibody therapy in which antibodies are used to block the receptors for the protein CGRP, thought to play a major role in starting migraines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.  Medical uses  Erenumab is indicated for the prevention of migraine in adults. It is administered by subcutaneous injection.  Side effects  Common side effects are constipation, pruritus, muscle spasms, as well as mild and mostly transient reactions at the injection site.  Interactions  Erenumab was shown not to interact with ethinyl estradiol, norgestimate or the migraine drug sumatriptan. It is expected to generally have a low potential for interactions because it is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.  Pharmacology  = Mechanism of action = Erenumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRPR). = Pharmacokinetics = After subcutaneous injection, the erenumab has an estimated bioavailability of 82%. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after four to six days. Like other proteins, the substance is degraded by proteolysis to small peptides and amino acids. It has an elimination half-life of 28 days.  History  = Development = Erenumab was developed by Amgen Inc in conjunction with Novartis. In the phase III STRIVE clinical trial 955 patients were divided into three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Each group was injected subcutaneously monthly with 0, 70 or 140 mg erenumab over a period of 6 months. The results were measured as mean monthly migraine days in months 4, 5, and 6. At baseline the patients experienced between 4 and 14 migraine days per month with an average of 8.3. The medication significantly reduced the number of migraine days per month by 3.2 in the 70-mg group and 3.7 in the 140-mg group, versus 1.8 in the placebo (0-mg) group.Erenumab to prevent migraine: results from phase III STRIBE\\", Pharma World, December 14, 2017. = Approval and marketing = The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the medication for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults on May 17, 2018. The list price was reported to be per year. It was approved for medical use in the European Union on July 26, 2018. In the United Kingdom, Erenumab was approved by the Scottish Medicines Consortium, but the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence rejected the drug on the basis that its cost-effectiveness was not sufficiently proven.

She is married to the 48th and current vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. She was formerly the First Lady of Indiana from January 14, 2013 to January 9, 2017. Early life and education Pence was born as Karen Sue Batten at McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas on January 1, 1957, the daughter of Lillian (n√©e Hacker; 1931‚Äì2004) and John M. Batten (1931/1932‚Äì1988), a United Airlines official. Her parents divorced when she was very young, and her mother married Bernard Barcio in 1967. She grew up in the Broad Ripple Village neighborhood of Indianapolis, where she graduated as valedictorian from Bishop Chatard High School. Pence attended nearby Butler University where she studied to become a teacher, and minored in art. She received both a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and a Master of Science (M.S.) in elementary education from Butler University. Career Pence has taught at John Strange Elementary, Acton Elementary, Fall Creek Elementary, and the Orchard School, all in Indianapolis. After the birth of her first child, Pence took a class in watercolor painting. This led to a career painting portraits of houses and historic buildings. She has completed as many as thirty-five paintings a year, some on commission and selling others at local art fairs. While Mike Pence was in Congress, Karen worked at Immanuel Christian School, a private Christian school in Springfield, Virginia, as an arts teacher for twelve years. First lady of Indiana Pence was the first lady of Indiana during her husband's term as governor of the state from 2013 to 2017. In her first year of the role, she established the Indiana First Lady's Charitable Foundation to \\"promote individuals and organizations that encourage children, families, and the arts\\", also offering grants and scholarships. While first lady in 2015, Pence started a small business named \\"'That's My Towel!' Charm\\" which makes metal charms for attaching to towels so they can be more easily identified when among others. The business was put on hold when Mike Pence became a vice presidential candidate. Second lady of the United States Pence's first official portrait Mike and Karen Pence with Gold Star Wives of America, April 2017 Pence became the second lady of the United States on January 20, 2017, succeeding Jill Biden. She hired Kristan King Nevins as her chief of staff; Nevins had served in the same position under former first lady Barbara Bush. As second lady, Pence intends to raise awareness of art therapy, to which she was first exposed when visiting a Washington hospital during her husband's tenure as a congressman. In October 2017, she visited the campus of Florida State University to highlight the university's art therapy program, which dates back to the 1990s. =2019 return to teaching= In January 2019, it was reported that Pence was returning as the arts teacher for Immanuel Christian School, said in a statement that she was \\"excited to be back in the classroom and doing what I love to do,\\" and that she had \\"missed teaching art.\\" The school had previously been criticized and accused of homophobia for not admitting LGBT students, posting a policy wherein it is permitted to turn away students who engage in, uphold, or accept \\"sexual immorality, homosexual activity, or bisexual activity\\", with the policy also applying to parents and employees. Pence was harshly criticized in the media and by LGBT advocates and advocacy organizations in the days following the announcement. Vice President Pence defended his wife's profession and decision, accusing her critics of attacking religious education. He said that he and his wife were \\"used to the criticism\\", but that he was angered over the criticism of his wife, opining that \\"to see major news organizations attacking Christian education is deeply offensive to us\\", and that it \\"should stop\\". Family and personal life While in high school, she met her first husband, John Steven Whitaker. They were married on August 4, 1978, in Brewster County, Texas, and later divorced. Whitaker was a medical student during their marriage. Karen met Mike Pence while she was playing guitar at Mass at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, a Catholic church in Indianapolis they both attended. Their first date included ice skating at the Indiana State Fairgrounds. After about nine months of dating, they became engaged in August 1984 and married on June 8, 1985. They were both Roman Catholic and later converted to evangelical Christianity by 1995. The couple has three children: Michael (serving in the U.S. Marine Corps), Charlotte, and Audrey. Pence has lived most of her life in Indiana, though the entire family moved to Washington, D.C. for the twelve years that husband Mike was a congressman from Indiana before his election as governor of Indiana. She is a trained pilot. Pence is known for her dedication to promoting art as a way of healing. She provided the watercolor illustrations for her daughter Charlotte's 2018 children's book, Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President, the proceeds from which are given to charities, including an art therapy program.

He participated in the Italo-Turkish War as Official of active service in Tripoli, in the siege of Ain Zara and in Cyrenaica. He was conscript in 1915 and -by intervening in the battles of the Isonzo- he was wounded in the Seventh Battle of the Isonzo: for this serious wound he was relegated to service distant from the front for some months, but soon wanted to go back to the battle front. Daodice was then promoted to major after the Battle of the solstice and the Battle of Vittorio Veneto in 1918. After the war, Daodice remained hostile to the Fascism becoming \\"military attach√©\\" in 1926 in Lisbon and later in Budapest from 1928 to 1931. In 1934 he was promoted to Colonel, fighting the Ethiopian War (First Battle of Tembien, Battle of Step Uarieu and Battle of Mai Ceu) as adjutant first to Badoglio and then to Rodolfo Graziani. During the war Daodice was the author of numerous deportations to concentration camps of members of the local population. With his successful victories, Daodice was awarded the Order of the Supreme Santissima Annunziata. Daodice was governor of Italian Eritrea from December 1937 to June 1940 and greatly improved the colony during his mandate. During his rule he promoted the architectural development of Italian Asmara, a city that was nicknamed Little Rome even because of him. He was also Governor of Addis Ababa from 1940 to 1941, in the Africa Orientale Italiana. In his governorship to Addis Ababa/Scioa Governorate (June 2, 1940) Daodice built numerous infrastructure to improve the social status; the charge was transferred to Agenore Frangipani in 1941. Daodice returned to Italy just before the British conquest of Ethiopia's capital, where he was promoted to Major General and was member of the Italian Parliament, retiring to private life and taking part in a few sessions in two years as \\"deputy\\". Daodice voted against Benito Mussolini after July 25, 1943 and as a consequence from Frosinone, where he then lived, was forced to flee to Caserta and from there to Brindisi, with the King Victor Emmanuel III and Badoglio in September 1943. After the war he was tried as fascist and for possible crimes perpetrated in Ethiopia: he was sentenced to fifteen years of forced labor, but he did only five. He died in Bergamo in December 1952.

Personal history and profile  Juzo Takaoka was born in Tokyo in 1921. His father was a traditional Japanese bookbinder. Never caring much about money, his father was always poor, as were most craftspersons in those days. He paid little attention to his son's education. After finishing elementary school, Takaoka was sent by his father to apprentice at a printing company. At the company, he was often treated badly by his seniors. They foisted on him all the things they did not want to do. During his second apprenticeship, he was again ill- treated by his seniors. They had him distribute types in the Latin alphabet to their type cases after printing. They could not read the alphabet, and the distribution of types was tedious for them. Takaoka could not read the alphabet either, but the task turned out to be a blessing in disguise. He soon realized the advantage of handling the Latin alphabet: it basically has only 26 characters whereas Japanese has thousands. Before he knew it, Takaoka was completely captivated by Western typefaces. In 1937, Takaoka read a short magazine article that would change his life. It was about the poor standard of Western typography in Japan and was written by Yoshimitsu Inouye (also known as Kazui Inoue), Takaoka's future teacher and mentor.‚ÄúWestern Letterpress in Japan: The printing of Juzo Takaoka,‚Äù Forum 27 (March 2014), Letter Exchange. Inouye, a lover of Western letterpress printing, worked in London between 1934 and 1939 as representative of major Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen. While overseas, he developed expertise in Western typography and acquired a small printing press and types, enough to become an amateur printer. In January 1937, Inouye contributed the article to Japan's leading printing magazine, Insatsu Zasshi. His article had a strong impact on Japanese progressive printers and compositors of the time, inspiring them to form the Study Group on Western Typography so that they could learn directly from Inouye. Takaoka joined this group and was its youngest member. On February 17, 1940, the Study Group held its first meeting.≈åbun katsuji [Latin types]. Tokyo: Uyu Shorin, 2010 (new format edition) [in Japanese].A special booklet commemorating Takaoka‚Äôs 90th birthday produced by Uyu Shorin, 2011 [in Japanese]. Enthralled by Inouye's lectures, Takaoka desperately wanted to become Inouye's apprentice. He persistently went to his home with work samples in hand to seek his permission. Though he was repeatedly turned away, Takaoka was finally accepted as Inouye's disciple in 1940 thanks to the mediation of Inouye's wife, Kimiko. He was the only member of the Study Group to be accepted as an apprentice.Inouye, Yoshimitsu, and Tar≈ç Shimo. R≈çmaji insatsu kenky≈´ [Roman alphabet print research]. Tokyo: Dai Nippon Insatsu ICC Honbu, 2000 (coauthor), 251 [in Japanese]. With high aspirations, Takaoka started going to the Kazui Press, Inouye's private press based at his home in Harajuku, Tokyo. Even after Takaoka had gone several times, though, Inouye spoke not a word about typography. Instead, he told Takaoka about English towns and people in London. One day Takaoka gently asked Inouye to give him practical instruction on typography. Inouye scolded Takaoka, saying, ‚ÄúThe instruction has already begun! Do you not see that? I am telling you about the people who will use the prints you make in Western typesetting. Without understanding their lifestyle and culture, you will not be able to meet their needs.‚Äù These words of Inouye shaped Takaoka's attitude toward letterpress work and typographic education. Under Inouye's tutelage, Takaoka mastered the principles and philosophy of Western typography and became an expert printer- typographer as well as a gentleman with social graces.Inouye, Yoshimitsu, and Tar≈ç Shimo. R≈çmaji insatsu kenky≈´ [Roman alphabet print research]. Tokyo: Dai Nippon Insatsu ICC Honbu, 2000 (coauthor), 252 [in Japanese]; an interview with Takaoka. During the apprenticeship period, Takaoka used to go to Maruzen, the most prestigious bookstore in Tokyo at that time, to look for books on Western typography, whenever he had spare time and a bit of cash. Sticking out among the properly dressed clients with his poor attire, he could not possibly have been seen as a good customer, but the head clerk of Maruzen appreciated Takaoka's genuine enthusiasm for Western typography and often kept books aside for him and even paid for some of them himself. In 1941, as World War II was spreading, Inouye and Takaoka were asked to cooperate in the production of Japan's war propaganda magazine Front by Tohosha,‚ÄúJapanese Propaganda: Front (1941-45),‚Äù Fans in a Flashbulb, accessed April 22, 2017, https://fansinaflashbulb.wordpress.com/2010/07/02/japanese-propaganda- front-1941-45/. a publisher under the direct control of the Imperial Japanese Army. Obviously inspired by the American magazine Life, Front was reputed for its excellence in design. The production team was composed of Japan's most talented people of the time, including Hiromu Hara and Ihei Kimura, who later became the nation's leading designer and photographer, respectively. The many Western typefaces that Inouye collected during his posting in London were stored at the Kazui Press, but all of them were destroyed during the war. Inouye decided to reconstruct his printing shop after the war ended, and he entrusted much of the project to Takaoka. Upon receiving this request from Inouye, Takaoka left his work at Hosokawa Printing Co., Ltd., in Ginza, Tokyo, and set to creating a new printing shop for Inouye. In 1948, with funding from Inouye, the Kazui Press was reopened in Kanda-Kajicho, Tokyo. Busy with his primary job at the shipping company, Inouye entrusted an increasing amount of work to Takaoka, and the Kazui Press began to accept more commercial printing work. Helped by Inouye's acquaintances as well as by large orders from GHQ, Takaoka's business flourished. A piece from Juzo Takaoka's letterpress work, Ars Typographica 1 Juzo Takaoka's business card set in the American Uncial typeface In 1956, when Inouye died, Takaoka took over the printing shop and made it into a limited company called the Kazui Press Limited. Takaoka's reputation as a letterpress printer was well established by then, and he was chosen to print certificates for the 1964 Tokyo Olympic medalists. Without Inouye, however, Takaoka was increasingly unsure about his Western typographic skills. He had never been to the United Kingdom or any other part of Europe. In order to keep abreast of the latest trends in typography and maintain his unique status in Japan, he joined the British Printing Society (BPS) in 1965.‚ÄúBPS Overseas Branch,‚Äù British Printing Society, accessed April 22, 2017, http://www.bpsnet.org.uk/branches/overseas.html.

In 1970, Takaoka made his first trip abroad to meet members of the BPS in London, bringing with him his latest letterpress work, Ars Typographica 1, and his business card, which was set in American Uncial. He traveled on from there to Frankfurt, Germany, to visit the D. Stempel AG type foundry to buy the Optima typeface designed by Hermann Zapf, who was then type director at Stempel. After returning home from Europe, Takaoka received a letter from Stempel saying that Zapf was very impressed with his printing and would like to meet him when he visited Germany again. In 1972, Takaoka and Eiichi Kono (see below for profile) traveled to Germany together with a group of Japanese printers to visit the Drupa trade fair, the world's largest printing equipment exhibition. During their stay, Takaoka met Zapf for the first time. After that, they visited each other a number of times and became lifelong friends. A snapshot of Juzo Takaoka taken during his visit to London in 2013 Takaoka frequently visited the UK and other countries in Europe to obtain metal types at type foundries and to deepen his ties with typeface designers, typographers, and letterpress printers.

It is also known as Central Asian lynx, Tibetan lynx or Himalayan lynx. It is widespread from west in Central Asia, from South Asia to China and Mongolia. There are 27,000 mature individuals in China as of 2013. It is proposed for the Turkestan lynx to be listed as Vulnerable in Uzbekistan. Taxonomy Felis isabellina was the scientific name proposed by Edward Blyth in 1847 for a lynx skin from Tibet. Lynx lynx wardi was proposed by Richard Lydekker in 1904. However, most authors considered it as synonymous to Lynx lynx isabelinus. Further investigations are in need in order to declare it whether as a separate subspecies or not. As of today, wardi is sometimes regarded as a synonym to isabellinus. Distribution and habitat The Turkestan lynx is one of the most widespread subspecies of Eurasian lynx. In Central Asia, the Turkestan lynx live mostly in open woodlands and steppe, and are also found throughout the rocky hills and mountains of the Central Asian desert regions. In southern Asia, it occurs throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and has been reported both from thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas above the tree line. The Turkestan lynx live in the Ladakh area of Kashmir, the Himachal Pradesh and other Indian states of the Himalayas region. In southern China, it occurs sporadically throughout the Tibetan plateau.

It is a long rectangular wood frame structure, built partly on land and partly on a series of granite piers projecting roughly south from the point. It is surrounded by a wooden deck, which is extended as a dock further to the south. The water-facing end of the building sports a curved porch with decorative turned posts and balustrades on the upper level, and large curved brackets below, making it resemble the poop deck of sailing galleons of the 16th and 17th centuries; this porch extends partway along the long sides. The building is clad in wooden shingles, and is topped by a gabled roof occasionally punctured by eyebrow dormers. The interior is largely finished in tongue-and- groove woodwork, with exposed beams in the ceilings. with According to local historians, the property was first developed in 1880, when Lewis MacDonald built a fish processing and canning facility. It was serving as a sail loft when it was purchased in 1897 by John Reynolds, Jr. In 1912, Reynolds had the existing building renovated (in a design attributed by the family to H.

More importantly, it reduces the resultant trauma, arising due to BABT (Behind Armour Blunt Trauma), by over 40 per cent as compared to standard conventional composite helmets, according to the tests conducted by HP White Laboratory, USA.\\"Military equipment manufacturer MKU to unveil NICS, Electro Optic devices at Defexpo 2016 in Goa\\", The Economic Times The company has recently been contracted by the Government of India to manufacture and supply 1.59 lakh ballistic helmets to the Indian army. The deal is estimated to be worth ‚Çπ170-180 crore. It's the first time in the last two decades that the Army has placed such a big order for helmets with an aim to enhance the fighting capability of its soldiers and provide them better protection on the battlefield. The existing helmets have serious limitations as they provide safety against only splinters, rocks, and bullets that have ricocheted and grazed the helmets. The soldier will likely incur injury or lose his life if the bullet is hit directly on the helmet. A crucial factor about the new helmets is they are bullet proof and can bear impact of 9 mm ammunition fired from a short distance. About 6000 of these helmets will go to the Indian Navy, and many of these helmets will be designed for integration with modern communication and night vision devices. These helmets are part of the modern military equipment that is designed to protect and improve the lethality of the soldiers engaged in counter-insurgency or counter terrorist operations.  Business  Platform Armouring MKU designs, manufactures and supplies ballistic kits to global forces for their tracked and off-road vehicles across ACVs (Armoured Combat Vehicles) & APCs (Armoured Personnel Carriers). These kits can be installed on platforms in real time in combat zones depending on the mission criticality and combat requirements, and often include standalone armours or add on armours, and spall liners. Spall liners protect the soldiers in APCs from spall effect arising due to penetration of hull by high speed projectiles like anti-material rifles. Such spall effect delivers multiple impacts on the occupants by injuries from fragments arising due to breach of vehicle hull from anti-material rounds. MKU has created armour panels for more than 20 types of helicopters including De Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter, Pilatus PC-6 Turbo Porter, Bell UH-1/212 Huey- Types, Boeing CH-47, Eurocopter B0-105, Eurocopter Puma/Super Puma/Cougar, Sikorsky CH-53, MIL MI-8/17, NH Industries NH-90. The company uses its German engineered patented system MODULARE SHUTZ TECHNIK and Polyshield V6 technology to build up to 40 per cent lighter and thinner armour panels for different aircraft that protect the platform from small handguns, assault rifles, armour piercing ammunitions, fragments, and heavy machine guns. A reduced weight of the panels also translates into more useful payload and increases the endurance of the aircraft which means the pilot can have more crew and more ammunition or rations inside the aircraft. The products are in use on warships as well for e.g. armouring German-built warships in Turkey.https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20080225-small-is-the- new-big-735431-2008-02-14 The Kanpur based defence manufacturer also joined with French defence technology giant Thales Group to produce night vision devices in the country.

The district includes at least 22 contributing buildings and two other contributing sites, one being a cemetery whose oldest stone is from 1739. Located on the west bank of the Sheepscot River and settled in the 18th century, Wiscasset was a prominent harbor in Mid Coast Maine, and a major shipbuilding and merchant port, until the War of 1812 ended its prosperity. The village center includes fine examples of Federal period architecture, most built between about 1780 and 1820, including one National Historic Landmark, the Nickels-Sortwell House. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The town of Wiscasset is located on the western bank of the Sheepscot River, at a wide point above the northern tip of Westport island, which the river passes on both sides en route to the Gulf of Maine. It is thus afforded with a deep and sheltered harbor area. Wiscasset was first settled by Europeans in the 1670s, but conflict with the local Native Americans (sometimes with French assistance) prevented significant permanent settlement until the 1760s. Incorporated as part of Pownalborough in 1760, it was incorporated as Wiscasset in 1794 when Pownalborough was split into Dresden, Alna, and Perkins. Wiscasset then also became the shire town of Lincoln County. It flourished as a shipbuilding and commercial center until the Embargo Act of 1807 damaged its economy, and the War of 1812 wrecked it. The town's economy has since been a shadow of that period's success, and development stalled, only sometimes punctuated by fires, which were mainly restricted to its waterfront areas. with During the height of its economic success, a significant amount of fairly high-style Federal architecture was built. Prominent examples are found along some of its residential streets, as well as United States Route 1, the main east-west route through the village, where the National Historic Landmark Nickels-Sortwell House stands. This house, built in 1805, is one of nation's finest examples of Federal architecture. Other prominent buildings include the public library, located in an 1805 brick mansion, and the former Wiscasset Academy building, built in 1807 and now housing an art gallery. The district also includes a few examples of later architecture, including the octagonal Capt. George Scott House on Federal Street. The Wiscasset Jail and Museum, built in 1809, is one of the state's oldest surviving jails, and is (like the Nickels-Sortwell House) a museum open to the public.

The men first shot his bodyguard, Engin Sever, and then shot Arƒ±yak. Arƒ±yak died on the scene and Sever died soon after at a hospital. A secret organization, the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide, claimed responsibility for the assassination via telephone messages. Arƒ±yak was survived by his wife and his 8-year-old daughter, who both were the witnesses to the assassination. The killers were not apprehended. On 17 December 2019, it was announced that New South Wales Joint Counter Terrorism Team established Strike Force Esslemont to re-investigate the murders. The reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction was increased from $250,000 to $1 million, which is the first ever million-dollar reward offered in Australia for an act of terrorism.

The trails of Vaughan Woods are open to the public daily from dawn to dusk. They may be accessed via two designated trailhead and parking areas. The Hallowell trailhead does not have a street address, but is easily located at the corner of Litchfield Road and Middle Street. The Farmingdale trailhead is behind the Hall-Dale High School tennis courts at 97 Maple Street. Access to the Homestead and gardens is restricted unless a public program is in session. Description and history Vaughan Woods & Historic Homestead is located south of downtown Hallowell on a property overlooking the Kennebec River, that is bounded on the north by Litchfield Road, the west by Interstate 95, the south by public lands containing regional schools, and the east by Greenville Street and small residential roads. The property covers nearly , much of it woodland. The northern third is separated from the south by Vaughan Brook, which flows east from Cascade Pond (on the property) to the Kennebec River. It is in this area that the Homestead and outbuildings are located. The house is a large and rambling structure, two stories in height. The original main block is the southernmost portion, except for a covered porch extending across its southeastern face. To the northwest of this block there are a series of ells, also mostly of 19th-century origin, one of which is in a distinctive octagon shape. The house is surrounded by terraced landscaping. with To the south and west of the house are woods, with hiking trails offering scenic views and access to historic uses of the property. The property was part of the once- large holdings of Benjamin Hallowell, one of the Kennebec Proprietors and the namesake of the city. Hallowell's daughter Sarah married Samuel Vaughan, son of a London merchant, and their two sons, Charles and Benjamin, moved to Hallowell in 1791 and 1797, respectively. Charles had the main portion of this house built in 1794 as a summer cottage, but when Benjamin and his family arrived from England in 1797, they turned it into their year-round home. Benjamin Vaughan was a merchant and diplomat, playing a critical role in negotiations ending the American Revolutionary War. Both Vaughans were active in the promotion of business and the economic development of Hallowell. By the late 19th century, a significant portion of the Vaughan estate had been sold off and cleared of trees. Vaughan descendants William and Benjamin Vaughan began in 1890 to repurchase portions of the estate and restore the woodlands. The present property is largely a product of their efforts. William's heirs donated a conservation easement to the Kennebec Land Trust in 1991, and the property was eventually taken over by a non-profit organization founded in 2002.

Khatwa is about designing by cutting of one fabric and stitching the pieces to another fabric. Khatwa is mainly used to create designer tents, canopies and shamianas. In textiles, applique is sometimes confused with patchwork. Though both techniques derive from the recycling of old fabrics by sewing different fabrics to create one piece, they are quite distinguishable. Patchwork refers to a variety of fabrics sewn together to create a single textile pattern. On the other hand, applique refers to a variety of coloured fabrics and ornaments, such as small round mirrors, layered on top of one another in order to create elaborate designs by means of various forms of stitching. There is no restriction to the type of fabrics used in the creation of applique items, and may even be of varying textures. It is often found alongside embroidery and can be sub-divided into two techniques. The simple 'play by ear' technique consists of the open use of an assortment of materials of various shapes and sizes, stitched together without much preparation. The more complex technique involves thorough planning of the design before any work is done with the materials. Khatwa is about designing by cutting of one fabric and stitching the pieces to another fabric. Khatwa is mainly used to create designer tents, canopies, shamianas and much more. Making of such tents involves work by both men and women. While cutting of clothes is done by men, women use their expertise in stitching part. Khatwa is also used in designing women garments as well. This is where the real talent of Bihar people is seen in the work. The designs created are more sharp, intricate and highly appealing. Most of the garments shop sell these highly artistic clothes. People in some villages of Bihar are involved only in art works and it is their main source of income. Since the same skills are passed down to generations, the expertise and innovations are immaculate. It is believed that applique work made its way into western India either from Europe or Arabia in the Middle East through trade contacts. It involves creation of designs by cutting one fabric and stitching the pieces onto another. ‚ÄúKhatwa‚Äù is used to craft decorative tents, canopies, shamianas, etc. A thick fabric and Geometric patterns are used while making the Tents on important occasion or functions.

Users must install the Media Feature Pack for Windows, and on Windows Server users must install Media Foundation features. Each RC software license is limited to 32 CPU cores and 3 GPU cards. For higher configurations, more licenses must be purchased equivalently. A computer with 4 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM and 386 CUDA cores is recommended. Meshing, coloring and texturing are completely out-of-core in RC, which is intended to avoid RAM performance loss during these processes.  History  The public beta version of RealityCapture was released by Slovak company Capturing Reality (founded in 2013), based in Bratislava, on 2 February 2016. However, there had also been a closed beta running for almost a year. Staff of Capturing Reality have published in several computer vision and graphics journals and conference papers, and have had hundreds of citations.

The barony is in size. There are 16 civil parishes made up of 125 townlands. It is one of 12 baronies in the county. The chief town is Mullinavat and it contains the settlements of Stonyford, Ballyhale, Hugginstown, Knocktopher, and Dunnamaggan. The M9 motorway bisects the barony. Knocktopher lies at the west of the county, the barony is bordered by Kells to the west (whose chief town is Kells), by the baronies of Shillelogher and Gowran to the north (whose chief towns are Bennettsbridge and Gowran), and the baronies of Iverk and Ida and to the south (whose chief towns are Slieverue and Piltown). The rivers Black Water, King's River, Little Arrigle, and Arrigle River flow through the barony. The Walsh Mountains make up a large part of the barony. Other historic sites include Norelands House, Saint Molings Well, and Goat's Bridge. Knocktopher was an early medieval cantred within the shire of Kilkenny, and part of the historic kingdom of Osraige (Ossory). Today it is part of the Roman Catholic Church diocese of Ossory and the Church of Ireland diocese of Cashel and Ossory. Knocktopher is currently administered by Kilkenny County Council.

In the latter 12th century, at the time of the Cambro-Norman invasion, MacBraoin (MacBreen) were the main Gaelic sept in the Knocktopher area. O'Donovan believed that the Clanna or Clanns, were seated in the barony of Knocktopher but were supplanted by the Breathnach or Bhreathnach (or Walshes meaning Welshman), who held land there after the Norman Invasion of Ireland. The Norman family of Wall was based there. The 1st Baron (feoffee) of Knocktopher was probably Griffin FitzWilliam, a Cambro- Norman knight from Wales, a son of William FitzGerald de Carew, Lord of Carew (of Carew Castle, Pembroke, Wales). Griffin Fitz-William was given the cantred [barony] of Knocktopher. Griffin and his brother Raymond le Gros took part in the conquest of Ireland. They were the grandsons of Arnulf de Montgomery and Princess Nest ferch Rhys, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr the last independent Prince of South Wales.See. Orpen, Vol 1, pp 181-182. The \\"Barony of Cnoktofre\\" was first mentioned in the year 1358. Knocktopher was recorded in the Down Survey (1656),, the 1840 Ordnance Survey Map and on Griffith's Valuation (1864). It was established by 1672 and depicted in Hiberniae Delineatio, \\"Perry's Atlas\\", engraved in 1671-2 by William Petty from the data of the Down Survey.

An indigenous territory () in Colombia is an area of land reserved for use of the indigenous peoples of Colombia. Almost one third of the country is covered by these territories, although the indigenous people account for just over 3% of the population. Legal situation As late as 1959 the Amazon region was considered uninhabited and was declared a natural reserve. The agrarian reform of 1961 recognized the need to define indigenous territories and to confirm as reserves (resguardos) the titles the Spanish crown had granted to the indigenous people. The first reserves were in the Amazon, the Vaup√©s reserve in 1982 with and the Vichada reserve in 1986‚Äì87 with . The government of Virgilio Barco Vargas between 1986 and 1990 gave titles to another in the Amazonas and Guain√≠a departments, forming a continuous indigenous territory of covering 50% of the Colombian Amazon. The 1991 National Constitution of Colombia defined Territorial Entities (Entidades Territoriales) as departments, districts, municipalities and indigenous territories. Within an Indigenous Territory Entity (ETI) the people have autonomy in managing their interests, and within the limits of the constitution have the right to manage resources and define taxes required to perform their duties. ETIs are to be defined by the government in conformance with the Organic Law on Land Management. However, this law has yet to be sanctioned so in practice the territories are unregulated. Geographical distribution The total area of Colombia is . , or 31.5%, is covered by indigenous territories. According to the 2005 census there were 41,468,384 people in the country of whom 1,378,884, or 3.28%, belonged to one of the 87 groups of indigenous people. The great majority of the indigenous people live in the Andean and Orinoco (savannah) zones. Large numbers in the Orinoco and Pacific Rim have land titles, but most in the Andes do not. Just 5% live in reserves (resguardos) in the Amazon zone. There are 156 reserves in the Amazon covering , or 64% of the total. Issues Some areas claimed by the indigenous people of the Amazon are used for mining and hydrocarbon operations. There is some overlap between protected areas administered under the National Parks System and the indigenous territories. Pressures on the indigenous peoples include depletion of the land, particularly in the Andes, and forced displacement due to the struggle with illegal armed groups. Gold mining and spraying of illegal crops causes pollution of the rivers, and in some areas the rivers are polluted by garbage. Oil extraction and dam construction also cause environmental problems in the reserves.

He died bankrupt after World War I, his hotel having been commandeered into a hospital during the war. During the 14 July 2016 attack on the Promenade des Anglais, Negresco's hotel once again became a field hospital used to aid victims. Early years and education Alexandru Negrescu was born 14 March 1870, in Bucharest, Romania, to a half Jewish father, Jean Negrescu (born 1837), an innkeeper, and Maria RƒÉdescu (born 1839). The family had lived in MihƒÉileni, Boto»ôani County prior to Alexandru's birth. He apprenticed with the confectioners Casa Cap»ôa, in Bucharest, and Casa Boissier in Paris, settling in Paris by 1895, though he may have traveled there before that date as well. Career Negrescu was known to have lived at No. 14 Rue des Saussaies, Paris, for many years. His first job in Paris was at a restaurant in the same building, owned by Rodolphe Schipper. He married Suzanne Bianca RƒÉdescu (born November 15, 1874, Bucharest) on 6 July 1907. They were known to have lived in Brussels, Belgium for a period, as their daughter, Germaine Henriette H√©l√®ne was born there on 4 December 1900. In 1909, Negresco became a French citizen. Negrescu moved to Monte-Carlo, working as a butler and then directing operations at Helder restaurant. He was also known to have worked at Londres, a restaurant-hotel, and it was here that he showed his talent to care for and retain elite customers, including billionaires, kings and princes, such as the Vanderbilt and Rockefeller families, Basil Zaharoff, and Isaac Singer. After Charles Lefranc, a merchant of Nice, recommended Henri Negresco to Edouard Baudoin, the new concessionaire of the Nice Municipal Casino (1979 demolition), Negresco accepted a casino restaurant management position at a salary of 20,000 francs per year, eventually becoming Director of the Nice Municipal Casino, and friends, in 1904, with the architect √âdouard Niermans. In this same period, Negresco bought the restaurant/casino Enghien-les-Bains, where he worked summers, alternating with the restaurant in Nice during the period of November through March. Through his relationship with Alexandre Darracq, land was purchased from the Faithful Companions of Jesus, to build a large hotel in Nice, with at least 400 rooms, for 1.2 million francs. After visiting hotels in Paris, London, Berlin, and Brussels, design plans were completed in May 1911, and construction began in September of that year. Negresco and Darracq established a company, Negresco & Cie, to operate the hotel with a registered capital of 1.11 million francs, which opened 4 January 1913. The Hotel Negresco, nicknamed \\"Le Palais de Belle √âpoque\\", was built by Niermans, the Dutch Belle √âpoque architect, in a style characteristic of 1872, on the Promenade des Anglais, facing the Baie des Anges. But in 1914, he was mobilized for World War I and the hotel was commandeered into \\"Temporary hospital no. 15\\". At the end of the war, the clientele did not return. Bankrupt, he died of liver cancer in Paris at 74 Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es, in 1920, and was buried at Batignolles Cemetery. In later year, his hotel was classified as a National Historic Monument (1974) and National Historic Building (2003) by the French state; the current owner is Jeanne Augier.

Formed in 2012, the band is named after Richard J. Hofstadter's 1964 essay The Paranoid Style in American Politics. Their first two releases were the EPs The Power of Our Proven System and The Purposes of Music in General. Both EPs were released together in 2013 by Misra Records in a limited release. The band's first physical release was the 2015 EP Rock & Roll Just Can‚Äôt Recall, released by Battle Worldwide Recordings. Their full-length debut, Rolling Disclosure, was released on July 15, 2016 on Bar/None Records. It was preceded by the single \\"Giving Up Early (On Tomorrow)\\", which was released earlier that month. The band's 2016 video for \\"The Thrill is Back!\\" - a shot-for-shot remake of Journey's \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\" was directed by Full Frontal With Samantha Bee producer Miles Kahn and featured comedians Jordan Klepper and Mary Houlihan. In 2017, the band released the EP Underworld U.S.A. via Bar/None and in 2018, they released a split single on Bar/None with Wussy. Bar/None also re-issued 2015's Rock and Roll Just Can't Recall in 2018 as an expanded release with three new songs. Critical reception Robert Christgau gave the Paranoid Style's 2013 EP The Power of Our Proven System an A- grade. In his review, Christgau wrote that \\"this band has yet to release a dull song\\" and that on the EP, the band \\"mine[s] a pop-rock vein that braces Nelson's cleanly uncrystalline articulation against Bracy's noisier guitar and a straight four that doesn't quit.\\" He later gave Rock and Roll Just Can't Recall an A grade, Rolling Disclosure an A- grade, Underworld U.S.A. an A- grade, and A Goddamn Impossible Way of Life an A grade. Spins Dan Weiss reviewed Rock and Roll Just Can't Recall favorably, describing it as \\"some of the smartest rip-and-roar you‚Äôll hear in a season mostly notable for its plethora of excellent releases by hungry rappers.\\" The Vinyl District's Michael Little gave the 2015 EP an A grade, saying, \\"I love Nelson and her band, paranoid or not. I expect great things of The Paranoid Style, because they have it all. They‚Äôre a thinking person‚Äôs rock band that never fails to set Nelson‚Äôs ingenious and humorous musings to great melodies, and then to jack up the volume to remind you that what you‚Äôre hearing is good old- fashioned explosive hard rock, in the vein of Sleater-Kinney only with better lyrics.\\" The following year, Spin premiered the single \\"Common Emergencies\\" (a collaboration between Nelson and Scott McCaughey from the Young Fresh Fellows). Of that track, Weiss wrote, \\"[it] is as good as any to introduce an unsuspecting indie-rock fan to Nelson‚Äôs confrontational melodies, referencing the novel As I Lay Dying and the Stones‚Äô 'Beast of Burden' in between its addictive call-response refrains, along with the aforementioned 'I've Been Working on the Railroad' flip and an unfashionably ripping guitar solo.\\" Also for Spin, Jason Gubbels gave Rolling Disclosure an 8 out of 10 rating, and described its songs as \\"doomsday anthems primed for a sock hop\\". Gubbels also wrote that on the album, \\"the drummer takes off, pianos crash, and a bemused all-male Greek chorus mugs along.\\" Marcy Donelson of AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5, and concluded by describing it as \\"the type of record that will sell tickets to shows, and maybe even inspire a new Hofstadter fan or two.\\" Jon M. Gilbertson reviewed the album favorably for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and praised Nelson's \\"tunefully dry delivery\\" that he said \\"gives a matter-of-fact wryness to the boisterous and dense indie-pop and indie-rock songs of the glorious first TPS album.\\" In 2018, Robert Christgau gave the expanded re-issue of Rock and Roll Just Can't Recall an A grade, saying, \\"Beefed up to eight songs to mark its embrace by a venerable label of indie luminaries from They Might Be Giants to Ezra Furman, this digital-only reissue of a superb self-released 2015 EP is designed to make fresh converts as first responders download the three new ones.\\" Christgau also gave the band's 2019 LP A Goddamn Impossible Way of Life an A, writing, \\"Squeezing 11 songs into half an hour, [Nelson's] voice relaxes enough to make them a pleasure. I don‚Äôt get all the jokes either‚Äîas a dual citizen, Nelson understands more about Irish history and politics than I ever will. But I do know a lot about Alan Greenspan and They Might Be Giants, whose songs establish that Nelson knows more.

Possible effects on disease transmission  alt=A video of Ken Mead, a man wearing a US Public Health Service service khaki uniform, discussing his research There is indirect evidence that toilet aerosol can be a vector for diseases that involve acute gastroenteritis with the shedding of large numbers of pathogens through feces and vomit, with normal use of a toilet unlikely to be a major health risk. For example, some epidemiological studies indicate transmission of norovirus in passenger airplanes and ships, and SARS coronavirus through a contaminated building sewage system, via contaminated toilets rather than other routes. The feces and vomit of infected people can contain high concentrations of pathogens, many of which are known to survive on surfaces for weeks or months, and toilets may continue to produce contaminated toilet plumes over multiple successive flushes. Some other pathogens speculatively identified as being of potential concern for these reasons include gram- positive MRSA, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the pandemic H1N1/09 virus commonly known as \\"swine flu\\". There is no direct experimental evidence on disease transmission by toilet aerosols. Whether or not aerosols can contain norovirus, SARS coronavirus, or other pathogens has not been directly measured . The combination of cleaning and disinfecting surfaces is usually effective at removing contamination, although some pathogens such as norovirus have an apparent resistance to these techniques.  Mechanism  Aerosol droplets produced by flushing the toilet can mix with the air of the room, larger droplets will settle on a surface before they can dry, and can contaminate surfaces such as the toilet seat and handle, which can then be contacted by hands. Smaller aerosol particles can become droplet nuclei as a result of evaporation of the water in the droplet; these have negligible settling velocity and are carried by natural air currents. Disease transmission through droplet nuclei is not a concern for many pathogens, because they are not excreted in feces or vomit, or are susceptible to drying. The critical size dividing these dispersal modes depends on the evaporation rate and vertical distance between the toilet and the surface in question. Experiments to test bioaerosol production usually involve seeding a toilet with bacteria or virus particles, or fluorescent microparticles, and then testing for their presence on nearby surfaces and in the air, after varying amounts of time. The amount of bioaerosol varies with the type of flush toilet. Older wash-down toilet designs produce more bioaerosol than modern siphoning toilets. Among modern toilets, bioaerosol production increases as qualitative flush energy increases, from low-flush gravity-flow toilets common in residences, to pressure-assisted toilets, to vigorous flushometer toilets often found in public restrooms. One study found that lowering the toilet lid prevented dispersion of large droplets, and reduced the airborne bacteria concentrations by a factor of 12. The study recommended discouraging the use of lidless toilets, and thus contradicts the US Uniform Plumbing Code specifications for public toilets.  History  Experiments on the bioaerosol content of toilet plumes were first performed in the 1950s. A 1975 study by Charles P. Gerba popularized the concept of disease transmission through toilet plumes. The term \\"toilet plume\\" was in use before 1999.

Johnson House is located southwest of Woodstock village, on the northwest side of Senior Lane, a former alignment of United States Route 4, whose present alignment passes just to the southeast. The original house is now at the center of a rambling complex of additions, extending mainly to its north and west. The house is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof, mostly clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. The gable ends and gabled dormers feature Victorian cut shingles and vergeboard decoration on the rake edges. A 1-1/2 story addition extends to the southwest, exhibiting similar styling. Porches extend across most of the main block and this addition, with chamfered square posts, jigsawn brackets, and decorative balustrades. Brackets similar to those on the porch are also found at the main roof cornice. The interior of the house features a fairly typical Georgian central hall plan, altered to open the spaces somewhat, and to provide access to the more modern wings of the building. It is richly decorated in a wide variety of woods and finishes, exhibiting to versatility of the original building owner's wood products. with The house was built in 1889-90 for Wales N. Johnson, the owner of a sawmill in nearby West Woodstock. It is one of a relatively small number of houses built in Woodstock during the late 19th-century, a local economic depression occasioned by the rise of more industrialized communities and the availability of better land for settlement in the American west. Johnson kept detailed accounts of the house construction, and oversaw the cutting of the wood (taken mostly from land he owned) at his own mill. For most of the years since 1940, the house has served as a tourist accommodation, under a variety of names.

It can be compared to the function of intermodal shipping containers. One advantage of an aircraft with such a configuration is that the loading and unloading processes cam be greatly accelerated; instead of emptying a plane of its payload and then reloading, the entire payload can be swapped out as a single action. This approach also allows for an aircraft to be rapidly changed between different configurations, such as to carry different cargoes, passengers, or specialised equipment payloads. So-called 'pod planes' can be divided into two main sections: the flying component that consists of the airframe, cockpit and engines; and the detachable pods, which would contain thecabin or cargo hold. The flying component and the individual capsules can be detached from each other and combined in different ways. Several experimental aircraft have flown to trial the concept, but this modular approach has remained in limited use at best through to the present day. History =Twentieth century= Kamov Ka-26 in aviation museum, Peenem√ºnde, Germany The concept was explored amid the Second World War as various nations endeavoured to improve their logistical situations through air power. In Nazi Germany, the Fieseler Fi 333 was an prototype transport aircraft developed amid the conflict that was supported by the Luftwaffe. As intended, the aircraft was to carry detachable pods of varying sizes for transporting cargo; it was believed that this arrangement was capable of allowing rapid turnaround times on the ground. In November 1950, the Fairchild XC-120 Packplane, an experimental military transport developed for the United States Air Force, performed its maiden flight. Described as a futuristic \\"pod plane\\", it was a development of the conventional C-119 Flying Boxcar, although the aircraft underwent evaluation flights including of its logistical capabilities, the project was ultimately canceled without any further production or direct follow-on effort.Staff, \\"XC-120 Goes to Eglin for Tests\\", Aviation Week, 11 June 1951, Vol. 54, No. 24, p. 15. During the 1960s, the Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe, a heavy-lift helicopter crane, could also be outfitted with exchangeable cargo pods; it was adopted in limited numbers by the United States Army and deployed during the Vietnam War for logistics purposes.Harding 1990, p. 243. NASA also made some use of the type. The CH-54 Tarhe would serve as the basis for the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane. Around the same period, work begun on the Kamov Ka-26, a Soviet helicopter furnished with an interchangeable modular pod. It was designed to carry a passenger module capable of seating up to 7 passengers when fitted, or two stretcher-bound patients and two seated patients with a medical attendant; in a cargo capacity, up to of physical goods or liquid chemicals could be conveyed. The platform was capable of crop dusting with the appropriate module installed, and could also carry underslung payloads.Taylor 1982, pp. 204‚Äì205. The Ka-26 was succeeded by multiple derivatives, including the Ka-126 and Ka-226, although these rotorcraft were relatively conventional and did not pursue a modular philosophy. =Twenty-first century= Clip-Air's Project Manager Claudio Leonardi presenting the air/rail transport system on 23 February 2018 During the 2000s, the Air Force Research Laboratory proposed a similar concept for military and civilian use in the configurable air transport: a blended wing body aircraft with multiple detachable, ground-mobile pods. The AFRL also performed proof-of-concept demonstrations under its Modular Aircraft Support System (MASS) program, which aimed at reducing the deployment footprint and increase supportability levels for aerospace ground equipment. Since 2009, the Clip-Air has been proposed by the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne. In terms of its basic configuration, it consists of a 60 m wide flying wing that includes the cockpit, engines and fuel; the aircraft is envisioned to lift up to three 30 m long, 30 tons modules for freight, fuel or 150 passengers. The Airbus A¬≥ Vahana was an electric-powered eight-propeller VTOL personal air vehicle prototype. The vehicle employed a modular cabin concept, known as Transpose, which was promoted as, amongst other benefits, allowing for new entertainment and commercial modules to be rapidly installed and removed from aircraft dependent on demand. The Transpose modulal design is reportedly compatible with the Airbus A320 family of narrowbody airliners, and can be provisioned at customer preference following the completion of a two year certification programme. During 2017, proposed its own modular aircraft concept. Around the same time, the Carpinteria, California-startup Dorsal Aircraft promoted its efforts to produce light standard ISO containers part of its unmanned freighter structure where the wing, engines and tail are attached to a dorsal spine fuselage. Interconnecting long aluminum containers carry the flight loads, aiming to lower overseas airfreight costs by 60%, and plan to convert a C-130H with the help of Wagner Aeronautical of San Diego, experienced in passenger-to-cargo conversions.

It is located in the local subdistrict of Klein Flottbek and today belongs partly to the quarters of Othmarschen and Nienstedten. Initially, Teufelsbr√ºck was the name of the bridge of the street of Elbchaussee over the Flottbek stream, later it was used for the area itself including nearby ferry pier and marina. The area lies south of the Jenisch park. Name The name goes back to an old legend. At the ford of the Flottbek stream, wagons frequently had accidents caused by broken wheels, so the inhabitants blamed the devil for it. A carpenter was assigned to build a bridge. But he made a pact with the devil and promised him the soul of the first creature crossing the bridge. On the day of inauguration, after a priest had blessed the bridge and the devil was looking forward for a human victim, the county councillor and the priest had a debate who should cross the bridge first. Meanwhile, a rabbit accidentally crossed it and the disappointed devil disappeared into the river.Teufelsbr√ºck, B√ºrgerverein Nienstedten This legend exists in similar form also for other bridges in Germany (see :de:Brickegickel), as well as for the Teufelsbr√ºcke in Sch√∂llenen Gorge, Switzerland.

This page provides an overview of the different claims being made. Sovereignty On the day of the referendum Lord Ashcroft's polling team questioned 12,369 people who had completed voting. This poll produced data that showed that 'Nearly half (49%) of leave voters said the biggest single reason for wanting to leave the European Union was \\"the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK\\". (\\"in the UK.\\" meaning: \\"by the UK.\\" logically implying: \\"on behalf of 66 million UK citizens not 508 million EU residents.\\") The sense that EU membership took decision making further away from 'the people' in favour of domination by regulatory bodies ‚Äì in particular the European Commission, seen as the supposed key decision- taking body, is said to have been a strong motivating factor for leave voters wanting to end or reverse the process of EU influence in the UK. Immediately prior to the vote, Ipsos MORI data showed that Europe was the third most highly ranked problem by Britons who were asked to name the most important issues facing the country, with 32% of respondents naming it as an issue. Immigration Lord Ashcroft's election day poll of 12,369 voters also discovered that 'One third (33%) [of leave voters] said the main reason was that leaving \\"offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders.. In 2015, net immigration to the UK from other EU countries was approximately 172,000, compared to 191,000 from non-EU countries. Immediately prior to the referendum, data from Ipsos MORI showed that immigration/migration was the most cited issue when Britons were asked 'What do you see as the most/other important issue facing Britain today?', with 48% of respondents mentioning it when surveyed. In the decade before the Brexit referendum there was a significant increase in migration from EU countries, as outlined by the Migration Observatory: 'Inflows of EU nationals migrating to the UK stood at 268,000 in 2014, up from 201,000 in 2013. EU inflows were mainly flat for the 1991‚Äì2003 period, averaging close to 61,000 per year.' According to The Economist, areas that saw increases of over 200% in foreign-born population between 2001 and 2014 saw a majority of voters back leave in 94% of cases. The Economist concluded 'High numbers of migrants don't bother Britons; high rates of change do.' Consistent with that notion, research suggests that areas that saw significant influx of migration from Eastern Europe following the accession of 12 mainly Eastern European countries to the European Union in 2004 saw significant growth in support for UKIP and more likely to vote to leave the European Union. Academic research investigating differences in Brexit vote among local authorities concluded that the Brexit vote was bigger in areas that had seen a large rise in the proportion of immigrants between 2004 and 2011. Goodwin and Milazzo say that \\"in areas where there were previously few migrants, increases in immigration will have a more noticeable effect ‚Äì and will be more likely to influence political behaviour\\" whereas ethnically diverse areas will perceive additional immigration as having little effect. They go on to explain that the non- British population of Boston in Lincolnshire became 16 times larger between 2005 and 2015, rising from 1,000 to 16,000. Boston also had the highest vote in favour of 'leave' in the UK, at just over 75% in favour of leaving the EU, which they believe is due to the effects of immigration seeming sudden and intense. They also argue that their data suggests that if Boston had experienced the UK average level of demographic change then the vote in favour of 'leave' would have been reduced by nearly 15% and they even suggest that areas such as West Lancashire may have had a majority for 'remain' if residents had experienced the average rate of demographic change. Furthermore, immigration has long been a contentious issue in Britain, with scepticism over the inherent value of immigration going back to well before the UK joined even the EEC in 1973 (which would later be incorporated into the EU in 1993). Britain had faced a surge in immigration in the post war period due to the influx of people arriving from former British colonies (immigration rules had been relaxed as a way of increasing the labour supply after the war). By the mid to late 1960s, there was concern from some people that the new immigrant population were arriving in excessively large numbers and were not integrating into British society sufficiently well. This concern is most widely recognised in former British MP Enoch Powell's famous Rivers of Blood speech made in 1968, in which he warns of the dangers of mass immigration. Powell's subsequent surge in popularity is often seen as a contributing factor in the Conservative party's surprise victory in the 1970 general election. Powell was influential on prominent Brexiteer Nigel Farage, who lists the politician as one of his political heroes. Demographic and cultural factors =Age of voters= It has been argued that the result was caused by differential voting patterns among younger and older people. According to Opinium, 64% of eligible people aged 18‚Äì24 voted, whereas 90% of eligible individuals over 65 voted. It is argued that older voters were more likely to vote 'leave' due to having experienced life in the UK prior to 1973, when the UK joined the European Economic Community which later became the EU, and this memory as well as any potential nostalgia may have influenced their decision. It is also argued that national identity is another reason older people voted Leave. Additionally, it is argued that some older people view immigration as a threat to national identity and culture, which is speculated to be why older people were more in favour of Leave than Remain. Furthermore, polls by Ipsos-Mori, YouGov and Lord Ashcroft all assert that 70‚Äì75% of under 25s voted 'remain'. Therefore, it has been argued that a higher turnout of older people and a lower turnout of younger people affected the overall result of the referendum as the older generation was more in favour of 'leave' than the 'remain' favouring younger voters. Additionally according to YouGov, only 54% of 25‚Äì49 year olds voted 'remain', whilst 60% of 50‚Äì64 year olds and 64% of over 65s voted 'leave' meaning that the support for 'remain' was not as strong outside the youngest demographic. Also, YouGov found that around 87% of under-25s in 2018 would now vote to stay in the EU. =Education level= Multiple sources have found a correlation between having a higher level of education and voting 'remain', as well as a correlation between having lower educational level and voting 'leave'. YouGov found that, among those who voted in the referendum, 68% of voters with a university degree voted 'remain', whereas 70% of voters educated only to GCSE level or lower voted 'leave'. Similarly, Curtice reports that \\"university graduates voted by around three to one in favour of Remain, whereas nearly four in five of those without any educational qualifications voted to Leave\\". It is proposed that those with higher education and higher occupational skills are more likely to value the economic benefits of globalisation, the Single Market and European membership, and so would be more inclined to vote 'remain'. Additionally, studies have shown that those with lower educational qualifications are more likely to be socially conservative and feel that European membership brings about constant and dramatic change to the UK, which would be an incentive to vote 'leave'. =The 'order versus openness' divide= Academic Eric Kaufmann notes the relatively strong positive correlation between a voter's support for the death penalty and their choice to vote 'leave'. He says that this highlights a social division that he calls 'order versus openness'. He further argues that 'The order-openness divide is emerging as the key political cleavage, overshadowing the left-right economic dimension'. This also links with educational factors, those who are educated to a lower level, generally, feel left behind by globalisation and ‚Äòfavour a ‚Äòdrawbridge up‚Äô policy of less European integration, closed borders and fewer migrants, whereas the latter group are in favour of greater openness and international cooperation.‚Äô It is argued that data from the British Election Study suggests that support for the death penalty is an example of how valuing 'order' over 'openness' could have affected voting behaviour in the referendum. Those who valued 'order' were more likely to support the death penalty and vote 'leave' than those who were 'pro-remain' and against the death penalty, which are stances considered to value 'openness' more. =The 'left behind'= Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford coined the term 'The Left Behind' to refer to 'older, white, socially conservative voters in more economically marginal neighbourhoods'. Analysing data the day after the Referendum, Ford concluded that 'Such voters had turned against a political class they saw as dominated by socially liberal university graduates with values fundamentally opposed to theirs, on identity, Europe ‚Äì and particularly immigration.' This was described as \\"if you've got money, you vote in... if you haven't got money, you vote out\\". In looser terms, these groups' wider dissatisfaction with the major political parties also had a significant impact on the vote ‚Äì with a particular focus placed on Labour's decline in support in the working class heartlands where it saw a significant number of votes lost to UKIP and the Conservatives in 2015. This was exemplifiied in 2019 when Labour lost several more seats to the Conservatives in their traditional heartlands, including seats such as Burnley who hadn't had a Tory MP for more than a decade. Many other academics have also suggested the link between voting 'leave' and a rejection of neoliberalism and globalisation and the sense of economic insecurity that some members of society have felt as a result of these economic processes. Bateman suggests that today's globalised world has contributed to the feeling of fast-paced changes in society and the economy, leading to the sense of being 'left behind', which she argues motivated some voters to vote 'leave'. In a similar manner to the arguments of Goodwin, Ford and Bateman it has also been suggested that both economically and socially 'left behind' groups \\"are united by a general sense of insecurity, pessimism and marginalisation\\", increasingly feeling as though liberalised society as well as the UK and European establishments do not represent their interests or share their concerns. The left-behind hypothesis is furthered using data on the EU referendum result across electoral wards level as well as across local authorities, suggesting that especially areas with high degrees of social deprivation and low educational attainment strongly voted in favour of leaving the EU. Since the result of the 2016 referendum, it is argued that euroscepticism has only increased, treating the notion as a consequence of the 'left behind' as opposed to a cause. Furthermore, the Brexit referendum is seen to have been a reaction against the austerity measures and the fact that people are living in poverty despite being in employment. More specifically, Brexit has also managed to further divide between those living in London and other cities that are in a strong economic position and those who live in small towns or the countryside where most votes to leave the EU were recorded. Similarly, support for UKIP was propped up because of austerity, and the EU referendum could have resulted in a remain victory if it wasn't for the austerity programme that was implemented. Calculations suggest leave support could well have been 6 percentage points lower. Consequently, the overall picture suggests that those affected by reforms in welfare, showed greater support for UKIP, and therefore voted Leave in 2016. Nevertheless, what is most striking economically, is that most people thought that Brexit would be bad for the economy and their own finances. However, they thought it would ensure lower immigration levels and the ability to claim back national sovereignty, even though most were not wary of the repercussions or did not think it would make any difference at all. =Britons felt less integrated with the EU than other European citizens= Academics James Dennison and Noah Carl argue that \\"the most important phenomenon to be explained vis-√†-vis the referendum result in our view is that a sizable Eurosceptic faction has remained extant in Britain over the last four decades\\". Using data from the Eurobarometer survey they showed that fewer Britons considered themselves European than any other EU nationality. Furthermore, they show that British trading patterns, capital flows and emigration patterns were the least Europeanised of any EU member state. John Curtice says that if voters \\"felt that membership of the EU undermined Britain's distinctive identity were more likely to vote for Leave\\" and goes on to report that the same was true for voters \\"with a weak sense of European identity\\". Such research implies that how attached voters felt to either Britain or to the EU influenced their decision, voting in favour of whichever identity they felt more strongly attached to. Furthermore, in terms of integration, Britain had developed a reputation of being \\"an awkward partner\\" in Europe. Britain's reluctance to integrate itself with Europe was reaffirmed by the position it was in following the conclusion of the Second World War. Its distinct sense of 'otherness' was reinforced by the fact that it was one of the only European states not to be occupied during the war. Its empire, while exhausted, remained intact, and senior civil servants still regarded Britain as a major global power. A Foreign Office assessment following the war's end noted that \\"Great Britain must be regarded as world power of the second rank and not merely as a unit in a federated Europe\\".Bullen, R. Pelly, M. (Eds) Documents On British Policy Overseas, Second Series, Vol. II, HMSO, 1987, p. 115 (doc. 33.) Once Britain joined the EEC, this reluctance towards integration was seen further. The UK had the most opt-outs of any member state, and along with Ireland was the only member to acquire an opt-out of the Schengen Area agreement. It has notable opt-outs from the European monetary union, and individual pieces of European legislation regarding Justice and Home Affairs. It has been suggested that Britain's reservations about European integration, as well as its unique historical position within Europe and stance of remaining less integrated than other EU states, laid the groundwork for the potential that Britain would decide to exit the bloc. =Identity and change= The widening of the north-south divide and the increased concentration of wealth held by (usually London-based) financial and educated elites, is also thought to have played a role in the referendum outcome. De- industrialisation in Northern England left many feeling economically left behind and forgotten about compared to the South East in particular, a feeling intensified by the globalisation associated with EU membership. It is believed that this feeling of change happening elsewhere in the country whilst there was economic stagnation in the North was an incentive for many to vote 'leave' and indeed much of Northern England voted strongly in favour of Brexit. A more nuanced analysis shows that a North-South division is too simplistic, as many great northern cities (Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, York) voted 'remain' whereas many small towns and rural areas in the South voted 'leave'. Feeling as though the UK has been rapidly changing and feeling negatively towards that change is considered to have been a reason that many voters backed 'leave'. Goodwin and Milazzo report that identity and preventing a loss of national identity as a result of national change, were highly important to many leave voters. Furthermore, they found that among those who felt that during the preceding ten years Britain had gotten ‚Äòa lot worse‚Äô the average Leave vote was 73%, compared to 40% among those who felt the country had gotten ‚Äòa lot better‚Äô. Additionally, it is thought that the rise in liberal social movements and an increase in social change played a role in leading some voters to vote 'leave' as a rejection of such change. Polls conducted by Lord Ashcroft showed that \\"of those who think that feminism, the internet and the Green Movement are bad for us were, respectively, 22%, 6% and 26% of those polled, and of those groups, 74%, 71% and 78% respectively were Leave voters\\".https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum- result-7-graphs-that-explain-how-brexit-won-eu-explained-a7101676.html =English national identity= The World Economic Forum 2017 acknowledged in its Global Risks Report that \\"the Brexit and President-elect Trump victories featured (...) appeals to sovereignty rooted in national identity and pride\\" and that it would \\"be challenging to find political narratives and policies that can repair decades-long cultural fault-lines\\". English nationalism played a key role in shaping the result of the referendum. As the largest constituent country within the United Kingdom, England provided the largest share of 'Leave' voters, 15,188,406 to 'Remain's' 13,266,996, and saw the largest margin of victory for 'Leave' at 53.4% to 46.6%. Scotland and Northern Ireland, on the other hand, produced 'Remain' supporting majorities, whilst Wales produced a slim 'Leave' majority. Some academics have argued that \\"England's choice for Brexit was driven disproportionately by those prioritising the English national identity\\", and that English nationalism is a \\"cluster point\\" for other attitudes and concerns, such as \\"hostility to European integration, the sense of absence of political voice, concern about immigration, and support for parties of the right\\". Economy There were some advocates of Brexit who saw leaving the EU as an economic opportunity for Britain. This was in contradiction to the Remain campaign's warnings of economic damage as a result of Brexit and differed slightly from voters feeling economically left behind by EU membership. Those who saw economic opportunity tended to be sympathetic towards free market and free trade ideas, viewing the regulatory nature of the EU as imposing on personal market freedom. Proponents of free trade post-Brexit hope to strike trade deals with nations outside of the EU, away from EU regulations, believing this will boost Britain as a market, benefit the economy and lead to less government expenditure in GDP. Politicians such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg have become associated with this point of view. Additionally, the 2008 financial crash and the Eurozone crisis of late 2009 may have encouraged others to want to move the UK's economy further away from Europe's increasingly integrated economy as a means of protecting it. According to a 2019 study in the American Economic Review, austerity reforms introduced in 2010 may have contributed to a Leave victory in the Brexit referendum by raising political dissatisfaction. Anti-establishment populism The idea of voting in favour of Brexit was seen by many as a way to protest against the Establishment and the elite who were seen to have ignored \\"the will of the people\\" for too long. The result of the referendum was branded as such by Nigel Farage, who claimed it to be a victory against \\"big merchant banks\\" and \\"big politics\\". Many voters saw the referendum itself as an example of power being given back to the citizens to make decisions and not the elites, with many voters harbouring discontent for these elites and the power they hold. For some voters, voting 'leave' defied the Establishment that was seen to be pro-Remain. The populist nature of the referendum was an incentive for many to take the opportunity they felt they had to have their voices heard over those of the elite and vote 'leave'. It has been argued that anti-politics played a part in the referendum. Marsh argues that ‚Äòthe distrust of the political elite‚Äô is an important feature of anti-politics. Furthermore, Marsh relates this to populism, stating that the ‚Äòdistrust in the political elite was particularly evident in the campaign‚Äô. According to Jennings and Lodge, David Cameron made arguably a futile attempt to reduce the impact that anti-politics was having on British politics by calling the referendum, which ultimately did not succeed. Iaknis et al. conduct a survey which shows how the vote to leave the European Union was influenced by nativism and anti-establishmentarianism. This survey gives an indication as to how anti-politics influenced the Brexit vote. Baldini et al. discuss how during the 2015 and 2017 general elections, voters were more likely to change their vote, which was then linked to the rise of anti- politics. Role and influence of politicians =Decision to call referendum= The referendum was first announced by then-Prime Minister David Cameron on 23 January 2013. Cameron announced that he would attempt to re- negotiate Britain's terms with the EU before holding an in-out referendum no later than two years after the next general election ‚Äì should he still be Prime Minister. This was seen as a move to appease Eurosceptics within his own party as well as an attempt to regain voters who had been switching allegiance to UKIP since the previous election. Upon the Conservatives surprise majority victory in the 2015 general election, Cameron upheld his pledge and announced the date for the referendum to be 23 June 2016. =Effect on voters= Boris Johnson and cabinet minister Michael Gove becoming leading figures in the Leave Campaign is a factor considered to have given the pro-Brexit side a wider appeal and greater credibility. Johnson is believed to have been heavily influential during the campaign, with polling results revealing that the public trusted the words of Boris Johnson on Brexit more than any other politician, including David Cameron. In regard to the Labour Party, there was some perceived ambiguity as to the party's stance with only 52% of voters believing Labour MPs were in favour of Remain, according to polling. In actuality it is thought that as many as 96% of Labour MPs backed remain. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is known to have been a longtime eurosceptic, having voted against staying in the Common Market. Furthermore, the chair of the official Leave campaign was Labour MP Gisela Stuart. It is thought that the perceived lack of clear direction from the party may have played a role in some Labour voters backing 'leave' despite most of its MPs backing 'remain'. =Establishment euroscepticism= Despite many perceiving the Establishment as being pro-Remain, the British Establishment has historically contained a significant eurosceptic fraction that has cut across both the Labour and Conservative parties. It is thought that the existence of such euroscepticism within Britain's elite has helped ensure that eurosceptic thoughts, voices, opinions and sometimes policies have had somewhat of a platform, consequently influencing public opinion. During the 2016 EU referendum campaign, 45% of Conservative MPs were in favour of leaving the European Union - a considerable amount which held significant influence over public opinion. Historical examples of euroscepticism within the Labour party include the 1975 referendum on European membership, the position and influence of Tony Benn and Hugh Gaitskell's famous 1962 speech in which he said joining the EEC would be \\"the end of a thousand years of history\\". Presentational factors during the campaign =Information interpretation= A \\"Vote Leave\\" poster in Omagh saying \\"We send the EU ¬£50 million every day. Let's spend it on our NHS instead.\\" Michael Dougan, Professor of European Law at the University of Liverpool, in a viral video of one of his lectures prior to the referendum, described the Leave campaign as peddling \\"dishonesty on an industrial scale\\". Perhaps the most commonly criticised claim by the Leave campaign was that voting to leave the EU would allow for increased spending on the NHS of ¬£350m a week.Vote Leave's early claim that the '350 million' will go to the NHS Vote Leave claimed that the UK sends ¬£350 million to the EU every week. The Office for National Statistics, quoting analysis from the European Commission, states the UK's actual net average annual contribution to the EU budget, taken from a five-year average from 2014 to 2018, when its annual rebate and public and private sector receipts are excluded, is ¬£7.7 bn. Divided by 52, this equates to ¬£150 million per week. Sir John Major claimed that Vote Leave had deliberately misled voters by using the gross contribution to the EU before the automatically deducted UK Rebate. The gross contribution is the amount the UK would pay under the standard formula before any discounts and rebates. The UK currently gets a 40% discount from the gross contribution which was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s (worth about ¬£144 million) plus various agricultural, economic development and scientific research 'rebates' (worth approximately a further ¬£96 million).Source: HMRC Elements of the Leave campaign have been identified as exemplifying \\"post-truth politics\\", in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion rather than the details of policy or objective factual analysis. This potentially deliberate attempt to mislead the public finds relevance with Hobolt's theory, that campaigns prey on voters' insecurities. Individuals with low education levels will be less likely to be able to separate factual and false information, thus forming the existential link between educational and campaigning factors. This makes voting behaviour hard to analyse because it uses the incorrect assumption that all citizens vote rationally and have the ability to critique policy. =Branding and wording choices= It has been argued that the 'Leave' brand was stronger and more effective than the 'Remain' brand. According to Mike Hind, a marketing professional, \\"The Britain Stronger In Europe brand was stillborn. On the basis of preparation, presentation and messaging, it deserved the kicking it got.\\" Additionally behavioural practitioner Warren Hatter argues that 'Leave' as a word places a lower cognitive load on observers than 'Remain a member of'. =Prospect theory= Economics writer Chris Dillow has argued that, among other factors, Prospect Theory may explain the surprising willingness of many voters to take a path widely viewed as the more risky of two (change vs status quo). In his words Prospect Theory 'Tells us that people who feel they've lost want to gamble to break even. This is why they back longshots on the last race of the day or why they hold onto badly performing stocks. People who had lost out from globalization, or felt discomforted by immigration, voted Leave because they felt they had little to lose from doing so.' =Vote Leave analysis= Dominic Cummings, Campaign Director of Vote Leave wrote in The Spectator in January 2017 on \\"how the Brexit referendum was won\\". He wrote: \\"Leave won because 1) three big forces [the immigration crisis, the 2008 financial crisis and the euro crisis] created conditions in which the contest was competitive, AND 2) Vote Leave exploited the situation imperfectly but effectively, AND 3) Cameron/Osborne made big mistakes. If just one of these had been different, it is very likely IN would have won.\\" \\"Pundits and MPs kept saying ‚Äòwhy isn‚Äôt Leave arguing about the economy and living standards‚Äô. They did not realise that for millions of people, ¬£350m/NHS was about the economy and living standards ‚Äì that's why it was so effective. It was clearly the most effective argument not only with the crucial swing fifth but with almost every demographic. Even with UKIP voters it was level-pegging with immigration. Would we have won without immigration? No. Would we have won without ¬£350m/NHS? All our research and the close result strongly suggests No.\\" \\"If Boris, Gove, and Gisela had not supported us and picked up the baseball bat marked 'Turkey/NHS/¬£350 million' with five weeks to go, then 650,000 votes might have been lost.\\" =Shortcomings of the Remain campaign= Whilst the Leave side may have made good tactical decisions during the campaign, part of its success came from the Remain campaign failing to provide convincing enough counter arguments or arguments of their own. A lot of the Remain's campaign was built around spreading the notion that Brexit would weaken Britain, yet Curtice notes that the campaign offered little explanation as to \\"how the UK economy might be strengthened further by continued EU membership\\". He goes on to argue that the Leave campaign were offering such explanations, exemplified by the claim that ¬£350 million a week could be spent on the NHS, regardless of whether or not this was a valid claim. One analysis of the Remain campaign has concluded that the campaign did little to counter Vote Leave's arguments surrounding immigration, an area that was considered one of Leave's biggest pulling factors in attracting voters. Furthermore, the official leaflet supplied by the government to make the case for remaining in the EU failed to address the issue of sovereignty, which was another area that Vote Leave was gaining a lot of support. In addition, the remain campaign focused very heavily on the 'risk' posed by Brexit, but analysis in the time since shows this may have been a mistake. Analysis carried out by Harold D. Clarke, Matthew Godwin and Paul Whiteley, appears to show that those who had an unfavourable view of immigration and felt that too much decision making had been taken away from the UK government, were much more likely to minimise the risk of Brexit, partially because they perceived they had little to lose. Policy decisions =Decision not to impose tougher migration restrictions= It has been claimed that the role of migration as a key factor in driving voting behaviour at the referendum originates from the relatively high levels of net migration into the UK in the last decade. In particular it is claimed that the decision not to impose restrictions on EU migrants after the addition of the 'A8' (Eastern European) countries to the EU in 2004 (at a time when other European countries did impose such restrictions) contributed to a spike in migration levels that underpins contemporary voter attitudes. =European migrant crisis= U.S. President Donald Trump stated that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open her country's borders for more than a million refugees and illegal immigrants was a \\"catastrophic mistake\\" and \\"the final straw that broke the camel's back\\", allowing the Leave campaign to win. Furthermore, Nigel Farage and long-term Eurosceptic party UKIP used images from the refugee crisis during their campaign to increase the anxiety about immigration that the crisis caused, prompting criticism from some \\"Leave\\" and \\"Remain\\" supporters. Leading Leave campaigner Michael Gove said that it was \\"the wrong thing to do\\", whilst then-Chancellor George Osborne of the Remain side stated that the poster \\"had echoes of literature used in the 1930s\\" in Germany. The role of the media The Guardian journalist Jane Martinson noted that many of the UK's biggest selling newspapers, The Sun and the Daily Mail in particular, but also including The Daily Telegraph and Daily Express, have been Eurosceptic for many years. The implication of this is that the political stance of the print media could have shaped the public's opinion before the referendum. The BBC was also criticised by many remain-supporting pundits for false balance which helped give the leave campaign credibility. Leading up to and during the EU referendum campaign, Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph, Daily Express and The Sun were all pro-Leave. Curtice argues that as these were \\"more popular\\" newspapers, their support not only provided credibility to the Leave campaign but also meant that there would be \\"sympathetic coverage\\" for its pro-Brexit arguments. Seaton explains that long-term anti-EU reporting, demonisation of foreign nationals and the working class in mainstream media could have made the public more susceptible to pro- Brexit arguments, as well as having \\"shaped the debate\\". Seaton also comments on the effect of social media on the referendum, which played a much more prominent role in the campaign and the vote than in previous votes in the UK. Seaton argues that social media was highly influential in shaping voters' opinions as social media enables users to \\"get more of what you like\\" whilst being able to \\"avoid exposure to what you disagree with\\" on a platform that is \\"driven by popularity\\". Another element of media which has yet to be mentioned is the role of social media which arguably was the most effective platform. Media democracy is the way journalists were more concerned by the entertainment factor of news content, rather than being informative. Some accused printed media of being too \\"politically correct\\", whereas the same limitations were not shared by social media. Twitter was the most utilised social media platform and the campaigns were led through the use of 'hashtags'. Llewellyn and Cram conducted a study that involved tallying how often certain 'hashtags' were used and concluded by noting that overall there were more ‚Äòleave‚Äô hashtags than ‚Äòstay‚Äô even though ‚Äòstay‚Äô equated to the largest percentage.Llewellyn, C., Cram, L. (2016). Brexit? Analyzing Opinion on the UK-EU Referendum within Twitter, The Neuropolitics Research Lab, School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh, pp. 760‚Äì761 This referendum also saw the intense use of 'twitter bots'. Gorodnichenko et al. analysed two types of social media agents ‚Äì real (human users and bots) and social bots (composed of algorithm). Social media platforms such as Twitter supported ideas such as ‚Äòecho chambers‚Äô and therefore enhanced ideological segmentation and made information more fragmented to separate rather than unite people. In turn Twitter became known as the best platform for spreading 'fake news'.Gorodnichenko, Y., Pham, T., Talavera, O. (2018). ‚ÄúSocial Media, Sentiment and Public Opinions: Evidence From #Brexit and #USElection‚Äù, Swansea University On the other hand, others claim that the sentiment results always indicated a likely 'Leave' result but it is not pinned down to bots or any dark loitering propaganda systems, instead it was lack of ‚Äòremainers online mobility‚Äô that caused the outcome. On the day of the referendum, ‚Äòremain‚Äô activity reached an all-time high of 38.5% on Twitter, but also Instagram came into play almost as much as Twitter did but due to it being a less direct platform, was not as noticed.

His books were banned during the Nazi years but he remained in the country and was conscripted for aircraft monitoring during the war. During the postwar period, in what had become the Soviet occupation zone, he was a co-founder, in 1948/49, of the anti-communist Combat Group against Inhumanity (\\"Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit\\"). Life G√ºnther Birkenfeld was born in Cottbus and grew up in Berlin. He received his doctorate in 1923, and went on to work as an editor with the publishing house. Between 1927 and 1930 he was General Secretary of the (Schutzverband deutscher Schriftsteller). His youthful novel Dritter Hof links (published in English as A Room in Berlin) appeared in 1929, and was well received, also appearing in translation. The political backdrop changed savagely in January 1933 when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Birkenfeld's first novel was banned in GermanyRichard Drews und Alfred Kantorowicz (Hrsg.): Verboten and Verbrannt. Deutsche Literatur 12 Jahre unterdr√ºckt. Heinz Ullstein - Helmut Kindler Verlag, Berlin und M√ºnchen 1947, p. 23 (although the English language translation appears still to have been available in London). Dritter Hof links appeared again on the list of banned books, together with his subsequent novel Liebesferne (1930), when the list was updated and reissued in 1938. During the twelve years the Nazis were in power, Birkenfeld (as he later explained to in 1947) managed to carry on in what was termed inner emigration in a low profile lectureship, also producing several popular biographical novels including one on Johann Gutenberg and another on the emperor Augustus. He was also conscripted, during the Second World War, for aircraft monitoring. War ended in May 1945 and Berlin was divided into zones of occupation between the principal victor nations. Birkenfeld obtained a licence from the US occupation zone to edit and produce a twice monthly newssheet entitled Horizon: Newssheet for the younger generation (Horizont: Zeitschrift der jungen Generation).Ursula Heukenkamp: Nachkriegsliteratur in Berlin, in: Ursula Heukenkamp (Hrsg.): Unterm Notdach, 1996, p. 29 The title defined its target readership. Contributors were for the most part also from the younger generation, writing about problems of reorientation and training for a transformed postwar era.Karin Siegmund: ... etwas zu sagen haben, auch unter Drei√üig, in: Ursula Heukenkamp (editor & compiler.): Unterm Notdach, 1996, p. 444-447 Under the leadership of the 45 year old Birkenfeld the young journalists rejected any form of intellectual suppression of important themes. That was particular criticism of the energetic ideological kidnapping of youth by the new Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED) and its youth wing, the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend / FDJ) across Berlin, most notably in the Soviet occupation zone which incorporated what would become known as East Berlin. The newssheet dealt primarily with political and social matters, but also featured a section headed \\"The arts of the future\\" and, from 1948, an \\"Experiments\\" section which provided a forum for established younger literary contributors such as Wolfdietrich Schnurre (1920‚Äì1989), (1925-2015) and Ingeborg Euler (1927‚Äì2005). Horizon ceased to appear in September 1948 after newsprint (paper) ran out due to the Berlin Blockade.J√ºrgen Engler: Die \\"Schizophrenie\\" des Anfangs, in: Ursula Heukenkamp (Hrsg.): Unterm Notdach, 1996, p. 422 On 9 November 1945 the Protection Association of German Authors was reinstated under authority from the Soviet occupation forces in the eastern part of Berlin, now as a division of the Free German Trade Union Federation, and Birkenfeld was installed as a member of its executive. He retained this function, as the political and economic division of the city (and of the country) progressively became more visible and permanent, till 1949.J√ºrgen Engler: \\"Geistige F√ºhrer\\" und \\"arme Poeten\\", in: Ursula Heukenkamp (Hrsg.): Unterm Notdach, 1996, p. 72f; p. 84f In his approach to former Nazis, Birkenfeld took a hard line. This was on display in the \\"Hausmann debate\\" in April 1947 at which G√ºnther Weisenborn argued for a more nuanced position, whereby there should indeed be a very harsh approach to former Nazi activist criminals, but otherwise \\"display generosity\\". For Weisenborn this meant that despite recent reproaches to Thomas Mann, the author should nevertheless be invited to the 1947 writers' congress; Birkenfeld rejected this.J√ºrgen Engler: Die \\"Schizophrenie\\" des Anfangs, in: Ursula Heukenkamp (Hrsg.): Unterm Notdach, 1996, p. 397f The first German Writers' Congress took place between 4 and 8 October 1947 in the eastern sector of Berlin, and was addressed by Birkenfeld on the theme of \\"Collaboration of Writers' Organisations\\" (Zusammenarbeit der Schriftstellerorganisationen).Waltraud Wende-Hohenberger (Hrsg.): Der Frankfurter Schriftstellerkongress im Jahre 1948, Peter Lang Verlag Frankfurt 1989, p. 75 On the morning of 7 October he was elected to chair the day's proceedings. The morning was dominated by a keynote speech from Melvin J. Lasky who was deeply critical of censorship in the Soviet Union and the persecution of the Soviet writers Mikhail Zoshchenko and Anna Akhmatova. This, in turn, drew strong protests from Soviet guest delegates at the congress, in a session choreographed by Birkenfeld.Christine Malende: Berlin und der P.E.N.-Club, in: Ursula Heukenkamp (Hrsg.): Unterm Notdach, 1996, p. 102fWaltraud Wende-Hohenberger (Hrsg.): Der Frankfurter Schriftstellerkongress im Jahre 1948, Peter Lang Verlag Frankfurt 1989, p. 45 Birkenfeld was one of twenty German writers nominated to found a German section of PEN International, based on a resolution of the international organisation at its twentieth congress in Copenhagen. This followed consultation with PEN International's General Secreatary Hermon Ould, and with Wilhelm Unger representing the London exile group. The group of twenty fulfilled their mandate with a launch congress at G√∂ttingen on 18‚Äì20 November 1948, under the leadership of Hermann Friedmann. As it became apparent that the ground was being cleared, especially within the Soviet occupation zone, for a return to one-party dictatorship under the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Birkenfeld was taking am increasingly public position against Communism, at least from the launch of the Berlin Blockade in June 1948, and possibly earlier. On 19 September 1948 he was a co-founder of the \\"League for Spiritual Freedom\\" (Liga f√ºr Geistesfreiheit). Early in 1949 he was a co-founder of the anti-communist Combat Group against Inhumanity (Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit). In 1950, together with Theodor Plievier and , Birkenfeld called for the separation of the German PEN organisation from the \\"Becker Group\\" which represented the organisation in what had become, formally in October 1949, the separate German Democratic Republic (East Germany).Christine Malende: Berlin und der P.E.N.-Club, in: Ursula Heukenkamp (Hrsg.): Unterm Notdach, 1996, p. 125ff This led directly to the establishment in 1951 of a separate West German PEN organisation under the presidency of Erich K√§stner. Birkenfeld worked as a political commentator with the Broadcasting Service in the American Sector (RIAS) (of Berlin). and as an editor with the publishing house Suhrkamp Verlag. At Suhrkamp he became embroiled in controversy when he demanded that the author Anna Seghers should at least mention somewhere in her novel Die Toten bleiben jung that German soldiers involved in the invasion of the Soviet Union had not been universally hostile to the civilian communities - there had been some who had befriended the population. In the dispute that ensued, the proprietor Peter Suhrkamp distanced himself from Birkenfeld's demands, and it was left to the company's publishing director to negotiate a solution with a determined author.Ursula Reinhold: \\"Beitr√§ge zur Humanit√§t\\", in: Ursula Heukenkamp (Hrsg.): Unterm Notdach, 1996, p. 176f References People from Cottbus German non-fiction writers German opinion journalists German journalists 20th- century German literature German translators German lexicographers Social Democratic Party of Germany 1901 births 1966 deaths 20th-century translators 20th- century journalists ","title":"G√ºnther Birkenfeld"},{"id":"51081112","text":"Ed Reid, (c1915 - 1977) was an author and investigative journalist who exposed organized crime in New York City and Las Vegas.

Fredelo Fredelo (or Frithelo, French Fredelon) (d. between 1083 and 1085), of unknown parentage, was the patriarch of the house of Esch, which produced several notable knights in service of the Crusades. Fredelon's family were likely vassals of Henry III, Count of Luxembourg, and his brother and successor William. Fredelon was avou√© (or vogt) of the abbeys of Malmedy and Echternach, and also known to be their despoiler. Fredelon was an accomplice to Giselbert, Count of Clermont, in a variety of nefarious enterprises. Fredelon and Giselbert terrorized the region near Nandrin preventing inhabitants from performing even the basic of tasks. Henri de Verdun, Bishop of Li√®ge, gave this land to Conon, Count of Montaigu, forcing Fredelon and Giselbert to restore the resultant damage. Fredelon and Giselbert were the lords of castle Clermont in 1095 and engaged in brigandage, although these two regarded their activity as the legitimate levying of tolls on river traffic. Otbert, Henri's successor, organized a siege of the castle but was unsuccessful. A 1095 entry in the chronicle of Giles of Orval reveals that Otbert's objective was ultimately accomplished by purchase, resulting in the enfeoffment of the property to his vassal Lambert, Count of Montaigu. Giselbert subsequently joined the First Crusade. It is unclear as to what Fredelon did after his ouster. Children of Fredelo Fredelon was married twice. By his first wife, whose name is unknown, he had two sons: * Henry of Esch (d. after 1097) (Henricus de Ascha), Crusader with Godfrey of Bouillon * Godfrey of Esch (ilius Fredelonis, unus de collateralibus duds Godefridi), Crusader with Godfrey of Bouillon. Second, Fredelon married Ermengarde, Countess of Clermont, widow of Gozelon, Count of Montaigu. Fredelon and Ermenrgard had one son: * Giselbert (d. after 18 March 1131), Count of Esch, who married Aelide, of unknown origin. It is unclear how Giselbert was to become the Count of Esch and it is not until two generations later that another Count of Esch appears. Later generations Giselbert, son of Fredelon, (to distinguish him from Fredelon's accomplice Giselbert, Count of Clermont) had at least one son, Renard (d. after 1157), who was Seigneur de , and had some relationship with Godefroi, Count of Montaigu and Clermont. He married a woman named Lietgard, daughter of Robert Richira. They had a son Henri (d. after 1187), also Seigneur de Hermalle-sous-Huy, who witnessed a charter in 1182 regarding a matter involving Conon, Count of Montaigu and Duras. The next generation also include Godfrey II (Gottfried) (d. 1150 or after), Count of Esch, although it is unclear which of the sons of Fredelon was his father. He married Alix de Grandpr√©, widow of Godefroi, Count of Durbuy. Godfrey and Alix had five children: * Robert (d. 25 August 1170), Abb√© de Foigny * Heinrich II * Friedrich * Bartholom√§us von Esch (d. before 1192) * Ermengarde. Bartholom√§us founded the Priory of Ufeldange in 1182, as described in a charter confirmed by Arnold I of Vaucourt, Archbishop of Trier. The name of his wife is unknown, but they had two children: * Godfrey III von Esch (d. after 1182) * Heinrich III von Esch (d. before 1220) Heinrich had a son Robert I von Esch (d. between 13 October 1262 and January 1266) who married Ermengarde d‚ÄôAspremont (d. after 1271). Ermengarde was brother to Jean d‚ÄôAspremont who was both Bishop of Verdun from 1217-1224 (as John I of Aspremont) and Bishop of Metz from 1224-1238 (as Johann of Aspremont). Ermengarde's parents were Ida of Chiny, daughter of Albert, Count of Chiny, and Gobert V, Lord of Aspremont. Robert's son Heinrich IV von Esch appears to have been married to a member of the House of Salm but the precise relationship there is unclear. His son Godfrey d‚ÄôEsch was the last member of the House of Esch to appear in historical documents, participating in the Tournament of Chauvency, sponsored by Louis V, Count of Chiny. Godfrey was championed by his niece Perrine.

Engelmuller driving gloves - vintage poster Emil Engelm√ºller inherited the Engelm√ºller glove shop in 1895 from his father Ferdinand Engelm√ºller. Ferdinand founded his first glove shop in Prague in 1865, but due to high quality of his products he was soon able to expand across the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and he opened new shops in Vienna and Budapest. After ten years of Emil Engelm√ºller‚Äôs management, in February 1904, Engelm√ºller presented new driving products at the first automobile exhibition in Bohemia, where the Czech automobile club was founded. Besides new gloves, the range featured elegant leather coats, drivers‚Äô peaked caps and leather helmets. Since then, Engelm√ºller was forever connected with driving gloves and motoring accessories. ‚ÄúMr Emil Engelm√ºller is our leading designer in his field.‚Äù wrote the magazine Sport & Games in 1908. The outbreak of World War I led to a decline in exports and the loss of some traditional European markets, but this was quickly counterbalanced by supplies to the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. In 1915, Emil Engelm√ºller‚Äôs son Richard enrolled in the air force, and after the war brought back inspiration from the ‚Äúlozenge‚Äù camouflage used on his aircraft. This design pattern would later become a hallmark of the brand. The First Republic of Czechoslovakia brought the Engelm√ºller brand its heyday. Its shops offered leather suits, caps, gloves and trousers made of the best Russian and Swedish leather. Its advertisements appeared in the majority of motoring and society magazines, such as Automobil, Motor Revue or Touch of society. Engelm√ºller gloves were worn by car racing driver Eli≈°ka Junkov√°, by Czech aerobatics legend Franti≈°ek Nov√°k, actress L√≠da Baarov√° and many others. Engelm√ºller glove styles were also popular with international automobile racing stars such as Tazio Nuvolari, Louis Chiron and Bernd Rosemeyer. Before World War II, the Engelm√ºller company was manufacturing gloves for pilots of Czechoslovak Air Force and many Czech pilots still wore them during Battle Of Britain while fighting for Royal Air Force. After German occupation in 1939, the company‚Äôs entire output was commandeered by the Wehrmacht. The worst moment for Engelm√ºller was still yet to come. Emil Engelm√ºller died in 1944, one year before the end of the war, and in 1948, the company was nationalised by the new Communist regime. Engelmuller was revived as gloves and luxury motoring-related goods manufacturer in 2015, and on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of its founding, the brand has launched a new collection that pays homage to its past, ensuring that its tradition lives on.

The cathedral was initiated by the then Bishop of Comayagua Alonso Vargas y Abarca, continued by Bishop Fray Juan P√©rez Carpintero and completed by Bishop Fray Antonio L√≥pez de Guadalupe, most of the construction work took place between 1685 and 1715 when it was solemnly blessed.  Architecture  = Inside = alt= It consists of a Latin cross plan with three naves with a barrel vault, with five sections, the presbytery is covered with three hemispherical domes. It has an annex where the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is located. On the main altar you can see a gilded wooden altarpiece, with a carving of the image of the Immaculate Conception made in 1620 by spanish artist Francisco de Ocampo and donated to the city by King Felipe II of Spain. The eight images that are distributed in the temple were donated by Felipe VI of Spain as well as the crucified one donated in 1620 and made by the Ja√©n sculptor Andr√©s Ocampo.The temple also has an organ, which arrived in the city on December 7, 1887 and was premiered in the Cathedral of Comayagua. The organ is no longer frequently used, an exception only for Holy Week, Christmas, or Weddings. Outside258x258pxOutside, the fa√ßade has a Renaissance and baroque style. Its made in the form of an altarpiece with three streets, the central one wider where the semicircular arch entrance door is located. The streets are divided vertically by attached columns and horizontally by cornices forming four floors. Inside some niches of this facade, there are the images of four doctors of the Church in the side streets and in the central one, on the third floor, there are the statues of the Virgin Mary and on their sides Saint John the Baptist and Saint Joseph, finally on the fourth floor is the figure of Christ blessing. The four-story bell tower stands out on the left side of this main fa√ßade, the last one is where the eight bells that it has are placed, later in its construction to the fa√ßade, this bell tower is finished off with a glazed colored ceramic dome. = Clock = alt= In the tower of the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in the Americas, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. Before it was transferred to the americas it was working in the Alhambra arab palace in Spain. On the orders of King Felipe III of Spain, it was transferred to the Hibueras region of the New Spain where it would function as the city's clock. The clock mechanism is based on gears, ropes, weights and a pendulum, the whole set shows the time on the dial located on the facade of the church where the number 4 in Roman numerals is shown as IIII and not as IV. There is a conflict between whether or not it is the oldest on the planet, its contender is a watch found in England and it is alleged that it is the oldest, however, it is made on the basis of cast iron and that of Comayagua in wrought iron base, of the two techniques the wrought iron is older than the one used in the English clock so it follows that the Comayagua is the oldest.

It provides a last line of defense for chemical safety; it does not replace more proactive measures like engineering controls. There are some considerations with chemical protective clothing. For instance, no clothing is \\"impervious,\\" since all clothing will eventually seep in chemicals. CPC also prevents evaporation, causing skin temperature to increase and potentially increasing the permeability of skin. CPC that has not been tested for the specific operating condition it is used in may not provide adequate protection. The same material, even at the same thickness, may provide different levels of protection depending on the manufacturer, since different manufacturers use different processes and may add different additives. Finally, while the test data will provide information on individual chemicals based on \\"worst-case scenario\\" continuous contact testing, most industrial exposures are not continuous and are in fact mixtures of chemical, for which permeation rates are different. When selecting CPC, it is recommended to determine: * The chemicals being used * The state of those chemicals; for example, if they are vaporous, they could be more hazardous * Whether contact is a result of occasional splashing or a result of more continuous contact * Whether the worker can be exposed from handling contaminated CPC * The room temperature where the chemical is being handled * The parts of the body that the chemical could potentially contact * Whether the CPC resists physical wear and tear commensurate with the type of work being done * Whether the CPC interferes with the work, for instance by limiting dexterity From there, it is recommended that candidate garments srehould be selected and subject to appropriate testing. Testing is also considered necessary to make sure the material is suitable to the specific condition it will be used in, as opposed to the generic, worst-case scenarios it ordinarily undergoes. Once a garment is selected, it should undergo a limited evaluation with worker training. Once the garment is regularly used it should be regularly evaluated.

And see: ‚ÄúAntwerpen stelt tentoon. Luc Piron: de mens als Fremdk√∂rper‚Äù, in: De Standaard. ?????.. 1976. In 1977, Piron was invited to take part in an exhibition called Rubens Now at the ICC, the International Cultural Center, in Antwerpen. ‚ÄúThe Internationaal Cultureel Centrum (ICC) in Antwerpen is the first official institution for contemporary art in Flanders. In the 1970s and the early 1980s it contributed decisively to the reception of Belgian and international avant-garde art,‚Äù according to a statement of the other major art museum in Antwerpen, the Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp or M HKA.‚ÄúHet Internationaal Cultureel Centrum (ICC) in Antwerpen is de eerste offici√´le instelling voor actuele kunst in Vlaanderen.

A year later he cooperated with the composer and sound artist Baudouin Oosterlynck in a performance and environment, the Bondage Room.See: Bibliotheek van Museum van Bommel van Dam, museum library, data base of artist, kunstenaars database: http://www.artindex.nl/bib_vbvdv/default.asp?id=6#=0839101719038050496290137007800180303715. The Bondage Room performance was an advanced intervention, by Luc Piron and Baudouin Oosterlynck, that reflected his thirst for radical experimentation, but it also reflected the spirit of the times.According to the book Niet van gisteren, by Frank Huygens and Anne Van de Voord that focuses on Luc Piron and other artists, this was a turbulent time: In Michelen, for instance, it saw ‚Äúde opleiding aan de academie onder Ernest Albert en Geert Reusens, de legendarische carnavalbals van Academia, het beruchte caf√© Herten Aas van Frans Croes, verzamelplaats van hippies en provo‚Äôs (de kabouters), het Progressief Komitee voor Artistieke Werking [‚Ä¶] en de alternatieve sc√®ne op de Vismarkt, eind jaren ‚Äô60 ‚Äì begin jaren ‚Äô70 (De Muze, de Verloren Zoon, den Akker en de eerste Dijlefeesten) [‚Ä¶].‚Äù See: Frank Huygens and Anne Van de Voord, Niet van gisteren. Een Generatie Kunstenaars in Mechelen 1945-1975, Mechelen : Stad Mechelen 2010. Middle and late period In 1980 Piron had several exhibitions, including one exhibition in the Museum of Contemporary Art known as the Centraal Museum in Utrecht (The Netherlands).See: Museum Hedendaagse Kunst, Utrecht, catalogue with texts by Marcel Boon and Samuel Ijsseling. He was featured in several publications, including a radio broadcast.See: ‚ÄúKunst en vliegwerk‚Äù, radio program, Oct. 8, 1980, Hilversum IV NCRV , and see the article in Kunst en Cultuur, Oct.1, 1980. The next year, he exhibited in the gallery Pieter Celie.The exhibition was entitled Versuchskaninchen. See: the text by Jo Walbers in the catalogue Versuchskaninchen, May 1981. He was featured in an article by Robert Melders, in De Standaard, June 12, 1981. In addition to many exhibitions in Belgium and The Netherlands, Luc Piron exhibited in such countries as Spain, Germany, Italy, and India. Thus, he had an exhibition in Bilbao (Spain) in 1982.See: Arteder Bilbao, catalogue, 1981. In the same year, his work was discussed in the book Kunstbeeld in Vlaanderen vandaag ‚Äì ‚Äú100 Vlaamse kunstenaars.‚ÄùKunstbeeld in Vlaanderen vandaag ‚Äì ‚Äú100 Vlaamse kunstenaars‚Äù, Antwerpen : Collection M HKA, and Tielt : Lannoo, 1982Tielt : Lannoo, 1982. There were other notable exhibitions, such as the one discussed in 1986 by Willem Elias in the journal VUB Nieuw Tijdschrift.Willem Elias, ‚ÄúKunst en Wetenschap‚Äù [Art and Science], in: VUB Nieuw Tijdschrift, Vol. 2, No.1. In 1992, his exhibition ‚ÄúInitialen vaan een verloren landschap‚Äù took place in the renowned Lens Fine Art Gallery in Antwerpen.See the catalogue ‚ÄúInitialen van een verloren landschap [Initials of A Lost Landscape]‚Äù, Antwerpen : Lens Fine Art Galerij, 1992, with a text by Bert Popelier. In that year, Piron was also invited to take part in the Euregionale international exhibitions in Hasselt that featured artists from the Euregio (Belgium, The Netherlands; West Germany), and that was co-organized by the Ludwig Forum f√ºr Internationale Kunst (for short: Museum Ludwig) in Aachen, Germany.See the Euregionale catalogue with a text by Carine Elen. In early 1993, Etienne Wynants reviewed the exhibition ‚ÄúEuregionale ‚Äò92\\" in the art magazine De Witte Raaf. The exhibition in Hasselt, organized in cooperation with , the director of Museum Ludwig in Aachen, featured works by Gabriele Heider, G√ºnther Beckers, Malou Swinnen, Luc Piron, Roel Knappstein, Paul Devens, Daniel Dutrieux and Andr√© Delalleau in the Provinciaal Museum, Hasselt (Feb. 1993). Wynants overall impression was not so positive. But the art critic praised the work of G√ºnther Beckers (‚ÄúWaarlijk een kunstschilder uit de Euregio Maas-Rijn, zoals een reeks mystiekerige portretschilderijen, enkele concerttaferelen en een serie aquarellen illustreren‚Äù) and ‚Äúa series of variations of the landscape theme, lyrical abstract drawings and paintings, done by Luc Piron‚Äù.In Flemish: ‚Äúeen reeks variaties op een landschap, lyrisch abstracte tekeningen en schilderijen van Luc Piron[...]‚Äù See: Etienne Wynants, ‚ÄúEuregionale '92: een flop‚Äù, in: De Witte Raaf, Vol. 41, Jan.-Feb 1993; also online: http://www.dewitteraaf.be/artikel/detail/nl/386. In Germany, his participation in the Figurenfeld project received attention repeatedly in 2005. Piron's computer graphiques shown in the context of the exhibition ‚ÄúErfahren, Erinnern‚Äù (Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt) reflect on insane, cruel war. They were stimulated by the 'Figurenfeld' land art ensemble of Alois W√ºnsche-Mitterecker.

And in 2010, he was invited to take part in the exhibition ‚ÄúNiet van Gisteren‚Äù in the Cultural Center Mechelen.See Frank Huygens and Anne Van de Voord, Niet van gisteren. Een Generatie Kunstenaars in Mechelen 1945-1975, Mechelen : Stad Mechelen 2010. (‚ÄúHet boek dat verschijnt naar aanleiding van de tentoonstelling is niet opgevat als een tentoonstellingscatalogus.‚Äù [The book that appeared on the occasion of the exhibition is not regarded as an exhibition catalogue.] See: http://www.cultuurraadmechelen.be/assets/files/orde/855/e-melaan_2010_04.pdf.) During the last decades, Piron has become increasingly interested in the relationships between surface, space, and material. Research related to themes such as ‚Äúthe void‚Äù and ‚Äúchance‚Äù resulted in minimalist paintings, prints, computer art, and drawings.Hedwig Neesen refers to Piron's paintings as ‚Äúminimalistische‚Äù (minimalist) works. See his review of Piron's exhibition of photos and paintings in Diest, ‚ÄúOde aan de Demer in 200 foto's‚Äù, in the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad, Feb. 23, 2014. Luc Piron's painterly reflections on ‚Äúthe Void‚Äù and his minimalism are perhaps inspired by Western artists like John Cage who were influenced by the I-Ching and also by Zen Buddhism. A group exhibition he joined in 2007 reveals his interest in Buddhism, too. It may not be by chance that he chose to participate in the exhibition ‚ÄúInstitut Tibetain Yeunten Ling ‚Äì tentoonstelling 80 kunstenaars‚Äù (Huy, Belgium, March 25 ‚Äì April 9, 2007).

Since 2010, Luc Piron discovered photography as an artistic medium. His photographic oeuvre tends more towards graphics than to pure photography ‚Äì he calls it ‚Äúphotographics.‚Äù He has taken photos of the landscape of his area, the Flemish Hageland. And he worked for three years on a series of photos focused on the landscape of the Demer river, capturing the four seasons. The result was summed up in artist book, ‚ÄúDemer ‚Äì Het Land Langs de Rivier‚Äù (2014).Demer ‚Äì Het Land Langs de Rivier (Demer, the Land along the river) with 200 photos by Luc Piron and poems by Miel Deville and Andreas Weiland.

It was also discussed in the article ‚ÄúFototentoonstelling toont Demer tijdens alle seizoenen‚Äù [photo exhibition shows Demer during all seasons], in the daily Het Laatste Nieuws, Feb. 25, 2014. (The article is also accessible here: http://www.art-in-society.de/AS13/LPD/HLN1.html.) See also: Frances Morelli and Edward Yang, ‚ÄúLuc Piron's 'Photo-graphiques' of the Demer Landscape‚Äù, in: Art in Society, No. 13 ‚Äì an article which describes Luc Piron's ‚Äúphoto- graphiques‚Äù of the Demer as ‚Äúquiet, detached works.‚Äù See also Art in Society No. 7 and No. 8. In his series ‚ÄúShelters‚Äù Piron drew on the Flemish love for cabin [cubicle] and brick architecture. Another large series of photos, entitled ‚ÄúThe Invisible Time‚Äù (‚ÄúDe on-zichtbare tijd‚Äù) engages in a dialogue with Edward Muybridge's ‚ÄúThe Human Figure in Motion‚Äù in a new pictorial style. The oeuvre of Luc Piron cannot be placed in a stylistic category or an -ism. He remains an experimenting artist in today's visual art. Presently Piron is based in Tielt-Winge. His wife, Greet Stroobants, is a ceramics artist.  Teaching  In addition to being an independent artist, Luc Piron has also taught etching for a number of years at the Flemish Art Academy in Brussels.See the biographical note provided by the website etching.blotspot http://etsen.blogspot.be/2006/06/piron-luc-1952.html.

They were armed with ten 18-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder bow chasers. Built at Rochester, Kent by Mary Ross, Bold was launched on 13 July 1812 and commissioned on 12 September 1812 under Commander James K White. Service In early January 1814, some crew volunteered to reinforce the squadron on the Great Lakes, together with men from Fantome and Manly. Seventy men left Halifax; they reached Kingston, Ontario on 22 March, having traveled some 900 miles in winter, almost entirely on foot.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 33, pp.123-7. Mathew Abdy, Master of HMS Thistle was one such volunteer, but he died of exposure in Woodstock, New Brunswick in February 1814, and is buried there. She was subsequently commanded by Lieutenant I Burch during the operations in the Chesapeake, and was present during the actions at Washington and Baltimore. After the Battle of Lake Borgne, with Thistle, Aetna, Meteor, Herald and Pigmy, went up the Mississippi River to create a diversion. These latter five ships were to take part in the Siege of Fort St. Philip (1815).Fraser (1930), p.294. She was subsequently captained by Commander J Montague in January 1815. She returned to Great Britain after the end of the War of 1812, and was paid off on 7 August 1815. She was recommissioned in May 1819, and was commanded by Lieutenant Robert Hagan, and deployed to the African station, under whose command he captured 40 sail of vessels and liberated 4000 slaves.

In 1740 the mayor of San Salvador, Manuel G√°lvez del Corral, reported that in San Miguel there was a parish church, two convents (San Francisco and La Merced) and two hermitages (San Sebastian and Calvary). In 1862 the parish church, which bore the name \\"St Michael Archangel\\", was demolished to build a larger temple that would also serve as an oratory of veneration for the Virgin Our Lady of Peace. It is presumed that the first stone was laid by President Gerardo Barrios on November 21 of that year. The first person in charge of its construction was the English engineer William Kirk who had to leave the project shortly after the death of Barrios. Still unfinished, the temple received the rank of cathedral by papal decree of Pius X, on 11 February 1913. Eight years later, on November 21, 1921, Monsignor Juan Antonio Due√±as y Argumedo proclaimed the Patronage of Our Lady of Peace and gave papal coronation of the image on behalf of Pope Benedict XV. The cathedral was declared completed in 1962 with the promotion of then pastor Oscar Romero, exactly a century after construction works had started.

In 1999, Fernandez was sentenced to 12 to 15 years for conspiring to sell narcotics. He is the main figure in the HBO documentary, Latin Kings: A Street Gang story, which was released in 2007. He is also featured in the book, The Misfit Economy, by Alexa Clay, which was published in 2015. Upon his release, Fernandez has shared his insights as a former gang leader and political activist, and how that relates to the \\"legitimate world\\". Latin Kings Latin Kings patch In 1997, a few months after his appointment as leader of the Latin Kings, The New York Times posed the question whether Fernandez was a \\"Man of Vision or of Violence.\\" They concluded he was the former, a man with the self-assigned mission of transforming the Latin Kings from an organized crime syndicate to a political movement, fighting for social justice on behalf of suppressed Latin American communities. He seemed set for a life of addiction and crime until he went to prison and found solace in a gang. He saw something in the criminal organisation that others didn't - a place that offered the structure and love that he needed to beat addiction. From his own experiences he knew the Latin Kings had more to offer. Mirroring the activism of groups such as the Young Lords and the Black Panthers, he wanted to reform and rebrand the Latin Kings and its 7,000 members. He united the divided sects of the gang and presented his ideas at local meetings, building the new principles of the Latin Kings from the ground up. He had former gang members canvass for politicians and feed the homeless. The younger members were given curfews and sheltered from elder members who were entrenched in crime. The police called him a \\"gangster with a PR campaign,\\" but to many he was a symbol of hope. Latin Kings: A Street Gang story In 2007, HBO released a documentary called \\"Latin Kings: A Street Gang story\\", which was primarily a biography of Fernandez. Created by award-winning documentary maker Jon Alpert, it depicts two sides to Fernandez' role as head of the Latin Kings. It portrays him as a symbol of hope who empowered the Latin American Community, and increased the King's membership by more than a 1000 people. It also portrays him as a man who could not practice what he preached. Despite asking his Latin King members to find legitimate employment and to reject a life of crime, he continued to use his position as leader of the Latin Kings to assist in large scale narcotic transactions. Misfit Economy Fernandez was featured in the 2015 book, The Misfit Economy, by best selling author Alexa Clay. The book explains how his approach to managing the Latin Kings is transferable to the \\"legitimate economy\\".

Formed by Tom Grey, a Methodist minister, the organization educated communities about the negative effects of gambling. It became part of the Stop Predatory Gambling Foundation in 2008. History The NCALG was formed in 1994 by Tom Grey. Their goal was to educate the American public about the effects of gambling, including economic, political, and physical effects. They held annual national seminars across the country, partnering with many other organizations including Citizens for a Stronger Pennsylvania, The NCALG had a branch called the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion (NCAGE). NCAGE was under the same board of directors; however, it focused on working with grassroots organizations to prevent the spread of legalized gambling. The organization contributed to Congress passing the National Gambling Impact Study Commission Act, which established the National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 1997. Through their efforts, they \\"defeated casino gambling\\" in several states including Ohio, Arkansas, and Florida. They aided in closing slot machines in South Carolina and a lottery in Alabama. They were also on the advisory board for the Citizens' Debate Commission. As the group became bigger, it became the Stop Predatory Gambling Foundation, which was formed in 2008. Les Bernal is the national director of Stop Predatory Gambling. Tom Grey continues at the organization as the senior advisor. It is a not-for-profit educational organization that is now headquartered in Washington, D.C. Founder and other members Tom Grey was the founder and executive director of the organization. Grey was a Methodist minister from northwestern Illinois. He is also a Vietnam veteran. He graduated from Dartmouth College as well as from the Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary. He created the organization after 80 percent voters in Illinois voted against the building of a local casino. The Illinois Gaming Board ignored public opinion and built the Galena casino regardless. Grey saw an opportunity to increase awareness of gambling and its effects on local communities. In May 1994 he organized the NCALG with a network of individuals from almost all 50 states and Canada. Grey hosted a number of seminars in South Carolina in 1999. In these seminars he also discussed the dangers of video gambling. Bernie Horn was a spokesperson for the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling. In 1995, Ron and Mary Helen Hyde were asked by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to help with NCALG. The Hydes turned their home into a national information center for NCALG. The office began with a computer, fax machine and a phone line, but expanded. In 2003, Grey offered William Bennett the position of executive director of NCALG, dispute having a reported gambling addiction. Ideology NCALG argued that the social and economic effects of gambling are detrimental to a community. They asserted that gambling triggers addictive behaviors, and therefore, by legalizing gambling, more youth will be exposed to the addiction of gambling. NCALG pointed out that casinos bring more crime into a community. Grey stated that the main debate is about gambling institutions giving false promises about the chances of winning. \\"What they sell is an addictive product,\\" he said. \\"The job of government is to protect and serve people‚Äînot to addict and rob them.\\" References External links *National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling records, MSS 2046 at L.

Life Veichtner was born in Regensburg, where his father, Johann Georg, worked as a violin maker. In his youth he studied at the Jesuit school in his hometown and later with the violinist, composer and theorist Joseph Riepel. Support from a generous benefactor enabled him to study violin with Franz Benda in Potsdam where he performed and made acquaintances with Carl Friedrich Fasch and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. In 1763, Veichtner entered into the service of Count Herman Karl von Keyserling in K√∂nigsberg and Saint Petersburg. In K√∂nigsberg, Veichtner taught the young Johann Friedrich Reichardt, who he called a \\"true artistic genius\\" who was despised by \\"all the external pomp\\". To show his gratitude, Reichardt dedicated a violin concerto to his teacher in 1772. In 1765 Veichtner became Konzertmeister and Kapellmeister at the court of Peter von Biron in Mitau, Courland. He was joined in the orchestra by his brother Michael who was employed first as a violinist, and later as a \\"contra violinist\\". During his time in Mitau, Veichtner taught music and composed prolifically for the court. He is known to have composed numerous Singspiele, occasional works, Tafelmusik and around sixty symphonies during this period, however very little of this music seems to have survived. Veichtner also married twice while resident in Mitau; first to Catharina Maria G√∂ttsch on 26 January 1768, and again to Rosanna G√∂ttsch in 1771. In 1785, he undertook a trip with the court to Italy, giving successful concerts in Milan and other cities. In 1795, Veichtner left Mitau, when the Duchy of Courland was annexed by Russia, and traveled for a second time to Italy. In 1798, he found employment in Saint Petersburg where he worked as a chamber musician at the imperial court, and concertmaster of the opera orchestra. He remained in Saint Petersburg until his retirement in 1820. He returned to Mitau where he spent the final two years of his life with his eldest son, Karl Ludwig, and his family in the Forstei Kliewenhof (now the parish in Kalnciems). Veichtner had nine children. One of his sons, Heinrich Konstantin, was a violinist (father of poet and editor - Konstantin von Veichtner). Another, Karl Ludwig, married to Cath. Constanze Nott, was a step- father of baroness Wilhelmine von Meck - mother of an important 19th century Russian businessman - Karl Otto Georg von Meck.Carola L.

The attempt was carried out by a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces that organized themselves as the Peace at Home Council. They attempted to seize control of several key places in Ankara, Istanbul, and elsewhere, but failed to do so after forces loyal to the state defeated them. The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey's loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup. The government said the coup leaders were linked to the G√ºlen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah G√ºlen, a Turkish businessman and cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government stated G√ºlen was behind the coup (which G√ºlen denied) and said the United States was harboring him. G√ºlen has suggested the coup was in fact a \\"self-coup\\" carried out by Erdoƒüan to consolidate his grip on power, a view shared by some political analysts and Turks. Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey. During the coup, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured. Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air. Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and, for reasons that remain unclear, 2,745 judges. 15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to G√ºlen. More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to G√ºlen. Reactions to the event were largely against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally. The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders‚Äîsuch as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighbouring countries‚Äîcalled for \\"respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.\\" International organizations expressed themselves against the coup as well. The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement. President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said the head of United States Central Command, chief General Joseph Votel, was \\"siding with coup plotters\\", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon's contacts in Turkey. In March 2017, Germany's intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoƒüan's statement that Fethullah G√ºlen was behind the failed coup. The same month, the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d'√©tat attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah G√ºlen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the UK designating the G√ºlen movement as a \\"terrorist organization\\".British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee: G√ºlen not responsible for the 15 July coup attempt Repression or recovery? UK's relations with Turkey, Parliament.uk, 25 March 2017  Background  = Kemalism = It is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played little or no role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, unlike all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey's military. Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life. The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks who were attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women's wearing of headscarves. The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997. In addition, the military has banned several major political parties. In 1998, Erdoƒüan, who was the mayor of Istanbul at the time, was banned for life from politics, and jailed, because he had read a certain poem several years before, at a public meeting. In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah G√ºl, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum, but G√ºl was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter, and also a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament. = AKP‚ÄìG√ºlen alliance and \\"Ergenekon\\" = As opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey's AKP government and pro-government media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah G√ºlen. Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed \\"Ergenekon\\". Supported by Islamist (both pro-G√ºlen and pro-Erdoƒüan) prosecutors, security officials and media, the purges gave an opportunity to lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions. They were seen as a bid by Turkey's civilian leaders under President Erdoƒüan to establish dominance over the military. In these trials in 2013 ‚Äì viewed as \\"sensational\\" and \\"one of the biggest in recent Turkish history\\"Ergenekon: Court quashes 'coup plot' convictions, BBC News (21 April 2016). ‚Äì 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called \\"Ergenekon\\" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then‚ÄìPrime Minister Erdoƒüan. Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer. Simultaneously, Erdoƒüan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army. The AKP's alliance with G√ºlen started to collapse during 2013 as G√ºlenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges. After the split, Erdoƒüan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army. The \\"Ergenekon\\" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven. = Role of corruption = In 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoƒüan. The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the G√ºlenists and the AKP. In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be \\"rife\\" in Turkey. Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions. = Immunity bill = On 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoƒüan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations. The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while cases against lower-ranking soldiers may be signed off on by district governors. The immunity bill was seen as part of the d√©tente between the government and the armed forces, while the latter have increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.  Events  = Attempted takeover = Turkish SAT Commandos and Battleship Search and Rescue (MAK) troops, attacked the hotel where President Erdoƒüan stayed. On 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were witnessed flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m said military action was being \\"taken outside the chain of command\\" and it was an \\"illegal attempt\\" to seize power by \\"part of the military\\". He further said that those involved \\"will pay the highest price.\\" Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul's Atat√ºrk Airport. It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Twitter later stated that it had \\"no reason to think we've been fully blocked\\". Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar. At around 21:00, the coupists had invited , the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters. When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended. , head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter. The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process. He refused and was then taken to the Akƒ±ncƒ± Air Base along with other commanders at the headquarters. The military also entered the Justice and Development Party's offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave. Early reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday. From around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in G√∂lba≈üƒ±, just outside of Ankara. The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured. T√ºrksat headquarters in G√∂lba≈üƒ± was also attacked, killing two security personnel. At around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul. At 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara. During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Kara≈ü to read out a statement saying that \\"the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government\\" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would \\"ensure the safety of the population.\\" The statement read in part: \\"Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged. [...] All international agreements are still valid. We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.\\" The plotters said they had \\"done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority\\". The statement also ordered temporary martial rule, and said a new constitution would be prepared \\"as soon as possible\\". TRT was then taken off air. Reuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as \\"well orchestrated,\\" and predicted that \\"given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.\\" Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and \\"taking it very seriously\\". The Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem K√∂se. = Government response and conflict = President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan Prime Minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoƒüan was on holiday inside Turkey and safe, and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy. A presidential source also said Erdoƒüan and his government were still in power. The first messages from Erdoƒüan were transmitted at around 00:23 At about 01:00, Erdoƒüan did a FaceTime interview with CNN T√ºrk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying \\"There is no power higher than the power of the people. Let them do what they will at public squares and airports.\\" Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu≈ü appeared on live television, saying Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government. The mayor of Ankara, Melih G√∂k√ßek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city's streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military. Erdoƒüan's plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atat√ºrk for the airport to be secured. His plane landed at 02:50 The First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a very small faction that were on the verge of being brought under control. Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled. There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara. Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being \\"neutralized\\". The channel went back on air and Kara≈ü, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint. By 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atat√ºrk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard. Tanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building. The parliamentary building was also hit from the air. Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge. A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet. There were also reports of pro- government jets flying over Ankara to \\"neutralize\\" helicopters used by those behind the coup. At 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament. At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country. However, at 03:12, Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down. It was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33. A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it. Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN T√ºrk's headquarters and forced the studio to go off air. After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN T√ºrk resumed its broadcast. Later, ƒ∞smail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers. At around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan's hotel. According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing. In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured. The Doƒüan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people that was attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup. = Shift in control of theatre of operations =  Soldiers' escape to Greece in helicopter  On Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport. The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian. Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non- commissioned officers). They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank. All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country. They were transferred to the local police station, while the helicopter was guarded at the airport by the Greek authorities. The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey. On 21 September 2016 Greece denied three out of the eight asylum. The men's lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the \\"impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.\\" On 11 October 2016 four more of the eight were denied asylum. Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re- evaluation but their applications were also rejected.  After Erdoƒüan's arrival in Istanbul  Citizens protesting the coup attempt in Kƒ±zƒ±lay Square After coup nightly demonstration of president Erdoƒüan supporters, Istanbul After Erdoƒüan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside. He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, \\"In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state. They cannot.\\" He blamed \\"those in Pennsylvania\\" (a reference to Fethullah G√ºlen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt. Erdoƒüan also said he had plans to \\"clean up\\" the army, saying that \\"This uprising is a gift from God to us.\\"\\"Turkish forces try to crush last remnants of coup after Erdoƒüan returns\\". Reuters. 16 July 2016. State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem K√∂se, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with G√ºlen, as the suspected leader of the coup. However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with G√ºlen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoƒüan's allegations against the movement were \\"highly irresponsible\\". G√ºlen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: \\"As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations.\\" Reuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have \\"crumbled\\" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it. Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul. It was reported that by 05:18, Atat√ºrk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender. Between 06:00‚Äì08:00 a skirmish took place there. In Akar's absence, √úmit D√ºndar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff. In the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police. According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers. Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the efforts of the police, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers. Meanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police. The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well. Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akƒ±ncƒ± Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-government forces.  Reasons for failure  One of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters' ranks. Turkey's National Intelligence Organization (Mƒ∞T) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule. One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt. Maj. √ñmer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels. These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner. The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks. Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals. The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of the true purpose of their mission, and became demoralized. Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators. The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General √úmit D√ºndar, personally called Erdoƒüan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoƒüan to land. The Mƒ∞T also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams. Equally important to the coup's failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoƒüan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them. A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before. Once Erdoƒüan landed at Atat√ºrk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), the coup was doomed. According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoƒüan's presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire. A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoƒüan's pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight. According to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media, and thus shape the narrative. Successful coups require that the mass media be controlled by the rebels. This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable. Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them, or at least not to resist. The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled. They failed to capture T√ºrksat, Turkey's main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country's television and mobile phone networks. This allowed Erdoƒüan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television. Other scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh's miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup. Luttwak's argument is that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces were not able to silence Erdoƒüan. Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn't control the message. Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it's their effect‚Äîcivil disobedience‚Äîthat is important. We might find that \\"[G√ºlen's movement] ... [might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,\\" writes Kinney. \\"... [A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.\\" Erdoƒüan wasn't censored (Luttwak's point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators' ability to project success (Singh's point). The end result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power. The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they \\"usually do not study extra- military reasons for coup failures/successes,\\" but rather put a premium on \\"the inner-workings of the [military] operation.\\" In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes. Pro-government forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt. Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters. While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case \\"to rally people\\". The coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised. Had the coup been launched at its original time in the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep and the streets would have been mostly empty. Reports have emerged, neither confirmed or denied by Russia or Turkey, that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup which were passed on to loyal Turkish operatives. The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to the coastal resort of Marmaris, where Erdoƒüan was staying, to capture or kill him. Pre-warned, Erdoƒüan left quickly to avoid them.  Aftermath  = Arrests and purges = General Akƒ±n √ñzt√ºrk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was reported as being the leader of the coup attempt. An extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoƒüan warning his opponents that \\"they will pay a heavy price for this.\\" The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist,After the coup, the counter-coup, 23 July 2016, The Economist described the purges as a \\"counter-coup\\", with the Times expecting the president to \\"become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,\\". As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country. 163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military's total. On 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to \\"suppress dissent\\". French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a \\"political system which turns away from democracy\\" in response to the purges. On 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup. On 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdaƒü said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested. Major General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai in connection with the failed coup. General Akƒ±n √ñzt√ºrk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attach√© to Israel. He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup. √ñzt√ºrk has denied the charges. General Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal √ñzt√ºrk, the commander of the Third Army, were also arrested.\\"Suspected Turkey Coup Leader Served as Military Attach√© to Israel\\". Haaretz. 16 July 2016. Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\\"Is Turkey abandoning NATO or vice versa? \\". Al-Monitor. 18 August 2016. In July 2018, Istanbul's 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison. On 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akƒ±n √ñzt√ºrk, former commander of Turkish Air Force, and the most senior officer involved in the coup. 128 people received \\"aggravated life\\" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences. = Turkish government statements about coup attempt =  Statements against Fethullah G√ºlen  Turkish authorities blamed Fethullah G√ºlen who condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it Fethullah G√ºlen, whom President Erdoƒüan said as being one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it. \\"I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,\\" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times. \\"Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force. I pray to God for Turkey, for Turkish citizens and for all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly. As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations.\\" President Erdoƒüan asked the United States to extradite G√ºlen: \\"I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt. Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey! If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.\\" Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support G√ºlen. Turkish Labor Minister S√ºleyman Soylu said that \\"America is behind the coup.\\" Regarding the AKP's statement against G√ºlen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government \\"to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,\\" before they would accept an extradition request. On 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: \\"The G√ºlen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of. They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier. I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013. It is very clear that significant segment of the bureaucracy in Turkey were infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement. That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous. It is highly likely that it led to the coup attempt.\\" Outside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-G√ºlen movement group 'Vuslat'. The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay. In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of G√ºlen supporters. People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium. Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered \\"the total closure of all activities\\" of an organization linked to the G√ºlen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country. On 2 August 2016, President Erdoƒüan said Western countries were \\"supporting terrorism\\" and the military coup, saying \\"I'm calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?\\" On 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the G√ºlen movement was responsible for the coup attempt. Duncan went on saying \\"the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey\\".  Statements against the U.S. and the West, and U.S. response  General Erdal √ñzt√ºrk (left), shown here with U.S. Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, right, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been arrested over reported involvement in a coup attempt. Vice President Joe Biden meets with Turkish President Erdoƒüan on 24 August 2016 In a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoƒüan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was \\"siding with coup plotters\\"; Erdoƒüan said the United States was protecting Fethullah G√ºlen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt. Turkish Prime Minister Binaldi Yildirim made similar comments. In response, Votel said that the Turkish government's statements were \\"unfortunate and completely inaccurate\\" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey. Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS. On 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoƒüan questioned Turkey's relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that \\"script\\" for the abortive putsch last month was \\"written abroad\\". Erdoƒüan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite G√ºlen to Turkey. When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric's guilt before extradition, to which Erdoƒüan said: \\"When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ... Let us put him on trial.\\" Yeni ≈ûafak daily, a Turkish pro-government newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the \\"mastermind\\" behind the coup attempt in Turkey. Campbell called the statement \\"absolutely ridiculous\\" and President Obama said \\"Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.\\" On 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup. A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup. Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup. = Incirlik Air Base = asylum to U.S.alt=255x255px The U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until \\"normal operations have been restored\\". They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off. The Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants. Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base. Twenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume. The Turkish commander of the air base, brig. Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested. After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from U.S. But his request was denied by U.S.https://armenpress.am/eng/news/854514.html Following the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable. = Social unrest = On 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanƒ± and Gazi. Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched. In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob. In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse. Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there. In Kadƒ±k√∂y, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists. = Calls to reintroduce the death penalty = Following the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting \\"we want the death penalty\\". President Erdoƒüan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that \\"in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.\\" Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union. European Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe's democratic principles. Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union \\"if it introduces the death penalty\\". Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey's accession talks with the European Union. Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership. The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms. As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty. = State of emergency = Vice President Joe Biden inspects damage to the Grand National Assembly during a visit to Ankara on 24 August 2016. On 20 July 2016, President Erdoƒüan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (\\"Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order\\").https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, \\"the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency\\", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval. The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115. The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People's Party and the Peoples' Democratic Party opposed it. Prime Minister Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to \\"get rid of this scourge rapidly\\". As part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmu≈ü announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (\\"war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation\\"). The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.  State of emergency extension  On 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu≈ü declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People's Party (CHP) and Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension. Following the National Security Council's recommendation for the extension President Erdoƒüan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu said that \\"The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup\\" and that it was \\"raising the prospect of opportunist measures.\\" The AKP's governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016. The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018. = Turkish military personnel and diplomats asylum bids =  Applications for asylum in Greece  On 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece's northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece. While The Turkish foreign minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu demanded extradition of \\"the eight traitors as soon as possible\\", the Greek authorities stated: \\"We will follow the procedures of international law. However, we give very serious considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.\\" The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter. The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons. On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety. On 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river. However, once they entered the country, the group split. The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum. They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis. The two men belonged to the Turkish navy, and the names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoƒüan himself. The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen. But there were no sign of the other three. According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey. Later, according to new evidences and new information these three ‚Äúarrested‚Äù marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.  Turkish attach√©s sortie from Greece to Italy  After the coup attempt, two Turkish military attaches in Athens, Staff Col. ƒ∞lhan Ya≈üƒ±tlƒ± and naval attache Col. Halis Tun√ß, had reportedly disappeared along with their families. The Greek foreign ministry cancelled the two attaches‚Äô accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry. Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy. On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.  Rear admiral's U.S. asylum application  On 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey's Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States- based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.  Asylum bids in Germany and Belgium  In mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium. In January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high- ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany. At the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt, the figure being a total for the period August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to Nato bases in Germany.Turkey coup: 136 diplomats and relatives seek Germany asylum BBC News, 24 February 2017.  Asylum bids in NATO countries  In November 2016, NATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted. He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide. He said: \\"Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ... As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.\\" As of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.  Diplomats asylum bids  Several Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland. = Torture reports = According to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured, and have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care. At least one has attempted suicide. Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions. A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee. \\"Let him die. We will say he came to us dead,\\" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying. Also, Erdoƒüan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees. Turkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdaƒü said on his Twitter account: \\"There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,\\" in response to reports by Amnesty International. \\"The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FET√ñ, one which is untrue and distorted,\\" = Anti-coup rally = On 7 August, more than a million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul. President Erdoƒüan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (CHP and MHP) were present. = Greece: Change in migration and asylum seeking =  Increase regarding Greek islands  Greek authorities on a number of Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup. At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced. Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup. The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability. Vincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.  Turkish civilians  On 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens were seeking asylum in Greece. A couple, both of whom are university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border. Also, three businessmen have illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum. On 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived to the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, along with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country. He told the Greek coast guard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by the government of President Tayyip Erdoƒüan. The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and, also, he transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings. The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status. On 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police. An academic and a teacher because they attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and other two because they organized the escape attempt. The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece. Before their attempt both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt. Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects. The court later ordered the release of the two while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested. On 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum. They told to the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and they were being persecuted by the Turkish government due to their political beliefs. On 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum. On 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, which was full with refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos. She requested political asylum. On 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt. More than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017. On 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, have requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island. In August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis. = Germany‚Äîand Turkish factions within = German-Turkish journalist Deniz Y√ºcel was imprisoned for espionage in February 2017 Berlin mayor, Michael M√ºller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the G√ºlen movement in Germany. He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to critically confront the G√ºlen movement in Berlin and, if necessary, to support measures against it. The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city. Der Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey's secret service (MIT) had asked Germany's foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up G√ºlen supporters in Germany. The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against G√ºlen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey. Also, Turkey's government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah G√ºlen in Germany. In Germany businesses thought to be in support of the G√ºlen movement have been harassed by Erdoƒüan supporters. After the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoƒüan. Erdoƒüan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns. Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression. German authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey's internal politics are spilling over into German cities. For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey's state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as Dƒ∞Tƒ∞B to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and G√ºlen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany. Dƒ∞Tƒ∞B manages some 900 mosques in Germany. G√ºlen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany. After the failed coup Dƒ∞Tƒ∞B published a sermon praising \\"our noble nation\\" for rising up against \\"a wretched network\\" that had sown \\"seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.\\" According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany's Bundestag, \\"That was not a religious text. It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoƒüan and his measures since the coup attempt,\\" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany's ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost. Solidarity Recital for Deniz Y√ºcel which took place in the Frankfurt, 21 May 2017 Germans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey's MIT spy agency. According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on \\"German Turks\\". Hans-Christian Str√∂bele told that there was an \\"unbelievable\\" level of \\"secret activities\\" in Germany by Turkey's MIT agency. According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large \\"army of agents\\" in the former West Germany: \\"Here, it's not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.\\" German lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.  Turkish civilians asylum bids  Germany's Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year. \\"We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,\\" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag. On 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany. As of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt. = Companies raided = Turkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah G√ºlen.

All suspects' assets were seized. = WikiLeaks = WikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents as a response to the Turkish government's purges that followed the coup attempt. In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website. On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP. WikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesised that Turkish authorities were responsible. WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, \\"our infrastructure is under sustained attack.\\" Tweets from WikiLeaks include \\"We are unsure of the true origin of the attack. The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies. We will prevail & publish.\\" and: \\"Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup.\\", \\"We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent\\"; \\"And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.\\" Upon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to \\"voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey's 81 provinces\\". = Renamed places = Several places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: * Boƒüazi√ßi K√∂pr√ºs√º (Bosphorus Bridge) ‚Üí 15 Temmuz ≈ûehitler K√∂pr√ºs√º * Kƒ±zƒ±lay Meydanƒ± ‚Üí 15 Temmuz Kƒ±zƒ±lay Demokrasi Meydanƒ± * Ahmet Taner Kƒ±≈ülalƒ± Meydanƒ± ‚Üí 15 Temmuz Milli ƒ∞rade Meydanƒ± (Reverted to original name a few days later) * B√ºy√ºk ƒ∞stanbul Otogarƒ± ‚Üí ƒ∞stanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarƒ± * In TRT, Yeni Haber St√ºdyosu ‚Üí 15 Temmuz Millet St√ºdyosu * Akƒ±ncƒ± Air Base ‚Üí M√ºrted Air Base * Kazan ‚Üí Kahramankazan * Niƒüde University ‚Üí Niƒüde √ñmer Halisdemir University In 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council has decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words, which could be associated with FET√ñ. = Restrictions on funeral services for coupists = The Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for \\"privates and low- ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything\\". = Reports of spying = A document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile G√ºlen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries. G√ºlen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports. Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries. Belgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary. German lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany. On 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attach√© of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying. Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah G√ºlen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities. The Dutch government called spying activities an \\"unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.\\" and the attach√© was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a \\"deportation warning\\" by Dutch authorities. = Requests for help from other countries = On 26 January 2017, President Erdoƒüan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah G√ºlen. = Museum = In April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoƒüan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the \\"Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy\\", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara. Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.President Erdoƒüan plans new museum dedicated to Turkey's failed coup  Third-party reactions  = Domestic = Among the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People's Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the H√ºrriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bah√ßeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m to express his opposition to the coup.Opposition parties reject the military coup attempt, H√ºrriyet Daily News (15 July 2016). The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was \\"under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.\\" Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party's Doƒüu Perin√ßek backed democracy, when he held G√ºlen and the Americans responsible. Kurdish militant separatist organization PKK, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an \\"enemy of humanity\\". = International = During the first hours of the coup plotters' moves of blocking ƒ∞stanbul's bridges and flying fighter jets low over ƒ∞stanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbj√∏rn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that \\"any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable\\". Russia's President Vladimir Putin called Erdoƒüan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries‚Äô heads following the coup attempt. Erdoƒüan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev ‚Äì who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt ‚Äì for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24Story of secret diplomacy that ended Russia-Turkey jet crisis, H√ºrriyet Daily News, 8 September 2016 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.\\"We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,\\" the PM said in a statement issued from his office. The majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint. On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements. Egyptian diplomats said that the council is \\"in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government ‚Äì or any other government for that matter ‚Äì as democratically elected or not\\". Objection by the United States and the UK ‚Äì permanent members of the Security Council ‚Äì led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to \\"respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law\\", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council. The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt. Al-Monitor reported that \\"Unlike Ankara's Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup's failure to speak up. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing \\"Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount\\". In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoƒüan the coup attempt was \\"a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.\\"Will failed coup push Erdoƒüan toward Iran, Russia? . Al-Monitor. 20 July 2016. Mustafa Akƒ±ncƒ±, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that \\"no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.\\" Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department. European Commissioner dealing with Turkey's EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey's government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act. President Barack Obama talks on the phone in the Oval Office with John Kerry regarding the situation in Turkey, 15 July 2016 On 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoƒüan: \\"The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey. The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct and investigation to determine exactly what happened.\\" On 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: \\"Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ... I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.\\"\\"NATO chief says Turkey's military still strong despite detentions\\". Reuters. 20 July 2016. On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey's democratic institutions. He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters. On 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey's president Erdoƒüan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey. On 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt. Dunford said: \\"The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship ‚Äì the need for us to cooperate.\\"  Greek maritime patrols for coup fugitives  On July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece. These reports put the Greek armed forces on alert. Also, the Greek Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datca, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters. Furthermore, a contingent of the Greek Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there. Athens had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and so took the reports seriously. In addition, Turkish F-16 fighter jets were scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean. Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have \\"hijacked\\" a vessel to flee to Greece. The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.  Causes  According to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoƒüan had himself to blame for the coup. Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoƒüan had reportedly \\"dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.\\" After \\"fanning the flames\\" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey \\"into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.\\" The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoƒüan's foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial \\"no problems with neighbors\\" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends. British Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that \\"too late did Erdoƒüan realise the cost of the role he had chosen for his country. It's one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.\\" Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expects another to follow in the months or years to come. Turkish professor Akƒ±n √únver described the coup d'√©tat attempt as \\"more of a mutiny\\". = Peace at Home Council = The name of the \\"Peace at Home Council\\" ‚Äì Yurtta Sulh Konseyi ‚Äì is derived from Atat√ºrk's famous saying 'Peace at Home, Peace in the World'. Journalist Ezgi Ba≈üaran said that \\"the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's famous address to the Turkish Youth. [...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a G√ºlenist one.\\" The citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people. The messages were cross referenced with video footage. The group was named ‚ÄúYurtta sulh‚Äù which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to G√ºlen or anything related during the several hours of messaging. News reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil √ñks√ºz. Some believe √ñks√ºz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence. = Timing = German Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt. According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet ≈ûƒ±k, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoƒüan. According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt, before they would be disposed and arrested. = Staged coup reports = During and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it. The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt. Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a 'tragic comedy' and 'theatre play'. Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoƒüan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimise further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general. Other elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the highly visible nature of the coup actions. Fethullah G√ºlen, whom Erdoƒüan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, \\"I don't believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoƒüan. There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the G√ºlenists].\\" Journalist Cengiz √áandar, a veteran observer of Turkey's coups, said \\"I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.\\" Prominent Hizmet (G√ºlen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoƒüan prior to 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within \\"the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn't actually happen. There were events that did happen, but by the time that the document started, those events didn't happen. It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.\\"  Evidence of pre-planning  The organisation and spontaneous synchronisation by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how the call to prayer could have been strategically used by Erdoƒüan to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism. Thousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16‚Äì18 July 2016. The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the \\"Turkish government had all those lists ready\\", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016. Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the \\"event was prepared\\" and the lists were to be used \\"at a certain stage\\".  Possible connections of the coup leaders to Erdoƒüan  Mehmet Di≈üli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar's neck to make him sign, is the brother of ≈ûaban Di≈üli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoƒüan.  Possible government motives  A number of social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents. Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that \\"the coup was staged to give Erdoƒüan an opportunity to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country\\". Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a \\"fake coup\\" which would help a \\"fake democracy warrior\\" (referring to Erdoƒüan). The source said: \\"Probably we'll see an early election [in] which he'll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes. And this will probably guarantee another 10‚Äì15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.\\" The New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoƒüan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power. Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which‚Äîamong other factors‚Äîraised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties. Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government. Politicians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a 'civil coup' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated G√ºlen supporters by the government shortly after the events. Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic. Justice Minister Bekir Bozdaƒü said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: \\"Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre. Public prosecutors are already investigating them. Most of them are losers who think it is an honour to die for Fethullah G√ºlen's command.\\"The Independent, Turkey Coup: Authorities investigate those claiming attempted takeover was a hoax On 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Hizmet movement that tracks Turkey, published a controversial 181-pages report stating that the coup bid was in fact orchestrated by President Erdogan as a false flag in order to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria. According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt. The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan. = Allegations of CIA involvement = In early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt. Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council. The prosecutor's office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt. H√ºrriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller's location before the attempted coup and afterwards when he left Turkey. Barkey denied his reported role in the coup, stating, \\"These accusations are so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term 'science fiction'.\\"  Important people  * Hulusi Akar * √úmit D√ºndar * Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan * Hande Fƒ±rat * Fethullah G√ºlen * √ñmer Halisdemir * Tijen Kara≈ü * Akƒ±n √ñzt√ºrk * Semih Terzi * Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m  See also  * Deep state in Turkey * The Imam's Army * List of coups d'√©tat and coup attempts since 2010 * List of modern conflicts in the Middle East  References   Further reading  *  External links  * Updates at BBC News * Updates at The Telegraph * Updates at CNN * Updates at Al Jazeera * Updates at The Wall Street Journal * Updates at The New York Times * July 15: A Night of Defiance.

The foundation in New York was originally led by Ruth Field, the widow of the first Foundation‚Äôs creator Marshall Field III. It focused on enacting social change on a more national scale than the Illinois foundation. The New York foundation has a history of supporting racial equality, researching hunger in the United States, and improving the lives of those stuck in poverty. It finally spent itself out of existence in 1989.  Original Field Foundation The Field Foundation was originally established by Marshall Field III, the grandson of a well-known Chicago merchant who founded the famous Marshall Field's department store, in 1940. It was founded in New York to help victims of the Great Depression, and it supported the ideas and methods of the President Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal. Its board was composed of various business leaders, social scientists, judges, and scholars. The Foundation assisted other organizations supporting social change, civil rights, and child welfare, and also offered grants to groups such as the American Council on Race Relations, Provident Medical Associates in Chicago, and the Research Center for Human Relations in New York. By 1949, the Foundation‚Äôs assets totaled 11 million dollars and it offered grants of 150,000 dollars per year. Field III died in 1956, after which the organization started splitting due to different goals its members had. Field‚Äôs son Marshall Field IV desired that the organization focus its efforts locally within Chicago, where most of the Foundation‚Äôs assets lay. Field‚Äôs widow Ruth Field wished for the organization to expand its efforts nationally and promote social change. In 1960, the organization split into the Field Foundation of Illinois and the Field Foundation of New York.  Accomplishments of the Field Foundation of New York = Under Hahn= The Field Foundation has a long history with various social movements. It was originally directed by Maxwell Hahn, under which it supported racial integration in the South in the 1950s, leading larger foundations after it. It was also one of the first supporters of black education campaigns, and focused heavily on child welfare and racial issues under Hahn. = Under Dunbar= In 1965, Leslie W. Dunbar, director of the Southern Regional Council, succeeded Hahn and moved the organization‚Äôs focus more on those struggling from poverty and minority groups. In 1967 its examination of the state of poor Southern communities led to an expansion of food stamp and school lunch programs. It also pushed for the recognition of black lung disease, being among the first to do so. In 1970‚Äôs the organization under Dunbar started to examine federal activities more closely, studying surveillance, arms programs, and civil liberties violations. Examples include the organization since 1972 donating $1,073,800 to the Center for Defense Information, a federal oversight organization that examines Defense spending and priorities. It was the largest funder of the organization. It also helped to save the Food Research and Action Center when its federal funds were cut under President Nixon in 1973. This led to disagreements within the organization over the government‚Äôs policies and affirmative action, eventually followed by Dunbar‚Äôs resignation in 1967. = Under Boone= In 1980, American philanthropist Richard W. Boone became the director of the Foundation. Boone also believed in government oversight through independent organization. Under him, the Field Foundation funded the Study Group on Social Security, an organization monitoring Government reductions of benefits to the elderly, disabled, widows, and orphans. The Foundation became one of the earliest supporters of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in 1981, offering $175,000 in its first year and $150,000 in the second. Boone‚Äôs policies led the organization to support black voter registration programs, US resettlement of IndoChina refugees, funded the Communications Consortium Media Center, and researched hunger in the US. The organization purposefully spent itself out of existence in 1989, choosing to empower other social activism groups to continue its legacy.

It contains a reconstruction of a large Viking Age settlement and a \\"viking reservation\\", and visitors participate in living history reenactments; it also performs research and functions as the municipal museum of Vellinge Municipality and part of Fotevikens Kulturcenter, a group of cultural facilities on the peninsula. History The museum grew out of the archaeological investigation of sunken viking ships in Foteviken Bay and local interest in the Battle of Fotevik, which was fought there on 4 June 1134. A group headed by Bj√∂rn M. Buttler Jakobsen formed a foundation called SVEG (Scandinavian Viking Explorer Group) in 1987. In 1993, the foundation started planning to open a maritime museum;Roeland Paardekooper, The Value of an Archaeological Open-Air Museum Is in Its Use: Understanding Archaeological Open-Air Museums and Their Visitors, Leiden: Sidestone, 2012, , p. 189. in 1995, after changing their focus towards Viking Age living history, they opened Foteviken Museum, with Jakobsen as its director.Jan Samuelsson, \\"Leva som en viking lockar\\", Sydsvenskan, 16 March 2015 .Elin Wrethov, \\"Vikingakung trivs n√§r han f√•r ber√§tta\\", Sydsvenskan, 29 April 2015 . At the in Malm√∂, the group built two replica viking cogs; in 2014 the city sold these and the harbour site where they are located is now a medieval-themed tourist area called Medeltidsriket Malm√∂ya. Facilities and programmes Typical turf houses in Foteviken with lookout castle in the background The museum occupies an approximately site on H√∂llviken Bay. In addition to a reconstruction of a large Viking Age settlement, the 'Viking Reserve', there are research and handicrafts buildings and three large halls, including a restaurant seating up to 200 and a feast hall. The gate to the reserve is indicated on the museum map as a \\"border gate\\" between Sweden and the reserve.Paardekooper, pp. 189, 191‚Äì92.

The reserve opens for the summer season on May Day, and is intended as a recreation of a large settlement late in the Viking Age, during the transition to the Scandinavian Middle Ages and the increasing influence of Christianity in the North. This enables the museum to include the Battle of Fotevik, which clearly belongs to the medieval period. Those staying in the reserve live as Viking Age people and are not permitted to have modern equipment or wear modern clothing.Mats Amnell, \\"S√• anv√§nds en v√∂lvestav!\\", Sydsvenskan, 28 June 2016 .

Biography  Vieillard was the son of Antoine Vieillard de Boismartin, a lawyer at the Parlement of Rouen, then mayor of Saint-L√¥, known for his beautiful and generous defense of the Verdure family (1780-1789), earning him the direct praise of Louis XVI, to whom he was introduced, and a kind of civic ovation in the midst of the National Constituent Assembly, during the session of January 30, 1790. A payor at the Treasure (1806), Royal censor (1820-1824), director of the mayors' newspaper (1822-1824), literary critic by the Moniteur universel et officiel, director and chief curator of the biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal, then librarian at the Senate in 1854, where he succeeded Paul- Mathieu Laurent, Vieillard began early in the dramatic career. He produced no less than 30 plays, 24 of which were presented in different theaters, such as the Op√©ra, the Op√©ra-Comique, the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais and the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville. The verve he spent in these various works, where he worked with Armand Gouff√©, Georges Duval, Ren√© de Chazet, Dumersan, Jules Merle and Joseph Pain, did not prevent him to exploit the literary criticism which asked for more seriousness and a more complete maturity of mind on his part. Vieillard published in several newspapers, mainly in the former Moniteur universel, many articles that reflected the breadth and variety of his knowledge. He also became one of the principal editors of the Encyclop√©die des gens du monde, where he was specially commissioned to write biographies about famous men of the French Revolution. Well versed in the history of that time, which he lived, the moderation of his opinions and the uprightness of his character let him naturally assess accurately the events and actors. Thus he could believe he was authorized to contribute the Le Moniteur Universel a series of studies on the ' by Lamartine, a work interrupted by the Revolution of 1848. Vieillard also had in the highest degree a feeling for music ; the last pamphlets he published in 1855 at the age of 78, testify of the passion of this dilettante. M√©hul, Madame Scio, Vicissitudes d‚Äôun librettiste de l‚Äôancien op√©ra are the titles of these curious and interesting studies reproduced by le M√©nestrel. Vieillard was particularly clever at finding a musical theme in a dramatic situation or a legend. At various occasions, the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts asked him seven cantatas. Only one was crowned and executed at the solemn session of the prize at the Institut in 1845. This time, the poet and the musician had drawn their inspirations in the ballad of Imogine, borrowed from the Monk by Matthew Gregory Lewis. Vieillard married Ana√Øs-Henriette Formey Saint-Louvent (16 February 1802, Saint-L√¥ ‚Äì 16 November 1873, Versailles) 29 March 1826. He was made a chevalier of the Order of The Lily in 1814 and of the ordre royal de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1815, and was also a member of the acad√©mies de Caen and Cherbourg.

Plot  A man named Bob Bellings rapes a woman in her apartment, then fatally bludgeons her with an ashtray. The next day, Bob goes to work at his office, where he watches a newscast in which a psychiatric expert explains that women should not resist being sexually assaulted, as that is what most predators want, and that 89% of surveyed women admitted to wanting to be raped at least once in their lives. One of Bob's fellow employees (who are all female) later teases him in a sexual manner, which prompts Bob into going out for his break, during which he stalks and has sex with a woman. Bob returns to work and watches another newscast, which announces that the government will be issuing requisition cards that authorized citizens can take to gun shops and exchange for side arms. After another encounter with his promiscuous coworker, Bob leaves work, rents a car, and attempts to rape another woman, who responds by stabbing him in the leg with a pair of scissors. When the woman tries to escape, Bob uses his car to knock hers off of the road and into a house, causing a fiery explosion. Bob then goes home and masturbates into a coffee cup, which he tricks the employee who had been taunting him into drinking from. Bob proceeds to turn his requisition card in for a handgun, which the overzealous clerk provides explosive \\"fragmentation ammo\\" for. Upon leaving the munitions shop, Bob snatches a young girl from a playground, and eats candy with her in the woods before dropping her off at her house. Afterward, Bob practices with his gun, and picks up and has sex with a female hitchhiker, who at one point rides the gear shift of Bob's rental car (which Bob later returns, sans the gear shift's knob). Bob is subsequently mugged, and then taken hostage by a trio of bank robbers, who decide to execute him. Bob uses his fragmentation rounds to kill the thieves before shooting down a police helicopter and escaping in a hijacked car. The film ends with Bob going to an airport and reuniting with his wife and daughter, who were away on a trip. When his wife asks him what he has been up to in her absence, Bob replies, \\"Oh, you know nothing ever happens in this shit town\\".

Reception  Jack Stevenson, the author of Scandinavian Blue: The Erotic Cinema of Sweden and Denmark in the 1960s and 1970s, noted that the film was \\"even more bizarre\\" than Thriller ‚Äì A Cruel Picture, and was \\"tasteless, violent, pornographic and some would certainly say misogynist - all meant no doubt to reflect the sickness endemic in society at large\\". Daniel Ekeroth, author of Swedish Sensationsfilms: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema, similarly categorized Breaking Point as \\"completely crazy\\" and \\"one of the sickest and slowest films ever made\\". In a review written for Trash Cinema: A Celebration of Overlooked Masterpieces, Michael Harris opined that the film \\"creates a fantastic sense of insecurity\\" and is \\"a wonderful achievement in simplicity and confrontationalism without being confrontational\\".

Dragon silk combines the elasticity and strength of spider silk. It has the tensile strength as high as 1.79 gigapascals (as much as 37%) and the elasticity above 38% exceeding the maximum reported features of the spider silk. It is reported that dragon silk is more flexible than the Monster silk and stronger than the \\"Big Red, recombinant spider silk designed for increased strength. Properties = Mechanical properties = Dragon silk has properties higher than that of any other fiber ever noticed. Tensile Strength In comparison, Dragon silk's tensile strength is higher than the alloy steel(450-2000 MPa's). In a report it is said that the strength of Dragon silk is as high as 1.79 Gpa's which is 37% higher than the widely reported spider silk. Its tensile strength is higher than the \\"Big Red silk,\\" which had been reported as the strongest fiber ever made. \\"Bid Red Silk\\" was developed in the same Laboratories as Dragon Silk. Flexibility Dragon silk is far more flexible than Kevlar(the material used by US Army to develop body armor). Its flexibility is 38% higher than normal Spider silk and is noticeably more flexible than the \\"Monster silk\\" from the same lab. In percentage, Kevlar's flexibility is 3% and Dragon silk's flexibility is 30% to 40%. History In 2010, the scientists discovered the first spider silk, which was a great achievement, as it is one of the strongest natural fiber. But the problem was that spiders are cannibalistic and territorial, so it is impossible to create a cost-effective spider farm. To overcome this problem, scientists at Kraig Labs developed a method for making spider silk from silkworms. In 2011, Malcolm J. Fraser, Donald L. Jarvis and their colleagues published a study in which they describe how they remove silkworm silk making protein and replaced it with the spiders protein to built unique forms of silkworms, which they call \\"super silkworms\\", that can spin composite spider silk.

Biography  Born to a middle-class family, he received his primary education at home. Around the age of twelve, he taught himself to paint and worked as an assistant to the local icon painters.New Biographical Information @ the Belarusian National Arts Museum. He was twenty before he had lessons from a professional artist; Thomas Hesse (1807-c.1870), a Baltic- German painter from Vilnius who had settled in Slutsk to become an art teacher at the gymnasium. After 1830, he lived in Oryol and, in 1835, presented his portraits of local notables at an exhibition given by the Imperial Academy. The following year, he was able to begin auditing classes at the Academy, but he had insufficient means to pursue his studies there, failed to find financial support, and was forced to quit. Nevertheless, in 1839, he was awarded the title of \\"Free Artist\\". That same year, he enlisted as an artist with the 12th Russian Spiritual Mission to China; arriving in Beijing in 1840. He remained there for only three years; having to leave before his contract expired, due to illness. His only known work on a Chinese theme is a view of a country palace near the city, painted in 1860 and preserved at the Russian Museum. He returned by way of Irkutsk, where he lived for several years, where he was engaged to paint portraits of the local officials, then settled in Saint Petersburg in 1846 after being dismissed. In 1854, he was named an \\"Academician\\". He provided icons for the church in the new Russian Consulate at Hakodate in 1861....On the other Seminarian Joseph: blog on the Hakodate mission @ LiveInternet. He also participated in decorating the Cathedral of St. Mary Magdalene, Warsaw, which opened in 1869. In the 1870s, he began to suffer from an eye disease and, through the intercession of Grigory Gagarin and Fyodor Bruni, was awarded a state pension. Little is known of him beyond that point. He is last mentioned as a homeowner in a document from the National Historical Archive of Belarus, dated 1883.

The film is based on the young adult novel of the same name written by Megan Shull and is written by Charlie Shahnaian and Shari Simpson and directed by Jay Karas. The movie stars Peyton List and Jacob Bertrand.  Plot  High school sophomores Jack Malloy (Jacob Bertrand) and Ellie O‚ÄôBrien (Peyton List) are both going through hard times. Jack‚Äôs mother has recently died, leaving him with his roughhousing older brothers and cold, seemingly heartless dad, who puts pressure on his sons to be macho men, all fighting, no crying. Ellie‚Äôs own dad has walked out on her and her ‚Äúhelicopter‚Äù mom, and her best friend since kindergarten, Sassy, has started ignoring her in favor of the more feminine yet nastier new girl, Aspen. Both have big sports events coming up over the weekend. Jack is trying out for the varsity hockey team, but has to deal with the bullying Porter who has always lost the last spot on varsity to one of Jack‚Äôs brothers. Ellie‚Äôs rhythmic gymnastics team has to win big at the upcoming tournament, eke budgets cuts at school will have them demoted from ‚Äúteam‚Äù to ‚Äúclub‚Äù. On Friday, they both end up in the nurse‚Äôs office, after Jack is hurt in a scuffle with Porter, and Ellie starts crying after hearing Aspen say mean things about her to Sassy behind her back. They start fighting, with Ellie saying boys have it better than girls without having to deal with friend drama, and Jack saying girls have it easier because they can be as emotional as they want. The tired nurse gets them to continue their fighting via text, and they text each other saying how they wished they had each other lives. Suddenly, magic lightning strikes and knocks them out, and when they get up, they realize they swapped bodies. Ellie remembers something her mom said about how ‚Äúinvesting too much emotional energy into an object gives it power over you.‚Äù In this case, their respective cell phones, which they cherished because each had once belonged to their now absent parent, had the power to grant their texted wish. After failing to swap back, they decide to look for a book belonging to Ellie‚Äôs mom to reverse the spell. But they find out their time is limited when it‚Äôs revealed that Ellie‚Äôs dad will be canceling their family phone plan, effective on Sunday.

Headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, USA, Tritek specializes in custom designed hardware and software for mail processing equipment and imaging solutions. Tritek has many patents in mail sorting and processing. Tritek provides machinery and services to Fortune 500 financial companies such as J P Morgan Chase Bank. Washington state, Sedgwick County, Kansas, and Harris County, Texas use Tritek's vote-by-mail technology for processing mailed-in ballots during elections. Tritek's assembly plant is in Wilmington, Delaware where the company also operates a mail processing center. Tritek is a global company providing products and services to European countries, Fortune 500 companies, universities, presort mail businesses, and many US government postal operations. Tritek is a multi-million dollar privately owned company. Tritek has worked with well-known organizations such as Siemens, the United States Postal Service, and Lockheed Martin. History Tritek's sister company, Independent Computer Services (ICS), was established as a mail sorting machine service company for Canadian-based Leigh Marsland Mail Sorting Equipment in 1981. In 1984, ICS purchased the worldwide rights to Leigh Mail Sorting Technology. ICS eventually developed their own reader and computer systems to replace aging components in the legacy equipment. ICS developed an optical character reader (OCR) and named it the Model 88-5. This reader was used to presort mail on Leigh Instrument (Canada) mail sorting machines. ICS named the development company of the 88-5 Tritek Technologies. This name was derived from the three technologies used in mail sortation: conveying, computing and sorting. In 1988, Tritek introduced the first multi-font programmable optical reader for mail processing machines. Tritek developed the first high-speed flats sorter in 1991 and named it the 91-5 Ultrasorter. The United States Postal Service tested the 91-5 under their FMBCS (flat mail barcode sorter) development project as a high speed flats sorter replacement. The Postal Service licensed Tritek's technology which is still in use today. In 2003 Tritek developed \\"Rule Editor\\" software that sorts mail according to a custom programmed set of software rules tied to a database. This software allows organizations to sort generically addressed inbound mail pieces, handle ad mail, or forward mail to a different address. Since 2009 Tritek Technologies has been known for handling undeliverable mail pieces the post office has returned to the sender. Returned mail often features marked-up address blocks, stickers, and stamps that obscure original addressing information making this material difficult to process with automated equipment. Partners Cambridge Corporate Services uses Tritek automated mail sorting machines to internally handle high volumes of mail. Tritek has provided mail sorting equipment to Canon Facilities Management Services and Brightkey.
