Born in Berlin, he was originally intended by his father to study theology. Instead, he was enrolled at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin.Walker, 6:page cit. pending. There he studied harmony and composition with Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen, director of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. In 1843, he became a church organist of Invalidenhaus, Berlin, also writing his first symphony plus a Zigeunerpolka for orchestra the same year. The latter was arranged for piano by Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt.Searle, 4:663. Conradi held various conducting appointments; these included Stettin (1849), Berlin (1850), D√ºsseldorf (1852), and Cologne (1853), then Berlin again at such theaters as Kroll's, the Wallner-Theater and the Victoria- Theater.Walker, 6:page cit needed. Conradi probably met Liszt in the early 1840s. He served as Liszt's copyist in Weimar in January and February 1844, and he spent 18 months there in 1848 and 1849 at Liszt's instigation. Conradi prepared copies of the initial versions of Liszt's orchestral works, making suggestions on scoring. He also assisted Liszt in assembling a \\"Programme general\\" of all the repertory he had played during his virtuoso years.Walker, 6:Page cit. needed. While Conradi was an extremely hard worker, he also possessed a somewhat routine mind. When he received his appointment as Kapellmeister in Stettin in the winter of 1849, his work at Weimar was taken over by the more imaginative Joachim Raff. Nevertheless, Liszt continued to use him as a copyist. In September, 1855 Liszt wrote of his intention to send the score of his Psalm 13 to Berlin so that Conradi could make a fair copy for the first performance there. The extent of Conradi's help with Liszt's early orchestration has been well documented by Liszt scholar Peter Raabe, who demonstrated that, whatever the position regarding initial drafts, the final versions were always Liszt's own.Walker, 6:page cit. needed. Conradi wrote eight operas, a ballet, five symphonies, overtures, and string quartets as well as dance music, songs, vaudeville sketches, farces and potpourris (which were performed in garden concerts for many years).

He sang and wrote in both German and English, in a recording career that spanned more than three decades. Early life L√§mmerhirt was born in Adlershof, East Berlin. Following the arrest of his father for alleged spying in 1957, his mother fled to West Berlin with L√§mmerhirt and his two sisters. They eventually settled in Schlachtensee, Berlin. His father joined the family in West Berlin when L√§mmerhirt was 12 years old, but became violent and drunken; L√§mmerhirt believed that experience gave him, in adult life, a strong aversion to violence and injustice which influenced his songwriting. He took up the harmonica and bought his first guitar ‚Äì a 12 string ‚Äì when he was 16. Rock and blues clubs were springing up over Berlin in the mid-1960s and Werner picked up playing tips in these. In 1967 he dropped out of school and, accompanied by just his guitar and a sleeping bag, set out to travel around Scandinavia, England and the Netherlands. For 3 years he travelled around Europe, spending the winters back in Berlin, doing whatever work was available, to finance his next trip. His influences at this time were, to begin with, mainstream performers such as the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Donovan. Later, influences were legendary blues artists such as Big Bill Broonzy and Mississippi John Hurt. At the end of the 1960s, British-style folk clubs had become very popular in Berlin, and L√§mmerhirt decided to return to the city where he would spend the day busking in S-bahn stations and the evening playing in folk clubs. Early career During this time he met Hannes Wader, who invited him to collaborate with him in making an album, \\"Ich hatte mir noch so viel vorgenommen\\". The success of this album led to L√§mmerhirt accompanying Wader on tours ‚Äì his first assignment as a professional musician. Werner collaborated with Wader on three further albums. Solo career L√§mmerhirt worked as a session musician at this time with artists such as Tom Paxton, Eddie and Finbar Furey and Alex Campbell. In the winter of 1973‚Äì74, L√§mmerhirt was approached with a proposal to record his first solo album on a new label, Stockfisch Records. This album, Ten Thousand Miles, was successful and it led to further and larger live performances. L√§mmerhirt began to write his own songs at this time, and his second solo album was released in 1975. L√§mmerhirt continued to tour in Germany and released his most recent CD in 2007.

Located in Grass Valley, California and a part of the Nevada County Library System, it is open Tuesday through Saturday. History Plaque added in 2005 at the library's entrance when it was renamed in honor of Josiah Royce There were several early attempts to establish a library in the California Gold Rush town of Grass Valley. The first was in 1860, followed by another in 1869, but neither survived. The Emmanuel Episcopal Church was established in Grass Valley in 1858, but it wasn't until 1901 that the non-denominational Emmanuel Church Library opened to provide library services to \\"the Atheist and the Buddhist if such there be\\". A decade later, the city became the library's governing body. It requested a Carnegie grant in 1914 and received $15,000 the following year. The chosen building site, at 207 Mill Street, near the intersection of Mill and Neal Street, had been the birthplace and early home of philosopher Josiah Royce. In 2005, the library, now a branch of the county library system, was renamed to honor Royce. Structure San Francisco architect William Sebastian Mooser was selected over William Weeks to design the new library. The builders were Welch Bros. and Hannemann from Oakland who also built the Gridley Carnegie Library. The building is of Neoclassical architecture (also known as \\"classical revival\\" style).

Vironniemi is the location of the Presidential Palace, the Palace of the Finnish Council of State, the Senate Square, the Helsinki Cathedral, the Uspenski Cathedral and the main office of the Bank of Finland. Other important sites in the district include the main building of the University of Helsinki, the Helsinki City Hall, the Helsinki Central railway station and the Helsinki main post office. Many banks and corporations have their headquarters in Vironniemi, and the Sokos and Stockmann department stores and Sanomatalo, the main office of Helsingin Sanomat, Finland's largest newspaper, are also found there. A part of the core of Finland's cultural life is also found here: the National Library of Finland, the Finnish National Theatre, Ateneum, Kiasma and the Helsinki Music Centre. History Originally, a narrow bay called Kluuvinlahti extended south of T√∂√∂l√∂nlahti, reaching the site of present-day Esplanadi. At that time, the name Vironniemi meant the area eastwards of the bay mentioned above. The birth of the Helsinki centre today dates back to 1640. At that time, the city centre was moved to Vironniemi from its birthplace at the mouth of the Vantaa river, the location of the present-day district of Vanhakaupunki. The city grew and developed. It can still be seen: Old buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th century form about a quarter of the buildings currently in the district. Still in the 1850s, construction of the city was mainly focused in the Vironniemi area and south of it. When the Kluuvinlahti bay was gradually filled in the 19th century, the name Vironniemi was disused in all except historical contexts. Only in the 1980s the name was restored, as the name of the main district, when division of the city into main districts was established. Districts and neighbouring districts of Vironniemi The main district of Vironniemi is divided into three individual districts: Kruununhaka, Kluuvi and Katajanokka. Neighbouring districts include Kaartinkaupunki in the Ullanlinna main district to the south, Kamppi and Etu- T√∂√∂l√∂ in the Kampinmalmi main district to the west, Siltasaari across the Pitk√§silta bridge in the Kallio main district to the north, and S√∂rn√§inen to the east of the aforementioned district across the more eastern Hakaniemi bridge. Office and home to thousands Vironniemi is a very important employer (35,040 offices, as of 31 December 2003) and also the home of 11,242 Helsinkians (as of early 2005). Over 80% of the district's apartments have been built before 1960, and a little over 10% in the 1980s,Helsinki by districts (2005): Basic information about the main district of Vironniemi when production of new apartments was being directed towards Katajanokka. The education level of the inhabitants of the district is the highest of all main districts in the city - 36.4% of the inhabitants have a university degree. 10.6% of the district's inhabitants are native Swedish-speaking (as of 1 January 2005), which is clearly higher than the city average. The unemployment rate is very low and the income level is above average. Traffic connections in the district are excellent. Vironniemi is the endpoint or transit point of many tram, bus, train and ferry routes. Two of the stations of the Helsinki metro - the Rautatientori metro station and the Kaisaniemi metro station are located in the area. Traffic routes - streets, the rail yard and the piers - have taken up about 45% of the land area of the core of the city centre.

Its English title is The Head of Barcelona. The sculpture was Lichtenstein's first outdoor work using ceramic tile. It is said to acknowledge Antoni Gaud√≠ and Barcelona's affinity for mosaics. The sculpture stands tall on the waterfront in the heart of the city. Made out of concrete and ceramic, it is an abstract rendition of a woman's head and appears exactly how one would expect a Lichtenstein sculpture to be. Lichtenstein did not start experimenting with three-dimensional art until the late 1970s, and prior to this his main focus was on pop art. He mainly painted on large canvases and his paintings resembled comic-strip art; his signature use of bold primary colors, thick dark lines, thought bubbles containing context and sound effects, and dots used as a method of shading, can be seen in most of his works from 1961 and later, starting with his painting Look Mickey. Although it is very abstract, it is clear that the sculpture was made to resemble the head and face of a woman. It is made up of thick pieces of concrete completely covered in red, yellow, blue, black and white mosaic tiles, and from far away it looks like it could be a painting. The woman's eyes look like thick blue and black brush strokes; same with her nose, and her lips look like Lichtenstein could have used a quick stroke of bright red paint. The left third of her face, the side with the blue nose and eye, is covered with white tiles, while the right two thirds of her face is covered in a grid of red dots, typical of Lichtenstein's pop-art style. Lichtenstein added other artistic elements to this sculpture as well. Below her head, what would probably be considered the woman's neck, is a tall, flat stroke of blue and white that extends all the way up through her face and ends a few inches above her head. Perpendicular to the blue and white stroke is a stroke of yellow and black, beginning at the bottom and then reappearing at the top of her head. Similar to his sculptures from the early eighties, specifically his Brushstrokes pieces, the entire sculpture looks like it could have been painted with a few quick strokes of paint. The difference between these earlier pieces and The Head of Barcelona is that his Brushstrokes pieces are created with painted aluminum while The Head is his only piece made out of concrete and covered in mosaic tiles. The reason for this difference in his sculptures is because The Head of Barcelona was built to resemble the style of Antoni Gaudi, a Catalan architect who is famous for employing organic lines and mosaic tiles throughout his architecture, and for which Barcelona is known.

It was built in 1883 at 1800 Park Avenue for its first owner, Charles Bardwell, and its original plan was in the Queen Anne style. In 1890 its second owner, Emil Ferrant, had the house remodeled in the Moorish Revival style that was popular at the time. Norwegian-born architect Carl F. Struck added two onion domed towers, a wraparound porch with spindlework columns, ogee arches, and deep-toned stained glass windows. The house was later moved to its present location at 2500 Portland Ave. S. in 1898 to make way for a bank building. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It was nominated based on it being a locally significant example of the late 19th-century interest in exotic revival architecture. Architect Carl Struck was the only Norwegian-born architect who practiced this style in Minneapolis. Struck was also responsible for designing Dania Hall in 1885, which was listed on the National Register in 1974 but destroyed by fire in 2000. There were few buildings originally built in the Moorish Revival style; the usual practice was to apply these forms to structures built in simpler styles. The Bardwell-Ferrant house is an unusually picturesque representative of this practice, making it locally significant. In 1986 partners Mary Lou Maxwell and Jean Steward bought the house and renovated it, subdividing it into four apartments. At the time, the house was structurally sound, but significant mechanical work was required, including new heating, electrical, and plumbing systems. Thieves had also stolen some of the stained glass windows and tile from the fireplace mantels. After the renovation, three of the four apartments had two stories, and all were outfitted with new appliances. Much of the siding on the exterior was replaced, and it was repainted in a mauve color (the Victorian term for this color was \\"ashes of roses\\"). The trim was painted in a cream color, and the pressed metal trim on the towers was painted with other colors to complement the stained glass windows. The home was sold again in 2001 and later fell into foreclosure. In 2011 a new owner purchased the home with an eye toward restoring the house to a single family home. During the period of foreclosure the home suffered from vandalism and damage including structural issues, several fireplace mantels that had been pried away from the walls, damage to several of the stained glass windows and theft of some of the home's copper pipe and wiring.

Produced by Jeremy Thomas, it stars Ryan Phillippe, Eva Green and Sam Riley. Shooting took place in London in the fourth quarter of 2007. Franklyn held its world premiere at the 52nd London Film Festival on 16 October 2008. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2009. Synopsis Split between the parallel realities of contemporary London and the otherworldly metropolis of Meanwhile, City, Franklyn follows the tales of four characters. Jonathan Preest (Ryan Phillippe) is a masked vigilante who will not rest until he finds his nemesis, \\"the Individual\\". Emilia (Eva Green) is a troubled young art student whose rebellion may turn out to be deadly. Milo (Sam Riley) is a heartbroken thirty something yearning for the purity of first love. Peter (Bernard Hill) is a man steeped in religion, searching desperately for his missing son amongst London's homeless. Cast * Ryan Phillippe as Jonathan Preest, a masked vigilante detective from Meanwhile, City. Preest is the only atheist in town. * Luke Pettican as Young Jonathan Preest * Eva Green in a dual role as Emilia and Sally. Emilia is a beautiful but damaged student who films her would-be suicide attempts as installations for her art degree. Eva Green has compared her to real people, Sophie Calle and Tracey Emin and described Sally as \\"full of life, very witty, big sense of humor.\\" * Sam Riley as Milo, a young man who has just been jilted at the altar. Riley was cast based on his performance as Ian Curtis in the 2007 film Control. * Bernard Hill as Peter Esser, a Cambridge church warden looking for his wayward son in London. * James Faulkner as Pastor Bone * Art Malik as Tarrant, the head of Meanwhile, City's Ministry * Susannah York as Margaret * Richard Coyle as Dan * Kika Markham as Naomi * Vauxhall Jermaine as Leon * Stephen Walters as Wormsnakes/Wasnik Production Writer-director Gerald McMorrow wrote the original science fiction script Franklyn as his feature debut. It depicts a similar dystopia to his 2002 short Thespian X. In October 2006, actor Ewan McGregor was cast as the lead in the film, which was slated to begin production in summer 2007. However, McGregor broke his leg in a biking accident in February 2007 during the second series of Long Way Round and was forced to leave the project.Reynolds, Simon. \\"Gerald McMorrow ('Franklyn')\\", \\"Digital Spy\\", 27 February 2009. Actors Ryan Phillippe, Eva Green, and newcomer Sam Riley were cast in Franklyn in September 2007. Phillippe was the last to be cast in what McMorrow termed a 'now or never' situation, saying of their first meeting: \\"You have preconceptions about people... You expect the bleach-blond Californian kid and what you got was an incredibly erudite, brought-up-the- wrong-side-of-the-tracks Philadelphia actor. When I met him we did not stop talking all afternoon.\\" McMorrow's visual inspiration for Meanwhile, City came from the religious iconography he saw in Mexico City shopping malls. He later explained: \\"The idea was that if you're going to have a capital city based on religion, you've got somewhere like Florence or Rome and send somewhere like that three miles into the sky... Part of Preest's delirium and fantasies are based on the religion surrounding him and comics he read and films he saw. He sort of pieces together a jigsaw of his own delusions.\\" Preest's mask was primarily influenced by Claude Rains' film of H. G. Wells' novel The Invisible Man. Preest also bears a resemblance to the character Rorschach in Watchmen, not only in terms of clothing but in terms of character. Franklyn had a budget of ¬£6 million, of which ¬£1 million was provided by the UK Film Council through its Premiere Fund. Production began on 24 September 2007 in and around London, and was completed by December 2007. Major locations included an East End bar and Greenwich Naval College, where many of the CGI sequences were shot. McMorrow described his approach, \\"I used an atypical and off-kilter background, and told a story that wouldn't normally be told. The film was set around some tricky locations but we managed to shoot it.\\" The film entered post-production by April 2008. Reception Rights to Franklyn were purchased from sales and financier HanWay Films by Contender Films for the United Kingdom, and Seville Pictures for Canada, with both distributors operating under their parent company Entertainment One. Franklyn premiered at the 52nd London Film Festival on 16 October 2008. The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2009. Dave Calhoun of Time Out opined: \\"Produced by British industry veteran Jeremy Thomas, McMorrow‚Äôs admirable if not entirely coherent debut follows the lives of four people in and around London who are attempting to cope with various crises in their lives, from a relationship break-up and the search for a missing son to the psychological after-effects of military service. The film treads a fine line between realism and fantasy, occasionally dipping out of the world as we know it to visit a seductively strange vision of the capital that appears part-futuristic and part-medieval (and which gives the film its name). Riley follows Control by leaning heavily on middle-distance stares and up-turned collars, while Green is a troubled art student with a good line in haute couture, and Philippe is a troubled ex-soldier. The main problem is that by the time this tricksy film finally plays its hand, many viewers may already have been lost at the wayside.\\" Derek Elley of Variety thought the premise better suited to a novella rather than a feature film, believing that Franklyn lacked an emotional payoff. Elley criticized the script for not developing the ideas it introduced and for lacking background on the characters. The critic also considered Phillippe and Riley to be poor casting in their roles, while Green could not present her dual roles dramatically. Jason Solomons of The Observer reviewed the film, \\"The visual style is impressive but the storylines are thin and the characters all extremely irritating.\\" Fionnuala Halligan of Screen International weighed in: \\"It's unusual in the current film-making climate to see an independent director making such an ambitious debut as Gerald McMorrow's Franklyn. He aims high, visually and conceptually, but a more experienced director would have trouble finding the right tone to pull this intricate plot off. Notices should be at least encouraging: McMorrow has pulled off a very handsome look on a limited budget.\\" References External links 2008 films 2000s crime drama films 2000s fantasy films 2000s science fiction action films 2000s science fiction drama films 2008 independent films 2000s vigilante films British films British crime drama films British fantasy films British science fiction action films British science fiction drama films British independent films British vigilante films British neo-noir films English-language films Films set in London Films shot in London Films produced by Jeremy Thomas Film4 Productions films Alternate timeline films Dystopian films 2008 drama films ","title":"Franklyn"},{"id":"18798845","text":"Bilamperga is a town in the Bilanga Department of Gnagna Province in eastern Burkina Faso.

The screenplay focuses on two families, one wealthy and the other working class, whose lives are intertwined in both love and business. Plot In the prologue, socialite Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates) hosts the wedding of Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) -- the daughter of Charlotte's best friend, Alice Evans (Alfre Woodard) -- and Chris Bennett (Rockmond Dunbar), a construction worker. The couple is congratulated by Charlotte's son, William (Cole Hauser), and his wife, Jillian (KaDee Strickland), who had eloped instead of letting Charlotte plan an elaborate reception for them. William suggests that the newlyweds contact him for employment with the Cartwrights's successful Atlanta construction company after their honeymoon. Four years later, Andrea's sister, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), is married to Ben (Tyler Perry) and looks after Andrea's three-year- old son for extra income while working at their mother's diner. To Pam's chagrin, Andrea doesn't help their mother more financially, though Andrea has designer clothes and a new Mercedes. Andrea is actually enjoying the perks of being in an extramarital affair with William. Chris dreams of opening a construction firm with Ben, but Andrea ridicules Chris's aspirations. At the bank, Chris is rejected for a loan application, but discovers his wife has deposited nearly $300,000 in a secret account. Andrea catches Chris going through her hidden financial records one night. She tells him that the money is bonuses she received from William and that she has the right to some privacy from her spouse. She refuses to finance his business. William is determined to take the family business from his mother, believing the $500-million deal he recently closed will prove his capabilities. Charlotte hires Abigail \\"Abby\\" Dexter (Robin Givens) as COO and determines the company will have to front $25 million to make William's deal viable. The only way to raise the money is for Charlotte to sell 10% of her shares, leaving her with a minority vote. William tells Abby that Charlotte's vote and his vote combined will give the Cartwrights continued control; Abby advises Charlotte to sell her shares. Charlotte asks Alice to go on a road trip in the vintage turquoise Cadillac convertible Charlotte has bought. Alice eventually agrees, and they head west without a set route or schedule. Charlotte introduces Alice to honky tonks and male strip clubs; Alice reciprocates by taking Charlotte to a communal baptism. One night, Charlotte becomes stressed out over her camera and reveals she has early-onset Alzheimer's disease. She has been told nothing can slow her mental decline. At the company gala, both Jillian and Abby discover Andrea and William's affair. William later fires both Chris and Ben after they ask him for money to start a construction business of their own. Abby warns Andrea of the repercussions of the affair that will likely result in her termination from the company, only for Andrea to rebuff this as she fervently believes William will protect her. Convinced that they were marital assets, Chris takes the money from the hidden account and pays deposits to start a construction firm with Ben. Charlotte and Alice return to Atlanta. Andrea confronts Chris for taking her $300,000. She says he and Ben will never be like William. Ben states that nobody cares about William and that Andrea can't see that because of the affair. Andrea admits to Chris that the money was from William, her lover. Angry and disgusted, Chris slaps her, sending her flying over the counter. Andrea, further incensed, tells him to keep the money and move out. As Chris brings up their son, Andrea says William is the father. Alice tries to persuade Andrea to end her affair with William and reconcile with Chris, explaining to her that their affair will not last and William will never marry her, begging her to stop before her life is destroyed. Andrea refuses to believe her, and says if that happens, she will enjoy the ride on the way down. William is plotting to take over the family firm. Although they had never been close, Jillian goes to Charlotte for advice. Charlotte offers little consolation, but reminds her that she is a woman scorned without a prenuptial agreement, and as such can divorce or reconcile and be okay either way. Jillian warns Charlotte of William's plan to have the board vote her out. Chris confronts William on a job site and punches him. Jillian then confronts Andrea in the hotel room where trysts with William were held each Wednesday, and warns her to stay away from her family. Charlotte calls a board meeting and fires William with the support of the Calvary Company, a silent investor revealed to be Alice. Alice has been receiving financial guidance for years from Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Blanchett (Sebastian Siegel), a homeless man she frequently fed at her diner. Earlier, it is explained that Nick had been a regular customer who left large tips until he lost his job, wife, and custody of his children. Nick still visits the diner regularly and pays Alice with solid investment advice. Later, it is revealed that Nick had been working for William as a powerful stockbroker until William fired him without cause. In the parking lot, Andrea approaches William, unaware of the recent events and expecting him to leave Jillian for her. Instead, he washes his hands of Andrea, and drives away, ignoring her claim that her son is his. Charlotte takes a deadly combination of pills and calls Alice, who has an emotional breakdown. Alice gives the eulogy at Charlotte's funeral. The movie ends with Chris and Andrea parting, with the paternity of their son left unclear. Chris is now wealthier, after opening a firm with Ben, while Andrea is sad, guilt- ridden, and lonely. Nick is wealthy and buys a house. William & Jillian reconcile, slowly salvaging their marriage. Alice decides to sell the diner and drives off in the car that Charlotte left her (with a photo of her and Charlotte taped to the dashboard) to start life anew on the road.

Critical reception The Family That Preys received mixed reviews from critics. , the film holds a 52% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 42 reviews with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys treads the filmmaker's established terrain of family loyalty and moral uprightness, though the occasionally predictable plot slides forward, aided by an excess of soapy melodrama.\\" Metacritic gave it a 49/100 approval rating, based on 14 reviews.Metacritic.com, making it Perry's highest reviewed film. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said, \\"The suds that cascade through [the film] more than equal the cubic footage from nighttime soaps like Dallas, Dynasty and their offspring. As the movie proceeds, the flow quickens into a surging flood tide of recriminations and reversals in which blows are exchanged, claws bared and tears shed . . . The Family That Preys doesn‚Äôt worry about how it gets from A to Z. There is no problem that a miraculous (and preposterous) plot development can‚Äôt resolve in two minutes.\\" The New York Daily News rated the film three out of five stars and commented, \\"Perry's notoriously overstuffed plots have sometimes been top-heavy, but this movie, like Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters, hangs on an elegant structure that doesn't feel forced. Perry's skills as a director have improved as his casts have gotten better, and he gives the lovely Woodard one of her most satisfying roles . . . By melding the pleasures of 1950s-style melodrama . . . with equal-gender, African-American-aimed plots, Perry has found success in a niche only he now occupies. And by adding Christian tenets and modern issues . . . Perry shows he knows what his audience wants. First and foremost, that's a smart, satisfying movie experience, which Family is.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today said the best thing about the film \\"is the opportunity it affords to watch a pair of veteran actresses still at the top of their game. Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates play best pals in this soap opera-style story, and the moments each are on-screen are undeniably the movie's best. One senses a rapport and chemistry between the women that transcends the formulaic plot.\\" Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter observed, \\"Although this interracial Dynasty isn't always believable - it's a stretch to accept the lifelong friendship of the two matriarchs as well as the last-minute business coup that they engineer - there's plenty of action to keep us engrossed. Perry wears his religious faith lightly . . . and is shrewd enough to balance piety with raucous humor and lots of sinful shenanigans. Perry's filmmaking skills have improved to the level of competence, and he has assembled a dream cast.\\"The Hollywood Reporter review Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel rated the film two out of five stars and called it Tyler Perry's \\"most cinematically polished production to date\\" but also \\"yet another example of how the mini-mogul from Atlanta is his own worst enemy, raiding his cupboard of his popular but pandering stage plays and not bothering to script doctor them for the screen. As sophisticated as the filmmaking becomes, Perry's scripts are still painfully unsophisticated grab-bags of melodramatic cliches, tired jokes and sermonizing.\\" Peter Debruge of Variety said the film \\"recycles familiar ingredients according to his own unique formula, serving up a lip-smacking, finger-snapping sudser\\" and added, \\"Perry has a tendency to overload his features, and The Family That Preys is no exception, reflecting the helmer's view that the emotional roller-coaster of life can whip its passengers from outrage to exhilaration, from belly laughs to tears in an instant, making for an exhausting yet cathartic overall experience. The result seems ideal for [audiences] who don't see too many movies, cramming enough into one film to satisfy them until the next Perry pic comes out.\\"Variety review Monika Fabian of Time Out New York said, \\"As with Perry‚Äôs other films, his Christian moralistic storytelling can be slightly off-putting ‚Äî but the solid acting and genuinely entertaining story are sure to satisfy fans, and maybe even bring in some converts.\\"Time Out New York review Ken Fox of TV Guide rated the film three out of four stars and said, \\"Thanks to some first-rate acting from its stars, it ranks among Perry's best.\\"TV Guide review Tom Becker of DVD Verdict said, \\"The Family That Preys has that Love Boat kind of watchability and simplicity. Everything runs in a straight line, all endings are inevitable, and emotions and morals are no more complex than a well-timed platitude. The characters are amalgams of recognizable types plunked down in sitcom settings that elicit near-Pavlovian responses of cheers, jeers, and tears. Here and there, Perry throws us a curve ball‚Äîan act of physical violence presented as deserved comeuppance or a character's grim and dubiously appropriate endgame‚Äîbut even these are not jarring enough to derail it. This is film as comfort food, and not the gourmet kind.\\"DVD Verdict review Brian Orndorf of DVD Talk said, \\"Preys\\" is a soap opera in the most unashamed sense, and while this aesthetic has made Perry heaps of coin, his personal screen touch remains some of the worst overall filmmaking around. The new feature is perhaps even more melodramatic than anything that's come before, taking the Andrea/William affair and using it as the inspiration for the cast to arch their eyebrows to assured cramp, flare nostrils in unintentional comedic fury, and bounce impassioned lines of dialogue off each other with medicine ball grace. It's equal parts hilarious and aggravating, with Perry showing little shame as he works the characters into pants-wetting hysteria.\\"DVD Talk review Gregory Kirschling from Entertainment Weekly stated, \\"Tyler Perry's melodramas have a tendency to skid not only off the counter but out the kitchen and down the hall, too. The Family That Preys, his first film in six months, is all over the place: It's a boardroom/family/couples/road-trip story. Kathy Bates plays the head of an Atlanta construction company where Sanaa Lathan is a snooty exec and her husband (Rockmond Dunbar), for maximum class/race sizzle, is a worker grunt. As usual, the villains, like Lathan, are very bad, and the good guys, like Dunbar, are very noble ‚Äî until they get mad and clock their wives.\\" Box office The film opened in 2,070 theaters in North America on September 12, 2008 and grossed $17,381,218 on its opening weekend, ranking #2 at the box office behind Burn After Reading. It eventually earned $37,105,289 domestically, making it the second least successful of Tyler Perry's films to date only ahead of Daddy's Little Girls. Home media The film was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on January 13, 2009. It is in anamorphic widescreen format, with audio tracks and subtitles in English and Spanish. Bonus features include deleted scenes, Two Families, Two Legends, which spotlights stars Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates; Preying in the Big Easy, about filming in New Orleans; Casting the Family, with interviews with the director and cast, and Delving into the Diner, in which production designer Ina Mayhew discusses her concept for the set.

Closter played only one game in the Senators organization, pitching 0.1 innings against the Baltimore Orioles in his MLB debut, before being purchased again by the Yankees on May 3, 1966. After returning to the New York Yankees organization, Closter finished the season with the Greensboro Yankees. Closter spent the entirety of the 1967 season with the double-A Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern League. Closter pitched in only 14 games that year, but made an impressive performance by going 40 with an ERA of 1.74 and 45 strikeouts. In 1968, Closter began the season with the single-A Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League. Playing only five games there, he was quickly promoted to the triple-A Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. For the rest of his career with the Yankees, Closter would bounce between Syracuse and the Major Leagues. Between 1968 and 1973, Closter played a total of 249 games for Syracuse, winning a total of 69 games and losing a total of 58. Major leagues After making his Major League debut with the Senators in 1966, Closter wouldn't play another game in the MLB until 1971, when he made occasional relief appearances for the Yankees. Closter made one start in 1971 against the Detroit Tigers on September 4. He pitched 5.0 innings and allowed 5 hits and 5 earned runs, two of which were home runs. Closter was traded to the Atlanta Braves on September 5, 1973 as the player to be named later as part of a trade that sent Wayne Nordhagen and Frank Tepedino to Atlanta in exchange for pitcher Pat Dobson. In his remaining two seasons in the MLB, Closter only made 6 appearances between the Yankees and Braves, pitching 6.2 innings in relief. Post-retirement In 2006, Closter was elected to the Syracuse Baseball Wall of Fame.

This is the same family that includes familiar aquarium fishes such as guppies and mollies. Heterandria formosa is not as commonly kept in aquaria as these species. H. formosa is one of the smallest fish in the world (7th smallest ), and is the smallest fish found in North America. Despite the common name \\"least killifish\\", it belongs to the family Poeciliidae and not to one of the killifish families. Range and habitat Heterandria formosa is the only member of its genus found in the United States. Its geographical range spans the southeastern United States, from South Carolina south to Georgia and Florida, and westward across the Florida Gulf Coast to Louisiana. In recent years, this species has been collected in eastern Texas. It is recorded to occur along the western portion of the Sabine River basin, according to North American Native Fishes (NANFA). It has also been collected as far west as Humble, TX in small sand pit ponds after the 2017 floods associated with hurricane Harvey. It is one of the few aquarium fishes that is endemic to North America. Heterandria formosa live primarily in vegetated, slow moving or standing freshwater habitats, but this species also occurs in brackish waters. Description Heterandria formosa is one of the smallest fish and smallest vertebrates known to science. Males grow to about 2 centimeters (0.8 inches), while females grow a little larger, to about 3 centimeters (1.2 inches). The fish is generally an olive color, with a dark horizontal stripe through the center of the body. There is also a dark spot on the dorsal fin and females also have a dark spot on their anal fin. Like most poeciliids, male anal fins are modified into a gonopodium (intromittent organ) that is used to deliver sperm and impregnate females during mating. Diet Heterandria formosa primarily eats aquatic invertebrates such as worms and crustaceans. They also eat plant matter. Breeding Like most poeciliids, H. formosa is a livebearer. The male uses his modified anal fin, or gonopodium, to deliver sperm to the female. The fertilized eggs grow within the female until they hatch, and the free-swimming young are released into the water. Heterandria formosa has an uncommon breeding strategy even among livebearers: rather than all of the young being released at once, as many as 40 fry are released over a 10- to 14-day period, but occasionally over a longer period. Inbreeding depression The effect of inbreeding on reproductive behavior was studied in H. formosa in at least one published work. One generation of full-sib mating was found to decrease reproductive performance and likely reproductive success of male progeny. Other traits that displayed inbreeding depression were offspring viability and maturation time of both males and females.

Her rags-to-riches and back to rags again story made her a well-known figure in her own day, and inspired an opera and a Hollywood movie based on her life. Born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, she moved to Colorado in the mid-1870s with her first husband, Harvey Doe, whom she divorced for drinking, gambling, frequenting brothels, and being unable to provide a living. She then moved to Leadville, Colorado, where she met Horace Tabor, a wealthy silver magnate almost twice her age. In 1883 he divorced his first wife, Augusta Tabor, to whom he had been married for 25 years, and married Baby Doe in Washington, D.C. during his brief stint as a US senator, after which they took up residence in Denver. His divorce and remarriage to the young and beautiful Baby Doe caused a scandal in 1880s Colorado. Although Tabor was one of the wealthiest men in Colorado, supporting his wife in a lavish style, he lost his fortune when the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act caused the Panic of 1893 with widespread bankruptcies in silver- producing regions such as Colorado. He died destitute, and she returned to Leadville with her two daughters, living out the rest of her life there. At one time the \\"best dressed woman in the West\\", for the final three decades of her life, she lived in a shack on the site of the Matchless Mine, enduring great poverty, solitude, and repentance. After a snowstorm in March 1935, she was found frozen in her cabin, aged about 81 years. During her lifetime she became the subject of malicious gossip and scandal, defied Victorian gender values, and gained a \\"reputation of one of the most beautiful, flamboyant, and alluring women in the mining West\\".Riley, 2 Her story inspired the opera The Ballad of Baby Doe. Early life and marriage Elizabeth Bonduel McCourt was born in September 1854 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin to Irish-Catholic immigrants Elizabeth Anderson Neilis and Peter McCourt. She later claimed to have been born in 1860 but appears on the 1860 Oshkosh census at 6 years of age. Born in September according to the 1900 census she appears to have been christened on October 7, 1854Temple, p. 7. at St. Peter's Catholic Church.Burke, p. 7. Called Lizzie as a child, the fourth of eleven children, she grew up in a middle-class family in a two-story house. Her father was a partner in a local clothing store and owner of Oshkosh's first theater, McCourt Hall. Her mother fostered in her beautiful daughter the belief that her looks were of great worth, excusing her from domestic chores so as to preserve her skin and allowing her to dream of a future as an actress. Concerned by his wife's indulgence in their young and striking daughter, Peter McCourt thought it prudent to put her to work at the clothing store, where she was often in the company of fashionable young men. At age 16, she was a \\"fashionably plump\\" blond-haired young woman with a hectic social schedule.Riley, 2-3 Oshkosh was a frontier lumber town, filled with mills. When fires raged through Oshkosh in 1874 and again in 1875, the McCourts lost their home, the clothing store, and the theater. They mortgaged their property to rebuild the home and the business, but this put Peter McCourt deeply in debt. The family was forced to live on what amounted to little more than a clerk's salary.Riley, 4 In 1876, Lizzie McCourt met Harvey Doe, who was a Protestant. She enchanted him when, as the only woman competitor, she entered and won a skating competition, while at same time scandalizing many of the townspeople by wearing a costume that showed glimpses of her legs. Lizzy and Harvey were married in 1877 at the Catholic church, to the dissatisfaction of his parents. They then traveled with Harvey's father to Colorado to look after his mining investments, most importantly his half-ownership of the Fourth of July Mine in Central City. After a two-week honeymoon in Denver's American House, the newlyweds joined the elder Doe in the mining town in the mountains. Lizzie found Colorado enchanting.Riley, 5-7 There she may have gained the nickname \\"Baby Doe\\".Colorado Historical Society, Baby Doe Tabor, Colorado's silver queen, PDF file. Move to Colorado In Central City, she quickly found that her husband's reserved temperament was unsuitable for a boisterous frontier mining town, and that he was unable either to manage a mine on his own or to follow his father's instructions on how to do so. Rather than see him fail, and enchanted with the possibility of becoming wealthy from mining gold, she helped her husband. She often dressed in mining clothes and worked directly in the mine. Despite a somewhat relaxed culture in the frontier mining town, those in the highest strata of the city's society considered her behavior and dress scandalous, causing her to be ignored. Through both their efforts, the Does did manage to bring up a small amount of gold, but when the vein ran out and a poorly constructed shaft collapsed, Harvey gave up and decided to take a job as a common mucker at another mine. He told his wife to stop wearing men's clothing and stay at home.Riley, 7-8 Black Hawk during the period Baby Doe Tabor lived there. At that time, they moved from Central City to Black Hawk to live in a less expensive rooming house. Greatly disappointed and disenchanted by the noise and dirt in Black Hawk, Baby Doe began to take walks around the city each day. Then aged 23, she may have gained the name \\"Baby Doe\\" from the local men watching. She lacked domestic skills with which to work and earn money, and she had nothing in common with the women of the town. Often, having little to do with her time, she visited the local clothing store, attracted in part by the expensive fabrics. She became friendly with the owner of the town's clothing store, Jake Sandelowsky. At the same time Harvey lost his job, and their marriage began to deteriorate. By that time Baby Doe was pregnant. Suspecting the child was Jake's, Harvey left her temporarily, and in July 1879, Baby Doe gave birth to a stillborn boy. Meanwhile, Harvey's parents, expecting a grandchild, had moved to Colorado to be near the family. Disappointed, they severed their ties with the two and moved to Idaho Springs, while Baby Doe followed Harvey to Denver despite wishing for a divorce from him. In Denver, Harvey frequented saloons and brothels. After witnessing him with a prostitute, Baby Doe filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery. The divorce was quickly granted in March 1880, but for unknown reasons was not officially recorded until April 1886. Baby Doe then moved to Leadville, Colorado, almost certainly invited there by Sandelowsky, who changed his name to Sands. Alone and without a husband, Baby Doe needed to find a means of financial support quickly. Jake Sandelowsky, who opened a store in Leadville and almost certainly wanted to marry her, offered her employment. Working at a clothing store, however, was a prospect Baby Doe found dull, boring, and too similar to the life she had left behind in Oshkosh.Riley, 9-11 Leadville Horace Tabor built the Tabor Grand Hotel in Leadville, shown here in a modern photograph. The Tabor Opera House in Leadville In Leadville, she caught the attention of Horace Tabor, mining millionaire and owner of Leadville's Matchless Mine. Tabor was married, but in 1880 he left his wife Augusta Tabor to be with Baby Doe; he established her in plush suites at hotels in Leadville and Denver. Horace and Augusta had lived for 25 years on the frontier, first moving to Kansas where they tried their hand at agriculture, then following the gold rush to Colorado, but never striking it rich. Eventually they found their way to Leadville, where Horace, in 1878, grub-staked two prospectors with about $60 worth of goods ($ today) in return for one-third of their profits. To everyone's surprise, the two men's stake was successful, beginning Tabor's path to wealth. With his profits, he bought out the two, then bought stakes in more mines, and had a house built in Denver. He ran successfully for Lieutenant Governor of Colorado in 1878, (when still a territory), and established the Little Pittsburg Consolidated Mining Company, which quickly gained a worth of about $20 million ($ million today). He bought the Matchless Mine, which for many years produced large amounts of silver. His profits were so great that he was quickly on his way to becoming one of the richest men in the country.Riley, 13-15 At an altitude of 10,000 feet, Leadville was the second largest city in Colorado. It boasted over 100 saloons and gambling places, multiple daily and weekly newspapers, and 36 brothels. Tabor's presence seemed to be everywhere.Temple, 13 He opened the Tabor Opera House in Leadville, bought luxury items for his wife, Augusta, and established a private army that he used for protection of his holdings and as a force against striking miners. He spent his money lavishly, mostly on his own entertainment‚Äîdrinking, gambling and frequenting brothels. In 1880, Augusta moved away from him to live in Denver while Tabor enjoyed himself in Leadville. A Denver newspaper columnist described him as \\"Stoop-shouldered; ambling gait ...black hair, inclined to baldness ....dresses in black; magnificent cuff buttons of diamonds and onyx ...worth 8 million dollars.\\" Historian Judy Nolte Temple writes that it \\"seemed inevitable that the prettiest woman in the mining West would eventually meet the richest man.\\" Baby Doe met Horace Tabor in a restaurant in Leadville one evening in 1880. She told him her story and that she had arrived in Leadville because of Jake Sandelowsky's generosity. Tabor gave her $5000 on the spot. Baby Doe then had a message, and $1000, delivered to Sandelowsky, in which she declared that she would not marry him. Instead, Tabor moved her to the Clarendon Hotel, next to the opera house and Sandelowsky's store, Sands, Pelton & Company. Sandelowsky later moved to Aspen, where he opened another store, married, and built a house.Riley, 16-17 Tabor Opera House, Denver, Col, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views Some months later, Tabor moved Baby Doe to the Windsor Hotel in Denver. A newly constructed turreted building, meant to look like Windsor castle, the hotel had extremely lavish decorations such as mirrors made of diamond dust. Tabor had a gold- leafed bath-tub in his suite. Guests were wealthy, well-known and well- connected.Riley, 18-19 Baby Doe claimed to love Tabor, and he loved her. He moved permanently out of his Denver home and asked his wife Augusta for a divorce. She refused him. He, in turn, refused to send her an invitation to attend the grand opening of Denver's Tabor Grand Opera House. He stopped giving his wife money; she sued him but failed; he again demanded a divorce. Baby Doe suggested that he seek a divorce in a different jurisdiction, and in 1882 a Durango, Colorado, judge granted them a divorce.Riley, 18-19 However, the filing was irregular, and once Tabor realized that, he had the county clerk paste together two pages in the records to hide the action. Despite his existing marriage to Augusta, Horace Tabor and Elizabeth McCourt Doe married secretly in St. Louis, Missouri, in September 1882.Leadville.com, Leadville's famous love triangle: Horace, Augusta, and \\"Baby Doe\\" Tabor. At that time both were bigamists: his divorce was questionable and hers was not yet recorded.Riley, 18-19 Marriage to Horace Tabor In January 1883, Augusta sued Tabor again, and now he compensated her with real estate in Denver and stock in his mines. Tabor finally obtained a legal divorce at that time. That same month, the Colorado State Legislature appointed him to a 30-day term as United States Senator to fill a temporary vacancy because the sitting senator, Henry Teller, had been appointed a cabinet member.Willison, 219-226. Baby Doe and Horace married publicly on 1 March 1883, just two months after Tabor and Augusta had divorced. He was 52 and she 28, and she claimed to be only 22. The marriage took place during Tabor's brief tenure as a US senator, at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC. Baby Doe invited President Chester A. Arthur and other dignitaries who attended, as reported by the media at the time of her death, though a more recent biography claims many invitations were declined.Riley, 20-21 Photograph of Horace Austin Warner Tabor, taken between 1870 and 1880 She planned a lavish wedding, going first to Oshkosh, making arrangements for her family to attend the event, and purchasing clothing and jewelry for them. Her mother was proud that her daughter was marrying a wealthy man, and Baby Doe herself was quite happy. At her wedding in Washington, she wore a white satin dress that cost $7,000 and the $90,000 necklace known as the \\"Isabella\\" necklace. Two days after the wedding, the priest who had performed the ceremony refused to sign the marriage license when he learned that both the bride and the groom had previously divorced and that Baby Doe was a Roman Catholic. Although Tabor's contemporaries had winked at or ignored his dalliance with Baby Doe, Tabor's divorce and quick remarriage created a scandal which prevented the couple from being accepted in polite society. Only a few months later, Horace's bid to be elected governor of Colorado ended in failure. Baby Doe's father died at around the same time. The couple returned to Colorado, where they took up permanent residence in a Denver mansion. Baby Doe was snubbed by Denver socialites, from whom she received neither visits nor invitations. Although she did not join charities or clubs, as was customary during that period for wealthy women, she was generous with her money, donating funds to various charities, and providing free offices to the Colorado suffragette movement. To keep herself busy, she shopped, bought jewelry and clothing, had her hair done and continued with the hobby of scrapbooking she had taken up when living in Central City.Riley, 22-23 Photograph of Baby Doe Tabor taken between 1885 and 1895 On July 13, 1884, she gave birth to the first of her and Tabor's two daughters, Elizabeth Bonduel Lily Tabor. The infant was christened in an extravagant and frilly outfit costing $15,000. Baby Doe was reportedly a good mother, staying at home with her daughter instead of accompanying Horace on his frequent trips to look after widespread business interests. Their second daughter, Rose Mary Echo Silver Dollar Tabor, was born on December 17, 1889. Both girls were attractive and well looked-after, and their mother doted on them. The second child was fondly called Silver or Silver Dollar, whom Baby Doe \\"defiantly nursed ... as she rode through the streets in Denver in one of her carriages.\\"Riley, 22-23 A year after the birth of their second child, in 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act was enacted, which brought to Colorado, and Colorado mine-owners, the hope that wildly fluctuating silver prices would stabilize. Profits from silver mining had diminished as the supply had declined and the extraction process and labor costs had increased. When a few of Horace's investments began to fail, he was forced to mortgage the Tabor theater in Denver and other real estate he had bought during the past decades. Horace Tabor lost his fortune in 1893 when the repeal of the Silver Act caused the Panic of 1893. Silver prices plummeted and fortunes in Colorado were instantly wiped out. As she had with her first husband, Baby Doe pitched in. Horace gave her the legal power to run his business concerns in Denver, and she made decisions for him during his absences. To raise money, she sold most of her jewelry, and when the couple had the power turned off in their mansion, she made a game of it for the children. Eventually, the mansion and its contents were sold. At age 65, to earn a living, Horace took a job as a common mineworker, while the family lived in a boarding house. From 1893 to 1898, the Tabors endured great poverty, although some friends lent them money. To save him from poverty, some political friends arranged his appointment as postmaster of Denver in 1898. The family at that time lived on his annual salary of $3700 per year and took up residence in a plain room at the Windsor Hotel. Horace's health soon gave out, and 15 months after his appointment to the position, he died.Riley, 24-25 His funeral was well attended, with perhaps as many as 10,000 there. On his deathbed he is said to have told Baby Doe to \\"hold on the Matchless mine ‚Ä¶ it will make millions again when silver comes back.\\" However, that story might not be true; by then, it appears they had mortgaged and/or lost the Matchless mine. At the time of her husband's death, Baby Doe was still an attractive woman in her mid-forties. Later years The Matchless mine Matchless mine and Baby Doe Tabor cabin, where she lived for the latter part of her life After her husband's death, Baby Doe stayed in Denver for a period, according to her diaries and correspondence. Why she decided to leave Denver and the society there to make a return to Leadville, in the high mountains with its cold winters, is unknown, but it almost certainly had to do with the Matchless mine.Temple, 109-110 For two years she unsuccessfully tried to find investors to bring the Matchless back into production.Temple, 31 The family may have tried to regain ownership to the Matchless mine, but documentation is fragmented, and it is unclear to whom the mine belonged at that time. In 1901, one of her McCourt sisters may have attempted to buy the mine at a sheriff's sale, but again the fragmented documentation is murky about ownership. When Baby Doe moved with her girls back to Leadville, she claimed she would work the mine herself, despite its deteriorated condition. Temple writes that the mine's shafts were flooded and had not been in working condition for many years, and furthermore that Horace would have known this. To earn money, she took on menial domestic jobs. Unknown to her, her brother paid the grocer so that the three women had food. Eventually, in an attempt to keep the decrepit mine going and to raise funds, she reluctantly sold the \\"Isabella necklace\\" Tabor had given her, but during her lifetime she refused to sell his gold watch fob. Her older daughter, Lily, left her mother to live with Baby Doe's family in Wisconsin. Later, after her mother died, Lily denied being Baby Doe's daughter.Temple, 42 Of the two daughters, Lily, born into wealth, seemed more affected by the fall into poverty. When in 1902, Baby Doe traveled with her daughters to Oshkosh to visit her relatives, Lily decided then to prolong her visit, to stay and provide care for her elderly grandmother. Later, Lily moved to Chicago, where in 1908 she married her first cousin, and soon after gave birth to Baby Doe's grandchild. In 1911, Baby Doe and Silver again visited relatives in Wisconsin, going on to visit Lily in Chicago. After such a prolonged absence, Lily claimed she barely knew Silver Dollar.Temple, 116-118 Baby Doe's daughter Silver Dollar Tabor After Lily's departure, Baby Doe and Silver Dollar moved into a cabin on the site of the Matchless mine. The living quarters were basic and inadequate for Colorado winters: \\"All told, it was no larger than a medium sized room. Two windows had been cut into the flimsy weatherboards, but these had been nailed up\\". The structure was a former tool shed located adjacent to the hoisthouse, described by a visitor in 1927 as \\"crowded with very primitive furniture, decorated with religious pictures, and stacked high in newspapers.\\"Bancroft, 4-6 The cabin was isolated, located above Leadville in Little Strayhorse Gulch, and had an unimpeded view of Mount Elbert and Mount Massive. Silver Dollar also left Leadville, soon after she had turned to drink and had become sexually precocious. Worried, Baby Doe was happy to send her away to Denver. There, Silver Dollar wrote for the Denver Times, sending part of her earnings to her mother on a weekly basis. She then attempted to become a novelist, while at the same time gaining a bad reputation in Denver for her drunken antics. Perhaps to escape Colorado, she moved to Chicago where again she tried her hand at writing. Eventually, after working as a dancer under various names, she became the mistress of a Chicago gangster. In 1925, Silver Dollar was found scalded to death under suspicious circumstances in her Chicago boarding house, where she had been living under the name \\"Ruth Norman\\".Temple, 34-36 For the rest of her life, Baby Doe refused to believe the woman found as Ruth Norman had been her daughter, stating, \\"I did not see the body they said was my little girl.\\" Alone in the cabin outside Leadville, Baby Doe turned to religion. She considered her life of great wealth a period of vanity and created penances for herself. During the frigidly bitter Colorado high-country winters, she wound burlap sacks around her legs. With no money, she ate very little, living on stale bread and suet, and refused to accept charity. Baby Doe lived like this for 35 years.Riley, 26-27 During these years she wrote incessantly. In diaries, letters, and scraps she called \\"Dreams and Visions\\", consisting of about 2000 fragments later found bundled in piles of paper in her cabin, she wrote entries such as: \\"Nov. 26‚Äî1918 Papa Tabor's Birthday I owe my room rent & am in need of food and only enough bread for tonight & breakfast .... my shoes and stockings only 1 pair are in rags.\\" An eyewitness described her in 1927 as dressed \\"in corduroy trousers, mining boots, and a torn soiled blouse .... [with] a blue bandana tied around her head\\", and went on to say that \\"her eyes were very far apart and a gorgeous blue\\". She wandered the streets of Leadville, rags on her feet, wearing a cross, and came to be known as a madwoman. Some who had been acquainted with her earlier thought she deserved to suffer for having broken up the marriage between Horace and Augusta, and believed that she had been the cause of his ruin.Temple, x At that time, Leadville had lost much of its boomtown population and was becoming a ghost-town. She often walked the empty streets at night, dressed in a mixture of women's and men's clothing, wearing trousers and mining boots. She protected the mine from strangers with a shot-gun, and \\"she became a sad spectre of Baby Doe to old-timers; a spectacle to the young.\\" Death In the winter of 1935, after an unusually severe snowstorm, some neighbors noticed that no smoke was coming out of the chimney at the Matchless mine cabin. Investigating, they found Baby Doe dead, her body frozen on the floor.Time, \\"Women: the end of Baby Doe,\\" 18 March 1935.Judy Nolte Temple, \\"The demons of Elizabeth Tabor,\\" Colorado Heritage, Winter 2001, p.3-21. The Rocky Mountain News reported that a miner and friend, concerned at not seeing her for some days, broke into the cabin and found the body. The newspaper went on to compare her to another female Leadville resident, Molly Brown. For one last time, Baby Doe made the front pages of the papers. The interment had to be postponed because the ground in Leadville at that time of year was \\"still frozen five feet deep\\".Michael Madigan, \\"March 8, 1935: the death of 'Baby Doe',\\", Rocky Mountain News. While a gravesite was being prepared in Leadville‚Äîthe ground had to be dynamited‚Äîwealthy Denverites raised money to have her body brought there. A funeral mass was held in Leadville, then her casket was sent by train to Denver. She was apparently 81 years old at the time of her death. Her remaining possessions were auctioned off to souvenir collectors for $700.Time, \\"People,\\" 1 July 1935. Baby Doe Tabor is buried with her husband in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. Reputation and legacy Baby Doe Tabor is a legend among the women of the mining West. She holds the reputation of being a great beauty, a home-wrecker, and in her later years, a madwoman. Judy Nolte Temple writes that Baby Doe's legend, and her sins, grew quickly in retelling, as evidenced by an exaggerated description of her death in an early biography: \\"The formerly beautiful and glamorous Baby Doe Tabor ... was found dead on her cabin floor .... only partially clothed ....frozen into the shape of a cross\\". She was rumored to be a gold-digger and a poor mother. Scavengers searched for non- existent treasure after her death, but Temple says the real treasure was found in Baby Doe's writing, which has taken decades to archive, analyze and study, and only now is beginning to reveal the inner life of the woman.Temple, ix Temple sees her as one in a long line of women who endured shunning and punishment for her beauty and for being disruptive to prevailing social norms. Temple speculates that Baby Doe's move to Leadville after Horace's death may have been self-shunning from Denver society. Baby Doe was portrayed in the Warner Brothers film Silver Dollar, which premiered in Denver in 1932. \\"Lily\\", the fictionalized character of Baby Doe, was portrayed by actress Bebe Daniels; Edward G. Robinson played Yates Martin, a fictionalized Horace Tabor.Time, \\"Cinema: the new pictures,\\" 2 January 1933. Douglas Moore's opera The Ballad of Baby Doe premiered in Central City, Colorado, in 1956. In the New York premiere in 1958, Baby Doe was sung by Beverly Sills.US Opera, The Ballad of Baby Doe.

The building was designed by Oreste Ziroli, an Italian immigrant who worked as a draftsman for the building's builder, J. W. Bishop. The exterior of the building is terracotta that has been decorated with medallions on agricultural themes. The market was designed with modern (for the period) ideas of efficiency. The main floor, covering , was devoted to retail space, and was designed to comfortably handle 4,500 customers. The basement and second floor were storage space, arranged so that supplies were located near their retail points on the main floor. These areas were connected to the main floor by elevators, eliminating the need for delivery vehicles to move in customer aisles.

It is composed of four villages: Banloc, Ofseni»õa (Ofsenitz; Kar√°tsonyifalva), Parto»ô (Partos) and Soca (Kar√°tsonyiliget). Name Banloc name was originally born by the fusion of two words: the name of the god \\"Pan\\" and the word \\"loc\\" (place), \\"Pan's place\\".http://www.cjtimis.ro/uploads/files/Mic%20Atlas%20al%20Judetului%20Timis/EN/116-118%20Atlas%20engleza%20-%20Banloc.pdf Later, when the \\"pan\\" became \\"ban\\", it kept the original meaning of a master. The Panloc castle became the Banloc castle, name preserved until now. There is a relief above one of the access doors in the basement of the castle, bas- relief depicting the god Pan playing the syrinx. Also, statues in the form of fauns used to guard the alleys of the park, fragments of these are currently held at the Museum of Banat in Timi»ôoara, along with several other statues of the same origin. History View of the Banloc center near the year 1906 The commune is first attested on May 13, 1400 in a document given to the clerk of Cenad, under the name of ‚ÄûByallak‚Äù. For almost two centuries (1552‚Äì1716) it was the summer residence of Teme≈üvar Eyalet's pasha. In 1716, Banat was conquered by the Austrians. At the census of 1717, it was registered as Panloch, belonging to the Ciacova district with 85 inhabited houses. On Count Mercy's map made between 1723-1725, the village appears as Banlok. Although, the state area of Banloc is assigned, by the exchange of land, to the Croatian Ban of Dra≈°koviƒá. In 1783 the domain is sold to Count L√°z√°r Kar√°tsonyi from the Kar√°tsonyi of Beodra (now Novo Milo≈°evo, Serbia, Vojvodina province), which ten years later built on ancient foundations, the current castle located in the center of the village. The history of Banloc is closely linked to the history of the domain and its economic performance. The domain of the Kar√°tsonyi counts included extensive forests rich with game, farmland - most of which were spectacular rice fields from Topolea (Hungarian: Topolyapuszta)  fishing lakes, tobacco plantations, farm animals (from Pescu»ô), stud farms, a distillery and a mill located near the train station in Banloc. After 1919, the domain loses a part of the land due to the border that appeared between the Kingdom of Romania and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Even after the agricultural reform of 1921, the Banloc area with the castle and park remained one of the largest in the country. The Royal House of Romania becomes interested in its fate and, in 1935, it was redeemed from the Kar√°tsonyi family. Banloc becomes royal domain and permanent residence of Princess Elizabeth - former Queen of Greece - sister of King Carol II of Romania. Landmarks *Banloc Castle *\\"Sf.

While the PN are known mainly for the disruption of Second Life and its users, they have also established themselves on the video sharing website YouTube, where they have posted videos of their activities including server raids. Their method of attack ranges from trolling a group or individual to the manipulation of the in-game scripting engine, where they perform such activities as showering their targets with boxes covered in internet memes and shock images. These boxes then produce storms of graphical particles that block the victim's vision. They have also created avatars similar to those of the residents being harassed and destroyed them in gruesome ways to simulate a virtual death. The Patriotic Nigras have also caused the crashing of several Second Life regions (or \\"simulators\\") by using self-replicating objects that overload the processing power of the computer running them.Dibbell, Julian. \\"Mutilated Furries, Flying Phalluses: Put the Blame on Griefers, the Sociopaths of the Virtual World.\\" Wired. 18 January 2008.

The DHRA has also described them as a prime example of online criminal gang culture including spillover effects into real life gang activity.Schechter, Olga G., Eric L. Lang, and Christina R.

The Guardian. 22 June 2011. Membership in the group has ranged from 35 members in 2007 up to a rough 200 at their peak in mid-2011. History Habbo Hotel furry protesters at Anthrocon 2007 wear afro wigs and suits, and carry a sign saying \\"Pool is Closed\\" in reference to Patriotic Nigras raids on Habbo Hotel. The origin of the Patriotic Nigras has been traced by cyber-rights researcher Peter Ludlow to the /b/ imageboard of the imageboard 4chan where board members decided in late 2005 to \\"raid\\" Habbo Hotel, a popular avatar-based social networking game. The raid took the form of numerous black men presenting avatars with outsize afros and Armani suits blocking access to the virtual pool and telling other users that \\"the pool is closed because of AIDS.\\" From this raid, according to Ludlow, emerged the Patriotic Nigras and their Internet meme slogan \\"Pool's Closed.\\"Ludlow, Peter. Watching the Watchers: Power and Politics in Second Life (Part One). Henryjenkins.org. 9 April 2010. The success of the first raid has led the Patriotic Nigras to perform raids on the Habbo Hotel during subsequent years. The 2006 anniversary raid was organized at the /i/ imageboard of the website 7chan. The format of these raids is always the same with the use of avatars that look like black men with afros, and with the group sometimes attempting to offend users by forming images with the avatars such as swastikas. Second Life The Second Life phase of the group's activities began in early 2006 when an anonymous user known as \\"Mudkips Acronym\\" reposted on 4chan a question originally posed at eBaum's World regarding whether or not Second Life \\"was raidable.\\" There were 143 Patriotic Nigras members as of September 2007, of which around 35‚Äì60 were active. The response to \\"Mudkips Acronym\\"'s challenge was rapid and the group soon established itself as a fixture on Second Life. As of 2008, the Patriotic Nigras were said to operate hundreds, if not thousands, of Second Life accounts.Girard, Nicole. \\"Griefer Madness: Terrorizing Virtual Worlds\\". MacNews. Accessed August 10, 2008. By mid-2006, a number of Second Life users had had enough of the PN's antics and a Second Life member named \\"Kalel Venkman\\" formed a counter-griefer vigilante group named the Justice League Unlimited. With avatars donning the skins of superheroes like Superman and Wonder Woman, the Justice League Unlimited established monitors in many areas of Second Life and zealously reported any untoward behavior to the Linden Lab administrators. The zeal with which they executed their duties, however, proved to be problematic and they were soon banned from areas such as FurNation for excessive vigilantism. According to cyber-rights researcher, Peter Ludlow, the Justice League Unlimited's anti-PN efforts also became problematic as the close association between 4chan users and Patriotic Nigras led to the unwarranted harassment of many users who were 4channers only and not members of the PN. In February 2007, the group gained media coverage after an attack on the Second Life headquarters of politician John Edwards in which the Patriotic Nigras attacked with their avatars bearing \\"Bush 08\\" buttons and defaced Edwards's structure with feces, Marxist/Leninist posters, and obscenity.Fulco, Ivan. \\"Griefer: non chiamatemi vandalo, sono un attivista dei mondi virtuali!\\". La Stampa. Accessed August 10, 2008. (Italian)Brownlee, John. \\"John Edwards Meets Second Life 'Feces Spewing Obscenity'\\". Wired. 2 March 2007. They also received coverage for an earlier attack on a room where Second Life user Anshe Chung was being interviewed about her claims to have made the 'virtual property' equivalent of over one million dollars off the game. The room was invaded by flying penises.Giles, Jim. \\"Virtual entrepreneurs and 'griefers' spoil the fantasy of online worlds\\". New Scientist. Vol.195, Iss.2619. Pp.28‚Äì29. 1 September 2007. This incident was also attributed to the \\"Room 101\\" group. Titlescreen of the ShoopedLife client The Patriotic Nigras were at first tolerated by the producers of Second Life, Linden Lab, but after the John Edwards attack they began to crack down and now take efforts to find and ban griefers on sight. To fight back, the Patriotic Nigras found ways to bypass the bans Linden Lab typically employs. New Media critics have described the Patriotic Nigras' antagonistic relationship with Linden Lab as arising in reaction to the company's player-monitoring policies (described as part of a broadly Foucaultian institutionalized control apparatus).B√§cke, Maria and Francisco J. Ricardo, ed. \\"Self, Setting, and Situation in Second Life.\\" Literary Art in Digital Performance: Case Studies in New Media Art and Criticism. Continuum International Publishing Group. Pp.111, 133. 2009. To further their aims on Second Life, the PN developed a modified Second Life client called ShoopedLife that allowed them to bypass many of the hardware-banning methods typically used by Linden Lab to prevent persistent griefers from accessing Second Life. Reacting against this, the Justice League Unlimited formed close associations with Linden Lab administrators, going so far as to monitor when administrators were available for contact so that griefing could be rapidly halted. As Patriotic Nigras countermeasures intensified the situation, Justice League Unlimited suspicions concerning Patriotic Nigras connections to 4chan deepened and Second Life players received bans for nothing more than their association with 4chan. This finally culminated in the closing of Woodbury University's virtual campus, and led thereafter to an escalation of factional maneuvers between the Woodbury group and the Justice League Unlimited who characterized all opponents as PN sympathizers. In a series of multi-directional infiltrations, personal information including the real life names of \\"Kalel Venkman,\\" several Woodbury group members, writers for The Alphaville Herald, and Patriotic Nigras leader \\"Mudkips Acronym\\" was published online. In August 2007, \\"Mudkips Acronym\\" resigned in fear that this information would be used to compromise his security, and by mid-2008, the Justice League Unlimited had been disbanded following embarrassing revelations of the nature of their relationship with Linden Lab and their efforts to \\"dox\\" Second Lifers suspected of connections to the PNs through the collection of extensive dossier-style information.Ludlow, Peter. Watching the Watchers: Power and Politics in Second Life (Part Two). Henryjenkins.org. 12 April 2010. Following the exit of \\"Mudkips Acronym,\\" members of the Patriotic Nigras held an election to determine the new leader, which was won by a user known online as \\"^ban^\\".

The Griefer Herald. 3 August 2008. Accessed August 10, 2008. In July 2008, the PN client, ShoopedLife was further modified to utilize the Lua code base to automate specific functions of the regular client. In December 2008, the main developer for ShoopedLife, \\"N3X15,\\" left the Patriotic Nigras, effectively ending development of the client.

When hoop skirts went out of fashion, the building was converted to produce wire. Originally a three-story building, it was raised to four between 1888 and 1892. Seven buildings were built in 1869 and 1870, representing the major development of the complex. The primary focus of this expansion was the Main Mill, which is long, and the Long Mill, which is .

It is one of Limerick's newer suburbs, and is home to the campus of University Hospital Limerick and the Crescent Shopping Centre. Etymology The name Dooradoyle () means \\"paddock of the blind man\\", where \\"tuar\\" means paddock or field, and \\"dall\\" refers to a blind person. Other sources translate \\"tuar\\" as a bleach-green ‚Äî a stretch of grass set aside for the drying and bleaching of linen. Description It is part of the Ecclesiastical parish of St Paul in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limerick. St Paul's was created in 1971, partitioned from the parish of Mungret - Raheen - Crecora, though some parts of Dooradoyle remain in that parish. Until June 2014, Dooradoyle was the site of the administrative offices of Limerick County Council. Since the merger of Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council these offices have become civic offices for the merged Limerick City and County Council. Several attempts were made by Limerick City Council to expand its area of control to include Castletroy, Raheen, and Dooradoyle: all until recently administered by Limerick County Council. Since the merger of the authorities the district has become part of the Limerick Metropolitan district which enlarged the city area to include the large suburban districts such as Dooradoyle. Dooradoyle is located in the south west area of Limerick City on the R526 road (formerly the main N20 route), also called St Nessan's Road. The suburb is now bypassed by the M20 motorway to the south. The earliest developments in the area began in the 1960s, and Dooradoyle has experienced rapid growth since.  Services  The Civic Offices of Limerick City and County Council are in Dooradoyle, along with the county's motor tax office and the county library headquarters. The Crescent Shopping Centre, Ireland's largest shopping centre outside of Dublin, is located in Dooradoyle. The Omniplex, Limerick's largest cinema with twelve screens, is on the site of the Crescent Shopping Centre. There are also smaller, local shops, bars and restaurants, along with a leisure centre and gym. Dooradoyle is the location of the campus of University Hospital Limerick, the biggest hospital in the mid west of Ireland.  Religion  St Paul's is the area's Roman Catholic church. Dooradoyle is also home to the Limerick Mosque and a meeting hall of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Mungret Abbey, an ancient monastery, is located just outside Dooradoyle.  Education  The main primary school serving the area is St Paul's NS, though students in some estates in Dooradoyle are zoned to St Nessan's NS in nearby Mungret. The area is also home to St Gabriel's School, a special needs school, and Gaelscoil an R√°ith√≠n, an Irish-medium school. Dooradoyle is home to Crescent College, a comprehensive secondary school. However, many students from the area attend secondary schools in Limerick City.  Sports  Regional United is an amateur football club based in Dooradoyle. The home ground of Garryowen is located in Dooradoyle, while Old Crescent and Young Munster are both based in the neighbouring townland of Rosbrien.

Location and building history The Odd Fellows' Home is located in northeastern Worcester, a short way east of Interstate 190 and the Greendale Mall, at the corner of Barber and Randolph Streets. The land for the facility was donated in 1890 by Thomas Dodge, a prominent local patent lawyer, who eventually donated in all, in order ensure \\"ample light and air\\" for the residents. The original main building was a large three story brick building built in 1890-92 to a design by Barker & Nourse. The most prominent feature was a projecting 5-1/2 story mansard-roofed tower with round-topped clock dormers projecting from the half story mansard. The front bays were divided by brick pilasters, and a single- story porch extended across part of the front. To this building's right (east) was the first major addition, added in 1902; it was a 2-1/2 story brick Classical Revival structure that increased the facility's capacity to 110 beds. Its facade had limestone quoining, and it had a Classical Revival entry porch with Tuscan columns. The old facility was sold in 2012 to a development firm, and was demolished in 2014 to provide added facilities to the adjacent Dodge Park Rest Home. Materials from the building were salvaged for use in other settings.

History The village was built by German (Banat Swabian) settlers in 1786 during the third great immigration of Germans during this period under Emperor Joseph II and settled with Protestants. The community name derives from the administrator Baron Nikolaus von Vecsey. Apparently the commissioner of the colony wanted to name the village Veczehaza in honour of the Baron. The Baron declined this proposal and replied: \\"Nein, er soll Liebling hei√üen, denn die Protestanten sind meine Lieblinge.\\" (No, it should be called Liebling [favourite], as the Protestants are my favorites.) In 1880 there were 4,085 people, including 719 ethnic Romanians and 3,318 German-speaking Danube Swabians. In 1926, after the village and region was united with the Kingdom of Romania, 16 Romanian families from Transylvania were settled here. By 1941, there were 5,086 people, including 886 Romanians and 4,086 Danube Swabians. However, over 2,000 people (mostly German-speaking) fled the advancing Soviet army on 22 September 1944 with their Pastor Andreas Nagelbach.

It is composed of two villages, Gottlob and Vizejdia (Wiseschdia; Vizesd). These were part of Lovrin Commune until 2004, when they were split off. Etymology The commune's name is of German origin, with the meaning of \\"Praise to the Lord\\". History The village was founded between 1770 and 1773 and entailed 203 houses. The Catholic parish was also founded in 1773. The majority of the population was Catholic until the 1940s. Until 1967 Gottlob was a commune, but due to the dwindling population it was demoted to village level without its own administration and incorporated in the Lovrin commune. In 2003 Gottlob received again commune status and has since elected its own mayor. The Germans (Banat Swabians) formed until 1940 the majority of Gottlob's population (1910: 91%). There was also a sizable French community.Istv√°n N√©meth - A magyarorsz√°gi franci telepek After the war, the ethnic composition of the local residents changed decisively - the number of German residents fell from 1,836 in 1910 to 875 in 1977, representing only 38% of the residents. This trend has continued and led to a number of only 160 Germans in 1991 and 98 in February 1996. Main reasons are the migration to Germany either immediately after the Second World War or during the Communist regime. Another wave of emigration took place after the opening of borders at the beginning of the 1990s. The exodus of residents left Gottlob to the situation where only one in three or four houses is inhabited. Until 1992, Gottlob had a German school and a German kindergarten, but they were closed due to lack of pupils. The Romanian school in the village remained the sole institution responsible for education. The local church was built in 1867 and lavishly decorated through donations by the rich congregations of the village. The ceiling paintings and the altar were cared of for well over a hundred years. Several sculptures of saints have been specially cared of by local families, which constituted a special honor. Parts of the church furnishings were stolen or destroyed during the 1990s. A renovation of the exterior facade succeeded the late 1990s by donations from Germany. In 1994 a memorial stone was unveiled in the local cemetery. The inscription on the memorial stone reads: :Den Toten zum Ged√§chtnis, den Lebenden zum Verm√§chtnis :1939 - 1945 gefallene Helden 52 :1945 - 1949 Ru√ülandverschleppung 17 Tote :1951 - 1956 Deportation in den Baragan 9 Tote :Ruhet sanft! - Gemeinde Gottlob :\\"In memory of the dead, legacy to the living :1939 - 1945 Fallen heroes 52 :1945 - 1949 Expulsion to Russia 17 dead :1951 - 1956 Deportation to the BƒÉrƒÉgan 9 dead :Rest in peace! - Commune Gottlob\\" Gottlob today Nowadays the Romanian majority shapes Gottlob's cultural image. The first church consecration was held on 3 November 1996 and was accompanied by a costumed parade. The former state-owned station for the mechanization of agriculture (SMA) was divided after 1989 into several companies who farm the land of the village and neighboring communes. The old premises of the station fell into disrepair.

Ernst was also the nephew of the playwright Georg B√ºchner and the philosopher, physiologist and physician Ludwig B√ºchner. B√ºchner studied chemistry in T√ºbingen. In his dissertation, he addressed the issue of separation of Chlorbromanilins. In 1882, Ernst B√ºchner took over the management of the family business. In 1890 he divided the Pfungstadt operating in the \\"United ultramarine factories\\". The creation of such an agreement was in response to the emerging \\"petrochemistry\\" whose further growth finally resulted in the extinction of the company in 1893. B√ºchner was first married with his cousin Mathilda B√ºchner (6 January 1850 ‚Äì 1 April 1908) and had two children with her, the chemist Carl B√ºchner (28 June 1877 ‚Äì 9 July 1929) and the painter Friedrich (Fritz) B√ºchner (1 April 1880 ‚Äì 22 June 1965).

This type of building was not uncommon in the city at the time of its 1896 construction. This building affords commanding views of the Boston area from its site near the top of Prospect Hill, and has well-preserved Colonial Revival styling. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Grandview is located near the summit of Prospect Hill, a hill overlooking the city of Boston that was of military importance during the American Revolutionary War. It stands immediately west of Prospect Hill Park, on the south side of Munroe Street. It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a truncated hip roof and clapboard siding. A central full-height gable-roofed pavilion projects from the center of the north-facing facade, with a two-story porch projecting further. The fully pedimented gable is decorated with modillions and dentil moulding, the latter of which is also found at the roof line. The porch is flanked by two- story projecting bays, and there are gable-roof dormers projecting from the roof on several sides. The rear of the building has full-width porches on all three levels. Most of the building's windows have been modernized, with three- pane sliding windows typical. The Grandview was built in 1896 by Elbridge Park, a city alderman, and was one of 45 \\"apartment hotels\\" listed in the city directory in 1900. These types of transient apartment houses were built in the city near ready access to public transportation, and catered to commuters working in Boston.

Penny's first career was as a radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). After she turned to writing, she won numerous awards for her work, including the Agatha Award for best mystery novel of the year five times, including four consecutive years (2007‚Äì2010), and the Anthony Award for best novel of the year five times, including four consecutive years (2010‚Äì2013). Her novels have been published in 23 languages. Early life and career with CBC Penny was born in Toronto in 1958. Her mother was an avid reader of both fiction and non- fiction, with a particular liking for crime fiction, and Louise grew up reading mystery writers such as Agatha Christie, Georges Simenon, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Michael Innes. Penny earned a Bachelor of Applied Arts (Radio and Television) from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Ryerson University) in 1979. After graduation, at age 21, she embarked on an 18-year career as a radio host and journalist with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. At the start of her broadcasting career, Penny took postings at locations far from friends and family, and to help deal with feelings of loneliness and isolation, she increasingly turned to alcohol. At age 35, she admitted to an alcohol problem, and has been sober since. Shortly afterward, she met her future husband, Michael Whitehead, head of hematology at Montreal Children's Hospital, on a blind date. Literary career After her marriage, Penny left the CBC to take up writing. She started a historical novel but had difficulty finishing it, and eventually switched to mystery writing. She entered her first novel, Still Life, in the \\"Debut Dagger\\" competition in the United Kingdom, placing second out of 800 entries. The novel won other awards, including the \\"New Blood\\" Dagger award in the United Kingdom, the Arthur Ellis Award in Canada for best first crime novel, the Dilys Award, the Anthony Award and the Barry Award for Best First Novel in the United States. Penny continues to write, garnering major crime novel award nominations for almost every one of her novels and subsequently winning several of those awards. Her work features Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, head of the homicide department of the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec. The novels are set in the province of Quebec but feature many hallmarks of the British whodunit genre, including murders by unconventional means, bucolic villages, large casts of suspects, red herrings, and a dramatic disclosure of the murderer in the last few pages of the book. In 2009, Penny helped to launch a new award for aspiring Canadian mystery writers, the Unhanged Arthur for Best Unpublished First Novel. Penny currently lives in Knowlton, a small village in Quebec's Eastern Townships about 100 km from Montreal, Quebec. Her husband Michael died on September 18, 2016. Honours In 2013, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada \\"for her contributions to Canadian culture as an author shining a spotlight on the Eastern Townships of Quebec\\".. In 2017 she was made a Member of the Order of Quebec. Movie adaptations For several years, Penny resisted selling the TV or movie rights to her books, afraid of losing creative control of her characters. However, when approached by PDM Entertainment and Attraction Images and offered a position as executive producer during film production, she changed her mind and agreed to sell them the rights to her first two novels. Still Life went into production in the fall of 2012, with British actor Nathaniel Parker cast as Chief Inspector Gamache. The movie aired on CBC TV in 2013.

Its Roman name derives from the local Celtic language, and may mean \\"fort of the raven\\".  History  The fort, built in the 230s, became later part of the Saxon Shore fortification system. It was built to guard the Wash approaches and is of a typical rectangular castrum layout.Johnston, D.E.(ed.)Council for British Archaeology Report 18: The Saxon Shore, 1975, pp.3-5 According to the 4th-century document Notitia Dignitatum, the fort was garrisoned by the Equites Dalmatae Brandodunenses (\\"Dalmatian cavalry of Bran[d]odunum\\"),Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Occ., XXVIII.16 although a tile found on the site stamped Cohors I Aquitanorum suggests that its original garrison was the \\"First cohort from Aquitania\\".Johnston, D.E.(ed.)Council for British Archaeology Report 18: The Saxon Shore, 1975, pp. 8 & 27 There is possible evidence (burials and grave goods) of later Saxon use of the site.Johnston, D.E.(ed.)Council for British Archaeology Report 18: The Saxon Shore, 1975, p.29 According to the National Trust notice boards present on the site of the fort, the fort is within a rectangular field to the east of the current village of Brancaster; there is no urban development on the fort's site itself. Urban residential development in the 1970s has covered much of the area to the west of the fort where part of the local 'vicus' (surrounding civilian settlement) was situated.  Location and construction  The site is bounded by the modern village of Brancaster to the west, and the A149 road to the south. The site is maintained by the National Trust. Free access is possible from the adjoining A149 road or the Norfolk Coastal Walk. In Roman times, the fort's northern wall lay directly on the seashore, which served as a harbour. Since then, the shoreline has receded, and the fort now lies inland. The fort was of a rectangular shape with rounded corners, with a wide wall with internal turrets at the corners and backed by an earthen rampart, which increased the wall's strength and gave easy access to the battlements. In front of the wall there was a V-shaped single ditch.Fields, p. 25 The wall thus enclosed an area of 2.56 ha.CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore, p. 25 In typical castrum fashion, the fort had four gates, one on each side. Evidence of the eastern and western gates and of flanking towers survives. Aerial survey has revealed the existence of several buildings in the fort's interior, including the principia. A civilian settlement (vicus) existed on the eastern and northern sidesBrancaster (Branodunum) http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf?titleId=1844165 of the fort, which has been dated to the 2nd century AD. Its size would make it one of the largest settlements in the territory of the Iceni tribe.CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore, p. 29 Because the streets of the settlement are not aligned with the layout of the fort, it has been hypothesised that an earlier fort, built of timber, existed at the site, possibly from as early as the revolt of Queen Boudicca in the mid-1st century AD. The walls still stood up to tall in the seventeenth century, but robbing of materials during following centuries means that only the site and the earthworks now remain.BRANODUNUM: Archaeology Data Service http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf?titleId=1060797 The site provided the subject of an episode of archaeological television programme Time Team first broadcast in January 2013.

She operated as SS Saint John from 1932 to 1941 before she was acquired by the U.S. Navy and renamed Antaeus. From 1941 to 1943, she was employed as a submarine tender; she was later redesignated AG-67 and used as a transport for troops from 1943 to 1944. In 1945, she was converted to a hospital ship, renamed USS Rescue (AH-18), and served in the Pacific War. Decommissioned in 1946, she was sold for scrap in 1958.  Civilian service  SS St. John was built in 1932 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia and was operated as a passenger liner by the Eastern Steamship Lines. St. John, along with her sister ship the SS Acadia, entered coastal service for New York-Yarmouth- Halifax or Saint John. From 1938-1940 the vessel also ran in New York-Bermuda or Nassau service. In 1939, the vessel was chartered to the United States Lines for one voyage to carry American construction workers to air base projects in Bermuda. Acquired by the Navy on 24 April 1941 the ship was renamed Antaeus (AS-21) and commissioned on 17 May 1941, Comdr. R. S. Morse in command.  World War II service   Operations as USS Antaeus  Following her commissioning, the submarine tender operated in the Caribbean. She took part in training exercises and made repairs to the American submarines patrolling in those waters. Antaeus finished this task in September 1943, when she was assigned to transport duties and was redesignated AG-67. The ship then began shuttling troops to points in the Caribbean, the Panama Canal Zone, and to Argentia, Newfoundland, from bases at New York City and Davisville, Rhode Island.  Conversion to hospital ship USS Rescue  Antaeus entered the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, on 28 December 1944. There, she underwent conversion to a hospital ship. On 18 January 1945, the vessel was renamed Rescue and redesignated (AH-18). Following a period of sea trials, the new hospital ship got underway for the Pacific Ocean theater of action. She arrived off Okinawa on 13 June, embarked men wounded in the fighting ashore, survived unscathed despite almost constant Japanese air attack against Allied shipping in the area, and safely delivered her patients to a hospital on Guam. With a bed capacity of 792 and a complement of 440, Rescue provided hospital services, consultation, preventative medicine, and casualty evacuation. After a short upkeep period, Rescue joined the U.S. 3d Fleet on 5 July. She supported 3d Fleet ships conducting carrier strikes and bombardment of the Japanese home islands. The ship would rendezvous with the combatant vessels and take on casualties by breeches buoy both at night and under battle conditions. Upon the conclusion of World War II, Rescue sailed into Tokyo Bay with the 3d Fleet and began the medical screening of Allied prisoners of war and shuttling them from various prison camps to the base at Yokohama.  Post-war activity  In late September, the ship arrived at Guam where she discharged a few former prisoners whose home had been on that island. Rescue then proceeded to San Francisco, California. She was decommissioned on 29 June 1946 and was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration. She was stricken from the Navy List on 15 August 1946. The vessel was subsequently refitted as a merchant ship and saw service as such from 1946 into 1958, in which year she was scrapped.

The Argyll Group is a thick sequence of metamorphosed Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks that outcrop across the Central Highlands of Scotland, east of the Great Glen, as well as appearing in the north of Ireland. It is a subdivision of the Dalradian Supergroup and is itself divided into four units; from oldest to youngest these are the Islay, Easdale, Crinan and Tayvallich subgroups.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=ARGY Islay Subgroup The lower boundary of the Islay Subgroup and hence the Argyll Group as a whole is defined at the base of the Port Askaig tillite, a diamictite which displays limestone clasts overlain by quartzite and granite clasts. The tillite is thickest in its type area and on the Garvellachs. The Schiehallion Boulder Bed of the eastern Grampians correlates with this tillite. The tillite is overlain by the Bonahaven Dolomite and then the Jura Quartzite which can reach up to 5km thick but which is more typically between 500 and 1000m thick. Psammites and pelites occur within the sequence in the Ladder Hills area.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=DBIS Easdale Subgroup The Easdale Subgroup consists of a basal Scarba Conglomerate overlain by the Craignish Phyllite. It also includes pelites, semipelites, psammites and some volcaniclastic rocks. Extending between Jura, Knapdale and the Moray Firth coast, the unit can reach to 3km thick.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=DBED Crinan Subgroup The Crinan Subgroup is formed by the Crinan Grits Formation, a submarine fan deposit. These rocks which are between 1.5 and 3km thick, extend the width of Scotland from Kintyre to Fraserburgh. Their base is characterised by a coarse quartzite in Argyll, otherwise it is formed from pelites, semipelites and psammites.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=DBCN Tayvallich Subgroup The lithology of this subgroup varies across Scotland but is dominantly limestone though this is replaced in the east by psammite and quartzite.

It stars Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, Danny Aiello, Laura San Giacomo and Gena Rowlands and was written by Malia Scotch Marmo and directed by Lasse Hallstr√∂m. Plot The Bellas are a close-knit family of Italian-Americans living in Boston, Massachusetts. Joe, the head of the family, owns a construction company. He has been married to Marilyn for 34 years and they have three children‚ÄîRenata, Tony and Jan. Jan (the youngest) is about to get married, leading introverted Renata (the eldest and only one not married) to wonder why her boyfriend Rob has not yet proposed to her. Once Rob reveals that he never plans on marrying her, she leaves him and moves back in with her parents. Renata travels to the Caribbean, where she takes a course on selling condominiums. She meets Sam Sharpe, a highly successful Lithuanian- American salesman who makes a speech at a training seminar. They are instantly attracted to each other, and Sam accompanies her back to Boston, where Renata introduces him to her family. The chain-smoking, abrasive Sam is overly eager to please. While the majority of the Bellas give Sam a chance, Jan seems to have a particular dislike of him. This upsets Renata and the siblings' rapport becomes strained. Jan eventually apologizes and gives Renata her blessing. Sam and Renata get married, with Sam relocating his business from New York to Boston so he can spend as much time with Renata as possible. At a memorial for Joe's late mother, Sam attempts to sing a song in her honor, but the Bellas, especially Marilyn, tell him it is highly inappropriate. Renata tells Sam he is tearing her family apart. They reconcile, and the next day Renata gives birth to their daughter. At the baptism, Sam suffers a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital. Now in a wheelchair, Sam is welcomed home to the Bella residence to celebrate Christmas as a family. During dinner, he lights up a cigarette, which an irritated Renata throws into a glass of wine. On a frozen lake, Renata goes skating, while Sam and their daughter watch from a distance. Sam passes away while still holding his child. After the funeral, Renata mourns, but is grateful for the time they had together and for Sam changing her life for the better. Joe directs the funeral procession through several rotations on a traffic round-about, something Sam learned from his father-in- law and greatly enjoyed during his life.

Built c. 1850, it is the only surviving Greek Revival farmhouse on the west side of the city, and a reminder of the area's agrarian past. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Thomas Cook House stands in the dense residential area of northwestern Somerville. It stands on the north side of a bend in College Hill Road, a short side street between North Street and Conwell Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The building corners have pilasters, which rise to a full entablature and fully pedimented gable ends. The main entrance is at the center of a side-facing three-bay facade, with a gabled pediment above. That pediment, and a finish strip between the first and second floors, are both later stylistic modifications to the house. The house was built about 1850 by Thomas Cook, a local farmer. This area of West Somerville was principally used for market gardens, and did not see development pressure until well after Tufts University was established on land to the east in 1852. Beginning in the 1880s the area was subdivided for residential development. This house, originally facing North Street to the west, was moved to its present location, and the surrounding land was eventually built over with two and three-family houses.

On May 8, 2013, Rosales hit what appeared to be a game tying home run, but was ruled a double despite the ball hitting a railing in left field and bouncing back onto the field. Umpire √Ångel Hern√°ndez reviewed the play and upheld the original ruling as a double. Following the controversial call, manager Bob Melvin was ejected for arguing and the A's lost to the Cleveland Indians 4‚Äì3. Rosales got a lot of starting time at shortstop with Jed Lowrie playing second base against left- handed pitchers.

Family He was one of ten children of James Martin \\"Jim\\" Myrick and his wife, the former Allie Artimissa Parker, tenant farmers who moved their family to West Carroll Parish in northeastern Louisiana, where they purchased their own farm shortly before the Great Depression. He was the brother of Louisiana State Senator W. Spencer Myrick (1918‚Äì1991). Life and career Spencer and Bill Myrick both at times worked for Governor Earl Kemp Long. Bill Myrick joined the United States Army directly out of high school at the start of World War II, and as a combat medic in the Pacific with tours of duty in Japan and the Philippines. Myrick returned to Louisiana after the war. His first professional singing job came by chance. He sat waiting to begin a temporary job putting up a tent at a circus, and was spotted picking his guitar and singing. He was immediately hired to fill a vacancy that had just occurred in the band of Bluegrass musician Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys. After a few years of performing at the Grand Ole Opry and on the road in concert with Monroe, Myrick put together the first professional bluegrass group Myrick and the Mayfield Brothers with the ranching Mayfield brothers, Edd, Herb, and Smokey, from the Texas Panhandle area of Dimmitt in Castro County. Myrick and the Mayfield Brothers performed on the Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport, Louisiana and became regulars on the show. Edd Mayfield was also invited to perform with Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys, precursors to the stylish, rancher look with starched and pressed blue jeans, crisp white shirts, cowboy hats, and cowboy boots, a look common in country music today but innovative in the 1950s. Bill Myrick moved his wife, Laverne S. Myrick (born 1930), and toddler daughter Bellinda Myrick (born 1948) to Odessa, the county seat of Ector County, on the advice on Myrick's friend Hank Williams. Myrick, who worked for the Odessa Police Department as a motorcycle officer in the traffic division while developing his music career became known in the Odessa area where country, bluegrass, and rockabilly music had become popular as \\"The Singing Policeman.\\" Myrick had been hired to perform with the Williams band as a singer and guitar player as well as driving Williams' personal Cadillac. Myrick had asked for a week or two to spend with his wife and daughter because he had been on the road extensively with Bill Monroe. Williams agreed but before Myrick could join Williams, the latter died in his vehicle en route to his next performance. Myrick was instrumental in the early successes of Roy Orbison, Buddy Holly, Patsy Cline, and Elvis Presley, whose recording career gained its first national momentum from Myrick's radio program, the Pioneer Jamboree, Myrick arranged the only joint appearance of Holly and Presley. Sony/RCA researcher Ernst Jorgensen has gathered critical evidence of Myrick's part in Presley's success. Presley appeared throughout West Texas and the Panhandle, sometimes with Myrick and the Rainbow Riders as the opening act. At the Ector Theater in Odessa, Myrick and Presley watched Presley's film Jailhouse Rock. Many Presley biographers, however, have reported that Presley never saw Jailhouse Rock because of grief over the death of co-star Judy Tyler and her husband in an automobile accident after the film had been completed. Myrick appeared on West Texas radio stations KECK, KOSA, and KOYL where he worked with his friend Waylon Jennings, who had earlier been a member of Buddy Holly and the Crickets and had known Myrick since Presley performed in Lubbock. As country music then did not pay most musicians well, Myrick assumed other paying jobs periodically, having worked as a peace officer and a truck driver. He and his wife had two more children, Martin and Billy. Life on the road traveling with Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, the Miller Brothers, Rex Allen of Arizona, and Jimmy Dean of Plainview, Texas, among others, took its toll. Myrick left behind his musical career and began a three-decade association with Big Three Industries, a major distributor of liquid oxygen to NASA and hospitals around the country. Big Three was later purchased by Air Liquide of France. He began driving trucks and ended his career as the transport and safety director. On retiring from the company, Myrick returned to his first love of bluegrass music creating the National Public Radio show Silvergrass and Purple Sage which has a following in Japan and among American military serving in Iraq. He is also a master of ceremonies at bluegrass festivals. He resides in Odessa with his wife, Laverne. He is a member of the choir at First Baptist Church in Odessa. The Myricks have three children, Bellinda Myrick, former Miss Texas and Miss West Texas, singer/actress/and author; Dr. Martin C. Myrick PhD., an author and musician who lives in Southern California; and Billy R. Myrick, now a retired Police Chief, residing in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex. In 2010, there were seven grandchildren and one great grandchild. Myrick was sometimes a guest host on the Odessa country music station KXWT. Bill Myrick received the Bronze Star medal on February 20, 2011 for his service during World War II in the U.S. Army as a Staff Sgt. and Combat Medic with the 25th Infantry Division, 35th Medical Detachment, Headquartered in Hawaii, seeing combat in the Pacific under General Douglas MacArthur. The award was presented before a standing room only crowd of nearly 2,000 people, including more than 30 family members, who flew in from around the country at the First Baptist Church in Odessa, Texas by U.S. Congressman Mike Conaway, just a few weeks before his death.

Like other members of Goodeinae, the redtail splitfin is native to Mexico and a livebearer. However, the goodeid mating system differs in several ways from the more common livebearing fish from the family Poeciliidae that includes guppies and swordtails. While no goodeid species is a very popular aquarium fish, the redtail splitfin is one of the most popular. Only the male has the red-orange tail for which it is named. Its specific name honours the collector of the type, Gustav Eisen (1847‚Äì1940) who was Curator of Marine Invertebrates at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, California. Range and habitat San Marcos variant was formerly included in X. eiseni, but in 2016 it was described as a separate species, X. doadrioi The redtail splitfin comes from west-central Mexico in the Grande de Santiago River basin and waters near Compostela, Nayarit. It might also occur in the uppermost Ameca and Armer√≠a River basins, but the taxonomic position of these populations remains unclear. Two additional populations, one from an endorheic basin in the Etzatl√°n region and another from the Coahuayana River, were formerly included in this species, but in 2016 they were described as X. doadrioi and X. lyonsi respectively. The redtail splitfin inhabits springs, pools, lakes, creeks and rivers, typically in places with little or no aquatic vegetation. It prefers shallow waters. Description The redtail splitfin is a deep-bodied fish, and males have a hump behind the head. The hump gets larger as the males get older. Adult males have a red-orange tail and tail- base. The upper part of the body and head are olive-brownish to dusky. A broad, poorly defined bluish-black band runs from the gill cover to the tail, but it virtually disappears on the mid-body region. The throat and belly or yellowish to whitish. Females lack the red-orange and are overall more plainly colored. Females are generally slightly larger than males. Females grow to 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) while males grow to 6 centimeters (2.4 inches). Among goodeids, the distinct red-orange tail and tail-base is unique to the males of the redtail splitfin and its close relatives X. doadrioi and X. lyonsi. Breeding Male goodeids like the redtail splitfin have a notched anal fin that gives the fish the name \\"splitfin\\", instead of the gonopodium of poeciliids. This notched anal fin, or andropodium, is used to transmit sperm to the female. The female nourishes the unborn young via trophotaeniae, which function like an umbilical cord in mammals. Females give birth about every 2 months to 10 to 50 fry. The newborn redtail splitfin fry are relatively large compared to most newborn livebearer fry, at about 15 millimeters (2/3 of an inch) long. In the wild, both male and female redtail splitfins prefer to mate with fish of similar size. This limits the sexual advantage to males that grow especially large. This minimizes the sexual dimorphism in the size of the fish between males and females. Aquarium keeping The redtail splitfin is not a very common aquarium fish, but it is one of the most common goodeids to be kept in the aquarium. They are not very demanding in the aquarium, although they prefer hard, alkaline water. They can tolerate a wide range of water temperatures, from 15 to 30 degrees Celsius (59 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). They accept a wide range of foods, but do require some vegetable matter in their diets. Although they are generally peaceful, they are known to occasionally nip the fins of fellow aquarium residents. This behavior can be reduced by keeping the redtail splitfin in schools.

Its name derives from the local Celtic language, meaning \\"great headland\\" (*Rogulbion).  History  The first Roman military installation in the area was a small fort built directly after the invasion of Britain in the reign of Claudius, protected by earthworks. It was connected to Durovernum (Canterbury) by a road. The fort, strategically located at the entrance of the Wantsum Channel, possibly housed a signal tower, perhaps a lighthouse, and continued in operation at least until the late 60s, since coins dating to the reign of Nero were found on site. This structure lay within the bounds of the later, larger stone fort, which was built in the early 3rd century, probably in , since the sole stone inscription found at the fort (in 1960) mentions the then governor of Britain, Aulus Triarius Rufinus.Philp, Brian (1969). \\"The Reculver Inscription\\". Kent Archaeological Review (17). This construction occurred at a time when cities and strategic sites all over Western Europe were fortified in response to the greater threat posed by barbarian raids. The archaeological remains display another period of great activity towards the end of the century, the time of the Carausian Revolt, and again in the first half of the 4th century. However, it appears that after 360, the fort was abandoned by the Roman military. The masonry castrum at Reculver is unusually early for its location and type,Allen, J.R.L. & Fulford, M.G. (1999), \\"Fort Building and Military Supply along Britain's Eastern Channel and North Sea Coasts: The Later Second and Third Centuries\\", Britannia 30, pp. 163‚Äì4. but it can be compared in both age and design with the forts at Brancaster and Caister-on- Sea, both in Norfolk,; and it may be that \\"the east coast was in need of protection before the south coast, which was patrolled by the Roman navy, the Classis Britannica.\\". The design of the fort at Reculver can also be compared with those along Hadrian's Wall, in northern England.. The Notitia Dignitatum (whose western records date from the early 5th century but probably describe the situation at a slightly earlier date), reports the garrison at Reculver as the Cohors I Baetasiorum, and this is reflected in the discovery there of tiles stamped with the initials \\"CIB\\".. The Cohors I Baetasiorum were previously stationed at Maryport, in Cumbria, and, since they probably built the fort at Reculver, this may explain the similarity between it and the forts along Hadrian's Wall. After the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain, the site continued to be inhabited, and, now called Raculf, became a residence of the Kings of Kent. In 669, King Ecgberht of Kent founded a monastery on the site of the fort.Garmonsway, G.N., The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Dent, Dutton, 1972 & 1975, pp. 34-5. It clearly was important, since in 690, its abbot, Bertwald, became Archbishop of Canterbury. Herne Bay Museum display centred on the Roman fort at Reculver  Location and construction  The fort stood on the mainland side of the northern entrance to the mile-wide Wantsum Channel, which separated the Isle of Thanet from the mainland. The Channel was a favoured passage for shipping, and the fort was built to both control it and act as a navigational marker. The construction was typical of a Saxon Shore fort, square-shaped with rounded corners. The single rampart was 10 feet (3 m) thick at the base tapering to 8 feet (2.5m) at the top, with a height of probably 20 feet (6 m).

The fort covered an area of 3.06 ha, but almost half of that has been lost to the sea due to erosion.

The extends along Woburn Street from Summer Street to Temple Street, and includes sixteen houses on well-proportioned lots along an attractive tree-lined section of the street. The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Woburn Street is one of the oldest streets in Reading, with portions appearing on a map in 1765. The area remained rural until the late 19th century, when railroad-influenced suburban development resulted in the extension and development of the road. Four houses were built prior to this time: the c. 1795 house at 201 Woburn Street, a predominantly Federal-style house that was later modified with a Colonial Revival portico, is the oldest house in the district. Other houses from earlier in the 19th century are two Greek Revival and one Italianate style house, which was moved c. 1908 to the area to serve as the rectory for the Saint Agnes Church. A number of prominent individuals lived in the district. 206 Woburn Street, a Shingle style building, was the home of architect Horace G. Wadlin. Railroad owner Edward Appleton lived at 201 Woburn Street, as did shoemaker Daniel Pratt and architect Willard P. Adden. The house at 216 Woburn Street was owned by local hardware store owner Richard W. Francis. A founder and director of the First National Bank in Reading lived at 177 Woburn Street. Most of the houses in the district are either Colonial Revival or Queen Anne in styling; even one of the early Greek Revival houses was refashioned in Queen Anne style. Houses at 183 Woburn Street and 228 Woburn Street are good examples of Colonial Revival style. There is one Craftsman-style house, at 207 Woburn Street.

History The village was first established in 1912 on land bought from Bia≈Çystok Jews, and served as an agricultural training place. Amongst the residents were A. D. Gordon. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Kfar Uria had a population of 40 Jews. This had decreased in 1931 to 10 inhabitants, in 2 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 21 In the 1929 Palestine riots Arab rioters from Jerusalem attacked Kfar Uria, with some local help, robbed and burned down the village. The inhabitants of the adjacent Arab villages for the most part were on good terms with the village's residents and many treated the moshav's association director, Baruch Yakimovsky, as their mukhtar (village chief). He was on amicable terms with mukhtars in surrounding villages. The farmers of the area, both Jews and Arabs, cooperated and defended each other against raiding nomadic Bedouin. Six Jewish families who had stayed behind were later smuggled out by the mukhtar of Beit Far via one of the ancient natural tunnels that crisscrosses the area. Yakimovsky managed, with the cooperation of some local mukhtars to work Kfar Uria's land for a few more years. In 1944, Jewish stonecutters from Kurdistan rebuilt the village on the ruins of the original site, around 1.5 km north-west Khirbat Ism Allah, but not on village land.

A third attempt to settle the area was undertaken in 1949, when a moshav was established on the site. The village name is similar to that of Khirbet Cafarorie, a ruin located south - west of the village, which had a hewn winepress, a mosaic and burial caves. The village center features an old Khan, which once hosted the agricultural training workers, including A. D. Gordon. The Khan structure remains to this day at the heart of the community, but it requires renovations and therefore closed to visitors. Between 2009 and 2011 a new neighborhood was built and populated with 69 new houses and families.

Built in the early 1850s, it is an excellent example of an early Italianate design. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Alden Batchelder House stands north of downtown Reading, on a triangular parcel of land at the junction of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28) and Charles Street, across Main Street from the Laurel Hill Cemetery. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side-gable roof and clapboarded exterior. It is oriented facing south, and is screened from the streets on either side by trees; a stone retaining wall lines the properties eastern and western sides. The roof has relatively deep eaves, studded with a few single decorative brackets. At the center of the main facade there is a gable at the roof line, which is echoed in the roof of the single-story porch, which wraps around the side of the house. The porch features turned balusters and posts. The first-floor windows are elongated, with deep moldings. The house was built in 1849 by Alden Batchelder, and represents an early form of the Italianate style. The house has a basically Georgian or Federal form, but its decorative elements are clearly Italianate. Alden Batchelder was a local cabinetmaker, a common trade in the town at the time. His business was successful, employing 25 workers in 1864. It was destroyed by fire in 1876, after which he moved the business to Charlestown, where he employed prisoners from the Charlestown State Prison.

Performance-based advertising is becoming more common with the spread of electronic media, notably the Internet, where it is possible to measure user actions resulting from advertisement. Performance Marketing is different from Brand Marketing which focuses on awareness, consideration and opinions among target consumers.  Pricing models  There are four common pricing models used in the online performance advertising market. CPM (cost- per-mille, or cost-per-thousand) pricing models charge advertisers for impressions, i.e. the number of times people view an advertisement. Display advertising is commonly sold on a CPM pricing model. The problem with CPM advertising is that advertisers are charged even if the target audience does not click on the advertisement. CPC (cost-per-click) advertising overcomes this problem by charging advertisers only when the consumer clicks on the advertisement. However, due to increased competition, search keywords have become very expensive. A 2007 Doubleclick Performics Search trends Report shows that there were nearly six times as many keywords with a cost per click (CPC) of more than $1 in January 2007 than the prior year. The cost per keyword increased by 33% and the cost per click rose by as much as 55%. In recent times, there has been a rapid increase in online lead generation ‚Äì banner and direct response advertising that works off a CPL pricing model. In a cost-per-lead pricing model, advertisers pay only for qualified leads ‚Äì irrespective of the clicks or impressions that went into generating the lead. CPL advertising is also commonly referred to as online lead generation. Cost per lead (CPL) pricing models are the most advertiser friendly. A recent IBM research study found that two-thirds of senior marketers expect 20 percent of ad revenue to move away from impression-based sales, in favor of action-based models within three years. CPL models allow advertisers to pay only for qualified leads as opposed to clicks or impressions and are at the pinnacle of the online advertising ROI hierarchy. In CPA advertising, or Cost Per Acquisition, advertisers pay for a specific action such as a credit card transaction (also called CPO, cost-per-order). Advertisers need to be careful when choosing between CPL and CPA pricing models. In CPL campaigns, advertisers pay for an interested lead ‚Äì i.e. the contact information of a person interested in the advertiser's product or service. CPL campaigns are suitable for brand marketers and direct response marketers looking to engage consumers at multiple touch-points ‚Äì by building a newsletter list, community site, reward program or member acquisition program. In CPA campaigns, the advertiser typically pays for a completed sale involving a credit card transaction. CPA is all about 'now' ‚Äì it focuses on driving consumers to buy at that exact moment. If a visitor to the website doesn't buy anything, there's no easy way to re-market to them. There are other important differentiators: # CPL campaigns are advertiser-centric. The advertiser remains in control of their brand, selecting trusted and contextually relevant publishers to run their offers. On the other hand, CPA and affiliate marketing campaigns are publisher-centric. Advertisers cede control over where their brand will appear, as publishers browse offers and pick which to run on their websites. Advertisers generally do not know where their offer is running. # CPL campaigns are usually high volume and light-weight. In CPL campaigns, consumers submit only basic contact information. The transaction can be as simple as an email address. On the other hand, CPA campaigns are usually low volume and complex. Typically, consumer has to submit credit card and other detailed information. CPL advertising is more appropriate for advertisers looking to deploy acquisition campaigns by re-marketing to end consumers through e-newsletters, community sites, reward programs, loyalty programs and other engagement vehicles.  Economic benefits  Many advertisers have limited budgets and may not understand the most effective method of advertising. With performance-based advertising plans, they avoid the risk of paying large amounts for advertisements that are ineffective. They pay only for results. The advertising agency, distributor or publisher assumes the risk, and is therefore motivated to ensure that the advertisement is well- targeted, making best use of the available inventory of advertising space. Electronic media publishers may choose advertisements based on location, time of day, day of week, demographics and performance history, ensuring that they maximize revenue earned from each advertising slot. The close attention to targeting is intended to minimize the number of irrelevant advertisements presented to consumers. They see advertisements for products and services that are likely to interest them. Although consumers often state that advertisements are irritating, in many situations they find the advertisement useful if they are relevant.  Metrics  Various types of measurable action may be used in charging for performance-based advertising: * Many Internet sites charge for advertising on a \\"CPM\\" (cost per thousand) or cost per impression basis. That is, the advertiser pays only when a consumer sees their advertisement. Some would argue that this is not performance-based advertising since there is no measurement of the user response. * Internet sites often also offer advertising on a \\"PPC\\" (pay per click) basis. Google's AdWords product and equivalent products from Millennial Media, Yahoo!, Microsoft and others support PPC advertising plans. * A small but growing number of sites are starting to offer plans on a \\"Pay per call\\" basis. The user can click a button to place a VoIP call, or to request a call from the advertiser. If the user requests a call, presumably they are highly likely to make a purchase. * Finally, there is considerable research into methods of linking the user's actions to the eventual purchase: the ideal form of performance measurement. Some Internet sites are markets, bringing together buyers and sellers. eBay is a prominent example of a market operating on an auction basis. Other market sites let the vendors set their price. In either model, the market mediates sales and takes a commission ‚Äì a defined percentage of the sale value. The market is motivated to give a more prominent position to vendors who achieve high sales value. Markets may be seen as a form of performance-based advertising. The use of mobile coupons also enables a whole new world of metrics within identifying campaign effect. There are several providers of mobile coupon technology that makes it possible to provide unique coupons or barcodes to each individual person and at the same time identify the person downloading it. This makes it possible to follow these individuals during the whole process from downloading until when and where the coupons are redeemed.  Media  Although the Internet introduced the concept of performance-based advertising, it is now spreading into other media. The mobile telephone is increasingly used as a web browsing device, and can support both pay-per-click and pay-per-call plans. Coupons delivered to the mobile handset can be used to link advertising direct to sales. As consumers start to use their mobile handset as an electronic payment device, it may become practical to establish direct linkage between advertising and purchases. The linkage may be indirect. A consumer may use their mobile phone to scan a barcode on an outdoor advertisement. This loads the advertiser's mobile site onto the phone. When the consumer shortly afterwards goes to the advertiser's store and uses their phone to make a purchase, the linkage can be inferred. Directory assistance providers are starting to introduce advertising, particularly with \\"Free DA\\" services such as the Jingle Networks 1-800-FREE-411, the AT&T; 1-800-YELLOWPAGES and the (now-defunct) Google 1-800-GOOG-411. The advertiser pays when a caller listens to their advertisement, the equivalent of Internet CPM advertising, when they ask for additional information, or when they place a call. IPTV promises to eventually combine features of cable television and the Internet. Viewers may see advertisements in a sidebar that are relevant to the show they are watching. They may click on an advertisement to obtain more details, and this action can be measured and used to charge the advertiser. It is even possible to directly measure the performance of print advertising. The publisher prints a special telephone number in the advertisement, used nowhere else. When a consumer places a call to that number, the call event is recorded and the call is routed to the regular number. In theory, the call could only have been generated because of the print advertisement. In practice, there is the risk that an inadvertent third party will find a number from an advertisement and submit it to an online or printed directory, causing it to receive additional calls for which the advertiser must pay individually as \\"leads\\" or enquiries. Some of the received calls may be misdirected product support requests from existing clients or even enquiries from suppliers, which are not new revenue and should not be counted as new leads. Toll-free telephone numbers are also notoriously prone to misdials which a company must pay to receive - often because a little-used number is one digit away from a major airline, hotel chain, hire car firm, bank or national franchise operator.  Pricing  A publisher may charge defined prices for performance- based advertising, so much per click or call, but it is common for prices to be set through some form of \\"bidding\\" or auction arrangement. The advertiser states how much they are willing to pay for a user action, and the publisher provides feedback on how much other advertisers have offered. The actual amount paid may be lower than the amount bid, for example 1 cent more than the next highest bidder. A \\"bidding\\" plan does not guarantee that the highest bidder will always be presented in the most prominent advertising slot, or will gain the most user actions. The publisher will want to earn the maximum revenue from each advertising slot, and may decide (based on actual results) that a lower bidder is likely to bring more revenue than a higher bidder - they will pay less but be selected more often. In a competitive market, with many advertisers and many publications, defined prices and bid-based prices are likely to converge on the generally accepted value of an advertising action. This presumably reflects the expected sale value and the profit that will result from the sale. An item like a hotel room or airplane seat that loses all value if not sold may be priced at a higher ratio of sale value than an item like a bag of sand or box of nails that will retain its value over time. A number of companies provide products or services to help optimize the bidding process, including deciding which keywords the advertiser should bid on and which sites will give best performance. Other companies that offer straightforward pay for performance lead generation services, offer performance based pricing related to the quality or quantity of the lead.  Issues  There is the potential for fraud in performance-based advertising. * The publication may report excessive performance results, although a reputable publication would be unlikely to take the risk of being exposed by audit. * A competitor may arrange for automatically generated clicks on an advertisement Since the user's actions are being measured, there are serious concerns of loss of privacy. Performance-based advertising mechanisms induce firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upwards) relative to prices that would maximize profits in settings where advertising is sold under established pay-per-impression methods. Upward price distortions reduce both consumer surplus and the joint publisher-advertiser profit, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. Dellarocas (2010) discusses a number of ways in which performance-based advertising mechanisms can be enhanced to restore efficient pricing.

A smaller two-story ell projects to the right side at a recess. The property on which the house stands was long under ownership of the locally prominent Batchelder family, whose homestead was known to be standing here about 1703. The property passed to Nathaniel Batchelder about 1783, and he is said to have built the present house on the location of the old homestead. Batchelder was a farmer and shoemaker, and his descendants continued to own the property and be involved in those trades through the 19th century.

Wildlife and habitat Eighteen miles long and up to wide, the refuge consists of over of bottomland hardwood forest, of upland forest, of shrub/wooded swamp, of reforested farmland, and of open water. About 80% of the refuge is subject to annual flooding from December through May. The central physical feature is the Ouachita River, which bisects the refuge. The river's wide floodplain is characterized by alluvial soils. Refuge supports concentrations of ducks, geese, wading birds, raptors and a small wintering population of bald eagles. The refuge provides excellent wintering habitat for tens of thousands of ducks and geese. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker and the threatened Louisiana black bear are found on Upper Ouachita NWR. Other wildlife species that call the refuge home include alligators, deer, turkey, squirrels, bald eagles and beaver. Upper Ouachita NWR is one of the four refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuge Complex. Management Selective thinning and water level manipulation is conducted within the bottomland hardwoods for the benefit of migratory birds, resident wildlife and the overall health of the forest. Reforestation of bottomland hardwoods has taken place on the east side of the refuge. Emphasis was placed on planting the tree species that grew there historically. Approximately of the refuge are managed as moist soil units. These wetland units are managed for the benefit of waterfowl, shorebirds and other wildlife. Water levels are manipulated to produce high quality natural foods such as wild millets, grasses and sedges. Cooperative farming occurs on a rotational basis in portions of the refuge to provide food for wintering waterfowl. The upland mixed pine hardwood forest on the western portion of the refuge is managed for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker through thinning and prescribed fire. Installing artificial cavity inserts and woodpecker banding and occasional transplanting are also important management tools. Other management practices include wood duck nest box project, fish stocking, and removal of exotic, invasive plants and animals.

Description and history The Benjamin Beard House stands south of downtown Reading, at the southwest corner of Ash Street and Avon Street. Ash Street is a feeder road providing access to southeastern Reading from the center, and Avon Street is a short connector between it and Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28). The house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, single off-center interior chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is laid out in what was a fairly common local variant, with the long spine of the house parallel to the street, and set on a slightly raised mound. There are pilasters on the corners, and the front entry has a somewhat tall Federal style high entablature, with sidelight windows and plain side molding supporting a corniced entablature. A single-story ell extends to the rear of the main block. The house was probably built in the early 1850s. Benjamin Beard, its first owner, was the town's first jeweler, opening a store in 1847 after having previously worked for a local clock- and watchmaker.

Founded in 1936, the League included some of the most noted American photographers of the mid-20th century among its members. It ceased operations in 1951 following its placement in 1947 on the U.S. Department of Justice blacklist with accusations that it was a communist, anti-American organization.  Origins  The League's origins traced back to a project of the Workers International Relief (WIR), a communist association based in Berlin. In 1930 the WIR established the Workers Camera League in New York City, which soon came to be known as the Film and Photo League. Its goals were to ‚Äústruggle against and expose reactionary film; to produce documentary films reflecting the lives and struggles of the American workers; and to spread and popularize the great artistic and revolutionary Soviet productions‚Äù.  Ethos  In 1934 the still photographers and the filmmakers in the League began having differences of opinion over social and production interests, and by 1936 they had formed separate groups. Paul Strand and Ralph Steiner established Frontier Films, to continue promoting the original goals, while Strand and Berenice Abbott renamed the original group ‚ÄúThe Photo League‚Äù. The two organizations remained friendly, with members of each group often participating in activities of the other. The goal of the newly reformed Photo League was to ‚Äúput the camera back into the hands of honest photographers who ... use it to photograph America‚Äù. The League quickly became active in the new field of socially conscious photography. Unlike other photography organizations, it did not espouse a particular visual style but instead concentrated on ‚Äúintegrating formal elements of design and visual aesthetics with the powerful and sympathetic evidence of the human condition‚Äù. It also offered basic and advanced classes in photography when there were few such courses in colleges or trade schools. A newsletter, Photo Notes, was printed irregularly, depending upon who was available to do the work and if they could afford the printing costs. More than anything else, though, the League was a gathering place for photographers to share and experience their common artistic and social interests.Tucker (2001), pp 12‚Äì13  Influential members  Among the members of the League were co-founders Sol Libsohn and Sid Grossman (director of the Photo League School); Morris Engel (from 1936); Arthur Leipzig (from 1942); Ruth Orkin, Jerome Liebling, and Lester Talkington (all from 1947); Walter Rosenblum (editor of the Photo League Photo Notes); Eliot Elisofon (a Life magazine photographer); Aaron Siskind; Jack Manning (a member of the Harlem Document Group of the League and a New York Times photographer); Dan Weiner; Bill Witt; Martin Elkort; Lou Bernstein; Sy Kattelson; Louis Stettner; and Lisette Model.These are the names singled out by Time-Life in its volume on the documentary (1971).  Women photographers  Unusually for artist groups at the time, about one third of League members and participants were women and they served in visible leadership roles such as secretary, treasurer, vice president, and president. For example, Lucy Ashjian, who joined the League as early as 1936, was Photo Notes editor and board chair of the League's school. Sonia Handelman Meyer was both photographer and secretary, the league's only paid position. In the early 1940s the list of notable photographers who were active in the League or supported their activities also included Margaret Bourke-White, W. Eugene Smith, Helen Levitt, FSA photographer Arthur Rothstein, Beaumont Newhall, Nancy Newhall, Richard Avedon, Weegee, Robert Frank, Harold Feinstein, Ansel Adams, Edward Weston and Minor White. The League was the caretaker of the Lewis Hine Memorial Collection, which Hine's son had given the League in recognition of its role in fostering social activism through photography as his father had done.Tucker (2001), p 162  Blacklisting  Many of the members who joined before the end of World War II were first-generation Americans who strongly believed in progressive political and social causes. Few were aware of the political origins of the movement of the communist \\"Workers as Photographers\\" (Arbeiterfotografen) in Berlin. This had in fact little to do with what the organization did as it evolved, but helped its downfall after the war, when it was accused by the FBI of being communist, subversive and anti-American. In December 1947, the Photo League was formally declared a subversive and placed on a U.S. Department of Justice blacklist of subversive organizations by Attorney General Tom C. Clark. Following this announcement, the Photo League appeared on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO) published on March 20, 1948, in the Federal Register. At first the League fought back and mounted an impressive This Is the Photo League exhibition in 1948, but after its member and long-time FBI informer Angela Calomiris had testified in May 1949 that the League was a front organization for the Communist Party, the Photo League was finished. Recruitment dried up and old members left, including one of its founders and former president, Paul Strand, as well as Louis Stettner. The League disbanded in 1951. After the League's demise, and with the return of more women to domestic roles in the postwar era, the careers of many promising women artists, such as Sonia Handelman Meyer and Rae Russel, did not continue.  Legacy  The Photo League was the subject of a 2012 documentary film: Ordinary Miracles: The Photo League's New York by Daniel Allentuck and Nina Rosenblum. The film traces the rise and demise of the Photo League between 1936 and 1951, and includes interviews with surviving members and a soundtrack including Woody Guthrie, the Andrews Sisters, and the Mills Brothers. Cineaste Magazine calls the film a \\"fine addition to the library of documentaries dedicated to remembering the cultural work of the old left.\\"Cineaste, vol. 37 no. 4. Fall 2012, p. 80\\\\.

Oz.) were a piano-based, power pop band from Murfreesboro, Tennessee that garnered a cult following for their critically acclaimed records, which featured a distinctive blend of hooks, varied musical styles, clever wordplay, and intricate, complex arrangements.Ridley, Jim. \\"Ounces of Invention.\\" Nashville Scene, 1999. Inception Seth Timbs had been writing his own songs on both guitar and piano for years. By the time he had formed Seth Timbs & The Mad Hatters, he had already accumulated a rather large back catalog. After the Mad Hatters, Timbs played in the band Ella Minopy with his good friend Matt Mahaffey. Once Ella broke up, Timbs joined with Ella‚Äôs bassist, Ben Morton, along with Elijah Shaw and local music legend/drummer Sam Baker (of local bands like the F Particles, These Are Houseplants, Blind Farmers, and Speake, among others) to form a new band. Timbs' long-time collaborator/friend, Brian ‚ÄúTha B‚Äù Rogers, briefly joined Self, the new band with Ella‚Äôs drummer Matt Mahaffey, but ultimately decided to work on Timbs' new project. The new band called itself Fl. Oz. (going by ‚ÄúFluid Ounces‚Äù would come later when people didn‚Äôt understand the band name in its abbreviated form) and began playing and recording in 1996 in Murfreesboro and Nashville, TN on the newly formed Spongebath Records. Sound Their sound was catchy piano pop, influenced by the likes of Elton John, Harry Nilsson, The Beatles, Elvis Costello, Ray Charles, They Might Be Giants, XTC, Randy Newman, and Thelonious Monk, and with their combined love of jazz, they created a very energetic sound with (mostly) upbeat tempos and complicated chord progressions. Because of the prominence of piano in the songs, the band often was often compared with contemporaries Ben Folds Five. However, as Stewart Mason with Allmusic noted: > \\"Unlike Folds' strained \\"look at me\\" cleverness, ivories-tickling leader > Seth Timbs doesn't draw too much attention to himself lyrically, and his > cohorts...[were] a much more cohesive and musically capable unit than the > Five were.\\"\\"[ Fluid Ounces > Overview]\\". Allmusic. History With this line-up, they recorded their first release, Big Notebook for Easy Piano, with producer Ross Rice of Memphis band Human Radio behind the console. Big Notebook for Easy Piano, released in June 1997, garnered dozens of positive reviews from publications such as Alternative Press, Magnet, CMJ, The Tennessean, Nashville Scene, and Billboard, and was eventually nominated for Rock Album of the Year by the Nashville Music Association. After months of continued gigging and building a fan base, the band then recorded their follow-up album, In the New Old-Fashioned Way, in Jackson, Mississippi with producer Richard Dortch. The recording for their second album was done live with minimal overdubs‚Äîthe opposite approach they had taken with their debut album. Their following in and around Nashville grew, and the band began touring around the country, especially after scoring a minor radio hit with ‚ÄúVegetable Kingdom.‚Äù In 1999, just before the official release of the second record, drummer Sam Baker left the band and was replaced by Justin Meyer. During this time, the band all shared a house together on Broad Street in Murfreesboro, sandwiched between a car dealership and a gravestone salesman, a fact that many journalists found humorous considering Timbs' fondness for noir themes and dark humor. In the New Old Fashioned Way was also reviewed very positively in press outlets like Ink19, PopMatters, Nashville Scene, Amplifier, Audiocafe, and Lollipop. This line-up continued gigging, and temporarily based themselves out of Chicago for midwest touring. Eventually, the band began working on songs for the third LP. Rogers and Morton then left in 1999 around the time the band parted ways with Spongebath Records. They were succeeded by Doug Payne (on guitar) and Jason Dietz (on bass). Meyer moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 2000, and Elliott Currie took his place on the drum throne. This line-up continued working on the third release, called Foreign Legion, which was completed sometime around January 2001. Trev Wooten took over the bass duties in March 2001, and Sam Baker re-joined the following May as the band prepared to promote the release of the new record. The band was then signed to Cutti Records in Japan and began scoring success overseas. Seth Timbs made several trips to Japan in order to promote the music, and he took the whole band with him in February 2002. After that, the band essentially broke up as Seth moved to Los Angeles and the other members went on to other projects. Seth recorded the fourth album, The Whole Shebang, with Spike and Mallets drummer Kyle Walsh in hopes of releasing it in Japan. Instead, the album was released nationwide by Murfreesboro-based Vacant Cage Records as Seth returned to Middle Tennessee. Upon his return, Seth re-formed Fluid Ounces with Brian Rogers back on guitar, Brian G. Pitts on bass, and Kyle Walsh on drums. Fluid Ounces recorded one more album, Instant Nostalgia, before disbanding in 2008. (Band history borrowed from \\"Hung On Every Word,\\" a blog about Fluid Ounces at fluidounces.blogspot.com) Seth Timbs formed a guitar based band called Hot New Singles from 2007-2010.

The film was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starred George C. Scott, Hart Bochner, Claire Bloom, Gilbert Roland, and David Hemmings.Variety film review; March 9, 1977, page 16. Plot Artist Thomas Hudson is an American who has left the civilized world for a simple life in the Caribbean. Schaffner tells the tale in four parts: *The Island - Introduces Hudson and the people he knows. It is set in The Bahamas, circa 1940. Tom is concerned about his friend Eddy, who loves to drink and brawl with anyone he finds. Later the residents of the island and Tom celebrate the Queen Mother's anniversary. *The Boys - Weeks after the celebrations for the Queen Mother, Tom is reunited with his three sons. It is a bittersweet reunion, because he left them and his wife Audrey four years before. Later they go on a challenging fishing trek to catch a Marlin. The segment ends as the boys return to the United States, where oldest son Tom joins the Royal Air Force in time for the Battle of Britain. Their father writes and tells them in a monologue how much he misses them. *The Woman - Tom's wife Audrey is introduced. She turns up unexpectedly and Tom wonders if she wants to get back together. Tom has already told his oldest son that he has never loved anyone else. However, she reveals that she is getting married again, although she clearly still has feelings for Tom. Tom is puzzled about why she has returned and angry, then realises why - she is there to tell him that young Tom is dead. They comfort each other, then she leaves, as planned. *The Journey - Tom attempts to help refugees escape the Nazis. He is accompanied by Joseph and Eddy. Leaving the British-owned Bahamas for the waters near neutral Cuba, Tom finds the refugees and tries to conduct them to the port of Havana, and ultimately to the U.S. He worries that he may not be able to trust Eddy, that the refugees may not survive the voyage, and this trip may be suicide for all concerned if they face the Cuban Coast Guard. Just short of their goal, a Cuban gunboat appears, but Tom saves his passengers by staging a diversion for the Cuban sailors, and the refugees reach dry land. Tom hopes to save his own ship by spilling fuel onto the water, which he then ignites. While Tom's crew survives, he is cut down by gunfire from the Cuban boat. As he hovers between life and death, Tom has a vision of his beloved house by the sea, now empty. There he is joined by Audrey and his sons. They embrace and then leave the house. Knowing that his life is about to end, Tom muses that he was very lucky to have the life he had. Cast * George C.

The district is centered on the town common, at the intersection of Main and Salem Streets. The common has been communally owned since at least 1737, with the original burying ground (expanded in the 19th century, and now known as Laurel Hill Cemetery) to the north. In 1769 the area's first meeting house (church and civic building) was built, giving the area a sense of identity separate from portions of Reading that would later be set off as Wakefield and North Reading. Since then the area has become a focal point for religious and civic institutions in the town. The most prominent feature of the district is the First Congregational Church, a 1913 replica of an 1817 church designed by Asher Benjamin that was destroyed by fire. The other church in the district is the stone Gothic Revival Christian Science Church on the west side of the common. The west side also includes the major municipal buildings: the library and town hall are brick Georgian Revival buildings dating to the early 20th century, as does the similarly-styled old high school building. There are also a few houses in the district, although a number of the older houses originally within its boundaries were moved to make way for some of the municipal buildings. One of the older houses is the 1817 Federal style house and shop of Thomas Pratt, located at the northeastern corner of the district. There is a row of 19th- century houses along Harnden and Salem Streets on the east side of the district. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Bassett House is set on the north side of Prescott Street, a residential through street to the west of Reading's central business district. Facing south, it is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a front-gable roof and clapboard siding. Its Greek Revival features include corner pilasters and a wide frieze that encircles the house, and a fully pedimented gable, which is not usually found on period houses in Reading. A single-story hip-roofed porch extends across the front facade, supported by Doric columns. The house follows a typical side hall plan; its entry is flanked by flat pilasters. Prescott Street was laid out in 1845 on what had previously been farmland. This house was built in 1850 by Edwin Bassett, a maker of shoes for children and infants, a common product for local shoemakers in what was then a cottage industry. Bassett was the first in Reading to install a McKay stitching machine, significantly improving the process by which shoes were made. The machine had a revolutionizing effect in Reading, where the process of shoemaking would become increasingly industrialized.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is nominally three bays wide, although a fourth bay is created by side projection that the porch wraps around to meet; it is a product of the house's conversion to a duplex. There are entranceways in the two right bays and windows in those on the left. The porch has bracketed turned posts in the Victorian style, and a hip roof. The second floor has three windows, and the cornice below the gable is adorned with paired brackets. The gable is filled by a pair of sash windows, and there is an elaborate Stick style sunburst pattern of woodwork at the gable peak. Similar patterned woodwork is found on the small gable over the porch stairs, and in side-facing gables. The land on which this house was built was farmland owned by the locally prominent Prescott family, and was platted for subdivision in the 1880s. It was built sometime before 1889 by Francis E.

Earlier in 1981, Williams played in the longest game in professional baseball history, Rochester's 3-2 33-inning loss at Pawtucket. Williams went 0-for-13 in the game. Williams' 0-13 line is also a record in futility in any single professional baseball game.Bruce Hurst recalls epic 33-inning game The following spring, the Orioles traded Williams to the Reds along with another minor leaguer in exchange for catcher Joe Nolan. Williams got a slightly more extended shot with Cincinnati, playing in 18 games in September, 1983, but he managed just 2 hits in 36 at bats. The following spring, Williams was traded to the Detroit Tigers, and from there he bounced around the minors for several more years.

Previously known as the Highland School, the two-story brick- and-concrete Renaissance Revival building was designed by architect Horace G. Wadlin and built in 1896‚Äì97. The building served the town's public school needs until 1981. It is the town's most architecturally distinguished school building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, the year it was converted for use as the library. Description and history The Highland School building is set on the south side of Middlesex Avenue in the Reading Highlands area of Reading, west of the town's central business district. It is a two-story brick building with concrete and granite trim elements, a hip roof, and a high brick foundation separated from the body by a band of egg-and-dart molding. The body of the building is in pale yellow brick, while the foundation bricks are a darker reddish color. The front facade has projecting sections at each corner, and a center section that projects a shorter distance, but is fronted by a hip-roofed porte-cochere, supported by paired Ionic columns set brick piers connected by a wooden balustrade. The porte-cochere shelters the main entrance, which is recessed under a round-arch opening and accessed by stairs. The second level of the center projection has a bank of five round-arch windows. The Reading Highlands area was platted for residential development in the 1870s, and this school was built in 1896-97 to provide educational facilities to that area. The building was designed by the prominent local architect Horace G. Wadlin. The school was at first used for grades 4-8, and the junior high school occupied the first floor between 1915 and 1927. The school was closed in 1981, and in 1984 it was converted for use as the town's public library. An expansion and rehabilitation of the building is planned for 2015.

Its first documented owner was Emily Ruggles, a prominent local businesswoman and real estate developer. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history 11 Beach Street is located in a residential area east of downtown Reading, on the southwest side of the short street. Its immediate neighbor to the house, #17, is of substantially similar construction. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof. Its front facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the rightmost bay, sheltered by a shed-roof porch supported by turned columns. The attic half-story has two sash windows, and there is Stick style woodwork at the peak of the gable. Photos from a 1980 survey show fish-scale shingles and applied woodwork on the gable wall around and above the attic windows; these features have been removed or covered over. The house was built sometime in the 1880s as a speculative venture by Emily Ruggles, a prominent local businesswoman who operated a dry goods store and bought land on Beach Street for development in 1875. This house and the one adjacent were the first houses she had built, and appear to have been based on widely published architectural patterns. Her venture into real estate was unsuccessful. In the early 20th century, a resident of the house was Oscar Lowande, a prominent period circus performer.

Description and history It is located in northern Reading, on the east side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28, a major artery), between its junctions with Brentwood and Fairchild Drives. The lot it is set backs onto Pearl Street, which follows a more undulating north-south route than Main Street. In front of the house are a series of granite posts, which originally supported a rail fence. The house is 2-1/2 stories in height, of wood frame construction, and has a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The gable ends of the roof have no returns, and it has a broad cornice. The first-floor front windows are full- length, and are topped by shallow pediments. The full-width front porch is supported by paired columns. An ell extends to the left, joining the house to a garage. The house was built by John Nichols, a member of the locally prominent Nichols family, whose ancestral homestead originally stood nearby. It was built sometime before 1854, the year it first appears on local maps. Given the rural character of the area at the time of its construction, Nichols was probably a farmer.

Built sometime in the 1890s, it typifies local Victorian architecture of the period, in a neighborhood that was once built out with many similar homes. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history 129 High Street is located northwest of downtown Reading, on the northeast side of High Street between Dudley and Mount Vernon Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a front-facing gabled roof and mostly clapboarded exterior. Smaller gabled sections project to each side, that on the left side rectangular in shape, the one on the right above a two-story polygonal window bay. The dominant features of the front facade are a central second-floor balcony, and single-story semicircular projections with conical roofs at the outer bays. The right projection is a porch, with turned posts and balusters. The left bay is enclosed. Both the left bay and the skirt below the porch are finished in square tooth-cut shingling. The second-floor porch also has turned posts and balusters, the posts topped by round newels. In the attic gable is a projecting oriel window, its roof covered with shingles that extend across the decreasing width of the gable peak. At the very top of the peak, the shingles are again cut with square teeth. A period carriage house, with a distinctive pyramidal roof capped by a square cupola, now serves as a garage. The neighborhood where the house was built was, as late as the 1870s, part of a larger country estate. It was then subdivided and developed as a residential commuter suburb for middle and upper class workers who commuted to Boston for work.

Lobster, salmon, bass, herring and mackerel are landed at Quilty, formerly known for its curing industry. The area was officially classified as part of the west Clare Gaeltacht, an Irish-speaking community, until 1956. The Catholic Church, belonging to the parish Kilmurry Ibrickane, is the most prominent building, its round tower being visible for miles around the flat countryside. It was built in remembrance of the Leon XIII rescue.  Leon XIII  On 2 October 1907 a French three-masted full-rigged ship, the Leon XIII, was driven up on some of the very rocky reefs on Quilty Bay. All seemed lost for the ship and crew. The local fishermen, however, went out to sea in their currachs ‚Äì risking the equinoctial gales and Atlantic breakers in small open boats. They reached the wreck and somehow managed to save the crew and bring them safely ashore. The church porch contains a replica of the Leon XIII in a glass bottle, and the ship's bell stands in front of the altar.  Mutton Island  Across the bay from Quilty is Mutton Island. St Senan founded a church here in the early 6th century but by 1887 little remained except the Bed of St Senan, a shattered cross and a gable of his oratory. A signal tower built in the early 19th century was designed to give warning of invasion during the Napoleonic period but was also used by the coastguard to prevent smuggling. In the early 20th century Mutton Island was used as a prison; during certain tidal conditions, it is possible to walk along a path of limestone from Seafield (near Quilty) to Mutton Island.  Tromoroe Castle  Tromoroe Castle lies about 3 km from the village. It witnessed a number of battles in the 16th century, the most notable when Teigh Caech McMahon with the help of the Earl of Desmond stormed the castle on 17 February 1599. The next attack was by O'Flaherty from Connacht on 1 May 1642, when Peter Ward, his wife and heir were slain.  Sport  In the 1970s Quilty GAA club amalgamated with Kilmurry Ibrickane GAA club. The club kept the name Kilmurry- Ibrickane GAA but started playing at the former club grounds in the village.

It was built c. 1874 and probably moved to its present location not long afterward, during a building boom in that part of the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history Mineral Street is located in a residential area west of downtown Reading, running roughly east‚Äìwest between High and Prospect Streets. It is named for a failed business venture to develop a nearby spring commercially. Number 16 is located near its eastern end, on the south side between High and Vine Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof providing a full second story. The steep part of the roof is pierced by gable dormers with octagonal hood moldings. It is three bays wide, with its front entry in the leftmost bay. The front entry porch is Italianate in style, with square chamfered columns. A polygonal bay projects from one of the bays on the right side of the main block. The house is enlarged by extensions to the rear. The house was built in the early 1870s, when this part of Reading was undergoing a housing boom. The Boston and Maine Railroad, which Mineral Street crosses west of this house, was built through the area in 1870, and set off a building boom of housing for workers who commuted to Boston by rail. It may have been built by Timothy Temple, a builder active in the area at the time.

Initial conceptions of conflict early warning materialized in the 1970s and 1980s but the field really emerged on the international policy agenda after the end of the Cold War. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches have been developed for conflict forecasting and conflict monitoring. Qualitative methodologies typically draw on local area experts with extensive knowledge on one country or region. This is the approach taken by the International Crisis Group, for example. In contrast, quantitative methodologies quantify conflict trends and use mathematical techniques to forecast future trends or \\"events of interest\\" (EOIs) such as the onset of conflicts. For example, the Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS) project at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) takes this approach. Some approaches to conflict early warning combine both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, such as Swisspeace's formerly operational project called FAST. Origins The unanticipated events of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and that of the Falklands War in 1982 provoked a series of debates over the lack of early warning. The incident over the Falklands had taken the United Nations completely by surprise and it is said \\"no map of the islands was available in the Secretariat when the invasion began\\". The initial drivers, however, were humanitarian agencies \\"driven by the need for accurate and timely predictions of refugee flows to enable effective contingency planning\\". After the end of the Cold War, political scientists at leading academic institutions began modifying old Cold War models of conflict to understand the onset of new wars. The horrors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide also spurred increased interest in operational conflict early warning systems. The FAST project of Swisspeace and the Forum on Early Warning and Early Response (FEWER) were responses to the genocide.

Ronald Chase Returns to the Scene. San Francisco Chronicle Photography In the early 1980s Chase began experimenting with photography. He manipulated photographs using large format Xerox copiers. His work with figures and abstract imagery was given a show at the George Eastman House in 1984. His photographic work then entered the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the George Eastman House, and the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, New York among others. Film In 1963, Chase began making short experimental films with Fragments, written by Mary Lee Settle and filmed in the Hudson Valley. In 1964, he began experimenting with using film projections in theater and dance performances. These experiments produced The Covenant, a dance film made with Elizabeth Harris and the composer Pauline Oliveros, followed by dramatic shorts including Chameleon and Clown, which was featured at the 1969 Ann Arbor Film Festival, and Parade, a short documentary of the first Gay & Lesbian Pride Parade in San Francisco. Chase produced and directed two features in the 1970s.

Though he was born in New Jersey, and lived in Mexico and Texas, Nelson is best known for establishing a homestead-turned-zoo on the shore of Florida's Loxahatchee River. Filled with exotic and wild animals, his zoo was a popular tourist spot in the 1940s and 1950s, visited by local and national celebrities. Because of this, he became known locally as \\"Tarzan of the Loxahatchee\\". The zoo was eventually shut down by state health inspectors in 1960. After his zoo was closed, Nelson became a hermit and suffered from undiagnosed health problems. In 1968, he was found dead from a gunshot wound in his cabin by a friend. His death was ruled a suicide. Nelson's campsite is now known as the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District in Jonathan Dickinson State Park, Hobe Sound, Florida. Early life the Historical Society of Palm Beach County, Vincent \\"Trapper Nelson\\" Natulkiewicz, claims \\"Vincent Natulkiewicz was born in Trenton, New Jersey about 1908.\\" Vincent Natulkiewicz was born to Casimer and Christine Natulkiewicz, in Trenton New Jersey in 1908, per grand-niece, Cynthia Celmer Tomassetti. As a boy, to earn money he began trapping animals such as muskrats in the marshes of New Jersey. His parents did not speak English, so Nelson would often assist them in translating to make sure they were not taken advantage of. However, when his mother died and his father remarried, Nelson ran away from home, heading west. Hopping freight trains, Nelson first ended up in Colorado, then eventually in Mexico. While there, he was arrested by the Federales under suspicion of gunrunning. He spent time in a Mexican jail and was later released. Nelson later claimed his release was because he \\"wrecked their food budget.\\" After his release Nelson headed back east with 10 cents to his name. He made money for food by gambling with other road bums until he made it to South Florida, where he, his step brother Charles Nelson and friend John Dykas set up camp. Settlement on the Loxahatchee Nelson and his partners settled on the beach by the Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the late 1920s. Bessie DuBois, wife of John DuBois, recalled seeing him for the first time in 1927 or 1928. The DuBoises owned a restaurant that Nelson would frequent, and Bessie made note of his eccentric eating habits: \\"He would order a pie‚Äînot a piece of pie, mind you, but a pie‚Äîand he'd eat the whole thing right in front of me.\\" He ate ice cream by the half- gallon, and there were stories that he once ate 18 eggs for breakfast. Things did not stay peaceful for long. On December 17, 1931, Charles Nelson shot partner John Dykas in the back, killing him. Trapper Nelson, angered by his step-brother's actions, testified against him at the trial for Dykas' murder. Charles was given a 20-year sentence at Raiford Prison. Disillusioned with civilization, Nelson withdrew from the beach, settling deep in the woods on the Loxahatchee River that same December. Using what little money he had and money borrowed from his sister, he bought 800 acres. Physically imposing at 6' 4\\" and 240 pounds, he lived by trapping, hunting, and fishing in what was then wild country. He made money by selling the furs of the animals he trapped, and ate the meat, starting rumors that he ate everything from opossums to stray house cats. He acquired extensive land holdings, bidding on tax auctions during the Great Depression. He would on occasion bid against Judge C. E. Chillingworth, the judge who had handed down his step-brother's sentence, and the two eventually became friends. When Chillingworth was murdered in the 1950s, Charles Nelson was briefly considered a suspect. Trapping could only bring Nelson income seasonally, and as south Florida became a popular tourist destination, he came up with a new way to earn money. He eventually developed a zoo on his property in the 1930s, calling it \\"Trapper Nelson's Zoo and Jungle Gardens\\". His camp and zoo became popular tourist attractions. Tours along the river from West Palm Beach would stop there for lunch and stretch breaks, and Nelson shared the profits with the boat captains. Locally prominent people and celebrities alike visited, including boxing champion Gene Tunney and actor Gary Cooper, to see his animals, watch Nelson wrestle alligators, and buy souvenirs. With his new fame came notoriety. He was known locally as the \\"Tarzan of the Loxahatchee\\", and cared for the locals' exotic pets. He would trap troublesome wild animals, and provided others for parties and events. Rumors were started about his handsomeness, his eating habits (Bessie DuBois denied he ate raw possum), and his romantic exploits. It was told that he courted heiresses and countesses from wealthy Palm Beach, and that one conquest was a direct descendant of President James Monroe. Nelson finally married in 1940 in an attempt to avoid the draft for World War II. His plan failed and he was drafted anyway. He joined the Military Police in Texas, but while training, he tore a muscle in his leg and was transferred to Camp Murphy, which was very close to his land. Decline Upon his return to the Loxahatchee, Nelson discovered that his wife had a new lover. He divorced his wife, and after that Nelson bought cars for the women he wooed, paying for them in installments to ensure they would stay for at least a while. Focusing again on his zoo, he found that property values were skyrocketing. Nelson got a subscription to the Wall Street Journal and added more and more land to his sprawling camp. Shortly after he began his forays into real estate, a health inspector declared his zoo unhygienic and demanded he install lavatories. Nelson did, but the Health Department found them \\"unsatisfactory\\", and in 1960 he was forced to close his zoo. With no income, the taxes on the land became too much for him, and he ended up borrowing $100,000 ($ in today's dollars) to pay them. Nelson already had a deep-seated mistrust of the government, and the closing of his zoo was, to him, enough to confirm his paranoia. He became more and more closed off. He began to dam the river leading to his camp to keep boats away, and installed fences and padlocks to discourage land travelers. He put up signs around his land reading \\"Danger: Land Mines\\". As added discouragement, he kept a 12-gauge shotgun with him at all times. Nelson began to develop severe stomach pains, but refused to see a doctor. He distrusted them because his brother-in-law, Philp Celmer I had died during pacemaker surgery. It was speculated among friends that the pains were from cancer, but they could have been an acid condition. Nelson was ill, and had to urinate using a catheter. His grand niece, Cynthia Celmer Tomassetti, who saw him weeks before his death, remembers him in poor health. says Celmer Tomassetti, \\"He told me he had let all of the zoo animals go because was afraid he would become too ill to care for them, and they might starve to death.\\" By the 1960s Nelson had become so reclusive that he would not let even trusted friends visit him without first sending a postcard to ask his permission. He ventured into town once a week to check his mail at the post office, and would sometimes buy steaks, but for the most part he remained holed up in his cabin. Years later, his nephew recalled his uncle's change in personality: \\"During the last 10 years, his eyes seemed to lose their sparkle. He became a lonely man, and a rather sick one.\\" Death In July 1968, Nelson failed to appear for a planned meeting with an old friend. John DuBois, at whose house the meeting was supposed to take place, became worried and drove to Nelson's camp. When he surveyed the campsite, everything appeared to be in order, until he got to Nelson's chickee. Nelson was found dead in his cabin from a shotgun blast to his stomach on July 30, 1968. The Coroner's Office ruled it a suicide, and the Martin County Sheriff's Office deemed it a \\"pretty clear-cut case\\". However, many Florida locals had their doubts. \\"If it were a suicide, why did[n't] he do a head shot instead of a chest shot?\\" asked Bessie DuBois. The theory was that he stuck the shotgun in the ground, leaned over and pulled the trigger, even though it would have taken considerable effort and flexibility on Nelson's part. It was undeniable that Nelson had enemies. Floridian trappers envied his skill and viewed him as an outsider because he was from New Jersey. The State wanted to develop his land into condominiums and golf courses. Shortly before his death, a man who repaired one of Nelson's jeeps found out he was sick and had not seen a doctor in six months. The man took him to a doctor who prescribed him painkillers. A neighbor, and the last man to see Nelson alive, speculated: \\"I guess it would be possible for someone to sneak up on him. Ordinarily it would be impossible... but if he were doped up, well that would be different.\\" Some friends considered suicide a possibility, however. His stomach pains may have taken a substantial part in a decision to end his life. An executor of Nelson's will said he had told his sister that he would \\"rather die than be an invalid.\\" Nelson's family never considered foul play, said grand-niece, Cynthia Celmer Tomassetti, \\"Vince had discussed his failing health with my father, brother and mother. He was adamant that he would not live in that manner. It was my father's opinion that he avoided aiming as his head to spare his considerably handsome face.\\" Legacy A few months after Nelson's death, the state traded land for Nelson's estate, which became part of Jonathan Dickinson State Park. The site is now known as the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District. After the land was converted to a park, but still unopen to the public, the camp was often vandalized. One of Nelson's tool sheds was burned down; the arsonist attempted to burn other buildings but was unsuccessful. In April 1984, park rangers discovered Nelson's \\"treasure\\": a hiding place in his chimney held 5,005 coins, totaling $1,829.46. The coins ranged in date from the 1890s to the 1960s. A thorough search of the camp was conducted before revealing the find to the public, but nothing more was found. The camp still stands today, with his cabin, a guest cabin, a chickee shelter, docks, a boathouse, and assorted cages from his zoo. There are also fruit trees that he planted, including surinam cherry, Java plum and wild almond.

Flanigan, Assistant to the President, and Clay T. Whitehead, Staff Assistant,\\" Office of the White House Press Secretary, January 23, 1970. The OTP was also responsible for Nixon Administration policy towards the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Cable OTP's two major initiatives concerning cable included the 1971 Cable Copyright Compromise and the 1974 Cabinet Committee on Cable Communications Cable: Report to the President, or \\"The Whitehead Report.\\" OTP took a strong interest in supporting cable's development in part because Whitehead saw that \\"cable promises a revolutionary diversity and a fundamentally new system of communication.\\" In 1971 and 1972, cable operators were blocked by copyright owners and broadcasters who demanded fees for distributing their programs. OTP facilitated a Cable Copyright Compromise that pacified cable opponents enough to permit some industry growth. Two years later, a Cabinet Committee on Cable chaired by Whitehead released a report denouncing industry regulation. Until the Committee's report, cable had been seen as an extension of broadcast television, and subject to its regulations. But the 1974 Cabinet Committee on Cable Communications Cable: Report to the President advocated applying a different regulatory model to cable. It argued in part that cable did not use the publicly owned airwaves and promised a multitude of channels instead of the limited number necessitated by spectrum scarcity, which meant that cable and the television networks were not analogous businesses. Accordingly, the report reasoned, cable should be afforded the same freedom of expression as the print media.Irwin, Don (1974-01-17). 'Plan for Developing Cable TV Offered,' Los Angeles Times AT&T; Consistent with OTP's goal to increase competition and technological innovation within telecommunications industries, OTP worked to loosen AT&T;'s hold on U.S. telephone service.By December 1973, AT&T; had a near monopoly on local phone service relative to independent service providers, a monopoly on all voice traffic international communication, a monopoly of the telephone equipment market, and its Long Lines division held a monopoly on long distance inter-state transmission of telephone message traffic. See, e.g., Office of Telecommunications Policy, The Telephone Industry and Antitrust: A Report on Anticompetitive Practices of the Bell System, Preface at 1-3 (Dec. 1973). Further, it enjoyed an 80-90% share of long distance specialized business services such as data transmission and television signals, as well as the customer terminal equipment market. Ibid. The Nixon Administration launched its first volley against AT&T; in January 1970 when it announced its \\"Open Skies\\" policy that allowed all qualifying companies to launch commercial satellites. This defeated AT&T;'s expectations that the White House would give monopoly control to Comsat, of which AT&T; owned 29 percent, the largest share held by any single company.See, e.g., In re: Establishment of Domestic Communications-Satellite Facilities by Non- Governmental Entities, Docket No. 16495, 38 F.C.C.2d 665 at *12 (Dec. 22, 1972) (requiring AT&T; to divest its 29% ownership in Comsat if it wants to compete in offering domestic satellite services because \\"the competitive roles which Comsat and AT&T; are assuming in the domestic communications field dictate the need for maximum independence from each other and an arms-length relationship.\\") OTP further weakened AT&T;'s monopoly by supporting a Department of Justice antitrust investigation of, and then litigation against, AT&T.;Coll, Steve. The Deal of the Century: The Breakup of AT&T; 60-61 (1986). OTP's chief economist, Bruce M. Owen, favored breaking up AT&T; and persuaded Whitehead that the best way to split the company was the way in which it was finally done, by separating long distance from local service ‚Äì known as horizontal divestiture.See, e.g., Office of Telecommunications Policy, (Dec. 1973). The Telephone Industry and Antitrust: A Report on Anticompetitive Practices of the Bell System, Chapter IX Summary and Conclusions at 5 (arguing that Bell's \\"divestiture of Long Lines is almost certainly required\\" to increase competition in the \\"specialized carrier, miscellaneous common carrier, and domestic satellite markets.\\"). OTP supported the Department of Justice through testimony before a Senate Antitrust and Monopoly subcommittee hearing concerning a bill that would break up big businesses in industries including communications.Burnham, David (1974-07-31) 'AT&T; Defends Size and Power,' The New York Times, p. 41 (Senate subcommittee \\"hearings were held several days after the Justice Department acknowledged that its Antitrust Division for the last year has been investigating the company for possible antitrust violations . . . .\\") Whitehead's testimony explained that historically, competition was the preferred regulatory tool in the U.S., and that it applied equally in telecommunications as in any other industry. Monopoly in the telephone business, he explained, was not a necessary structure in the nation's telecommunications industry and, in fact, the existing regulatory scheme had become \\"a barrier to competition and innovation required for the future direction of communications.\\" Whitehead stated that, moreover, no special public policy considerations such as national defense necessitated the AT&T; monopoly.Clay T. Whitehead Testimony on S. 1167 before Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly, July 9, 1974 at 8 (\\"[U]nless the would-be monopolist or the public can demonstrate special public policy considerations that justify monopoly, it should not be permitted. . . . At present there does not appear to be any service other than the local public telephone service where monopoly rather than competition would best serve the public interest.\\"). It was unbecoming for \\"AT&T; to use its legal, political and economic power to seek to extend its monopoly\\" where monopoly was not warranted, and \\"the Government cannot let such an effort go unnoticed or unchecked.\\" He also said that \\"the anti-trust laws should be enforced to ensure that regulatory mechanisms cannot become a haven for escape from competition.\\" Some weeks later, the Department of Justice filed the antitrust caseMathews, Linda (1974-11-21) 'Justice Dept. Sues to Break Up AT&T;,' Los Angeles Times, at OC1. As Whitehead hoped, one remedy sought was horizontal divestiture. (\\"In addition, the department asked that AT&T; be forced to sell stock and assets to separate its long lines department, which handles 90% of the nation's interstate phone calls, from the local Bell Telephone companies.\\"). that ultimately led to the break-up of AT&T; along the lines that Bruce M. Owen had suggested, with AT&T; retaining its long distance services, Western Electric and Bell Laboratories, and giving up its local telephone companies.A.P., 'Justice Dept., AT&T; Accept Judge's Antitrust Conditions,' Los Angeles Times, Aug. 19, 1982, at A2.

The town administers five villages: Bistri»õa NouƒÉ, Criva de Jos, Criva de Sus, Eno»ôe»ôti and Piatra. The town is an important railway station and road intersection. History The oldest relics are from the Neolithic, when there was a small settlement. In Antiquity, the local Dacic population built a fortress, Acidava. The Romans conquered the area. The Romans built a road and rebuilt the fortress Acidava. The ruins of the fortress can be seen even today. The area was still inhabited after the retreat of the Roman legios. From the Middle Ages come the first written documents about the villages that now compose the town. *Bistri»õa NouƒÉ is first attested in 1835. The name comes from the Bistri»õa Monastery. The land where is the village today was the property of the monastery. The village was also called Fle»ôtenoagele or Fle»ôcinogele. *Criva, also known as Criva de Jos, was attested on May 26, 1630, as a property of a local boyar, jupan Gorgan biv vel spƒÉtar. Part of the village is known as Criva de Sus since 1940. This is the village that hosts the ruins of the Dacic fortress, Acidava. *Enose»ôti, also known as Ienu»ôe»ôti, Ieno»ôe»ôti, was officially formed on March 31, 1864, as an independent commune The first notices about the village comes from 1814. This is the village that hosts the Roman fortress Acidava. *Piatra is noticed for the first time on April 14, 1529, as the place where an important boyar, marele ban P√¢rvu Craioves-cu died. On May 15, 1592, »òtefan Surdu voievod, rooler over Valahia at that time, confirmes that Piatra and several villages around it, are the property of jup√¢ni»õa Neacsa si fiului ei Mihail (local boyars). Part of the village appear through history as Piatra de Jos and Piatra de Sus. *There are also some village names that are sometimes mentioned, but are no longer used today, like Flestenoaga (1941), JegƒÉlia (17th century) and Matei Basarab (an official name of Eno»ôe»ôti). In 1878, the railroad Pite»ôti - V√Ærciorova was operational and the railway station Piatra Olt (known at that time as Piatra) was built. This was the beginning of the modern history of the town, as a railway town. Later, other railways were built, along the Olt river. Piatra Olt was officially declared a town in 1989. Location The town is situated in the Central-Eastern part of the Romanian Plain, at the eastern border of Oltenia historical provence and in the western part of the Olt County.maps.google.com/ The nearby towns are in East: Slatina (11 km), Pite»ôti (93 km); to West: Bal»ô (19 km), Craiova (45 km); to North: DrƒÉgƒÉ»ôani (31 km), R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea (86 km) and to South Caracal (33 km)) and Corabia (74 km)). Note that these are intermediate values between road and railway distances. General The main village, Piatra, is placed near the train station and expands to South-East. It is divided into two parts: the eastern part (named Piatra Sat by the locals) and the western part, near the station, called GarƒÉ (in English, station). Eno»ôe»ôti is placed East from Piatra, on the 64 national road and is the road access way to Piatra. Criva is placed South-East from Piatra and has a small railway station. Bistri»õa NouƒÉ is at North from Piatra, at 2 km by foot and more than 7 km by road. Geography The town is at the North-Eastern end of the Romana»õi Plain. The average altitude is 100 to 120 meters. Despite the relatively high altitude and a big number of valleys and smooth hills, the aria is very good for agriculture. The town is placed near the Olt River, on a terrace that protects it from floods. There are several dams on the river. There are some other small rivers, that sometimes dry up in summer, like Vaslui and Olti»ôor. They are all tributaries of the Olt and are formed near Piatra Olt. Climate Like all the southern part of Romania, Piatra Olt has a temperate climate. Usually, summers are hot and with little precipitations, while winters have moderate temperatures, with occasional wind intensifications. Sometimes, snow can cause several blockades on the roads and railways. Demographics At the 2002 census, 90.6% of inhabitants were Romanians and 9.4% Roma. 97.7% were Romanian Orthodox and 1.6% Seventh-day Adventist. \\"Piatra-Olt\\" , at the Erd√©lyi Magyar Adatbank's RecensƒÉm√¢nt 2002 ; retrieved September 22, 2011 There are ethnic conflicts between the Romanian and Gipsy groups. In 2007, it was required forced intervention to calm down the population and avoid vioent conflicts. Transportation The main way to get to Piatra Olt is by train.trainz.uv.ro/maps/cfr/cfr_flash.html There are 4 railways that lead to Piatra Olt: *201 railway connects Piatra Olt with Sibiu and R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea (note that the train station is named R√Æmnicu V√Ælcea because the train stations are written with √Æ and not with √¢). *901 railway (eastern part) connects Piatra Olt with the towns Slatina, Pite»ôti and Bucharest. *901 railway (western part) continues the eastern sector from Piatra Olt to Craiova. Several trains pass from Bucharest to Craiova, while others have the last station at Piatra Olt. *910 railway connects Piatra Olt with Caracal and Corabia. The sector between Caracal and Corabia is used by a private railway company. The town is also an important road intersection. The intersection is in fact in the nearby commune, GƒÉneasa. The access way to Piatra Olt is the county road DJ 677. There are 5 km from Piatra Olt to GƒÉneasa on the road and only 2 km on a sharp line. All national roads are asphalted, while the county road is a concrete road, like other smaller roads in the town. The roads follow nearly the same path like the railways: *The national road DN 64 connects to South GƒÉneasa with Caracal and Corabia. To North, it continues to R√¢nicu V√¢lcea. *The national road DN 65, also known as E 574 (European road) connects GƒÉneasa to East with Pite»ôti and to West to Craiova. Economy The main occupation is related to the railway maintenance and transportation. There are 66 trains traveling every day through the station. However, Agriculture is well represented (large-scale agriculture with grain and corn fields, fishing and pomiculture) There are big companies that work in the agricole sector. The Industry is based on textiles, metallic and concrete products, alimentar industry and a wood mill.

Built c. 1854-1875, it is a rare surviving remnant of a residential subdivision once dubbed \\"Mudville\\" for the condition of its unpaved roads. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The house at 26 Center Avenue is located in a residential area southwest of downtown Reading, on the south side of Center Street near its junction with Maple Avenue. It is 1-1/2 stories in height, of wood frame construction, and resting on a brick foundation set on an artificially raised mound. This latter feature was one commonly used during Reading's real estate development during the Greek Revival period. Its front facade is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the rightmost bay, framed by sidelight windows, pilasters, and a corniced entablature. Survey photos of the building in 1980 show jigsawn vergeboard on the front gable and side eaves, a Gothic feature, and bracketed and corniced surrounds on the front windows; these features have either been removed or covered over. Based on stylistic analysis, the house was built sometime between about 1854 and 1875 as worker housing. It was part of a residential subdivision created by developer Amos Cummings in 1854. Cummings loaned workers money with which they could build houses, and then collected rent or other payments to recoup his investment. The scheme failed in the Panic of 1857, leaving a network of unpaved roads that became muddy when rains flooded the area. This gave rise to the name \\"Mudville\\", which was applied to the area for many years. Residents were eventually able to improve the neighborhood, and it is no longer known by that name.

Moore was the aggressor throughout and sportswriters at ringside differed with the official decision and gave Moore the slight edge in the going. Heavier and stronger than his opponent, Moore had the fight all his own way at first and piled up points as he kept boring in on Williams. Williams got going in the 5th and offset Moore's rushes by sharper and faster punching. In the 6th Moore dealt Williams hard blows to the body and head. The 7th and 8th rounds went to Williams after referee Eddie Leonard called low punches on Moore.\\" -Associated Press The immediate rematch between Williams (136-20-10) and Archie Moore (75-11-5) saw Moore batter Williams into an 11th-round TKO.

Albright played for the Philadelphia Phillies in the season. He batted and threw right-handed. In 41 games, Albright had 23 hits in 99 at- bats, he also had two home runs and eight errors at shortstop. Biography Albright was born in St. Petersburg, Florida. He went to high school in San Diego, where he also played on a national champion American Legion team. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, and he played shortstop on the baseball team. While at Cal, Albright was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Professional baseball scouts took an interest in Albright as soon as 1941, his sophomore year at Cal. A 1943 United Press article noted Albright's reputation as the best shortstop to ever come out of the university. Albright studied commerce at Cal and he had a batting average of around .350 in four seasons. In June 1943, Albright was signed by the Boston Red Sox and assigned to one of their minor league teams, the Louisville Colonels. The Boston organization signed him even though he was a naval reservist and was expected to be called into active duty on August 2. The organization praised Albright's work ethic and his alertness on the field. The Louisville manager, Bill Burwell, said that Albright compared favorably to any shortstop he had seen, including Johnny Pesky and Pee Wee Reese, but Albright soon entered active military duty, serving on the USS Bebas through 1946. Albright returned to the Colonels after his military discharge, and his contract was purchased by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1947. He appeared with the major league team for about two months before breaking his leg. After his injury, Albright did not return to the major leagues, and he was out of professional baseball by 1951. He died in 1991 in San Diego, California.

Norfolk was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2007. Professional career Born William Ward in Belmont, Virginia, Norfolk moved with his family to Panama as a youngster. He made his professional boxing debut on 29 November 1910 at the Albaugh Theater in Baltimore, Maryland, losing a six-rounder to Kid Jasper on points. He fought in Baltimore through 1913, then began campaigning in Panama in 1914. He took his name from having been born on Norfolk Street back in Belmont.  Panamanian heavyweight title  Norfolk defeated Abraham Hollandersky decisively in January 1914 in Colon, Panama. Hollandersky had briefly held the Panamanian Heavyweight title from May 1913. Norfolk first officially fought for the Heavyweight Title on 16 May 1915, taking on Jeff Clark at the Vista Allegre Bull Ring in Panama City. Clark (who weighed 173) gave Kid Norfolk (weighing in at 174) a beating, and won the 20-rounder on points. Their weights properly classed them as light heavies. In a rematch on 12 November 1916, Kid Nortolk took Clark's title away from him on points in 20 rounds. The Kid defended the title against one time world heavyweight contender Arthur Pelkey, a Canadian who had held the Dominion's heavyweight title and the White Heavyweight Championship during the latter days of Jack Johnson reign. The Kid K.O.-ed Pelkey in the 13th round.\\"Pelkey is Knocked Out\\", Daily Arkansas Gazette, Little Rock, Arkansas, pg. 6, 12 February 1917 Norfolk fought Sam Langford for the World Colored Heavyweight Championship on 17 December 1917 at Stockyards Stadium in Denver, Colorado, and was K.O.-ed in the second round of the scheduled 20-round bout.\\"Sam Langford in Limelight\\", Washington Times, Washington D.C., pg. 19, 21 December 1917 On 30 May 1921, The Kid fought Lee Anderson for the colored light heavyweight title in a scheduled 10-round bout in Phoenix, Arizona. Anderson won on a technical knock out when Norfolk returned to his corner in the ninth round, being unable to continue to fight. (They would meet another three times in non-title bouts between 1922 and 1924, and The Kid prevailed each time.) Of their first meeting in Phoenix for the \\"Colored World Championship\\", there was surprisingly little coverage, though the Arizona Republic wrote \\"two thousand fans watched the fights and every one of the 2000 is will to admit it was the best fight ever staged in the state\\". Norfolk was unable to return to battle at the opening of the ninth round, claiming blindness, as his \\"left eye was completely closed.\\"\\"Anderson is Now Colored Heavyweight Champion of World\\", Arizona Republic, pg.8, Phoenix Arizona, 31 May 1921  Norfolk vs. Greb  His next fight was against future world middleweight champ Harry Greb on 29 August 1921 in a 10-rounder at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Kid, who at 178¬æ lbs. outweighed Greb by 17 1/2 lbs., won four of the first five rounds and knocked Greb down in the third. Greb, however, won all of the last five rounds. Greb won a newspaper decision, when two of the three newspaper covering the fight and the Associated Press gave him the win. During the fight, The Kid apparently landed a punch that caused a detachment of the retina in Greb's eye that later led to Greb going blind in that eye.  World colored light heavyweight champion  When Norfolk fought The Jamaica Kid on 20 December 1921 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, he had claimed the world colored light heavyweight title. He beat the Jamaica Kid on points in an eight-round bout. In Atlanta on 30 January 1922, Norfolk faced Tiger Flowers, the boxer who would dethrone Greb and become the first African American world middleweight champ in 1926, K.O.-ing him in third round of a 10-rounder. He met reigning colored heavyweight champ Harry Wills on 2 March 1922 in Madison Square Garden in New York City for a 15-round non-title bout, losing to the great champion via a K.O. in the second round. Wills outweighed him by 25¬æ lbs. He had a draw in a fight with Tiger Flowers on the Fourth of July 1922 in Memphis, Tennessee, and they fought again on 8 May 1923, in Springfield, Ohio for the colored Light Heavyweight Title. The Kid prevailed by K.O.-ing Tiger at 2:50 in the first round of their scheduled 12-round bout, in possibly his greatest and most historic victory. Though technically a world championship, there was surprisingly little coverage of the fight, with the Cincinnati Enquirer writing only one line, \\"Kid Norfolk stopped Tiger Flowers in one round the other night in Springfield, Ohio.\\" Norfolk received far more coverage of non-championship bouts he had against well known white opponents.\\"All Fit, Boxers Ready for Bell,\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 11, 10 May 1923  Norfolk vs. Greb II  Norfolk fought Greb one more time on 19 April 1924 in a scheduled 10-rounder in Boston. The Kid won when Greb was disqualified for fighting in the sixth round. The fight was wild and wooly, The Kid besting Greb through the first five rounds. In the second round, Greb had lowered his head and The Kid through the ropes and into the press section, which should have disqualified him, according to the Boston Globe. The last two rounds was a brutal, dirty fight, in which Norfolk intentionally punched Greb in the groin several times. When Greb retaliated, he was disqualified which angered the crowd and forced the referee to quit the ring. The result of the fight was a six-month suspension for both fighters. The boxing commission suspended both Greb and Norfolk six months for fighting after the bell.  Later career  On 25 May 1925 at the Stadium Rink in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Norfolk fought Canadian light heavyweight champ Jack Reddick in a 12-rounder, winning a decision on points. Though the fight was between two men who had held World Championships, newspaper coverage was minimal.\\"Thunderbolt to Try for Knockout Against White Heavyweight\\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, pg. 20, 17 June 1925 Norfolk retired in 1926 with an official record of 70 wins (with 38 K.O.s against 22 losses (being K.O.-ed seven times) and six draws along with 30 wins and two losses via newspaper decisions. Despite being a top contender, he never challenged for a world title, the color bar having been drawn in the light heavy and heavyweight divisions in his era. Norfolk died in 1968.

The gable is decorated with scalloped shingles and has a small recessed window above a projecting oriel window. The front porch has bracketed turned columns and delicate balusters, and a spindled valance. The house was built in the 1890s, as part of a building boom in which Reading was transformed into a railroad suburb of Boston.

Although a civilian official, he was also known for his military strategies, and he is best known for being in charge of the campaign against the warlord Wu Yuanji during Emperor Xianzong's reign.  Background  Pei Du was born in 765, during the reign of Emperor Daizong. His family was from Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi)Old Book of Tang, vol. 170. and traced its ancestry to a line of officials of Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Former Yan, Later Qin, and Northern Wei, although Pei Du's direct ancestors was not listed with governmental offices for several generations until his grandfather Pei Youlin (), who served as a county magistrate, and his father Pei Xu () served as a county secretary general.New Book of Tang, vol. 71. In 789, during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Pei Du passed the imperial examinations and the special examination for grand speech. He later further passed special examinations for those who could properly criticize the government. He was thereafter made the sheriff of Heyin County (Ê≤≥Èô∞, in modern Luoyang, Henan), and thereafter was made an imperial censor with the title Jiancha Yushi (). At one point, he submitted a secret petition that criticized those who were powerful due to their associations with Emperor Dezong, and thus was sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as an administrator at the Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region) government. He later became an imperial archiver (Ëµ∑Â±ÖËàç‰∫∫, Qiju Sheren).  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  In 811, during the reign of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong, Pei Du was made Sifeng Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), and put in charge of drafting edicts. He was soon promoted to be Sifeng Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs. In 812, after Tian Xing the military governor (Jiedushi) of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) submitted his circuit to imperial orders (previously, under Tian Xing's predecessor Tian Ji'an and prior military governors, Weibo had been governed in a de facto independent manner from the imperial government), Emperor Xianzong sent Pei to Weibo to comfort Tian Xing and the soldiers and to give a large cash reward to the Weibo soldiers. It was said that while at Weibo, Pei often spoke of the ways of faithfulness to Tian Xing, and that Tian Xing was attentive to Pei's encouragement.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. After Pei returned from the mission to Weibo, he was made Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). In 814, Pei was made deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). While serving in that office, there was an occasion in spring 815 when he interceded on behalf of the exiled official Liu Yuxi, who was set to be made the prefect of Bo Prefecture (Êí≠Â∑û, in modern Zunyi, Guizhou), pointing out that, as Liu Yuxi's friend Liu Zongyuan, who was also to be exiled and who had offered to go to Bo Prefecture in Liu Yuxi's stead, that Bo Prefecture was so remote that Liu Yuxi could not possibly take his mother with him, and further pointing out that Emperor Xianzong himself also still had to support his mother (Empress Dowager Wang). Emperor Xianzong thus made Liu Yuxi the prefect of the somewhat less remote Lian Prefecture (ÈÄ£Â∑û, in modern Qingyuan, Guangdong). By that point, Emperor Xianzong was deeply involved in a campaign against the warlord Wu Yuanji, who controlled Zhangyi Circuit (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). He sent Pei to the front to observe the campaign. Upon return, Pei reported his belief that Wu could be defeated, and further commended the general Li Guangyan for his bravery and righteousness. When Li Guangyan subsequently often had victories against Zhangyi troops, Emperor Xianzong came to believe Pei to have good judgment of character. In winter 815, assassins killed the chancellor Wu Yuanheng, who had been in charge of the campaign against Wu Yuanji; on the same morning, assassins tried to kill Pei as well, injuring Pei's head and causing Pei to fall into a ditch, but Pei's head was protected by a thick hat, allowing him to survive the attack. There was suggestions by some officials that Pei should be removed from office to appease Wu Yuanji's allies Wang Chengzong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) and Li Shidao the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). Emperor Xianzong rejected such talk, stating, \\"If I remove Pei Du from office, it will fulfill the desires of the treacherous, and the imperial government will no longer have any authority. My having Pei Du is sufficient to destroy the two bandits.\\" He made Pei Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, as well as de facto chancellor with the title Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Subsequently, when Pei pointed out that then- overall commander of the campaign against Wu Yuanji, Yan Shou (), was incompetent, Emperor Xianzong made Han Hong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) overall commander instead. Pei continued to be a steadfast advocate for continuing the campaign against Wu Yuanji. In summer 816, after the imperial general Gao Xiayu () suffered a major defeat against Zhangyi troops, there were renewed talks among officials that the campaign should end. Emperor Xianzong was said to continue to follow Pei's advice, and Emperor Xianzong spoke sternly against those who suggested ending the campaign. In winter 816, after the official Wang E () died and offered much of his wealth to the imperial government, two servants of Wang's made a report that Wang Ji () had secretly modified Wang's will and hid some of the assets. Emperor Xianzong was set to send eunuchs to investigate this report, but Pei pointed out that Wang E had already offered a large amount of wealth, and investigations would cause all other officials to worry about what would happen after they died. Emperor Xianzong agreed, ended the investigation, and had Wang's servants executed. As of fall 817, the campaign against Zhangyi was still ongoing without ultimate success. Pei's colleague Li Fengji advocated ending the campaign on account of army fatigue and treasury depletion. Pei, instead, offered to personally head to the front to oversee the campaign. Emperor Xianzong agreed, and, while Han remained titular overall commander, Pei was effectively put in charge and given a staff of talented officials and military officers, and he was also made the military governor of Zhangyi in anticipation of victory. When he wanted to take the general Zhang Maohe (ÂºµËåÇÂíå, a son of the general Zhang Xiaozhong) as a subordinate, Zhang was fearful and declined. Pei requested that Zhang be executed for refusing a direct order, but Emperor Xianzong spared Zhang and only exiled him. Also, as Pei was concerned that the imperial scholar Linghu Chu would cooperate with Li Fengji in opposing the campaign after he left Chang'an, he accused Linghu of using inappropriate language on Pei's commissioning edict and had Linghu demoted. Before Pei departed, he stated to Emperor Xianzong:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 240. Emperor Xianzong was greatly touched and shed tears. Once Pei reached the front, he saw that the generals were hesitant to make their own decisions because they were being monitored by eunuchs sent by Emperor Xianzong. At Pei's request, the eunuch monitors were recalled, and it was said that only thereafter did the generals dare to make their own decisions. While Pei was at the front, there was an occasion when a surprise attack by the Zhangyi general Dong Chongzhi () nearly killed him, but he was protected by Li Guangyan and Tian Bu (Tian Xing's son) and escaped the attack. Meanwhile, one of the imperial generals, Li Su the military governor of Tangsuideng Circuit (ÂîêÈö®ÈÑß, headquartered in modern Zhumadian) was planning a surprise attack on Zhangyi's capital Cai Prefecture (). When Li Su reported this plan to Pei, Pei approved of it. In winter 817, Li Su launched his attack and captured Cai Prefecture, taking Wu Yuanji captive and delivering him to Chang'an. When Pei subsequently arrived at Cai Prefecture, Li Su waited by the road to be ready to pay proper respect to Pei by military ceremony. Pei initially, in humility, wanted to avoid having Li Su bow to him, but Li Su pointed out that it was proper for them to demonstrate the proper etiquette for the imperial army before the surrendered soldiers and people of Cai Prefecture. Pei thus agreed. During the brief time that Pei was at Cai Prefecture, he used the Cai Prefecture soldiers as his own guards. When there was warning by his subordinates that there were still many rebellious individuals in the Cai Prefecture army, Pei laughed and responded: It was said that Pei's attitude touched the people of Cai Prefecture. Further, as during the rule of Wu Yuanji and his father Wu Shaoyang the people of Cai Prefecture were under strict regulations not to congregate, not to light candles at night, and not to hold feasts, Pei repealed all of these regulations. It was said that only then was some measure of normal life restored to the people of Cai Prefecture. Around the new year 818, Emperor Xianzong was then set to recall Pei. Pei made his officer Ma Zong () the acting military governor and departed Cai Prefecture. On the way, he encountered the imperial eunuch Liang Shouqian (), who had been bestowed two swords and given order to execute Wu Yuanji's former officers. Pei accompanied Liang back to Cai Prefecture and, not following Emperor Xianzong's orders in entirety, carried out punishment according to the faults of the officers rather than executing them. Only after doing so did he again depart Cai Prefecture. Emperor Xianzong thereafter created Pei the Duke of Jin and recalled him to Chang'an to again be chancellor. While Pei was still at Zhangyi, his subordinate Han Yu recommended the commoner Bo Qi () for a mission to persuade Wang Chengzong (whom Emperor Xianzong had believed to have been behind Wu Yuanheng's assassination and therefore declared a campaign against as well) to submit to imperial orders. Pei agreed and sent Bo. Wang, who was fearful after Wu Yuanji's destruction, sent his sons as hostages and surrendered two of his six prefectures to imperial control, offering to submit to imperial orders. Emperor Xianzong, after Tian Xing (whose name had been changed to Tian Hongzheng by this point) spoke in favor, agreed. In 818, when Emperor Xianzong commissioned the imperial guards to construct a number of palaces, the imperial guard generals Zhang Fengguo () and Li Wenyue (), believing that the realm was not yet peaceful, did not want the constructions to commence, and so reported this to the chancellors. Pei advised Emperor Xianzong to stop the constructions, but Emperor Xianzong became angry and did not agree with Pei. He moved Zhang and Li Wenyue to other positions and then commenced the constructions anyway. However, he continued to rely on Pei's advice on military matters, and Pei's colleague Li Yijian, believing himself to be less capable than Pei, offered to resign. Li Yijian was thus sent out of Chang'an to serve as the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Emperor Xianzong subsequently commissioned the officials Huangfu Bo and Cheng Yi as chancellors. As both Huangfu and Cheng had received imperial favor because of their gathering of money for the palace treasury. Pei, believing that neither was suitable to be chancellor and being ashamed to be chancellor with them, opposed the move. Emperor Xianzong disbelieved Pei and commissioned Huangfu and Cheng as chancellors anyway. After Wang submitted to imperial orders, Li Shidao also offered to surrender three of his 12 prefectures and submit to imperial orders, but soon reneged on the offer. Emperor Xianzong thus declared a general campaign against Li Shidao. During the campaign, Tian Hongzheng offered to immediately attack Li Shidao, but Pei, pointing out to Emperor Xianzong that if he did so, per regulations at the time, the Weibo soldiers would have to be supplied by the imperial treasury immediately. He thus suggested that Weibo soldiers be kept at Weibo until winter 818. Emperor Xianzong agreed, and when Tian finally launched his attack in winter 818, the attack was effective and crossed the Yellow River into Pinglu territory. In spring 819, Li Shidao's subordinate Liu Wu killed Li Shidao and surrendered Pinglu to imperial control.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. After the campaign against Pinglu was complete, it was said that because of various accusations that Huangfu and his associates made against Pei, Pei was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shandong) and the mayor of its capital Taiyuan Municipality, continuing to carry the title of chancellor as an honorary title.  During Emperor Muzong's reign  In 821, during the reign of Emperor Xianzong's son Emperor Muzong, Chengde and Lulong (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) soldiers rebelled under the leadership of Wang Tingcou and Zhu Kerong, respectively, killing Tian Hongzheng (whom Emperor Muzong had transferred to Chengde) and imprisoning Zhang Hongjing (a former chancellor that Emperor Muzong had transferred to Lulong). Emperor Muzong put Pei Du in command of the overall operations against Chengde and Lulong, but soon effectively gave that responsibility to Du Shuliang () as Du was put in command of the armies trying to relieve Niu Yuanyi (), the prefect of Shen Prefecture (Ê∑±Â∑û, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), who was holding out against Wang. Further, it was said that the imperial scholar Yuan Zhen, who wanted to be chancellor, and the eunuch Wei Hongjian (), were apprehensive that if Pei were victorious, he would again be in charge of the government, and thus interfered with requests that Pei submitted to Emperor Muzong. When Pei submitted an accusation against Yuan and Wei, Emperor Muzong felt compelled to demote Wei and strip Yuan of his status as imperial scholar, but was said to continue to trust Yuan. Nevertheless, with the imperial forces paralyzed by their need to receive imperial approval on decisions the generals were making and unable to prevail over Wang and Zhu, despite having a large numerical advantage and despite the presence of Pei and capable generals Wu Chongyin and Li Guangyan. By 822, Emperor Muzong abandoned the campaign and commissioned Zhu, then Wang, as military governors of their circuits. (It was said that his doing so was also at Yuan's behest, as Yuan did not want to see Pei continue to wield military command.) Despite their receiving commissions, Zhu and Wang did not relent on their siege of Shen Prefecture. Pei sent them letters rebuking them, and Zhu subsequently withdrew. Wang continued his pressure on Niu, however, and Niu eventually had to fight his way out of the siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242.) After the campaign ended, Pei was initially made Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) and defender of Luoyang, continuing to carry the honorary chancellor title. After the advisorial officials submitted many petitions pointing out that Pei had both civilian and military talents and should not be left in a largely ceremonial position, Emperor Muzong did not change Pei's commission initially but ordered him to first report to Chang'an to meet the emperor before heading for Luoyang. While Pei was at Chang'an, he apologized for being unable to defeat Wang and Zhu. Meanwhile, around the same time, Liu Wu, who had been made the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), had detained the imperial eunuch monitor Li Chengjie () after Li Chengjie had disrespected him and further plotted with his subordinate Zhang Wen () to arrest him and replace him with Zhang. Pei suggested issuing an edict executing Li Chengjie, believing that such a move would regain Liu's faithfulness to the imperial government, but Emperor Muzong, as both he and his mother Empress Dowager Guo favored Li Chengjie, did not do so. Rather, he accepted Pei's alternative suggestion to order that Li Chengjie be exiled. Only after such an edict was issued did Liu release Li Chengjie, but thereafter Liu began to disobey imperial orders. Shortly after the incident involving Liu Wu, Pei was commissioned to serve as the military governor of Huainan Circuit. However, the advisorial officials again petitioned to keep Pei at the central government. Emperor Muzong thus kept Pei at the capital as chancellor and sent Wang Bo to Huainan instead. However, an incident shortly after would lead to both Pei and Yuan (who had been made chancellor by this point as well) both losing their chancellor positions. During the Chengde campaign, the official Yu Fang () had suggested to Yuan that emissaries be sent to Chengde to persuade Wang Tingcou's officers to release the siege against Shen Prefecture. Soon, however, a rumor developed that Yu and Yuan were plotting to assassinate Pei. One Li Shang () reported the rumored plot to Pei, but Pei took no heed of it. Li Shang instead reported it to the imperial Shence Army. Emperor Muzong ordered an investigation, headed by the official Han Gao (). No positive evidence that Yu and Yuan plotted to assassinate Pei was discovered, but both Pei and Yuan were relieved of their chancellor duties, with Pei being made You Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), and Yuan made the prefect of Tong Prefecture (ÂêåÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). When advisorial officials again objected, Emperor Muzong stripped Yuan of his additional title as director of Changchun Palace () but left the orders otherwise unchanged. Li Fengji was made chancellor. In winter 822, Emperor Muzong suffered a stroke after being shocked by the accidental death of a eunuch at a polo game. As he was unable to rule on the petitions by the officials, the government was thrown into confusion and alarm. At the urging of Pei and Li Fengji, Emperor Muzong created his oldest son Li Zhan crown prince. It was said that because Li Fengji disliked Pei, and his associates often criticized Pei, In 823, Pei was sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). However, contrary to the customs at the time when former chancellors were sent out to be military governors, he was not given an honorary chancellor title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243.  During Emperor Jingzong's reign  In 824, by which time Emperor Muzong had died and been succeeded by Li Zhan (as Emperor Jingzong), Wang Tingcou, upon hearing the Niu Yuanyi, who had been serving as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), had died, slaughtered Niu's family, which he had detained at Chengde. Emperor Jingzong, hearing reports of the Niu household being slaughtered, sighed and blamed the incident on the chancellors' lack of ability. The imperial scholar Wei Chuhou pointed out that Pei Du had great accomplishments but had been squeezed out of the chancellorship. Further, Emperor Jingzong saw that whenever Pei submitted reports, he did not list an honorary chancellor title among his titles. Wei blamed Li Fengji's machinations for this, and the chancellor Li Cheng also advised that Pei should be shown more respect. Emperor Jingzong thus conferred the honorary chancellor title on Pei, although he did not recall Pei at that time. In winter 825, after Emperor Jingzong had sent several messengers to Shannan West's capital Xingyuan Municipality () to confer with Pei and secretly asking him to request a trip to Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor, Pei did so. He arrived in Chang'an in spring 826, and, despite attacks Li Fengji and his partisans laid on Pei (including intimations that Pei had been prophesied to be emperor and was having designs on the throne), Pei was again made chancellor. Under Pei's advice, Emperor Jingzong abandoned his plans to visit Luoyang (after Pei pointed out the expenses it would take to repair the palaces at Luoyang and the palaces on the way from Chang'an to Luoyang). Meanwhile, at that time, both Wang Tingcou and Zhu Kerong were submitted impolite petitions that, on the surface, offered to send troops to help repair Luoyang's defenses, but were intending to threaten the imperial government, Emperor Jingzong, per Pei's advice, acted without undue alarm and simply declined their offers.  During Emperor Wenzong's reign  Around the new year 827, Emperor Jingzong was assassinated by the eunuch Su Zuoming (). The eunuch Liu Keming () wanted to support Emperor Jingzong's brother Li Wu the Prince of Ji√†ng as emperor, but another faction of eunuchs, headed by Wang Shoucheng, Yang Chenghe (), Wei Congjian (), and Liang Shouqian (), killed Liu, Li Wu, and Liu's associates, and instead supported another brother of Emperor Jingzong's, Li Han the Prince of JiƒÅng (note different tone than Li Wu's title) as emperor (as Emperor Wenzong). Before Emperor Wenzong could formally take the throne, Pei served as regent for three days. Meanwhile, around this time, Li Quanl√ºe () the military governor of Henghai Circuit (Ê©´Êµ∑, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) had also died, and his son Li Tongjie tried to take control of the circuit. Emperor Wenzong tried to induce Li Tongjie not to do so by offering him the military governorship of Yanhai Circuit (ÂÖóÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong), but Li Tongjie refused. Emperor Wenzong ordered the military governors of the circuits around Henghai to attack Li Tongjie. Of those, Shi Xiancheng the military governor of Weibo was secretly in communication with Li Tongjie, as the two families had a marital relationship, but Pei, not knowing this, believed Shi to be dependable. Wei Chuhou, who was also chancellor by this point, however, told Shi's emissaries that he was aware of Shi's communications with Li Tongjie, and Shi thus did not dare to openly aid Li Tongjie. In 829, when Li Deyu the governor of Zhexi Circuit (ÊµôË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) was recalled to serve as deputy minister of defense, Pei recommended Li Deyu to be chancellor, but due to the eunuchs' recommendations, another deputy minister, Li Zongmin, was made chancellor instead. Subsequently, by this point, Pei was also serving as the director of finances. His colleague Lu Sui, however, opined that chancellors should not also handle financial matters, pointing out the prior examples of Yang Guozhong, Yuan Zai, and Huangfu Bo. Pei thus resigned his post as director of finances, but remained as chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. In 830, Pei, as he was old by this point, offered to resign his chancellorship. Emperor Wenzong, in response, made him Situ (Âè∏Âæí, also one of the Three Excellencies) and gave him the unusual chancellor title of Pingzhang Junguo Zhongshi (), ordering him to report for duties only once every three or five days. Soon thereafter, however, as Li Zongmin resented Pei for having recommended Li Deyu over him, he had Pei sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit, carrying the honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). Once he reported to Shannan East Circuit, at his request, a large grazing range at Shannan East that was used to breed military horses, which was not yielding much results, was abolished, and the fields were returned to the farmers. In 834, he was made the defender of Luoyang. In 835, he was given the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (). Later that year, after a major outward clash of between the officials headed by Zheng Zhu and Li Xun and the powerful eunuchs, known as the Ganlu Incident, led to the deaths of four chancellors (Li Xun, Wang Ya, Jia Su, and Shu Yuanyu) and massive eunuch reprisals against those viewed as Zheng's and Li Xun's associates, Pei urged leniency, and it was said that some 10 families were spared because of his efforts. In 837, Pei was again made the military governor of Hedong Circuit as well as the mayor of Taiyuan. Pei declined on the basis that he was too old to command an army, but Emperor Wenzong did not agree, issuing an edict that praised Pei but not changing the orders, so Pei was required to report to Hedong. In winter 838, he grew ill, and he requested to return to Luoyang to try to recuperate. In spring 839, Emperor Wenzong instead recalled him to Chang'an to serve as chancellor with the title of Zhongshu Ling. After he arrived at Chang'an, however, he was too ill to receive the commission officially and was permitted to return home. He died shortly after and was given great posthumous honors. When Emperor Wenzong inquired about why Pei did not have a final petition as was customary for officials at the time prior to death, Pei's family submitted a draft that he had partially written ‚Äî in which Pei had expressed concerns that Emperor Wenzong did not yet create a crown prince, and in which Pei did not make requests on behalf of family members ‚Äî as was also customary at the time.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. Pei Du had 7 sons. The old book of Tang and new book of Tang only included 5 of them and thus omitted 2 remaining sons. However, the list of chancellors of new book of Tang listed all 7 of his male children. Historians did not say anything about his female offspring.

The band's music has been called metal, more specifically \\"avant-garde\\" metal, but incorporates a variety of other styles, making the classification even more difficult. Known for its unusual sound and the lyrics, as well as bassist Jean Baudin's 11-string bass. Nuclear Rabbit has a large fan base despite being a perpetually underground and independent band. They are arguably one of the most well known underground bands in California, having more mainstream bands like Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm, and Deftones opening for them. Biography Nuclear Rabbit was started in 1989 by bassist Jean Baudin, who was influenced by a variety of music styles, including Fishbone, Primus and Bad Brains, and envisioned having a band not bound to any genre. He was soon joined by guitarist Pat Garner and drummer Steve \\"Stymie\\" Sigaty. Originally Baudin performed the vocals, but Greg Parrish was eventually asked to step in as vocalist. Nuclear Rabbit incorporates a variety of genres in their music, including metal, funk, ska, hardcore, punk, jazz, East Indian, and Egyptian. Baudin uses a variety of bass techniques, including tapping, slapping and popping. Their music is often characterized by sudden tempo changes and wacky musical stylings. The band recorded several demos, some of which are included on the compilation Vicuna. After a quick switch of guitarists, Nuclear Rabbit recorded their first full-length album, Intestinal Fortitude, in 1998. Soon after, Greg left the band and was replaced by Jon Scullion, with whom they recorded their More Human EP. In 2000, following More Human, Nuclear Rabbit went on hiatus. During this time Jean and Steve formed an alternative rock style group called Element of Surprise, often stylized as \\"E:OS.\\" The band was formed as a supergroup of underground artists, eventually including vocalist Andy Slipka of Tribal Disco Noise and guitarist Raye Medeiros of Ten Man Killer. Medeiros left the band some time after, and Baudin asked Pat Garner to step in. They recorded two demos,\\"2:001\\" and ', before the band called it quits in 2002. Nuclear Rabbit reunited in 2002 with its original line-up and recorded their 2nd full length, Mutopia, the title being a portmanteau of the words mutation and utopia. The album was well received, but the band went through more line-up changes following the supporting tour. A few shows were played in the Northern California area in 2008 with new guitarist Macy Mullen, as well as new drummer Timothy Bailey, though the band is now currently on an unofficial hiatus, with a status of \\"Writing New Tunes!\\" on their official MySpace page for 3 years with no updates. In August, 2011, the band announced their first show in three years via JeanBaudin.com, and played an hour-long set on October 8, 2011, at 924 Gilman in Berkeley, CA. Since Nuclear Rabbit's last show, Greg Parrish and Jason Branyan formed a band called Tree Of Shame with bassist, Erik Robertson and drummer, Todd Sipes. They released an album titled \\"A Series of Uncomfortable Thoughts and Feelings\\" in 2015. Tree Of Shame have since disbanded but Branyan, Robertson, and Sipes continue performing under the moniker, Mythborn.

A battery pack built together with a battery management system with an external communication data bus is a smart battery pack. A smart battery pack must be charged by a smart battery charger.  Functions  Safety circuit for 4 cell LiFePO4 batteries with balancer  Monitor  A BMS may monitor the state of the battery as represented by various items, such as: * Voltage: total voltage, voltages of individual cells, minimum and maximum cell voltage, or voltage of periodic taps * Temperature: average temperature, coolant intake temperature, coolant output temperature, or temperatures of individual cells * State of charge (SOC) or depth of discharge (DOD), to indicate the charge level of the battery * State of health (SOH), a variously-defined measurement of the remaining capacity of the battery as % of the original capacity * State of power (SOP), the amount of power available for a defined time interval given the current power usage, temperature and other conditions * State of Safety (SOS) * Coolant flow: for air or fluid cooled batteries * Current: current in or out of the battery Electric vehicle systems: energy recovery * The BMS will also control the recharging of the battery by redirecting the recovered energy (i.e.- from regenerative braking) back into the battery pack (typically composed of a few batteries, each composed of a few cells).  Thermal management  Battery thermal management systems can be either passive or active, and the cooling medium can either be air, liquid, or some form of phase change. Air cooling is advantageous in its simplicity. Such systems can be passive, relying only on the convection of the surrounding air, or active, utilizing fans for airflow. Commercially, the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius both utilize active air cooling of their battery systems. The major disadvantage of air cooling is its inefficiency. Large amounts of power must used to operate the cooling mechanism, far more than active liquid cooling. The additional components of the cooling mechanism also add weight to the BMS, reducing the efficiency of batteries used for transportation. Liquid cooling has a higher natural cooling potential than air cooling as liquid coolants tend to have higher thermal conductivities than air. The batteries can either be directly submerged in the coolant or coolant can flow through the BMS without directly contacting the battery. Indirect cooling has the potential to create large thermal gradients across the BMS due to the increased length of the cooling channels. This can be reduced by pumping the coolant faster through the system, creating a tradeoff between pumping speed and thermal consistency.  Computation  Additionally, a BMS may calculate values based on the above items, such as: * Maximum charge current as a charge current limit (CCL) * Maximum discharge current as a discharge current limit (DCL) * Energy [kWh] delivered since last charge or charge cycle * Internal impedance of a cell (to determine open circuit voltage) * Charge [Ah] delivered or stored (sometimes this feature is called Coulomb counter) * Total energy delivered since first use * Total operating time since first use * Total number of cycles  Communication  The central controller of a BMS communicates internally with its hardware operating at a cell level, or externally with high level hardware such as laptops or an HMI. High level external communication are simple and use several methods: * Different types of serial communications. * CAN bus communications, commonly used in automotive environments. * Different types of Wireless communications. Low voltage centralized BMSs mostly do not have any internal communications. They measure cell voltage by resistance divide. Distributed or modular BMSs must use some low level internal cell-controller (Modular architecture) or controller-controller (Distributed architecture) communication. These types of communications are difficult, especially for high voltage systems. The problem is voltage shift between cells. The first cell ground signal may be hundreds of volts higher than the other cell ground signal. Apart from software protocols, there are two known ways of hardware communication for voltage shifting systems, Optical-isolator and wireless communication. Another restriction for internal communications is the maximum number of cells. For modular architecture most hardware is limited to maximum 255 nodes. For high voltage systems the seeking time of all cells is another restriction, limiting minimum bus speeds and losing some hardware options. Cost of modular systems is important, because it may be comparable to the cell price. Combination of hardware and software restrictions results to be a few options for internal communication: * Isolated serial communications * wireless serial communications  Protection  A BMS may protect its battery by preventing it from operating outside its safe operating area, such as: * Over-current (may be different in charging and discharging modes) * Over-voltage (during charging), especially important for lead‚Äìacid and Li-ion cells * Under-voltage (during discharging) * Over-temperature * Under- temperature * Over-pressure (NiMH batteries) * Ground fault or leakage current detection (system monitoring that the high voltage battery is electrically disconnected from any conductive object touchable to use like vehicle body) The BMS may prevent operation outside the battery's safe operating area by: * Including an internal switch (such as a relay or solid state device) which is opened if the battery is operated outside its safe operating area * Requesting the devices to which the battery is connected to reduce or even terminate using the battery. * Actively controlling the environment, such as through heaters, fans, air conditioning or liquid cooling225x225px  Battery connection to load circuit  A BMS may also feature a precharge system allowing a safe way to connect the battery to different loads and eliminating the excessive inrush currents to load capacitors. The connection to loads is normally controlled through electromagnetic relays called contactors. The precharge circuit can be either power resistors connected in series with the loads until the capacitors are charged. Alternatively, a switched mode power supply connected in parallel to loads can be used to charge the voltage of the load circuit up to a level close enough to battery voltage in order to allow closing the contactors between battery and load circuit. A BMS may have a circuit that can check whether a relay is already closed before precharging (due to welding for example) to prevent inrush currents to occur.  Optimization  221x221pxIn order to maximize the battery's capacity, and to prevent localized under-charging or over-charging, the BMS may actively ensure that all the cells that compose the battery are kept at the same voltage or State of Charge, through balancing. The BMS can balance the cells by: * Wasting energy from the most charged cells by connecting them to a load (such as through passive regulators) * Shuffling energy from the most charged cells to the least charged cells (balancers) * Reducing the charging current to a sufficiently low level that will not damage fully charged cells, while less charged cells may continue to charge (does not apply to Lithium chemistry cells) * Modular charging http://www.metricmind.com/audi/14-battery.htm  Topologies  Cable Data transfer module BMS Wireless Communication BMS technology varies in complexity and performance: *Simple passive regulators achieve balancing across batteries or cells by bypassing charging current when the cell's voltage reaches a certain level. The cell voltage is a poor indicator of the cell's SOC (and for certain Lithium chemistries such as LiFePO4 it is no indicator at all), thus, making cell voltages equal using passive regulators does not balance SOC, which is the goal of a BMS. Therefore, such devices, while certainly beneficial, have severe limitations in their effectiveness. * Active regulators intelligently turning on and off a load when appropriate, again to achieve balancing. If only the cell voltage is used as a parameter to enable the active regulators, the same constraints noted above for passive regulators apply. * A complete BMS also reports the state of the battery to a display, and protects the battery. BMS topologies fall in 3 categories: * Centralized: a single controller is connected to the battery cells through a multitude of wires * Distributed: a BMS board is installed at each cell, with just a single communication cable between the battery and a controller * Modular: a few controllers, each handing a certain number of cells, with communication between the controllers Centralized BMSs are most economical, least expandable, and are plagued by a multitude of wires. Distributed BMSs are the most expensive, simplest to install, and offer the cleanest assembly. Modular BMSs offer a compromise of the features and problems of the other two topologies. The requirements for a BMS in mobile applications (such as electric vehicles) and stationary applications (like stand-by UPSs in a server room) are quite different, especially from the space and weight constraint requirements, so the hardware and software implementations must be tailored to the specific use. In the case of electric or hybrid vehicles, the BMS is only a subsystem and cannot work as a standalone device. It must communicate with at least a charger (or charging infrastructure), a load, thermal management and emergency shutdown subsystems. Therefore, in a good vehicle design the BMS is tightly integrated with those subsystems. Some small mobile applications (such as medical equipment carts, motorized wheelchairs, scooters, and fork lifts) often have external charging hardware, however the on-board BMS must still have tight design integration with the external charger. Various Battery balancing methods are in use, some of them based on state of charge theory.

These latter guns were later replaced by a pair of QF 2-pounder (40 mm) \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft guns. The ships were also fitted with two above-water twin mounts for torpedoes. Construction and service The ship was launched from the yards of Swan, Hunter & Wigham Richardson, Wallsend, on 5 June 1913 under the name HMS Sarpedon. The destroyer was renamed HMS Laertes on 30 September 1913. She possessed three 4-inch guns and four torpedo tubes, and was designed to operate in British coastal waters against enemy surface and submarine shipping. Laertes became part of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla based at Harwich. She took part in the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, where she was seriously damaged suffering four shell strikes. The most serious struck the boiler room, temporarily cutting off all steam supplies to the engines leaving the ship motionless. Another shot destroyed the middle funnel, while a gun was also hit. While Laertes was seriously damaged and stopped in the water, went to her aid under heavy fire. Lieutenant Commander Gye manoeuvred to pass a tow, but in getting underway the towing hawser parted. Laertes was saved only by the arrival of the battle cruiser . The ship managed to restore some power but had to be towed back to England.

Laertes was one of the destroyers of the Harwich squadron which attempted to head off attacking German ships during the Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 25 April 1916. The ship was hit by shellfire damaging the boiler room, and would most likely have sunk except for the actions of Stoker Ernest Clarke. Clarke later died from burns received while saving the ship and was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.London Gazette No. 6213, 22 June 1916 Five of the crew were injured during the attack. Stoker Petty Officer Stephen Pritchard, who entered the cabin flat immediately after a shell had exploded there, and worked a fire hose, was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.Pritchard was later killed in the sinking of in December 1917.

Spencer Myrick (November 23, 1918 - November 24, 1991), was a conservative Democratic member of both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature for West Carroll Parish in northeastern Louisiana. Background Myrick was one of ten children born in Simpson County in south central Mississippi, to tenant farmers James Martin \\"Jim\\" Myrick and his wife, the former Allie Artimissa Parker. Prior to the Great Depression, the family relocated to West Carroll Parish, where they purchased a farm near Oak Grove. Myrick dropped out of school in the third grade to help his parents to work the farm. One of his brothers was Billie E. \\"Bill\\" Myrick, a country music figure from Odessa, Texas. Political life Myrick first entered state politics as an elected member of the House of Representatives, having served from 1956 to 1960 during the final administration of Governor Earl Kemp Long. During the following second administration of Governor Jimmie Davis, Myrick was an investigator for the since defunct Louisiana Sovereignty Commission, which monitored civil rights activists and communist infiltrators within the state. The panel was headed by Frank Voelker, Jr., a Tulane University Law School graduate and the former city attorney in his native Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish, located due east of Myrick's own West Carroll Parish. Voelker ran in the 1963 Democratic gubernatorial primary but polled few votes. In that same election, Myrick was nominated and then elected without opposition to the Louisiana State Senate. He served a single term from 1964 to 1968. Myrick did not seek reelection to the Senate in 1967. Instead, he ran unsuccessfully statewide for Louisiana insurance commissioner against the one- term incumbent Dudley A. Guglielmo. Myrick also worked periodically as an aide to Governor Earl Long, a confidant and friend. After his legislative years, Myrick and his wife, the former Marie Gammill (May 13, 1918-June 19, 1998) resided in Baton Rouge, where Myrick died. Mrs. Myrick died in Monroe, where she was then residing.

Etymology The specific name, medusa, refers to the Greek mythological female monster, Medusa, who had venomous snakes for hair.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Bothriopsis medusa, p. 175). Description Adults of B. medusa usually grow to in total length (including tail). The maximum reported total length is (Roze, 1966) or slightly longer (Sandner-Montilla, 1975). The body is moderately slender. The scalation includes 20-21 (usually 21) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 160-168/153-162 ventral scales in males/females and 51-62/46-56 mostly undivided subcaudal scales in males/females. On the head, the canthals, internasals and rostral are elevated to form a distinct canthal ridge. There are 1-6 intersupraoculars, 6-9 (usually 7) supralabial scales and 8-10 sublabial scales. The color pattern consists of a tan, yellowish brown, reddish brown, gray or olive ground color overlaid with a series of long and irregular transverse bands. These bands are dark brown with pale centers, weakly subdivided laterally and separated from each other with short and lightly colored interspaces. In some individuals the contrast may be so poor that they appear to have a uniform dorsal coloration. The belly is yellow with many small and dark spots and flecks. On the head, a dark postocular stripe is present that frequently fuses with the first lateral body blotch. It is marked above and below by a pale narrow border.

Landmarks To the west of the moshav is Wadi Tannur, a riverine gulch with two natural springs - Ein Mata (Spring of the Orchard) and Ein Tannur. At the foot of Ein Tannur (\\"Oven Spring\\") is an ancient tunnel dug deeply to catch the water at the source and increase its flow - a spring- flow tunnel.Ein Mata, Horbat Hanut and Shevil HaKeisar According to a local legend, Noah's oven was located nearby before the flood. When God destroyed the world, Noah's oven began spouting water, proving Noah's great commitment to God. When the flood was over and the water subsided, the oven forgot its original purpose and water continued to flow from it. When Noah passed by in his ark, he only saw the spring rather than his oven, so he continued his journey and finally landed on Mount Ararat.

Durkheim attributes the development of religion to the emotional security attained through communal living. His study of totemic societies in Australia led to a conclusion that the animal or plant that each clan worshipped as a sacred power was in fact that society itself. Halfway through the text, Durkheim asks, \\"So if [the totem animal] is at once the symbol of the god and of the society, is that not because the god and the society are only one?\\" According to Durkheim, early humans associated such feelings not only with one another, but as well with objects in their environment. This, Durkheim believed, led to the ascription of human sentiments and superhuman powers to these objects, in turn leading to totemism. The essence of religion, Durkheim finds, is the concept of the sacred, the only phenomenon which unites all religions. \\"A religion,\\" writes Durkheim, \\"is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden‚Äîbeliefs and practices which unite into a single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.\\"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1915): Translated by Joseph Ward Swain, p. 47 Durkheim concludes: > In summing up, then, we must say that society is not at all the illogical or > a-logical, incoherent and fantastic being which it has too often been > considered. Quite on the contrary, the collective consciousness is the > highest form of the psychic life, since it is the consciousness of the > consciousnesses. Being placed outside of and above individual and local > contingencies, it sees things only in their permanent and essential aspects, > which it crystallizes into communicable ideas. At the same time that it sees > from above, it sees farther ; at every moment of time, it embraces all known > reality ; that is why it alone can furnish the mind with the moulds which > are applicable to the totality of things and which make it possible to think > of them. It does not create these moulds artificially ; it finds them within > itself ; it does nothing but become conscious of them.(445) Durkheim means that the symbolization of the collective consciousness is done through the totemic animal. It is through this 'flag' that Australian Aboriginals become conscious of themselves within a system of knowledge given by the group itself. Durkheim examined religion using such examples as Pueblo Indian rain dances, the religions of aboriginal tribes in Australia, and alcoholic hallucinations.

Hornung. It featured his popular character A. J. Raffles a well-known cricketer and gentleman thief. It was the fourth and last in his four Raffles books which had begun with The Amateur Cracksman in 1899.http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/h/e-w-hornung/mr- justice-raffles.htm The novel was published in the UK by Smith, Elder & Co., London, and in the US by Scribner's, New York.Rowland, p. 281. Unlike the three previous works, the book was a full-length novel and featured darker elements than the earlier collections of short stories. In it a jaded Raffles is growing increasingly cynical about British high society. He encounters Dan Levy, an unscrupulous moneylender, who manages to entrap a number of young men, mostly sons of the wealthy, by giving them loans and then charging huge amounts of interest. Raffles takes it upon himself to teach Levy a lesson. At the end of Hornung's second Raffles short story collection The Black Mask, Raffles and his companion Bunny Manders volunteer for service in the Second Boer War in 1899 where he was killed at the hands of the Boers. Hornung had intended this as a patriotic finale to his hero's story. However there was great popular demand for the return of the character, and a number of generous publishing offers, and Hornung agreed to write another book. In this he has been compared to Arthur Conan Doyle's decision to resurrect Sherlock Holmes after disposing of the character in \\"The Final Problem\\"; however, unlike Doyle's revelation that Holmes had actually survived the plunge over Reichenbach Falls, Hornung set Mr. Justice Raffles before the events of the Boer War. The comparison between the resurrections of Holmes and Raffles is made interesting by the fact that Doyle and Hornung were brothers-in-law. Indeed, prior to \\"officially\\" resurrecting Holmes, Doyle had used much the same technique with The Hound of the Baskervilles, his first post-Reichenbach Holmes story. The title contains a more direct reference to Holmes, being a parody of \\"Mr. Justice Holmes\\" - that is, the American jurist (and later Supreme Court Justice) Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., one of the many inspirations for the great detective. Its reception was mixed, with some fans lamenting the loss of the carefree gentlemen thief of the early stories. It was the last Raffles work written by Hornung, although a number of continuations have been written by other authors in a mixture of parody and homage. Plot After an absence of three weeks, Raffles tells Bunny he has been taking the cure at Carlsbad as an excuse to try to steal jewelry from the wife of moneylender Dan Levy (who Bunny calls Mr. Shylock), but returned early to watch his young cricket prot√©g√©, Teddy Garland, play at Lord's. At the Albany, however, they catch Teddy writing himself a check from Raffles's checkbook. Raffles easily forgives the distraught Teddy, who is seriously in debt to Levy, due to Levy's unfairly high interest. Raffles sends Teddy to sleep, then discusses Levy with Bunny. Levy, Teddy, and Belsize, illustration by E. F. Skinner Next morning, Raffles and Bunny trick Levy into accepting money that Levy had loaned to Raffles as payment for Teddy's debts. Back at the Albany, however, Teddy has disappeared. Teddy's father, Mr. Garland, arrives, looking for him. Raffles suggests they check Mr. Garland's home for Teddy, but Teddy isn't there, either. While Raffles goes to search at Lord's, Bunny distracts Teddy's fianc√©e, Camilla Belsize, who seems jealous of Raffles's friendship with Teddy. Raffles returns without Teddy, and lies about him to Belsize. Abruptly, Levy and Mr. Garland enter the room. Levy and Raffles do verbal battle with veiled threats. Teddy finally returns, and dismisses Levy from the house. Levy retorts that he owns the house: Mr. Garland has lost it through debt to him. Later, Levy visits Raffles and Bunny at the Albany. Levy suspects it was Raffles who stole (and then gave back) his wife's jewelry. He offers to forgive Raffles if Raffles will steal a document from an enemy lawyer. Raffles agrees to, on the additional condition that Levy forgive Mr. Garland's remaining interest payments. Next day, Raffles and Bunny watch Teddy play at Lord's. Bunny talks to Belsize, while Raffles leaves to prepare the burglary. At night, Bunny joins Raffles in the lawyer's house, where Raffles swaps Levy's document with a fake. They escape the house, while avoiding two bruisers who are chasing them under orders of Levy. They return to Levy, but Levy hurls a whiskey decanter at Raffles's face and throws the document into the fire. Bunny knocks Levy to the floor, rendering him unconscious. Raffles recovers, and he and Bunny drag Levy, via a canoe on the nearby river, to an empty house's tower. Raffles drugs Bunny's food, so that Bunny sleeps; when he wakes, Bunny sees Levy is awake, and restrained. Raffles playacts as a judge, and puts Levy on trial. Raffles blackmails Levy into signing off Mr. Garland's debt, and also into writing Raffles a check, though Bunny disapproves. Raffles leaves to cash it. Levy tries to struggle against Bunny, but Bunny scares him off with a revolver, which mysteriously returns to his hand it drops to a lower floor. Raffles returns and sends Bunny to the Albany, but Bunny instead visits Belsize. She confesses that she had secretly been in the tower, and had returned the revolver to Bunny's hand unseen, but makes Bunny swear not to tell. On the way home afterwards, Bunny spots Inspector Mackenzie going to Levy's house. At the Albany, Raffles insists that they pack and leave England. At first, the reason seems to be that Levy has been suddenly murdered, but on the continental train Bunny learns that Raffles is actually avoiding Belsize, who Raffles has feelings for. At a station, they encounter Mackenzie, who informs them that Levy was murdered by an unrelated debtor. All danger at home is now gone. Regardless, Bunny stays with Raffles. Several years later, Bunny, now Raffles's biographer of ruined reputation, runs into Teddy at a Turkish bath. Teddy eagerly bids Bunny to write all about the adventure involving him and his wife. Adaptations The novel was adapted in 1921 as a film, Mr. Justice Raffles, starring Gerald Ames as A. J. Raffles. It was adapted for television as the tenth episode of the popular British Raffles television series, with Anthony Valentine as A. J. Raffles and Christopher Strauli as Bunny Manders.

Built in the early 1830s, it is a prominent local example of Federal period architecture. It was built for a member of the locally prominent Bancroft family, who inherited a large tract of land in the area. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Joseph Bancroft House stands on the north side of Lowell Street (Massachusetts Route 129), at northeast corner of its junction with Bancroft Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, set back from the street on a lot that is fronted by a low fieldstone retaining wall. The roof is gabled, and the exterior is clad in wooden clapboards. The main facade is five bays wide and symmetrical, with a central entrance framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. There is no window above the entrance, and most windows are placed slightly lower than is typical for the Federal period. A single- story ell extends to the right of the main block with a dormered gable roof. The house was built on a large tract of land inherited by Joseph Bancroft. It may have been built around the time of Bancroft's marriage in 1833, and does not appear on an 1830 map of the town. The Bancroft family owned most of the Reading Highlands for many years; the area south of Lowell Street was inherited by Joseph's brother. An earlier Joseph Bancroft was prominent in the town for introducing the shoe manufacturing trade to the town, which was a cottage industry for many years.

The album version of the song has a duration of over six minutes and is divided into two sections: the first two minutes and fifty-four seconds are of a voice coaxing the listener through a hypnotic exercise, encouraging them towards a state of relaxation. The remainder of the song consists of Idol singing in a melodious, slow tempo. For its release as a single in the UK and Europe, a radio edit of the track was created by Hancock. Background Within the biography section of the custom floppy disk included with the press pack edition of the Cyberpunk album, the song was described by Mark Frauenfelder: In a 1993 interview, Mark Younger- Smith, who played keyboards and guitar on the Cyberpunk album, commented on the song's origins: \\"The more techno-y and intense songs like \\"Heroin,\\" \\"Adam in Chains,\\" and \\"Venus,\\" started out as a sequenced track laden with keyboards. First we'd set a mood, then Billy would create a lyric.\\" Aside from the song's music video, Idol also performed the song live on The Arsenio Hall Show in July 1993, along with the Cyberpunk track \\"Wasteland\\". Music video A music video for \\"Adam in Chains\\" was directed by Julien Temple. It depicted Billy Idol bound in a chair with a chip inserted into his neck as he is monitored by scientists. He struggles before being hypnotized, and is then inserted into a virtual reality simulator. There he is treated to an ethereal water fantasy. Idol eventually rejects the fantasy, which is consumed in flames as, in the real world, his body violently convulses. The scientists end the experiment and Idol is brought back into reality, only to fall unconscious. There was also a shorter version of the video featuring an edited intro and female backing vocals, using different shots than the full-length video. Critical reception Musician, in a 1993 issue, described the song as \\"New Age lull\\". Robert Christgau, in his review of Cyberpunk, commented: \\"So \\"Adam in Chains,\\" which after a long spoken intro devolves into what a vulgarian might take for his latest love-gone-bad rant, is in fact \\"a prayer for the tomorrow people and power junkies.\\"\\" AXS.com later featured the song as one of Idol's \\"five most underrated songs\\" in a retrospective look back over Idol's recording career. Writer Kareem Gantt felt the song was a \\"gem\\" from a \\"subpar\\" album and commented: \\"It's a weird song, for sure, but it's a single that you won't be able to pull from once you hear it.\\" Formats and track listings European CD single #\\"Adam in Chains\\" (Edit) - 3:46 #\\"Adam in Chains\\" (Album Version) - 6:23 Netherlands CD maxi-single #\\"Adam in Chains\\" (Edit) - 3:46 #\\"Adam in Chains\\" (Album Version) - 6:23 #\\"Venus\\" - 5:45 #\\"Heroin\\" (Needle Park Mix) - 5:12 UK CD single #2 #\\"Adam in Chains\\" (Album Version) - 6:23 #\\"Tomorrow People\\" - 5:04 #\\"Mony Mony\\" - 4:00 Chart performance The track failed to chart in the UK, however it did chart in France at No. 5 and Poland at No. 35.

The children's maternal grandparents were George Miller CB (born 1833), Assistant Secretary in the Education Department and a member of the Athenaeum Club, and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of the Rev. Peter Aubertin; while their great-grandfather was the Rev. Sir Thomas Combe Miller, 6th Baronet (1781‚Äì1864). Mallaby's great-uncles on this side of his family included Sir Charles Hayes Miller, 7th Baronet (1829‚Äì1868) and Sir Henry John Miller (1830‚Äì1918), who became Speaker of the New Zealand Legislative Council. Career Arms of St Bees, where Mallaby was headmaster After a year of teaching at Clifton College, Mallaby became a master at St Edward's School, Oxford, in 1924. In 1926, health problems took him to South Africa, where he taught at the Diocesan College, Rondebosch. In 1927 he returned to St Edward's, where he became a housemaster in 1931. On 22 September 1933 was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of the school's Officer Training Corps, resigning his commission on 7 March 1936. He was an exceptional schoolmaster, teaching literature as well as classics, and also coached rugby football. At St Edward's one of the boys he taught was Robert Gittings, later a poet and biographer, who after Mallaby's death wrote an article on him for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.Tolley, G., Gittings, Robert William Victor (1911‚Äì1992), poet and writer in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online version (subscription required), accessed 10 August 2008 From 1935 to 1938 Mallaby was headmaster of St Bees School in Cumberland, and in 1938 he took the first step towards a new career in the public service by becoming District Commissioner for the special area of west Cumberland, with the task of alleviating the problem of unemployment. During the Second World War, Mallaby was briefly deputy regional transport commissioner for the north-western region of England. Late in 1940 he became a general staff officer at the War Office, and in 1942 was posted to the Joint Planning Staff, becoming its secretary the next year. In this role he attended conferences of the Great Powers at Cairo (November, 1943), Quebec (September, 1944), and Potsdam (July to August, 1945). Mallaby was commissioned onto the British Army's general staff list as a Second Lieutenant on 6 December 1940, promoted Captain and Major in 1941, Lieutenant-Colonel in 1943, and Colonel in 1945. With the end of the war, he was secretary of the National Trust for a year until 1946, then an assistant secretary in the Ministry of Defence, and from 1948 to 1950 secretary-general of the Western Union Defence Organisation, a forerunner of NATO. In 1950, he became an under-secretary in the Cabinet Office and a key civil servant in British foreign and defence policy. In 1954, at the time of the Mau Mau Uprising, he went to Kenya as secretary of the war council and council of ministers. From 1955 to 1957 he was deputy secretary of the University Grants Committee, then from 1957 to 1959 a diplomat, as High Commissioner of the United Kingdom in New Zealand, and in 1959 became first civil service commissioner in charge of recruitment to H. M. Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service, a role which later brought him work as a private recruitment consultant. Retirement In 1964, Mallaby retired to live in East Anglia and was elected an Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, graduating Master of Arts of Cambridge in 1965. In 1967 he chaired a committee on local government officers, which led to The Mallaby Report. In 1971, he chaired the Hong Kong government's Salaries Commission, and in 1972 to 1973 chaired a special committee on the structure of the Rugby Football Union, which led to a change in the rule for kicking to touch which is said to have revived the game. Mallaby also became a governor of St Edward's School, Oxford, chairman of the Council of Radley College, and vice-chairman of Bedford College, London. Publications Wordsworth In 1932, Mallaby edited a selection of William Wordsworth's poems for the Cambridge University Press, in which he included two thousand lines of The Prelude. In 1950, the centenary of Wordsworth's death, he wrote a critical biography, Wordsworth: a Tribute, and in 1970 he edited Poems by William Wordsworth for the Folio Society, with an introduction. From my Level (1965) and Each in his Office (1972) are memoirs of his own life.

Built about 1754, this -story wood-frame house is good local example of a Georgian colonial house with later Federal period alterations. It also demonstrates a typical pattern of shared ownership by multiple descendants of one of its owners. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Damon house is set on the north side of South Street in a residential area of southwestern Reading. Facing south, it is a -story wood-frame structure, five bays wide, with a side-gable roof, clapboard siding, granite foundation, and twin interior chimneys. An integral leanto extends the building the south, extending west beyond the edge of the main block. An ell extends further to the rear, resting on a rubblestone foundation. The main facade has a central entry with flanking pilasters and an entablature. Windows are arranged symmetrically, but not evenly spaced. The house was built sometime before 1754 by Joseph Damon, and a portion was inherited by his son Jabez. The house was to remain in divided ownership by members of the Damon family for more than 100 years, the various shares being finally united in 1870 by Rufus Damon. This method of dividing and sharing houses was not particularly unusual in rural settings where buildings were expensive to build. The saltbox form, while typical in New England, was unusual in Reading, where framed extensions are more often found in houses of this period.

Kemp was politically active at the local level, serving on the school committee. A subsequent owner opened one of the nation's first dollar stores in Boston.

They were however granted special leave to remain under the provisions of the Polish Resettlement Act 1947.Michael Hope, The Abandoned Legion, Veritas Foundation Publication , Paperback First Edition Chapter \\"The Transfer of Diplomatic Recognition\\" From that time until 1990, the Federation represented the interests of Polish settlers in relation to the United Kingdom authorities. Following the emergence in 1990 of Poland as a state no longer within the Soviet bloc, its Presidential Insignia, kept until then in London, were ceremonially transferred by President Ryszard Kaczorowski to President Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa in Warsaw. At that juncture certain responsibilities remained vested in The Federation.Peter D. Stachura, Editor The Poles in Britain 1940-2000, Frank Cass, 2004, , Paperback First Edition Page 45 The Federation became recognised by both Polish and British governments, along with other Polish organisations worldwide, as the organisation representing the Polish minority in Great Britain.  Activities within its remit  In 2008, the Federation submitted a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission over claims that the Daily Mail had run a series of articles defamatory to Poles. The PCC arranged a compromise between the Federation and the Daily Mail, whereby the Daily Mail promised to remove the offending articles from their website.  Membership  The Federation was originally set up to bring together the various Polish organisations across Great Britain. Subsequently, a change in the statutes introduced Individual Membership. This has opened membership to Poles permanently resident in Great Britain, members of their families, people of Polish heritage and anyone else supporting the aims of The Federation.

Salinger, published in Mademoiselle in May 1947. The story has not been published in any anthology. It is of literary interest today largely because the character of Ray is seen as an early version of the character Seymour from Salinger's better known work \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\".  Plot  Shoeless Joe and Field of Dreams The story is also of interest to film buffs. The name of the main character, Ray Kinsella, is also the name of the main character in the 1982 book Shoeless Joe by W. P. Kinsella (who coincidentally shares the character's last name) which was adapted into the film Field of Dreams (1989). W.P. Kinsella, who had never met Salinger, created a wholly imagined character (aside from his being a recluse) based on the author of The Catcher in the Rye, a book that had great meaning to him when he was a young man. To get a feel for Salinger, he re-read his body of work. \\"I made sure to make him a nice character so that he couldn‚Äôt sue me.\\" Salinger had also used the surname shared by writer and protagonist in The Catcher in the Rye (Holden Caulfield's roommate Richard Kinsella). Known for his litigiousness, Salinger contacted Kinsella's publisher via his attorneys to express outrage over having been portrayed in Shoeless Joe and intimated he would sue should the character \\"J. D. Salinger\\" appear in any other medium, should Shoeless Joe be adapted. In the novel Shoeless Joe, Ray Kinsella seeks out J. D. Salinger, although in the film this character was renamed Terence Mann as the movie producers were worried over being sued by Salinger. The producers believed that it was not significant to jettison Salinger, as they figured only 15% of the potential audience would know who the author was. Kinsella told Maclean's Magazine in a 2010 interview on the death of Salinger that many of the book's readers believe that Salinger is a wholly fictional character. Kinsella denied that Salinger, as a writer, had any real influence on his own writing.  References  Short stories by J. D.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Masonic Block is set at the northwest corner of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28) and Haven Street in Reading's central business district. It is a three-story brick structure with stone trim. The facade facing Main Street is five bays wide, that facing Haven is nineteen bays, and there is a bay in an angled corner between. The first level houses modern commercial storefronts, with plate glass windows sheltered by awnings. The upper floor bays are all sash windows, and are divided into groups of varying size by projecting piers that rise to the roof. A band of corbelled brickwork separates the second and third levels, and the third level is topped by a band of limestone, above which is a row of blind arches, giving the third-floor windows the appearance of being set in arched openings. This row of arches is separated from the roof by a band of more heavily corbelled brickwork. The block was built in 1894, displacing a private residence that was disassembled and relocated. At the time, the lane to the south was private; it was widened and named Haven Street in honor of the first minister of the Third Parish, Thomas Haven. It was built by the Reading Masonic Temple Corporation, a private stock company composed of local businessmen. Longtime tenants of the building included Willis' Drug Store, the Reading Chronicle (publisher 1894-1932), and the local Masonic lodge, which occupied the third floor. The building was extended to the north in 1929, a space that was occupied by jeweler Millard F. Charles. Charles over time acquired a controlling interest in the ownership corporation, which was renamed the Millard F. Charles Corporation in 1972.
