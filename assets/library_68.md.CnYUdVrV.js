Colonel Allan (Allen) Bell (14 February 1870 ‚Äì 15 October 1936) was a New Zealand Member of Parliament for the Bay of Islands in Northland.  Early life  Bell was born at Southbridge, New Zealand on 14 February 1870. He was the son of Allen and Mary, farmers in the area. He worked as a bushman and a farmer. In 1895, Bell travelled to southern Africa and served with the British armed forces that in 1896 suppressed a rising by the Matabele (Ndebele) people. He then saw active service with the Rhodesia Regiment during the South African (Boer) War. Bell was discharged on 31 January 1900 and returned to Taranaki. On 29 January 1902 he married James Helen Shaw Lambie at Pihama. They bought land at Te Rapa, north of Hamilton. Their daughter Elaline was born there on 6 July 1904. Hamilton and the Waikato Bell was a member of the Waipa County Council and the Hamilton Borough Council. He was the founder of the Waikato Agricultural and Pastoral (A & P) Association and the first director of the Waikato Dairy Company in 1912. As a conservative, Bell stood for the electorate at the 1908 general election for the opposition, but lost to the incumbent from the Liberal Party, Henry Greenslade. At the 1911 general election Bell stood as an unofficial Reform Party candidate in the newly formed Raglan electorate; the official Reform Party candidate was Richard Bollard. Bell came into conflict with the party's executive over liquor licensing issues, as \\"it was used not for the purpose of raising the status of politics, but in the interest of the liquor party.\\" During the campaign Bell created controversy when he advocated the abolition of the monarchy, and the creation of a New Zealand republic. He also argued for the abolition of New Zealand's upper house and Britain's House of Lords. As a result of his comments, the Reform Party disendorsed Bell as their candidate. The armed forces considered that Bell had broken his Oath of Allegiance as an Officer (Lieutenant Colonel). Under pressure, he reluctantly resigned his commission in January 1912. Legion of Frontiersmen In 1911, Bell joined the New Zealand Command of the Legion of Frontiersmen and after his discharge from the army went on to devote much of his time and energy into the promoting and expanding the Legion. Bell was appointed as the Legion's Commandant for Auckland with the rank of Colonel. He retained and used this Legion of Frontiersmen rank for the rest of his life. In 1912, Bell journeyed to Dargaville and met with local men Dick Long, Andy Knudson and one other met in the Central Hotel in Dargaville one winter's night and formed the Northern Wairoa (Mounted Rifles) Squadron of the Legion. In 1913, as Commandant of the Auckland District Bell convened and chaired a meeting of the Legion in the \\"Hall of Commerce\\" for the purpose of considering the viability of setting up a Dominion Executive of the Legion, the election of a Commandant for the North Island and other matters. A ballot was taken by A Squadron's secretary, Frontiersman Thomas E. Whitton, which showed a large majority in favour of a Dominion Executive, a five shilling annual levy for its support, and election of Colonel Bell as the North Island Commandant of the Legion. Captain Forbes- Eadie LOF moved that the current Auckland Executive be disbanded and that Colonel Bell's new executive take over. This was unanimously approved. At the conclusion of the meeting Colonel Bell referred to the great loss sustained by the Defence Forces by the very recent death of Mrs Brewis (of Hamilton), who was the first woman in New Zealand to assist in organising the universal military training movement. Northland In 1914, three Bell brothers (Allen, Leonard and Walter) bought land in what is today Kaitaia. He was an enthusiastic promoter of the area north of Auckland, and did much lobbying for making the area accessible via roads and bridges. He acted as a land agent and was a newspaper editor, first writing for the Northern Age and then founding the Northlander. Bell was a supporter of the government's scheme of draining land in the Kaitaia area, and as an owner of swampy land and a land agent, he personally benefited from the initiative. Member of Parliament Bell received a requisition in September 1922 for the upcoming election and agreed to stand in the Bay of Islands electorate on the condition that he could be an Independent. He stood for opposition interests (at the time, William Massey's Reform government was in power) and was variously described as an Independent or Independent Liberal. He won against the incumbent of the Reform Party, Vernon Reed. In 1925, Bell successfully stood for the Reform Party, but was defeated by Harold Rushworth of the Country Party in 1928. The election result was declared void, but in the subsequent 1929 by-election Rushworth was again elected. Death Bell retired in Paua on the Parengarenga Harbour. He died there on 15 October 1936.

Government experts and analysts believe that her 47,000 voter registration total is a nationwide record in the United States and in the state of California. Levin, a deputy county registrar, worked without pay on a strictly volunteer basis. Biography Levin was born in Brooklyn, New York, on September 14, 1917, and raised in both Brooklyn and New Jersey. She relocated to southern California during the 1940s, eventually settling in Santa Monica. A single mother of two children, Levin held a variety of jobs. She worked in an aircraft plant, garment factory, at the original Los Angeles Farmers Market and as a beach attendant in Santa Monica. Voter registration efforts Levin credited her son, Chuck Levin, with sparking her interest in civics and voter participation. Chuck Levin, a Santa Monica writer and political consultant, created the First Vote campaign. The campaign registered young people to vote once the voting age was lowered to 18 years old in 1971 with the adoption of the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Sylvia Levin took notice of her son's campaign. Sylvia Levin began working as a deputy voter registrar outside Canter's Deli in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles in 1973. She gradually expanded her voter registration efforts to several communities throughout Los Angeles County's Westside, including Westwood Village, Malibu, Venice and Westwood. Levin spent six days a week commuting by bus to reach her work locations. She became a fixture for 36 years outside several locations in the Westside. Levin could be found registering prospective voters at the same locations each week. On Sundays, she worked outside the Westwood Village Farmers' Market. She set up her stand outside the post office at the Federal Building in Westwood on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Levin worked outside the post office or a bank in Malibu on Fridays, while on Saturdays she moved to a location outside the Sunya Currie jewelry store on Abbot Kinney in Venice. In it estimated that Levin registered 47,000 new California voters between 1973 and 2009, an individual record both in the state of California and the United States. Additionally, Levin is believed to have spoken to approximately 470,000 people during the 36 she spent in voter registration. Levin registered 60 new voters on a single day in 1996, a presidential election year. The number dipped to an average of four new voters a day during the 2000s. Levin received official recognition for her work. Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky awarded Levin a plaque for her \\"outstanding service\\" in 1996. The late state Senator Herschel Rosenthal honored Levin with a resolution in the California state senate in 1999. She was also nominated by then California assemblyman Paul Koretz and formally inducted into the California Voter Participation Hall of Fame in 2001. U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman remarked in the Congressional Record in 1997 that Levin \\"has done more to increase voter participation than virtually anyone we know.\\" On Sep 14, 2007, which was Levin's 90th birthday, she was honored in a resolution by the Los Angeles City Council for her state voter registration record and 34 years of volunteer service to her communities. The resolution honoring Levin, which was introduced by Los Angeles City Councilman Bill Rosendahl, read, \\"the appreciation felt by so many thousands of people have been touched by [her] tireless enthusiasm for voting and who have applauded her commitment.\\" Levin continued registering new voters right up to the time she was hospitalized on May 18, 2009. Sylvia Levin died of complications from a stroke at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on June 25, 2009, at the age of 91. She was survived by her daughter, Susan Levin, son, Chuck Levin, and two sisters, Dottie Sadowsky and Daisy Neustadt. On June 30, 2009, L.A. city councilman Bill Rosendahl adjourned the city council proceedings in Levin's memory.

A barnacle is typically used to correct a defect in the product or as a way of enhancing the product with new functionality. A barnacle is normally a quick fix that is used until the product design can be redone incorporating the barnacle into the actual product so that when manufactured, the barnacle step in manufacturing is no longer required. A barnacle may also be added in the field in order to correct a design or manufacturing defect. Origin The term appears to have originated from the crustacean barnacle which is an animal that attaches itself to rocks, docks, ships, whales, and other objects where it grows. A barnacle in electronics is something added to the manufactured product. Typically a barnacle on a circuit board is very noticeable, much like the mollusc variety on a rock in the sea. Use in software While the term was originally used with electronic hardware, it has also migrated into the software industry where is it is used to describe software that is added to a system. The connotation in the software industry is that a software barnacle is code added as an expedient without regard to the original design intent. A software barnacle may also refer to malware or spyware which has been inserted into a computing system illegally. Examples A 'barnacle' or engineering prototype fix in the form of wires and cut tracks on a printed circuit board On printed circuit boards, a barnacle may be as simple as cutting a trace, soldering a wire in order to connect two points on the circuit board, or adding a component such as a resistor or capacitor. A barnacle may also be a complex subassembly or daughterboard. Barnacles in hardware assemblies allow an engineer to repair design errors, experiment with design changes or enhancements, or otherwise alter circuit behaviour. Although usually a barnacle-implemented change is incorporated into a new fabrication cycle circuit before production, occasionally there are final-assembly barnacles. In such cases it is determined to be less expensive to add a barnacle to a final, shipping product rather than re-spin the circuit to ship without these interventions left in place. Use The normal development cycle for electronic hardware contains two main phases. The first phase is the development and prototype phase in which the hardware is first designed (and often simulated using a computer program such as PSpice) and the design manufactured in low quantity as prototypes for testing. The second phase is the updating of design documents based on the testing experience and the beginning of general manufacturing of the product. During the testing phase, problems are usually found as the design and simulation tools can not duplicate some types of environmental as well as electrical circumstances in which the product may be used. During the testing phases, barnacles are often used to patch (computing) or correct the hardware so that testing can continue in the face of defects (failures or faults) found. The goals of adding barnacles at this phase are to reduce development costs by using the prototype hardware for as long as it can be used, to test hardware changes before the design documentation is updated, and to reduce development time by not requiring a new version of the prototype hardware to be manufactured. During general manufacturing of the product, the product may sometimes be used in circumstances which the specifications indicate would be acceptable however when the product is actually used in those circumstances, a problem is encountered. Engineering will typically perform a root cause analysis in order to determine the root cause of the problem. In some cases, manufacturing changes may need to be made such as trace contaminants being introduced during some phase of manufacturing. In other cases, the problem has to do with the design of the product and a change has to be made in the product design. When a product design change is required, often and when possible, a barnacle is designed so that existing products can be modified with the design change using the barnacle. By using a barnacle, the idea is that existing products do not need to be scrapped and replaced so in this case the use of a barnacle is an economic decision. The barnacle work may be done in the field using portable tools and components or it may require a product recall with the barnacle work being done on the manufacturing floor.

Frederikke Benedichte Dannemand, born as Bente Frederikke Mortensdatter Andersen Rafsted (6 August 1790 ‚Äì 23 December 1862) is known in history as the royal mistress of King Frederick VI of Denmark.  Biography  She became the mistress of Frederick when she was fifteen or sixteen, which means it would have been in 1805 or 1806. In 1808, she was installed at Toldbodvej nr. 289 under the name ‚ÄùFru Dannemand‚Äù (Mrs Dannemand\\"), where he visited her daily. They had several children, who were ennobled or married to nobles. In 1814, she was told that the king had been unfaithful during his absence in Vienna, and when he returned in 1815, he found her gone and pregnant. The fatherhood of her next child was never established. In 1818, the relationship with Frederick was restored and she was back at Toldbodgade, and in 1819, she had another child. In 1829, she was given the rank and title normally held by the spouse of a colonel, despite the fact that she was not married to one. The same year, her children with the king were ennobled. When King Frederick died in 1839, she was brought to his lit-de-parade at the royal palace to mourn by his corpse alongside his widow, the queen dowager. When she died, she was given a military funeral in recognition of the colonel-rank given to her by the monarch.  Legends  In one story, she came to the royal palace to beg the regent personally to spare the life of her father, who had been arrested for theft. Johan B√ºlow suggested that the regent took her as a \\"stand-in\\" for his consort, who was exhausted after all her childbirths. She became the mistress of the king in 1805 or 1806, and her father's life was spared.Theodor Ewalds: Fru Dannemand  References  * Theodor Ewalds. Fru Dannemand. * Else Kornerup.

He is known primarily from the saga Forbhais Droma D√°mhgh√°ire, in which he is assisted by the famous Mug Ruith, who repels an invasion of his kingdom by Cormac mac Airt. The sons of Fiachu Muillethan were Ailill Flann M√≥r and Ailill Flann Bec. Like his father √âogan M√≥r, grandfather Ailill Aulom, and great- grandfather Mug Nuadat, Fiachu Muillethan appears to be mainly fictional. The circumstances of his life are entirely legendary, seemingly invented so as to provide the E√≥ganachta with an ancestral contemporary of Cormac mac Airt. This is apparent from the conception of Fiachu as described in the Cath Maige Mucrama. While the career of Fiachu Muillethan may be entirely legendary, that of his supposed great-grandson Conall Corc, the true founder of the E√≥ganachta, may preserve an amount of historical fact. As in many such cases, Muillethan and Fer Da Liach may have started out two different figures later thought to be the same, whether mythological or historical. The medieval genealogists are at pains to assert they were identical but base their argument only on the story of Fiachu's birth in the Cath Maige Mucrama, a well known saga of political fiction.

History Agnone was first mentioned in 1187, when close to the modern village the small church of \\"Santa Maria de Hercula\\" (or S.M. ad Herchia) was built.  Geography  The village is situated in the central- northern area of Cilento by its coast. It is far 3 km from Montecorice, 6 from Acciaroli, 7 from Case del Conte, 13 from Santa Maria di Castellabate, 24 from Agropoli and 21 from the ancient Greek town of Velia. Agnone is composed, outside from its center, by several little surrounding localities: San Nicola a Mare (the seat of the port), San Nicola dei Lembi, Rosaine, Ripe Rosse, Magazzeni, Capitello, Punta Capitello, Guarino and Parco Marghetto. Tourism The village, part of Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park, is strongly receptive for tourism, especially on summer, due to its links to Agropoli, Salerno and Naples (by buses and hydrofoils) and to the quality of its water; which suddenly give it the Blue Flag beach.

It is one of only two bridges to carry motor vehicles across the harbour in central Copenhagen, the other being Langebro. The bridge, the fifth on the site, is 115 metres long and was inaugurated in 1937. History=1620: The first bridge= Knippelsbro in c. 1650Co The first bridge between Copenhagen and Christianshavn was constructed in 1618-20 by Christian IV in connection with the foundation of Christianshavn. The bridge was called the \\"Great Amager Bridge\\" or \\"the long bridge\\". =1712: The second bridge= A new wooden bridge was built in the same location in 1712. It was decorated with four Hercules sculptures by the artist Johan Christopher Sturmberg. Neither the sculptures or images of them exist today. =1816:The third bridge= The bridge was replaced by a new, wooden bridge in 1816. The bridge had two gates which were decorated with four wooden sculptures of \\"The Four Winds\\". They were created by the sculptor Frederik Christian Willerup and are now owned by the Museum of Copenhagen. =1869: The B&W; bridge= In 1868-69, Burmeister & Wain constructed a railway bridge based on renderings from the grocers J. Adolphs and Christian August Broberg. It ran from Slotsholmsgade to Torvegade and it was therefore possible to use the old bridge while it was built. It opened on 1 August 1869. =1908: Axel Berg's bridge= The 1906 bridge A new railway bridge was built in 1908. It was designed by the architect Axel Berg and had two characteristic pavilions. It was built by the Port Authority's building master H. C. V. M√∏ller and opened on 30 December 1908. It ran from B√∏rsgade to Torvegade. =1937: The current bridge= In the first half of the 1930s, it was once again decided to build a new bridge. It was decided to build it at the same site as the old one and it was therefore necessary to build a temporary bridge. It was in use from 1934 to 1937. The current Knippelsbro was inaugurated on 17 December 1947. It was designed by Kaj Gottlob and built by Wright, Thomsen & Kier in collaboration with Burmeister & Wain. =Name= The bridge was originally known as Store Amager Bro (English: Great Amager Bridge) or Langebro (English: Long Bridge) and from around 1700 Christianshavns Bro (English: Christianshavn's Bridge) is seen. The current name stems from Hans Knip who became bridge caretaker in 1641, in charge of operating the bridge and collecting tolls from passing ships. His house became known as Knippenshus and during the 17th century the bridge became known as Knippensbro. The current form of the name is seen from the second half of the 19th century but has never been officially approved.

They were founded in 1980 when an ad was placed in the Village Voice looking for gay men interested in playing soccer in an area of Central Park known as the Ramble. This was the birth of the New York Ramblers, the world's first organized openly gay soccer club. The Ramblers provided a space for gay men who enjoyed the sport to meet and socialize outside of the traditional settings of bars and clubs. Shortly after the beginning of the Ramblers, more gay soccer clubs began forming around the country. In conjunction with this, the original members of these first clubs organized the International Gay and Lesbian Football Association (IGLFA),International Gay and Lesbian Football Association which today has over twenty women‚Äôs teams and thirty men‚Äôs teams in its membership. The Ramblers have traveled the country and globe participating in various soccer tournaments, from the Philadelphia Pumpkin Patch and Provincetown Classic to the Munich Oktoberfest Tournament and many IGLFA World Championships IGLFA World Cup 2009 and Gay Games Gay Games held throughout the world. The league hosts the New York Indoor ClassicCheer NY at NY Indoor Classic held every winter. In addition to weekly matches and practices, the Ramblers also host social events throughout the year and participate in other various leagues in the New York metropolitan area. Established in 2016 as a means of giving back to the community, the Ramblers Scholarship supports student athletes pursuing an undergraduate education who openly self-identify as LGBT, or as demonstrated and committed straight allies. Ramblers Scholars are awarded for helping to break down stereotypes about LGBT people in sports. As the only scholarship geared toward LGBT student athletes, it serves as a vital resource for many young people who qualify. Following the annual June 1st application deadline, up to two one-time scholarships of $2,500 each are awarded publicly to cover tuition fees.https://nyramblers.com/scholarship/ The principal agenda of the Ramblers is to provide a comfortable and fun space for all people, regardless of their skill, sexual orientation, gender, race or religion; to come together and enjoy the competition and sport of soccer, good friends and to be a part of the ongoing Ramblers family.

Summary Se-joon and Se-wa are twins who are very close. In childhood, Se-wa fell ill and required a heart transplant, but her body rejects the new heart unless she takes her medication. Se-wa's struggle for life or death caused Se-joon to realize what she means to him, and his possessiveness became dark and deep. In public it seems as if Se-joon is embarrassed by his sister. He keeps her secluded from others, so she won't meet friends other than himself. Se-wa succumbs to Se-joon. When Se-joon gets a girlfriend, Su-in, Se-wa's jealous. Se-joon and Se-wa meet a boy who introduces himself as an old friend, Sung- chan, but who turns out to be Gi-hoon. Se-wa becomes friends with Sung-chan, and gradually opens up throughout the manwha. Se-joon's girlfriend discovers Se-joon's true feelings for Se-wa, and breaks up with him. Jealous, Se-joon starts harboring a deep hatred towards Se-wa who he feels has betrayed him, and towards Sung-chan who's stealing what Se-joon believes is his. During a class reunion, Se-joon meets the real Sung-chan who resembles Gi-hoon superficially. Gi-hoon's sibling and mother died, and Gi-hoon claims that Se- wa stole his little brother's heart for her transplant. His mother committed suicide after Gi-joon's brother's death. He also says that although he initially approached her because of the transplant, he started to develop feelings towards her as their relationship progressed. Se-joon chases Gi-hoon out of the house. In pent up frustration, Se-joon commits the sin which he feared the most: making love with his twin sister Se-wa. The next day he goes to church to confess. Gi-hoon follows Se-joon and finds out about Se-joon's sin. He confronts Se-joon, who clubs him on the head and leaves him for dead, although Gi-hoon was brought to the hospital by a witness to the attack. Se- joon's fear that someone would take Se-wa away from him caused him to commit his second sin. Se-joon flees with Se-wa to their grandmother's houser in the country. Se-wa tried to call Gi-hoon, as she distrusts Se-joon, after what he did to Gi-hoon. Her unstable heart is acting up, without her anti-rejection medications. Se-joon doesn't realize the seriousness of the situation and dismisses Se-wa's concerns. Se-wa starts to cough blood. Se-joon immediately rushes her to the hospital, but to no avail. She soon quietly passes away. At the funeral of Se-wa, Se-joon meets Gi-hoon who is still recovering from his injuries. Se-joon is very afraid of what he might say or do but all he does is look deep into Se-joon eyes and say \\"This is all your fault\\". Distraught, Se Joon goes into shock and secludes himself from his family. His mother goes in to call him out to dinner only to find that he had slit his right wrist and in the other he carries a picture of him and Se-wa laughing happily together. The epilogue is closed with the story of the boy that was loved by all. In a flashback, Se-wa asks Se-joon if he would choose to be loved by all or loved by one, and he replies that he would rather be loved by one. However deep in his head he thinks, \\"But it is impossible because I-\\" The story ends and what he was about to say is never revealed. Fan discussion shows that most believes he was about to say \\"I love you\\".

Mills was an American photographer, Civil War veteran, and a D.C. judge. He is best known for his 1858 photographs from along the Oregon Trail and California Trail. Early years Born October 8, 1833 in Washington, D.C., Samuel C. Mills was the son of John and Mary Mills. As a young man, he worked in his father's shoe factory. In 1856, he began working in the photography studio of Blanchard P. Paige on Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C.Washington Post, Oct. 15, 1905. On the Road to Utah, 1858 In February 1858, Captain James H. Simpson, an officer in the U.S. Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers, was assigned to the reinforcements being sent to Utah Territory as part of the so-called Utah War.Barbara Beeton, \\"James Hervey Simpson in the Great Basin,\\" Montana the Magazine of Western History (Winter 1978) pp. 28-43. W. Turrentine Jackson, Wagon Roads West: A Study of Federal Road Surveys and Construction in the Trans-Mississippi West, 1846-1869 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964), 146-157. Simpson decided that one of his first projects would be to remap the main emigrant trail on his way to Utah and to create a new guidebook for the Army and civilian emigrants. Having become interested in the photographs of the Crimean War by British photographers Roger Fenton and James Robertson, Simpson decided that he would \\"illustrated some of the more notable features of the route by photographic impressions.\\" If successful, his would be the first emigrant guidebook illustrated through the lens of a camera.Ephriam D.

The expedition's instrument wagon near Fort Laramie, 1858. By Samuel C. Mills. Library of Congress. In late March 1858, Captain Simpson submitted a request to hire a photographer at $40 per month and an assistant photographer at $25 per month, exclusive of their traveling expenses. He then hired twenty-five year old Samuel C. Mills as his expedition photographer and Edward Jagiello as his assistant.Simpson, in his privately published book The Shortest Route to California (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co., 1869) p. 32 mistaken gave the name of the photographer as C.C. Mills, which led later historians astray. Peter E. Palmquist and Thomas R. Kailbourn, Pioneer Photographers of the Far West: A Biographical Dictionary, 1840-1865 (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000), 323, 402-404. They departed in April 1858 and camped for a month at Fort Leavenworth to complete their planning and to test out their equipment. The wood crates packed with instruments, including their new camera, arrived on April 28. Captain Simpson noted in his diary that Mills and Jagiello were soon practicing, producing views of an artillery battery at the post. Among Mills and Jagiello's surviving photographs are three views of buildings at Fort Leavenworth. The expedition departed Fort Leavenworth on May 31, 1858 and headed west, with Mills producing photographs along the way. At Fort Kearny, Captain Simpson turned over the supervision of his topographical party to his most senior lieutenant, J. L. Kirby Smith, while he traveled in advance as a member of General William S. Harney's staff. Among the instructions that Simpson left for Smith was specific guidance for the expedition's artists. \\"Photographic pictures of as many prominent scenes as possible will also be taken,\\" Simpson wrote, \\"including Fort Kearney, Court House & Chimney Rocks, Fort Laramie & every other proper object or scene.\\" Later on the trail, Simpson sent back instructions for Smith to get a good view of Ash Hollow, noting that such \\"would make a fine illustration for the report.\\" He again emphasized the importance of securing \\"as many views taken of remarkable topographical and geological features of the region traversed as possible... even if the party is delayed by it.\\" Lieut. Smith's small survey party complied. \\"Stopped at Court House Rock on our road today,\\" wrote one of the members of the expedition in his diary on July 25, \\"and Mills (the photographer) took a picture.\\" Extant images confirm that the photographers produced negatives of a number of important landmarks along their route‚Äîtoday the earliest surviving views from along the Oregon-California Trail. =Views From the Main Emigrant Trail, Summer 1858= By Samuel C.

At Camp Floyd, 1858-59 After three and a half long months on the road, the topographical party finally arrived at Camp Floyd, Utah Territory, on September 15, 1858. Simpson immediately sent Smith's party back out to help establish a new road between Camp Floyd and Fort Bridger through Timpanogos or Provo Canyon and they spent several months surveying the boundaries of the new military reservations at Fort Bridger, Camp Floyd, and Rush Valley. Returning to Camp Floyd, Simpson and his crew then drafted a lengthy report describing the roads of Utah Territory, complete with a detailed map. Simpson Expedition. Courtesy Library of Congress. As the survey team finally settled in at Camp Floyd for the winter, Mills and Jagiello were provided with a room for use as a photographic studio in one of the numerous adobe and wood structures just built at the post. Up to this point, the photographers had only produced \\"negative impressions on glass.\\" Now inside their simple darkroom, they began creating paper prints from the negatives. In addition, Simpson had one of his young subordinates, Lieutenant Haldimand S. Putnam, create a detailed map of Camp Floyd while he instructed Mills to take a number of views of this sprawling military encampment, at that time the largest military garrison in the country. Mills and his assistant produced a number of views of Camp Floyd. By early 1859, Simpson was increasingly concerned about his rapidly dwindling supply of photographic chemicals as well as about the dependability of his young photographer. A teetotaler himself, Simpson had become impatient with Mills' drinking habits and warned him on several occasions after he had become too incapacitated to perform his official duties. Finally on Jan. 19, 1859, following another incident at Camp Floyd, Simpson terminated Mills' employment with the expedition \\"to protect the Government and myself from imposition and wrong.\\" Mills pleaded for another chance and the officer finally acquiesced but with a stern warning against any further violations. The following day on Jan. 20, a small delegation of Utes led by the prominent leader and Mormon convert Arapeen, arrived at Camp Floyd to meet the post commander, General Albert S. Johnston. \\"The council broke up harmoniously, the Indians shaking hands, &c;,\\" Simpson noted in his diary. \\"They then adjourned to the photographic room where I had their likenesses taken in a group.\\" The following day, Mills produced a portrait of Arapeen and at least one view of the delegation standing in front of a Sibley tent. Looking back later upon his photographic experiment, Simpson characterized it as a failure. \\"The cause lies in some degree in the difficulty, in the field, at short notice, of having the preparations perfect enough to insure good pictures,\\" Simpson wrote in his final report, and \\"chiefly in the fact that the camera is not adapted to distant scenery.\\" He concluded that \\"a good artist, who can sketch readily and accurately, is much to be preferred.\\" In May 1859 as he set off on the next leg of his explorations across the Great Basin, Simpson left his photographer behind at Camp Floyd and instead used a sketch artist for the remainder of his expedition.Jesse G. Petersen, A Route for the Overland Stage: James H. Simpson's Trail Across the Great Basin (Logan: Utah State University Press, 2008). Simpson's party returned to Camp Floyd in early September 1859 and they soon began their return journey to the east coast, taking Mills with them. No photographs from this portion of the trip are known, suggesting that the camera and equipment had been packed away. The delicate glass plate negatives presumably were safely transported to War Department headquarters, though what ultimately became of them is not known. Samuel C. Mills' employment with the government ended upon their arrival back home. =Views Illustrative of Camp Floyd, U.T., January, 1859.= By Samuel C. Mills and Edward Jagiello.

Later history Judge Samuel C. Mills. Courtesy Washington Post, Oct. 15, 1905. After his return to D.C., Mills went back to work at Paige's studio on Pennsylvania Avenue. As the Civil War began, he was busy taking portraits of soldiers in the wartime capital. In 1864, Mills enlisted in the Union Army as a hospital steward and after the war ended, he returned to photographic work. Meanwhile, he studied law, passed the bar in 1872, and was appointed as a police judge in the district, a position he held for the remainder of his working life. In later years, Mills was an active member of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Masonic Order. The hard-learned lessons of his youth regarding alcohol may have been the impetuous for his founding the Sons of Jonadab, a temperance organization. Samuel Mills died on October 7, 1911 and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.Washington Post, Oct. 9 and Oct. 11, 1911. NotesBibliography * Dickson, Ephriam D.

Typically, the festival runs throughout the 2nd weekend of September every year. Now in its 9th year, it has become an established part of the calendar and has grown steadily year on year, now hosting two stages. With a 2nd stage introduced in 2008, the festival now has room for more local acts and less space between the performers. History Started in 2001,http://youlgravefest.com/History.htm the first year was deemed a success by the organisers, with over 1000 attending from the local area, and Philip Wildboar's own act, Fatfish, headlining, with this first festival only taking place on the Saturday. By 2002 the festival had decided to add entertainment for children, in the form of an inflatable slide, and slippery climbing frame, although still only taking place on the Saturday, the festival was now looking to be a regular event every year. 2003 saw the festival expand over the three days from the Friday through to the Sunday evening, and also saw the children's entertainment expand to include a bouncy castle. The format of the festival was to have local rock music on the Friday and Saturday evenings, with jazz played over the Sunday afternoon, featuring jazz vocalist Sally Doherty, alongside a free buffet and art gallery displaying works of local artists for sale. 2004‚Äì2008 saw the Sunday disappear from the event, with emphasis on the growth of the Friday and Saturday performers and stages.http://www2.chesterfieldtoday.co.uk/tiles/ents/MAM/MAM-28-08-08-018-E001.pdf > \\"We have always tried to have an eclectic mix of music but with just one > stage it was difficult. \\"It will cost more to run two stages but it will > make a more complete festival in terms of covering a much broader range of > musical styles and tastes. \\"We felt we raised the bar last year with the > standard of musicians so this was the only way forward,\\" ‚Äì Philip Wildboar Future 2009 sees the Festival earn its full license from the County Council allowing a more secure future for the event on its present site.

In the Second World War Westcott served in an anti-submarine role and escorted numerous Atlantic and Malta convoys. Construction and design On 9 December 1916, the British Admiralty placed an order for 21 large destroyers based on the V class, which became the Admiralty W class. Of these destroyers, two, Westcott and were ordered from the Scottish shipbuilders William Denny and Brothers. Westcott was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of between and depending on load. Displacement was standard, and up to deep load. Three oil-fed Yarrow boilers raising steam at fed Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines which developed , driving two screws for a maximum designed speed of . The ship carried of oil giving a range of at . Westcotts main gun armament consisted of four 4-inch Mk V QF guns in four single mounts on the ship's centerline. These were disposed as two forward and two aft in superimposed firing positions. A single QF 3-inch (76 mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun was mounted aft of the second funnel. Aft of the 3-inch gun, she carried six 21-inch torpedo tubes mounted in two triple mounts on the center-line. Westcott was laid down at Denny's Dumbarton, Scotland shipyard on 30 March 1917, and was launched on 14 February 1918. She was commissioned on 2 April and completed on 12 April. She was named after Captain George Blagdon Westcott, who was killed at the Battle of the Nile. Service On commissioning, Westcott joined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet, based at Rosyth in support of the Battlecruiser Force, remaining there for the remainder of the war. In 1919, the Grand Fleet was disbanded, and the Atlantic Fleet took its place, supported by four destroyer flotillas. Westcott joined the Second Destroyer Flotilla, based at Rosyth. In August 1919, the Second Destroyer Flotilla, including Westcott, was deployed to the Baltic as part of the British intervention in the Russian Civil War, relieving the First Destroyer Flotilla. The Second Flotilla remained in the Baltic until December 1919. In February 1920, Westcott was deployed to the Mediterranean, shelling Turkish forces during the Greco-Turkish War, before returning to Britain in August. In 1921, as large flotillas of sixteen destroyers had proved difficult to control, it was decided to reorganise the destroyers of the Atlantic Fleet, changing to six flotillas each comprising a Flotilla leader and eight destroyers. Westcott was assigned to the Sixth Flotilla. At some stage prior to 1931, the 3-inch gun was replaced by a 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\". Wescott remained with the Atlantic Fleet (and after 1932 the Home Fleet) until 1935 when she was refitted in preparation for duty with the Fourth Submarine Flotilla based on the China Station. One 4-inch gun and the aft set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a crane for retrieval of practice torpedoes fired by the submarines of her flotilla, and sonar was fitted. On 18 March 1936, Westcott suffered an accidental explosion when on exercise in the Mediterranean. One man was killed, with a further 10 injured. =Second World War= On the outbreak of the Second World War, Westcott was still allocated to the Fourth Submarine Flotilla, and was having her armament restored to suit her for full operational service. In January 1940, Westcott was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, reaching Malta on 14 February. In April 1940, she was recalled to British waters, reaching Devonport on 19 April. She was then assigned to operations off Norway as a response to the German invasion, taking part in the evacuation of British troops from √Öndalsnes on the night of 30 April/1 May, and continuing to operate off Norway for the rest of the month. In early June 1940 Westcott took part in the escort of a convoy (including the liners , , , and ) carrying Australian troops to the United Kingdom, on the leg from Gibraltar to Britain. Westcott then took part in Operation Ariel, the evacuation from ports in Western France of Allied troops who had remained in France following the evacuations from Dunkirk and Le Havre. Westcott was sent to Brest, but collided with the coaster Nyroca on 17 June, with both ships returning to the United Kingdom empty. On 4 July, Westcott joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Devonport for escort duties in the North Atlantic. On 5 July, the destroyer was detached from Convoy OB178 to investigate a possible submarine sighting. While hunting the submarine, , Whirlwind was torpedoed, blowing off the destroyer's bow. Westcott went to the aid of Whirlwind, rescuing the survivors of her crew and scuttling the stricken destroyer with torpedoes when it was realized that it would not stay afloat until rescue tugs would arrive. 57 of Whirlwinds crew were killed. On 2 September 1940, Westcott, with the destroyer , the sloops and and the corvette , joined inbound Atlantic convoy SC.2 as escort. Over the next few days, the convoy was subject to a series of attacks by German U-boats which sank five of the 53 merchant ships of the convoy (four of them by , commanded by G√ºnther Prien). This was the first successful Wolfpack attack of the Second World War. Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar aboard Westcott, 28 November 1945. Westcott had operated the device since 1941. In November 1940, Westcott transferred to the 5th Escort Group, based at Liverpool. On 16 January 1941, along with the Royal Navy tugs HMS Superman and HMS Tenacity, she rescued 143 survivors from , which had torpedoed and sunk in the Western Approaches. On 28 January, Westcott collided with the corvette , and after repair at Liverpool, which was slowed by German air raids, joined the 7th Escort Group, also based at Liverpool. Westcott was fitted with a prototype Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar, which replaced the forward 4-inch gun, in August 1941. As a test platform, Westcott became the first vessel to be equipped with Hedgehog. She remained part of the 7th Escort Group at the start of October 1941, and transferred to the Gibraltar Escort Group in December 1941. On 16 January 1942, the troopship was torpedoed and damaged by the German U-boat , but managed to reach Horta in the Azores. After limited repairs, Llangibby Castle left Horta for Gibraltar on the night of 1/2 February, with three destroyers of the Gibraltar Escort group, Westcott, and allocated as escorts. Westcott and Croome patrolled off the south exit from Horta harbour while Exmoor escorted Llangibby Castle through the North exit. The was waiting off the south exit and attempted to torpedo the two destroyers, but a technical fault forced the submarine to the surface, when U-581 attempted to flee to neutral Portuguese waters. An initial attempt by Westcott to ram the submarine failed, but resulted in Westcott dropping a pattern of shallow-set depth charges all around U-581. Westcott came around for a second ramming attempt, which was successful, sinking the submarine, with 40 of U-581s crew being picked up by Westcott and Croome, with one swimming to shore and four killed. On 19 April, Westcott formed part of the escort for the American aircraft carrier during Operation Calendar, an attempt to deliver vitally needed Spitfire fighters to Malta. 47 Spitfires were flown off Wasp on 20 April, with 46 reaching Malta. The Spitfires were quickly lost, however, and as a result another attempt was made to reinforce Malta's air defences, Operation Bowery. This time, Wasp was joined by the British carrier , with Westcott again part of the escort for the combined carrier force which met up off Gibraltar on the night of 7/8 May 1942, and flew off 64 Spitfires on 9 May, with 61 reaching Malta, managing to shore up the battered island's air defences. Westcott formed part of the escort for the carriers Eagle and when they flew off 17 Spitfires on 18 May in Operation LB, and for two more delivery runs by Eagle on 3 June and 9 June. On 11 June, Westcott joined the escort of a large supply convoy to Malta from the west, Operation Harpoon, with a second convoy, Operation Vigorous sailing simultaneously to Malta from Alexandria in Egypt. Both convoys came under heavy air attack, and on 14 June, the cruiser was damaged by a torpedo dropped by an Italian aircraft. Westcott and the destroyer were detached from the convoy to escort Liverpool back to Gibraltar, with Antelope taking Liverpool under tow. The three ships came under continued Italian torpedo-bomber attacks after they had left the convoy, and on 16 April, Westcott was hit by anti- aircraft fire from Liverpool, killing three of her crew. The three ships made Gibraltar on 17 June. Two of the six merchant ships in the convoy managed to reach Malta, with two destroyers being sunk as well as four merchant ships. The parallel Operation Vigorous was a failure, being forced to turn back by the weight of Axis attacks. Westcott took part in two more Spitfire delivery runs by Eagle in July. Malta was still short of supplies, and in August, another major convoy was run from Gibraltar, Operation Pedestal. The convoy left Gibraltar on 10 August, with Westcott part of the covering force of, including three aircraft carriers and two battleships, which was to escort the convoy to the Skerki Channel off Tunisia, leaving the remainder of the journey to a close escort of cruisers and destroyers. By the time the covering force, including Westcott, turned back on the evening of 12 August, the carrier Eagle had been sunk by a German submarine, and the carriers and damaged by bombers. Five merchant ships out of fourteen, including the vital tanker , finally made Malta by 15 August. In October 1942, Westcott escorted on another fighter delivery mission. In November 1942, the Allies launched Operation Torch the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa. Westcott formed part of the Centre Task Force, covering the landings at Oran in Algeria on 8 November. When the Vichy French submarines and attempted to attack the Allied fleet, they were sunk by Westcott and . After Torch, Westcott returned to the United Kingdom. Following her return from the Mediterranean, Westcott was converted at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard to long-range escort configuration. This involved removing one boiler and its associated funnel, allowing additional oil bunkers to be fitted, extending the ship's range by as much as . Withdrawn from service in June 1945, Westcott was sold to the British Iron & Steel Corporation (BISCO) to be scrapped the following year.

The USA Swimming rules at the time allowed for the USA National mark to be set by a swimmer who could represent the US in international competition (his dual citizenship allowed for this) and who at the time of the swim was not representing another country (he was swimming for the country-neutral Northwestern University at the time of the swim). USA Swimming's rules have subsequently been altered so that only swimmers currently representing the USA internationally can set the \\"American\\" Record.

His genre was particularly painting working men such as shepherds, crofters, pedlars, cobblers, fishermen and farm labourers. However he also painted Scottish country and coastal scenery.  Biography  Henderson studied at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and started to work as a portrait painter but having done so for about twenty years he discovered his true vocation which was marine painting. He marveled the painting of the sea in all its different conditions and light. He exhibited his work at the Royal Scottish Academy and at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. He also exhibited at the Royal Academy in London from 1871 to 1886 and in Suffolk Street Galleries from 1882 to 1884. He was the President of the Glasgow Art Club, in which city he settled in 1852. Family Henderson married three times: in 1855, Helen Cosh; in 1869, Helen Young of Strathaven (died 1871); and in 1872, Eliza Thomson. Two of his sons John Henderson (1860-1924) and J. Morris Henderson also known as Joseph Morris Henderson RSA (1863-1936) also became painters in their own right. His daughter Marjory Henderson (1856-1936) married the well known Scottish painter William McTaggart, who painted in 1894 a wonderful portrait of Joseph Henderson which was presented by the family of Joseph Henderson in 1925 to the Glasgow Museums.

Barnhill and Linious \\"Mac\\" McGee in 1932. The airline served McGee‚Äôs fur business and offered service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay. Although Barnhill & McGee Airways lasted for only two years, it was the forerunner of McGee Airways which was the forerunner of Alaska Airlines. Early history Harvey W. Barnhill nicknamed \\"Barney\\" Barnhill was a legendary, hard-drinking bush pilot. He came to Alaska in 1929 and was part of Carl Ben Eielson‚Äôs team in Fairbanks transporting personnel and a fortune in furs from the trading ship Nanuck that was stranded in the ice off the coast of Siberia. He flew in the search for the Eielson wreck after his fatal crash in the winter of 1929-1930. An Indiana native, Linious \\"Mac\\" McGee who subsequently worked as a miner, truck driver, dishwasher and fur buyer, came to Alaska in the fall of 1929 by stowing away on an Alaska-bound steamship looking for business opportunities, after several failed ventures. He became a fur buyer using dog teams & chartered airplanes. He needed an airplane of his own to go to some of the remote areas of Alaska to buy furs. McGee teamed up with \\"Barney\\" Barnhill in 1931, purchasing a three-seat Stinson SM8A aircraft for $5000 from Varney Airlines in San Francisco. They shipped the plane to Alaska on a steamship, taking it off the ship in Valdez, where they reassembled the airplane on the beach, flew it to Anchorage and formed Barnhill & McGee Airways. McGee learned to fly but preferred managing, so he hired other pilots and paid them a commission of the gross sales generated by the planes they flew. Operations For the first few months they used the Stinson only for McGee‚Äôs fur buying trips to remote villages, but by the middle of Jan 1932, they were running two display adds in the Anchorage Daily Times, one for McGee‚Äôs fur business and the other for Barnhill & McGee Airways as an airline offering service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay. Dissolved In the late spring of 1932, Barnhill & McGee dissolved their partnership after using a bank loan to purchase an additional Stinson. While Barnhill kept the newer Stinson at first, he sold it back to McGee when winter arrived. McGee went on to found McGee Airways flying out of Anchorage. Although Barnhill & McGee Airways lasted only a short time, it was the forerunner of McGee Airways which was the forerunner of Alaska Airlines.

Life He was the son and heir of John Howland, of the city of London, and Anne Greenway, of Cley in Norfolk. He was born at Newport Pond, near Saffron Walden, Essex, and baptised 26 September 1540. He was admitted pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 18 March 1558, but he migrated to St. John's College, where he graduated B.A. in 1561. He was elected a fellow of Peterhouse on 11 November 1562 and proceeded M. A. in 1564. His subsequent degrees were B.D. 1570, D.D. 1578. He was incorporated M.A. of Oxford on 9 July 1567. In 1569 he became rector of Stathern, Leicestershire, on the presentation of the master and fellows of Peterhouse. Initially, Howland was a follower of Thomas Cartwright, and signed the unsuccessful petition to Lord Burghley in 1571 asking that Cartwright might be allowed to return to Cambridge. He then changed his opinions, and after a sermon in a puritan vein in Great St. Mary's by John Millen or Milayn, a fellow of Christ's, in October 1573, he controverted its teaching in the same place during the afternoon.John Peile, Christ's College (1900), p. 83. Howland gained the confidence of Burghley, then chancellor of the university, and became his chaplain. By Burghley's influence, he was appointed to the mastership of Magdalene College, then almost in a state of bankruptcy, in 1576. When John Whitgift resigned the mastership of Trinity in June 1577, on his election to the see of Worcester, he strongly recommended Howland, a personal friend, to Burghley, as his successor. The queen, however, had already selected John Still, the master of St. John's, and it was arranged that Howland should be transferred from Magdalene to St. John's as Still's successor. He was admitted Master 20 July 1577, finding a college full of religious dissensions but with new statutes. In 1578 he served the office of vice-chancellor, in which capacity he, at the head of the university, waited on the queen on her visit to Audley End, on 27 July 1578, and presented her with a Greek Testament and a pair of gloves, making a suitable oration. In 1583 he was again vice-chancellor. The following year Whitgift, by this time archbishop, recommended his old friend for either of the vacant sees of Bath and Wells or of Chichester or, failing these, for the deanery of Peterborough; in 1584 the queen nominated him to the see of Peterborough. He was consecrated by Whitgift at Lambeth on 7 February 1585. The choice of a successor threatened to involve the college in a fierce internal struggle and it was arranged that Howland should continue to hold the mastership with his bishopric; he resigned in February 1586. Howland pleaded the cause of his diocese against the excessive tax for furnishing light horse. As bishop he took the first place at the funeral of Mary, Queen of Scots, in Peterborough Cathedral, in February 1587. The funeral cortege met at his palace, and after a great supper in his hall proceeded to the cathedral. On the death of Archbishop John Piers in 1594, Howland was earnestly recommended for the see of York by the lord president Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, and the council of the north; Matthew Hutton was appointed. The deprivation of Robert Cawdrey, vicar of South Luffenham, Rutland, led to a long dispute. Howland while bishop held the living of Sibson, Leicestershire, in commendam. He was rumored to have impoverished his bishopric for Burghley and was also the object of attacks of Martin Mar-Prelate. He died unmarried at Castor, near Peterborough, on 23 June 1600, and was buried in his cathedral, without any memorial or epitaph.

The first recorded cricket match in Australia took place in Sydney in December 1803 and a report in the Sydney Gazette on 8 January 1804 suggested that cricket was already well established in the infant colony. By 1826, clubs including the Currency Cricket Club, the Military Cricket Club and the Australian Cricket Club had been formed. Hyde Park and the Racecourse were the venue for these organised matches. The formation of clubs in Van Diemen's Land (later Tasmania) was not far behind with clubs formed in Hobart in 1832 and Launceston (1841). In Western Australia a match was arranged in 1835 between the \\"builders\\" (probably architects and engineers) of the new Government House and a team of labourers and \\"mechanics\\" (an archaic term for trades people). In Victoria in 1838, the Melbourne Cricket Club was formed ‚Äì it would become arguably Australia's most exclusive and influential cricket club. In 1839, a club was formed in South Australia. Intercolonial cricket in Australia started with a visit by cricketers from Victoria to Tasmania in February 1851. The match was played in Launceston on 11‚Äì12 February with Tasmania winning by 3 wickets. Another three matches between the two teams were played before 1854 but in time the crossing of Bass Strait became less attractive to the Victorians and the focus turned to the neighbouring colony of New South Wales. These matches attracted large crowds, including a crowd of 15,000 at a match in Sydney in January 1853. Boards of control were formed in the various colonies: New South Wales in 1857, Victoria in 1864 and South Australia in 1871. Early tours The first tour by an English team to Australia was in 1861‚Äì62, organised by the catering firm of Spiers and Pond as a private enterprise. Captained by HH Stephenson, the team largely consisted of cricketers from Surrey and while not wholly representative was reasonably strong. While the locals efforts, even when receiving odds, were mostly in vain, the tour was popular with spectators and highly profitable for the cricketers and promoters alike. A further tour followed in 1863‚Äì64, led by George Parr and was even more successful than the last. First Australian team to tour England Johnny Mullagh, one of the batsmen in the 1868 tour of England In 1868, Aboriginal cricketers became the first Australian team to tour England. The team was captained by Charles Lawrence, a member of Stephenson's team in 1861 who remained in Australia, and mainly recruited from the Harrow and Edenhope areas of the Wimmera region in western Victoria. Including outstanding cricketers such as Johnny Mullagh, the team played 47 matches, winning 14, drawing 19 and losing 14. In addition to cricket, the players demonstrated athletic prowess before after and during games, including throwing boomerangs and spears. The heavy workload and inclement weather took its toll with King Cole contracting a fatal case of tuberculosis during the tour. Further tours by English teams took place in 1873-74 (featuring the most notable cricketer of the age W.G. Grace) and 1876‚Äì77. The 1876-77 season was notable for a match between a combined XI from New South Wales and Victoria and the touring Englishmen at the Melbourne Cricket Ground played on 15‚Äì19 March. This match, later to be recognised as the first Test Match, was won by Australia by 45 runs thanks mainly to an unbeaten 165 by Charles Bannerman. The result of this match was seen by Australians and Englishmen as a reflection of the rising standard of Australian cricket. Origin of the Ashes and Sheffield Shield Billy Murdoch, who captained the Australia team during the first Ashes test in 1882 The rising standards of Australian cricket was further established during the first representative tour of England in 1878. While the Australians did not play a representative English team on this tour, the efforts of players such as Billy Murdoch, Fred Spofforth and Jack Blackham attracted much public interest. A return visit in 1878-79 is best remembered for a riot and by the time Australia visited England in 1880, playing the first Test in England at The Oval, a system of international tours was well established. A famous victory on the 1882 tour of England resulted in the placement of a satirical obituary in an English newspaper, The Sporting Times. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. The English media then dubbed the next English tour to Australia (1882‚Äì83) as the quest to regain The Ashes. The Sheffield Shield, the premier first-class cricket competition in Australia, was established in 1892 by the Australasian Cricket Council, the first attempt at a national cricket board. The Shield was purchased from funds donated by Lord Sheffield, the financier of the English tour of 1891‚Äì92. The council was formed with representation from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and with the aim of regulating intercolonial cricket and organising international tours. This last aim met resistance from the leading players of the day such as George Giffen. The players had previously run tours as a private enterprise, splitting profits amongst themselves and were unwilling to relinquish control of appointing a captain and team selection. Conflict between players and administrators would become a running theme in Australian cricket. Golden Age and the Great War The era from the mid-1890s to the World War I has been described as Australian cricket's golden age. This era saw the emergence of players such as Monty Noble, Clem Hill and in particular Victor Trumper, who was idolised by the Australian public. It also saw the continuing battle between the Melbourne Cricket Club and the players on one side with the state boards and the new Australian Board of Control on the other. The dispute was over the organisation of international tours and the revenue streams it created. It culminated in 1912 with the withdrawal of six leading players; Trumper, Hill, Warwick Armstrong, Vernon Ransford, Albert Cotter and Hanson \\"Sammy\\" Carter from the tri-nations series in England that year and a fistfight between Hill and his fellow selector Peter McAlister. The tour was unsuccessful and dogged by controversy. The Great War lead to the suspension of both international and Sheffield Shield cricket and the enlistment of many cricketers in the AIF. After the war, a team consisting of cricketers enlisted in the AIF toured the United Kingdom. The Australian Imperial Forces cricket team was strong, including cricketers such as Herbie Collins, Bert Oldfield and the all-rounder, Jack Gregory, all of whom would play a large part in the fortunes of the national team in the future. Between the wars: Bradman and Bodyline Bill Ponsford is one of only two cricket players to have scored 400 or more runs in a single first-class innings on more than one occasion. The other is Brian Lara of the West Indies. International cricket recommenced with a tour by a weakened England team in 1920‚Äì21. The strong Australian team, led by Armstrong and with a bowling attack spearheaded by Gregory and Ted McDonald won the series 5‚Äì0, the first time this was achieved in an Ashes series. The 1920s was an era of batting dominance. The Victorian opening batsman, Bill Ponsford was the chief destroyer of bowling attacks, scoring 429 against Tasmania in 1922-23 and topping that in 1927-28 with an innings against Queensland of 437. In between these innings, in 1926‚Äì27, his Victorian team made 1,107, the highest first class innings total to date. Ponsford's contribution was a mere 352. However, the greatest run machine in the history of Australian cricket was yet to come. Don Bradman, born in Cootamundra and raised in Bowral was 20 when he made his Test debut in the first Test of the 1928-29 series against England. He made 18 and 1 and was promptly dropped for the next Test. Recalled for the third Test in Melbourne, he scored 112 in the second innings to establish his place in the team for the next twenty years. During his illustrious career, he would hold the records for the highest individual Test innings and the most centuries in Test cricket and when he retired in 1948 he had the highest Test batting average, the last a record he still holds. He scored 117 first class centuries, still the only Australian to score a century of centuries and was knighted for services to cricket. Bodyline bowling in Brisbane, 1932 All that was still to come for Bradman when he toured England with the Australian team in 1930. Bradman scored heavily, 974 runs at an average of 139.14 including a then world record 334 at Leeds, two other double centuries and another single. Watching these displays of batting was Douglas Jardine, playing for Surrey. Following discussions with other observers such as Percy Fender and George Duckworth, he developed a tactic to limit the prodigious run scoring of Bradman and the others. The tactic, originally called fast leg theory and later called bodyline involved fast short pitched bowling directed at the batsman's body and a packed leg side field. Appointed captain of England for the 1932-33 series in Australia, Jardine was able to put these theories into practice. Combined with bowlers of the speed and accuracy of Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, the tactic required batsmen to risk injury in order to protect their wicket. In the third Test in Adelaide, Larwood struck Australian captain Bill Woodfull above the heart and fractured wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield's skull. The crowd was incensed and public feeling in Australia was high. A minor diplomatic incident ensued and for a time it appeared that cricketing relations between the two nations would be cut and the tour called off. Eventually diplomacy prevailed and the tour continued, England winning the series 4‚Äì1. The effect of bodyline can be seen by looking at Bradman's batting average, a respectable 56.57, the highest for Australia that series, but much lower than his Shield average of 150 over the same period. In December 1934, the Australian women's team played the English women in the first women's Test match at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. Despite a 7 wicket haul to Anne Palmer in the first innings, the English women were too strong and won by 9 wickets. Post War consolidation Once again, war brought a stop to Shield and Test cricket as Australia mobilised for World War II. Immediately after the end of the war in Europe in 1945, an Australian Services XI played a series of Victory Tests in England. The team was captained by Lindsay Hassett and it saw the emergence of the charismatic all-rounder Keith Miller. The series was drawn 2-2. After the retirement of Bradman in 1948, Hassett, Miller and all-rounder Ray Lindwall formed the nucleus of the Australian team. They were later joined by leg spinning all-rounder, Richie Benaud and batsman Neil Harvey. In 1951 Menzies enthusiasm for cricket, lead him to inaugurate the annual Prime Minister's XI cricket match in 1951 at Manuka Oval in Canberra. Robert Menzies favourite pastime or 'obsession' as some say was to watch and follow cricket. The first game was against the visiting international team the West Indies. Menzies was a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Club and knew many cricketers including Donald Bradman whom he declared was the 'undisputed master batsman of his time'. Menzies found cricket a useful diplomatic tool that Commonwealth nations had in common, as he stated that Great Britain and Australia were of the same blood, allegiance, history and instinctive mental processes.Hutchins, B:\\"Social-Conservatism, Australian Politics and Cricket: The Triumvirate of Prime Minister John Howard, Sir Robert Menzies and Sir Donald Bradman\\", Journal of Australian Studies, no.67, 2001. By the 1958-59 series, Benaud was captain of the Australian side and managed to recover the Ashes. The 1960-61 series at home against the West Indies was widely regarded as one of the most memorable. A commitment by Benaud and his West Indian offsider Frank Worrell to entertaining cricket revived lagging interest in the sport. The gripping series, including the first tied Test, saw Australia win 2-1 and become the inaugural holders of the newly commissioned Frank Worrell Trophy. The West Indian team was held in such affection that a ticker-tape parade in their honour prior to their departure from Australia attracted a crowd of 300,000 Melburnians to wish them farewell. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was an ongoing controversy regarding illegal bowling actions. A number of bowlers, Australian and international were accused of throwing or \\"chucking\\" over this period including the South Australian pair of Alan Hitchcox and Peter Trethewey and New South Welshman, Gordon Rorke. The controversy reached a high point when Ian Meckiff was recalled to the Australian team for the first Test of the 1963-64 series against South Africa. Called on to bowl his first over, he was no-balled 4 times by umpire Colin Egar for throwing before being removed from the attack by his skipper, Benaud. As a consequence, Meckiff retired from all levels of cricket after the match and Egar received death threats from persons aggrieved at his call. Rebel tours and revolution The 1970s saw players and administrators once again come into conflict. Poor scheduling saw Australia visit South Africa immediately after a tour to India in 1969‚Äì70. This would be the last tour to South Africa prior to the application of international sporting sanctions designed to oppose the policy of apartheid. The tired Australians came across a very strong South African team in conditions vastly different from the subcontinent, and were subsequently beaten 4‚Äì0. A request by the Australian Cricket Board for the players to play a further match in South Africa was met with resistance by the players, led by the captain, Bill Lawry. During the following home series against England, Lawry was sacked as captain and replaced by the South Australian batsman, Ian Chappell. Lawry remains the only Australian captain to be sacked in the middle of a Test series. Chappell, part of a younger and more assertive generation, saw the board's treatment of Lawry's as disgraceful and made a pledge to never allow himself to be placed in the same situation. Greg Chappell, Ian's younger brother, succeeded him as captain in 1975-76 and lead the Australian team in the Centenary Test in Melbourne in March 1977. A celebration of 100 years of Test cricket, Australia won the Test by 45 runs, the precise result of the corresponding game 100 years earlier. While Australian cricket celebrated, the Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer was making plans to wrest away the television rights for Australian cricket. During the 1977 Ashes tour, the cricket world became aware that Packer had signed 35 of the world's top cricketers for a series of matches, including 18 Australians, 13 of whom were part of the tour party. World Series Cricket, as the breakaway group was known split Australian cricket in two for nearly three years. Former Australian captain, Bob Simpson was recalled from retirement to lead an inexperienced team in a home series against India in 1977‚Äì78, won 3-2 and then a tour to the West Indies, marred by an ugly riot. For the 1978-79 Ashes series, he was replaced by the young Victorian, Graham Yallop. The subsequent thrashing, a 5-1 victory for England, and the success of World Series Cricket forced the Australian Cricket Board to concede on Packer's terms. The settlement between the ACB and WSC lead to the introduction of a series of innovations including night cricket, coloured clothing and an annual limited overs tri-series called the World Series Cup. It also signalled the return of the champion cricketers Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh. Their retirement at the end of the 1983-84 season was quickly followed by a series of tours to South Africa by a rebel Australian team in breach of the sporting sanctions imposed on the apartheid regime. The combined effect was to leave Australian cricket at its nadir under reluctant captain, Allan Border, losing Test series at home (2-1) and away (1-0) to New Zealand in 1985‚Äì86. Modern dominance Adam Gilchrist celebrating scoring a century against the World XI in the second ICC Super Series 2005 match at Telstra Dome (7 October 2005). The long road back for Australian cricket started in India in 1986‚Äì87. Border, along with Bob Simpson in a new role as coach, set out to identify a group of players that a team could form around. These players showed some of the steel necessary in the famous tied Test at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Returning to the subcontinent for the World Cup in 1987, Australia surprised the cricket world by defeating England at Eden Gardens in Kolkata to win the tournament with a disciplined brand of cricket. By the 1989 Ashes tour, the development of players such as Steve Waugh and David Boon and the discovery of Mark Taylor and Ian Healy had reaped rewards. The 4-0 drubbing of England was the first time since 1934 that Australia had recovered the Ashes away from home and marked the resurgence of Australia as a cricketing power. Australia would hold the Ashes for the next 16 years. The most successful leg spin bowler in the history of the game, Shane Warne, made his debut in 1991-92 in the third Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He had an undistinguished Test debut, taking 1/150 off 45 overs, and recording figures of 1/228 in his first Test series. From this modest beginning, Warne dominated Australian cricket for 15 years, taking 708 wickets at an average of 25.41. When the fast medium bowler, Glenn McGrath was first selected in the Australian team for the Perth test against New Zealand in 1993‚Äì94, the core of a highly successful bowling attack was formed. In 1994‚Äì95, under new captain Taylor, the Australians defeated the then dominant West Indies in the Caribbean to recover the Frank Worrell Trophy for the first time since 1978 and staked a claim to be considered the best team in the world. Following a disappointing World Cup at home in 1992, Australia then entered a run of extraordinarily successful World Cup campaigns; runners up to Sri Lanka in 1996 in the subcontinent, fighting back after early setbacks to win in England in 1999 and unbeaten on their way to another victory in South Africa. The change in captain from Taylor to Steve Waugh made little difference in the success of the Australian team. Waugh made a slightly rocky start to his term as captain, drawing 2-2 with the West Indies in the Caribbean and losing to Sri Lanka 1-0 away. A victory in the Australian team's first ever Test match against Zimbabwe was the start of an unparalleled 16 Test winning streak. The streak was finally ended in 2001 in Kolkata with a remarkable victory by India after being asked to follow-on. For Waugh, India would remain unconquered territory. A One day match at the MCG between Australia and India, 2004 Australia's success was not without its detractors. Accusations of racism were made against the Australian team, one incident leading to a suspension for Darren Lehmann in 2003. Contacts between Warne and batsman Mark Waugh and illegal bookmakers, at first kept under cover by the ACB, were later revealed by the Australian press, sparking accusations of hypocrisy given Australian cricket's earlier attitude toward match fixing allegations. Warne would later be suspended from all forms of cricket for 12 months after testing positive to banned diuretics hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. The brand of cricket played by the Australian team was praised for its spirit and aggressiveness but critics charged that this aggressive approach lead to ugly sledging incidents such as the confrontation between McGrath and West Indian batsman, Ramnaresh Sarwan at the Antigua Recreation Ground in 2003. Tasmanian batsman Ricky Ponting would admit to an alcohol problem after incidents in India and in Sydney. A rehabilitated Ponting would succeed Waugh as captain in 2004. While injured for most of the 2004-05 series against India, his team under acting captain Adam Gilchrist defeated India in India, the first Australian series win in India since Bill Lawry's team in 1969‚Äì70. A 2-1 defeat in the 2005 Ashes series in England was quickly avenged at home with a 5-0 thrashing of England in 2006-07. The whitewash was the first in an Ashes series since Warwick Armstrong's team in 1920‚Äì21. Following the series, the successful bowling combination of McGrath and Warne retired from Test cricket, with a record that will be hard to match as the Australian team endeavours to retain its place at the top of world cricket. Most recently Australia won the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the Caribbean and were unbeaten through the tournament. Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden scored the most runs in the tournament. The finals happened to be Glenn McGrath's last match and he was also the highest wicket taker of the tournament and the player of the tournament. The 2015 Cricket World Cup was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand from 14 February to 29 March 2015. Fourteen teams played 49 matches in 14 venues, with Australia staging 26 games at grounds in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Australia defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets to win their fifth ICC Cricket World Cup in front of a record crowd of 93,013. The winning captain Michael Clarke, retired from ODIs with immediate effect after the final match.

Summer and Golf were songwriter friends from the East Coast who each had an act in the coffeeshop's lineup. The three kept in touch throughout Summer and Jeremy's West Coast tour. When Summer went to music school in Chicago in 2006, she wrote some new material that she shared with Bauman. Bauman decided to start a label to put out her first full- length album based on this material. The album was called Timing and Lighting and was released in late 2008. Summer also released a 300-piece series of poster-size paintings to accompany the album, a collection she named The Girls. LossLess Records owns the rights to the painting series and, in a surprising move, Summer and LossLess Records chose to give away (via license) the entire series to fans along with a CD purchase.

Subtitled A New Rendering of the Watson Legend, it is a semi-fictional account of the life of Scottish-American Edgar \\"Bloody\\" Watson (1855‚Äì1910), a real Florida sugar cane planter and alleged outlaw who was killed by a posse of his neighbors in the remote Ten Thousand Islands region of southwest Florida. It won the National Book Award for Fiction in 2008 \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 2008\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-09. (With interview, acceptance speech by Matthiessen, and essay by Harold Augenbraum from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) and the William Dean Howells Medal in 2010. Contents Shadow Country is a reworked, re-edited, and retitled single-volume version of a trilogy published in the 1990s. The three parts of this book correspond to the three original novels: Killing Mr. Watson (1990), Lost Man's River (1997), and Bone By Bone (1999). Matthiesen's original intention was to produce a single long novel, but his publisher balked at the length of the manuscript and published it as three separate books. Matthiessen was not entirely satisfied with the resulting works and continued to refine his original manuscript off and on for the next several years. The eventual publication of Shadow Country involved substantial editing and culling: while the three separately published books together numbered some 1,300 pages, Shadow Country would number around 900. Most of the cuts came from Lost Man's River. The landing behind the Ted Smallwood Store in Chokoloskee, Florida, site of Edgar Watson's death in Shadow Country and in real life Book One is based on Killing Mr. Watson and is a collection of first-person narrative accounts of Edgar \\"Bloody\\" Watson's rise to power and eventual death at the hands of his neighbors. The book opens with Watson's death - his shooting by a local posse on the shores of Chokoloskee Island behind the Ted Smallwood Store. The rest of the book pieces together first-person accounts of 12 characters who recount the story from Watson's arrival in the Ten Thousand Islands in the early 1890s until his demise in 1910. Many of the \\"characters\\" who tell the story are based on real people who lived in the area at the time. Book Two is based on Lost Man's River. It is set several years after Book One, and it tells the story of Lucius, one of Watson's sons and an alcoholic historian, who tries to reconstruct his father's life in an attempt to determine whether he was really a murderer and an outlaw. It is written as a third person narrative. Book Three is based on Bone By Bone. In this first- person section, Edgar Watson tells his own life story, from his childhood in South Carolina to his fatal encounter with his neighbors on the edge of the Florida Everglades. By using this chronology, Matthiessen ends the book with the same scene in which it began told from opposite points of view. Reception Michael Dirda was one of many critics who lavished praise on the work: > Shadow Country is altogether gripping, shocking, and brilliantly told, not > just a tour de force in its stylistic range, but a \\"Great American Novel,\\" > as powerful a reading experience as nearly any in our literature. This > magnificent, sad masterpiece about race, history, and defeated dreams can > easily stand comparison with Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and Robert Penn > Warren's All the King's Men. Little wonder, too, that parts of the story of > E.J. Watson call up comparisons with Dostoevsky, Conrad, and, inevitably, > Faulkner. In every way, Shadow Country is a bravura performance, at once > history, fiction, and myth‚Äîas well as the capstone to the career of one of > the most admired and admirable writers of our time.Dirda, Michael \\"An Epic > of the Everglades\\", The New York Review of Books, May 15, 2008. Tom LeClair, reviewing the work for the New York Times, considered that the work failed to live up to the sum total of its originally published parts, stating: > By reducing his Watson materials to one volume, Matthiessen has sacrificed > qualities that gave those novels their powerful reinforcing illusions of > authenticity and artlessness. Book I still has that Ten Thousand Islands > quality, but \\"Shadow Country\\" as a whole is like the Tamiami Trail that > crosses the Everglades. It offers a quicker and easier passage through the > swamp, but fewer shades and shadows.

Friends, colleagues and admirers of the celebrated Canadian pianist Glenn Gould established the Foundation in 1983 after his death on October 4, 1982 at age 50. Its directors and supporters include many prominent Canadian and International cultural leaders and patrons, as well as Gould's personal friends. The Foundation encourages others to develop projects that celebrate Glenn Gould and the field of music and communications. In this way, the Foundation has been associated with numerous broadcasts, publications, exhibitions, and conferences in Canada and abroad. History The Glenn Gould Memorial Foundation, as it was called in the first couple of years, was established in October 1983 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to honor and perpetuate the memory of Glenn Gould. The foundation‚Äôs initial focus was on the explosion of worldwide interest in Gould‚Äôs life, work and ideas. The foundation‚Äôs earliest project was the creation of the Glenn Gould Prize, which was administered by the Canada Council for the Arts until 2000. The first major task was to raise money and establish an endowment large enough to support awarding the Glenn Gould Prize every three years. In 1985, the Foundation created the international Friends of Glenn Gould society and its two related publications, GlennGould, a semi-annual magazine and The Gould Standard, a quarterly newsletter. GlennGould published 13 volumes and ceased publication in Fall 2008. The Gould Standard is no longer published. The first symposium was held in Montreal in 1987. In 1992, the Foundation produced its first major international conference titled Music & Communication in the 21st Century: Variations on Themes of Glenn Gould, to mark the sixtieth birthday of Gould and the tenth anniversary of his death. Delegates and specialists from several countries met to carry forward Gould's ideas and investigations into the nature of music and its transmission. The five-day program covered themes that included Music as a Language of the 21st Century; Music and Creativity; The Technology of Future Musical Communication; and Music as an Instrument of Change in the 21st Century. Papers and records of the foundation, from its inception up to 1994 are held in the Library and Archives Canada, under the archival number MUS 236.http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/4/7/m15-348-e.html The Glenn Gould Gathering, held September 22‚Äì26, 1999 in Toronto, was a conference of delegates from 19 countries, and included a gala dinner celebrating Gould‚Äôs birthday; the presentation of the sixth Glenn Gould Prize to Yo-Yo Ma and the Glenn Gould Prot√©g√© Prize to Wu Man; and a nationally telecast unveiling of Gould's sculpture created by Ruth Abernethy. The Year of Glenn Gould ran from September 25, 2007 to September 24, 2008 and marked the 75th birthday of Glenn Gould, the 25th anniversary of his death, and ended with the 25th anniversary of the Foundation. It was celebrated worldwide with events throughout the year. U.S Foundation The Glenn Gould Foundation, Inc. was established in 2009 in the USA, with a parallel mission. Donations made to the Glenn Gould Foundation, Inc. receive a tax receipt in US dollars. Glenn Gould Prize Created by the Glenn Gould Foundation, the Glenn Gould Prize is an international lifetime achievement award in the arts and communications. It is awarded every three years to a living individual, in recognition of his/her contributions to music and communication. An international jury of distinguished musicians, journalists, arts patrons, and music aficionados selects the prize Laureate. Laureates receive a cash award of C$50,000 and are charged with selecting the recipient of the City of Toronto Glenn Gould Prot√©g√© Prize. A prize presentation ceremony and gala concert are held in Toronto in celebration. A portrait of each Laureate is added to a permanent collection of photographs, on display in the lower lobby of the Glenn Gould Studio at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto.

MEASURE Evaluation creates tools and approaches for rigorous evaluations, providing evidence to address health challenges, and strengthens health information systems so countries can make better decisions and sustain good health outcomes over time. MEASURE Evaluation is a cooperative agreement awarded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and five partner organizations: ICF International, John Snow Inc., Management Sciences for Health, Palladium, and Tulane University. This MEASURE Evaluation partnership provides technical leadership through collaboration at local, national, and global levels to build the sustainable capacity of developing nations to identify data needs, collect and analyze technically sound data, and use that data for health decision-making.  Purpose  MEASURE Evaluation works closely with USAID, its country missions and counterparts to improve collection, analysis and presentation of data to promote better use of data in planning, policy making, managing, monitoring, and evaluating population, health, and nutrition programs. The underlying premise is that improving the use of information in health sector decision making will lead to better health services, systems, and outcomes. The last few years have seen a dramatic increase in demand for high-quality health information through large global health initiatives that emphasize quantitative measures of progress to ensure accountability. These demands stretch weak and overburdened monitoring and evaluation (M&E;) and health information systems (HIS). There is an urgent need to strengthen the performance of HIS and M&E; systems at all levels, improve measurement in areas in which measurement methods are weak, increase evidence on the effectiveness of global health programs, and strengthen use of information beyond meeting reporting requirements to inform program decision making.  Monitoring and Evaluation  M&E; is the process by which data are collected and analyzed in order to provide information to policy makers and others for use in program planning and project management. Monitoring focuses on the implementation process and progress towards the achievement of program objectives. Evaluation measures how well the program activities have met expected objectives and/or the extent to which changes in outcomes can be attributed to the program.Frankel, N., & Gage, A. (rev. 2016) M&E; Fundamentals: A Self-Guided Minicourse. Chapel Hill, NC, USA, MEASURE Evaluation. https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/ms-07-20-en M&E; is important because it helps program implementers make informed decisions regarding program operations and service delivery based on objective evidence. It also ensures the most effective and efficient use of resources, helps determine the success or failure of a program, and assists in meeting organizational requirements such as reporting. Most importantly, monitoring and evaluation often convinces donors that their investments have been worthwhile. MEASURE Evaluation supports the international development goal of maximizing program results, by systematically collecting and analyzing information about and evidence on health program performance and impact. Evaluation findings support organizational learning, strengthen health systems, and improve program effectiveness so that people live healthier lives.  Health Information System Strengthening  Strong health information systems are a crucial element in overall health systems and, therefore, a critical factor in achieving better health for people. Health information systems provide essential information to enable all decision makers‚Äîfrom policy makers to health providers‚Äîto make evidence-informed choices for budgeting on health, health workforce needs, and services for citizens.World Health Organization (WHO). (2008). Health Information Systems. WHO. http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/toolkit_hss/EN_PDF_Toolkit_HSS_InformationSystems.pdf MEASURE Evaluation has worked in this arena for over 20 years, assisting countries in the systematic collection and analysis of evidence about health program performance and impact. MEASURE Evaluation‚Äôs Health Information Systems Strengthening Resource Center serves as a central hub for the exploration of what works to strengthen HIS, a repository for evidence about how strengthened health information systems improves health outcomes, and a learning space for health professionals to share and exchange information on strengthening health information systems. The project also develops tools and builds capacity in developing countries to strengthen electronic medical records, routine health information systems, and community-based health information systems. This involves developing data quality procedures; establishing guidelines for health data confidentiality, security, and ethics; improving data system interoperability; helping countries integrate data from disease surveillance and response systems, commodities and logistics management information systems, and civil registration and population health surveys; and promoting data demand and use. Other focal areas include gender, mhealth, and knowledge management.  MEASURE Evaluation's Work  Under optimum conditions, public health relies upon a network of facilities staffed with competent providers, a ready supply of essential medicines, and a governance structure supported by managers who understand the health issues of the population and are equipped to make good policy and program decisions based on evidence. MEASURE Evaluation works in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to strengthen health information systems. Specific populations addressed by the project include orphans and vulnerable children, adolescents, and key populations at risk of HIV. The project applies research expertise and provides technical assistance to developing countries in data ethics, data science, network analysis, data quality, geospatial analysis, health informatics, secondary data analysis, digital data collection, statistical sampling, and systems thinking. It conducts studies using a range of research methods: rigorous evaluation (outcome, impact, economic, and process evaluations), complexity-aware methods, mixed-methods studies, surveys, modeling, and most significant change. MEASURE Evaluation researches health system performance; builds human capacity; and supports public health practitioners and policy makers to use data to perform these six essential functions of a health information system: 1\\\\. Monitor trends in health outcomes and services. 2\\\\. Ensure that data are trustworthy. 3\\\\. Make decisions quickly and efficiently. 4\\\\. Identify what works. 5\\\\. Ensure the coordination and equity of health services. 6\\\\. Manage resources for the greatest benefit.  Where MEASURE Evaluation Works  MEASURE Evaluation works in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and Eurasia, implementing research and building capacity for rigorous evaluation and health information system strengthening in about 40 countries at any one time.  Earlier Phases  MEASURE Evaluation is now in Phase IV. Phase I (1998‚Äì2003) focused on data analysis and the design of new tools. Phase II (2004‚Äì2009) included data demand and utilization (now Data Demand and Use), training and capacity building, collaboration and coordination, and research and development. Phase III added knowledge management and organization development. Phase IV strengthened the project's dual focus on evaluation and health information system strengthening.  Monitor  Monitor is a monthly update sent via email detailing all new developments at MEASURE Evaluation. Currently, this newsletter reaches about 13,000 people worldwide.

Biography The group was founded in 1991 by Matt Adams, Niki Jewett, Will Kittow and Ju Row Farr. The group is currently led by Matt Adams, Ju Row Farr and Nick Tandavanitj. Other members include the film maker John Hardwick and performer Jamie Iddon. Over its history, Blast Theory's work has explored interactivity and the social and political aspects of technology through a multitude of forms ‚Äì using performance, installation, video, mobile and online technologies. Currently based at their studios in Portslade, Blast Theory tours nationally and internationally, working with a number of Associate Artists on different projects. The group has collaborated with The University of Nottingham's Mixed Reality Lab since 1998. Works created collaboratively with the MRL include Desert Rain (1999), Can You See Me Now? (2001) and Rider Spoke (2007). Blast Theory's work has been shown at NTT InterCommunication Center (ICC) in Tokyo, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney Biennale, National Museum in Taiwan, Hebbel Theater in Berlin, Basel Art Fair, Dutch Electronic Arts Festival, S√≥nar Festival in Barcelona, and Palestine International Video Festival.SonarM√°tica Recent commissions include You Get Me (2008) at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, for Deloitte Ignite '08, and Ulrike and Eamon Compliant (2009) for the De La Warr Pavilion at the 53rd Venice Biennale.

With early works such as Gunmen Kill Three (1991) and Chemical Wedding (1994) fitting more in the category of live and performance art, Desert Rain (1999) saw a shift towards work that aims to question performativity, site and presence. Works such as Can You See Me Now? (2001), a game of chase through real and virtual city streets, have seen Blast Theory mix video games and performance, with Can You See Me Now? and You Get Me (2008) being open to a worldwide audience via the internet.

Since 2006, the band has released five albums and one EP, including several collaborations with Mike Viola. History Porter Block formed in the early 2000s. Peter Block met Caleb Sherman in 2003 while playing in the band Tripasaurus vs. Blockhead. During recording sessions at the Engine Room Audio in New York City, Block and Sherman formed Porter Block. The group‚Äôs influences drew from 1960s British Invasion bands to ‚Äò70s acts such as Neil Young and The Eagles. Porter Block‚Äôs debut album, Suburban Sprawl, was released in 2006 by Engine Room Recordings, a label founded by Block and Engine Room Audio owner Mark Christensen. All Music Guide wrote, \\"Buoyant pop tunes filled with harmonies and hooks ‚Ä¶ a promising start.\\" In 2007, the band released the Solitary Hotel EP and contributed two songs to the first volume of the Guilt By Association covers compilation series. In 2008, Porter Block released their second full-length album, Off Our Shoulders. PopMatters called it \\"a pleasantly infectious 36-minute spread of over 10 catchy pop missives that wash over you like a cool summer breeze without ever outstaying their welcome.\\" The band‚Äôs third full-length, Pueblo A Go Go, was released in February 2009. It was self-produced by Block, with Sherman adding performance and mixing credits. Steve Holley, whose resume includes Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Ian Hunter‚Äôs Rant Band, guested on drums. Guitarist Garrett Alarcon lent a hand both in the studio and on the live dates that followed with Mike Doughty. Touring partners from 2006 to 2009 included Deep Blue Something, Mike Viola, The Samples, and Mike Doughty. When Sherman moved his studio to Nashville in 2009, Block reached out to 11 songwriters he admired, some he had never met, and invited them to his studio near the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The songwriting group included Terry Radigan, Casey Shea, Jeff Jacobson, and Angela McCluskey. The resulting album was called The Gowanus Yacht Club, released August 2009. Short And Sweet NYC called it, \\"A fine blend of well- crafted songs that is a summation of a rather interesting songwriting ‚Äòexperiment‚Äô.\\" In 2010, Porter Block released Peter Block, a solo-centric album dealing with subjects of illness and divorce. Mike Viola produced, played on and co-wrote the album, which also featured collaborations with Tracy Bonham, Dan Miller of They Might Be Giants, Michael Flynn of Slow Runner, and Aaron Lee Tasjan. Edge Media remarked, \\"Want something that will have you bobbing your head instantly? Peter Block‚Äôs self-titled fifth album will do it for you.\\" In April 2010, Peter was diagnosed with a neurological viral condition called Parsonage-Turner Syndrome, which partially-paralyzed his arms and hands. After recovering, Block helped create the non-profit Music and Medicine Program at Weill Cornell Medical College, which encourages its students to continue pursuing music courses and performance while studying medicine. Porter Block will release a new LP, Hard To See Beautiful, on August 8, 2016. Sherman‚Äôs credits include co-producer, co-writer, vocalist and player. Mike Viola contributed as co-producer, co-writer, acoustic guitarist and backup vocalist on three songs. Hard To See Beautiful was recorded digitally at Sherman‚Äôs Cygnus Sound studio in Nashville, Tennessee and analog at The Carriage House in Los Angeles, by studio owner/ace engineer and producer, Sheldon Gomberg (Ben Harper, Warpaint, Joseph Arthur). Guitars were performed by Block, Sherman, Viola, Steven Elliot (Dawes, Norah Jones) and Terry Radigan. Keyboard duties were split between Block, Sherman, and Larry Goldings (James Taylor, John Mayer). Drums were done by Brandon Barnes and longtime Elvis Costello collaborator, Pete Thomas. Bass tracks were handled by Sherman and another Costello bandmate, Davey Faragher. A song recorded during the Hard To See Beautiful sessions, a cover of The Kinks‚Äô ‚ÄúDead End Street,‚Äù was released in July 2016. Hard To See Beautiful will be released by Team Mensch, a brand new label started by Peter and fellow music enthusiast, Darren Paltrowitz. Tour dates in support of the album will be performed alongside Lucy Woodward and Tim Easton.

Although the R.II was the first of the batch to be completed, it was the last accepted into military service, and then only as a trainer. The Siemens-Schuckert R.II to R.VII were ordered in the G (Grossflugzeug - large aircraft) series and given serial numbers G.32/15 to G.37/15 respectively. These serials were changed on 13 July 1915 to G.33/15 - G.38/15, for unknown reasons and again on 6 November 1915 to R.2/15 - R.7/15 in the R (Riesenflugzeug - giant aircraft) series, adopting the R.II to R.VII designations.Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.184 Design and development As designed, the R.II was a large three-bay biplane with unstaggered wings of unequal spanHaddow & Grosz 1963, p.181 and a fully enclosed cabin. Power was to be supplied by three 180-kW (240-hp) Maybach HS engines mounted internally in the fuselage, which transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage.Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.174 The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried dual wheels, and the tail was supported by a pair of tailwheels.Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.185 The fuselage was forked into an upper and lower section, which allowed a clear field of fire to the rear of the aircraft. The R.II first flew on 26 October 1915 and was delivered to the military on 20 November.Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.186 The Maybach engines proved immediately troublesome, prone to overheating and mechanical failure. In February 1916, the engines were removed and returned to the manufacturer. Ongoing trouble with the same engine in other aircraft eventually led Siemens-Schuckert to abandon work with these engines entirelyHaddow & Grosz 1963, p.182 and in June, the firm asked the Idflieg whether to install Benz Bz.IV or Mercedes D.IVa in the R.II instead. By the time that the Idflieg approved the Mercedes engine for installation, Siemens- Schuckert did not have the workforce available to install them, and placed the R.II in storage instead. While the R.II was in storage, the Idflieg changed its requirements for the aircraft, requesting that the operational altitude be increased from , but hoping that even more altitude would be possible. Siemens-Schuckert responded that this would not be possible with the Mercedes engines recently approved for installation, and suggested three Benz D.IV engines inside the fuselage, augmented by two more of the same engine mounted pusher-fashion in the interplane gap. The Idflieg rejected this suggestion, insisting on the basic requirement of having the engines serviceable in flight. By the time that workers were available for the R.II again, in early 1917, Siemens-Schuckert had gained experience with the similar R.VII and attempted to meet the Idflieg's requirements by installing extra sections in the wing to extend it to six bays and thereby offset the extra weight of the new engines. The upper wings were replaced with a new design with greater chord, and the tail surfaces were enlarged. Finally, bomb racks were fitted to the wings that could carry either six 50-kg bombs or four 100-kg bombs.Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.186‚Äì87 During its acceptance flight, the newly refurbished R.II carried a 2,310-kg (5,100-lb) useful load to an altitude of and stayed aloft for four hours. Having satisfied requirements, R.II was delivered to Riesenflugzeugersatzabteilung (Rea ‚Äî \\"giant aircraft support unit\\"), the support unit for R-type aircraft, on 29 June 1917. Although the R.II's performance was a significant improvement over other R-type aircraft produced by Siemens-Schuckert, its increased span and weight limited its speed, and it could not keep pace with similar aircraft manufactured by Staaken then entering service. The R.II was therefore relegated to training duties with the Riesenflugzeug Schulabteilung (\\"giant aircraft training unit\\") at D√∂beritz. In June 1918, it was transferred back to Rea at Cologne, where it crashed later that year.

The R.III was delivered to D√∂beritz for military service on 30 December 1915. Problems with the engines began almost immediately, and numerous modifications to the engines and their cooling systems were carried out in the field. Despite the modifications, engine problems were probably responsible when the R.III crashed in early 1916. New wings were fitted to the aircraft to replace those damaged in the crash, but further attempts to fly the R.III were again hampered by its engines, and the aircraft was returned to Siemens-Schuckert. In June, the firm requested permission from the Idflieg to replace the troublesome engines with Benz Bz.IV engines, but was told to place the R.III in storage instead. Work on the R.III commenced again in October 1916, when a number of improvements based on field experience with the R.V and R.VI were incorporated into the aircraft. These included: reinforcement of the tail, engine and gearbox thermometers, lighting in the engine room, and covers for the radiators that could be extended in flight. The wing was extended both in span and in chord. By this time, the Idflieg had relaxed its specifications for the R-types ordered from Siemens-Schuckert,Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.192 and with the Benz engines fitted, the R.III was able to meet the lowered standard. Siemens-Schuckert delivered the refurbished aircraft to Riesenflugzeugersatzabteilung (Rea ‚Äî \\"giant aircraft support unit\\") on 12 December 1916 and it was accepted into service on 21 December. In its modified form, the aircraft was of no use on the front line, but was used for training instead, a role in which it was still serving in February 1918. The Siemens- Schuckert R.II to R.VII were ordered in the G (Grossflugzeug - large aircraft) series and given serial numbers G.32/15 to G.37/15 respectively. These serials were changed on 13 July 1915 to G.33/15 - G.38/15, for unknown reasons and again on 6 November 1915 to R.2/15 - R.7/15 in the R (Riesenflugzeug - giant aircraft) series, adopting the R.II to R.VII designations.Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.184 SpecificationsNotesReferences  * 1910s German bomber aircraft R.III Three-engined twin-prop tractor aircraft Biplanes Aircraft first flown in 1915 ","title":"Siemens-Schuckert R.III"},{"id":"23717542","text":"The Siemens-Schuckert R.IV was a bomber aircraft built in Germany during World War I.Taylor 1989, p.808The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft, p.2920 It was one of six aircraft based on the Siemens-Schuckert R.I that were originally intended to be identical, but which each developed in a different direction and were designated as different aircraft types by the German Inspectorate of Flying Troops (the Idflieg).Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.184 The Maybach HS engines specified by the Idflieg proved unreliable, but with these engines were replaced by Benz Bz.IV engines, the R.IV saw service on the Eastern Front before being relegated to training duties.

The fuselage was forked into an upper and lower section, which allowed a clear field of fire to the rear of the aircraft. Siemens-Shuckert delivered the R.IV to the German military on 29 January 1916, and trouble with the engines began almost immediately. Shortly after test flights commenced, it was necessary to replace the original HS engines with new ones. While the engines were being replaced, a number of other modifications were carried out, including replacing the original nose-mounted radiators with aerofoil-shaped radiators fitted in the upper wingHaddow & Grosz 1963, p.181 and adding new gravity-fed fuel tanks. With these improvements in place, the R.IV flew again in May 1916. Even then, the engines overheated until one of the cylinders turned blue. Siemens- Shuckert engineers believed that with still larger radiators, the Maybach engines could be made to work on this aircraft. However, the firm lacked the personnel and the experience to undertake engine development.Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.182 Therefore, while Siemens-Schuckert asked the Idflieg to allow them to substitute Benz Bz.IV engines on the R.IIHaddow & Grosz 1963, p.186 and R.IIIHaddow & Grosz 1963, p.187 the firm suggested that the Idflieg accept the R.IV in its current state, including its Maybach engines, so that they could oversee a development programme for the engine themselves. The Idflieg agreed to this suggestion and lowered its specifications for the R.IV accordingly. The R.IV passed the new requirements on an acceptance flight on 27 August 1916, and was accepted into service with the Riesenflugzeugersatzabteilung (Rea ‚Äî \\"giant aircraft support unit\\") the same day. Within a few months, the R.IV's wings had been extended by adding an extra bay to them and in November 1916, the Maybach engines were finally replaced by Benz Bz.IV engines, probably while the R.IV was being repaired after a crash. Before the aircraft flew with its new engines, a fifth bay was added to the wings. All work was completed by 14 February 1917, and the refurbished aircraft flew on 14 March. The R.IV was assigned to Riesenflugzeugabteilung 501 (Rfa 501) at Vilna on 27 April 1917. It was used operationally until Rfa 501 was redeployed to the Western Front, at which point it was left behind in Vilna for use as a trainer with the Riesenflugzeug Schulabteilung (\\"giant aircraft training unit\\").Haddow & Grosz 1963, p.25 The R.IV continued in this role at Vilna until early 1918, when it was withdrawn to Berlin.

They were voted in during the French Second Republic and promulgated on 15 March 1850 and in 1851, following the presidential election of Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte as president in December 1848 and the May 1849 legislative elections that gave a majority to the conservative Parti de l'Ordre. Named for the Minister of Education Alfred de Falloux, they mainly aimed at promoting Catholic teaching. The Falloux Law of 15 March 1850 also extended the requirements of the Guizot Law of 1833, which had mandated a boys' school in each commune of more than 500 inhabitants, to require a girls' school in those communes. The 1851 law created a mixed system, in which some primary education establishments were public and controlled by the state and others were under the supervision of Catholic congregations (teaching orders). The new law opened an era of cooperation between Church and state that lasted until the anticlerical Ferry laws ended this in the early 1880s. The Falloux laws provided universal primary schooling in France and expanded opportunities for secondary schooling. In practice, the curricula in Catholic and state schools were similar. Catholic schools were especially useful in schooling for girls, which had long been neglected.Patrick J. Harrigan, \\"Church, State, and Education in France From the Falloux to the Ferry Laws: A Reassessment,\\" Canadian Journal of History, (2001) 36#1 pp 51-83  Main features  The main objectives of the Falloux Laws was to replace the revolutionary and imperial system, which had placed the whole of the education system under the supervision of the University and of state-trained teachers, who were accused of spreading Republicans and anti- clerical ideas, by a system giving responsibility for education back to the clergy. This aim was largely achieved: the Falloux Law created a mixed system, public (and mostly secular) on one hand, and private and Catholic on the other. This law allowed the clergy and members of ecclesiastical orders, male and female, to teach without any further qualifications. This exemption was extended even to priests who taught in secondary schools, where a university degree was demanded from lay teachers. The primary schools were put under the management of the cur√©s. The Falloux Law created one academy for each department, decentralising the University and thus strengthening the notables' local influence. It reorganised the Superior Council of Education and academic councils, specifically by giving a large number of places to representatives of various religions, above all of Roman Catholicism. Eight University members had seats at the Superior Council of Public Instruction, alongside seven religious representatives (including four Catholics), three state counsellors, three members of the Institute, and three members representing \\"free\\" (i.e. private) teaching establishments. Similarly, bishops were included in the academic councils. Primary and secondary education were divided between state establishments, and private establishments, headed by non-profit organisations or religious congregations. Supervision of schools was the joint responsibility of the mayor and the priest. The law more strictly regulated teacher training colleges (√©coles normales) and teachers were provided with a guaranteed minimum wage. Any town could transfer its public coll√®ge to the Catholic system. All schools were inspected by government officials and the state alone had the right to award the baccalaur√©at. The law worked as intended to increase the Catholic role. The growth in Catholic schools 1854 to 1867 was 75 percent, as opposed to 34 percent for the secondary school system as a whole. Gino Raymond, Historical Dictionary of France (2008) p 128.  Historical and political background  Alfred de Falloux. The Falloux Law was promulgated in a context in which French Catholics were worried about the increasing role of the state in education since the Revolution of 1789 and the reorganisation of the imperial University. They thought that the imperial education system, inherited from the First Empire's reforms, excessively diffused Enlightenment, republican and socialist ideas.Pierre Albertini, L'√âcole en France., p. 47-48 Thus, they wanted the education system to return to its basis during the Ancien R√©gime. The Bourbon Restoration had in part satisfied these wants, by tolerating teaching by religious congregations, although it still theoretically remained prohibited, and had also granted more weight to bishops in the education system, enabling schooling programs to give more attention to Catholicism. However, the July Monarchy was much less friendly to this reactionary trend. Although the Guizot Law of 1833 partially satisfied Catholics by authorising private teaching in primary education, it kept secondary and higher education under the University's supervision. Guizot also generalised the √©coles normales primaires, which were responsible for the training of teachers. First created by the National Convention in 1794, these schools, related to the √©coles normales sup√©rieures, were organised on the basis of the 1808 decree organising the University of France, and were accused by conservatives of promoting Republicanism, Socialism and anti-clericalism.  First debates during 1848-1849  After the 1848 Revolution, Lazare Hippolyte Carnot was named Minister of Public Instruction and prepared a draft reform. He named the Republican Jules Barth√©lemy-Saint-Hilaire president of the parliamentary commission which would write the draft.James Guillaume, Falloux entry in the Nouveau dictionnaire de p√©dagogie (dir. Ferdinand Buisson), 1911. The latter would have made education mandatory for children of both sexes, as well as a three years of training for teachers, subsidied by the state. Although it favoured public schools, it still allowed private teaching establishments.In√®s Murat, La IIe R√©publique, Paris, Fayard, 1987, p.198-200 Carnot's draft was however set aside after his resignation on 5 July 1848.In√®s Murat, La IIe R√©publique, Paris, Fayard, 1987, p.290 Thus, parliamentary debates were resumed. The newly elected President Louis Napol√©on Bonaparte replaced Carnot with Alfred de Falloux as Minister of Public Instruction in December 1848, the latter remaining in Odilon Barrot's government until May 1849. The decree of 11 December 1848 made the upcoming law on education an organic law, which should thus be reserved to the Constituent Assembly's initiative. A Legitimist (i.e. a conservative Royalist), Falloux officially withdrew Carnot's draft bill on 4 January 1849 and dissolved the Scientific and Literary Study Commission named by Carnot. Falloux clearly aimed at restoring Roman Catholicism to the forefront of French schooling and society, describing his program in his Memoirs: \\"God in education. The Pope at the head of the Church. The Church at the head of civilisation.\\" Having dissolved Carnot's commission, Falloux created two new ministerial commissions, dedicated to preparing the draft laws for primary and secondary education, which quickly merged. Both were composed by a majority of conservative Catholics. Presided by the Minister Falloux himself, it had as vice-president Adolphe Thiers, and included Catholics such as the archbishop of Paris Mgr Sibour, the abbot Dupanloup (who later became bishop of Orl√©ans), etc. Surprisingly, Thiers, formerly a critic of the Church's involvement in education, was one of those who most supported Catholics' influence in the education system, being ready to hand over to the clergy the whole of the primary education establishments, whilst bishop Dupanloup and others strong Catholics calmed his excessive claims. Upset by this measure, in part because the December 1848 decree had given the initiative for the legislative process, concerning organic laws, to the Assembly, the latter nominated a new parliamentary Commission to re-establish its prerogatives following a proposition by the moderate Republican Pascal Duprat. This parallel Commission was presided by the Minister of Public Instruction de Vaulabelle and had as secretary the Republican Jules Simon. Parliamentary debates focused on Article 9 of the new Constitution concerning education. Catholic deputy Charles de Montalembert then described the University's monopoly in the education system as \\"intellectual communism\\" and claimed the system was \\"inferior to that of the Ancien R√©gime\\".Les constitutions de la France pr√©sent√©es par Jacques Godechot, p. 259-260. Article 9 proclaimed that \\"education is free\\" (\\"L'enseignement est libre\\")\\" while adding that this \\"freedom of education\\" was determined by legislation and exercised \\"under state supervision.\\" While authorising private establishments, this article thus ensured that education in general was placed under the watch of the state. The extent of the latter would be determined by forthcoming laws. On 5 February 1849, Jules Simon presented to the Assembly the draft law, composed of 23 articles. However, Odilon Barrot's government claimed that the Constituent Assembly's mandate was coming to an end, and that further proposed laws would have to be examined by the succeeding National Assembly. Pressed for time, the Constituent Assembly thus decided to examine the most pressing laws. Deputy Boub√©e, a scientist and University lecturer, proposed that the draft education law be one of those scrutinised, but his motion was rejected by 458 votes against 307.  New debates following the May 1849 elections  Discussion of the new law would thus have to wait the May 1849 legislative election. But these ones gave an absolute majority to the conservative Parti de l'Ordre, mainly composed of Catholic monarchists, whether Orleanists or Legitimists, such as Falloux who was elected deputy. Despite having been dissolved, the Commission presided by Barth√©l√©my Saint-Hilaire and named by Carnot submitted its draft and report to the Assembly on 10 April 1849. This work was ignored during further discussions. On 18 June 1849, Falloux submitted to the Assembly the draft bill elaborated by the ministerial commission which he had himself named. Falloux thus resumed his plans: \\"Instruction has remained too much isolated from education; education has remained too much isolated from religion.\\" The Assembly hereby named another parliamentary commission, where Catholics had again the upper-hand. It included Salomon (from the Meuse), the Protestant theologian Coquerel, Baze, the theologian Armand de Melun (who had been a collaborator of late Denys Affre, former archbishop of Paris), de l'Espinay, Sauvaire-Barth√©lemy (a grandnephew of the marquis de Barth√©l√©my), Dufougeray, Barth√©l√©my Saint-Hilaire, de Montalembert, Rouher, Thiers, Beugnot, Fresneau, Janvier, Parisis (bishop of Langres). The Commission chose Thiers as president and Beugnot as \\"rapporteur\\" (in charge of presenting the draft bill to the Assembly). Falloux also managed to bypass the Conseil d'Etat's examination of the law, the latter being composed of several Republicans. In September 1849, Falloux fell sick, and was replaced in October as Minister of Public Instruction by F√©lix Esquirou de Parieu. On 11 January 1850, a minor law (named Parieu Law) was passed, simplifying procedures of suspension and revocation of teachers. The draft was discussed again starting on 14 January 1850. During these debates, Victor Hugo, although member of the Parti de l'Ordre, criticised the renewed influence of the clergy. The law was finally adopted on 15 March 1850, by 399 votes against 237.I. Murat, La Deuxi√®me R√©publique, op.cit. p. 423-424.  Reforms of the Third Republic and after  The Third Republic abrogated or reformed most dispositions of the Falloux Laws. The 27 February 1880 law reduced the clergy's representation in educational councils. The Ferry Laws established mandatory, free and laic education. The Goblet Law abrogated the first and second section of the Falloux Law. In 1904, among increasing voices to repeal entirely the Falloux Law, the Minister Emile Combes prohibited religious congregations from teaching, including in private schools. However, Catholics responded by creating \\"lay private schools\\", where religious education was maintained, although teaching was done by lay people, and not clergy. The Vichy Regime allowed again religious congregations to teach and strongly subsided private Catholic schools. Although these subsidies were interrupted following the Liberation, the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) did not repeal the teaching authorisation given to congregations. The Debr√© Law of 1959 went further, by having private schools' teachers paid by the state. Although the Falloux Laws have formally been repealed since the promulgation of the Education Code in 2000, several of their dispositions have been retained in the Code, and form the main legislative framework for private schools.

The Larry Craig scandal was an incident that began on June 11, 2007, with the arrest of Craig, who at the time was a Republican United States Senator from Idaho, for lewd conduct in a men's restroom at the Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul International Airport. Craig later entered a guilty plea to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct on August 8. As a result of the controversy surrounding his arrest, subsequent guilty plea, and pressure from his fellow Republicans, Craig announced his intention to resign from the Senate at a news conference on September 1, which was to become effective on September 30. After Craig's efforts to withdraw his guilty plea failed, on October 4, he released a statement refusing to resign from the Senate. Craig did not run for re-election in 2008, and the incident effectively ended his political career. Arrest thumb On June 11, 2007, Craig was arrested at the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Airport on suspicion of disorderly conduct. The nature of the alleged activity has been categorized by some as cottaging. According to the police report, the police officer sat in a bathroom stall as part of an undercover operation investigating complaints of sexual activity in the restroom. After about 13 minutes of sitting in the stall, the police officer observed Craig lingering outside and frequently peeking through the crack of the door on the stall. Craig then entered the stall to the left of the officer's stall. The police officer made the following observations, which he recorded in his report of the incident, as to what happened next: > At 1216 hours, Craig tapped his right foot. I recognized this as a signal > used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct. Craig tapped his toes > several times and moves his foot closer to my foot. ... The presence of > others did not seem to deter Craig as he moved his right foot so that it > touched the side of my left foot which was within my stall area. Craig then > proceeded to swipe his left hand under the stall divider several times, with > the palm of his hand facing upward. According to the incident report and criminal complaint filed in court, the officer showed Craig his police identification beneath the partition separating their stalls, and the officer then pointed his finger towards the restroom exit. Craig initially said no, but he ultimately complied with the officer's request to leave the restroom. After Craig and the officer left the restroom, Craig was reluctant to go with the officer and demanded the officer show his police identification a second time. Once the officer complied with the request, Craig, the arresting officer, and a police detective, who was stationed outside of the restroom, went to the airport police station. After the arresting officer read Craig his Miranda rights, the officer interviewed Craig about the restroom incident. At one point, Craig handed his business card to the arresting officer, which identified him as a U.S. Senator, and said to him, \\"What do you think about that?\\" Craig told the officer that he was worried about missing his flight, and the arresting officer asked the police detective to call the airline to hold the flight. The detective reported that no one answered the telephone for the airline, and the arresting officer proceeded with the interview. According to the arrest report prepared by Sgt. Dave Karsnia, \\"Craig stated ... He has a wide stance when going to the bathroom and that his foot may have touched mine.\\" Craig never used the term \\"wide stance\\" himself. According to the transcript of the police interrogation, Sgt. Karsnia asked: \\"Did you do anything with your feet?\\" and Craig replied: \\"Positioned them, I don't know. I don't know at the time. I'm a fairly wide guy.\\" When the officer asked Craig about the use of his hands, Craig said that he reached down with his right hand to pick up a piece of paper that was on the floor. The officer disputed Craig's version by saying, \\"there was not a piece of paper on the bathroom floor, nor did Craig pick up a piece of paper.\\" Craig also disputed the officer's assertion about the position of his hand, claiming that his right palm was faced down as he picked up the paper from the floor. The officer disputed Craig's version, alleging that Craig used his left hand because his thumb, \\"was positioned in a faceward motion.\\" During the interview and in the incident report, the officer commented that Craig either disagreed with what happened in the restroom or could not recall the events as they happened. Craig returned to the airport on June 22 to complain about how he had been treated by the police. According to the police report about Craig's return, Craig said he wanted information for his lawyer. Craig pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct by signing and mailing a plea petition, dated August 1, 2007, to the Hennepin County District Court in Minnesota. He paid $575, including fines and fees. Senator Craig signed the petition to enter his guilty plea, which contained the provisions, \\"I understand that the court will not accept a plea of guilty from anyone who claims to be innocent ... I now make no claim that I am innocent of the charge to which I am entering a plea of guilty.\\" Craig mailed his signed petition to the court, and his petition to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge was accepted and filed by the court on August 8, 2007. Allegations about prior conduct become public On October 17, 2006, gay rights activist Michael Rogers reported on sexual liaisons between U.S. Senator Larry Craig and unnamed individuals in Washington, DC's Union Station. Rogers uncovered a news story from 1982 that tied Craig to a sex and drug scandal in the US Congress. Rogers reported on more recent activity in various places throughout the nation. Rogers's report prompted Craig to issue a denial. On August 27, 2007, Roll Call broke the story to reveal details about Craig's arrest at the Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul Airport and his subsequent guilty plea in that case. After the conviction came to light, the Idaho Statesman published a story on August 28, 2007, about three allegations involving Craig's sexual conduct. A college student, who was considering pledging at Craig's fraternity at the University of Idaho in 1967, told a reporter for the Idaho Statesman that Craig led the student to his bedroom and, \\"made what the man said he took to be an invitation to sex.\\" In the second reported incident, a man, who identified himself as gay, told a reporter that Craig cruised him at the REI store in Boise in November 1994, following him around the store for half an hour. The last reported incident to the Idaho Statesman about Craig's conduct came from a 40-year-old man with close ties to Republican officials. According to the man's story about the encounter with Craig, the man \\"reported having oral sex with Craig at Washington's Union Station, probably in 2004.\\" A reporter for the Idaho Statesman interviewed Craig on August 28, 2007, regarding the allegations about his conduct, and in response to the reporter's questions, Craig said, \\"I'm not gay, and I don't cruise, and I don't hit on men. ... I don't go around anywhere hitting on men, and by God, if I did, I wouldn't do it in Boise, Idaho! Jiminy!\\" Responses to the arrest Craig told the public that the officer misconstrued his actions, that he was not involved in any inappropriate conduct, and had failed to seek legal counsel: \\"In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously.\\" In an August 28, 2007, press conference in Boise, Idaho, Craig said: > I am not gay. I never have been gay. ... In June, I overreacted and made a > poor decision. I chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in hopes of making > it go away. ... Please let me apologize to my family, friends and staff and > fellow Idahoans for the cloud placed over Idaho. I did nothing wrong at the > Minneapolis airport. I did nothing wrong, and I regret the decision to plead > guilty and the sadness that decision has brought on my wife, on my family, > friends, staff and fellow Idahoans. Craig's arrest provoked a small flurry of attention to that earlier scandal, and it was suggested that Craig had absorbed a lesson from it: \\"sexual misconduct‚Äîor even the mere perception that one is gay‚Äîcould ruin a man's reputation. But steadfast, straight-in-the-eye denial just might get him off the hook.\\" Craig claimed that his state of mind was troubled at the time of the guilty plea because he and his family \\"[had] been relentlessly and viciously harassed\\" by the Idaho Statesman in the course of its investigation into allegations of Craig's homosexuality. On August 30, the Statesman called for Craig's resignation. In response to questions about the arrest, the Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul Airport Police Department released an audiotape of Craig's interview with Sergeant Dave Karsnia, the arresting officer. In that interview, Craig denied wrongdoing and claimed that he was a victim of entrapment. Craig was one of two Senate liaisons for Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, but removed himself from that campaign role after the conviction became public. Romney said of Craig, \\"He's disappointed the American people.\\" Craig later expressed bitterness about Romney's handling of the incident, saying in an interview with Matt Lauer, \\"And [Romney] not only threw me under his campaign bus, he backed up and ran over me again.\\" A Washington watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee requesting an investigation into whether Craig violated Senate Rules of Conduct. Members of the Republican Party in Congress began calling for Craig to resign, including Representative Pete Hoekstra (MI), Senator John McCain (AZ), Senator Norm Coleman (MN) and Senator John Ensign (NV). Coleman and Senator Susan Collins (ME) announced that they would donate campaign contributions received from Craig's political action committee to charity. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and sitting chair of the Judiciary Committee, criticized the Republicans for holding to a double standard, for not having called likewise for the resignation of Senator David Vitter (R-LA), accused in a call girl scandal. Leahy said further that the Republicans were motivated by politics, in that Craig would be replaced by a Republican governor while Vitter would be replaced by a Democratic governor. Ensign, for the Republicans, denied the double standard, saying on ABC that Craig had pleaded guilty to a crime while Vitter was only accused. Senator Arlen Specter, then (R-PA), encouraged Craig to fight to withdraw his guilty plea, concluding on Fox News Sunday \\"I think he could be vindicated.\\" Senate GOP leaders including Mitch McConnell (KY) and Trent Lott (MS) asked Craig to \\"temporarily step down as the top Republican on the Veterans Affairs Committee, Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior and Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests.\\" Craig subsequently agreed to step down from those posts as the ranking Minority member. Patrick Sammon, president of the Log Cabin Republicans, issued a statement condemning the senator's actions. Resignation announcement/reversal, and motion to withdraw plea At a news conference on September 1, 2007, Craig announced his intent to resign, \\"with sadness and deep regret\\", effective September 30, 2007. On September 4, 2007, a spokesperson for Craig indicated that he was reconsidering his decision to resign, if his conviction was rapidly overturned and his committee assignments were restored. On September 10, 2007, Craig's attorneys filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that it \\"was not knowing and intelligent and therefore was in violation of his constitutional rights.\\" His lawyers further argued that Craig \\"felt compelled to grasp the lifeline,\\" hoping that if he were to submit to an interview and plead guilty that none of the allegations would be made public. The motion argued that Craig had entered the plea under stress caused by media inquiries into his sexuality. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed an amicus curiae brief stating that the secret sting operation used by the police was not \\"carefully crafted\\" to avoid ensnaring innocent speech and that \\"the defendant should be permitted to withdraw his plea, and, should the state recharge him, to contest the constitutional validity of any prosecution.\\" Craig's motion hearing to withdraw his guilty plea was held on September 26, 2007, before Judge Charles A. Porter, Jr. Craig's Washington D.C. attorney, William Martin, argued that Craig's actions could not be considered disorderly conduct because \\"you should have either touching, or words, or a combination of the two.\\" The other main argument was made by Craig's Minneapolis attorney, Thomas Kelly, who argued that the mail-in petition used by Craig was \\"defective\\" because it lacked a judge's signature. On September 26, 2007, Craig released a statement that he would remain in office until the Hennepin County District Court judge ruled on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On October 4, 2007, Porter denied Craig's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, ruling that Craig's plea was accurate, voluntary, and intelligent, and that evidence supported the conviction. As part of Craig's appeal of this ruling, the ACLU filed a brief that cited a Minnesota Supreme Court ruling from 38 years earlier finding that those engaging in sexual encounters in closed stalls in otherwise public restrooms \\"have a reasonable expectation of privacy,\\" a finding that the ACLU argued would contradict the state's claim that Craig was inviting the undercover officer to have sex \\"in public.\\" After Judge Porter's ruling, Craig announced that despite his pledge to the contrary, he would serve out his Senate term. He stated that he intended to \\"continue my effort to clear my name in the Senate Ethics Committee‚Äîsomething that is not possible if I am not serving in the Senate.\\" Craig did not run for re-election in 2008 and left office on January 3, 2009. He was succeeded by Republican Jim Risch, the Lieutenant Governor of Idaho. In September 2008, Craig's attorney argued before a three-judge panel of the Minnesota Court of Appeals that there was insufficient evidence to find Craig guilty of a misdemeanor. In December 2008, the appellate court rejected this attempt to have the guilty plea tossed out and rejected the constitutional challenge to the charges. On January 8, 2009, Craig dropped his appeal to the Minnesota State Supreme Court after his attorney determined that the Court would be unlikely to accept a petition for further review of the case, ending the legal challenge to his guilty plea. Gay men allege sexual contact with Craig In December 2007, eight gay men came forward to the Idaho Statesman newspaper alleging either sexual encounters with Craig, or attempts by Craig to engage in sexual encounters. Four of the men gave the newspaper graphic, recorded details of their alleged sexual encounters. One of the four was Mike Jones, the male escort who in November 2006 had been involved in a sex and methamphetamine scandal with Ted Haggard. Jones claimed that Craig had paid him $200 for a massage and oral sex. A Craig spokesman responded, \\"Mike Jones is lying in order to sell his book [about Ted Haggard]‚Äîplain and simple. Larry has never met Mike Jones.\\" Use of campaign funds for legal defense=February 2008 Senate Ethics Committee letter= On February 13, 2008, the Senate Ethics Committee sent a letter of admonition to Craig, stating that his \\"improper conduct\\" reflected \\"discreditably\\" on the United States Senate. The Committee held that Craig had indeed committed the actions for which he had pleaded guilty, and that his efforts to withdraw his guilty plea were intended to evade the repercussions of his actions. Noting that Craig had tapped campaign funds to spend $213,000 for legal fees and public relations fees on the case, the Committee argued that this showed his disregard of ethics. Campaign funds may only pay legal bills when they are related to the senator's official duties. =2012 FEC lawsuit= In June 2012, the Federal Election Commission sued Craig for repayment of $217,000 of campaign funds plus fines of $6,500 from the former Senator and his treasurer, Kaye O'Riordan. Craig used the money to pay for his defense in the case. In an August 2012 filing, Craig's lawyer Andrew Herman wrote \\"Not only was the trip itself constitutionally required, but Senate rules sanction reimbursement for any cost relating to a senator's use of a bathroom while on official travel\\"; the filing cited an FEC ruling that allowed former Congressman Jim Kolbe to use campaign funds for his legal defense in the Mark Foley scandal. In March 2013, the court found \\"expenditures for legal fees\\" unqualified as \\"ordinary and necessary expenses in connection with Mr. Craig's duties as a federal officeholder and ... irrespective of his duties as an officeholder.\\" Craig appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On March 4, 2016, the Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling and ordered Craig to pay $242,533 to the United States Treasury Department. Aftermath Both the 2009 documentary Outrage and Newsweeks June 7, 2010, issue's Back Story listed Craig as one of several prominent conservative politicians who had a record of anti-gay legislation and later caught in a gay sex scandal. The stall (second from right) at the Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul Airport bathroom in which the incident occurred gained notoriety. The restroom was later demolished. Craig's airport men's room arrest is used in a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" episode of Law & Order‚Äîepisode 6 of Season 18 (\\"Political Animal\\") in the long running television series. A New York City councilman is shown \\"foot tapping\\" and runs his hand under the wall of the stall occupied by Lupo (Jeremy Sisto). Lupo subsequently arrests the councilman who later loudly declares \\"I am not gay!\\" to some assembled reporters much like Larry Craig did. Similarly, a December 2007 episode of Boston Legal was based on this scandal; where William Shatner's character Denny Crane was arrested for solicitation in a bathroom, because of tapping in a stall while constipated. Larry Craig's name is directly referenced. Robert Lund's and M. Spaff Sumsion's 2007 CD \\"Politicked Off!\\" had a parody of J. Geils Band's \\"Centerfold\\", entitled \\"My Men's Room Date's a Senator\\", which refers to the incident. In the 2018 release of Deadpool 2, Deadpool is apologizing to Colossus and references the incident. He says \\"I'm sorry. You trusted me. I took that trust and I turned it into a glory hole in an airport bathroom. The one in Minneapolis. You know the one.\\"  See also  * Lawrence v.

It was released on June 18, 1996 via Michael Jackson's record label, MJJ Music, after a demo tape was played to him by producer Teddy Riley. The album has been described as a \\"sumptuous blend\\" of vocal R&B; and \\"90s production techniques\\", that alternates between smooth ballads and new jack swing. Personal received mixed reviews from music critics, with some critics noting similarities between the group and Boyz II Men. Some critics felt as if the material was unmemorable versions of Boyz II Men songs, while others felt that Personal was highly different from the music at the time. The album only managed to chart in the United States, where it peaked at 14 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums, 29 on the Billboard R&B; Albums and 186 on the Billboard Top 200. Two singles were released to promote the album: \\"House Keeper\\" and \\"Do Thangz\\". The former was a commercial success, peaking at number 13 on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and at 67 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.  Development and composition  Michael Jackson signed the group to his record label, MJJ Music, after a demo tape was played to him by producer Teddy Riley in 1993. Composed of George Spencer III, Corley Randolph, Desmond T. Greggs, Brian L. DeRamus and Prathan \\"Spanky\\" Williams, Men of Vizion were formed in the early 1990s in Brooklyn, New York. Their vocal R&B; harmonies impressed American entertainer Michael Jackson, who signed the group to his record label, MJJ Music, after a demo tape was played to him by producer Teddy Riley in 1993. Greggs told Billboard magazine that the band is \\"here to prove that intimate songwriting in R&B; is coming back\\". He concluded by stating that the band was writing songs \\"that everyone will understand\\". Personal is a \\"sumptuous blend\\" of vocal R&B; and \\"90s production techniques\\", that alternates between smooth ballads and new jack swing. The album incorporates all of the band's beliefs and emotions, from love, romance and sensitivity. \\"House Keeper\\" is a story of reversal of the traditional roles that men and women play in relationships. The rest of the album \\"rolls along similarly\\", with the songs \\"Forgive Me\\", \\"Joyride\\" and \\"Do Thangz\\", a mid-tempo song on which the group pay homage to the females in their lives. A cover of The Jackson 5's 1977 hit single \\"Show You the Way to Go\\" is included on the album. The cover was originally recorded and released on the soundtrack of the 1995 film Money Train.  Release and promotion  Originally set for release on May 14, 1996, Personal was released by MJJ Music, 550 Music and Epic Records on June 18. The album debuted at 186 on the Billboard Top 200 for the chart issued on July 6. It exited the chart the following week, to re- enter at the same position for the chart issued on July 20. The album spent a total of four weeks in the chart, before its exit on the week of August 10. Personal debuted at its peak position of 29 on the U.S. Billboard R&B; Albums on the chart issued on July 6. Spending a total of ten weeks on the R&B; Albums chart, the album received its final position of 87 on the chart issued on September 7. Personal debuted at 14 on U.S. Billboard Heatseekers Album chart on the chart issued on July 6. It dropped to 16 in the following week, before moving back to the 14th position on July 20, where it stayed for a second week. The album exited the Heatseekers Album chart on the week of September 7, spending a total of nine weeks on it. \\"House Keeper\\" was released as the lead single from the album on April 9, 1996. To promote the single, tying in with the song's lyric play on reversed gender roles, the group performed track dates at \\"ladies only\\" functions. The trek was sponsored by major-market radio stations. The song peaked at number 13 on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and at 67 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. An accompanying music video for \\"House Keeper\\" was directed by Jesse Vaughan. \\"Do Thangz\\" was released as the second, and final, single from the album on October 8, 1996. It peaked at number 53 on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Lionel C. Martin.  Critical reception  Darryl Scipio of Vibe stated unlike \\"today's masculine R&B;\\" that is \\"laden with jokers who sing of little but freekin' girls‚Äîand then of keeping it on the down-low\\", Personal doesn't use \\"wordy descriptions of sex to get you in the mood to dance\\". Scipio stated that all 12 songs on the album feature \\"tight, bouncy production\\" and that all the members of the group sing confidently; \\"there are no weak vocals here\\". He cited \\"House Keeper\\" and \\"Personal\\" as having the most soul, \\"but the rest stand solidly\\". He concluded his review of the album by stating that: \\"These visionaries are definitely a sound for sore ears\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared the group and the musical style of Personal to that of Boyz II Men. Erlewine stated that where Boyz II Men have first-rate professional songwriters and producers, Men of Vizion merely have \\"competent hacks\\", which means that \\"no matter how hard the group tries, they can't make any of these songs memorable\\". Jai Henry of The Daily Cougar commented that although at times they sound \\"a little too much\\" like Blackstreet, Men of Vizion \\"definitely have their own sound\\". Jean A. Williams of the Chicago Sun-Times remarked that while the group demonstrates \\"good, strong and genuine vocal ability\\" on the album, what they need is \\"something to set them apart from the proliferation of male harmony groups of the R&B;/soul persuasion\\". Williams complimented the group's cover of \\"Show You the Way to Go\\" as a \\"nice effort\\" but called \\"House Keeper\\" derivative. Ray Marcano of the Dayton Daily News wrote that the album's ballads - especially \\"That's Alright\\" and \\"When You Need Someone\\" - have \\"terrific melodies and wonderful hooks that will easily keep listeners' attention\\". Marcano was, however, critical of the group's indistinct harmonies and said their vocals need to be \\"a bit sharper\\". Jerome Cannon of the Chattanooga Times Free Press complimented Men of Vizion's harmonies on \\"It's Alright\\" and said that what caught his attention about the album was that the group were \\"not caught up in what every other new male group is trying to do, and that is to imitate Boyz II Men\\".

Set in a remote village in the Karoo, the play depicts the trials and tribulations of a young girl called Thozama. In the play, the main character Thozama ends up killing a moose that is inexplicably in the middle of the Karoo, and it shows all the events that follow. This play combines elements of magical realism and African story telling to tell the story of the inevitable breach of innocence that so many children in South Africa suffer. The themes of the play are present to show that in order for such a pattern of violence and the breach of innocence to end, something completely out of the ordinary/external must take place. The play won multiple awards in its native South Africa. In 2009, the play transferred to the Tricycle Theatre in London, where it formed the first half of a mini South African season. The play received positive reviews from the London theatre critics.

The organisation promotes the arts in prisons, secure hospitals, immigration centres and in the community, encouraging creativity and the acquisition of new skills as a means to rehabilitation. The Koestler awards were founded in 1962 and the organisation became a charitable trust in 1969 following a bequest from the British-Hungarian author, Arthur Koestler. Koestler's prison experience Koestler had been detained in three jails in separate countries. In Spain, he was sentenced to death in 1936 for espionage under Francisco Franco's regime. Here, he witnessed many executions, and was held in solitary confinement. He was arrested in France a few years later and held in the Le Vernet Internment Camp for subversion. Koestler was released and fled to England, where he was held at Pentonville as a suspected illegal immigrant. Creation of the Koestler Trust Catching Dreams-254 His experiences in prison led him to write Darkness at Noon and newspaper articles campaigning for the abolition of capital punishment in the 1950s. He also attempted to change the experience of incarceration, stating that in prison, \\"the main problem is apathy, depression and gradual dehumanisation. The spark dies.\\" Koestler spoke of being intellectually under-stimulated and terrorized in prison, and wanted to provide \\"an imaginative and exciting way to stimulate as far as possible and in as many cases as possible the mind and spirit of the prisoner.\\" In 1962, Koestler arranged the Arthur Koestler Award through the Home Office of the United Kingdom, to award monetary prizes for artistic achievement to prisoners, detainees, and psychiatric patients and following a donation from Koestler became a charitable trust in 1969. Koestler gave a further bequest of ¬£10,000 on his death. The trust became Koestler Arts in 2019. Koestler Arts today FREE, 2012 exhibition of entries to the Koestler Awards curated by Sarah Lucas Today the Koestler Awards cover over 50 artforms, across music, writing, crafts, design, performance and fine art.

Biography Jos√© Couso was born in Ferrol in 1965 to a family of military tradition. He graduated with a degree in Communication and Media Studies from Complutense University of Madrid. He worked on assignments for several organizations, including EFE and Canal Plus, and was a cameraman for the Telecinco television network for eight years, covering major news stories such as the kidnapping of his coworker Jon Sistiaga in Macedonia, the 1998 Baghdad bombings, the Kosovo War in 1999, various reports from the BIO Hesp√©rides ship in Antarctica in 2001, a report from the French caves of Lascaux, the incident on Perejil Island during the same year, and the Prestige oil spill. Jos√© Couso was married and had two children. =Gulf War= Couso went to Iraq, along with several coworkers from Telecinco, right before the 2003 invasion. Of the group, only two stayed in Baghdad: Jon Sistiaga as a journalist and Jos√© Couso as a camera operator. The other members of the team went back to Spain a few days before the bombings began. On 8 April 2003, Jos√© Couso was at the Palestine Hotel, where many foreign reporters were staying. At that time, a company of the 3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army was fighting on the other side of the river Tigris. An M1 Abrams tank fired its 120mm Rheinmetall L44 cannon at the hotel. The round hit the 15th floor, where the Reuters team was staying, causing the immediate death of the Ukrainian journalist Taras Protsyuk. At the time, Jos√© Couso was filming on the 14th floor and was seriously injured. Couso was transported to a Baghdad hospital, where he died during an operation. =Military personnel involved= U.S. Army Staff Sergeant (then Sergeant) Shawn Gibson (alt: Timothy, Tom) of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division is one of three US soldiers for whom a Spanish court issued an international arrest warrant citing the murder of Telecinco cameraman Jos√© Couso in April 2003. The 38-year-old Gibson was commanding an M1 Abrams tank, when he was ordered to fire on Baghdad's Hotel Palestine after he reported seeing somebody with binoculars on the rooftop. His single shell hit a 15th floor balcony, killing Couso and Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk. He was later quoted as saying I didn‚Äôt fire immediately. I called my chiefs and told them what I‚Äôd seen. Ten minutes later they called me and told me to fire and I did. (Tape B, 1:11:45) In August 2003 the US military announced the results of an enquiry into the incident, which concluded that the firing of the shell was legitimate because there was positive evidence they were under observation from attackers. Six months later Reporters Without Borders announced that, while they did not think there was a case against the three ground-level soldiers involved, they wanted to see an investigation launched into their superior officers. In March 2006, the charges against Gibson were dismissed, but the Supreme Court of Spain overruled that decision in January 2007 and Gibson's arrest was reordered. Reactions to Couso's death The Pentagon acknowledged the source of the attack, alleging that the soldiers who fired on the hotel, under the command of Sergeant Thomas Gibson, were replying to enemy fire. Following the death of Couso, there were protests in front of the American diplomatic posts in Spain and several civil and judicial actions in order to determine the liability of the people involved. Up to now, there are still concentrations of people demanding justice on the 8th of each month in front of the United States Embassy in Madrid. On 19 October 2005, the Audiencia Nacional of Spain opened a preliminary investigation with an international arrest warrant against three of the involved U.S. military personnel. During the investigation. it called as witnesses the journalists Olga Rodr√≠guez, Jon Sistiaga and Carlos Hern√°ndez. The Sala II de lo Penal of the Audiencia Nacional closed the investigation on 10 March 2006, saying that the event was an act of war, a decision which was appealed by the family of the deceased before the Tribunal Supremo. On 5 December 2006 the Supreme Court of Spain () unanimously granted the appeal by Couso's family against the decision by the Audiencia Nacional. Santiago Pedraz, judge of the Audiencia Nacional, reactivated the international arrest warrant against the 3 military personnel on 16 January 2007, after a protracted battle against the state prosecutor. Pedraz accused the soldiers of murder and of a crime against the international community. On 27 April 2007, the judge indicted the three soldiers on the count of murdering Couso. He also accused them of a crime against the international community on the basis of having attacked journalists. The Sala de lo Penal revoked this decision on 13 May 2008, backing the position of the state prosecutor, which asked for the case to be dismissed. On 21 May 2009, Judge Pedraz indicted the 3 U.S. soldiers again. On 29 July 2010, Judge Santiago Pedraz launched a search and arrest warrant against the 3 U.S. soldiers.

The United States warned that recognition would mean war. France was reluctant to act without British collaboration, and the British government rejected intervention. Emperor Napoleon III realized that a war with the United States without allies \\"would spell disaster\\" for France. However, the textile industry used cotton, and Napoleon had sent an army to control Mexico, which could be greatly aided by the Confederacy. At the same time, other French political leaders, such as Foreign Minister √âdouard Thouvenel, supported the United States. Public opinion and economics Philippe and his brother Robert d'Orl√©ans served as officers for the Union. The 22 political newspapers in Paris reflected the range of French public opinion. Their position on the war was determined by their political values regarding democracy, Napoleon III, and their prediction of the ultimate outcome. Issues such as slavery; the Trent affair, which involved Britain; and the economic impact on the French cotton industry did not influence the editors. Their positions on the war determined their responses to such issues. The Confederacy was supported by the conservative supporters of Napoleon III, Legitimists loyal to the House of Bourbon, and Roman Catholic leaders. The Union had the support of Republicans and Orl√©anists (those who wanted a descendant of Louis Philippe I and the House of Orl√©ans on the throne).George M. Blackburn, \\"Paris Newspapers and the American Civil War,\\" Illinois Historical Journal (1991) 84#3 pp 177-193. Pierre-Paul Pecquet du Bellet, unofficial diplomatic agent of the Confederate States of America in France Between 1861 and 1865, the Union blockade cut off Confederate cotton supplies to French textile mills. However France had amassed a large surplus of cotton in 1861, and shortages did not occur until late 1862. By 1863 shortages caused the famine du coton (cotton famine). Mills in Alsace, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Normandy saw prices of cotton double by 1862 and were forced to lay off many workers. However there were cotton imports from India and from the Union, and also government-sponsored public works projects to provide jobs for unemployed textile workers. Napoleon was eager to help the Confederacy, but his two foreign ministers were strongly opposed, as were many business interests. They recognized that trade with the Union trumped the need for Confederate cotton. The Union was the chief importer of French silk, wines, watches, pottery and porcelain, and was an essential provider of wheat and potash to the French economy. As a result the economic factors weighted in favor of neutrality. St√®ve Sainlaude, France and the American Civil War: A Diplomatic History (2019) pp 140-58. Government policy The French government considered the American war a relatively minor issue while France was engaged in multiple diplomatic endeavors in Europe and around the world. Emperor Napoleon III was interested in Central America for trade and plans of a transoceanic canal. He knew that the US strongly opposed and the Confederacy tolerated his plan to create a new empire in Mexico, where his troops landed in December 1861. William L. Dayton, the American minister to France, met the French Foreign Minister, √âdouard Thouvenel, who was pro- Union and was influential in dampening Napoleon‚Äôs initial inclination towards diplomatic recognition of Confederate independence. However, Thouvenel resigned from office in 1862. The Confederate delegate in Paris, John Slidell, was not officially received. However, he made offers to Napoleon III that in exchange for French recognition of the Confederate States and naval help sent to break the blockade, the Confederacy would sell raw cotton to France.Pierre Renouvin, Histoire des relations internationales, (Hachette, 1994) vol. II, pp. 601-606. Count Walewski and Eug√®ne Rouher agreed with him, but British disapproval and especially the Union capture of New Orleans in the spring of 1862 led French diplomacy to oppose the plan. In 1864, Napoleon III sent his confidant, the Philadelphian Thomas W. Evans, as an unofficial diplomat to Lincoln and US Secretary of State William H. Seward. Evans convinced Napoleon that Southern defeat was impending. Slidell succeeded in negotiating a loan of $15,000,000 from Fr√©d√©ric √âmile d'Erlanger and other French capitalists. The money was used to buy ironclad warships as well as military supplies that came in by blockade runners.Judith Fenner Gentry, \\"A Confederate Success in Europe: The Erlanger Loan,\\" Journal of Southern History (1970) 36#2 pp. 157-188 in JSTOR Proposed armistice France proposed a joint mediation with Great Britain and Russia to end the warJames G.

Warships In keeping with its official neutrality, the French government blocked the sale of the ironclad CSS Stonewall prior to delivery to the Confederacy in February 1864 and resold the ship to the Royal Danish Navy. However, the Danes refused to accept the ship because of price disagreements with the shipbuilder, L'Arman.Southern Historical Society Papers Volume VII, Number 6. (1879). p. 263‚Äì280. L'Arman subsequently secretly resold the ship by January 1865 to the Confederacy while it was still at sea. France regained normal diplomatic relations with the US in 1866, and withdrew its troops from Mexico because of threats from Washington.

British Railways used several standard types of wagon. The Conflat A, which could carry one type 'B', or two type 'A', containers, was the most common. It was regularly used to carry AF (frozen food) containers: while the Conflat L, which could carry three smaller containers for bulk powders, was also produced in large numbers. The Conflat B wagon could carry 2 AFP (frozen food) containers. These were slightly wider than the standard AF containers, and were designed to carry loads on pallets. History 'Conflat' is the telegraphic code within the Great Western Railway's coding of railway wagons for a container wagon. Unlike normal wagon loads, containers were only listed to carry furniture or goods (unless they were refrigerated containers, which carried frozen products kept cold by ice) which needed to be placed on a specialist flatbed wagon which had train braking capability due to the fragile nature of the products carried. The wagons were removed from service (as were the containers themselves) when more modern containers came into use.

From 19 to 26 October 2015, De Boer-Buquicchio traveled around Japan (T≈çky≈ç, ≈åsaka, Kawanishi and Naha) for eight days to investigate child trade, sexual exploitation, production of child pornography etc., and she held a press conference at Japan National Press Club in Tokyo on 26 October to report the results. , then a member of the Japanese House of Councillors, claimed that De Boer-Buquicchio's statements contained many prejudices, mistakes and misunderstandings:Yamada Tar≈ç no sanchanneru (), uploaded to Niconico on 20 January 2016. : 1. Around thirty [or thirteen] percent of Japanese school girls engage in enjo k≈çsai (compensated dating). :: In local surveys, 4-5% of responding female high school students said they had engaged in enjo k≈çsai. : 2. The Japanese courts seldom find people violating child pornography laws guilty. :: From 2013 to 2015, 526 people indicted for violation of child pornography law were found guilty and only one acquitted. : 3. The Japanese Child pornography laws (Act on Regulation and Punishment of Acts Relating to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the Protection of Children etc.) stipulates light punishments for criminals. Even though they were judged to be guilty the criminals were only punished with a fine in most cases. :: According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (MOFA), Japanese child pornography laws are not different from those in European countries or USA etc. from the point of view of gravity of punishments. Also, Japanese court statistics indicate that about 95 percent of those found to have broken child pornography laws were sentenced to penal servitude. :4. Japanese police hesitate to investigate cases when the victims do not file police reports. :: Yamada inquired whether her allegation was true for the National Police Agency, which completely denied it officially., p. 133. :5. In Okinawa prefecture, if girls have to run away from home because of family breakdown they have no way to earn money but prostitution. :: No evidence was presented to support this claim. De Boer-Buquicchio said that she had been misheard by the translator; she had said \\"thirteen percent\\" and the translator had heard \\"thirty percent\\". On 2 November 2015, MOFA issued a complaint to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) over De Boer-Buquicchio's comment of 26 October, and asked her to disclose objective data for the claim of thirteen percent. MOFA asked OHCHR to disclose the data from which De Boer-Buquicchio alleged 13%.on 7 November 2015. On 11 November 2015 MOFA received a letter from De Boer-Buquicchios, in which she admitted that there were no objective data supporting the 13% figure, and effectively withdrew her comments., p.132. Report on surrogacy In a report to the UN General Assembly released in September 2019, De Boer-Buquicchio urged states to ratify surrogacy agreements contracted abroad, claiming that \\"a strict interpretation of the notion of the sale or trafficking of children as a criminal offence can have dire consequences\\". She also urged that homosexual couples should be allowed to use surrogacy in order to become parents.Stefano Generrini, \\"UN Envoy Supports Buying and Selling of Children\\", Friday Fax, Center for Family and Human Rights, 12 September 2019.

While these systems can produce both electronically viewable and hard-copy (print) output, the \\"variable-data publishing\\" term today often distinguishes output destined for electronic viewing, rather than that which is destined for hard-copy print (e.g. variable data printing). Essentially the same techniques are employed to perform variable-data publishing, as those utilized with variable data printing. The difference is in the interpretation for output. While variable- data printing may be interpreted to produce various print streams or page- description files (e.g. AFP/IPDS, PostScript, PCL), variable-data publishing produces electronically viewable files, most commonly seen in the forms of PDF, HTML, or XML. Variable-data composition involves the use of data to conditionally: * exhibit text (static blocks and/or variable content) * exhibit images * select fonts * select colors * format page layouts & flows Variable-data may be as simple as an address block or salutation. However, it can be any or all of the document's textual content‚Äîincluding words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or the entire document. In other words, it can make up as little or as much of the document as the composer desires. Variable data may also be used to exhibit various images, such as logos, products, or membership photos. Further, variable-data can be used to build rule-based design schemes, including fonts, colors, and page formats. The possibilities are vast. The variable-data tools available today, make it possible to perform variable-data composition at nearly every stage of document production. However, the level of control that can be achieved varies, based upon how far into the document production process a variable-data tool is deployed. For example, if variable-data insertion occurs just prior to output...it's not likely that the text flow or layout can be altered with nearly as much control as would be available at the time of initial document composition. Many organizations will produce multiple forms of output (aka: multi-channel output), for the same document. This ensures that the published content is available to recipients via any form of access method they might require. When multi-channel output is utilized, integrity between those output channels often becomes important. Variable-data publishing may be performed on everything from a personal computer to a mainframe system. However, the speed and practical output volumes which can be achieved are directly affected by the computer power utilized. Origin of the concept The term variable-data publishing was likely an offshoot of the term \\"variable-data printing\\", first introduced to the printing industry by Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the College of Imaging Arts and Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology. However, the concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop 'mail merge', to complex mainframe applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in the past 3 years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.

He was the father of Christian von Ditfurth, a historian, and Jutta Ditfurth, a writer and journalist. Ditfurth won many awards during his long career, including the Adolf Grimme Awards in 1968, the Bambi Prize in 1972, and the Kalinga Prize in 1978.  Biography  Hoimar Gerhard Friedrich Ernst von Ditfurth was a German physician, academic, and scientific journalist, best known as a television presenter and as a writer of popular books on science. Ditfurth was born in Berlin on 15 October 1921, into the family of the classical philologist Hans- Otto von Ditfurth, a national conservative Prussian cavalry captain. In 1939 he gained his school-leaving Abitur at the Viktoria-Gymnasium in Potsdam (today the Helmholtz-Gymnasium), then studied medical science, psychology, and philosophy at the universities of Berlin and Hamburg, receiving his doctoral degree in 1946. From 1948 to 1960 Ditfurth worked at the university hospital of W√ºrzburg, rising to the position of an assistant medical director. In 1959 he was habilitated at the University of W√ºrzburg and became a private lecturer in psychiatry and neurology. In 1967 he was promoted to associate professor in the medical faculty at the same university, and from 1968 held the same position at the University of Heidelberg. 1960 Ditfurth took a job in the pharmaceutical company C.F. Boehringer of Mannheim, where he was the leader of the so-called ‚ÄúPsycho Lab‚Äù, being responsible for the development and clinical testing of psychotropic drugs. From 1964 until 1971 he was editor of the journal N+M (‚ÄúNaturwissenschaft und Medizin‚Äù). From 1972, the publication was renamed Mannheimer Forum and was published by Ditfurth until his death. In 1969 he refused the position of manager, commenting \\"I don't want to sacrifice my intellectual independence\\", and instead began a new career as a freelance lecturer, publisher, and scientific journalist. Hoimar von Ditfurth was successful as an author of popular science books and as a television presenter on the WDR, SFB, SR, and ZDF networks. Courageously, he tried to bridge the gap between natural sciences and humanities. One focus of his work was to fight against pseudoscience, creationism, and anthropocentrism. In 1949 Hoimar von Ditfurth married Heilwig von Raven. Together they had four children: Jutta (born 1951), Wolf-Christian (born 1953), Donata-Friederike (born 1956) und York-Alexander (born 1957). In 1971 he became well-known to a wider audience by making the ZDF series ‚ÄúQuerschnitt‚Äù (later ‚ÄúQuerschnitte‚Äù) together with Volker Arzt. In the late 1970s he increasingly turned his hand to ecological subjects and became a critic of the western world's belief in progress and economical growth. At the beginning of the 1980s he supported \\"Alliance '90/The Greens\\" in its election campaign. Ditfurth was a member of the German PEN-Zentrum. In his book The Origins of Life: Evolution as Creation (1982), he wrote that science and theology are compatible and argued that evolution is a process brought into being through a divine agency and that creation was not a single event but is instead the long-term process of evolution. The book opposed religious creationism and was described as similar to the theistic evolutionism of Asa Gray.Janet Browne (1984). Review of Paul Heyer 'Nature, human nature, and society: Marx, Darwin, biology, and the human sciences. Medical History, 28, pp. 102-102 . His daughter Jutta Ditfurth became a politician, while his son Christian von Ditfurth became important as a historian, journalist and writer. On 1 November 1989 Ditfurth died of thyroid cancer in Freiburg im Breisgau and was buried in Staufen.

It was published in 2010, and featured on the front page of the New York Times Book Review. In the review, Danielle Trussoni wrote: \\"Helen‚Äôs restlessness and grappling, her realization that 'a woman sees war differently,' provide a new and fascinating perspective on Vietnam.

She was also an inventor and designer who developed a range of products. Following the publication of an erroneous entry in the ONDB in 2016, now corrected Guppy has in recent times been incorrectly credited with the design of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge. She designed and patented her own chain bridge in 1811 (before the announcement of the first competition for a bridge across the Avon Gorge) but this design was never realised. Brunel‚Äôs winning design for a bridge across the Avon Gorge differed from Guppy's patent in several significant ways: it had a deck suspended from flat wrought iron bar links rather than resting on top of chains like Guppy's; and it did not feature riverbed foundations (a key component of Guppy's design) as it was constructed 75 metres above high tide where the piers were not at risk of damage from water erosion. Early history and inventions Sarah Maria Beach was born in Birmingham, England, and baptised in November 1770 as a daughter of Richard and Mary Beach.Birmingham, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538‚Äì1812, Sarah Beach, In: Ancestry.com She married Samuel Guppy in 1795. In 1811 she patented the first of her inventions, a method of making safe piling for bridges. Thomas Telford asked her for permission to use her patented design for suspension bridge foundations, and she granted it to him free of charge. As a friend of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his family she became involved in the Great Western Railway, writing to the directors with ideas and giving her support. In 1841 she wrote a letter recommending planting willows and poplars to stabilise embankments. She continued to offer technical advice despite the fact that, as she wrote, \\"it is unpleasant to speak of oneself‚Äîit may seem boastful particularly in a woman.\\"PRO RAIL 1014/8/7 Patents and publications Cover of Dialogues for Children, 1800 The family took out 10 patents in the first half of the nineteenth century, including a method of keeping ships free of barnacles that led to a government contract worth ¬£40,000. Other inventions included a bed with built-in exercise equipment, a device for a tea or coffee urn which would cook eggs in the steam as well as having a small dish to keep toast warm, and a device for \\"improvements in caulking ships, boats and other vessels.\\" In later life she wrote The Cottagers and Labourers Friend and Dialogues for Children, invented the fire hood or Cook's Comforter, and patented a new type of candlestick that enabled candles to burn longer.One Hundred Key Facts on the Bristol City ‚Äì region and SciencePlaque #932 ‚Äì Open Plaques Marriage and family After marrying Bristol merchant Samuel Guppy they lived in Queen Square and Prince Street,Bristol Record Office BCC/F/E/3285, BCC/F/E/3140 a leading light of the Bristol and Clifton social scene. The couple had six children, including Thomas Richard, who with older brother Samuel operated the Friars Sugar Refinery in Bristol (1826‚Äì42) before becoming an engineer and associate of Brunel, contributing significantly to the design of SS Great Western and SS Great Britain. Brunel painted a portrait of the younger Sarah Guppy c. 1836.Brunel: 'In Love with the Impossible Later life In 1837 the widowed Sarah, now 67, married Richard Eyre Coote, 28 years her junior.

The screenplay by Ernst Redlich and Johannes Riemann is based on a true story, and was adapted from the play by Fritz Gottwald and Rudolph Lothar. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Artur Berger and Emil Stepanek. Plot Ten years after the end of World War I, Austrian soldier Franz leaves Russia and returns to his village, where he is reunited with Frieda, a woman who believes he is her long-lost son. Production Shortly after directing the legal melodrama Voruntersuchung (Preliminary Inquiry) for Max Reinhardt's Theater in der Josefstadt, Otto Preminger was approached by industrialist Heinrich Haas, who had an interest in the burgeoning Austrian film industry and thought Preminger might be interested in directing for the screen. Although Preminger knew nothing about filmmaking and had little passion for the medium, he decided to accept the assignment to keep busy during the summer, when the theater was closed. He cast Attila H√∂rbiger from the Josefstadt company and Viennese musical comedy star Hansi Niese in the lead roles and managed to elicit from them an acting style better suited to the screen than stage. The film was produced by Philipp Hamber, at the time owner of Allianz Film GmbH.Kay Weniger: Zwischen B√ºhne und Baracke, S. 158. Berlin 2008 Werner Michael Schwarz, Die Br√ºder Hamber und die Kiba.

Though not as critically acclaimed as contemporaries Margaret Bourke-White or Dorothea Lange, her work broke new ground in Texas. Biography After growing up in various Texas towns, Polly studied photography at the Clarence Hudson White School of Photography in New York City. In 1935 she was hired as a freelance photographer by the Texas Centennial Exposition to promote the Texas centennial. She was the first photographer to take photos for state marketing and tourism purposes. She travelled alone across the state documenting Texas life. Initially staying in hotels along her route, she accumulating negatives and periodically stopped to develop them. Later a dark room was built onto the back of a truck, allowing her to drive around the state and develop her work along the road. Her photographs appeared with hundreds of articles across the country in magazines like House Beautiful, Pictorial Review, Furniture Age, Architectural Forum, and many others. Texas Parade called Polly \\"one of Texas' finest artists with the camera,\\" and stated that any illustrated book on Texas was likely to contain one or more of her \\"unusual\\" shots.https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsmxm Today, some of her photos are permanently mounted in the Hall of State at Fair Park in Dallas. After her work for the exposition, she was commissioned by various corporations to shoot series of pictures on specific subjects, including cotton, cowboys, and oil. She also shot a series on airplanes for American Airways and the Dallas Aviation School. Smith returned to Austin in 1944 where she attended the University of Texas, studying sculpture and Impressionistic painting until health concerns forced her to end her studies. She continued to paint and sculpt but fought cancer and debilitating illness for the rest of her life. She died in Auburn, California, on June 18, 1980.* https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsmxm ReferencesExternal links * Handbook of Texas * A Texas Journey, The Centennial Photographs of Polly Smith American women photographers American photojournalists 1908 births 1980 deaths 20th-century American women artists People from Ruston, Louisiana 20th-century women photographers ","title":"Polly Smith"},{"id":"23718606","text":"Oudna Airfield is an abandoned World War II military airfield in Tunisia, which was located approximately 7 km southwest of La Mohammedia; about 14 km south-southwest of Tunis It was used by the United States Army Air Force Twelfth Air Force during the North African Campaign as a heavy B-17 Flying Fortress bomber airfield.

Doherty of Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc in 1936. Whereas conventional Class-B amplifiers can clip on high input-signal levels, the Doherty power amplifier can accommodate signals with high peak-to-average power ratios by using two amplifier circuits within the one overall amplifier to accommodate the different signal levels. In this way, the amplifier achieves a high level of linearity while retaining good power efficiency. In Doherty's day, within the Western Electric product line, the eponymous electronic device was operated as a linear amplifier with a driver which was modulated. In the 50,000-watt implementation, the driver was a complete 5,000-watt transmitter which could, if necessary, be operated independently of the Doherty amplifier and the Doherty amplifier was used to raise the 5,000-watt level to the required 50,000-watt level. The amplifier was usually configured as a grounded-cathode, carrier‚Äìpeak amplifier using two vacuum tubes in parallel connection, one as a class B carrier tube and the other as a class B peak tube (power transistors in modern implementations). The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through +90 and ‚àí90 degree phase shifting networks.In order to circumvent Western Electric's patent, RCA utilized +90 and +270 degree phase shifts; as any student of phasor math knows, +270 degrees is equivalent to ‚àí90 degrees, therefore these are effectively the same as +90 and ‚àí90 degree phase shifts (RCA BT-50D, et al.) Alternate configurations included a grounded-grid carrier tube and a grounded-cathode peak tube whereby the driver power was effectively passed- through the carrier tube and was added to the resulting output power, but this benefit was more appropriate for the earlier and less efficient triode implementationsWE 117, CE 317A, CE 317B, WAPE station-built, et al. rather than the later and more efficient tetrode implementations.CE 317C Successor developments As successor to Western Electric Company, Inc. (WE) for radio broadcast transmitters, the Doherty concept was considerably refined by Continental Electronics Manufacturing Company of Dallas, Texas (CE). Early Continental Electronics designs, by James O. Weldon and others, retained most of the characteristics of Doherty's amplifier but added medium-level screen- grid modulation of the driver (317B, et al.). The ultimate refinement was the high-level screen-grid modulation scheme invented by Joseph B. Sainton. Sainton's 317C series consisted of a class C carrier tube in parallel connection with a class C peak tube. The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through +90 and ‚àí90 degree phase-shifting networks as in Doherty's amplifier. The unmodulated radio frequency carrier is applied to the control grids of both tubes, and with the same control grid bias points. Carrier modulation is applied to the screen grids of both tubes, but the screen grid bias points of the carrier and peak tubes are different and are established such that the peak tube is cut off when modulation is absent and the amplifier is producing rated unmodulated carrier power and both tubes are conducting and each tube is contributing twice the rated carrier power during 100% modulation as four times the rated carrier power is required to achieve 100% modulation. As both tubes are operated in class C, a significant improvement in efficiency is thereby achieved in the final stage. In addition, as the tetrode carrier and peak tubes require very little drive power, a significant improvement in efficiency within the driver is achieved as well. The commercial version of the Sainton amplifier employed a cathode- follower modulator, not the push-pull modulator disclosed in the patent,The disclosed push-pull modulator consisted of a phase-splitter with unequal gains followed by a non-inverting cathode-follower modulator (gain less than unity) from the non-inverting side of the phase-splitter and an inverting modulator (gain significantly greater than unity) from the inverting side of the phase- splitter. Therefore, the disclosed push-pull modulator wasn't push-pull at all. The commercial version utilized a pair of tubes in parallel as a cathode- follower modulator with, consequently, no need to balance grossly different gains of the two modulator tubes. However, a scheme to finely balance the two modulator tubes, which had the same nominal gain, was incorporated just the same. and the entire 50,000-watt transmitter was implemented using only nine total tubes of four tube types, all of these being general-purpose, a remarkable achievement, given that the 317C's most significant competitor, RCA's BTA-50G, was implemented using thirty-two total tubes of nine tube types, nearly one-half of these being special-purpose, employed only in the BTA-50G. Nearly 300 CE 317C transmitters were installed in North America alone, easily outdistancing all competitors combined. Modern communication systems have seen sudden resurrection of Doherty amplifiers in 4G and pre-5G massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (mMIMO) based base-stations. The fact that modern communication systems use complex signal modulation schemes like OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) with high peak-to-peak average power ration (PAPR), the probability of amplifier operating at its peak power with its maximum efficiency is very low. The property to Doherty amplifier exhibiting multiple efficiency peaks at various lower power levels makes it an attractive option to boost the average efficiency of modern-day transmitters. The Doherty amplifier can accomplish by using a technique called \\"Dynamic Load Modulation\\" wherein the load seen by the main amplifier changes as a function of power level in-order to boost the efficiency at lower power levels.

The word metadatabase is an addition to the dictionary. Originally, metadata was only a common term referring simply to \\"data about data\\", such as tags, keywords, and markup headers. However, in this technology, the concept of metadata is extended to also include such data and knowledge representation as information models (e.g., relations, entities-relationships, and objects), application logic (e.g., production rules), and analytic models (e.g., simulation, optimization, and mathematical algorithms). In the case of analytic models, it is also referred to as a Modelbase.Hsu, C., Service Science: Design for Service Scaling and Transformation, World Scientific and Imperial College Press, 2009. , . These classes of metadata are integrated with some modeling ontologyHsu, C.

Individual models are interpreted as metadata and entered into these tables. As such, models are inserted, retrieved, updated, and deleted in the same manner as ordinary data do in an ordinary (relational) database. Users will also formulate global queries and requests for processing of local databases through the Metadatabase, using the globally integrated metadata. The Metadatabase structure can be implemented in any open technology for relational databases.  Significance  The Metadatabase technology is developed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, New York, by a group of faculty and students (see the references at the end of the article), starting in late 1980s. Its main contribution includes the extension of the concept of metadata and metadata management, and the original approach of designing a database for metadata applications. These conceptual results continue to motivate new research and new applications. At the level of particular design, its openness and scalability is tied to that of the particular ontology proposed: It requires reverse-representation of the application models in order to save them into the meta-relations. In theory, the ontology is neutral, and it has been proven in some industrial applications.Cho, J. and Hsu, C. \\"A Tool for Minimizing Update Errors for Workflow Applications: the CARD Model,\\" Computers and Industrial Engineering, Vol. 49, 2005, pp 199-220. However, it needs more development to establish it for the field as an open technology. The requirement of reverse-representation is common to any global information integration technology. A way to facilitate it is in the Metadatabase approach is to distribute a core portion of it at each local site, to allow for peer-to-peer translation on the fly.

History French forces first under the command of de Broglie were surrounded by a large Austrian army in June 1742. A French relief column forced the Austrians to partially lift the siege in September, at which time de Broglie escaped from the besieged city, leaving it under the command of Belle-Isle. When the Austrians renewed the siege after halting the advance of the French relief, conditions in the city became quite difficult, but the Austrians failed to maintain a tight cordon around the city. On 16 December, Belle-Isle led 14,000 troops out of the city on a ten-day march to the French-held city of Cheb. In wintry conditions, Belle-Isle succeeded in fending off Austrian scouting parties until the army reached the Bohemian Forest four days later. The Austrian command did not learn of the French departure until 18 December, but believed they had successfully cut off all the routes of escape when Belle-Isle boldly led his army off the road and into the mountains. After a difficult crossing in which weather and disease took a marked toll on the French army, they reached Cheb on 26 December. The 6,000 men, mostly wounded and sick, that Belle-Isle left in Prague afterward successfully negotiated a withdrawal from the city with the honours of war.

It is situated on Broad Top Mountain near the eastern slope. It was founded in 1872 as part of the construction of the East Broad Top Railroad and Coal Company as the original terminus and mining location. The town was created by the EBT's parent company, the Rockhill Iron and Coal Company, which operated most of the mines on the east side of the Broad Top Coal field. The initial focus of mining was the Houk Mine (renamed Rockhill Iron and Coal Mine #1) which predated the town, though as a much smaller producer. Later RI&C; #5 became a large producer. Mines #2, #3 and #4 were in Robertsdale but were not large producers and operated only briefly. Later the EBT was extended to Woodvale, Alvan and new Alvan as the focus of mining moved along the coal seams, though Robertsdale remained the mining headquarters. Robertsdale was a typical coal ming town complete with company owned miner houses, a company store, a company owned water and power system and other company owned facilities. Coal mining and its support industries were the principal employers. As coal demand declined after World War II, the deep mines began to close in favor or more economical strip mining. The last of the deep coal mines closed in the early 1950s. As the demand continued to slack, RI&C; shut down in 1956 along with the EBT and both were sold to the Kovalchick Salvage Company of Indiana, Pennsylvania. Limited deep mining resumed under contractors and contract surface mining continued into the 1990s. Limited surface mining resumed in the late 2000s. Although the EBT ceased operations in 1956, the track and structures are still in place through Robertsdale. The Station building is currently the museum for Friends of the East Broad Top, who also own the Rockhill Iron and Coal Company post office building. The Reality theater which was built in 1948 just as the slide in coal demand started, and the former United Methodist Church are now owned by the Broad Top Coal Miners Historical Society as their Broad Top Coal Miners Museum and Entertainment Center. In the wake of the RI&C; sale and the end of large scale mining, most miner homes were sold off by their occupants. The EBT continued to operate and maintain the ancient water system until it was replaced by a new municipal system in the 1990s.

Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage. The name Franco-Terreneuvian derives from Terre-Neuve, the French name of Newfoundland. The Franco- Newfoundlander community is most prominently associated with the Port au Port area near Stephenville, in communities such as Trois-Cailloux, Cap-Saint- Georges, La Grand'Terre, L'Anse-aux-Canards and Maisons-d'Hiver. This region is unique as the only area in the province that is officially designated by provincial law as a bilingual district. However, francophone communities are also present throughout the province, particularly in St. John's, Labrador City and Happy Valley-Goose Bay.Modern Francophones. Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage. Newfoundland and Labrador's francophone community and its culture derive from a unique mix of influences and immigrants from Quebec, Acadia, St. Pierre and Miquelon, Brittany and the Basque Country, much of it predating Newfoundland's admission as a Canadian province in 1949.French Settlement. Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage. Some aspects of the community's unique culture, however, have been lost or threatened as the community became more closely integrated into the mainstream of French Canadian culture and society after 1949.Gerald Thomas, The Two Traditions: The Art of Storytelling amongst French Newfoundlanders. Breakwater Press, 1993. Flag The Franco- Newfoundlander flag is based on the French tricolour and Acadian flag, with three unequal panels of blue, white, and red. Two yellow sails are set on the line between the white and red panels. The sail on top is charged with a spruce twig, while the bottom sail is charged with a pitcher flower. These emblems are outlined in black. The sails represent early Basque, Breton, and French fishermen that came to the area in 1504. At the same time, they are symbols of action and progress. The yellow is taken from the star of the Acadian flag. The spruce twig is the emblem of Labrador and is also found on the Labrador flag. Newfoundland and Labrador's provincial flower is the insect-eating pitcher plant. History Since the 16th century, fishermen from France have fished around Newfoundland. The French established colonies in coves of Placentia Bay and Fortune Bay in the 17th century and they also made settlements on the north coast of the island while the Basque used the west coast. The French and English fishermen got along well however France and England both laid claim to Newfoundland and fought many wars over it (including the Avalon Peninsula Campaign when French forces burned English settlements on the Avalon Peninsula). The Treaty of Utrecht required France to abandon their settlements on the island and to recognize British sovereignty over it however the French were granted the French Shore (between Cape Bonavista and Point Riche) where they would be allowed to fish.http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/french-presence- newfoundland.php Most French settlers in Newfoundland left and went to √éle- Royale. The Treaty of Paris was signed between the British and the French in 1763 and it ceded Saint Pierre and Miquelon from Newfoundland to France.http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h754.html As English settlers started moving to Bonavista Bay and Notre Dame Bay (both part of the French Shore), the location of the French Shore was moved to between Cape St. John and Cape Ray. France continued to fish along the French Shore until 1904. While France was not permitted to establish settlements on the French Shore, some French people migrated to the region anyway. Migrants came from France and Saint- Pierre while some Acadians also settled on the shore. The highest concentration of French settlements was at Bay St. George. Some Mi'kmaq settled alongside the French (many Mi'kmaq people had Acadian ancestry) however many of them hid their heritage and assimilated with the French. In the 19th century, many English and Irish settlers arrived on the west coast and lived alongside the French. Many French people hid their French origins and often used English names (names such as \\"Beno√Æt\\", \\"Aucoin\\", \\"Leblanc\\" and \\"Lejeune\\" became \\"Bennett\\", \\"O'Quinn\\", \\"White\\" and \\"Young\\"). Language Historically, Franco-Newfoundlanders were associated with the distinct Newfoundland French dialect. However, that dialect is now endangered, and most francophones in the province now speak either Acadian French, due to the influence of the Maritime Provinces, or Quebec French, which is the primary dialect of French instruction in schools. The majority of Franco- Newfoundlanders, however, live their day-to-day lives partially or predominantly in English, due to their status as a small minority in a primarily anglophone province. In the Canada 2006 Census, just 650 people in the entire province identified themselves as being exclusively French- speaking,Population by language spoken most often at home and age groups, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories. while 30,545 identified themselves as being of at least partial French descent.Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories.

Early life  Eleni was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. She grew up in four different African countries including Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa. She speaks fluent Swahili, English, Amharic and French. She graduated from Rift Valley Academy in Kenya with the highest of honours.

Eleni was selected as \\"Ethiopian Person of the Year\\" for the calendar year (2009/2010 Gregorian) by the Ethiopian newspaper Jimma Times. Career Eleni talks about the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange with Helen Clark, head of the UNDP She was the main driving force behind the development of the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX). Whilst working as a researcher for the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) she examined agricultural markets for many years and noticed, as had many others, that whilst in some years or regions there were severe shortages or droughts in others there were surpluses or bumper harvests. Specifically in her survey of grain traders in 2002, she found that a key factor was the lack of effective infrastructure and services needed for grain markets to function properly. Traders often failed to have access to sufficient credit, information about the market, transportation and other vital resources and contract compliance was difficult to enforce. In 2004 she moved home from the US to lead an IFPRI program to improve Ethiopia's agricultural policies and markets. Specifically she undertook the important role of coordinating the advisory body developing the ECX. She became CEO of the new exchange in 2008, and argued that \\"(W)hen farmers can sell their crops on the open market and get a fair price, they will have much more incentive to be productive, and Ethiopia will be much less prone to food crises\\" .... and that the \\"ECX will allow farmers and traders to link to the global economy, propelling Ethiopian agriculture forward to a whole new level.\\" In February 2013, she became a director of Syngenta.Staff, Syngenta PR.

Genensky (26 July 1927 in New Bedford, Massachusetts ‚Äì 26 June 2009 in Santa Monica, California) was an American computer scientist, best known as an inventor for devices to assist sight-impaired persons. He was also well known for his advocacy on behalf of the blind. Early life and career When Genensky was born, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had a requirement that all newborn babies receive drops of dilute silver nitrate in both eyes, to prevent the possible passage of syphilis from mother to child.http://acbstudents.org/StuAdv/IssueSpring00/php One Man's Story by Samuel M. Genensky, Ph.D. He received the required drops, but unfortunately the chemical had not been diluted, and both his eyes were badly burned. Three months later he was treated by Dr. Frederick H. Verhoeff, a highly regarded specialist in ophthalmology, who performed partial iridectomy on both eyes (thinking that glaucoma would otherwise occur). The result of the burns and the iridectomies was complete loss of vision in Genensky's left eye and near- blindness in the right eye (the best he ever achieved in vision testing was 20/1000). Genensky received elementary schooling (grades 1-8) at the Sylvia Ann Howland School in New Bedford, in special classes geared to visually impaired children. When he applied to attend high school at New Bedford High School, he was directed to the Perkins Institute for the Blind instead (in Watertown, Massachusetts). He attended Perkins for one year (1940‚Äì1941), where he learned Braille. At the end of that year he applied again to attend the regular high school, and this time he was accepted (the previous superintendent had left, and the acting superintendent's sister had been Genensky's teacher at the Howland School). Genensky entered Brown University in 1945 and graduated with a BS degree in physics. He entered Harvard University in 1950 and received an MS degree in mathematics in 1951, after which he worked for the US Bureau of Standards as a mathematician in the Fire Protection Section of the Building Technology Division. Genensky returned to Brown University in 1954 and received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 1958. At that time he was hired by the RAND Corporation and became a member of the senior staff in its Mathematics Department. In 1976 the Santa Monica Hospital invited Genensky to come to the hospital and create a center dedicated to assisting visually impaired persons to remain (or become) an integral part of the overall society. He (along with two colleagues) did make the move, and in 1978 the Center for the Partially Sighted began providing services as part of the hospital's operations (it became an independent organization in April 1983). Development of sight-assisting devices In his one year at Perkins, Genensky quickly learned to read Braille, but also continued to read regular printed materials, and to write with pens. One teacher told him, \\"Why don't you act like a well-behaved blind child?\\" to which he replied, \\"Because I am not blind.\\"One Man's Story He remarked later that this retort had significant importance in his life because by it he permanently placed himself in the camp of the sighted and not in the camp of the blind, and at that point he determined to make it in life \\"using everything [he] had going for [him] including [his] none-too impressive residual vision.\\" During his first year at the regular high school Genensky took his father's World War I binoculars to his geometry class, and realized he could use them to identify circles and triangles on the blackboard. He continued to use them, encouraged by his teacher to do so. Shortly afterward, he was encouraged by Dr. Kenneth Ogel at the Dartmouth Eye Institute to place a +3.5 diopter lens on the left objective lens of the bifocals. This created a \\"giant bifocal system\\" which allowed him to see the blackboard through the right side, then use the left side to write down what he had seen. He used this system throughout the rest of his schooling, and also while employed at the Bureau of Standards and at RAND. While at Brown University, he asked for one concession due to his limited vision: that he be allowed to take his tests in a room that had good lighting, with a chair and desk of acceptable height (he demanded that the times allowed for his testing be the same as those for the other students). While working at RAND a co-worker, Paul Baran found Genensky slumped over an inclined drawing board while writing a company project. Baran remarked that \\"there has to be a better way for you to read and write.\\" Genensky agreed and asked Baran to help him find that better way.One Man's Story Eventually, with additional help from other colleagues at RAND, The Aerospace Corporation, and the Polaroid Corporation, the designed and built the first practical closed-circuit television for the partially sighted, which was first demonstrated at the December 1968 annual conference of the American Academy of Optometry.Video- Mediated Reality: A Versatile Intervention Strategy for People with Low Vision, Institut Nazareth & Louis-Braille, A January 1971 article in Reader's Digest described the system (\\"Sam Genensky's Marvelous Seeing Machine\\"), which brought a flood of interest, and which sparked in Genensky a desire to create a center that would provide sight-impaired persons the necessary services to meet their special needs, and to encourage them to use all their senses (including any available eyesight) to remain an integral part of the human society. It was this new desire that led him to the Santa Monica Hospital and the eventual establishment of the Center for the Partially Sighted. Personal Genensky was born into a Jewish family, and remained active in the American Jewish community for his entire life.

EYE Witness Newsletter, Fall 2007, p. 2, \\"Eighty Years Young, Sam Celebrates Life\\" In 1990 a cataract operation dramatically improved the vision in his right eye (this is when he was stunned to realize that his wife Nancy was red-headed, not brunette as he had assumed for his entire marriage to that point), but the improvement was short-lived, and he was soon using Braille again.An Inventor Whose . .

He also produced some pastels, exhibited at the Royal Academy. He played an important part in advancing the technical aspect of engraving by introducing soft steel plates. Life and work=Early life and training= Lupton was born in Clerkenwell, London, the son of William and Mary Lupton. His father, a working goldsmith, apprenticed him to George Clint by whom he was instructed in mezzotint engraving. Later he became assistant to Samuel William Reynolds, and, when Samuel Cousins was articled to the latter in 1814, Lupton gave him his first lesson. Between 1811 and 1820 he exhibited a few pastel portraits at the Royal Academy. Lupton was the youngest of the engravers employed by J. M. W. Turner upon the \\"Liber Studiorum\\" (\\"Book of Studies\\"), and he executed four of the best of the published and several of the unpublished plates. =Steel plates= Lupton was mainly responsible for the introduction of steel for mezzotint engraving. Hoping to find a more durable substitute for copper, he made experiments on nickel plates, the Chinese alloy called tutenag (an alloy of copper, zinc, and nickel), and steel, and, deciding upon the latter, used it for a successful portrait of Munden the actor, after Clint. In 1822 he received the \\"Isis medal\\" of the Society of Arts for his application of soft steel for engraving - from one plate alone he was still able to get good copy even after 1,500 impressions; all his subsequent works were therefore produced on steel. =Works= In 1825 six plates by Lupton, after Turner, were published with the title Views of the Ports of England. These were reissued in 1856 with six more by Lupton, as The Harbours of England, with text by John Ruskin; be also engraved many of the plates for Gems of Art (1823), Beauties of Claude (1825), Turner and Girtin's River Scenery of England (1827, and Lady Charlotte Bury's The Three Great Sanctuaries of Tuscany (1833). His most notable single plates included The Infant Samuel, after Reynolds; Belshazzar's Feast, after John Martin; Wellington surveying the Field of Waterloo, after Benjamin Haydon; The Eddystons Lighthouse and Fishing at Margate, after Turner; some portraits of theatrical groups after Clint, and portraits after Sir Thomas Lawrence, Henry Perronet Briggs, Thomas Phillips, John Watson Gordon, and others. Lupton also started engraving, a large plate from Turners Calais Pier under the artist's direction, but due to the frequent alterations made by the painter it was never completed. Between 1868 and 1864, he re-engraved fifteen of the Liber Studiorum subjects for a series intended to be issued in parts, but the project failed and the plates remained unpublished. He was an active supporter of the Artists' Annuity Fund, of which he was elected president in 1836. Pupils William Oakley Burgess was his pupil. Death Lupton died on 18 May 1873 at 4 Keppel Street, Russell Square, London, where he had lived for 36 years. Family By his marriage in 1818 to Susanna Oliver he had a family of six sons and one daughter. His youngest son, Nevil Oliver Lupton, born in 1828, won the \\"Turner\\" gold medal of the Royal Academy at the first competition in 1867, and was a frequent exhibitor of landscapes until 1877.

MSN TV Premise Fifteen-year-old Tripp Campbell who lives in Los Angeles, California dreams of being a part of his favorite vintage rock band Iron Weasel. When he wins a radio contest to have dinner with Iron Weasel, his dream comes true. He manages to impress them with his guitar playing and miraculously lands the lead guitarist role. Iron Weasel is made up of three middle-aged stooges ‚Äì lead singer and occasional rhythm guitarist Derek Jupiter, bassist Burger Pitt, and drummer Ash (no last name). The bandmates initially scoff at the idea of having a child in the band, for fear of losing their cool, edgy appeal. But after Tripp offered the guest room and played very well at the school assembly that Tripp hijacked, they agree to let Tripp in the band. Luckily, Tripp convinces his divorced mom, Beth, that the band members will be great role models for him. In their own wacky way, the band will try to mentor Tripp through his high school years with the goal of turning him into a bona fide rock star in the process. Along for the adventure is Tripp's best friend, Izzy Fuentes, an aspiring singer, who will try to keep him not grounded and out of trouble. Tripp has high hopes for Iron Weasel and will do everything he can to help the band make an epic comeback, from booking concert tours, to getting a well-known music agent to listen to their music. Unfortunately, the members of Iron Weasel always seem to find themselves in uncomfortable situations ‚Äì from their nationwide concert tour which ends up being a three venue gig, to protesters boycotting their music because of a silly viral video that was intended to make them popular again. Regardless of their mishaps, Tripp and his bandmates always find a way to come together to resolve their issues and do what they love best ‚Äì play rock n' roll. EpisodesCharacters=Main= *Tripp Campbell (Logan Miller) is the teenage lead guitarist of Iron Weasel who has always dreamed of joining a rock band. Despite his age, Tripp is the most mature of all the members of Iron Weasel and is determined to help the band make a comeback. Tripp is the only Iron Weasel member of the group that is still finishing school. He usually takes out his anger by playing the guitar, as seen in the episode \\"I Want to Punch Stuff\\". He has had many dates and crushes and is allergic to nuts. Tripp is the one who usually solves the band's problems. Throughout the series, Principal Strickland in Season 1 and Principal Jenkins in Season 2 give him detention if he does something by accident, mean, minor, etc. His idol is Derek Jupiter, whom Tripp helped in the episode \\"Pain Games\\" to regain his confidence. *Derek Jupiter (Steve Valentine) is the British, usually selfish, cocky and charming singer. He is known to be a very good magician as shown in episode \\"Magic Tripp\\" and is multilingual. Tripp claims that Derek is the heart and soul of Iron Weasel while Vic Blaylock claims that Derek causes all the problems in the band. He is also the tallest of the band and seems to be a little smarter than Ash and Burger. He admits to have his very own dungeon when Ash found an unfamiliar set of keys in \\"What Happened?\\". He can also play guitar as seen in \\"Slap Goes the Weasel\\", \\"Road Tripp\\", etc. as well as key board, as seen in episode \\"Izzy Gonna Sing\\" and in several other episodes. He is afraid of snakes and on \\"Pain Games\\" he tells Tripp that he once lost confidence in himself after Metal Wolf stole a gig from them (this also sparked his animosity towards them). He usually makes fun of Burger and also tells stupid, boring stories from his family that nobody cares about. Chuck Duran provides Derek's singing voice. *Burger Pitt (Greg Baker) is the food loving, rather dimwitted bass player of Iron Weasel. He has an electric rock star persona, and is shown to have much joy in physical acts, such as smashing his own bass or smashing his head into a wall. He is noticeably overweight and has disgusting habits, including eating worms. Burger is known to have a secret crush on Tripp's mother, Beth, and he often sports black nail polish on his fingers. He also won the first Weasel Prank as revealed in the episode \\"Prank Week\\". A recurring gag throughout the first season included Burger breaking wind on multiple occasions. *Ash (Stephen Full) is the band's amiable drummer, who is often depicted as being the most childish and simple- minded one out of the members of Iron Weasel. He used to have a pet fish named Sushi (and Sushi 2); both of them were killed after Burger's shorted-out bass zapped it. It is shown that he knows random bits of trivia. Ash's catchphrase is \\"Aw Yeah\\". In the episode \\"Slap Goes the Weasel\\", it is revealed that his real name is Ashley. If someone called him that (like Izzy in that episode), he would go into wild tantrums, in a manner similar to Charles after someone calls him \\"Chucky\\". In the episode \\"Road Tripp\\" he reveals that he uses four kinds of hair gel. In the episode \\"What Happened\\", he reveals that his great- great-grandfather wore a pickle suit during the battle at Gettysburg. He seems to be slightly smarter in the second season. His last name is never mentioned. *Izzy Fuentes (Caitlyn Taylor Love) is one of Tripp's best friends and also a huge fan of Iron Weasel among other rock bands. She is also an aspiring singer and has attempted many times to become Iron Weasel's back-up singer. She apparently doesn't know what a prank is according to the episode \\"Prank Week\\". In the episode \\"Izzy Gonna Sing?\\", she temporarily becomes the band's lead singer when Derek is sick and loses his voice. She was in a band with Tripp called Booger Smack in the third grade as seen also in \\"Izzy Gonna Sing?\\". Despite being a main character, she appears almost as a recurring character due to her being absent from many episodes. She is also known to have a crush on Iron Weasel's old lead guitarist (Bleed) in the episode \\"Bleed Guitarist\\". =Supporting= *Beth Campbell (Beth Littleford) is Tripp's loving and supporting mother. She is 41 years old in Season 1, and 42 years old in Season 2. She has custody of Tripp after divorcing her husband. She regrets having Iron Weasel living in her house. It is revealed in the episode \\"Weasels vs. Robots\\" that she is a dental hygienist and also has a large set of plastic teeth. *Principal Cornelius Strickland (Reginald VelJohnson) is Tripp's hot- tempered former principal who deals with many shenanigans at the school, especially involving Iron Weasel, which he really loathes. He is featured in the first season but reappears as the Superintendent in the episode \\"Iron Weasel Gets Schooled\\". His name may be based on Principal Strickland from the Back to the Future. He was promoted to superintendent and was replaced by Principal Maurice Jenkins (Mark Teich) in the second season. *Jared (Aaron Albert) is Tripp's nerdy, exceptionally smart, and odd friend and uses charts a lot. He is 15 years old. He screams like a girl when he gets freaked out. He also has been to a bird calling camp, has a crush on the lunch lady and has a father who builds robots. Jared only appears in the first season of the series. * Ernesto the BestoTV fan (Hollywood Yates) is Iron Weasel's former roadie who is now a mixed martial artist. He's gotten pantsed by Iron Weasel numerous times (including when he was proposing to his girlfriend at a concert and was even arrested for attempting to attack the band after they pantsed him). He eventually returns to get revenge on Iron Weasel for pantsing him, Ernesto and the band eventually makes up, but he gets arrested (and pantsed) again at the end, swearing revenge on the band once more. *Charles \\"Chucky\\" Albertson (Zayne Emory) is the 12-year-old (13 years old in Season 2) kid who got injured because of the Weasel Slap. He is Simon Craig's new stepson who is mean and disrespectful to the Iron Weasel. He hates being called Chucky because it rhymes with \\"Sucky\\" and even goes into wild tantrums after someone calls him that. He also once had a crush on Izzy. He first appears in the episode \\"Slap Goes the Weasel,\\" and did not appear again until \\"Chucky's Revenge.\\" He has since appeared in some season 2 episodes. *Simon Craig (Alan Thicke) is Iron Weasel's manager and Charles' stepfather introduced in Season 2. *Principal Maurice Jenkins (Mark Teich) is Tripp's principal who took the spot Cornelius Strickland had in the first season and dislikes Strickland becoming superintendent. He was introduced in the second season. He is easily agitated by Tripp's behavior and is bothered by Tripp flirting with his daughter Gia. *Bryce Johnson (Spencer Boldman) is a rich, smart, and handsome jock. He stole Tripp's first crush in kindergarten and he stole Lana from Tripp twice. He really dislikes Tripp and made his first appearance in the episode \\"Money Bags\\".

From the Diari Catal√† (1879) Valent√≠ Almirall i Llozer (; Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, 8 March 1841 ‚Äì 1904) was a Spanish politician, considered one of the fathers of modern Catalan nationalism, and more specifically, of the left-wing variety. Biography=Education= Almirall was a student of the School of Fine Arts in Barcelona but had to leave after criticising the Professor Claudi Lorenzale. In the University of Barcelona, he studied philosophy between 1854 and 1857Diccionari d'Hist√≤ria de Catalunya; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; =Politics= Almirall was originally a federal republican who campaigned for the Catalan Countries to be united to form an administrative entity as a part of a Spanish Federal Republic. He participated in the Glorious Revolution of 1868. His wealth and the little vocation he had as a lawyer pushed him into politics. He participated in the preparation and the facts of the revolution of 1868 in Barcelona, directed the newspaper El Federalista (The Federalist) and collaborated with the Federal-Republican Journal, where he published leaflets quite radical like Guerra a Madrid! (War with Madrid!), Bases para la Constituci√≥n federal de la Naci√≥n Espa√±ola y para la del Estado de Catalu√±a (Basis for the federal Constitution of the Spanish Nation and for the one of the Catalan State), Observaciones sobre el modo de plantear la confederaci√≥n en Espa√±a (Observations on the way to propose the confederation in Spain). As a republican he declared himself hostile to any kind of agreement with the monarchic and took part in the Tortosa Pact (18 May 1869), signed by representatives of Republican organizations in Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Aragon. Between 1868 and 1881 he was a member of the Federal Democratic Republican Party (PRDF). He was the leader of the federal intransigents of Barcelona, a minority group within the federal republicanism, based around the Federalists Club (1868‚Äì1869) (of which he was chosen to be the first president) and the newspaper El Estado Catal√°n (1869‚Äì1870 and 1873). Between 1868 and 1869 he guided the publication of El Federalista, characterized by the dogmatism, intransigence, maximalism and idealism of its ideas. This movement wanted to transform the centralized and standardizing Spanish state, into a decentralized federal state through a federal revolution from below, emerged from the initiative of the grassroots classes, a revolution that would involve the federal division of Spanish sovereignty between the Spanish historical regions and the government of the federation. From 1869 to 1873 he published a newspaper called El Estado Catalan and between 1870 and 1874 he led a cultural organisation called La Jove Catalunya (The young Catalonia). In 1880 he founded El Diari Catal√† (The Catalan newspaper), which was the first daily newspaper to be printed in Catalan language. Soon after he organised the 'Catalanist Congress' which was attended by 1200 people but was criticised by the Renaixen√ßa.https://www.jstor.org/stable/259622?read- now=1&loggedin;=true&seq;=5#page_scan_tab_contents In 1881 he abandoned federalism because it was too Spanish in his opinion. In 1882 he founded the Centre Catal√† which tried to bring together all the Catalan cultural and regionalist associations under one umbrella organisation. In 1886 he published 'Lo Catalanisme' which criticised federalism. The Valent√≠ Almirall square in Barcelona is named after him.https://www.idealista.com/archive/barcelona- barcelona/plaza-valenti-almirall Bibliography * 'Valent√≠ Almirall' by Antoni Rovira i Virgili (1936) ReferencesExternal links * Webpage devoted to Valent√≠ Almirall at LletrA (UOC), Catalan Literature Online), in Catalan. 1841 births 1904 deaths University of Barcelona alumni Politicians from Barcelona ","title":"Valent√≠ Almirall i Llozer"},{"id":"23719031","text":"Menzel Heurr Airfield is an abandoned World War II military airfield in Tunisia, which is located approximately 22 km north-northeast of Korba and 60 km east-southeast of Tunis.

Pierre Bi√©try (9 May 1872 ‚Äì 3 December 1918) was a French syndicalist and politician who initially followed orthodox socialism before moving to the right. He was the pioneer of \\"Yellow socialism\\", a movement that has been portrayed as a forerunner of fascism. He was also the maternal grandfather of journalist and White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger. Early life and socialist activity Born in F√™che-l'√âglise, he moved to Algeria as a 13-year-old and stayed four years in the colony before returning home.David M. Gordon, Liberalism and social reform, p. 167 He then became a member of the French Workers' Party (POF) and was praised in its paper, Le Socialiste, for his activity in Franche- Comt√©.Robert Stuart, Marxism and national identity, 2006, p. 141 He was also for a time associated with the followers of Jules Guesde. He was active in a series of strikes between 1898 and 1901 and even led a march of workers in Paris in 1899.George Mosse, Masses and man, 1987, p. 127 Move right His break with socialism occurred around then, largely as a result of his opposition to the idea of a general strike as well as his overall disillusionment with the failure of socialist activity in France. Coupled with his advocation of class co-operation to alleviate working class suffering, that made him quit the POF in 1900. He came to advocate non-political trade union activity and a corporatist relationship between the unions and the employers. He formed his own trade union, the F√©d√©ration nationale des jaunes de France in 1902. As a political arm to his union he also formed the National Socialist Party in 1903.W. Laqueur, Fascism - A Readers Guide, Penguin, 1979, p. 340 Initially the new movement was fairly low-key, but it gained a surge in support in 1910-11 after a series of violent acts by the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail led to many more conservative workers deserting their ranks.David M. Gordon, Liberalism and social reform, p. 114 Bi√©try's somewhat unusual approach to politics and his muddied ideology earned him widespread coverage in the press, which reported him as something of an oddity.Malcolm Anderson, Conservative Politics in France, Allen & Unwin, 1974, p. 224 He became attracted to the anti-Semitism of √âdouard Drumont and soon grafted it on to his corporatist anti-capitalism.George Mosse, Masses and man, 1987, p. 128 His Jaunes movement surprisingly won the support of traditionally- conservative figures such as Victor Henri Rochefort and Paul D√©roul√®de who were attracted to Bi√©try's patriotism as well as Drumont. He briefly enjoyed the support of Action Fran√ßaise, but Bi√©try's headstrong personality meant that was short-lived as it had hoped to dominate his movement.George Mosse, Masses and man, 1987, p. 129 He was elected to Parliament in the 1906 election.P. Davies & D. Lynch, Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right, 2002, p. 198 Later life Ultimately, Bi√©try's period of influence proved short-lived as Charles Maurras and his followers became the main focus of agitation on the right.Zeev Sternhell & David Maisel, Neither right nor left , 1996, p. 48 Les Jaunes held a final congress in 1909, and he declined to run again in the 1910 election.

The square, fully paved and surrounded by old buildings like the sun house (18th century), is more a crossing of small streets than a real square. It is on the hillside of Fourvi√®re and is the low extremity of the hill of Gourguillon. The square is in the center of the zone classified as World Heritage Site by UNESCO. History The street was first named \\"Le treyve du Gourguillon\\". In 1658, archbishop Camille de Neuville did come to Lyon the Regular Canons of St. Augustine. They were installed on the square in 1664 in a house successively owned by the Belli√®vres, the De Langes and the De S√®ves. As they belonged to the Order of the Holy Trinity, the place was renamed Place de la Trinit√©. On 10 January 1794, it was renamed Place du Triangle before reverting to its former name after the French Revolution. The Guignol's house On the square, at the corner with the mont√©e du Gourguillon, there is the sun house, which was built in 1723 and was named so because a golden sun on a blue background is painted between the first and the second floor. The building currently houses on the ground floor a coffeehouse (also named bouchon) of the same name. The waters rushing down the mont√©e du Gourguillon were once collected in the Fontaine des Trois Cornets (fountain of the Three Cones). The coffeehouse and the square are particularly popular as they are the traditional decoration of the Guignol theater. Architecture All the houses of the square are rather old. The \\"house of the sun\\", located at No. 2 rue Saint-Georges, was built in the 17th or 18th century by architect Philibert Delorme. Its northern facade is decorated with the figures of Guignol and Gnafron, a golden sun, a statue of a Madonna and a statue of St. Peter. The facade between the mont√©e du Gourguillon and the rue Tramassac was restored with mullions on three arches of entry and a niche with a head of a lion fountain. The sun is a reference to the owner of the house in the 18th century, named Barou du Soleil.

It was first sung by four-year-old Bo Andersen with the Andersen Family in 1970,Bo Andersen at danskefilm.dk and quickly gained platinum status in Denmark, selling 165,000 copies. In 1970, the Andersen Family won the \\"best Danish band\\" competition sponsored by the newspaper Ekstra Bladet. As a result, the family won a recording contract with Polydor Records, and released \\"Jeg har set en rigtig negermand\\" as its first single. At the same time, the family was performing under contract at Tivoli Gardens, increasing the family's popularity, especially that of \\"Little Bo\\", the 4-year-old lead singer who would go on to achieve fame as a child actor. The song describes different people of varying colors: \\"en rigtig negermand...sort...som en tj√¶respand\\" (a real negro man, black as a bucket of tar), \\"en indianermand...r√∏d...som en ildebrand\\" (an Indian, red as a fire), and \\"en kinesermand...gul...som en sodavand\\" (a Chinese man, yellow as a bottle of soda\\").Song text (in Danish) While some have interpreted this song as carrying a message of racial equality, others have criticized it for its racist language. The former argument focuses on the lyrics, \\"all people [to] be painted blue, to be funnier to look at, and then black and red and yellow and white live together in a world without strife.\\" and \\"Let not the color of skin be a factor. We must meet with wholesome and honest minds.\\" The song has fallen into varying degrees of disfavor as the lyrics use terms and similes considered incorrect by some Danes. However, it is still a recognizable song learned by children even now. The song became known more internationally after its appearance in Thomas Vinterberg's 1998 film Festen. In one scene, the brother of the protagonist sings the song with the intention of hurling racial abuse at a black party guest with whom he has just had a quarrel, so he stands up and calls for every party guest to join him in singing the song. The singer's sister, who happens to be the black man's girlfriend, then tells the latter that it is \\"a racist song\\". Only the first verse of the song is used in the movie, thus angering some that argued this facilitated a misunderstanding of the song as based on racism and xenophobia, while others praise the director's use of the song as a way to highlight the everyday racism that continues to persist in Denmark.

This is one of Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Archdiocese of Boston.  History  Among the immigrants of many ethnic groups, who come to the United States at the end of the nineteenth century, there was a significant number of Poles, who for various reasons left their homeland. Relatively many of them settled in Boston, especially in the southern part of the town of Dorchester. In 1893 to the Italian Sacred Heart Parish in Boston, arrived Polish priest, Fr. Jan M. Chmieli≈Ñski The group selected their representatives, who went to Archbishop John J. Williams, asking him to authorize Fr. Chmieli≈Ñski to organize a Polish congregation. Archbishop John J. Williams has appointed Fr. Chmieli≈Ñski, the pastor of the Polish Catholics of Boston, Salem and elsewhere. In the meantime, a number of parish-related organizations were formed such as: * Polish National Alliance (pol. ZwiƒÖzek Narodowy Polski w USA), * Polish Women's Alliance of American - PWAA (pol. ZwiƒÖzek Polek W Ameryce), * Polish Roman Catholic Union of America (pol. Zjednoczenie Polskie Rzymsko-Katolickie), * Polish Falcons (pol. Polskie Towarzystwo Gimnastyczne \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\"'), * (pol.)

Ko≈Ço Dramatu i ≈öpiewu The architect for the 1903 building was T. Edward Sheehan of Dorchester, MA. Between 1906-1908 three Felician nuns from Buffalo were brought in to teach in the basement of the church. In 1911 a school was completed including a hall in the basement for parish functions. By 1926 school enrollment increased from an initial 103 students to 642. Eight nuns and two lay teachers were hired with approximately 60 students per class. After Fr. Chmielinski's death in 1937, Rev Bartula is appointed pastor followed by Rev. Naguszewski. In 1940 Cardinal William O'Connell entrusts the parish to the Franciscan fathers. Fr. Michael Cieslik. O.F.M. is the first Franciscan pastor and serves until 1942. In 1942, Fr. Stephen Musielak, O.F.M. is appointed pastor and serves as pastor until 1957. During that time, a club for teenagers and young adults was organized using the lower church hall for a meeting place. Fr. Musielak played a leading role in the settling of the post World War II wave of new Polish immigrants helping them locate family and friends in the US and finding lodging, securing employment, establishing residence and obtaining medical care. From 1943-1951 post WWII immigrants and non-Polish families from Old Colony Housing Project create mixed school enrollment. Classes are divided into two separate groups--1. exclusively in English and 2. Polish language as well as English. In 1957 Fr. Angelus Zator is named pastor and services until 1966. He establishes St. Mary's Drum and Bugle Corps as well as a Parent Teachers Association. In 1967 Rev. Edwin Agonis, OFM becomes pastor. In 1968 the church celebrates its 75th Diamond Jubilee with a concelebrated Mass presided over by Cardinal Richard Cushing. In 1973 Rev Manual Wolkanowski OFM is appointed pastor through 1979. Fire ravages the church causing disastrous damage. Permission is granted by Cardinal Humberto Medeiros to repair and rebuild the church. In 1978 Karol Jozef Wojtyla is elected Pope and takes the name, John Paul II. In 1983, the church celebrates its 90th Anniversary.

Biography McGee was born in Francesville, Indiana on March 23, 1897. In his early years he worked in his grandfather‚Äôs bank in a small Montana town, then spent some time in Alaska working in the mines. He returned to Montana and tried homesteading near Livingston, Montana but went broke. In 1929, in the midst of the Great Depression, with no money or prospects, he sneaked aboard the SS Aleutian steamship and made the trip to Seward, Alaska as a stowaway. He went to Anchorage and worked for the Standard Oil Distributor driving a delivery truck. He then started a fur trading business using dog teams and chartered airplanes to travel throughout the area buying furs. He needed his own airplane in order to reach Alaska's remote villages. In 1931 he partnered with Harvey W. Barnhill, an early day Alaska bush pilot to purchase a three-seat Stinson airplane from Varney Airlines in San Francisco. They shipped the plane to Alaska on a steamship and founded Barnhill & McGee Airways in Anchorage. Although \\"Mac\\" learned to fly, his primary interest was in business management and organization. In about 1932, McGee bought Barnhill‚Äôs interest in the company, purchased another Stinson airplane and founded McGee Airways, which was one of the first air services in Anchorage. McGee Airways grew into a fleet of seven black and silver Stinson airplanes. In 1934 he sold the company to Star Air Service a rival company in Anchorage for $50,000 and managed the combined operation for several years before going into mining. Star Air Service became financially unstable after McGee left, and he was called back to manage the company again.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Cam√©ra d'Or. Plot The main story of the film is framed as the reminiscences of an aged Georgian woman recalling her love affair, many years earlier, with an English telegraph worker. Shortly before the Soviet take-over of Georgia in 1921, Christopher Hughes is sent to rural Georgia to work on a telegraph line between the UK and India, which runs through Georgian territory. (This plot element is based on the true story of the Indo-European Telegraph Line, built by Siemens in 1868-1870, and operational until 1931). After the Red Army invades Georgia, the British employees are recalled, but the message ordering him to leave Georgia never reaches Hughes, who has fallen in love with Ana, a young Georgian woman living in a nearby village. Ana‚Äôs brother Nestor, however, is a local Bolshevik leader. There ensues a tense situation in which Hughes is caught between his love for Ana and his hostility toward her brother. Eventually, Hughes and Nestor are reconciled, but in the end both fall victim to a vengeful nobleman who has been dispossessed of his wealth by the new regime. My English Grandfather is Nana Jorjadze's first major film, based on a screenplay by her husband Irakli Kvirikadze. The theme of the foreigner stranded in Soviet Georgia, who has a love affair with a local woman, resurfaces in Jorjadze's best-known film A Chef in Love. Other noteworthy features of the film include the music, composed by Enri Lolashvili, the brother of the actor Janri Lolashvili (who plays the role of Hughes in the film), and the use of foreigners (mostly students residing in Tbilisi at the time) to voice-over the bits of English dialogue that appear in the film. One of them supplied Hughes‚Äô voice throughout the film, including those scenes where he speaks Georgian.

It is similar to Happy Farm, and Farm Town. Its gameplay involves various aspects of farmland management, such as plowing land, planting, growing, and harvesting crops, harvesting trees and raising livestock. FarmVille 2, the sequel, was released in September 2012. The game is available as an Adobe Flash application via the social networking website Facebook and Microsoft's MSN Games. It was previously available as a mobile app for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad for a brief period in 2010. The game is free-to-play; however, to progress quickly within the game, players are encouraged to spend Farm Cash (in FarmVille) or Farm Bucks (in FarmVille 2), which are purchasable with real-world currency. After launching on Facebook in 2009, FarmVille became the most popular game on the site, and held that position for over two years. At its peak, in March 2010, the game had 83.76 million monthly active users. Daily active users peaked at 34.5 million. After 2011, the game began experiencing a considerable decline in popularity. By May 2012, the game was ranked as the seventh most popular Facebook game. As of April 30, 2016, its rank had fallen to the one-hundred-and-tenth most popular Facebook game as measured by daily active users, while FarmVille 2 had climbed to forty-second. On September 27, 2020, Zynga announced that it would discontinue FarmVille on Facebook on December 31, 2020, as Facebook was to stop supporting games running on Flash Player‚Äîrequired by Farmville‚Äîon that day. The company said that development would continue for mobile devices, with Farmville 3 to follow the existing Farmville 2. Gameplay Once players begin a farm, they first create a customizable avatar, which may be changed at any point. One player's customized farm The player begins with an empty farm and a fixed starting number of Farm Coins, the primary currency in the game. Players earn XP (experience points) for performing certain actions in the game such as plowing land or buying items. At certain XP benchmarks, the player's level rises. As the player obtains more items and progresses through levels, crops and animals become available to them via the \\"market\\" where items can be purchased using either Farm Coins or Farm Cash. Farm Cash is earned by leveling up or completing offers, or purchased for real money. The main way a player earns Farm Coins, the less important of the two in-game currencies, is through harvesting crops or visiting their neighbors. The player does this by paying coins for plowing a unit of land. This readies the land for planting seeds, which will eventually be harvested after a set amount of time. The amount of time it takes for a crop to mature, and how much money a crop yields when harvested, is dependent on the crop planted and is noted on its entry in the \\"market\\" dialog. They will wither, or they will be of no use when a crop- specific amount of time has elapsed, the amount of time being equal to 2.5 times the amount of time taken to grow the crop (for example, crops which take 8 hours to grow will wither after 2.5√ó8=20 hours). However, a player can use Farm Cash (purchasable with real-world cash) to purchase an \\"unwither\\" to rejuvenate the crops or can use a biplane with \\"instant grow\\" to cause crops to be immediately available for harvest. Although the biplane can be purchased with coins, this special feature is only available for Farm Cash. As a player levels up more, crops with a higher payoff and economy will become available. Sometimes a crop will need a permit that costs Farm Cash in order to be planted. A player may buy or receive from friends livestock and trees or bushels, such as cherry trees or chickens, which do not wither but instead become ready for harvest for preset amounts of money a set amount of time from their last harvest. Trees and livestock cannot die. = In-game purchases = The two main in-game currencies, Farm Coins and Farm Cash (in FarmVille) or Farm Bucks (in FarmVille 2), are available for purchase from Zynga with real- world money. Coins can also be \\"earned\\" within the game by completing tasks or selling crops, and can be spent on basic in-game items such as seeds. Farm Cash and Farm Bucks are more difficult to acquire within the game, and cannot be earned within the farm's economic system, only by special actions like leveling up or completing tasks. Farm Cash and Farm Bucks provide a route to acquire further in-game items, such as additional animals for the farm, or to acquire in-game resources like animal feed, water, fuel and power, which are otherwise slow and/or laborious for players to acquire. =Social interaction= Like most Zynga games, FarmVille incorporates the social networking aspect of Facebook into many areas of gameplay. Contacting other players allows the player to improve their farm more quickly, by using their help as farmhands or by gaining rewards from helping them. Often the aid of other players is a substitute for Farm Cash, the game's purchasable in-game currency, giving players an effective choice between spamming their friends with FarmVille messages and requests, or paying real-world cash. FarmVille has allowed players to add neighbors that are not Facebook friends, thus allowing the player to have many neighbors at hand. Players invite friends or other players that are not Facebook friends to be their neighbors, allowing them to perform five actions on each other's farms per day by \\"visiting\\" it. Neighbors may also send gifts and supplies to each other, complete specialized tasks together for rewards, and join \\"co-ops\\" - joint efforts to grow a certain amount of certain crops. Gifts are sent as mystery gifts with expensive, but random items, special deliveries with building supplies, or by choosing a particular item to send. They cost the sending user nothing. For FarmVilles 2nd birthday, a series of different mystery gifts were added to the Gifts Page. Development=Partnerships= FarmVille occasionally runs in-game partnerships where users can visit another company's virtual farm and buy or receive items with their brand logo. For example, as of June 9, 2011, users could get free McDonald's hot air balloons, McCafe products and the ability to visit McDonald's' virtual farm. Other brand partnerships include Minion, Frito Lay, Capital One, American Express, Lady Gaga, Rio (the motion picture), Haiti Relief Fund, Discover Card, Cascadian Farm, Megamind, Farmers Insurance, Microsoft Bing, and 7-Eleven. FarmVille also offers engagement advertising where users can interact with a brand in exchange for free Farm Cash through an ad platform called SVnetwork. Release=Expansions= FarmVille has added numerous expansions over the game's lifetime, where players farm in new locales that include England, Hawaii, Japan, Atlantis, Winter holiday locations, Australia and more. As of 2014, FarmVille releases a new farm approximately every six weeks.  Board games  In 2012, Zynga, in conjunction with Hasbro, released several kids' \\"Animal Games\\" based on FarmVille under the \\"Hasbro Gaming\\" imprint. These include versions of Memory (in a \\"Disco Dancing Sheep\\" pouch), Go Fish (in a \\"Groovy Chicken\\" pouch), Old Maid (in a \\"Rockstar Cow\\" pouch), and Hungry Hungry Herd (a redux of Hungry Hungry Hippos with the characters Gobbling Horse, Munching Pig, Snacking Sheep and Chomping Cow replacing the Hippos in the original game). This is one of several games in the Zynga game library to be released as physical board game versions. Others include Draw Something, Words with Friends and a CityVille edition of Monopoly. Reception Despite the initial success of the game, it has received a negative reaction from critics, video game designers, and personalities. Time magazine called the game one of the \\"50 Worst Inventions\\" in recent decades due to it being \\"the most addictive of Facebook games\\" and a \\"series of mindless chores on a digital farm\\". In a December 2010 interview with Gamasutra, game designer and programmer Jonathan Blow criticized FarmVille for being designed to create an atmosphere of negativity, requiring an unprecedented commitment to the game, and encouraging users to exploit their friends. The video game researcher Ian Bogost designed Cow Clicker as a satire of FarmVille and similar Zynga games to deconstruct the repetitiveness and perceived absurdity of such games. =Awards= FarmVille won an award at the Game Developers Conference for the \\"Best New Social/Online Game\\" in 2010.  Sequels  On June 26, 2012, FarmVille 2 was unveiled, and was subsequently released in September 2012. It differs from the original FarmVille in a number of ways. FarmVille 2: Country Escape for mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Windows operating systems) was released on April 10, 2014, and received a positive review from The New York Times. Unlike other games in the FarmVille series, FarmVille 2: Country Escape can be played offline.

Life Milner was second son of John Milner and Mary, daughter of Gilbert Ramsden, born at Skircoat, in the parish of Halifax, and was baptised 10 February 1628. He was educated at the Halifax grammar school and entered at Christ's College, Cambridge, 21 June 1642. He probably left without a degree ahead of the parliamentary visitation of the university. Returning to Halifax he made the acquaintance of John Lake, whose sister he seems to have married. Milner was probably with Lake at Oldham in 1651; it has been inferred that he was schoolmaster at Chadderton appointed in August 1641. Lake's friend was preaching at Oldham as late as 1654. Milner is said to have subsequently returned to Halifax, and at the Restoration was given the curacy of Beeston in the parish of Halifax by Lake, who had then become vicar of Leeds. In 1662 he obtained the degree of B.D. at Cambridge by royal letters. His petition for his degree states that he had been deprived of a good benefice during the rebellion. In the same year he was made minister of St. John's, Leeds, was inducted vicar of Leeds 4 August 1673, and elected prebendary of Ripon 29 March 1681. At the Glorious Revolution of 1688 he joined the nonjurors, was deprived of all his preferments, and retired to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he lived in comparative ease. He died 16 February 1702, and was buried in the college chapel on 19 February. His only son, Thomas, vicar of Bexhill, Sussex, proved a great benefactor to Magdalene College, Cambridge, under his will dated 5 September 1721. Works Milner published: * 'Conjectanea in Isaiam ix. 1, item in Parallela qusedam Veteris ac Novi Testamenti in quibus Versionis LXX Interpretum . . . cum Textu Hebraeo conciliationem meditatur Author,' dedicated to James Duport and Edmund Castell, London, 1673. * 'A Collection of the Church History of Palestine from the Birth of Christ to the Beginning of the Empire of Diocletian,' London, 1688. * 'A Short Dissertation concerning the Four Last Kings of Judah,' London, 1687 or 1689, occasioned by Joseph Scaliger's Judicium de Thesi Chronologica. * 'De Nethinim sive Nethinaeis et de eis qui se Corban Deo nominabant disputatiuncula adversus Eugabinum, Card.

On November 4, 2009, the Court declined to take the case. Petitioners then refiled in state circuit court and the court ruled in June 2011 that the registry is constitutional. That decision was affirmed by a state appeals court in December 2012,Appling v. Doyle, 2013 WI App 3, 345 Wis. 2d 762, 826 N.W.2d 666. and by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in July 2014.Appling v.

Doyle's Veto Message Accessed July 23, 2009. The registry created a legal recognition of same-sex unions in Wisconsin, enumerating 43 rights and benefits for registered couples. On July 23, 2009, Julaine Appling, President of Wisconsin Family Action, through attorneys at the Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) and ADF-allied attorneys in Wisconsin, filed an original action with the Wisconsin Supreme Court asking it to declare the same-sex domestic partnership registry unconstitutional and permanently enjoin the defendants from the enactment of the registry. Wisconsin Attorney General J. B. Van Hollen refused to defend the suit, then titled Appling v. Doyle, agreeing that the registry violated the state constitution. Doyle hired outside counsel to defend it. The petition asserted that the registry violates Wisconsin's Marriage Protection Amendment, ratified by Wisconsin voters on November 7, 2006.WI Passes Marriage Amendment Accessed July 23, 2009.

Petitioners refiled the lawsuit in Dane County District Court in 2010. In 2011, Scott Walker became the Governor of Wisconsin, and in March, he fired the lawyer representing the state. On May 13, Walker petitioned the trial court to allow the state to withdraw from the case, citing his belief that the registry is unconstitutional. Argument The petitioners claimed: The petitioners believed the registry violated the Wisconsin Marriage Protection Amendment because it creates a new legal status for domestic partners. The requirements for obtaining a domestic partnership certificate are the same as those required for obtaining a marriage license. The price for a certificate is the same as for a marriage license.Appling v. Doyle Petition Accessed July 23, 2009.

The Toronto Waterfront Wavedecks are a series of wooden structures constructed on the waterfront of Toronto, Ontario, Canada as part of the revitalization of the central waterfront. Waterfront Toronto committed to constructing a series of unique wooden wavedecks along the water's edge for the 3.5 km area running from Bathurst Street to Parliament Street.Waterfront Toronto All the WaveDecks are accessible from the southside of Queens Quay. The wavedecks are new public spaces that vary in shape, articulation and design to reflect the movement of Lake Ontario. Despite each deck having multiple levels separated by steps, they are all wheelchair accessible. The undulations of each level provide for a smooth, stepless path from one end of the deck to the other (going widthwise). These paths are visually marked by yellow metal discs embedded into the decks themselves. History In June 2006, West 8 and duToit Allsopp Hillier won the Toronto Central Waterfront Innovative Design Competition for their entry that included the construction of a series wavedecks along Toronto's waterfront. Each wavedeck is unique and designed to resemble to the contours of Lake Ontario's shoreline and reclaim parts of the shoreline along water's edge south of Queens Quay.West 8 A total of three WaveDecks were constructed with one more being planned, each acting as unique gateways to the waterfront. Once the transformation is complete, WaveDecks will be at the foots of Spadina Avenue, and Rees, Simcoe, and Parliament streets. The Spadina WaveDeck opened in late-summer of 2008, followed by the opening of the Simcoe WaveDeck in June 2009 and the Rees WaveDeck in July, 2009.

His titles during the reign of Tutankhamun included \\"the true servant who is beneficial to his lord, the king's scribe,\\" \\"the servant beloved of his lord,\\" \\"the Fan- bearer on the Right Side of the King,\\" and \\"the servant who causes to live the name of his lord.\\"James Roger Black \\"The Instruction of Amenemope: A critical edition and commentary, prolegomenon and prologue\\" University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison 2006 These titles were found on five ushabtis that Nakhtmin offered as funerary presents for pharaoh Tutankhamun.Howard Carter \\"The Tomb of Tut-Ankh-Amen, Discovered by the Late Earl of Carnarvon and Howard Carter\\" New York: Cooper Square Publishers, 1963 He was the heir to the throne during the reign of the pharaoh Ay though he never became a pharaoh. It is assumed by scholars that he died towards the end of the reign of Ay (when he seemingly vanished from all records) and Horemheb, the designated heir of Tutankhamun, became pharaoh instead.Wolfgang Helck \\"Urkunden der 18. Dynastie: Texte der Hefte\\" Berlin: Akademie-Verlag 1984 Crown Prince The identity of Nakhtmin's father is not known with certainty. Some scholars suggest that he may have been the son of pharaoh Ay, his mother being known from a statue to be the 'Adoratrix of Min, Songstress of Isis' Iuy.Jacobus Van Dijk, Horemheb and the Struggle for the Throne of Tutankhamun , BACE 7 (1996), p.33. Nakhtmin appears to have been the chosen successor to Ay, but died before he could succeed. On a beautiful statue of Nakhtmin and his wife in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Nakhtmin was identified as the \\"Crown Prince\\" (jrj-pÍú•t) and \\"King's Son\\". (zÍú£-nzw) This title could be completed as \\"King's Son of his own body,\\" which would make him the son of Ay, or it could be completed as the \\"King's Son of Kush\\". There is no record of a Viceroy of Kush by the name of Nakhtmin, and it seems that the nobleman Paser I was Viceroy during that time period. This has led to the identification of Nakhtmin as Ay's son, or adopted son. The statue with the inscription has suffered extensive damage. Only two pieces remain, the head and shoulders of Nakhtmin and the upper part of the body and head of his wife. Both statues look as though the eyes, nose and mouth have been deliberately damaged. This has been interpreted as some form of persecution even after death.The Egyptian Museum Cairo: Official Catalogue, items 195‚Äì196.

It was placed in receivership in July 2007. History The company was originally listed on the New Zealand stock exchange as Bridgevale Mining and changed its name in 1987, the same year it acquired Toy Warehouse. Bridgecorp Holdings was delisted after the toy company ‚Äì considered underperforming ‚Äì was sold in 1992 and went into receivership the same year.NZ Companies Office - The Toy Warehouse Ltd Rod Petricevic effectively took control of Bridgecorp after it was delisted. He tried several times to relist the company, but was rejected by the NZX. In 2002, Bridgecorp Holdings was deregistered in New Zealand and moved its headquarters to Sydney, Australia. Bridgecorp Limited served as a subsidiary for New Zealand while Bridgecorp Finance Ltd was established as its Australian arm. In 2004, Bridgecorp Holdings began trading at Unlisted, a New Zealand- based trading facility. In 2006 the group began reporting the results of the Bridgecorp Limited subsidiary to Unlisted, when it was actually the parent company, Bridgecorp Holdings, whose shares were being traded. In the following three years, the company attracted more than 18,000 investors from both Australia and New Zealand with promised return rates between 9 and 11 percent a year. In August 2006 Bridgecorp Finance was banned from raising money from existing investors by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The commission had issued warnings of \\"solvency issues\\" concerning the group as early as December 2005. Receivership Bridgecorp collapsed in 2007 with most of the Bridgeport companies being placed in receivership afterwards. At this time the company owed 14,500 investors A$467 million. Graham Miller of the Covenant Trustee Company was appointed trustee for the group following its collapse. Rod Petricevic, former chairman Bruce Davidson, Rob Roest, Gary Urwin and Peter Steigrad were charged in July 2007 after Bridgecorp went into receivership. Petricevic sought legal aid to pay for his legal bills, but it was denied on the grounds that he remained a trustee of a family trust with access to considerable wealth. On 5 April 2012 Petricevic, Roest and Steigrad were found guilty of making untrue statements in their investment prospectuses. Urwin and Davidson had earlier pleaded guilty to all charges. On 17 April 2012 Gary Urwin was sentenced to two years in jail. Although Urwin had asked for sentence of home detention, Justice Pamela Andrews said this would not be appropriate. On 26 April 2012, Petricevic was sentenced to six and a half years in jail by Justice Venning. His lawyer, Charles Cato, had argued for a lower sentence due to Petricevic's age and the effect the trial and conviction had had on his family. Justice Venning dismissed the request stating that he was not convinced the remorse shown by Petricevic was genuine. On 18 May 2012, Rob Roest was also sentenced to six and a half years in jail by Justice Venning. His lawyer, Paul Dacre, had asked Justice Venning for a lower sentence than Petricevic's due to undisclosed family issues and the fact Petricevic was the ultimate \\"boss\\" of Bridgecorp. This was again denied with the judge stating that Roest had not shown proper remorse. On the same day Peter Stiegrad was sentenced to nine months' home detention, ordered to complete 200 hours of community services and pay $350,000 in reparation. In October 2012 receiver PwC filed a civil action in the High Court at Auckland for $442 million against three of the former directors for \\"breach of directors' duty\\". Rod Petricevic, Rob Roest, Peter Steigrad, Gary Urwin and Bruce Davidson were named in the suit. As Petricevic and Roest have been declared bankrupt, they are exempt from the legal proceedings. This is one of the largest civil claims in New Zealand history.

Todd, a Republican, was a member of the Houston City Council from 1996 to 2002, representing the eastern edge of Houston. His district included the Johnson Space Center, William P. Hobby Airport, the Houston Ship Channel, and Lake Houston. He chaired the Regulatory Affairs Committee, the Charter Committee, and the Rail Committee. He was also a member of the Aviation, Ethics, and Finance Committees. At the time of his initial election, Todd was the youngest person ever elected to Houston City Council at the age of 31 and has been a mainstay in the business community. Todd is currently Chairman of the Tower Permit Commission for southeast Texas. Personal life Todd was born into a military family in Kirksville, Missouri, but spent time in Oregon, Kansas and Hawaii. He moved to Texas and attended the University of Texas at Austin where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Latin American Studies. After his undergraduate, Todd received a Doctorate of Jurisprudence from the South Texas College of Law. He continues to teach there as an adjunct professor with courses in election law and passage of legislation. On July 30, 2015 Rob Todd became a member of this year's Partnership for Baylor College of Medicine. The partnership is the college's largest volunteer organization and its mission is to \\"create and apply science and discoveries to further education, healthcare and community service locally and globally.\\" Political career As a City of Houston councilmember Todd opposed the expenditure of public funds on the installation of light rail without a public vote, and in 2001 filed suit against the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, to block the project and force a referendum. He argued that taxpayers should be allowed to consider the merits of light rail. He succeeded and as a result, METRORail was put to a public vote. Ultimately, Metro enacted a public policy position that it should not initiate major light rail projects in the greater Houston area unless there was strong evidence that they would reduce air pollution or result in a major reduction in traffic congestion. This position was also supported by United States Congressman Tom DeLay. Todd strongly promoted \\"family values\\", and sternly criticized President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. He even took extreme measures to shut down the store \\"Condoms Galore\\": When a vice-squad raid he requested failed to find any illegal activities at the store, Todd sent in city health inspectors, hoping to find the store selling edible panties without a food license. In his capacity as chairman of the Regulatory Affairs Committee, Todd supported the passage of ordinances aimed at combating vagrancy and designed to restrict behavior such as loitering, begging, and burrowing through trash. Todd's electronic access card to City Hall was revoked in 1997 when he snuck into the Council chamber and wrapped the Mayor's chair with leftover \\"Free Kingwood\\" banners from an anti-annexation rally for that locality. In a recent article from Houston society magazine Lights, Camera, Action, Rob Todd expressed his intention to run for mayor of Houston one day. As part of the magazine's Trailblazers series which features successful entrepreneurs, Todd said, \\"I get encouraged to run all the time. For now, my kids need my full attention so it will have to wait. Eventually...the time will be right.\\" Career after politics Rob Todd continues to support the South Texas College of Law as an adjunct professor. He currently teaches courses on election law and the passage of legislation. In 2003, after leaving city council, Rob Todd founded Amplified Solutions, a real-estate and telecommunications development firm that designs, implements, finances and manages distributed antenna systems, which are advanced antenna systems that support wireless reception for large-scale venues. Amplified Solutions has successfully designed and implemented systems for the Chicago White Sox, Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Memorial Hermann Healthcare Systems, the Detroit Energy Music Theater and W Hotels. In 2015, Amplified Solutions was appointed to the Houston Business Journal's Fast 100 List and subsequently interviewed. The list commemorates the 100 fastest growing companies in Houston. Though he no longer practices, Rob Todd served as an attorney for 27-year-old Ariana Venegas in 2009 during a high-profile sexual harassment lawsuit against Harris County District Court judge Donald Jackson. Jackson was convicted of offering to dismiss Venegas's case in exchange for sex. Todd is an adjunct professor of law at the South Texas College of Law, where he teaches a class on the legislative process. Todd's son Robert lost his hearing as an infant due to meningitis. Todd brought a lawsuit against several movie distributors and producers under the Americans With Disabilities Act, with Robert‚Äîthen in the ninth grade‚Äîas the primary plaintiff. The suit sought to force the companies to provide more films with captioning for the hearing-impaired. Todd succeeded in efforts to provide closed captioning on Houston's government-information Government-access television (GATV) channel so that weekly televised city council meetings would be accessible to the hearing-impaired. He also succeeded in persuading the Hobby Center and the Houston Rodeo to add closed captioning to their performances. , Todd serves as the Chairman of the Tower Permit Commission, which has jurisdiction over towers within a area of southeast Texas. He was recently appointed by Mayor Annise Parker to re-write a comprehensive ordinance that governs cell tower and coverage for the City of Houston.

The International Socialist Congress, Stuttgart 1907 was the Seventh Congress of the Second International. The gathering was held in Stuttgart, Germany from 18 to 24 August 1907 and was attended by nearly 900 delegates from around the globe. The work of the congress dealt largely with matters of militarism, colonialism, and women's suffrage and marked an attempt to centrally coordinate the policies of the various socialist parties of the world on these issues. History=Convocation= The 1907 Congress of the Second International was convened on Sunday, 18 August 1907 at the Liederhalle of Stuttgart, Germany. There were a total of 886 delegates in attendance, representing the socialist parties of more than 25 nations, making it the largest such gathering in the history of the international socialist movement. The Congress was the seventh international conclave held by the Second International and the first since the Amsterdam Congress, which met three years earlier. Temporary chairman of the Congress was Paul Singer, who after welcoming the delegates turned the floor over to Emile Vandervelde of the International Socialist Bureau for a keynote speech which served as the formal opening of the gathering. Sunday night was occupied with a mass propaganda meeting, held at the Stuttgart Volksfestplatz, a large open area located on the banks of the Neckar River about a mile from the center of the city. For two hours prior to the start of the meeting a mass of humanity streamed into this military drill grounds, with the total crowd reaching between 50,000 and 100,000 people. The gathering was addressed by a series of leading orators of the international socialist movement and was held without incident. The formal work of the Congress began the morning of 19 August following another significant address, this delivered by veteran German socialist August Bebel. Bebel's keynote address dealt with a country-by-country report on the progress of the international socialist movement. Following Bebel's speech, a report on the work of the International Socialist Bureau ‚Äî the permanent executive structure of the Second International ‚Äî was delivered by the International Secretary, Camille Huysmans of Belgium. The actual work of the Congress was conducted in five select committees: Militarism, Colonialism, Woman Suffrage, Immigration, and the Relation of Trade Unions and Political Parties. Each country had the right to seat four of its members on each committee. This resulted in a set of large groups, likened by American delegate A.M. Simons to \\"miniature Congresses,\\" and made for a slow and methodical pace of work. Each speech was delivered in three languages, German, French, and English ‚Äî the original plus two translations. =Resolution on Militarism= French delegate Jean Jaur√®s, co-author of a radical minority draft resolution which called for general strike and armed uprising in the event of war. The main agenda item of the 1907 Congress was the construction of a unified policy to deal with what was seen as the growing menace of \\"militarism and international conflicts\\". Debate on the matter was held for five consecutive days in the commission named to decide the question, with a sixth day of debate taking place on the floor of the Congress. This was the most hotly contested topic of discussion, called by one observer \\"a royal battle, into which the European countries sent their best representatives\\". In the Militarism Commission there were three competing resolutions presented, including two by the French delegation and one by the German. The majority French draft noted the right of the working class to defend its national sovereignty in the event of invasion and proclaimed that war would cease only with the elimination of capitalism and its inherent need for the expansion of markets and the construction of military machine to bolster the territorial designs of the various nations. In contrast the majority French and German draft resolutions stood a third perspective held by Jean Jaur√®s and √âdouard Vaillant, which called for the working class to fight war through \\"every means available, from parliamentary intervention and public agitation to the general strike and the armed uprising\\" ‚Äî brazen language deemed \\"impossible and undiscussible\\" in German conditions by representatives of the recently legalized German Social- Democratic Party (SPD). This tense domestic situation faced by the SPD was accented by the expulsion of British delegate Harry Quelch by German authorities during the course of the Congress. Quelch, editor of the London socialist newspaper Justice, had referred to the 1907 Hague Peace Conference as a \\"thieves' supper\\" during the course of debate in Stuttgart. The government had taken offense to the insulting reference and had instructed Quelch to withdraw his statement or exit Germany within 8 hours. Faced with the choice, Quelch refused to accede to government pressure and he returned to London, where he was met at the train station with an ovation for his refusal to yield. After protracted debate suitable language was agreed upon for passage of a resolution by the Congress. War was declared to be the end product of the competition of capitalist nations in the world market, bolstered by \\"national prejudices systematically cultivated in the interests of the ruling classes\\". The resolution called for the replacement of standing armies by the democratic organization of \\"the armed people\\" ‚Äî which, it was claimed, \\"would prove an effective means for making aggressive wars impossible\\". In the event of imminent war, the working class was mildly beseeched to \\"do all they can to prevent the breaking out of this war, using for the purpose the means which appear to them most efficacious\\". Should war nevertheless follow, the socialists were \\"bound to intervene for its being brought to a speedy end\\" and to make use of the economic and political crises created by the war \\"to hasten the breakdown of the predominance of the capitalist class\\". =Resolution on Colonialism= British delegate Harry Quelch, expelled by the German government for making unflattering reference to the 1907 Hague Peace Conference as a \\"thieves' dinner.\\" The 1904 Amsterdam Congress instructed the various national socialist parties with which it was affiliated to form study groups in an effort to resolve the International's position towards the increasingly dynamic struggle of the various nations for control of colonial possessions around the world. A protracted period of discussion had followed and when the regularly scheduled August 1907 International Socialist Congress was convened in Stuttgart, Germany during the third week of August 1907, it was met with lengthy reports on the colonial policies of Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, each written by the respective socialist parties of these countries. A lengthy and divisive debate on the colonial question followed, occupying three full days of the Congress's time. One day of debate in commission produced a majority resolution which offered a carefully measured rejection of colonialism, while at the same time recognizing the inevitability of the opening of undeveloped nations for economic development and, by extension, exploitation. Unsatisfied by this attempt to simultaneously reject colonialism in principle while acknowledging its inevitability in practice, deep divisions emerged among the delegations of the major colonial powers, including Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy. A left wing, which included Karl Kautsky, Harry Quelch, and Julian Marchlewski (Karski), argued that a socialist colonial policy was a contradiction of terms and that the moderate resolution touted by Eduard Bernstein, H. H. van Kol, and Eduard David effectively endorsed external rule by force of colonial peoples. After protracted debate on the floor of the Congress the majority resolution out of committee was set aside in favor of a new resolution which declared that \\"capitalist colonial policies\\" must inevitably \\"give rise to servitude, forced labour, and the extermination of the native peoples,\\" while only the achievement of socialism would make possible \\"peaceful cultural development\\" and the prospect of developing \\"the world's mineral resources in the interests of the whole of humanity\\". Whatever fundamental differences in perspective existed among the delegates were thus papered over with utopian prose; the new colonial resolution was adopted unanimously. =Resolution on Women's Suffrage= A matter of little controversy was the International Socialist Congress's endorsement of woman suffrage, an idea advanced simultaneously in Stuttgart by a parallel First International Conference of Socialist Women ‚Äî a gathering held simultaneously in the same building. The Socialist Congress seconded the suffrage demands of the Socialist Women's Conference, with its resolution declaring it \\"the duty of Socialist Parties of all countries to agitate most energetically for the introduction of universal women's suffrage\\". While the resolution acknowledged that the International had no authority to dictate the launch of a suffrage campaign in any country, it nevertheless emphatically emphasized that whenever such a campaign was launched, socialists should proceed on the \\"general Social Democratic lines of universal adult suffrage without distinction, and nothing else\\". =Resolution on Immigration= With respect to immigration, the Socialist International felt pressure from the trade union movement to opine in favor of tight immigration restrictions which would reduce the ability of employers to make use of low cost newcomers in place of established union workers. The ultimate resolution did not go far in catering to such a demand, however, condemning the importation from abroad of strikebreakers or those previously entering into restrictive employment contracts, but insisting that unions not only admit immigrant workmen but do so on the basis of reasonable initiation fees and dues structures. This position proved acceptable to the radical foes of conservative craft unions and their \\"narrow, petty-bourgeois\\" agenda, such as Russian delegate V. I. Lenin, who asserted in no uncertain terms that the resolution adopted \\"fully meets the demands of revolutionary Social-Democracy\\". =Socialist Parties and Trade Unions= The Congress attempted to address the sometimes uneasy tension between the political and economic arms of the workers movement by defining the relationship between the Socialist Parties and the trade unions of the various nations of the world. In the words of the resolution adopted, the parties and the unions \\"had an equally important task to perform in the struggle for proletarian emancipation,\\" with the domain of each logically separated and independent of the other. Expressing the belief that only a combined economic and political effort would be sufficient for the liberation of the working class, pious wishes for close cooperation were made in the resolution, echoing the declarations of previous International Socialist Congresses. =Other resolutions= In addition to its major statements on militarism, immigration, the relationship of the socialist and trade union movements, colonialism, and women's suffrage, the 1907 Stuttgart Congress passed a handful of more specialized resolutions. The delegates approved declarations disapproving the invasion of Morocco by French and Spanish forces, expressed sympathy with the defeated revolutionary movement in the Russian Revolution of 1905, and formally condemned the \\"unlawful methods\\" employed by American mineowners in an effort to legally hang radical union leader William D. \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood. The delegates also condemned the actions of the government of Romania in using lethal violence in an effort to stamp out a mass peasant revolt in Moldavia and Wallachia.

Cazalot Jr. (born 1950) was president and chief executive of the Houston-based Marathon Oil Corporation. Since he took over control of the company in 2002, Marathon has expanded abroad with investments in the nascent gas industry of Equatorial Guinea and oil in Gabon, Libya and Norway.Marathon's first investment in Equatorial Guinea was in 2001: * Its upstream earnings from overseas projects have been tripled and Marathon is beginning to sell off the smaller assets. A trained geologist, Cazalot doesn't come from a tycoon background and spent much of his career doing technical work for Texaco. However, he benefited from the decades of experience in offshore drilling and, particularly, in laying pipelines, getting three high- profile roles managing Texaco's international production divisions. After joining Marathon in 2000, he quickly improved the company's bargaining situation with a somewhat cooperative approach to developing energy markets and pricing, instead putting a strategic focus on technology. Throughout his career, Cazalot has financed acquisitions of foreign supplies by creating good relationships with research facilities and lowering production costs rather than seeking international lending. His corporate focus is now on gas commercialization, and while it has to deliver the company any \\"breakthrough\\" technologies, he has had a great deal of success in the past with oil completion technologies. Marathon's subsidiary, Marathon Ashland Petroleum, is today the fifth largest petroleum refiner in the United States. It has also improved the company's debt-position and made Cazalot an immensely wealthy man. He earned a reported $6.5 million in compensation in 2008, making him nominally one of the highest paid executives in Houston. He is a member of the board of Baker Hughes and the Oil and Natural Gas Industry Labor-Management Committee. He is a general member of the Council on Competitiveness, the exclusive All-American Wildcatters Association, a number of other industry associations, and several local business groups in the Greater Houston area. Early life Cazalot was born in New Orleans. He received a bachelor's degree in geology from Louisiana State University. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in May 2007 from Louisiana State University. Career=Texaco= Cazalot entered the oil business less than one year after graduating from university when he was contracted by Texaco as a geophysicist in 1972, doing testing on offshore oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico. He worked for the company's exploration division for almost twenty years in various positions. Cazalot's first major promotion was to the Coral Gables, Florida office in 1992, being elected a vice president of Texaco and serving as president of the Latin America/West Africa (LA/WA) division. He succeeded C. Robert \\"Bob\\" Black, who had been with the company for thirty-four years. It was from this office that Cazalot brokered his first oil export deals with European countries. Cazalot was involved in a series of projects in the marketing and exploration divisions from 1994 through 1997, before deciding to return to management. Texaco had announced a restructuring program in July 1994 which it expected would see about 2,500 jobs cut over the next year. Cazalot assumed the presidency of the company's exploration division in March to oversee its reorganization, and handle the first of the job cuts, in September. He decided to consolidate the domestic exploration and production offices into four regional subdivisions, down from seven; most jobs were cut in New Orleans and Denver. The Houston office was made responsible for support functions, such as general accounting and paying out royalties, which had previously been performed at field offices stretching from Midland, Ohio to Denver to Bakersfield, California. Cazalot was promoted to a position in the Middle East, bearing the title \\"President for international production in Europe, Eurasia and the Middle East\\", in December 1997. In the 1999 restructuring, he was promoted to a third position, bearing the title \\"President of international production operations\\". =President of Marathon= Upon leaving Texaco in late 1999, Cazalot joined USX Corporation and Marathon Oil, serving as president of Marathon from March 2000 until 2001.Clarence P. Cazalot , Forbes.com Cazalot's first major investment was into oil and gas properties in Equatorial Guinea. A \\"syndicate of underwriters\\" helped the company raise a billion dollars in long-term debt at low rates to finance the acquisition. It was the largest borrowing Marathon had ever underwritten and, because it was repaid so quickly, cemented the company's reputation for conservative financial strategies. =CEO of Marathon= Cazalot succeeded George A. Manos as CEO of Marathon on January 1, 2002, when USX's steel and energy businesses separated. In his first year, he more than quadrupled net income by increasing production, while cutting $150 million worth of exploration and production costs. In September 2003 the company was restructured. Around 265 jobs were cut and its domestic offices were consolidated into two business units, Northern and Southern. William Schwind, vice president of Marathon, retired in August 2009. As with Cazalot, the board named him vice president after the corporate separation. Cazalot described him as \\"an essential element\\" of Marathon's success. As CEO of Marathon in 2009, Cazalot earned a total compensation of $6,571,194, which included a base salary of $1,400,000, a cash bonus of $2,100,000, options granted of $2,845,791, and other compensation of $225,403.2009 CEO Compensation for Clarence P.

Biography  Martin Knutzen was born in K√∂nigsberg (the present Kaliningrad) in 1713. Knutzen studied philosophy, mathematics and physics at the University of K√∂nigsberg (the present Kaliningrad), gaining his M.A. degree in 1733 with Dissertatio metaphysica de aeternitate mundi impossibili and becoming a Professor Extraordinary of logic and metaphysics there in 1735 on the basis of his 1734 doctoral thesis Commentatio de commercio mentis et corporis per influxum physicum. A follower of Christian Wolff, in the rationalist school, Knutzen was also interested in natural sciences, and taught physics, astronomy and mathematics, besides philosophy. The study of the doctrines of Newton induced him to question Leibniz' and Wolff's theory of pre-established harmony, defending the concept of mechanical causality in the movement of physical objects; his lessons on the matter would influence the later work of Kant, who sought to reconcile the autonomy of the spiritual with the reality of the mechanical in the Critique of Judgement. Knutzen would be an important figure in the formation of his K√∂nigsberg University students Immanuel Kant and Johann Georg Hamann (proponent of the Sturm und Drang literary movement). Knutzen died in K√∂nigsberg in 1751. = Influence on Kant = As a young extraordinary professor at the University of K√∂nigsberg, Knutzen, who had a strong personality, influenced Kant strongly during the latter's studies, planting in him the seed of philosophy and sciences.The exposition here draws on (Beck, 1960) (Erdmann, 1973) (Kuehn, 2001). Kant kept in close contact with Knutzen. Knutzen introduced him to the study of mechanics and optics, besides discussing faith extensively. Knutzen's ample private library on natural sciences constituted an invaluable resource for the writing of the first treatise of Kant, Thoughts on the True Estimation of Vital Forces (Gedanken von der wahren Sch√§tzung der lebendigen Kr√§fte), a mathematical text, and exerted a powerful influence on Kant's thought. It was Knutzen who introduced Kant to the scientific literature of the era and especially the works of Isaac Newton, who had such a powerful influence on the development of Kant's own philosophy. Knutzen, however, did not consider Kant to be one of his best students, and favoured (1722‚Äì1786) or Johann Friedrich Weitenkampf (1726‚Äì1758). Moreover, the name of Kant never appeared in the profuse correspondence between Knutzen and Leonhard Euler, which is evidence of in what little esteem Knutzen held Kant. Knutzen was 10 years Kant's senior and reached professorship at the early age of 21 years. His advancedness did not, however, lead him on to greater responsibilities. External pressures prevented him from ever receiving an ordinary professorship. Like his disciple Kant, Knutzen led a life removed from worldly noise and dedicated to study. His sedentarism meant that he never ventured more than thirty miles from his native town of K√∂nigsberg. On 29 January 1751, Flottwell wrote that although Knutzen had inherited first 10,000 then a further 15,000 Thaler, \\"this philosopher was always in a bad mood, had no social contacts and lived in absolute isolation\\". Only three days after Flottwell wrote this, Knutzen was dead (Kuehn, 2001). Indeed, his temperament, given as he was to impetuousness and academic overexertion, brought his life to an early end at the age of 37 years. At the time of his death, he enjoyed a magnificent reputation and was greatly admired by his students, among whom he numbered Kant. Knutzen acquainted Kant with both the latest scientific advances and discoveries and British empiricism. Knutzen's widow remarried a close friend of Kant's, a doctor of jurisprudence and young lawyer, Johann Daniel Funk (1721‚Äì1764). Kant felt quite at home with Funk, and they kept in close contact with each other. Funk had an extremely fascinating personality and led what one might describe as an exceedingly dissolute life. He gave lectures on jurisprudence and, as Hippet said (Borowski, 1804), \\"Precisely because he could live without the income from his lectures, Funk was by far the best of the professors (Magister). Even at that time it was evident to me that gentlemen that had other income had one or more concubines apart from their official spouse. My dear old Funk, who had married the widow of professor Knutzen, a very famous person at the time, did not deprive himself of other diversions apart from the conjugal act, but his lectures were as chaste as the bed of an elegy\\".  Thought  Knutzen sought to strike a balance between Pietist Lutheranism and Christian Wolff's dogmatic philosophy, trying to compatibilize the teachings of Pietism with the hypotheses of Wolff's illustrated philosophy. Knutzen saw philosophy not merely as a propaedeutic for gaining access to theology, but as a separate science that established its own postulates. This is patent from one of his writings, published in 1740, the year in which Kant joined the university, titled ‚ÄúPhilosophical Proof of the Truth of the Christian Religion‚Äù (Knutzen, 1740). This volume, which was to become his most famous work and built him a reputation in the 18th century, stated that philosophy is the depository of rational proof, even of religion itself. In writing this book, not only did Knutzen show how strongly rooted his thinking was in K√∂nigsberg's theological debate, but he also revealed his intimate knowledge of what had until then been an unknown aspect of British philosophy. The book also offers a good picture of Knutzen's theological standpoint. This work originally appeared as a series of articles in the ‚ÄúK√∂nigsberger Intelligenzbl√§tter‚Äù (Knutzen, 1745). This way, Knutzen brought a breath of fresh, modern and advanced air into the Prussian cultural milieu dominated by Franz Albert Schultz‚Äôs Pietist theology. Philosophically speaking, Knutzen took an anti-Leibnizian standpoint, sustaining that the theory of pre- established harmony was as wrong, just like occasionalism, and that the only reasonable theory was that of physical influx, as suggested by Locke and corpuscularism. In fact, Leibniz‚Äô theory of pre-established harmony in its strictest form was unacceptable for Knutzen on theological grounds. There were also differences and controversy between what Knutzen, Kant, Leibniz, Descartes and Newton thought about the concept of living force, dead pressure and momentum. And yet again, Newton was right in the end. Accordingly, Knutzen's standpoints were closer to British than German philosophers. A similar thing can be said about his epistemology. Indeed, death surprised him when he was translating Locke's treatise entitled Of the Conduct of the Understanding. In 1744, an important controversy shook the scientific and academic media of the time. Years earlier, in 1738, Knutzen had predicted that a comet that had been observed in 1698 would reappear in the winter of 1744. This prediction was, apparently, based on Newton's theory about the course of periodic comets with elliptical orbits of the Sun. (Waschkies, 1987). When a comet actually did appear in that year, Knutzen became an instant celebrity in the town and gained a reputation as a great astronomer well beyond the confines of K√∂nigsberg. In 1744, Knutzen published a book titled ‚ÄúRational thoughts on the comets, in which is examined and represented their nature and their character, as well as the causes of their motion, and at the same time given a short description of the noteworthy comet of this year‚Äù. This book was, according to (1753‚Äì1807), Kant's most intelligent disciple, responsible for awakening Kant's interest in this science, and it was this book that led him to write his own ‚ÄúUniversal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens‚Äù (Kant, 1755), which appeared eleven years later. Like other students, Kant may have viewed Knutzen as a hero. However, doubts were soon raised and by none other than the great and prolific mathematician, Leonhard Euler. In fact, Euler showed, in letters to Knutzen and in an article that appeared at the end of 1744, that Knutzen's prediction had not come true. The reason was clear: the 1744 comet was not identical to the 1698 comet. This meant that Knutzen did not know enough physics (Waschkies, 1987). Euler sustained that it would be at least four to five hundred years before the 1698 comet could be seen again. But this refutation did not seem to matter much to most of the people of K√∂nigsberg and even less so to Knutzen and his students. They never acknowledged that their master's prediction had been wrong. In fact, in a poem written for the occasion of Knutzen's burial, he was compared with Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, Locke and Boyle. Knutzen's work on comets was in any case largely motivated by theological concerns. It was written in part as a response to a tract, penned by Johann Heyn and entitled ‚ÄúAttempt of a Consideration of the Comet, the Deluge and the Prelude of the Final Judgement; in Accordance with Astronomical Reasons and the Bible‚Ä¶‚Äù, which appeared in Berlin and Leipzig in 1742. Heyn argued that the fear of comets as a bad omen was well founded. Knutzen, referencing Newton, objected to this view and concluded that Heyn was an alarmist and obscurantist. In return, Heyn accused Knutzen of plagiarism, as the prediction had been made a year earlier in the ‚ÄúLeipziger Gelehrte Anzeigen‚Äù. He also suggested that Knutzen had not sufficiently proved the respective identities of the 1698 and 1744 comets. Knutzen and his students ignored Heyn's reference to Euler, just as they did Euler's original criticism. Knutzen's understanding of scientific and mathematical matters was inadequate for advancing the discussion of the more technical aspects of physics. Knutzen did not belong to that ‚Äúsmall elite‚Äù of scientists on the continent who understood the details of Newtonian physics. His knowledge of calculus was far from perfect. Relying more on mechanical models than on rigorous calculations, he had some understanding of Newton's Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica but was unable to make any original contribution to science. Nor was he willing to draw a sharp line between science and metaphysics. Theological and apologetic concerns dictated what was and was not acceptable at least as much as scientific views did. As a scientist, he was rather limited even by 18th century standards. Of Knutzen it was said that, as a student, he approached not the Aristotelians but ‚Äúthe men who were qualified enough to be able to instruct him in the most recent philosophy, mathematics‚Äù. Knutzen taught himself calculus and appears to have studied algebra from Wolf's work in Latin (Buck, 1768). Although perhaps Knutzen's most important contribution to mathematics, or, to be more precise, number theory, is more of a historical sort. In fact, Knutzen, in his exceptional essay entitled ‚ÄúVon dem Wahren Auctore der Arithmeticae Binariae, ‚Ä¶‚Äù, in English ‚ÄúOn the True Author of Binary Arithmetic, also known as Leibniz‚Äô Dyadic‚Äù (Knutzen, 1742), rightly claims that the binary number system credited by many, including the man himself, to Leibniz, was actually attributable to the Spanish bishop Juan Caramuel de Lobkowitz (Caramuel, 1670), and outlined in the ‚ÄúMeditatio Proemialis‚Äù of his work, entitled, true to the Baroque style of the time, ‚ÄúMathesis b√≠ceps vetrus et nova. In omnibus, et singulis veterum, et recientorum placita examinantur; interdum corriguntur, semper dilucidantur‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Life Clint was born in Brownlow Street, Drury Lane, Covent Garden, London, the son of Michael Clint, a hairdresser in Lombard Street. He went to school in Yorkshire and was then apprenticed to a fishmonger, but left after a violent dispute with his employer. He found alternative employment in an attorney's office, but took exception to the work and became a house-painter instead - one of his jobs was painting the stones of the arches in the nave of Westminster Abbey. He also decorated the exterior of a house built by Sir Christopher Wren in Cheapside, and was later employed by the bookseller Thomas Tegg. He married the daughter of a small farmer in Berkshire; they had five sons and four daughters. His wife died a fortnight after giving birth to their son Alfred, who also became an artist. Clint took up miniature painting. He had a studio in Leadenhall Street, and he became acquainted with the publisher John Bell, whose nephew, the mezzotint engraver Edward Bell, taught Clint the art of engraving. His first in oil painting was a portrait of his wife. At this period Samuel Reynolds, the engraver, advised him to undertake watercolour portraits. Commissions proving scarce, he made copies, in colour, from prints after George Morland and Teniers; he reproduced Morland's The Enraged Bull and The Horse struck by Lightning several times. Around 1816, his studio at 83 Gower Street, was a meeting place of the leading actors and actresses of the day. This popularity arose from a series of dramatic scenes which he painted, such as \\"William Farren, Farley, and Jones as Lord Ogleby, Canton, and Brush\\" in the comedy The Clandestine Marriage. Clint was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1821, a position he resigned in 1836, after repeated disappointments in not being made a full academician. He subsequently took a house in Peckham, but moved to Pembroke Square, where he died on 10 May 1864. Works Falstaff relating his valiant exploits, c. mid‚Äì1830s He painted portraits of Lord Suffield and his family, Lord Egremont, Lord Essex, Lord Spencer, General Wyndham, and many others. He executed several theatrical portraits for a Mrs. Griffiths of Norwood, some of which were destroyed by fire. His Falstaff and Mistress Ford is in the Tate Gallery. His early engravings include The Frightened Horse, after George Stubbs; The Entombment, after Dietrich; The Death of Nelson, after Samuel Drummond, and a set of the Raphael cartoons in outline. His mezzotints included The Trial of Queen Caroline, after George Henry Harlow; a portrait of the William Pitt, after John Hoppner; a portrait of Margaret, Lady Dundas, after Thomas Lawrence; a portrait of Miss Siddons, again after Lawrence, and a print after a self- portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. There are also portraits of the engraver George Cook; the publisher John Bell; the actors Edmund Kean, Charles Young (as Hamlet), William Dowton and John Liston (the latter as Paul Pry) and the actresses Lucia Elizabeth Vestris and Julia Glover. Family One of Clint's sons, Scipio Clint, was a notable medallist and seal engraver. Of his other sons Raphael Clint (1797‚Äì1849) was an engraver and Alfred Clint (1807‚Äì1833) a marine painter.

The modern diocese is divided into four archdeaconries: the archdeacon of Exeter supervises clergy and buildings within the area of the Archdeaconry of Exeter. History The first recorded archdeacon of Exeter occurs in 1083, around the time when archdeacons were first appointed in Britain. Around that time, the Diocese of Exeter was divided into four archdeaconries: Exeter, Cornwall, Totnes (or Totton) and Barnstaple (or Barum). This configuration of archdeaconries within the diocese remained for almost 800 years, until the creation of the independent Diocese of Truro from the Cornwall archdeaconry. On 22 March 1918, the archdeaconries were reconfigured and the Archdeaconry of Plymouth created from Totnes archdeaconry. Presently, the diocese operates an informal 'area scheme' such that responsibility for roughly half the diocese is delegated to each suffragan bishop: special oversight is given to the Bishop of Crediton for the Barnstaple and Exeter archdeaconries and to the Bishop of Plymouth for the Plymouth and Totnes archdeaconries.Diocese of Exeter ‚Äì Vacancy in the Suffragan See of Crediton List of archdeacons=High medieval= Sole (or primary) archdeacons of the diocese *?‚Äì28 June 1083 (d.): Odo *?‚Äì11 March 1104 (d.): Rolamnus *aft. 1103‚Äì11 August 1107 (res.): William WarelwastOxford Dictionary of National Biography ‚Äì Warelwast, William de :During (or possibly before) the episcopacy of William Warelwast (1107‚Äì1137), the other three archdeaconries were instituted.

Plot A Girl from Hunan tells the story of a willful young girl (initially played by Lin Qing and played as an adult by Naren Hua) who, at the start of the film, is about to enter into an arranged marriage with a two-year-old child, Chun Guan. Xiao Xiao, the girl in question, is only twelve. Left by her uncle in this remote village, Xiao Xiao is expected to be less of a wife than a mother to her new husband and lives under the domineering control of her mother-in-law. Now sixteen, Xiao Xiao catches the eye of a farmhand, Hua Gou (played by Deng Xiaoguang). She lets herself be seduced by him and soon finds herself pregnant. Knowing that the traditional village still executes women for adultery, Xiao Xiao is desperate to abort the baby but fails to accomplish her goal. With her pregnancy clear, Xiao Xiao faces the wrath of her mother-in-law, only to be saved by the appeal of her young husband, who has grown to love his wife, though perhaps more as a mother-figure than a spouse.

He was a champion for the poor and defended the rights and privileges of the Church against secular intervention though this was a cause for his exile from his diocese. He returned not long after his exile and set himself on the construction of a new cathedral which was still in construction at the time he died. His canonization was celebrated on 24 March 1247. Life Tomb. Guillaume Pinchon was born circa 1175 in Saint-Alban to the peasants Oliver Pinchon and Jane Fortin. He first studied in Saint-Brieuc where he received the minor orders and he served as an aide to three bishops - later his three immediate predecessors in the diocese. He first served as a canon for the Tours Cathedral after Bishop Josselin ordained him to the priesthood. Pinchon was appointed as the Bishop of Saint-Brieuc in 1220. He was known for his staunch defense of Church rights against secular intervention and was a champion of the poor. In 1225 he sold all his possessions in a famine to aid the poor and homeless. The duke Peter I forced him into a brief exile in 1228 and he spent that time living for a while in Poitiers before he returned to his diocese in 1230 after the duke reconciled with Pope Gregory IX. It was during his exile in Poitiers that he assisted the ill bishop there and helped him in his ecclesial duties. The bishop was noted for his meekness and for his self-mortifications. He slept on bare boards despite the poor making a soft and comfortable one for him and also borrowed corn often to help the poor who starved. He died in 1234 and his remains were later discovered in 1236 to be incorrupt. His relics were burned sometime during the French Revolution.

The screenplay was by John Kohn, with music by Bill Conti. The film is the screen debut of Susan Anton, who starred in the title role opposite James Coburn. Plot A scientist and neo-Nazi doctor named Serafin has developed a way to create a physically superior human being. He tests it out on his adopted daughter, Goldine. From childhood, Goldine's father has injected her with vitamins and hormones. Now that she is grown, it is time to give her a test run. Serafin declares that his \\"Goldengirl\\" will enter and win three races at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. To subsidize his work, Serafin sells shares in his daughter's future to a syndicate of businessmen, who send merchandising expert Dryden to look out for their interests. Goldine's personal and emotional development, meanwhile, is left in the hands of a psychologist, Dr. Sammy Lee. Goldine competes in Moscow, with unexpected results.

She was best known for starring and singing in TV commercials for Muriel Cigars. Anton earned a 1980 Golden Globe nomination for Best New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture‚ÄîFemale. Olympic track-and-field stars Dwight Stones and Bob Beamon make cameo appearances in the film, as does Australian tennis player John Newcombe. The film raised two-thirds of its $7 million budget by pre-selling the TV rights; NBC planned to broadcast an expanded 184-minute, two-part miniseries version that would air in conjunction with the network's exclusive coverage of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. After US participation was canceled in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, NBC postponed the broadcast until January 8, 1981 when it aired a 117-minute version in a three-hour timeslot. Reaction Vincent Canby of The New York Times, called the film \\"a very intelligent movie of its kind, written and directed in the same brisk style that marked Mr. Sargent's earlier Colossus: The Forbin Project,\\" as well as \\"a wittily conceived and executed movie that, with the straightest of faces, manage to satirize the kind of big business that surrounds so-called amateur sports today.\\"Canby, Vincent (June 15, 1979). \\"Screen: A Witty 'Goldengirl': Nurtured to Win\\". The New York Times. C10. A review in Variety said, \\"'Goldengirl' is amusingly poor ... Central fault to film is Anton's character, who seems to alternate between robot, country girl and schizophrenic. Her screen debut is at best, forgettable, with Anton doing little to clear up the mystifying script.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Goldengirl\\". Variety. June 20, 1970. 18. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1 star out of 4 and wrote, \\"The idea isn't a bad one; it's even plausible. But the script is laughable. The doctor and businessman are fearful, cartoon figures; they never are particularly slick or menacing. Only James Coburn as an advertising agent brings any credibility to a role. And this is not accomplished by anything written for Coburn; he simply earns our good will through his infectious smile.\\"Siskel, Gene (July 23, 1979). \\"No shiny medals for a laughable 'Goldengirl'\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 5. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"starts out promisingly enough but falls apart halfway through ... The film is extremely uneven, achieving a punchy scene here and there only to have its effect nullified by an unintentionally funny line of dialogue or an inconsistent characterization.\\"Thomas, Kevin (September 14, 1979). \\"No Second Wind for 'Goldengirl'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 32. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that \\"the continuity is so punchy that one can't be certain what the filmmakers wanted the story to mean. The smartest lines and most effective situations suggest an entertaining polemic about unscrupulous, ruinous exploitation. But the concept seems to have been victimized by a combination of cold feet, cross-purposes and desperate last-minute editing, which eliminated substantial pieces of exposition along with one major player, Jessica Walter, who is still listed in the credits.\\"Arnold, Gary (July 25, 1979). \\"Bombshell and the Bomb‚Äî'Goldengirl'\\" The Washington Post. B1. Jack Kroll wrote in Newsweek, \\"Goldengirl fumbles a good story idea, or several good story ideas ... A film that might have had the excitement of Olympic competition and the fun of clever science-fiction founders in dump scenes, Joseph Sargent's heavy-handed direction and some awkward editing which apparently eliminated a pivotal scene showing Serafin's background in Nazi-like medical experimentation.\\"Kroll, Jack (July 9, 1979). \\"Trials of a Human Robot\\".

It is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit grassroots organization working to inform citizens and empower them to support viable renewable energy projects and policies. Their belief is that new energy projects, combined with efficiency and conservation efforts will bring about a clean, healthy environment, an improved economy, and a more secure, sustainable world. The organization‚Äôs immediate focus is to increase citizen support of offshore wind power in Nantucket Sound, namely the Cape Wind Project. Cape Wind is proposing America‚Äôs first offshore wind farm on Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound. Over from the nearest shore, 130 wind turbines will use the wind to produce a peak 420 megawatts of power. In average winds, Cape Wind will provide three quarters of the energy required for the Cape and Islands. History Clean Power Now was formed in 2003 after an opposition group, The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound was formed against the Cape Wind project proposed in 2001. The first Executive Director, Matt Palmer, served for two years until in 2006 Barbara Hill, who served as project coordinator for Offshore Wind with the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative for three and a half years, assumed the role as Executive Director from Matt Palmer and remains there today.  Media  Clean Power Now is the primary advocate for the construction of the Cape Wind Project and is an active participant in public hearings, media coverage of the project, and in documentaries. In 2007, The Daily Show reporter Jason Jones featured Clean Power Now and Executive Director Barbara Hill as a part of his special on the Cape Wind Issue. Cape Spin: An American Power Struggle is a feature-length documentary written, produced, and directed by Robbie Gemmel and Daniel Coffin of Rebirth Productions in association with Sundance Channel.

Construction Problems Since late 2010, panes of balcony glass have shattered and fallen to the street below. An occurrence on one of Toronto's hottest days on record (6 July 2012) resulted in the closure of Grosvenor Street and St. Vincent Lane.

Police closed the northbound lane of Bay between Grosvenor and Grenville Streets, expecting the closure to be for a week.

Cornblatt is Professor of Psychiatry and Molecular Medicine at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine. She is known for her research on serious mental disorders, with a specific focus on psychosis and schizophrenia. Her efforts to find treatments to help youth with mental illness led to the development of the Recognition and Prevention Program, which she founded in 1998. Cornblatt was awarded the Joseph Zubin Memorial Fund Award in 1996. She served as President of the Society for Research in Psychopathology (2000-2001).  Biography  Cornblatt received an MBA degree in Industrial Psychology at Baruch College, City University of New York in 1977 and a Ph.D in Experimental Psychology from New School University in 1978. Cornblatt's research program, including projects focusing on cognitive behavioral social skills training for youth at risk of psychosis, predictors and mechanisms of conversion to psychosis, and characterization of prodromal schizophrenia, has been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health. She worked on North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS-1), a large multisite longitudinal study focusing on the earliest stages of psychotic illness, with prominent clinical psychologists and psychiatrists including Tyrone Cannon, Elaine F. Walker, and Thomas McGlashan.  Research  Towards a Psychosis Risk Blood Diagnostic for Persons Experiencing High-Risk Symptoms: In this study, the researchers looked at different analytes found in human blood plasma. These plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism. It was discovered that individuals who are at a high-risk for psychosis have high levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormone imbalances. Cortisol Level and Risk for Psychosis: Researchers tested the cortisol contents of saliva in 256 individuals. It was discovered that patients that were at a higher risk of psychosis, or already had the diagnosis, had increased cortisol levels. This study suggests the need for future research focusing on the hormone levels of individuals with, or at risk of, psychosis. Functional development in clinical high risk youth: Prediction of schizophrenia versus other psychotic disorders: This study was a follow up study involving participants from the NAPLS-1 study. Researchers checked for three different signs in their patients: psychosis-risk symptoms present at baseline (these plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism), onset of psychosis during the two and a half-year follow-along period of NAPLS-1, and psychotic disorder diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The study showed that people in early adolescence who showed poor social indicators were four times as likely to develop schizophrenia. Those in their late adolescence with poor social indicators were five times as likely to develop schizophrenia.  Representative Publications  * Cornblatt, B. A., Auther, A. M., Niendam, T., Smith, C.

He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football for West Virginia University. Early life Capers was born in Metairie, Louisiana and attended St. Augustine High School in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was an All- Louisiana tight end. As a senior, he recorded twenty-one catches for 1176 yards and four touchdowns, which earned him first team all-district, all-metro and all-state honors. He was also a three-year starter on the basketball team. Capers and D'Andre Crittenden were the only boys to start three years in football and basketball. Considered only a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Capers was not ranked among the nation's top offensive line prospects in 2005, due to his tightend status. He chose West Virginia over Southern Miss, among others. College career Capers redshirted his initial year at West Virginia, and saw limited time at tight end in 2006. During the offseason, he moved from tight end to the tackle position, where he started the 2007 season as the backup. He then earned the starting job against Mississippi State and kept it the rest of his college career. Overall, he played in all 13 games and started six during his sophomore year. Capers anchored an offensive line that helped pave the way for the Mountaineers offense to produce two 1,000-yard rushers in Steve Slaton and Pat White. He saw limited action in West Virginia's appearance in the 2008 Fiesta Bowl, due to a sprained ankle. As a junior in 2008, Capers started all 13 games and saw action in more than 775 plays, including a season high 86 against Cincinnati. He collected 56 knockdowns, including a season high eight knockdowns against Connecticut. During his senior season, Capers was named Second Team All-Big East Conference in a poll by the conference's head coaches. Professional career Capers was projected to be a second or third round draft pick until he under-achieved in the Senior Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine. =Washington Redskins= He was drafted by the Redskins in the seventh round (231st overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft.

On 7 May 1942, in the opening phase of the Battle of the Coral Sea, Neosho and her escorting destroyer, USS Sims (DD-409), were attacked by three waves of Japanese carrier planes after the Japanese mistook Neosho for an aircraft carrier and Sims for an escorting cruiser.

The case consolidated one of the three current methods by which an easement can be acquired by implied grant. It was little altered by subsequent case law by 1925 but has been further consolidated by section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925. Both types of implied grant are widely excluded in agreements by sellers of part and to some extent other transferors of part, so that the retained land can be developed subject to general and local planning law constraints. Facts Mr Tetley owned a piece of land and a workshop in Derby, which had windows overlooking and receiving light from the first piece of land. He sold the workshop to Mr Burrows, and the piece of land to Mr Wheeldon. Mr Wheeldon's widow (Mrs Wheeldon, the plaintiff) built on the piece of land, and it obstructed the windows of Mr Burrows' workshop. In response, Mr Burrows dismantled Mrs Wheeldon's construction, asserting an easement over the light passing through Wheeldon's lot. Mrs Wheeldon brought an action in trespass.

The street continues north as Trinity Street and then St John's Street, and south as Trumpington Street. It is a major tourist area in Cambridge, commanding a central position in the University of Cambridge area of the city. It is also a place frequented by many cyclists and by students travelling between lectures during term-time. King's College is located on the west side of the street, hence the name, and dominates the scene with the east end of its large Chapel on view. Also on the street, just to the north, is the University of Cambridge Senate House, mainly used for degree ceremonies. This area is known as Senate House Hill. Opposite the Senate House is Great St Mary's, the historic University Church. History Photograph of King's Parade circa 1870, showing shops on the east side The White Horse Tavern,Friaries: Austin friars, Cambridge on King's Lane to the west of King's Parade, was a 16th-century meeting place for English Protestant reformers to discuss Lutheran ideas, from as early as 1521.J. D. Mackie, The Earlier Tudors, 1485‚Äì1558, Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 343. When the King's College screen was extended in 1870, the tavern was demolished. There is now a blue plaque in the college's Chetwynd Court to commemorate this. Bowes & Bowes was a bookseller and publishing company located at 1 Trinity Street (at the south end of the street), a corner position at the junction with King's Parade and St Mary's Street to the east. It has a claim to be the oldest bookshop in the United Kingdom, with books having been sold on the site since 1581.History of the Bookshop, Cambridge University Press. The shop closed in 1986 and subsequently Sherratt & Hughes closed in 1992, since when the site has become the Cambridge University Press bookshop. When the King's College Gatehouse (porters' lodge) and Screen were built in the 1830s, the previous west side of the street was completely demolished. Opposite King's College is a row of now mainly touristic shops. For example, the Primavera Gallery and gift store is located here. St Mary's Passage and St Edward's Passage lead away from King's Parade to the east. No.1 King's Parade on the corner or King's Parade and Bene't Street was a milliner & dressmaker by the name of C.H. Lawrence in the early 20th century. In the 1950s and 1960s the building became Millers Wine Parlour. In Ted Hughes: The Life of A Poet by Elaine Feinstein, Syliva Plath is described sitting in Millers Wine parlour in 1956, reading a review article. Since then it has occupied various establishments including the wine bars Gough Bros (1972) and Shades (1972-1992), The English Teddy Bear Company (late 1990s - early 2000s) and a restaurant/bar by the name of No.1 King's Parade (until 2006). Today a restaurant called The Cambridge Chop House is located here. In the 1970s, Chris Curry rented offices at 6 King's Parade to establish Sinclair Instrument Ltd with Sir Clive Sinclair. In 1977, the company was renamed to Science of Cambridge Ltd. The name Sinclair Research Ltd was adopted in 1981. The company was important in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s in the UK.

The signal is sometimes referred to in car manufacturers' manuals as an optical horn, since it draws the attention of other drivers. The signal can be intended to convey a variety of messages, including a warning to other drivers of road hazards, telling a driver they can pass through or alerting a driver of speed traps, and it can also be a form of aggressive driving. The legality of headlight flashing varies by jurisdiction. History Headlight flashing might have come into more common use as a means of attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column‚Äîtypically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk‚Äîrather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off. Uses Headlight flashing attracts attention, and so can be considered the visual equivalent of blowing the horn. Indeed, some car owner's manuals identify headlight control on the steering column as the \\"optical horn\\". Like the horn, it has many uses. Headlight flashing can let other drivers know of one's presence. Flashing can acknowledge the presence or actions of other drivers. Flashing can be a signal that the flashing driver is yielding the right of way, for example at an intersection controlled by stop signs. Flashing can warn other drivers of road dangers, such as crashed cars or police speed traps. Flashing can be used to give thanks. For example, when one is warned of police activity, it is sometimes considered courteous to flash back. Flashing can inform drivers of problems with their car, such as headlamps left off after dark, burned out or misaligned lights, or misuse of high beam rather than low beam in traffic; or to berate a driver who poses a risk to traffic. Headlight flashing coupled with blowing the car's horn can help clear deer from a driver's path. Flashing can indicate the intention to overtake or pass another driver, or to signal a driver who has just overtaken that he or she can now return to the original lane. Flashing can request or insist that a leading driver speed up or change lanes to get out of the way of a faster following driver. Headlight flashing may constitute aggressive driving, and can be used in an attempt to intimidate others into speeding or otherwise driving unsafely. Some drivers attempt to communicate \\"I will continue my current behavior!\\" when flashing their headlights. For example, if such a driver flashes his or her headlights while slowing down, they intend to communicate to another driver who is waiting to merge in traffic: \\"Go on, I will let you merge!\\" On the other hand, if such a driver keeps his or her current speed and flashes headlights, they intend to communicate \\"Stay back, I am not slowing down!\\" Headlight flashing may also indicate protest or celebration of an event or political position. Motorcycle headlamp modulators automatically oscillate the intensity of the headlamp in an effort to make the motorcycle more conspicuous to other drivers. Effectiveness and ambiguity  Headlight flashing as an effective mode of driver communication has been questioned, and researchers have found the ability of drivers to communicate with one another is about the same as the communication abilities among insects. Flashed headlamps can have ambiguous or contradictory meanings, with no way for the observing driver to tell for sure what the flashing driver is trying to say. It may mean, for example, that the flashing driver intends to yield the right of way, or instead that he intends to take it. Misinterpretation of the flashing driver's intent can cause crashes. Legality and meaning=Australia= Headlight flashing to warn drivers of traffic enforcement cameras is illegal in the state of Queensland, carrying a $30 fine and one demerit point, or a $1500 fine if the fine is unsuccessfully challenged in court. Officers may either fine a driver for improper use of headlights, or may even arrest and prosecute for hindering police. In the state of New South Wales, headlight flashing by regular drivers (that is, not a police officer, etc.) for any reason is illegal, except in emergency purposes and immediately before overtaking. In Victoria, Traffic Superintendent Dean McWhirter has said he is happy for motorists to flash their lights to warn other motorists they were approaching a speed camera in 2013. =Bangladesh= Headlight flashing is common in Bangladesh, where roads are sometimes narrow and lane discipline is lax. It is done by large vehicles such as buses or trucks to alert smaller, more maneuverable vehicles to their presence and to encourage them to make way, for example by moving to the side of the road. =Canada= In Ontario, the Highway Traffic Act does not prohibit \\"flashing head beams\\". Some have brought tickets to court, claiming the law only regulates the use of alternating lights in an attempt to impersonate emergency and law enforcement vehicles, and not a driver's manually flashing his car's headlamps to communicate with other drivers. The section that deals with alternating headlights in Ontario is Section 169 of the Highway Traffic Act. It is an offence to improperly use high-beams at night, which is dealt with by way of section 168 of the Highway Traffic Act. =India= Headlight flashing in India is often used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering to let you go first. Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user. It is also used to indicate to an oncoming vehicle to either stop or give way in narrow lanes. =Jamaica= On some occasions, motorists who flashed their headlights to warn of police activity have unwittingly helped fugitives evade police. In 2008, one of Jamaica's most wanted men went around police checkpoints which had been set up on his most likely routes after a driver had flashed his headlights to warn of police ahead. Drivers were warned that flashing headlights may result in \\"unwittingly facilitating criminal activity\\". =Philippines= Headlight flashing is understood differently in Philippines than usual global understanding. Drivers in Philippines use headlight flashing to inform pedestrian of their presence so pedestrians need to be cautious and stay on sidewalk instead of crossing there and then. This has become the norm that in crossroads, whoever flashed their headlights first gets to cross first. =United Kingdom= Though not all of its rules represent law, the Highway Code states \\"Only flash your headlights to let other road users know that you are there. Do not flash your headlights in an attempt to intimidate other road users\\". Headlight flashing in the United Kingdom is often used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering to let you go first. Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user. Using it to indicate that you are coming through and the other driver must wait, could lead to an accident. Drivers should also be aware of the so-called \\"Flash-for- Cash\\" scam, in which criminals flash their lights to let other drivers out of a junction, then crash into them on purpose in order to make fraudulent insurance claims for damage and whiplash injury. =United States= In the United States, although the legality of headlight flashing varies from state to state, a federal court ruled that flashing headlights was a constitutionally protected form of speech, issuing an injunction prohibiting a police department from citing or prosecuting drivers who flash their lights to warn of radar and speed traps. On 23 April 2019, another court ruled that headlight flashing may be protected by the First Amendment. Two state circuit courts have also ruled that headlight flashing is protected activity. Some states consider that drivers have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights. In other states, law enforcement officers give citations for headlight flashing under three types of laws: (1) laws prohibiting a person from obstructing a police investigation, (2) laws prohibiting a person from having flashing lights on their vehicle, and (3) laws prohibiting shining a vehicle's high beams at oncoming traffic. The specific language of each law varies by state along with courts' holdings on whether their respective laws prohibit headlight flashing. Additionally, although not legally binding, the state driver's manual of some states suggests flashing high beams under specific scenarios (e.g. if an oncoming vehicle is using its high beams, driver's manuals suggest a motorist flash his or her high beams momentarily). In Alaska, a State Trooper has probable cause to stop a driver who flashes a vehicle's high beams based upon a violation of 13 AAC 04.020(e)(1). In Arizona, flashing high beams or headlights is a violation of A.R.S. Section 28-942.1 (Failure to Dim Headlights). However, A.R.S. Section 28-942.2. states: If the driver of a vehicle follows another vehicle within 200 feet to the rear, except when engaged in the act of overtaking and passing, the driver shall use a distribution of light permissible under this article other than the uppermost distribution of light specified in section 28-941, paragraph 1. In California, headlight flashing is legal in some situations and illegal in others. It is legal for a driver to flash his headlights to indicate intention to pass on a road which does not allow passing on the right. However, headlight flashing on multiple-lane highways is illegal. In Florida, headlight flashing is protected free speech pursuant to the First Amendment. Additionally, on 1 January 2013, ¬ß316.2397(7), Fla. Stat. was amended to legalize headlight flashing. In 2005 and 2011, judges in County Court held that flashing a vehicle's headlights is not a violation of ¬ß316.239(7), Fla. Stat. In Illinois, a \\"flashing to warn\\" citation was successfully defended on 7 May 2015 in Boone County, via People vs. White, as the bench trial judge found the use of Illinois Vehicle Code 12-212(b) addresses lighting equipment, but not motorist behavior relative to usage of lighting systems. In Louisiana, drivers who flash headlights are typically cited for a violation of Louisiana Revised Statute Title 32:327, Section C which states: Flashing lights are prohibited except on authorized emergency vehicles, school buses, or on any vehicle as a means of indicating a right or left turn, or the presence of a vehicular traffic hazard requiring unusual care in approaching, overtaking or passing.http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=88269 In Maryland, police officers sometimes ticket drivers for flashing car headlights under a law which prohibits driving in a vehicle with flashing lights and laws prohibiting \\"obstructing a police investigation\\". The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland challenges the current interpretation of the law, contending the law refers to an adjective and not a verb; that automatic flashing lights on non- emergency vehicles are illegal, but the act by a driver of manually flashing a vehicle's headlamps is not. Though ticketing was common in the 1990s, Maryland and Washington DC police say that flashing one's headlights was not against the law in either place. In Massachusetts, the practice of headlight flashing is technically not forbidden. A suspicious police officer can ask a motorist if they were flashing their lights to warn oncoming motorists of police presence. If the motorist denies this, the officer can ask if the vehicle has defective lights, which is a violation of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 90, Section 7. In Michigan, it is illegal to flash high beams within 500 feet of oncoming traffic. In Minnesota, drivers are not prohibited from briefly flashing their high beams in a manner that does not blind or impair approaching drivers. In Missouri, a trial judge in St. Louis held that drivers have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights. In New Jersey, drivers are allowed to flash their headlights to warn approaching drivers about a speed trap ahead. In 1999, The Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division held that a statute limiting how far high beams may project is not violated when a motorist flashes his or her high beams to warn oncoming motorists of radar. The Court also concluded that a stop by a police officer based upon high beam flashing is also improper.State v. Luptak, A-6074-97T1 (Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division 29 July 1999). In New York, headlight flashing is not illegal. New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 375 [3] requires that headlamps \\"shall be operated so that dazzling light does not interfere with the driver of the approaching vehicle\\". In 1994, New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division held that flipping or flicking high beams at approaching vehicles is insufficient to cause the \\"dazzling lights\\" prohibited under New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 375 [3]. In 2009, the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division (Fourth Department) held that the flashing of lights alone is not a violation of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 375 [3], that stopping a vehicle based upon that is illegal, and all evidence gathered as a result of the illegal stop should be suppressed. In North Dakota, when an oncoming vehicle is within 500 feet, high-beam flashing for any length of time (including momentary flashes) and for any purpose at night is illegal under N.D.C.C. Section 39-21-21. In Ohio, courts have held that the act of flashing one's headlights so as to alert oncoming drivers of a radar trap does not constitute the offense of obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties, where there was no proof that the warned vehicles were speeding prior to the warning.Akron v. Matteson, 63 O.O.2d 146, 299 N.E.2d 315 (M.C. 1972) In another case, where a driver received a citation under an ordinance prohibiting flashing lights on a vehicle, a court held that the ordinance referred to the noun of flashing lights and did not prohibit the verb of flashing the headlights on a vehicle. In a different case, a court held that a momentary flick of the high beams is not a violation of Ohio R.C. 4513.15 (which prohibits drivers from aiming glaring rays into the eyes of oncoming drivers). In Oregon, a court ruled that flashing a vehicle's headlights to warn others about the presence of law enforcement is protected free speech under Article I, section 8, of the Constitution of Oregon. In Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has ruled that flashing one's highbeams during the day to warn of speed traps is legal. In Tennessee, flashing headlights to warn oncoming traffic of a police car ahead is protected free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.State v. Walker, No. I-9507- 03625 (Williamson Cty. (Tenn.) Cir. Ct. 13 November 2003) In Virginia, headlight flashing to warn of police activity is not against the law; however radar detectors remain outlawed. Virginia motor vehicle code specifies an \\"audible or light signal\\" to indicate overtaken vehicles should yield in certain situations In Washington, flashing high beams could be considered illegal, as section 46.37.230 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) states that drivers may not use their high beams within of oncoming traffic, or within of traffic in front of them. However, at least in the case of oncoming traffic, other courts interpreting a statute similar to this one have held that momentary headlight flashing which does not adversely affect the vision of the oncoming driver is not prohibited. Under Washington's law, violating RCW 46.37.230 may result in a $124 traffic infraction. In Wisconsin, the law allows a vehicle operator to intermittently flash a vehicle's highbeam headlamps at an oncoming vehicle whose highbeam headlamps are lit. Urban legend Beginning in the early 1980s, a widespread rumor regarding flashing headlights was spread mainly through fax, and later on the Internet. The rumor stated that various gangs across the United States carry out an initiation wherein the initiate drives around at night with his headlights off. Whichever driver flashes his headlamps in response to the unlit car becomes the target; to complete the initiation, the prospective gang member must hunt down and shoot, kill, assault, or rape the target. The story was widely spread by many government organizations, including the New Mexico State Police. This rumor has been proven an urban legend. The story originated in Montana in the early 1980s, where it was rumored that the Hells Angels bike gang was initiating recruits in this way. By 1984, the story had spread to Eugene, Oregon, where it had morphed into a story of Latino and black gangs targeting whites. In August 1993, the story once again appeared, this time spread through fax and email forwarding. Warning of a \\"blood initiation weekend\\" on 25 and 26 September, the rumor this time led some police departments to issue warnings after having received the fake ones. In February 1994, a resident of Massillon, Ohio revived the rumor by issuing flyers which claimed that killings would take place at Westfield Belden Village. After a night of sending faxes to local businesses, the person was arrested for inducing panic. The rumor once again spread in October 1998, when a new fax, this time claiming to originate with a Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) officer in Texas. The rumor spread further when officials in the San Diego government circulated the fax among city agencies; this version of the fax, though quickly dismissed within city government when it was found that the Sheriff's office had no real connection to it, now appeared to be a legitimate government-issued document. Also in the fall of 1998, the Sheriff's office of Nassau County, Florida sent a warning about such gang initiation to the county fire department, who subsequently spread the fax to all county agencies. Police dispatcher Ann Johnson had thought the message urgent enough to send, but had not bothered to check its legitimacy. The rumor provided inspiration for the 1998 film Urban Legend, and served as a plot device in Mark Billingham's 2008 novel In The Dark. An incident inspired by this legend is the catalyst for the 2007 film Death Sentence.

He is best known for creating hyper-real images set against stark white backgrounds. His subjects have included birds, endangered species of animals, politicians, humanitarians, artists, and entertainers. Zuckerman received his BFA from the School of Visual Arts in 1999. He began his career as a commercial still life photographer, before releasing the book, Creature, a portrait series of animals, in 2007. He has since published four additional volumes: Wisdom (2008), Bird (2009), Music (2010), and Flower (2012). Wisdom and Music were also realized as feature length, interview-format documentary films. In 2006, Zuckerman co-founded the company, Late Night and Weekends, through which he released the acclaimed documentary, Still Bill, about the life of Blues musician, Bill Withers, and created campaigns for brands including Puma and Gap. He produced and directed his first short narrative film, High Falls, starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, in 2007. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and received the award for best short narrative at the Woodstock Film Festival the same year. Writing for The New York Times, David Carr called the project \\"a pretty film, and a pretty smart film.\\" His photographic and film work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions internationally. Works, Technique and Exhibitions Zuckerman has spoken extensively about his interest in systematically collecting and organizing data to create multiple entry points into work that is conceptual in nature. One such system is a comprehensive mobile studio, consisting of fourteen cases of equipment, with which Zuckerman has traveled the world in order to situate all of his subjects in the same space. In addition to photographers including Richard Avedon and Irving Penn, he cites designers like Massimo and Lella Vignelli and Buckminster Fuller as influences,Blackwell, Lewis (2009) Photo Wisdom Chronicle, p. 24, . and has said that his minimalist style is ‚Äúa function of what I was after conceptually with the work I was creating [and] a solution to a series of desires I have for what I want my work to communicate‚Äù rather than an aesthetic choice. He has discussed his use of white as a transportational device that allows him to draw out the essential nature of his subjects. Zuckerman began exploring his signature approach in Creature. By dispensing with the environmental framework of conventional nature photography, the images focus on the form and character of a specific animal in a specific space, rather than its behavior in a habitat or evolutionary purpose. Zuckerman has said that he drew inspiration from the dioramas at the Museum of Natural History and was interested in creating a kind of two- dimensional taxidermy. The book includes a taxonimical index for each of the species photographed. In 2014, works from the Creature series were displayed as a part of the Nevada Museum of Art's Late Harvest exhibit and two were retained for the museum's permanent collection. Zuckerman applied the same visual language ‚Äì intimate, close-up portraits against a bright white background ‚Äì to the Wisdom project, for which he filmed, photographed, and interviewed 60 politicians, artists, entertainers, designers and religious and business leaders over the age of 65, including Chuck Close, Frank Gehry, Judi Dench, Clint Eastwood, Jane Goodall, Desmond Tutu, and Ted Kennedy. During the making of Wisdom, Zuckerman became interested in the idea of the dynamic portrait, one that incorporates voice, physical presence, and written word. Interviewing subjects around the common themes of love, work, conflict resolution, and the environment, and utilizing a mobile studio, Zuckerman aimed to place his contributors in the same virtual space and conversation, creating what he refers to as a ‚Äúgroup of global elders to speak to our global village‚Äù. The Wisdom traveling exhibit, which premiered at The Library of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, incorporates text, video, and images from the project, and continues to tour internationally today. Following the release of Wisdom, Zuckerman began work on Bird. His hyper-detailed photographs of over seventy species nod at John James Audubon‚Äôs ornithological drawings. In order to capture physical qualities and flight activity rarely visible to the viewer, Zuckerman instituted a variety of techniques, including a custom-built delay system, in which the bird‚Äôs movement triggered the exposure. In 2012, his image of the Blue Fronted Amazon in flight was included in Florian Heine's Photography: The Groundbreaking Moments. Of Zuckerman's imagery, Heine lauded \\"the variety and the brilliant colors [which] have never been shown in this way before.\\"Heine, Florian (2012) \\"Photography: The Groundbreaking Moments\\" Prestel, p. 143, . The Bird website features a short accompanying film, and incorporates additional data such as wingspan and audio files of each species‚Äô call. Both Creature and Bird are informed by a conservationist element, and include portraits of many rare or endangered animals. Music, was released as a book, film, and iPad application in 2010, and features portraits of and interviews with musicians from disparate genres, including Lenny Kravitz, Ozzy Osbourne, Herbie Hancock, and Philip Glass. Following the footprint he laid out in Wisdom, Zuckerman touched upon similar themes in interviews with each of his contributors, and the documentary intersects footage of the artists as they discuss performance, collaboration, inspiration, and success. Returning to his visual survey of the natural world with his 2012 project, Flower, Zuckerman photographed over 230 varieties of flora, drawing inspiration from 19th century botanical drawings. He has expressed his desire to create, with the use of modern technology, \\"the best possible two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional living things\\", and to separate his subject from its metaphorical associations in art. Like Creature and Bird, Flower includes a taxonomical index. The project, which filmmaker David Lynch has called \\"a grand celebration of mother nature's artistry\\" , also incorporates time lapse films of the life cycles of seven different species. The films were created from high definition stills, as opposed to video footage. The 2013 Flowers and Mushrooms show at the Museum de Moderne in Salzburg included four works from the Flower series, along with work by Andy Warhol, David LaChapelle, and Peter Fischli and David Weiss.http://www.museumdermoderne.at/en/exhibitions/current/details/mdm/flowers- mushrooms/ Zuckerman's flowers were also exhibited at the Museum Schloss Moyland. Zuckerman has expressed his interest in exploring singular subjects from a multitude of perspectives and engaging his audience across a variety of platforms. In 2016, he engaged in a year-long curation of design objects that reflected the intersection of man and nature at Chamber Gallery in New York.https://www.wired.com/2016/05/unusual-doesnt-even-begin-describe- exhibition/https://www.wired.com/2016/05/unusual-doesnt-even-begin-describe- exhibition/ Books *Creature (2007) *Wisdom (2008) *Bird (2009) *Music (2010) *\\"Flower\\" (2012) *Designed by Apple in California (2016) http://andrewzuckerman.com/designed-by-apple-in-california/ Films *High Falls (2007), Director, Producer *Wisdom (2008), Director, Producer, Executive Producer *\\"Bird\\" (2009), Director, Producer *Still BIll (2009), Executive Producer *Music (2010), Director, Producer, Executive Producer *\\"Flower\\" (2012), Director, Producer Solo exhibitions 2007 Creature, Forma International Center of Photography, Milan, Italy 2008 Wisdom, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia 2009 Bird Film, High Line, New York City, NY Bird, Colette, Paris, France 2010 Bird Film, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, MA Bird Film, International Film Festival Breda, Breda, The Netherlands Wisdom Exhibit, World Financial Center, Winter Garden, New York City, NY Wisdom Exhibit, Siamsa Tire Gallery, Dingle, Ireland 2011 Wisdom, Bank of America Plaza, Los Angeles, CA Wisdom, Brookfield Place Adam Lambert Galleria, Toronto, CA Wisdom, Bay Adelaide Center, Toronto, CA Selected group exhibitions 1999 SVA mentor show 2003 Young Guns Show 2007 SUNY ULSTER Muroff Kotler Gallery, Stone Ridge New York, USA 2008 Paris Photo, Carrousel du Louvre, Paris, France 2011 Obstacle, Invisible Dog Gallery, Brooklyn, NY, USA Getxphoto Festival, Bilbao, Spain 2013 Flowers and Mushrooms Museum der Moderne, Salzburg, Austria 2014 Late Harvest, Nevada Museum of Art, Reno, NV, USA 2016 Say It with Flowers, Museum Schloss Moyland, Bedburg-Hau, Germany Honors and awards 2003 Art Directors Club, Young Guns 2005 Broadcast Design Award 2006 D&AD; Yellow Pencil For Photography 2007 High Falls, Woodstock Film Festival, Best Short Film High Falls, Sundance Film Festival, Official Selection\\" Annuals 2003 American Photography Annual Communication Arts Annual 2005 Communication Arts Photography Annual PDN Photography Annual PDN 30 2006 Communication Arts Annual PDN Photography Annual 2007 PDN Digital_Personal PDN Digital_Music Graphis Advertising Annual Graphis Photography Annual PDN Photography Annual 2008 Communication Arts Annual PDN Photo Annual Graphis Photography Annual 2009 American Photography 25 Communication Arts Annual 2010 Graphis Photography Annual American Photography 26 PDN Photo Annual Communication Arts D&AD; Annual 2011 Graphis Photography Annual, 100 Best in Photography External referencesReferencesExternal links *andrewzuckerman.com *creaturebook.com *wisdombook.org *Bird *Music *latenightandweekends.com Interview with Andrew Zuckerman Video links *Creature Behind the Scenes *Wisdom Trailer *Wisdom Behind the Scenes *Bird Film *Bird Behind the Scenes *Music Trailer *Music Making of Footage *Andrew Zuckerman on Ellen *Creative Mornings Talk *Zuckerman on Carson Daly *Zuckerman at the 2011 99% Conference American Jews 1977 births Living people American photographers School of Visual Arts alumni ","title":"Andrew Zuckerman"},{"id":"23720975","text":"The House Theatre of Chicago is a non-profit, ensemble theatre company in Chicago, IL.

Some Seneca also live with other Iroquois peoples on the Six Nations of the Grand River in Ontario. The Seneca Nation has three reservations, two of which are occupied: Cattaraugus Reservation, Allegany Indian Reservation, and the mostly unpopulated Oil Springs Reservation. It has two alternating capitals on the two occupied reservations: Irving at Cattaraugus Reservation, and Jimerson Town near Salamanca on the Allegany Reservation.\\"New York Casinos.\\" 500 Nations. (retrieved 31 May 2010) A fourth territory de facto governed by the nation, the Cornplanter Tract in Pennsylvania, officially expired in 1957 and was flooded in 1965. Government The government of this tribe was established in 1848 by a Constitutional Convention of Seneca Indians residing on the Allegany and Cattaraugus Territories in present-day New York. The Seneca Nation of Indians Constitution established a tri-partite governing structure based on general elections of 16 Councilors, three Executives (President, Treasurer, Clerk), and Court justices (Surrogates and Peacemakers). These elections are held every two years, on the first Tuesday in November, usually concurrent with Election Day in the rest of the United States (the exception is in years when November 1 is a Tuesday; in those years, the Seneca Nation holds their election on November 1 while the rest of the U.S. holds their elections November 8). The leadership rotates between the two reservations each election, and no officer can serve consecutive terms because of this. There are no other term limits, and elected officers can serve numerous nonconsecutive terms.\\"Government.\\" Seneca Nation of Indians. (retrieved 31 May 2010) The Council has established rules for membership or citizenship within the nation. In the 21st century, the Seneca Nation of Indians in New York has a total enrolled population of nearly 8,000 citizens. Its territories are generally rural, with several residential areas. Many Seneca citizens live off-territory, and some are located across the country, as well as in other countries. Off-territory residents, who often work in the urban areas that provide more jobs, comprise nearly 1/2 of the enrolled citizens. These off-territory members are eligible to vote and are often bussed in during elections. The Seneca Nation's republican form of government stands in contrast to that of the federally recognized Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians. That tribe has retained the traditional native government of hereditary chiefs chosen by clan mothers from the maternal lines responsible for such leadership. Such hereditary leaders were deposed in the 1848 convention of the Seneca Nation of New York. They and followers split off and organized the Tonawanda Band, later gaining federal recognition. Women were denied the right to vote in Seneca elections until the early 1960s. The tribe's male voters had rejected female suffrage in three consecutive referenda in the 1950s, all rejected with widespread opposition from the Allegany Reservation, before the referendum passed. =Politics= Since the late 20th century, the Seneca government is reported to be primarily under one-party rule, with the Seneca Party having control of the political process. In 2011, the Seneca Party was reported by The Buffalo News as having bribed people for votes and bussed voters in from out of state during elections.Herbeck, Dan (November 15, 2011). \\"Resentments abound in Seneca power struggle\\", The Buffalo News.

Gates overtakes Snyder in Seneca nation vote. Business First. Retrieved September 26, 2016. Opposing political parties have accused the party of electoral malfeasance through violating the secret ballot. According to J.C. Seneca, a former Seneca Party politician who defected from the party in 2014, the ruling class has ensured that only the Seneca Party has had enough candidates to qualify for straight-ticket voting in which voters can select all of a party's candidates for office with a single ballot mark by intimidating candidates from other parties out of the race, and on election day, poll workers eavesdrop upon voters by timing how long it takes to cast a ballot. In years past, the nation has used lever- action voting machines, a process that will be replaced as of 2016 by scanned paper ballots, If a poll worker heard a voter depress more than one lever, or take too long to complete their ballot, they could report this back to the Seneca Party bosses, who could then punish the voter by denying them jobs or seizing their homes.Miller, Rick (October 26, 2016). J.C. Seneca seeks Seneca Nation presidency again. The Salamanca Press. Retrieved October 26, 2016. There have been numerous factions and disputes within the Seneca Party; tensions increased during the presidency of attorney Robert Odawi Porter in 2010-2012. Supporters of Porter were at odds with supporters of the John family, an old-line, politically powerful family in Seneca circles. In the years following Porter's lone term, the disputes have mostly been settled. In November 2011, the John family led a vote to depose Porter by stripping him of most of his powers and give the title of chief executive officer to Michael \\"Spike\\" John. He is the cousin of Maurice \\"Moe\\" John, who served as Seneca president from 2006 to 2008, and ran unsuccessfully for Seneca President against Porter in 2010. Diane Kennedy, Tribal Clerk and a Porter ally, invalidated this vote under conflict of interest statutes. In an October 2012 Council Session, a close friend of Kennedy said that Porter wrote the invalidation letter for Kennedy to sign. The action for de facto impeachment was taken after John supporters said politically motivated charges were made against Susan Abrams, a John ally. The 2012 elections were marked by a split in the Seneca Party and one of the most wide-open (and bitterly contested) Seneca elections in several years: five candidates competed for the post of president, including two endorsed by the two major factions in the Seneca Party.Herbeck, Dan (October 27, 2012). \\"A bitter battle to lead Seneca Nation\\", The Buffalo News.

Economic development The tribe owns and operates the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino, located in Buffalo.\\"Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino.\\" Seneca Gaming Corporation. (retrieved 31 May 2010) Other gaming and resort properties include the Seneca Allegany Casino in Salamanca and Seneca Niagara Casino in Niagara Falls. The Seneca Nation also owns Seneca Gaming and Entertainment, a chain of small video slots and bingo facilities with locations in Irving, Salamanca, and on the Oil Spring Reservation in Cuba. Through a tribal-owned holding company, the tribe owns a telecommunications firm, Seneca Telecommunications; a construction management company, SCMC LLC; and a radio station, WGWE. Under the presidency of Robert Odawi Porter, the tribe began pursuing diversification of the Nation's businesses. It promoted founding of new Seneca-owned businesses beyond the Nation's traditional strongholds of gasoline retail and tobacco products. In 2010 the tribe acquired a controlling interest in wireless and telecommunications provider CT COMM, based in Washington, D.C. The tribe has developed a brand of cigarettes called Native Pride. The tribe also owns a small chain of smoke shops and gas stations under the \\"Seneca One Stop\\" brand, but the vast majority of smoke shops on Seneca reservations are independently owned. The refusal of Seneca businesses to pay New York state excise taxes, because their businesses are operated on sovereign land, has given them a price advantage over non-Seneca, to whom the Seneca refuse to grant equal rights on their territory. The issue of such excise taxes has been a source of controversy between the tribes and the state government and non-Seneca convenience store operators in the vicinity for several decades. =Seneca Pumped Storage Project at Kinzua Dam= For decades, the Seneca developed their land primarily for agricultural and related uses. The floodplain along the river was highly fertile. In the 1960s, members of the tribe became increasingly politically active. This was related to asserting sovereignty as part of a general Native American activism in this period and, specifically, to try to defeat proposals by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to take thousands of acres of reservation land as part of construction of Kinzua Dam, a flood-control project on the River. While alternatives existed, the federal government's study concluded that these were not viable. The COE proceeded with the project: construction of the dam and associated reservoir. While alternatives existed (alternatives that the federal government considered not only non-viable, but laughable in their lack of understanding of hydrology), the COE proceeded with the project: construction of the dam and associated reservoir caused huge losses for the tribe, taking 10,000 acres of their reservation, nearly one third of their total property and much of it the most fertile farmland. More than 600 families were displaced and relocated. The tribe received a few hundred acres and relocation assistance for these families, as well as the relocation of a burial ground. They consider these to be insufficient compensation for the government's violating a 1794 treaty that guaranteed the tribe control of this reservation. In addition, the project has since caused other flooding on their land and a through road, causing the loss of additional fertile areas.Editorial Staff, \\"The Shadow of Kinzua: The Seneca Since World War II\\", New York History Blog, 26 July 2014 In the aftermath of the dam's completion, the Seneca people developed a different political dynamic.Laurence Hauptman, In the Shadow of Kinzua: The Seneca Since World War II, Syracuse University Press, 2013 As the tribe used some compensation monies to support higher education for its members, the 1960s crisis indirectly resulted in a \\"college-educated generation, some of whom now work in tribal government making major contributions to the nation‚Äôs present and future.\\"Summary: In the Shadow of Kinzua: The Seneca Since World War II, 2013, Syracuse University Press website Other young people have left the reservation to get better jobs in other areas.

The current operator, FirstEnergy of Toledo, Ohio, has a license that expires in 2015. The private sector is estimated to make $13 million in profits annually from the hydropower. President Porter has noted that, when the federal dam was proposed, tribal leaders were told only that it was needed for flood control, not that a hydroelectric project would be run there. In August 2011, the tribe received a preliminary permit from FERC to study \\"the feasibility of the additional hydropower operations and [it] grants them priority status in filing for the full permit.\\"James Fink, \\"Senecas permitted for Kinzua Dam\\", Buffalo Business Journal, 12 August 2011 The Nation was required to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to obtain documents relevant to adding new generation infrastructure to its dam.\\"Seneca Nation of Indians receives initial Kinzua Hydro permit\\" , The Observer, 13 August 2011, accessed 13 April 2015 In November 2013, FERC approved FirstEnergy's sale of 11 hydro plants, including that at Kinzua Dam, which is the biggest project, to a unit of independent developer LS Power Group. This did not affect any transfers of operating licenses, which FERC noted were pending separate approvals.\\"FERC OKs sale of 11 FirstEnergy hydro plants; license transfers pending\\", Hydro World, 11 November 2013, accessed 13 April 2015 President Porter noted that the dam has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in profits for operators since it started in 1970, but the Seneca have not received any of that money. It also noted that the federal government had licensed the private hydropower project to use the Allegheny Reservoir, but no operator had ever obtained property rights from the Seneca Nation for operation of the dam.\\"Seneca Nation Identifies Major Shortcomings of Competition in Fight for Federal Hydro License\\" , Seneca Nation of Indians, 7 March 2013, accessed 13 April 2015 On July 22, 2015, the Commission issued a new 50-year license to Seneca Generation to continue operation of the Kinzua Project, effective December 1, 2015. That year, Seneca Generation sought relief from requirements by federal resource agencies related to measures to protect rare and endangered species below the dam. FERC denied a rehearing and stay requested by the company.\\"153 FERC ¬∂ 61,234/ US FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION/ ORDER DENYING REHEARING AND STAY\\", Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, issued November 19, 2015; accessed 1 August 2016 =Transit service= In 2013, the Seneca launched a public transit bus service to serve both the Cattaraugus and the western portion of the Allegany reservations; it operates one route, running along NY 438, NY 353, Old Route 17, I-86 and West Perimeter Road between Irving and Highbanks. The service is open to non-Seneca along the route. Relationship with non-Seneca Mary Jemison was the daughter of an Irish family who had settled in Pennsylvania. She was taken prisoner by Shawnee Indians during the French and Indian War. Historical accounts recorded by Dr. James Seaver indicate that Jemison was adopted by a Seneca tribe and became assimilated. She married two Native American men in succession, and raised their children in the Seneca culture. She was known to act as a liaison between her newly adopted Seneca Nation and European-American settlers, particularly in explaining treaty agreements. The tribe claims authority to banish non-Seneca individuals from tribal lands; it has historically used this power in only rare circumstances, such as a December 2016 incident in which six non-natives were banished from the tribe's territories, two of whom were banned for minor traffic violations and the other four for drug possession. Exercising sovereignty over reservation lands Since the later 20th century, the Seneca have been increasingly active in exercising sovereignty on their reservation and enforcing their property rights. Their relations with the non-Native surrounding population have become contentious, in regard to excise tax advantages and to their property rights. In the 1990s, the Senecas won a prolonged court battle to assume ownership of all land on their reservation, including that owned by private non-Seneca. (This was particularly contentious in Salamanca, where non-Native landownership had been tolerated for decades. State and local officials said that this is the only United States city located on Indian reservation land; under the recognized law of the time, the underlying land remained Seneca owned, but \\"improvements\\" on that land were not subject to lease and were still privately owned.) The city had been developed under a 99-year federal lease arrangement with the Seneca Nation. It had provided land to railroads to encourage development, which the railroad developed for workers and their families, and related businesses. This arrangement was confirmed by acts of Congress in 1875, 1890 and 1990. When that lease expired in 1991, the Seneca Nation demanded that the previous owners sign new leases with their nation for not only the underlying land, but also the improvements as well, or be evicted.Zito, Selena (June 5, 2011). \\"Smokes cheap, tensions high\\", Pittsburgh Tribune (Also titled \\"Portrait of a Failed American City\\", Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Retrieved July 28, 2012.) The Seneca evicted fifteen property owners from their homes for refusing to sign over their properties.Herbeck, Dan and Kathleen Ronayne (July 28, 2012). \\"Senecas plan to evict Snyder Beach residents\\", The Buffalo News. Retrieved July 28, 2012. The increase in lease revenue from this reinterpretation has generated sufficient revenue for the nation to pay its enrolled members a quarterly social dividend, providing those members with a basic income. In a similar case in 2012, the Seneca ordered an eviction of 80 residents of summer cottages at Snyder Beach on the Cattaraugus Reservation, a location near Sunset Bay. They had previously notified the owner of the land that his leases to non-Seneca were not permissible, but he had done nothing to clear his property. Some of the residents were from families who had rented there for decades. The Seneca described the non-Natives as constituting a long-standing \\"illegal occupation\\". Culture The Seneca were the largest of the six Native American nations that comprised the Iroquois Confederacy or Six Nations. Their democratic government pre-dated the United States Constitution. In the Iroquois Confederacy, the Seneca were traditionally known as the \\"Keeper of the Western Door,\\" for they are the westernmost of the Six Nations. In the Seneca language the people are known as O-non-dowa-gah, (pronounced: Oh-n'own-dough-wahgah) or \\"Great Hill People.\\" At the time of the formation of the Iroquois League, the original five nations of the Iroquois League occupied large areas of land in Northeast North America, particularly present-day New York and Pennsylvania, and Southeast Canada. The historical Seneca occupied territory throughout the Finger Lakes area in Central New York, and in the Genesee Valley in Western New York, living in longhouses on the riversides. The villages were well fortified with wooden-stake palisade fences. These were settled communities in which the people cultivated staple crops known as the Three Sisters: varieties of corn, beans, and squash, which were known as Deohako (pronounced: Jo- hay- ko), \\"the life supporters.\\" Generally the women cultivated and processed the crops, maintaining seed crops and experimenting with varieties. Seneca men were subsistence hunters and fishers. The Seneca were highly skilled at warfare, and were considered fierce adversaries by other Native Americans and European colonists. But the Seneca were also renowned for their sophisticated skills at diplomacy and oratory, and their willingness to unite with the other four of the original Five Nations to form the Iroquois Confederacy of Nations. Today the Seneca Nation sustains its own people. Its enterprises benefit surrounding communities with a variety of cultural, educational and economic efforts. Its varied enterprises include: world-class casino gaming, hospitality and entertainment, which employ over 3,500 people; a convenience store chain (four stores), construction management, and diverse holdings in business ventures. Seneca language, song, art, dance, and sports are all vital expressions of their culture. The number of fluent Seneca language speakers is diminishing due to the deaths of elders, and the language is considered at-risk. The Nation has established language programs to help protect, preserve and develop a new generation of Seneca- language speakers to keep the language alive. Lacrosse is a sport played by male and female, young and old. Two new community sports complexes on each territory enable year-round lacrosse leagues and space for community programs, crafts and learning. Like other Iroquois tribes, Seneca Nation lacrosse players compete internationally on the Iroquois Nationals and Haudenosaunee Nationals squads, organized by the First Nations Lacrosse Association, which competes on par with fully sovereign nations such as the U.S. and Canada in international competition. A Faithkeepers' School supports and ensures the ongoing practice of traditional teachings, arts, knowledge and the living culture of the Longhouse ways. The vibrancy of the rich Seneca heritage is evident in the ceremonies, practices, and cultural events that are infused with dance, music and song, arts, crafts and traditional foods that honor and celebrate Seneca culture.

He became one of the Seneca's most trusted negotiators with the Americans of the new United States. In later age, Cornplanter was granted a large plot of land in Pennsylvania, an area that was flooded following construction of the Kinzua Dam in the mid-20th century.

The main goal was to return control over the movement of a ship to the military officer. Background In 1902, Fisher returned to the UK (having been Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet) as Second Sea Lord in charge of personnel. At this time engineering officers, which had become increasingly important in the fleet as it became steadily more dependent upon machinery, were still largely looked down upon by command officers. Fisher considered it would be better for the navy if the two branches could be merged, as had been done in the past with navigation which similarly had once been a completely separate specialty. He wanted the Navy to have one system of supply, one system of entry and one system of training. His solution was to merge the cadet training of military and engineer officers, and revise the curriculum so that it provided a suitable grounding to later go on to either path. The proposal was initially resisted by the remainder of the board of Admiralty, but Fisher convinced them of the benefits of the changes. Integration The scheme was announced in 1903, but the amalgamation of the military and engineering branches was completed in November 1905 when the Cawdor Memorandum was published, which integrated the enlisted portion of the engineering branch, the stokers, into the military branch. As part of the scheme, cadets would enter the service between the ages of 12 and 13 under the same conditions, would be trained together under the same system until they passed the rank of sub-lieutenant when they would be distributed between the military branch, the engineering branch, and the Royal Marines, although ultimately the Royal Marines did not participate in the scheme. Three months after the scheme was announced, a new Royal Naval College, Osborne, was created at Osborne House, Queen Victoria's old home on the Isle of Wight. A new facility was also built in Dartmouth to replace Britannia, and once it was completed in 1910 the Royal Naval Engineering College at Keyham was closed. The old rank of mate was revived in 1913 as part of the scheme for the accelerated promotion of promising enlisted personnel to become engineers. Mates ranked with, but after, sub-lieutenants and messed separately. In addition, promotion from Mate (E) was to the old Engineer Lieutenant rank, not to Lieutenant (E). Integration reversed After World War I, opposition to the scheme gave rise to a movement to re- segregate the executive and engineering branches because during the war, officers were not able to be equally proficient at both engineering and executive duties. As part of this movement, the Royal Naval Engineering College was reopened in 1919, and in 1922 engineering training began for midshipmen, instead of sub-lieutenants. In 1921, the naval college at Osborne was no longer needed and was closed. By 1925, there were five branches of the Service: Military, Medical, Accountant, Naval Instructor, and Artisan. That year, an Order in Council ended the scheme, splitting the service into 12 categories: Executive, Engineer, Medical, Dental, Accountant and Instructor Officers, Chaplains, Shipwrights, Ordinance and Electrical Officers, Schoolmasters and Wardmasters. Shortly afterwards, the ranks of Midshipman (E) and Sub-lieutenant (E) appeared in Orders in Council for the first time. In 1931 mate was abandoned again, and mates were re-mustered as sub-lieutenants. The scheme left behind common entry, so all candidates for the engineering branch entered the Navy by the same route as those in the executive branch.

Gurney's distributes catalogs throughout the nation, and maintains a considerable web presence.  History  Charles W. Gurney (born May 13, 1840) a Lieutenant Colonel during the American Civil War, opened his first nursery, Hesperian Nurseries, in 1866 in Monticello, Iowa.Col. Charles W. Gurney Biography The business remained in Monticello until 1882, when the business was moved to Dixon County, Nebraska. After realizing the trade potential in towns near rivers, Gurney moved Hesperian Nurseries to Yankton, South Dakota, in 1897.Gurney Seed and Nursery Company, Victory Horticultural Library. C.W. Gurney's seven sons were very involved in the family seed business, and in 1906, C.W. Gurney and his sons, and one nephew, had the nursery incorporated as Gurney's Seed and Nursery Company. The company started listing products on a generic price list for mailing purposes, until 1910, when Gurney's published its first large seed and nursery catalog with a full-color cover. Upon Charles W. Gurney's death in 1913, his sons and nephew continued the seed and nursery business. In 1919, Deloss Butler Gurney, one of the Colonel's sons, became CEO. The company diversified and grew quickly. By 1924, the Gurney seed house was one of the largest in the world, receiving orders from 46 of the 48 states and many foreign countries. In 1925, John Chandler Gurney, Deloss Butler's son, made a name for himself as a radio announcer and programmer for the Yankton radio station WNAX. In 1927, John Chandler \\"Chan\\" Gurney convinced his father to buy the radio station, which became known as \\"WNAX - Voice of the House of Gurney in Yankton.\\" The station was used to promote Gurney products and services, making Gurney's a household name. In the early 1930s, the large Gurney's seed house and storefront became one of Yankton's first shopping centers, housing a retail greenhouse, a barber, a grocery store, a jeweler, a medicine store and a restaurant/hotel. These products and services were all promoted by Chan at WNAX. The company also experiment in the fuel industry in the 1940s and, later, it was active in the home front war effort during World War II. D.B. Gurney died in 1943, but the business sustained. D.B.'s son, John Chandler Gurney, became involved in politics, and served as a U.S. Senator for the state of South Dakota from 1939 to 1951.

It aims for the creation of an international order of, by and for the people.  History  As Federal Union, Inc. The Streit Council is a successor to Federal Union Inc., founded in 1939 by Clarence Streit ‚Äì a New York Times journalist and author of Union Now. He proposed a union of democracies around the Atlantic that would be capable enough to deter, and if necessary defend, against any combination of totalitarian regimes - thus avoiding the outbreak of WWII. Streit also advocated this initial federation of the world's leading democracies ‚Äì with a common constitution, foreign policy, defense, and economy ‚Äì as a strategy for world peace. This union of democracies would serve as a model for peaceful and democratic interaction among nations and their peoples, and remain open to accepting additional democracies as they emerged and expressed interest in joining. Federal Union was the first popular US-based transnational movement to advocate a union of democracies. Throughout the war, the organization insisted that increasing American material and political assistance to the Allies without entering into a union with them would undermine the prospects for extending the democratic ethos and practices to international relations. Once the US intervened against the Axis, Federal Union campaigned for postwar structures that would lead to a democratic world order. During and after the war, the organization enjoyed support from prominent figures such as Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes, and John Foster Dulles. In the postwar years, Streit‚Äôs ideas played a significant role in the formation of NATO. In 1949, Federal Union formed the Roberts-chaired Atlantic Union Committee (AUC) which pressed Congress to pursue a federation of democracies. The AUC served as the political wing of Federal Union, Inc. This led to the introduction of the Atlantic Union Resolution in the US Congress in 1949, set forth by Senator J. William Fulbright, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, and others. When the Resolution was again introduced in 1951, among those introducing it was Senator Richard M. Nixon. In the early 1950s, AUC also formed the Atlantic Assembly as an annual consultative assembly of parliamentarians from NATO countries, which formally became the North Atlantic Assembly in 1966 and was later transformed into the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (the name it operates under today). For many years afterward, similar Atlantic Union Resolutions were introduced in every session of the US Congress, with Representatives Paul Findley, Donald Fraser and Morris Udall as the lead co-sponsors. The resolutions called for the formation of an \\"Atlantic Convention\\" to draft a constitution for an Atlantic Union that would be open, worldwide, to other democracies. The Bill passed in 1960 ‚Äúwith the support of both candidates for President ‚Äì Nixon and John F. Kennedy ‚Äì and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. In the House of Representatives, it passed by an overwhelming 288 to 103.‚Äù However, by the time the Convention was actually held in 1962, the US was only represented by a Citizen‚Äôs Commission, and was prevented by law from representing the US Government. Without American backing, the suggestions made by the Convention were never followed up on. Federal Union Inc. was renamed the Association to Unite the Democracies (AUD) in 1985. As the Streit Council In 2004, the Streit Council was established as a successor to AUD. Since then, it has continued to work for the same principles, publishing research, analysis and commentary; hosting events; and contributing to the academic discourse on issues related to democratic integration and the democratization of the international order. Leadership Richard Conn Henry, a physics professor at Johns Hopkins University, serves as the current President of the Streit Council Board of Directors. Solomon Passy, a former member of the Bulgarian Parliament and Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs (2001‚Äì2005), serves as Honorary President. Tiziana Stella, a specialist in transatlantic relations, NATO, European integration, US foreign policy and federalism, acts as the Executive Director, responsible for all major projects, including overall program and research planning and management, as well as staff management.  Programs  The work of the Streit Council is divided into three core programs: Transatlantic The Transatlantic Program tracks and analyzes policy developments in the United States and Europe that affect the political, economic, and defense cohesion of the transatlantic area. This includes the rise of populism on both sides of the Atlantic, shifts in the orientation of US foreign policy, and internal and external pressures on the institutions that comprise the Euro-Atlantic system and the European Union. This program also promotes proactive policy options that address these challenges. World Organization The program on World Organization examines how the world‚Äôs democracies, and the transatlantic area in particular, can effect constructive consensus in the United Nations and other universal organizations to ensure that individual human dignity, freedom, and responsibility are permanently positioned at the center of world governance. Federal Paradigms The program on Federal Paradigms examines a) the historical and cultural factors that influence the formation and stability of federations, and b) federalism as a theory of international relations. As underexplored areas of study that shed light on the internal cohesion of democracies, potential areas for democratization in inter-democracy relations, democratic deficits in international institutions, and deficiencies in the international system, they carry significant implications for the future of democracy, U.S. foreign policy, transatlantic structures, and world organization. Publications The Streit Council regularly publishes research and analysis in the form of policy briefs, issues briefs and commentary. , the Streit Council published a journal, Freedom & Union, a revival of the magazine of the same name launched by Federal Union, Inc. in 1946. The Streit Council assisted in the English translation of former French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's book For a Union of the West, published by the Hoover Institution in 2009.  Past Events  The Streit Council has held events featuring expert analysis from guest speakers on a variety of topics, with numerous papers subsequently produced. Topics covered have included ‚ÄúEuro-Atlantic Integration and Russia after September 11,‚Äù ‚ÄúGlobal Warming: Engaging the US at The G8 Summit,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreating a Barrier-Free Transatlantic Market.‚Äù These events sought to address core concepts of the transatlantic relationship and global democratization. These events included numerous speakers, such as Peter Rodman, US Assistant Secretary of Defense; Jose-Maria Aznar, Former Prime Minister of Spain; Antonio Martino, Former Italian Defense Minister; General William Odom, former Director of the US National Security Agency; Vladimir Lukin, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma and former Russian Ambassador to Washington; Anatol Lieven, Senior Research Fellow at The New America Foundation; and Edouard Balladur, Former Prime Minister of France.

The system then encrypts the information, but does not store either the encryption key or the original information. Instead, it breaks up the decryption key into smaller components that are disseminated across distributed hash tables, or DHTs via the Internet. The DHTs refresh information within their nodes on a set schedule unless told to persist the information. The time-delay entered by the user in the metadata controls how long the DHTs should allow the information to persist, but once that time period is over, the DHTs will reuse those nodes, making the information about the decryption stored irretrievable. As long as the decryption key may be reassembled from the DHTs, the information is retrievable. However, the time initially entered by the user has lapsed, the information is not recoverable, as the user was never informed of the decryption key. Implementation Vanish currently exists as a Firefox plug-in which allows a user to enter text into either a standard Gmail email or Facebook message, and choose to send the message via Vanish. The message is then encrypted and sent via the normal networking pathways through the cloud to the recipient. The recipient must have the same Firefox plug-in to decrypt the message. The plugin accesses BitTorrent DHTs, which have 8-hour lifespans. This means the user may select an expiration date for the message in increments of 8 hours. After the expiration of the user-defined time span, the information in the DHT is overwritten, thereby eliminating the key. While both the user and recipient may have copies of the original encrypted message, the key used to turn it back into plain text is now gone. Although this particular instance of the data has become inaccessible, it's important to note that the information can always be saved by other means before expiration (copied, or even via screen shots) and published again.

There are 72 retail stores with a total floor space of 47,550 square metres (or 511,824 square feet). Character Storefronts face a network of private internal streets, and the centre layout is centred on a square which includes interpretive historical plaques and commissioned art by Douglas Coupland. The layout is similar to a regular neighbourhood retail strip. Anchors include Salomon Toronto, McEwans Gourmet Market, Anthropologie, Joey's west coast restaurant and other shops and restaurants. Parking along the internal streets is limited but a multi- level parkade is located on site. History The centre is located on the site of the demolished Don Mills Centre shopping mall. Increased competition from other shopping malls and the closure of main anchor tenant T. Eaton Co. meant declines in mall revenues and the exodus of many fashion retailers. The mall owner, developer Cadillac Fairview, decided to redevelop the site in 2003 to attract more up-scale retailers and shoppers, without a main anchor tenant. The developer proposed to demolish the indoor shopping mall and replace it with an open-air setting, along with an intensification of the site. The intensification meant the construction of a parking garage to replace the large surface parking lot. The development also included using Centre lands for new residential buildings. After community consultation, the plan was approved by the City of Toronto and the development proceeded. The Shops at Don Mills opened on April 22, 2009. McNally Robinson, a Canadian book-selling chain, was one of the first tenants, but the chain later decided to close the location.

In March 1923 between 80 and 100 suspected Irish nationalists in Britain were arrested by the police and sent to the Irish Free State under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 (ROIA). One of the detainees, Art O'Brien, challenged his detention in a test case at the Divisional Court. The case eventually went to both the Court of Appeal and House of Lords, who decided that the internments were illegal because the Irish Free State was an independent nation and so British Acts of Parliament no longer applied to it. The decision effectively illegalised the ROIA and led to the immediate release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923, which limited the money they had to pay the detainees, who eventually received ¬£43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of sedition, and was imprisoned until 1924. Background Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State was set up as an independent British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces and members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground.Hyde (1960) p.123 The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil.Chandler (1924) p.273 On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL.Hyde (1960) p.124 Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eightyAmato (2002) p.32 or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England),Chandler (1924) p.274 at least six had never even been to Ireland before. The next day the arrests were publicly queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. W.C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, said that he had directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered it legal. Divisional Court A few days after the arrests the solicitors for one of the deported men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with Sir Patrick Hastings KC, a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party and a noted barrister.Hyde (1960) p.126 On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a Divisional Court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of habeas corpus for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in Mountjoy Prison), which was required for a writ of habeas corpus to be considered, but by the time the hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed.Hyde (1960) p.127 In addition the Home Secretary had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he had no control over what happened to them there. The court eventually declared that they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.Hyde (1960) p.128 Court of Appeal and House of Lords The decision was then appealed to the Court of Appeal and argued on 23 and 24 April. The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court's decision.Bonner (2007) p.80 The court decided that the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 had been implicitly repealed when the Irish Free State, an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they had no control over what happened to them.Amato (2002) p.33 It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of habeas corpus against the Home Secretary because, even though he did not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him. The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.Hyde (1960) p.129 He appealed to the House of Lords, who decided (led by Lord Birkenhead) that they did not have the jurisdiction to hear the appeal, since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of habeas corpus is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it.Chandler (1924) p.276 After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison) he was finally released on 16 May. Aftermath O'Brien immediately sued the British Government for false imprisonment, and to avoid any liability the government prepared the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923 which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers. The Labour Party whittled it down when it was being prepared so that it would only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely. A tribunal was set up under Lord Atkin to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid ¬£43,000. Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of sedition.Bonner (2007) p.81 He was released in 1924.

Perfecto subsequently released \\"She Rides\\" by D:Fuse & Joy. This track appeared on numerous Perfecto compilations as well as the huge-selling Gatecrasher mix series, achieving combined sales of over 200,000 units. D:Fuse released \\"People_2: Both Sides Of The Picture\\", a 2xCD mix for System Recordings, in 2003. This compilation proved to be one of D:Fuse's most successful works to date, and further established his name as a producer, since this release featured eight new D:Fuse productions. He was featured on the cover of both REMIX and URB magazines, and joined the select list of performers at the legendary Coachella festival that same year. In 2004, D:Fuse was voted URB magazine's #2 Winter Music Conference DJ. He also released his debut artist album \\"Begin\\" on System Recordings to much positive acclaim. Splitting recording time between England, Los Angeles and Chicago to create a varied musical landscape, \\"Begin\\" broke new boundaries. D:Fuse's signature fusion of electronic programming and organic instrumentation, plus inspired lyric writing and vocals, re-wrote all the rules of the DJ 'artist album'. This long-awaited debut received 4 star reviews across the board in the industry media, and the single release \\"Living The Dream\\" (featuring Jes of Motorcycle) quickly achieved combined compilation sales in excess of 140,000 units. \\"Begin\\" finally provided D:Fuse with the artistic space he needed to care fully experiment with - and skillfully integrate - musical themes that had influenced him, and his unique sound, over the years: from lush downtempo to driving basslines, funky percussion, and memorable melodies. Accordingly, his live shows began attracting more varied audiences since his music was proving to be equally palatable to both house and progressive music aficionados. The accompanying \\"Begin\\" tour was a massive success and hit 75 cities throughout North and South America. In 2005 D:Fuse saw his fan base grow significantly, being voted one of the Top 15 progressive DJs in North America per the influential BPM/djmixed.com poll. D:Fuse soon teamed up with Mike Hiratzka to produce what would become one of the year's most sought after remixes: \\"The Days Of Swine And Roses\\", originally recorded by My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. This became the biggest selling single release from the popular \\"My Life Remixed\\" CD - a compilation of Thrill Kill Kult classic tracks remixed by various artists. D:Fuse has always been a true innovator on the club scene, fusing live instrumentation with DJing in the form of live percussion for the past six years. In 2005 he unveiled \\"The D:Fuse Live Experience\\", a DJ/live instrumentation hybrid featuring D:Fuse on a full percussion set up, Mike Hiratzka on guitar, bass, keyboards and vocals, plus vocals by MC Flint. The show coincided with the live CD release of \\"People_3\\" on Moist Music, recorded at clubs in San Francisco, CA and Austin, TX. The CD produced top reviews in REMIX and M3 magazines and on countless websites. The D:Fuse live tour was well received nationwide with capacity events in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Dallas, New York City, Kansas City, and a headlining slot at Miami's 2006 ULTRA Music Fest. D:Fuse's live show concept led to a team-up with The Scumfrog in 2006 to create their much-hailed project \\"DJs Are Alive\\" alongside DJ Skribble, Kristine W and Static Revenger. The project continued to spark the idea that DJ sets can inspire so much more, both audibly and visually. In 2006 D:Fuse relocated to Los Angeles to launch a new record label (Lost Angeles Recordings), and produce a full-length album, with his new production partner Mike Hiratzka. A full year of intense studio sessions produced \\"Skyline Lounge,\\" D:Fuse and Hiratzka's most ambitious work to date. The album delved even further into the use of live instrumentation with guitars, bass and percussion. It also included violins by Govinda of 18th St.. Records fame, and featured guest vocal performances by Kristy Thirsk (Delirium) and DJ Rap, plus vocal performances by D:Fuse and Hiratzka themselves. \\"Skyline Lounge\\" stayed in the top 15 on the iTunes electronica chart five weeks in a row and was a heavy rotation pick on XM/Sirius chill, Below Zero FM in San Francisco, and Smoothlounge.com as well as a host of club mix shows worldwide. Later that year D:Fuse unveiled his new live concept \\"Bring The Drums\\" residency to a capacity crowd at San Francisco's renowned Ruby Skye. The new show spotlighted D:Fuse performing on his most expansive drum kit yet, featuring his signature blend of congas and bongos plus tom- toms, snares and cymbals. D:Fuse rolled out the tour to cities across the nation and later brought \\"BTD\\" to tours in Asia and Eastern Europe; concluding the tour as a headliner at the massive closing party of the Kazatip festival in Ukraine drawing over 10,000 people. In 2007 D:Fuse began work on his release \\"Thanks for Listening (The Club Singles '98-'08 Re:Mixed Re:Mastered)\\". He spent over a year in the studio completely reworking, remixing, and remastering his classic tracks into a 12-song package including \\"She Rides\\", \\"Everything With You\\", \\"Living the Dream\\" and a brand new collaboration with The Scumfrog titled \\"Stereo & Video\\". Tracks from the album were immediately hammered by Armin Van Buren, Paul Van Dyk, Paul Oakenfold, Kosheen, Matt Darey, Solarstone, and Andy Moor and the album received solid reviews in M8, IDJ, and DJ Mag Ukraine as well as a plethora of websites internationally. D:Fuse can currently be heard on \\"The People's Mix\\" in podcast form. D:Fuse recently celebrated his 250th \\"People's Mix\\" broadcast. D:Fuse also works to further good causes. In 2004 he co-created the \\"Beats Against Bush\\" tour alongside Richard Vission and worked nationally with the Drug Policy Alliance against the Rave Act in 2003. Today he is organizing \\"Earth:66\\" (www.earth66ride.com), a charity bike ride dedicated to raising money and awareness for earth-related issues and for the organization Global Green. In 2009 D:Fuse wrapping up studio sessions with Mike Hiratzka to complete their newest mix album series titled \\"Clubbing in Lost Angeles\\" which features 11 tracks from the Lost Angeles recordings catalogue. It seamlessly intertwines club hits like \\"Massif\\", \\"Perfection\\", and \\"Everything With You\\" with all new productions including \\"Tobias\\" and D & H remixes of Govinda's \\"Can't Forget The Day\\" and Nosmo & Kris B√≠s \\"One For The Road\\".

They are the only family in the superfamily Parasitoidea. Relatively large for mites, their color is often yellowish to dark brown. The family as a whole preys on a wide variety of microarthropods and nematodes, with individual species usually having a narrower range of prey. The family contains two subfamilies, 29 genera, and around 400 species. The subfamily Pergamasinae is normally found in the soil, and dispersal via phoresy is not known in this subfamily. It contains 9 genera. Most species are bisexual. The subfamily Parasitinae is normally found in nests of small animals or insects or in decaying organic matter, from seaweed to forest litter. This subfamily contains 20 genera. These mites disperse via phoresy in the deuteronymph stage of their life cycle. The genus Parasitellus is associated with bumblebees, and other genus with other bees, leading to the common name \\"bee mites\\". Other genus disperse on various beetles, leading to the name \\"beetle mites\\" which is also shared with the order of mites Oribatida, who have the name for a different reason.

This character distinguishes it from other Agaricus species, such as Agaricus xanthodermus, a mildly toxic species which has a phenolic or medicinal odor, and bruises fleetingly yellow. Fieldmarks of Agaricus albolutescens include a tendency to discolor tawny-brown, rather than merely yellow, and chocolate-brown free gills.Arora, pg 336 Agaricus silvicola is very similar but has a less dramatic bruising reaction, more yellowish than tawny, a normal rather than stocky stature, and slightly smaller spores. A. albolutescens and A. silvicola represent a single polymorphic species or a species complex.Arora, pg 335Zeller, S.M. (1938). New or Noteworthy Agarics from the Pacific Coast States. Mycologia 30: 468-474. Description=Pileus= The cap is 6‚Äì12 cm broad, and convex; it becomes planoconvex to planodepressed. The margin is incurved, then decurved, overlapping the gills. Occasionally, it is wavy and appendiculate from veil fragments. The surface is dry and white; when bruised, it turns tawny-brown. The context varies from 1.5 to 2.0 cm thick; it is firm and turns pale-peach when cut. When the flesh is dry, odor and taste is musty.Kerrigan, Richard W. (1986). The Agaricales (Gilled Fungi) of California. 6. Agaricaceae. Mad River Press: Eureka, California. p. 62 Albolutescens, in botanical Latin, which has developed a much richer vocabulary of color words than the Romans had, signifies a yellowish white. =Lamellae= The gills are free, close, and, at first, pallid, though they then turn a pale pinkish-tan. As it ages, A. albsolutescens is dark chocolate- brown in color. The lamellulae are in five to six series.Arora, pg 315 =Stipe= The stipe is 2.0-7.0 cm long, 1.5-3.0 cm thick, and more or less equal except for a bulbous base. In addition, it has a narrow, cottony central core. The surface of the apex is palled and finely striate, while the lower stipe can vary from glabrous to sparsely covered with whitish fibrils, occasionally sheathed with cottony-floccose veil remnants. Like the cap, it yellows. The partial veil is layered. The surface underneath can be cottony or fibrillose. Sometimes, it fragments, leaving scattered cottony patches over a membranous-tomentose basement layer. The annulus is superior, thin, and initially erect, then pendulous.Arora, pg 331 =Spores= Spores are 6.0-7.5 x 4.0-5.0 ¬µm, elliptical, and inequilateral in profile. In addition, they are smooth, moderately thick-walled, and have an inconspicuous hilar appendage. Their germ pore is absent.

Today, Manchester is the second largest centre of the creative and digital industries in Europe.. Most notable television exports include the longest running serial soap drama in the world in Coronation Street and the longest running documentary series in 7 Up!. A wide array of award-winning British television programmes have originated from, and often been set in Manchester, such as Coronation Street, A Question of Sport, Dragon's Den, The Royle Family, University Challenge, Mastermind, Songs of Praise, Top of the Pops, It's a Knockout, World in Action, Seven Up!, Jewel in the Crown, Brideshead Revisited, Stars in Their Eyes, The Krypton Factor, Red Dwarf, Life on Mars, Cold Feet, Cracker and The Street. In the BFI TV list of greatest British television programmes decided by industry professionals in 2000, nine television programmes which were devised and produced in Manchester made the top 50. Manchester was given the nickname 'Granadaland', as many of the city's successful programmes were produced by Granada Television and its influential chairman Sidney Bernstein actively encouraged this nickname to promote Manchester and the North West. The company was based at Granada Studios in Manchester and was considered one of the best commercial television companies in the world by the Financial Times and The Independent. Granada had its own entertainment complex showcasing its television exports to the public. Eventually Granada took over eleven other franchisees through a series of hostile bids to form ITV in 2004, and consequently a more unified ITV corporate brand appeared. The new MediaCityUK in Salford forms part of the major decentralisation of the BBC. The corporation opted to move to MediaCityUK in 2004 as a replacement for its ageing Mancunian studios at New Broadcasting House and Granada Studios - the latter being partly owned by both ITV and the BBC through 3SixtyMedia. At the same time, BBC Television Centre was also coming to the end of its lifespan, so the BBC decided to split departments between existing facilities in London and Greater Manchester. The BBC currently has a major broadcast division business operating here under the BBC North Group it comprises the departments BBC Breakfast, BBC Sport, BBC Children's, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Learning, BBC Research & Development and BBC Philharmonic presently broadcasting and producing. ITV also has a major division of its business based here ITV Studios which is responsible for all UK and international production. The Guardian newspaper was founded in Manchester as the Manchester Guardian and the city's regional newspaper, the Manchester Evening News is the second most popular regional newspaper in the UK after the Evening Standard. Television broadcasting ABC Weekend Television's northern studios in Didsbury Dickenson Road Studios in Longsight, Manchester New Broadcasting House which is often referred to as BBC Manchester Studios Exterior scenes of Coronation Street are filmed in at the Granada Studios in Manchester City Centre Television broadcasts spread to the North West relatively late ‚Äì the first monochrome 405 line television transmitter covering the area (from Holme Moss) did not open until 1951. Commercial TV began in May 1956 and the signals were broadcast from Winter Hill. =BBC in Manchester= The former home of Mancunian Films, a converted Methodist Church on Dickinson Road, Rusholme, was bought by the BBC in 1954 to become its first regional TV production studio. The facilities at Studio A, recalled Olive Shapley, a BBC television producer from 1959, consisted of > one studio and very cramped make up and other production facilities, with a > canteen and a few poky little dressing rooms. We coped well enough, though I > do remember apologising sometimes to guests who clearly found the place not > quite up to their expectations of the BBC.Olive Shapley Broadcasting a Life, > London: Scarlet Press, p.162 The first edition of Top of the Pops was broadcast on New Year's Day 1964 from the studio,Spencer Leigh Obituary: Johnnie Stewart, The Independent, 4 May 2005 and Yorkshire host Jimmy Savile stated: \\"anything they didn't want to do in London, they slung up into this old church. And, of course, they didn't want anything to do with pop music so that was our place\\". But when viewing figures took off the BBC decided that the pop show had to be broadcast from London, although it remained based in Manchester for three years before moving to Lime Grove Studios in west London in 1967. The BBC's northern Outside Broadcast base was at the former Longsight Free Christian Church, on the corner of Plymouth Grove and Birch Lane in Longsight. The BBC began regional TV news bulletins in 1957 from Broadcasting House in Piccadilly, and in September 1969 its Look North evening regional opt-out became part of the Nationwide programme (the former evolved into the current programme North West Tonight). The 1970s marked a change for the BBC's involvement in Manchester and it appeared that the city had been given more licence to produce programmes for national consumption. The revival of It's a Knockout was one such success; with the show attracting only 100,000 viewers the BBC hired a reluctant Stuart Hall to present the show in a new format, and within a few years the show was attracting 15 million viewers nationally. 1975 also marked the year Manchester finally got its purpose-built BBC studio in the form of New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in Manchester City centre. The new Network Production Centre (NPC) in the north of England was given licence to produce programmes for national consumption, one of its first successes . Programmes including A Question of Sport, Mastermind, and Real Story, are made at New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road, just south of the city centre. The hit series Cutting It was set in the city's Northern Quarter and ran on BBC1 for five series. Life on Mars was set in 1973 Manchester. Also, The Street, winner of a BAFTA and International Emmy Award in 2007 is set in Manchester. Manchester is also the regional base for the BBC One North West Region so programmes like North West Tonight are produced here. The BBC intends to relocate large numbers of staff and facilities from London to MediaCityUK at Salford Quays. The Children's (CBBC), Comedy, Sport (BBC Sport) and New Media departments are all scheduled to move before 2010. ‚Ä¢ =Demise of ABC Television= Between 1956 and 1969, the old Capitol Theatre at the junction of Parrs Wood Road and School Lane served as the northern studios of ITV station ABC Weekend Television. Early episodes of The Avengers and programmes such as Opportunity Knocks were made in the studios. ABC ceased to use the site in 1968 when it lost its ITV franchise, on its merger with fellow ITV company Rediffusion. The site was then used briefly by Yorkshire Television until its own facilities in Leeds were ready. In 1971, the studios were acquired by Manchester Polytechnic, who used it for cinema, television studies and theatre. The building was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for a residential development, but the name lives on in the form of a new theatre space in the heart of the M.M.U. campus in the All Saints area along Oxford Road, just to the south of Manchester city centre. =Granada Television Studios, Manchester= Granada Television in Manchester was arguably ITV's most successful franchisee. Kenneth Clark stated as early as 1958 that: \\"We did not quite foresee how much Granada would develop a character which distinguishes it most markedly from the other programmes companies and from the BBC.\\" It was the only original franchisee formed in 1954 that kept its licence for North West England into the 21st century, fuelled by commercially successful productions such as its flagship programme, Coronation Street. Granada Television's parent company Granada PLC took over the 11 other ITV franchise holders from 1994 and by 2004 only a Carlton Communications stood in Granada's way. The formation of ITV was reported as a merger, but it was in effect a takeover by Granada who would own 68% of the new shares with Carlton getting 32%. Granada Television's on-screen identity no longer exists due to the formation of ITV and Granada Television productions are now known with the ITV Studios. The first ITV franchisee was Granada Television, which remained the service provider until it was absorbed into the ITV Network in 2004. Granada has its headquarters in a distinctive purpose built building on Quay Street, in the Castlefield area of the city. Granada produces the world's oldest and most watched television soap opera, Coronation Street, which is screened five times a week on ITV. = BBC and ITV move out of Manchester City Centre to MediaCityUK = By the 2000s, Manchester had proved itself as a key base for the ITV brand with its Granada franchise and BBC North at New Broadcasting House. Granada Television based in Manchester was one of ITV's most successful franchises along with London Weekend Television (LWT), which was often thanks to successful programmes produced in Manchester such as Coronation Street. The BBC considers Manchester as one of the two main BBC production bases (London) in the United Kingdom. The turn of the millennium also saw Manchester gain its own television channel, Channel M, owned by the Guardian Media Group and operated since 2000. The launch of the station on digital satellite services in April 2006 led to an increase of the station's local output (news, sport, entertainment etc.) until major cutbacks led to the end of in-house programming in March 2010. The vacuum for local programming has since been filled by Manchester.tv and QuaysNews.net In June 2004, it was revealed that the BBC planned to redevelop the aging New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in Manchester and with it will take the opportunity to transfer 1000 jobs out of London to bring investment in Northern England to the level the BBC invest in London, Birmingham and Bristol. The Studios, which opened in 2013, is a separate studio complex at MediaCityUK, operated by dock10. The Studios is home to shows such as The Jeremy Kyle Show, The Voice UK and Match of the Day. =Production companies based in Manchester= *3SixtyMedia ‚Äì a joint venture between Granada Manchester and BBC North in Manchester with primary aim to pool resources. The company is beneficial to both as programmes produced for BBC are sometimes made by Granada Manchester such as University Challenge at The Manchester Studios. *Red Production Company ‚Äì formed by Nicola Schindler who left Granada Manchester after ITV plc was formed in 2004.

The British Broadcasting Company was granted a licence for AM radio broadcasts in October of the same year and inaugurated a station called 2LO in London on 14 November 1922, followed the next day by 2ZY, the BBC's official Manchester station. 2ZY made regular transmissions from the Metropolitan-Vickers factory in Trafford Park on 800 kHz (375 metres) Medium Wave). In July 1925 the BBC opened a much higher powered transmitter at Daventry, Northamptonshire, which broadcast on 187.5 kHz (1562 metres) Long wave and was receivable across most of Britain. The station was called 5XX and it conducted its first experimental stereo broadcast from a concert in Manchester. The 5XX Long Wave transmitter beamed the right channel and all the local BBC Medium Wave transmitters broadcast the left channel. The BBC opened a central Control Room on Piccadilly in Manchester in 1929 from where many network radio programmes were made or transmitted and several technical innovations were installed ‚Äì including volume metres, the precursor of the PPM. Radio plays and concerts were staged in an old converted repertory theatre hall in Hulme which was renamed 'The Radio Playhouse'. The 2ZY Orchestra created in 1922 went on to play a pivotal role in the establishment of the Northern Wireless Orchestra (and later the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra). Programme content made in Manchester included radio features on subjects like Cotton and Coal. One example, Joan Littlewood and Olive Shapley's The Classic Soil (1939), on the Manchester poor, was inspired by an assertion of Fredrick Engels that the city was \\"the classic soil . . . where capitalism flourished\\".Allan Shaw Obituary: Olive Shapley, The Independent, 20 March 1999 Many well-known networked radio comedies and concerts as well as Woman's Hour were produced in Manchester. It was not until the late 1960s that true local radio services began across Britain and BBC Radio Manchester was first launched in 1970 on 95.3 MHz VHF. The Medium Wave frequency of 1458 kHz (206 metres) was opened later. Independent Commercial radio began in Britain in 1973 so on 2 April the following year Piccadilly Radio was launched in Manchester on 1146 kHz (261 metres) medium wave and 97.0 MHz vhf (the frequency was changed in 1986). The BBC's original radio studios became cramped and outdated so all operations were moved to a large new purpose built studio complex on Oxford Road which was named New Broadcasting House (known as NBH) which were in use for both TV and radio production by the spring of 1976 (the old studios on Piccadilly were finally closed in 1981). The number of hours of productions made in Manchester then increased until at its peak in the 1990s around 20% of the output on the newly opened BBC Radio 5 Live in 1994. Around 10% of BBC Radio 4 programming and a daily afternoon show on BBC Radio 1 (Mark & Lard) were all being made in and broadcast from Manchester. The commercial station Piccadilly Radio was re-branded in 1988 when the services were split in two: AM became Piccadilly Gold and FM was named Key 103. A number of new local commercial services were licensed by the Radio Authority in the late 1980s and 1990s. This proliferation has meant that the radio market in Manchester now has the highest number of local radio stations outside London including BBC Radio Manchester, Key 103, Greatest Hits Manchester, Capital Manchester, Heart North West, Smooth North West, 106.1 Real Radio XS, Gold and The Revolution BBC Radio Manchester returned to its original title in 2006 after becoming BBC GMR in 1988. Throughout the last 40 years Manchester has also heard many pirate, student, temporary (Restricted Service Licence) and unofficial radio stations. Student radio stations include Shock Radio and Utter Radio at the University of Salford, Fuse FM at the University of Manchester and MMU Radio at the Manchester Metropolitan University. A community radio network is coordinated by Radio Regen, with stations covering the South Manchester communities of Ardwick, Longsight and Levenshulme (All FM 96.9) and Wythenshawe (Wythenshawe FM 97.2Mhz).See Radio at the Ofcom web site and subpages, especially the directory of analogue radio stations, the map Commercial Radio Styles (PDF), and the map Community Radio in the UK (PDF). Retrieved 6 November 2007. One of the earliest pirate stations, started in 1979 on 94.6 MHz FM, was called Andromeda which broadcast to the entire conurbation from various locations on the hills around Tameside. Defunct (official) radio stations include Sunset 102 (which became Kiss 102, now Capital Manchester), and KFM (which became Signal Cheshire, now Imagine FM). These stations, as well as many 1990s pirates, played a significant role in the city's House music culture, also known as the Madchester scene, which was based around clubs like The Ha√ßienda (which had its own shows on Sunset and on Kiss 102). Some of the best known voices on UK radio began their careers in (or featured regularly on) radio made in Manchester including: radio producer and author Karl Pilkington, of The Ricky Gervais Show; Allan Beswick, Andy Crane, Terry Christian, David Dunne, Nemone, Andy Kershaw, Andy Peebles, Brian Redhead, James Stannage, Mike Sweeny, Julian Worricker. Film Filming Captain America: The First Avenger in Manchester, 2010. Manchester is featured in several Hollywood films such as My Son, My Son! (1940), directed by Charles Vidor and starring Brian Aherne and Louis Hayward.The city was also mentioned frequently in Grand Hotel (1932), in which an industrialist, played by Wallace Beery, frantically tries to secure a deal with a cotton company based in Manchester, and it was also mentioned very briefly by Myrna Loy in Too Hot to Handle (1938). Others include Velvet Goldmine starring Ewan McGregor, and Sir Alec Guinness's The Man in the White Suit. More recently, the entire city of Manchester is engulfed in runaway fires in the 2002 film 28 Days Later. The 2004 Japanese animated film, Steamboy was partly set in Manchester, during the times of the industrial revolution. The city is also home to the Manchester International Film Festival and has held the Commonwealth film festival. In recent years a number of Hollywood films have been filmed in Manchester, with the city historic Northern Quarter district used due to its pre-WW2 architecture. In 2010, the car chase scene in Captain America: The First Avenger was filmed on Dale Street in the Northern Quarter. Producers chose Manchester because of its resemblance to 1940s New York City with its high buildings dating from pre-WW2 and the site is a shortlisted UNESCO world heritage site. In 2004, the Northern Quarter district was also used for the filming of Alfie. The 2009 film Sherlock Holmes was extensively filmed in Manchester alongside London and Liverpool. The movie was filmed in such locations as the Northern Quarter, Jersey Street in Ancoats and inside Manchester Town Hall. Since 2007, Manchester has been the home of the biennial Insight Film Festival. The most recent Festival was held in March 2013'Five questions with‚Ä¶ John Forrest', Creative Times, 6 March 2013 Newspapers The Daily Express Building, Manchester, built in the 1930s but since vacated by the Daily Express. Newspaper printing still takes place at the building At certain points in the 1800s Manchester had up to seven newspapers ‚Äì this was not unusual, many towns and cities had a plethora of papers at this time. The Manchester Guardian however being the largest, selling more than any other regional newspaper (average of 51,000 in 1837). The others were at various times: Manchester Herald, Manchester Advertiser, Manchester Times, Manchester Chronicle, Manchester Courier, Manchester Voice. The Guardian newspaper was founded in Manchester in 1821. It no longer has a head office in Manchester after the sale of the Manchester Evening News to Trinity Mirror, which is now based in Oldham. Many management functions of The Guardian were moved to London in 1964. Its sister publication, the Manchester Evening News, has the largest circulation of a UK regional evening newspaper. It is free in the city centre, but paid for in the suburbs. Despite its title, it is available all day. The Metro North West is available free at Metrolink stops, rail stations and other busy transit locations. The MEN group distributes several local weekly free papers. ‚Ä¢ For many years most of the national newspapers had offices in Manchester: The Daily Telegraph, Daily Express, Daily Mail, The Daily Mirror, The Sun. Only The Daily Sport remains based in Manchester. At its height, 1,500 journalists were employed, though in the 1980s office closures began and today the \\"second Fleet Street\\" is no more. An attempt to launch a Northern daily newspaper, the North West Times, employing journalists made redundant by other titles, closed in 1988.[155] Another attempt was made with the North West Enquirer, which hoped to provide a true \\"regional\\" newspaper for the North West, much in the same vein as the Yorkshire Post does for Yorkshire or The Northern Echo does for the North East; it folded in October 2006. ‚Ä¢ There are several local lifestyle magazines, including YQ Magazine and Moving Manchester. Since 2013, the online news platform Prolific North, has been covering the media and marketing communities of the North from its base in Manchester. With over 100,000 unique readers a month, the title has established itself as the biggest media outlet outside London spanning an array of initiatives, awards and three annual expos. Another publisher is The Manchester Gazette, an online news organisation covering the City and 10 Boroughs of Greater Manchester. A new addition is Business Manchester, a good news business only website, catering for the Greater Manchester business community, which has caught the attention of circa 20,000 business readers in the region. Magazines There are several local lifestyle magazines, including YQ Magazine and Moving Manchester. City Life was a listings magazine which was published fortnightly between 1983‚Äì2005 until it was absorbed into the MEN. A single edition of Time Out Manchester was published in 2006. Digital Media Manchester has a vibrant digital media community ranging from agencies to specialised creative companies such as One Day Agency - Digital Marketing Agency.

Disposable grills are made from a lightweight aluminium material and use charcoal for the heat source. The grill is self-contained, meaning that all elements needed for cooking the food are included: Foil pan, grill top, stand (optional), charcoal, starter sheet, ignition fluid.  History and popularity  Confusion may arise between disposable grills and portable grills. Portable barbecue grills are small and lightweight, and are often used for camping. These have been in existence for several decades, but have certain limitations, namely cleaning, transport and safety. The disposable BBQ grill is a newer phenomenon, first appearing in Europe in the late 1990s.  Use  Disposable grills are suitable for a variety of uses, such as camping, outdoor recreation, tailgating, apartment dwellers, entertaining or beach parties. To start the grill, the user removes the outer packaging and lights the corner of the starter sheet. The sheet will ignite the charcoal and continue to burn for about 15 minutes, heating the charcoal. No lighter fluid is required. When the coals reach an even and optimal temperature, any food types which are commonly grilled can be placed on the grill top and cooked, including steaks, seafood, chicken, kebabs, vegetables, burgers and sausages. The charcoal will remain hot enough to continue cooking for up to 1.5 hours after ignition. The remaining charcoal is then extinguished with water, sand, or dirt and the entire grill can be recycled or disposed.  Charcoal types  Disposable grills use either charcoal briquettes or all-natural lump charcoal as their fuel source. The charcoal, when burned, will transform into embers radiating the heat necessary to cook food. There is contention among grilling enthusiasts as to what type of charcoal is best for grilling. Users of charcoal briquets emphasize the uniformity in size, burn rate, and heat creation exemplified by briquets. Users of all-natural lump charcoal emphasize the subtle smoky aromas, high heat production, and lack of chemicals, binders and fillers often present in briquets.

Anfa Airport was one of three airports serving the Casablanca area, the others being the newer and larger Mohammed V International Airport and the Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport. Anfa Airport is now closed, and its buildings and runways have been demolished. History Built in the 1920s by the French colonial government, Anfa Airport was the primary airport for Casablanca until the United States Air Force closed its base at Nouasseur in 1959. Nouasseur Air Base has been expanded over the years to handle large jet aircraft and has become Casablanca's primary airport. During World War II, Anfa Airport was taken over by the Vichy French government and used as an airport as well as an air base for the Vichy French Air Force () with its limited aircraft allowed by the armistice with Nazi Germany. It was also used by Deutsche Luft Hansa and German military transports and was depicted in the fictional 1942 film Casablanca. Anfa Airport was one of the primary Allied objectives during Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, and was seized in the initial landings in the Casablanca area. After its capture by Allied forces, it functioned as an Allied military airfield throughout the remainder of the war, supporting the United States Army during the North African Campaign, and also as an Air Transport Command cargo hub on the North African Route. It served as a transit point for United States Army Air Forces aircraft heading to England to equip the Eighth Air Force, as well as for the Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces in the Mediterranean Theater, as part of the southern air transport route from the United States via Brazil and Dakar in Senegal. It was returned to civilian control late in 1945. The airport is now closed and is undergoing a major urbanization project. Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II.

The teams began negotiations with multiple valley cities and Indian communities, with the Salt River Pima‚ÄìMaricopa Indian Community coming out on top with a 20-year commitment from the teams to the facility. Construction began on November 17, 2009, with a ground-breaking ceremony by Diamondbacks President and CEO Derrick Hall,http://archive.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/2009/11/17/20091117sr- ballpark1118.html as an aggressive, fast-tracked schedule‚Äîto get the stadium done by the 2011 spring-training season‚Äîbegan.

Luxury suites, three party pavilions, and a kids zone are further amenities. Each team has an clubhouse (with offices, fitness, and locker rooms), six full-size practice fields (one with the same dimensions as the respective team's home stadium), two infield-only practice diamonds, and batting cages. The Diamondbacks occupy the facilities along the left field and the Rockies are in the right-field area. Several points of access to the stadium bring visitors in through the middle of the practice fields and batting facilities. The complex also has two lit soccer fields and a 3-acre man-made lake which is home to 17,000 fish. The stadium was completed on time, with the first game being played between the Diamondbacks and Rockies on February 26, 2011. The ceremonial first pitch was delivered by Salt River Pima‚ÄìMaricopa Indian Tribal President Diane Enos and Vice President Martin Harvier. The national anthem was performed by the Salt River Elementary School choir. The Rockies won the first game, 8-7, after 10 innings of play. It has opened to rave reviews from the athletes, fans, and critics. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said \\"Everyone told me it was remarkable. It's even better than that.\\" According to the Arizona Republic, the Cactus League generates more than $300 million a year in economic impact to the greater Phoenix metropolitan-area economy. The new Salt River Fields at Talking Stick complex is the latest of eight new stadiums built in the Valley of the Sun over the past 20 years. The Arizona Republic newspaper reports that more than $500 million has been spent on ‚Äúbuilding eight new stadiums and renovating two others for the 15 teams in the Valley.\\" Attendance set a new record at 2011 Cactus League games with 1.59 million attending games at the various stadiums in the Phoenix metro area. Much of the attendance surge is attributed to the new Salt Rivers Fields at Talking Stick venue that accounted for 22% of the Cactus League attendance. In the inaugural spring-training season at the park, the Arizona Diamondbacks enjoyed a record-breaking 189,737 spectators at 17 spring-training games, with an average of 11,161 spectators per game, up more than 90% from 2010.

It is located along North Dakota Highway 14 in the eastern part of the county, east of Souris. The town is virtually abandoned, and the 2000 Census did not record a population. The post office closed in 1984, and it is now part of zip code 58783 covered by the post office in Souris.Zip Code Lookup Carbury is also designated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency as a port of entry between the United States and Canada. History Carbury is named after the village of Carbury in County Kildare, Ireland. Founded in 1901 as a station on the Great Northern Railway, the post office first opened April 16, 1906. Though the town has been known as Carbury since its founding, it was originally intended to be named Roth, which is a town roughly to the west. However, due to a mixup by railroad officials or the Secretary of State, depending on who tells the story, the townsite names were accidentally switched when the wrong signs were posted. The mistake was never corrected. Carbury's original post office was assigned the zip code 58724.U.S. Postal Service, Find a Postmaster The post office closed in 1984, and mail service was merged with Souris, North Dakota. The town experienced a top population of 50 in 1920, which had dwindled to 5 by 1980. Norwegian settlers from Polk County, Minnesota, established a settlement near Carbury in 1883, reportedly becoming the first Norwegians in Bottineau County.

She was Minister of Family- Consumption- Aid and Immigration from 1954-1966. She was also the first woman in Sweden to be acting Prime Minister (1958). Biography Ulla Lindstr√∂m was the daughter of the right wing Nils Wohlin, Minister of Trade 1923‚Äì24 and Minister of Finance in 1928‚Äì29, and the piano teacher Gunilla Wohlin. Her parents divorced when she was ten, and she grew up with her mother. She graduated as a teacher in 1933, and worked as the editor of the papers Sveriges folkskoll√§rarinnors tidning in 1934‚Äì46, and V√•r bostad in 1937‚Äì1946. She became a social democrat as a student, and was the chairperson of the social democratic women's club Allm√§nna kvinnoklubben in Stockholm 1935‚Äì1945 and an elected member of the Stockholm city council in 1942‚Äì1945. She was a member of parliament in 1946‚Äì1970 and a consultant in the Trade department 1947‚Äì1954. Lindstr√∂m was a delegat of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947‚Äì1966, and chairperson of R√§dda Barnen 1971‚Äì1989. Ulla Lindstr√∂m served as Minister of Family, Consumption, Aid and Immigration from 1954 to 1966. Her appointment was encouraged by the Social Democratic Women, who demanded female representation on all levels, a demand which Tage Erlander wished to fulfill. During her tenure, she was the only woman in the government, and unusual as a female minister not only in Sweden but also internationally. Her appointment was very popular among women, and she continued being popular among women during her tenure. Personally, she believed that she was not the only woman who deserved a place in the government, and she was disappointed that she continued to be the only one of her gender in the government during her tenure, despite the fact that she repeatedly suggested that Inga Thorsson deserved to receive a ministerial post. Lindstr√∂m was controversial and caused great attention in the media when she refused to curtsey to Queen Elizabeth II in 1956: this was reported in international press, and regarded as an insult by royalists, and as a demonstration of equality in the eyes of others. In 1958, she served as acting Prime minister of Sweden during the summer break of the Prime Minister, becoming the first person of her gender to serve in that function. She resigned under protest in 1966 when the government did not fulfil their promise of an increased aid.

Opened in March 2012, it is primarily the spring training home of the Boston Red Sox, replacing earlier separated facilities at City of Palms Park and Boston's former (1993‚Äì2011) minor league complex, also located in downtown Fort Myers. The naming rights were purchased by JetBlue, an airline with major operations at Boston's Logan International Airport since 2004. History In 2008, the Red Sox began exploring the possibility of relocating their spring training facility. Their previous spring training facility, City of Palms Park, was lacking the modern amenities that other spring training ball parks had and was located two and half miles away from the team's minor league complex. Red Sox CEO Mike Dee visited Sarasota to talk with city officials about the possibility of the team moving there. Sarasota County commissioners then voted 4-0 to approve the purchase of land for a Red Sox spring training facility. Fearing the possibility of losing the Red Sox the Lee County Commission voted in October 2008 to agree to build a new ballpark for the Red Sox. The Red Sox also signed a 30-year lease with the city of Fort Myers. The following April it was announced that the new stadium would be located on a lot north of Southwest Florida International Airport. When the Red Sox announced they would stay in Fort Myers they stated the new stadium would be similar to Fenway Park. The architecture team was led by local Fort Myers firm Parker/Mudgett/Smith Architects, Inc. and Populous and assisted by Boston firm Quirk. The groundbreaking was in August 2010 and construction commenced in February 2011. JetBlue N605JB celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Boston Red Sox baseball team. Design The ballpark's field has exactly the same dimensions as Fenway Park and some of the unique features as the Boston ballpark as well. The most notable is a replica of the Green Monster in left field. However, unlike the one in Boston, the Green Monster in Fort Myers has seating within the wall. There are three rows of seats carved into the middle portion of the wall. Separating the seats inside the wall from the field is a net so that balls cannot go inside the seated area. Any ball hit off the net is considered to be in play.. The space in the Green Monster where the seats are behind the netting was necessitated by Florida Hurricane building codes as a wall of would have exceeded Florida code. Another unique feature about the Green Monster is that like the original one in Fenway Park, it has a manual scoreboard. The scoreboard is the same, 1934-vintage unit that had been used for decades in Fenway Park, but before being installed in Fort Myers was in a storage facility in South Dakota. The manual scoreboard is different from the one in Boston though because there is no room behind it where a scoreboard operator can put numbers while the game is going on. Instead, a scoreboard operator works in a room in between the scoreboard and the foul line and has to run out in between innings with a ladder and scoreboard tiles to change the scoreboard. Other features from the ballpark in Boston which are present in the spring training stadium are the triangle, Pesky's Pole, and Lone Red Seat marking the longest home run ever hit in the Fenway's history. One of the signature features of the ballpark is the wavy roof sitting over the seats in the stadium, providing shade for the fans in attendance. The roof also is an example of how the ballpark incorporated its location in Florida into the design of the stadium. The wavy design of the roof resembles the Cypress trees in the surrounding area of the ballpark. In addition, the blocks which make up the ballpark are embedded with sea shells from nearby Sanibel Island. The park also features a lawn in right field, a popular feature in spring training parks. The ballpark's design is also LEED Certified. Features In addition to the ballpark where spring training games are played there is also a state of the art player development complex. Unlike the old spring training ball park, JetBlue Park is located on the same piece of land as the player development complex. The player development complex features six fields that can be used for drills during spring training, injury rehab assignments and many other baseball activities. One of the six practice fields has the same dimensions as Fenway Park. There are two locker rooms, one for the major league players and another one for the minor leaguers. The major league locker room used during spring training has an oval shaped design, is 50,000 square feet, and has lounge areas with flat screen televisions. Opening The first game played in JetBlue park was on March 3, 2012, against Northeastern University. However, the first Grapefruit League game played at the park (the third game overall) was played on March 4, 2012 against the crosstown rival Minnesota Twins. On March 4 the ceremonial first pitch saw eight current players catching, with the balls brought onto the field by Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Luis Tiant, and Dwight Evans. The first homer at the field was hit in the opening game by Lars Anderson and was a grand slam. The home team won, 8‚Äì3. Tenants In addition to serving as the home field for Red Sox spring training games JetBlue Park is the home field for the GCL Red Sox, who play in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL) during the summer. The park also one of the host venues for the annual Roy Hobbs World Series and serves as a venue for local festivals, circuses, conferences, and many other events. In May, 2013, JetBlue Park was the host site for the final round games of the Florida High School Athletic Association's statewide high school baseball championship tournament.

She was one of the most famous female stage artists in Denmark of her time. She was a mentor for many talents, such as for example Louise Phister and her private home was a center of the theatre world. Biography Born in Copenhagen to the compass-maker Peter Christian Bren√∏e and Olave Frederikke Caroline Leth. She was educated in a girls' school until her father was ruined, and was a member in the drama society there. She was also a student of a master of the chapel at the Royal Danish Theatre. She was a tall and blue-eyed blonde. She was accepted as a student at the theatre, where she was given Johanne Rosing as her mentor. She debuted in the title role of Dyveke by on the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen in 1821, and made a great success. She was described as versatile, with a fine singing voice, vivid, and recommended for her natural, sensitive and poetic way of acting, her best interpretation were repressed but strong emotion. Initially much used for the leading roles of heroine, she eventually performed all sorts of parts. She was active on stage until her death. As was common in her time and place, she was active within both opera and theatre. She played heroine in both theatre and opera, often in the part of \\"Nordic maiden\\". She was famed for her parts in the work of Adam Oehlenschl√§ger, and contributed to the breakthrough for the vaudevilles of J. L. Heiberg. S√∏ren Kierkegaard called her an interpreter of femininity. She was one of the strongest speakers in favour of a realistic way of acting at the theatre. She was married in 1823 to the Norwegian violinist Frederik Thorkildsen Wexschall, (separated in 1831) and in 1834 to the actor Peder Nielsen and had one daughter. The fact that she divorced her second spouse in order to marry another was considered scandalous.

Subsistence farming is the primary source of food, though money is obtained by working in forestry, building, selling honey, and other various means. Georg August Schweinfurth, who lived two years among them, declared that before the advent of the slave-raiders, , they numbered at least 300,000. Slave-raiders, and later the dervishes, greatly reduced their numbers, and it was not until the establishment of effective control by the Sudan government (1904‚Äì1906) that recuperation was possible.

When his ship meets at sea with a U.S. Coast Guard cutter near Martha's Vineyard in 1970, Kudirka makes a dramatic leap from the deck, landing on the USCGC Vigilant. He announces that he wishes to defect, but confusion over U.S. policy on defections prevents the Americans from offering him asylum. As the crew of the Vigilant looks on helplessly, Soviet officers are allowed to board the cutter, beat and bind Kudirka, and drag him back to his own ship.

Prior to the Revolution, he served as an officer in Royal Egyptian Air Force. Career In late 1951, Gamal Salem and Anwar Sadat joined the underground Free Officers movement established by Gamal Abdel Nasser. The group's purpose was to overthrow the monarchy of King Farouk, and end the British occupation of Egypt and Sudan. Following the successful overthrow of Farouk in a coup d'√©tat on 23 July 1952, there was disagreement on what was to be done with the deposed monarch. Although Nasser and most of the Free Officers argued that Farouk be ceremoniously exiled from Egypt and Sudan (to Italy, the King's chosen destination), Salem favoured the summary executed of the former King, stating: \\"A head like Farouk's only interests me when it has fallen,\\" and continually insisted this be carried out. Ultimately, the revolutionaries settled on a peaceful exile for Farouk, and Salem was forbidden by Nasser from attending the former King's departure ceremony. Following Farouk's exile, a revolutionary government was formed by the Free Officers, headed by Muhammad Naguib. Eleven months later, the monarchy was abolished, and a republic was declared, with Naguib as President and Prime Minister. Salem gained the post of Communications Minister. Salem was considered a Nasser loyalist and strongly opposed Naguib holding power, many times humiliating the latter and using the Egyptian media against him. Salem headed the 1952 agrarian reform policy, which limited landownership to only 300 feddans, with compensations for those whose land was expropriated. In February 1954, Salem headed a military court which arrested and tried Armoured Corps officers loyal to Naguib. In late October 1954, following an assassination attempt on Nasser by a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Salem was chosen to serve as the chief judge of the military court which sentenced eight Brotherhood leaders to death. However, two sentences were later commuted. Following Nasser's confirmation as President in 1956, Salem later served as Deputy Prime Minister. Salem's health started deteriorating, and his political career faded in 1959 due to his frequent foreign travel for treatment. He died in 1968.

Action The American destroyer , commanded by Lieutenant Commander Walter N. Vernou, was operating off the coast of Ireland in October 1917. On anti- submarine patrols and rescue missions, as well as convoy duty. Operating out of Queenstown, Ireland, she was armed with four guns and eight torpedo tubes. The German submarine ‚Äîon a typical unrestricted U-boat mission ‚Äî was cruising in British waters, attacking Allied shipping. She was armed with a deck gun and torpedoes. On 15 October 1917, Cassin sighted U-61 at about south of Mind Head at 13:30 and from the ship. The German submarine sighted Cassin as well, she immediately submerged and began to flee. A pursuit ensued for an hour; at about 14:30, U-61s commander‚ÄîVictor Dieckmann‚Äîdecided to engage the tailing American warship. The Germans then turned about and surfaced to line up for a shot and fired their last torpedo. Gunner's Mate First Class Osmond Ingram noticed the incoming projectile, he quickly ran over to the depth charge gunners and ordered them to jettison the charges before the torpedo struck them. The torpedo struck the destroyer aft on the port side before this could be done and Ingram was killed in the explosion. The torpedo hit Cassins portside stern, nearly blowing off her rudder. The American destroyer began to steam in circles, but returned a barrage of 4 inch shells which forced the U-boat to dive. Four hits damaged U-61s conning tower which discouraged her commander from continuing to attack. Besides the American sailor killed, nine others were wounded in the action. The dead sailor‚ÄîOsmond Ingram‚Äîwas awarded the Medal of Honor for his service on 15 October. Eventually, another American destroyer and the British sloops HMS Jessamine and Tamarisk arrived on the scene and protected Cassin throughout the night. However, no further U-boat contacts were made. The next morning, Cassin was towed back to Queenstown by Captain Ronald Niel Stuart in .

She first appeared during late- night spin-off Hollyoaks Later in September 2009 as the sister of Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) and mother of Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter). Burrows reprised her role as Kathleen in August 2014, but left again in September.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a592328/hollyoaks- sonny-valentine-to-clash-with-theresas-mum-kathleen.html Creation and development The character of Kathleen was first announced in July 2009 as the mother of Theresa McQueen, another member of the McQueen family. Hollyoaks producers announced that Kathleen would be portrayed by Alison Burrows and would appear in the second series of Hollyoaks Later. Hollyoaks Later producer Bryan Kirkwood described Kathleen's entrance storyline in an interview with Digital Spy: \\"Theresa gets a modelling job in the City and wants to kill two birds with one stone and visit her mum Kathleen in prison while she's there. Jorgie Porter's really blossomed over the last year and turns out some emotional stuff when she meets her screen mum.\\" Following her Hollyoaks Later appearance, Kathleen made a full appearance in Hollyoaks in December 2009. A Hollyoaks spokesperson commented on Kathleen's arrival, saying: \\"Theresa's devastated when her mum gives her the brush off but she's soon back with her tail between her legs towards the end of the year in time for Christmas, though. Just how will Theresa react to her mum wanting to be a part of her life again? And how will Myra cope with her sister's sudden reappearance?\\" In February 2010, Inside Soap revealed the character would leave later in the month. In October 2010, it was announced that Burrows would reprise her role in December 2010, reintroduced by series producer Paul Marquess in a storyline which features Kathleen blackmailing her family after discovering one of the McQueens' \\"darkest secrets\\". Jorgie Porter later expressed her excitement over Kathleen's return: \\"I love working with Ali. The scenes we do together are so intense ‚Äî I hope she stays at Hollyoaks for a lot longer this time.\\" Marquess later announced a Hollyoaks late-night special called Hollyoaks: King of Hearts, which would focus on the McQueens attempts to collect money to pay Kathleen after her threats to report Theresa for the murder of Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle). Storylines Kathleen first appears when Theresa visits her in a prison in London. Kathleen is not happy to learn that Theresa is staying with Myra, so tells her to move back with her grandmother. Kathleen then tells Theresa that her boyfriend Alec has asked her to move to Spain with him after she is released, before adding that Theresa is not invited to join her. After a small argument, Kathleen returns to her cell, leaving Theresa in tears. Kathleen is released from prison months later and tells Theresa she is coming for Christmas. The rest of the McQueens are sceptical, which proves correct when she does not arrive. Several days later, Kathleen arrives in Hollyoaks in Alec's sports car, claiming the pair have split up. She asks Myra for money, which Theresa's father left for her. Myra refuses and tells her to leave before Theresa finds her. Later, Theresa meets Kathleen just as she is leaving the village. Kathleen, not wanting to disappoint her daughter, claims she has come to stay. Kathleen begins to buy Theresa expensive gifts. Theresa is desperate to believe her mother has changed. However, Kathleen encourages Theresa to shoplift, which causes more tension between Kathleen and the rest of the McQueens. Kathleen tells Theresa they should run away together to London, to which Theresa agrees. Myra and Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) confront Kathleen before she leaves and reveal that she has been stealing money from deceased Tina Reilly's (Leah Hackett) bank account. Theresa refuses to believe Myra or Jacqui and prepares to leave. After a fight breaks out, Theresa is forced to choose to go with her mother to London or stay in the village. Theresa decides to stay in Hollyoaks as Kathleen leaves. Kathleen returns in December 2010 after being caught using fake money. Kathleen is taken to the McQueens by police detective constable Ethan Scott (Craig Vye). Theresa refuses to have anything to do with her mother. Later, Kathleen discovers that Theresa had a daughter, and her cousin Carmel Valentine (Gemma Merna) is trying to kidnap her. Kathleen is suspicious, demanding to know why. She then realises that the baby is Carmel's husband Calvin's daughter. After she questions Theresa, Kathleen learns that Theresa killed Calvin. Kathleen confronts Carmel and informs the family that she won't report Carmel to the police of Calvin's murder if Carmel terminates her parental rights to Theresa's baby and the McQueens give her money. The McQueens eventually pay Kathleen ¬£2,000 and catch her paying off a policeman. Despite blackmailing her family, Kathleen moves in with Myra. She becomes annoyed when Carmel attempts to snatch Theresa's baby again, so decides to have her granddaughter baptised. After locking Myra and Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) in rooms upstairs, Kathleen, Theresa and Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) have the baby's christening, naming her Kathleen \\"Katy\\" Khloe Angel McQueen, as Theresa had planned to call her. Kathleen left in 2011 after her latest scam to use her daughter's kidney for money came to light. Kathleen returns to Hollyoaks in August 2014 and is run over by Sonny Valentine (Aaron Fontaine), who insists that Kathleen jumped onto the car. She claims to have badly injured her ankle, and Nana forces Carmel to allow her to stay. Kathleen later visits her daughter, Theresa, in prison and promises to find dirt on Sonny, who is stopping Theresa from seeing Kathleen-Angel. Kathleen later drags Mercedes and Jacqui's adoptive daughter, Phoebe McQueen (Mandip Gill) into her plan to try and drive Sonny away, but when Sonny offers Kathleen a load of cash, she disappears. It later transpires that Sonny has beaten Kathleen up severely, and threatens to kill her if she breathes a word to anyone. Kathleen then calls Theresa and tells her that she can't help her escape anymore, which upsets both Theresa and Kathleen. A few weeks later, Sonny walks in on Kathleen attempting to call Carmel, but he stops her and threatens her again. He throws a large amount of money at Kathleen, and as she is picking it all up, Carmel enters and asks Kathleen what Sonny has done to her. The next day, Carmel, Myra, Phoebe and Mercedes visit Kathleen in hospital, where she explains that Sonny beat her up and threatened to kill her if she told anybody. As the McQueens try and take Kathleen to the police station to tell them about Sonny, Kathleen flees and asks a taxi to take her to the airport, intending to use the tickets to Spain that Sonny bought her. Before leaving, she tells Carmel, Myra, Phoebe and Mercedes that Sonny is very dangerous, and that she doesn't want to get hurt again.

This species is extinct and is found in the Pleistocene deposits of Florida.  Etymology  The specific name horridum is Latin for \\"rough\\" or \\"shaggy\\" and does not mean \\"horrid\\". Shell description Like other species in the subfamily Vasinae, Hystrivasum horridum shells are large, thick and heavy. They are vase-shaped, in the sense that they are biconical. The shells have moderate spires, and have several plaits on the columella. Hystrivasum horridum, formerly Vasum horridum, belongs to an extinct group that is easily distinguished from modern Vasum by the presence of two sets of spines or nodes located on the shoulder of the whorls. These spines can be found at the suture and at the periphery of the shoulder. H. horridum has 12-15 wide, scoop-like spines that project almost horizontally from the shoulder. Also, H. horridum has a pronounced \\"waist-like\\" constriction at the base of the shell. These characteristics set it apart from other members of the group. Vokes E. H. 1966.

The band formed in early 1995, seeking to \\"deconstruct rock, only to erase rock and roll entirely from [their] collective minds\\" and \\"then set out to devise a working method for reorganizing the rock and rock, keeping what we feel are its most important core elements.\\" After recording a debut single, they recorded the album in late 1995 at the Solid Sound Studios in Illinois with producer Jim O'Rourke. It was O'Rourke's first recording session with a rock band. The album is often said to \\"deconstruct\\" rock music, and in the words of Allmusic, contains \\"angular guitar attacks, odd skronks, jazzy tones, and a generally deconstructive approach to music into a sound of unparalleled idiosyncrasy.\\" It is also characterized by the unique set up of Todd Rittmann's \\"low\\" guitar complimenting Mark Shippy's \\"high\\" guitar. The album was quickly released in October 1995 by Skin Graft Records on CD and a limited edition aluminium- sleeve LP. Although no singles were released from the LP, the band made one promotional clip for the song \\"State is Bad\\". The album received unanimously positive reviews from music critics, who praised its unique math rock sound that was often compared to Captain Beefheart. Alternative Press said the album \\"reaffirms an ideal: that there's still more to be done with electric guitars,\\" whilst Peter Margasask of The Chicago Reader called the album \\"a stunning debut\\" which proves \\"that noise can be more than just a racket.\\" The band toured in promotion of the album in Europe for six-weeks across twelve countries in 1996. The album continued to be critically acclaimed in later times, and is often said to have established the band's \\"chaotic vibe.\\" In 1999, Alternative Press ranked the album at number 85 in its list of \\"The 90 Greatest Albums of the 90s,\\" whilst in 2014, music journalist Andrew Earles included the album in his book Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981‚Äì1996, and About Entertainment ranked the album at number 4 in their list of the \\"Top 10 Math-Rock Albums.\\" Todd Lamb of SF Weekly called it a \\"noisy classic.\\" Background and recording Long Hair in Three Stages was produced by Jim O'Rourke. U.S. Maple formed as a math rock quartet in early 1995 from the ashes of two different bands at DeKalb's Northern Illinois University; lead singer Al Johnson and \\"high\\" guitarist Mark Shippy were in Shorty, while drummer Pat Samson and \\"low\\" guitarist Todd Rittman spent their time with the Mercury Players. After the breakup of the two bands, the members met to see how they could \\"deconstruct rock, only to leave its most basic elements.\\" Music journalist Andrew Earles said that the band was formed when \\"four members from two different bands met on a Chicago street corner and began discussing how to \\"erase rock and roll from their collective minds,\\"\\" with the band then setting out \\"to devise a working method for reorganizing the rock and rock, keeping what we feel are its most important core elements.\\" Chicago independent record label Skin Graft Records quickly took notice of the band and signed them in the fall of that year. Their first release was the seven-inch single \\"Stuck\\" with the B-side \\"When a Man Says \\"Ow!\\"\\", with both tracks recorded in September 1995 at the Easley McCain Recording recording studio in Memphis, Tennessee.\\"Stuck\\" liner notes. Doug Easley, who founded and owned the studio, manned the production boards for the session.\\"Stuck\\" liner notes. Very shortly afterwards, the band began work on their first album, which they named Long Hair in Three Stages. They hired Jim O'Rourke to produce the album and it was recorded late 1995 at Solid Sound Studios in Hoffman Estates, Illinois,Long Hair in Three Stages liner notes. a studio much closer to the band's home than Easley McCain Recording. It was O'Rourke's first legitimate recording session with a rock band, and he would later go on, in Johnson's words, to become \\"an esteemed and highly sought after producer for many bands.\\" The band decided that the B-side of \\"Stuck\\", \\"When a Man Says \\"Ow!\\"\\", would reappear on the album. Musical style Long Hair in Three Stages has been characterized as a noise rock, experimental rock, math rock and post-rock album with strong similarities to no wave and post-punk. It is also considered to be a defining album of the \\"now wave\\" genre, a term that Skin Graft coined to refer to \\"a loose collective of angular-punk experimentalists based in Chicago\\" that carried on the legacy of no wave. Nitsuh Abebe of Allmusic said that the album combines \\"angular guitar attacks, odd skronks, jazzy tones, and a generally deconstructive approach to music into a sound of unparalleled idiosyncrasy,\\". One critic said that \\"the substance of the sound is definitely blues, chords, scales, as transfigured, denounce an almost obsessive attention to the respect of the canvas, albeit in a form decidedly postmodern.\\" Another critic said that \\"if one were to deconstruct their sound, each element would make absolutely no sense, yet together, a bizarrely rich (and thankfully bereft of the wackiness that plagues most 'weird' bands) whole emerges.\\" A defining characteristic of the album is the intertwining of Mark Shippy's \\"high\\" guitar work and Todd Ritman's \\"low\\" guitar work. Devin Friesen of Tiny Mix Tapes said that \\"the intertwined guitar lines sounded like hiccuping contortions, as if scraps of rock n‚Äô roll progressions were twisted, melted down, and remade into something else entirely. And even that‚Äôs too organized of an explanation, as whenever U.S. Maple would lock into a rhythmic groove, transition, or even a sustained melody, they would either take it somewhere else or abandon the idea completely.\\" Perfect Sound Forever magazine said that \\"generally Todd Rittmann's 'low' guitar provides a heavy bottom while Mark Shippy keeps his playing on the high end.\\" Peter Margasack of The Chicago Reader compared the music to Captain Beefheart's late 1960s work with the Magic Band, saying \\"the group‚Äôs complex, post Captain Beefheart rhythmic scheme upends standard grooves into a dizzying array of heaving stops and starts and polymetric irregularities, if there was ever a post-punk Trout Mask Replica, U.S. Maple‚Äôs debut is it.\\" Although Long Hair in Three Stages set the general consensus of US Maple as \\"deconstructionalists of rock and roll,\\" the band have since disavowed the notion that they were deliberately deconstructing anything, rather, according to guitarist Mark Shippy, just \\"constructing things differently.\\" Indeed, Perfect Sound Forever said the album \\"contained a few moments with recognizable beats\\" and that \\"compared to their following albums, Long Hair is unusually straightforward.\\" Regardless, Ondarock said the album \\"deepens the insights of the individual accentuating the vein and free improvisation of the band. Jim O'Rourke in the control room helps the four to give their best, scattering small found along the entire album, but to emerge strongly from the 10 tracks is the visionary talent of Maple.\\" Michael H Little of The Vinyl District said \\"each and every note of each and every song was constructed with a formalist‚Äôs care.\\" Composition \\"Hey King\\" starts with a \\"lopsided and limping rhythm, on which rantolano guitars and writhe, and then explode in all its force by dragging gait that stuns and disorients. Al Johnson howls unintelligible phonemes, while the agile and essential drumming of Samson is so determined to look for order and sense of rhythm in a mixture.\\" H Little said that the song begins with \\"a barrage of drums and Shippy‚Äôs high guitar, which sounds as if it's struggling to break into something recognizable as a song, but it stumbles and pratfalls like a Beckett clown until, and behold, he's playing a perfectly linear solo. Then Rittman comes in and a kind of moaning groove develops and Johnson commences vocalizing incoherently in that deranged hiss of his, letting out a cool ‚ÄúOoooo!‚Äù in the process. The song ends in a staggering groove, then stops abruptly.\\" \\"Letter to ZZ Top\\" is, as the name suggests, a tribute song written for hard rock/boogie rock band ZZ Top, which Abebe said \\"pretty much rules out any notion of normality\\" with lyrics like \\"Give my bones to Billy Gibbons.\\" The song contains unintelligible vocals, and, in the words of H Little, showcases Johnson \\"whispering like a mental patient confiding some great delusion and singing ‚ÄúGive my bones to Billy Gibbons, Ooooo!‚Äù and stuttering and repeating, ‚ÄúAnd you say‚Ä¶ you asshole‚Äù while the song picks up momentum and Shippy plays a bona fide solo. For once U.S. Maple doesn‚Äôt feel obligated to self-sabotage its own propulsion; I would go say far as to say ‚ÄúLetter to ZZ Top‚Äù is their equivalent of a commercial move, except the song has zero, and I mean zilch, commercial potential.\\" \\"Home Made Job\\" opens with Shippy's guitar \\"having an anxiety attack\\" while Rittman's plays a \\"very dissonant groove until the drums kick in and Johnson comes in moaning and begging in a deeper voice, like a street person on sterno importuning you for a dollar. And once again they actually keep the groove moving, Rittman throwing in bizarre guitar riffs and then shredding while Samson bashes away at the drums.\\" \\"Magic Job\\" features a \\"semi-solid\\" rhythm and the continuing \\"buzzing, strange progress\\" of the guitars. One reviewer commented that \\"State is Bad\\" \\"flat out rocks.\\" It opens with several stray piano notes and scratchy and ominously tentative guitar riffs, before \\"Rittman and the drums take off, Shippy firing off high- pitched riffs over their heads, until Johnson comes in and the song accelerates\\" in a way compared to Sonic Youth before alternating between stop- and-start and \\"that really fast groove,\\" and in the words of H Little, \\"then they really go wild, Shippy going at it like a maniac while Rittman lays down big riffs, before the song opens up, Johnson sings, ‚ÄúThe state was bad/And if I come back I‚Äôm dumb,‚Äù and the song closes in a caterwaul.\\" \\"Aplomado\\" is a \\"towering\\" and \\"sly\\" song featuring distorted drums and large riffs. \\"You Know What‚Ä¶ Will Get You You Know Where\\" opens with Rittman playing a heavy riff while Shippy plays a cool repetitive riff as Samson bashes away, whilst \\"When a Man Says ‚ÄúOw‚Äù\\" is a \\"strange and dissonant\\" song that is \\"almost blues\\" that towards its end morphs into a strange and choppy instrumental.\\" \\"Northwad\\" is said to anticipate \\"the sonic deconstruction process\\" that reached its summit on the band's following album Sang Phat Editor (1997). A \\"truly strange\\" song, it begins with \\"some odd flapping noise as Shippy plays riffs that sound exactly like a squealing pig. And the rhythm, such as it is, limps along to the sound of lots of distorted guitar punctuation until Johnson commences throwing out more unintelligible lines like verbal karate chops while the guitars fire off a dissonant riff here, a dissonant riff there, everywhere a dissonant riff riff. Then the song, which has never really been a song, breaks for a drum solo, then goes quiet before it gets louder and hobbles away into silence, but not without a happy-go-lucky little guitar figure at the end.\\" The concluding track, \\"Lady to Bing\\", is an instrumental said to recall Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica. Release Long Hair in Three Stages was released on October 24, 1995 by Skin Graft Records on CD and LP, with the LP edition containing a bonus track, \\"Found a Place to Have My Kittens.\\" A promotional version was also released on cassette. The band and Skin Graft Records' CEO, Mark Fischer, traveled to Fischer's father's metal manufacturing shop in St. Louis, Missouri to create the packaging of the LP edition. According to Fisher's design, \\"we would to turn raw material into album jackets. Large sheets of aluminum were sectioned, trimmed and cut to size by the five of us. The jackets were then punch-pressed and the edges dulled. The spine alone required three precise bends. Each jacket was then hand polished by everyone, leaving no two alike. More than fifty hours hard labor went into the making and design for the album jackets alone.\\" Due to the individually crafted sleeves, approximately 1,000 copies of the LP were made, and as such the LP edition became a rare, collector's item. All copies of the LP sold out within its first month of release. No singles were released from the album, but the band produced a music video for \\"State is Bad.\\" The album was remastered for re-release by Skin Graft Records on 21 June 2013. It was available as a CD, with all artwork printed using three classy metallic pantone inks, and a LP in three variations: two metal sleeved limited edition LP variants and a standard issue version, marking the first time it was released on LP in a standard \\"printed\\" issue. The same sheet metal shop was used to fabricate the metal sleeve variations, which were different and immediately discernible from the original 1995 LP copies. The metal sleeved editions will also include a metallic pantone printed lyric card inside the jacket, and unlike the original run of sleeves which were crimped and folded on the right side, they were crimped at the bottom. Each of the metal sleeve editions was hand polished differently, featuring the band name embossed into the metal on the front and an individual control number embossed on the back, so that no two will be alike. It was originally intended for release in May 2013, but it was not ready by \\"press time\\" as the original metal stamper broke at the pressing plant, which forced Skin Graft to go back to the lacquer stage. Rittmann made use of the extra time to remaster the bonus track, \\"Found a Place to Have My Kittens.\\" Critical reception Long Hair in Three Stages was released to very positive reviews from music critics. Alternative Press said the album \\"reaffirms an ideal: that there's still more to be done with electric guitars.\\" German magazine Musikexpress rated the album a score of five out of seven. Peter Margasask of The Chicago Reader called the album \\"a stunning debut\\" which proves \\"that noise can be more than just a racket.\\" Skin Graft Records themselves acknowledged the critical acclaim on their website. The band soon found themselves flying Coach to Deutschland for a European tour. The extensive six-week tour spanned twelve countries and included a Peel Session for John Peel's BBC Radio show. It was followed by the release of \\"The Wanderer\\" non-album single in 1996. Retrospective reception to the album has been similarly favorable. Todd Lamb of SF Weekly called it a \\"noisy classic.\\" Nick Hutchings of The Quietus commented that the album was \\"difficult yet rewarding.\\" Scott McGaughey of Perfect Sound Forever said that \\"the best moments occur when the two guitars meet and then quickly fall back into their individual spaces. Maple began racking up Captain Beefheart comparisons, but simply calling them \\"Beefheart-ish\\" doesn't do their sound justice. U.S. Maple's music is even more vicious and frightening than Beefheart's.\\" Spin said the album \\"defined their chaotic vibe.\\" Nitsuh Abebe of Allmusic rated the album four stars out of five and said it is \\"nothing short of stunning,\\" and commented that \\"the record's finest moments come when the slanted attack and fractured composition converge to simulate something approaching a conventional song,\\" highlighting \\"Letter to ZZ Top\\" as an example and concluding that \\"between these off-kilter constructions and the group's even more off-kilter deconstructions, a truly amazing record is created, one that combines hard-edged, \\"whiskey, no chaser\\" rock with exceptionally intelligent slants and fractures. Michael H Little of The Vinyl District grade the album \\"A\\" and, after an analysis of each song, concluded in his review that \\"You owe it to yourself and your unborn children to listen to and ardently loathe U.S. Maple, only (if you‚Äôre as obstinate as I am) to grow to love them, because they made sounds the human ear would never have heard otherwise. It is my most ardent belief that nothing succeeds like a grand failure‚Äîwho would remember the Titanic if it hadn‚Äôt sunk? U.S. Maple knew this right down to its contrarian bones. Far better a band that fails on its own terms than one that succeeds on somebody else‚Äôs. Especially if that failure sounds as fresh and obstinately alive as U.S. Maple's.\\" Ondarock commented that \\"the logic pursued by Maple is not far from that developed\\" from Sonic Youth's earliest music, \\"adventurous music and \\"avant\\" in substance, but covered with rock moods,\\" saying that U.S. Maple show the no wave genre reaching \\"its highest expression. The decadent and morbid sound of Sonic Youth is subjected to a further process of fragmentation, even the last remnants of meaning present in the music of New Yorkers are finally swept away in favor of a pataphysic mood and lacking any referent.\\" They referred to the album as a \\"masterpiece.\\" Monica Kendrick of The Chicago Reader said that the album \\"was a gauntlet thrown down at the feet of that entire scene, and U.S. Maple never topped it.\\" Music writer Eddy Silia rated the album four stars out of five in his 2000 book Post rock e oltre. Introduzione alle musiche del 2000 (Post-Rock: Introduction to the Music of 2000). Legacy In 1999, Alternative Press ranked the album at number 85 in its list of \\"The 90 Greatest Albums of the 90s,\\"http://ww.rocklistmusic.co.uk/apress.html the only album by U.S. Maple included in the list. In 2014, music journalist Andrew Earles included the album in his book Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981‚Äì1996, saying that \\"goes damn far towards deconstructing [rock and roll] down to nothing, and then rebuilding it into something with all the parts in the wrong places but miraculously maintaining its idiosyncratic self- made style as a form of underground and experimental rock.\\" In 2014, About Entertainment ranked the album at number 4 in their list of the \\"Top 10 Math- Rock Albums,\\" saying the album \\"arrived right when math rock was starting to develop its identity. The LP was generally received as a noisy, chaotic mess, but listening to songs like \\"Magic Job\\" ‚Äîwhose guitars sound like a swarm of hornets‚Äî reveals a band that, in their Beefheartian way, were so well-drilled every seeming accident was precisely timed.\\" Musician E. Ryan Goodmann commented in an interview that \\"when I first heard Shorty's Fresh Breath and U.S. Maple's Long Hair in Three Stages, I said to myself, 'now this is new music!' They furthered my curiosity and excitement all the way up to Acre Thrills. Ever since they broke up I have found nothing to take their place.\\" Former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins played \\"When a Man Says 'Ow'\\" on his KRCW radio show in 2011.

The title was established on February 3, 1996 by NWA Jersey, in which The Lost Boys (Yar and Wolf) won a Triangle tag team match against The Greek Connection (Gus the Greek and Jimmy Londos) and Bad Attitude (Seek and Destroy). This title is one of at least five championships that share the same name under the NWA's supervision. On April 7, 2000, the final champions The Pitbulls (#1 and #2) lost the titles to Chris Candido and Tommy Cairo; however, the NWA reversed the decision and instead of returning the titles to The Pitbulls, the promotion retired the championship for unknown reasons. Overall, there have been 17 reigns that have occurred in the United States. From the information known, The Misfits (Derek Domino and Harley Lewis)' fourth reign was the longest in the title's history, at 204 days; their and Downward Spiral (Adrian Hall and Twiggy Ramirez)'s first reigns, respectively, were the shortest, at 21 days.

Family influences His parents were Francis (Frank) and Gwendolyn Webb, who also had two daughters, Nancy, the older, and Elizabeth, the younger. From his mother's side of the family Webb drew a strong Wesleyan Methodist background. This contributed a major social justice streak to Webb's origins and to his lifelong views on politics and society. From his mother and aunt he gained a love of language, enquiry and learning; and from his father extraordinary social and organisational skills. From 1929 to 1951 Webb lived at Kinkora Road, Hawthorn and attended the Auburn Methodist Church. From 1935 til 1942 he was a student at Spring Road Primary and Central Schools in Malvern. From 1943 to 1946 Webb was a high school student at Melbourne Boys' High School. Activism By 1946 Webb was organiser of the Save Europe Now Campaign. In 1947 he completed a term at Melbourne University, and also took part in Methodist Youth Department Camps. In 1948 he became involved with the United Nations Appeal for Children and the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, although he was also working as a paint salesman from 1947 through 1950. Webb studied accountancy at the Hemmingway Robertson Institute in 1949, and in 1950, while leaving on a trip to Calcutta and Oberammergau, he learned he had won a United Nations International Essay contest, entitling him to a fellowship to represent Australia at the yearly assemblies of the World Federation of United Nations Associations in Geneva and to study at the UN general assembly in New York. He and met international leaders including Eleanor Roosevelt. This experience changed his world view, including his faith. Webb continued his studies at Melbourne University (graduating with honors) and Queens College from 1951 until 1954. Meanwhile, he became secretary, then president, of the Melbourne University Student Representative Council. It was in 1952 that he received a UNESCO Grant to travel for three months studying aid and development in Asia. From 1953 to 1969 he was Honorary Secretary to the Volunteer Graduate Association for Indonesia, forerunner of the Overseas Service Bureau, now Australian Volunteers International. During 1954 Webb was a member of the Board of Union Theatre Company, International Vice‚ÄìPresident of the National Union of Students, and president of the Sports & Social Club at Queens College. A tutor in Political Science at Melbourne University from 1955‚Äì56, Webb helped establish the Australia-Indonesia Association and was chairman for the Australian Committee for the World University Service. While Warden of Union House at Melbourne University (1956‚Äì63), Webb and his family lived on campus in Tin Alley. In 1957 Webb was foundation committee member of the information group 'Aboriginal Affairs'. From 1958 to 1969 he was a national committee member for Community Aid Abroad. In 1959 and 1960 Webb travelled to Europe and the US researching student unions and housing for Melbourne and Monash Universities, and during the latter year he founded the Overseas Service Bureau (now Australian Volunteers International) to encourage and support Australian international volunteers. (Webb was to become the full-time director of the Overseas Service Bureau from 1963 until 1969). In 1965 he was involved in establishing the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, now Australian Council for International Development, the Australian non‚Äìgovernment aid sector‚Äôs peak body. After leaving the Overseas Service Bureau, Webb was director of the Social and Cultural Division, Asian and Pacific Council (ASPAC) Cultural and Social Centre for the Asia and Pacific Region, Seoul, until 1970, the same year he was awarded his Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to International Affairs. From 1970 to 1975 he was director of Community Aid Abroad (now Oxfam Australia). In 1972 he published Towards Survival: A programme for Australia‚Äôs overseas aid. In 1975 Webb initiated Citizens for Democracy during the 1975 Australian election campaign. Personal life Webb wed Lesley Merele Hayes in 1956, which union lasted until 1979. In 1958 his first child, Richard James Bawtree Webb was born. By 1960 another son, Geoffrey Ian, arrived. Catherine Dilys, the first daughter, was born in 1964. Webb helped Merele to establish Nillumbik Bushscape (a landscaping business) in 1976, and she still runs it. That same year, Webb was hospitalised, as he suffered a long period of serious depression culminating in hospitalisation for bipolar disorder. This undermined his self‚Äìconfidence, and he largely withdrew from public life from then on. Even so, he was manager for the Nursing Mothers Association from 1977 to 1978. In 1984 Webb married Marie Scott, and the next year he was a consultant for the Australian Schizophrenia Association. In the 1990s he was chair, then member of the Corinella Park Committee. But in 1997, Webb was hospitalised with acute goitre, and spent 10 days in intensive care, the start of twelve years of debilitating ill‚Äìhealth. Despite this, in 2009 he celebrated his 80th Birthday and 25th Wedding anniversary, and on 20 July 2009, Webb died peacefully in his sleep. The beneficiaries of volunteerism Webb always maintained that the volunteers who went to Asia, Africa and the Pacific contributed far more to Australian society than they did to their host countries.

She was the eldest of three children, followed by her sister Erzs√©bet and six month old brother G√°bor. Ban herself was only twenty when she was sectioned off in a ghetto with other Jews. During Operation Margarethe, the German invasion and occupation of Hungary, Samu was sent to a labor camp while she, Erzs√©bet, G√°bor, Juliska, her grandmother Nina, and eleven other relatives were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, arriving on July 1, 1944. All of Ban's family members in Auschwitz were killed, but Ban herself was transferred by Dr. Josef Mengele to the Buchenwald concentration camp to work in a bomb factory, where she intentionally constructed faulty bombs. On April 15, 1945, the campmates of Buchenwald were forced to march to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. On the way, Ban and eleven of her campmates escaped and were discovered by the U.S. Army, who had just liberated the Bergen-Belsen camp. Ban returned to Budapest, Hungary, in September 1945, where she reunited with her father, Samu (who later changed his surname to G√°bor in honor of his deceased son). That October she married a Budapester teacher, Ern≈ë B√°n (later Earnest Ban).

On the evening of 24 November, after the battle was lost, he performed seppuku (ritual suicide) in the tradition of Japanese samurai warriors. He was posthumously promoted to lieutenant general. Early life and education Nakagawa was a native of Kumamoto Prefecture, and was the third son of an elementary school principal. He graduated from the 30th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in December 1918 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry of the IJA 48th Regiment. Career He subsequently served with the 2nd Regiment of the Taiwan Army of Japan, with the HQ of the IJA 12th Division, and as a battalion commander with the IJA 79th Infantry Regiment. He experienced combat for the first time during the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and subsequently served with distinction during the Second Sino-Japanese War in Shanxi Province. In March 1939, he was sent to the Army Staff College at the recommendation of his regimental commander, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1939. In April 1941, he was awarded the prestigious Order of the Golden Kite, 4th class. In March 1943, Nakagawa was promoted to colonel and was made commander of the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment, which was under the command of the IJA 14th Division in Manchukuo. As the situation in the Pacific War increasingly deteriorated for Japan, the 14th Division was redeployed to bolster the defenses of the Japanese territory of Palau, and the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment was assigned to the small island of Peleliu south of the main islands in the archipelago. When he left Japan, Nakagawa told his wife that he would not be coming back. Nakagawa made use of the natural geography of the island to construct numerous fortifications connected by a tunnel system, in order to defend the island in depth, and to inflict the most possible casualties on the invading forces. On 15 September 1944, US forces landed on Peleliu and the battle lasted over two months. In the United States, it was a controversial battle because of the island's questionable strategic value and the high casualty rate, which was the highest for U.S. military personnel of any battle in the Pacific War.

Drums are an important part of the dances.Lopit Community in Torit Celebrates Cultural Heritage - Peter Lokale Nakimangole, 8 February 2012 Some main dances are: * BuraGr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern pp. 146‚Äì147  When someone passes away, the dancing happens for 24 hours, beginning with the women. * IkangaSudanese harvest celebrations fill Menzies Hall , 2011-01-06 - Dandenong Leader  A dance performed at the end of the harvest. * Rongit - A celebratory dance performed on different occasions, by the ruling age set and the upcoming ruling age set. This is also part of a training process for the upcoming group. * Hitobok - Performed when preparing for a war or fighting. * The Miliang and Hatar - A celebratory dance performed when a lady has been betrothed from a different clan to a given clan, performed mainly at night till morning. * LamGr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern pp. 75‚Äì76  Performed once a year around May, after a hunt that begins and night-time and ends the next morning. The hunt itself is a race between individual hunters, all of the kill is presented to the king. *Liang - this is an afternoon dance between noon‚Äì1:00 pm before evening section dance. It varies between old and young deceased persons. for example, when a young person 20‚Äì30-years-old dies, people went hunting far from the village between 3‚Äì4:00 am and returned home 12 noon before Liang in mourning of the late person. Many things, e.g. animal meat, will be given to the home of the late to support the family and the visitors as well as a respect. *Lotuhe - this is a dance performed only for an older person 50 and older and it takes place a night before (Bura) normally about 6 pm ‚Äì 12 am depending on the season or the conditions of that certain villages. e.g. enough food, everyone is happy and any major sicknesses. *Malia - this is a dance performed for young person ages between 18‚Äì35 or less than 50 years of age for all genders. malia take place between 6-12am. one drum is use only. *ikitia (iitiyang)- this is a dance performs in afternoon about 2‚Äì3:00 pm just after Liang and is performed only by women.  Social structure = Ruling age set = The monyomiji are the authorities and representatives of each village, and the most powerful people in the village. They make the important decisions about war, festivals, cultivation, and initiations.Simonse, Kings of Disaster p. 71-74Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 141-143 They are respected and obeyed, but are obliged to serve the community and previous generation of monyomiji. If they are seen to be making bad decisions or not following the rules, then this older generation of monyomiji may suspend them. A great ceremony is held when the new generation of monyomiji takes over from the previous ruling age set. This transfer of power happens at regular intervals, ranging from 12‚Äì22 years depending on the location,Simonse, Kings of Disaster p. 71 unless there are exceptional circumstances.Changing the Guard Skye Wheeler, 2012, IPS News. When this happens, they are sometimes sent away from the village and expected to return with a valuable item to express their apology. In central and Northern Lopit (Ngotira, Dorik, Ngabori), a new set of monyomiji is initiated every 12 years. There are two names which are alternatively used for this group: ngalam and lefirat. In Southern Lopit, (Lomiaha, Lohutok, Lolongo, and 1 village from Ngotira), a new set of monyomiji is initiated every 22 years. The same name is used for each new set: hifira.Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 141 = Girlhood = From the age of 10‚Äì11, young girls begin preparing for initiation into girlhood. They begin to form associations amongst themselves, numbering from 3 up to 10‚Äì15. The groups of girls need to find a sleeping space to share in the house of an older woman. This older woman may be one of the girls' grandmothers, or a woman that is approached by a pair from the group who seek permission to stay in her house.Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 132 This time is for the girls to gain experience and knowledge of their expected duties as hodwo (adolescent girls). Each day they get up early (around 4am) to start grinding sorghum and other grains for their families.Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 52 The old woman becomes a mentor to the girls, sharing advice with them in the mornings, as well as stories at night. The formal initiation into hodwo takes place around the age of 14. An individual girl might be selected by the monyomiji for initiation, or a whole group might be initiated at the same time as the initiation of the new ruling age set (monyomiji). Girls' duties as hodwo include:Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 134 * Being present when the monyomiji are dancing. (being absent for this occasion is severely punishedGr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern pp. 134‚Äì135) * Clearing sticks and weeds from the monyomiji farm. (mana na gula / mana na habu) * For new farms, clearing the land. * Providing water to the monyomiji who work the farm. * Preparing hanyima (peanut butter) in a calabash for the Ikanga festival, as well as an edible oil made from a native fruit. * Run errands for the monyomiji together with the dure horwong / inyarhalu (young boys), such as collecting bamboo from the mountain (nyarat), particularly in Omiaha. = Womanhood = Girls usually remain hodwo until they are married and have children. At this stage, they become honyomiji (women).Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern pp. 132‚Äì133 Unmarried women may choose to join this group, or remain a hodwo for two more years. Once girls have joined the honyomiji, they are the youngest set of women. It will be 30 years before they are initiated to the next set.  Produce and economy  The Lopit live in a hilly and fertile environment and are agro-pastoralists, practising traditional agriculture as well as livestock rearing. These socio-economic occupations are carried out both on the mountain slopes and in the plains. The main crops are sorghum, bulrush, millet, pumpkin, ground nuts, simsim, okra, syam, cassava, sweet potato, maize and mango.Eastern Equatoria State Food Security and Livelihoods Bulletin, Volume 2, April‚ÄìAugust 2008Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 44-46 They also harvest forest products, bamboo roots, coconuts, honey, shea nuts (pressed to make oil), figs, and many other sorts.Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 47 = Hunting = The Lopit, like other groups in the area, practise extensive hunting. They hunt during the dry season, after the harvest (January ‚Äì April) has ended. This time is for group hunting, when groups of up to 2,000 men team up to hunt game. Neighbouring villages team up to hunt in the land of the village that has called for the hunt.Simonse, Kings of Disaster p. 66‚Äì67 The call is put out four weeks in advance. The groups split into two parts that proceed in different directions, and then the heads come together and regroup to cover a large area. The first animal killed in the hunt is given to the king of the land. When the meat is being divided up, elderly people have the first choice.Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 75‚Äì79 Some parts of the animal cannot be eaten freely. The internal organs (except for the lungs) can only be eaten by the older men and women, whilst young people cannot eat any part of the head or lower legs of an animal. Buffalo, elephant, giraffe, rhinoceros, gazelle, ostrich and antelope are usually hunted. Special hunts are organised for lions and leopards if they have killed livestock.Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 181 Fishing is practised from August to April, in swampy areas and lakes.Gr√ºb, The Lotuho of the Southern p. 74 =Sub-communities of Lopit= *Omiaha *Ohutok *Olongo *Dorik *Ngaboli *Ngotira  Notes  References  * Franz Steiner Verlag Stuttgart Lulu Press, Inc.

The center was founded in 2001 by Ericka Kaplan, Jean Uelmen, and Teresa Qui√±onez and now serves over 1,000 members of the Due√±as community. Mission Facade of Open Windows To provide education and community development opportunities for children and families in Guatemala. History The library room with over 15,000 books. The Foundation first opened in 2001 with an enrollment of 20 children assembling in a small room. The original 300 books for the center were donated from a library project that had recently closed in Rio Dulce, Guatemala. The Foundation‚Äôs primary function was to act as a dynamic library with the aim of getting kids to read for pleasure. Over the years, Open Windows has continued to accumulate students, books, funds, and other resources through the personal networking of the founders and the community. In 2003, Rotary International donated 10 computers to Open Windows. This donation allowed Open Windows to expand its services by offering computer classes and by allowing students to use computers for homework. Open Windows also launched its initial website in 2003 which allowed for greater publicity. In September 2005, a formal library room was built and is now filled with over 12,000 books including picture, fiction, non-fiction, and reference books. Two years later 2007, an impending donation from Rotary International for an additional 10 computers prompted the building of a second story computer center at Open Windows. The center was completed in April, 2007. By this time, the mission had been expanded to include enhancing technology skills and to provide educational programming and tutoring for students. Programs Open Windows currently provides multiple programs: the after school program, the activities program, the computer center, a scholarship program, a pre-school introduction to learning, installation of eco-stoves and house construction. =After School Program= The after school program allows the students time to finish their homework with the supervision and assistance of the seven teachers at Open Windows Foundation. Because of the close relationship between Open Windows and the local schools, homework for the students is often designed with the specific resources of Open Windows in mind. =Activities Program= Activities Program The activities program is designed for the students to participate in an interactive reading and learning activity as a group. Every afternoon the teachers at Open Windows Foundation use a book read aloud to ground an activity designed to emphasize reading, writing, creative, listening, and thinking skills. =Computer Center= The computer center was completed in 2007 and is composed of 20 computers donated from Rotary International. Classes are provided for children and adults and for various computer programs. In addition to the classes, 10 of the computers are now equipped with internet access for research and other educational purposes. The computer center is always in high demand as it provides the only public-access computers in the area. =Scholarship Program= Thanks to donations from Tom Sullivan, a scholarship program was set up in 2003 to enable motivated students from low-income families to go to high school. Most students in San Miguel Due√±as can not afford to attend high school because they do not have the money to pay for the tuition, books, and uniform costs. Unfortunately in Guatemala the government does not pay these costs. The scholarship program had three students in its first year, but Open Windows has since sponsored more than 400 scholarships. This year there are 30 scholarship students. The chosen, talented students are given funds to cover the costs of uniforms, books, and transportation. In return, they are asked to keep Open Windows informed of their progress. We find that high school graduates, in turn, help their brothers and sisters attend school. Open Windows also helps graduates in preparing for new job interviews, which includes writing a Curriculum Vitae. We hope to place these students in the local job market. In return, Open Windows scholarship students or family members take turns cleaning the library early each morning. In 2011, we started the community service program. During vacation the scholarship students come to the learning center to help small groups of primary children with math and reading skills. This, in turn, helps them learn to teach, work with others and speak in front of a group. Only $500 sends a scholarship recipient to high school for one year. =Pre-school Introduction to Learning= A more recent program involves five and six year- old children who are not enrolled in school but who started coming to the center wanting to learn. Open Windows' teachers began giving them basic instruction in reading and simple arithmetic and in time the number of youngsters attending grew. When the children participate in this program, the parents agree to send the children to school the following year. =Eco- stoves= Many Guatemalan families cook their meals on open fires insides their houses. This fills the houses with smoke and requires the families to spend a lot of time or a lot of money obtaining firewood. Eco-stoves reduce the wood required for cooking by about two-thirds and they send the smoke out of the house through a chimney. Open Windows, in alliance with the Canadian organization Developing World Connections, installs new eco-stoves in homes all around San Miguel Due√±as, saving families money and health problems. =House Construction= Again in collaboration with Developing World Connections, Open Windows builds houses for families in the area. While many families live in homes made of sheet metal with a dirt floor, these new houses are made of concrete blocks and have cement floors, which allow the families to keep them much cleaner. Volunteers work with masons hired by Open Windows to construct one-, two- or three-room houses, which represent a major improvement in the lives of the families.
