Having come from a religious background, he was very much interested in philosophical, religious, and social matters right from his childhood. After he left Sorbonne where he was a student, he completed his studies in various parts of the world, such as Rome, Geneva, Salamanca, and Montreal. Having travelled widely and being a devout believer to be in close contact with truth and reality, he was thus able to compare what he learned with what he saw physically.

Cohen, Paris was \\"the author of several rabidly anti-Catholic works.\\" Cohen also observes that Paris is described on the jacket of Genocide in Satellite Croatia, 1941–1945 (1961) as \\"a French historian from a Catholic family\\". L. E. Lee, writing about Genocide in Satellite Croatia,Loyd E. Lee: World War II in Asia and the Pacific and the War's Aftermath, with General Themes: A Handbook of Literature and Research, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998 p. 369 described the work as a frightening documentation of the Ustaše. The journalist Richard West noted that Paris was one of a group of \\"anti-Catholic polemicists\\" who used events in the Independent State of Croatia to attack the Catholic Church as a whole. West observes that Genocide in Satellite Croatia, 1941–1945 was first published in French, and later in English. It was subsequently reprinted by a Protestant publisher in the United States as Convert or Die..., with a \\"blood- red cover showing a man kneeling at gunpoint in front of a priest\\". Despite this horrific imagery, West opines that Paris' book is based on careful research, much of it from Magnum Crimen.

Plot  Shekar (Prabhu) becomes mentally ill after his girlfriend Anita (Lissy) dies because of an electric short circuiting accident during a rock concert. He is admitted into an institution managed by Nagaraj (Senthamarai). With the help of a young doctor Geetha (Saranya Ponvannan), who is Nagaraj's daughter, and an old friend Raja (Sarath Babu), Shekar slowly regains his memory and mental equilibrium. He and Geetha soon fall in love. But Nagaraj has already arranged Geetha's marriage with someone else, so he opposes the lovers. When Nagaraj finds that Geetha and Shekar are adamant, he performs a surgery (lobotomy) on Shekar that puts him into a state of coma. Raja feels that death would be preferable to vegetative life and kills Shekar. He confronts Nagaraj, confesses to the euthanasia and tries to kill him for ruining Shekar's life, but Geetha suddenly kills her father before Raja can.

In his career, Devereux also designed a theatre, a synagogue, a Masonic hall (he became a Mason to do it, though he was Catholic), and Catholic, African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church , and Lutheran churches. One of the latter was the tallest building in South Carolina for over a hundred years. He blended and mixed architectural influences and styles. Early life and family J. H. D. Devereux, ca 1902 son of John Henry Devereux Devereux was born on 26 July 1840 into a Catholic family in County Wexford, Ireland. His parents were Nicholas and Dorothy Delorey (as they were recorded in the United States.) In 1843, when he was three years old, his family immigrated to the United States. They settled in Charleston, South Carolina.\\"S.C. Birthday,\\" Charleston News and Courier 26 July 1947.

In the 1860 census, all three sons were still living at home: James, 22, Devereux, 20, and Nicholas, Jr., 16. In 1863 Devereux married Agatha Eulalie Brandt, an immigrant from France.

Career An immigrant from Ireland as a young child, Devereux grew up in Charleston. He started work as a plasterer. After studying architecture under Edward C. Jones, a well-known Charleston architect and builder, Devereux became a noted architect of South Carolina's Lowcountry public buildings and churches. He designed and built St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church in the period 1867–1872. As a bonus, the church gave him a sterling silver tea set. At 255 feet, St. Matthews was the tallest building in South Carolina until 1973. Much of Devereux's work in Charleston is proximate to the corner of Meeting and Broad streets, an area locally known as the \\"Four Corners of Law.\\" The federal post office and courthouse, which he designed, exemplifies the importance of federal influence. Church and local government are additional components of the metaphor. During British colonial rule, the future US courthouse site was the location of the gallows for public executions. In 1885, Devereux was appointed as Superintendent of Construction and Repairs of the U.S. Treasury Department, which handled public buildings. While in that position, he designed the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Charleston. His choice of Second Renaissance Revival architecture expressed the nobility popularly \\"associated with public architecture\\" during that epoch. Congress authorized funds in 1887 for construction of the Post Office and Courthouse building. Devereux, as the architect, started the design in 1890 and finished construction of the building in 1896. The building was a lengthy project, completed in 1896 and costing $500,000. Military During the American Civil War, Devereux was commissioned as a captain in the Confederate Army in 1864; he was taken prisoner on 25 February 1865. He was imprisoned in Fortress Monroe, Virginia in Casement no. 6. He was paroled 10 May 1865, a month after General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. Death According to his death certificate, \\"Colonel\\" Devereux died from general arteriosclerosis with a contributing preexisting factor of \\"paralysis from Cerebral hemorrhage\\". He was buried in Devereux Chapel in Charleston's Saint Lawrence Cemetery. This building was razed. A large sarcophagus with Devereux's name stands at the former site of the chapel.  Selected architectural works  post office lobby The National Park Service has recognized Devereux as Charleston's \\"most prolific architect of the post-Civil War era.\\" A partial listing follows:  Charleston, South Carolina – United States Post Office and Courthouse  This Charleston building was completed by Devereux in 1896. The building was individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and is also within the boundaries of the National Register and National Historic Landmark Charleston Historic District. Today, the building continues to operate as a post office and courthouse. Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church Devereux designed the large, Gothic church for its black congregation; it was erected starting in spring 1891 and completed in 1892. The AME Church was the first independent black congregation in the United States, founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After the Civil War, its missionaries planted many new congregations in the South, including in Charleston. St Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church St Matthews Responding to the needs of a growing ethnic German community after a new wave of immigration following the 1848 revolutions, the German Lutherans purchased land on King Street on which to build a new church in 1867–72. They selected Devereux as the architect.Poston, Jonathan H. p. 386. Devereux chose a Gothic Revival design. The original facade was stucco, scored to resemble stonework and painted in different colors, using paint that was mixed with sand, simulating the look of stonework using different colors of stone. This \\"polychrome\\" effect reflected a motif for church architecture popularized at the time in The Stones of Venice by John Ruskin. As originally conceived, the black and white Ablaq facade was striking, although it has since been covered over. The church's steeple is the tallest in South Carolina, and for 101 years (until 1973) the church was the state's tallest building. Its height was not surpassed until 1973, when the Tower at 1301 Gervais was built. In the cyclone of 1885, the steeple fell. Its wrought iron spiral and finial built by Christopher Werner was destroyed, and not replaced due to cost. A fire in 1965 caused the steeple to topple; it fell to the ground, impaling the spire eighteen feet deep, where it remains embedded to this day. The church's stained glass was not affected. The church was restored after the fire. Stella Maris Stella Maris Church Devereux designed the Stella Maris Church and supervised its construction on Sullivan's Island in Charleston.Charleston Irish 20 South Battery (aka the Stevens-Lathers House or Battery Carriage House Inn) Lathers House This house was originally built in 1843 for Samuel S. Stevens. Devereux was hired after the Civil War by its next owner, Colonel Richard Lathers, a Southerner who fought for the Union Army. He wanted the house at 20 South Battery to be remodeled in the popular Second Empire style. Devereux also added a library, with a mansard roof. He constructed a \\"ballroom\\", which Lathers used as a conference room, for meetings with his wealthy Yankee connections. His associations were unpopular and the townspeople forced him out of Charleston. According to the current owner, who operates the house as a bed and breakfast: \\"Charlestonians eventually told Lathers he was unwelcome so he took his Yankee blood money with him and left.\\" Lathers used his conference room to meet with such notables as New York Governor and Presidential Candidates John H. Seymour and William Cullen Bryant, seeking sectional reconciliation. \\"[A]fter attempting for four years to restore good will between men of the North and the South, Lathers sold the house and returned to New York.\\"Poston, Jonathan H., p. 269 In New York, Lathers was a patron of architect Alexander Jackson Davis, who created \\"Lathers' Hill\\" and associated gothic cottages for him. Charleston Female Seminary  24 South Battery c.1790?  The western half of this 18th-century double tenement (the eastern half was demolished) was remodeled in 1870 for George S. Cook, the noted photographer he has been called \\"the Southern Mathew Brady\\". Devereux was the architect. 225–227 King St. Academy of Music/Riviera Theatre In 1830 on this site was Kerrison's Department Store (see List of defunct department stores of the United States), which was reputed to be \\"the South's oldest department store still in operation.\\" When the store was destroyed in the great fire of 1838, it was rebuilt by Kerrison. In 1852 it was purchased by Browning & Leman, dry goods merchants, and a new store was designed by Charleston architect Edward C. Jones. In 1869, architect John Henry Devereux remodeled the building, which became known as the Academy of Music. The theatre opened on 1 December 1869 with a 1200-seat capacity, and it would often have sold-out houses. The acoustics were first rate. It had a \\"Sun burner\\" gas-light chandelier illumination system, set in a faux \\"starlit sky\\" ceiling, and a proscenium arch \\"supported by gilded columns and moldings.\\" For seven decades it was \\"one of America's best known theatres . . . patterned after European opera houses\\" with excellent acoustics. Performers included Oscar Wilde, Sarah Bernhardt, Fanny Brice, Billie Burke, Eddie Foy, Lily Langtry, Lillian Russell, John Philip Sousa and his band, the Ziegfeld Follies and others of similar international acclaim. Important movies opened there. The building's aura faded, and it was demolished and replaced by a new building.Ravenel, Beatrice St. Julien. p. 211, 266Do You Know Your Charleston. The Post and Courier 22 July 1935. In 1939 the Academy of Music was replaced by an Art Deco building called the Riviera Theatre.Other notable Art Deco Buildings in Charleston include: Martschink Building, 26 Cumberland St.; Kress Building 281 King St. ca.1931 See Smith, Ricardo, Riviera Poster, infra.

Although the Italianate facade was remodeled early in the 20th century, its architectural integrity remains. In order, it housed a dry goods merchant, J.R. Read & Co., and then a studio and residence of George Bernard.Stockton, Robert P. The Post and Courier \\"Do you know your Charleston\\". 14 June 1982. 270 King Street Masonic Temple In order to undertake this contract to build a Masonic Temple and defuse any criticism that it was designed by someone not a Mason, Devereux, who was a Roman Catholic, took the Entered Apprentice Degree of Masonry. He fashioned his design in the Tudor Gothic style, and it was constructed of brick and stucco. Though remodeled several times, its original 1872 beauty persists to a degree.Stockton, Robert P. The Post and Courier \\"Do you know your Charleston\\". 24 May 1982Ravenel, Beatrice St. Julien. p. 266 In a 1984 renovation, the \\"Gothic-arched storefronts were restored.\\"Poston, Jonathan H., p. 370. See pic at Flickr. 134 Broad Street John Klinck House Designed for wealthy Charleston grocery store owner John Klinch, the house was constructed in 1872. It is a combination of Gothic Revival and Italianate stylings, an upright-and- wing structure with a prominent two story porch across the wing.Poston, Jonathan H., p. 297. 152 Broad St. c.1885 John Henry Devereux was the architect for William M. Bird, who was a partner with H.F. Welch. Their company was William M.

Architectural detail mimicks features on the house at 24 South Battery. \\"Similarities include the prominent two tiered bay window, window treatment, piazza collonettes and railings, and other decorations. The house is faced with novelty siding typical of the period and the foundation is of Stoney Landing brick, made locally in the 1880s.\\"Stockton, Robert P.

Burroughs novel The Soft Machine. Early years Siiiii was formed in the 1983 when singer Paul Devine answered an ad in Melody Maker to join Mark (guitar) and Angie Holmes (bass) of Sheffield bands Fatales and Surface Mutants as well as Wayne Furniss, drummer and guitarist for Pulp. Siiiii quickly became known in the UK goth scene, gigging with influential bands such as Skeletal Family, The March Violets, Inca Babies, and The Chameleons. During this time, Siiiii attracted the attention of Mick Mercer, who was then editor of ZigZag. Mercer wrote favorably of the band and documented them in photographs, which would later appear in his book \\"Gothic Rock Black Book\\". Siiiii recorded several tracks and gained favorable reviews for their performances, however, they were unable to attract a label and disbanded in 1986. Mark Holmes went on to perform and record with The Anti-Group. 2005–present In 2005, the band regrouped to compile Ancient, an archival release of demos recorded during the band's initial period of activity. This compilation was released originally on their own King Sol Records label. Following the release of Ancient, Siiiii played the last ever Drop Dead Festival in New York, then followed up with a number of European shows. A live album, Ein Verdammtes Versprechen, was recorded in Germany in 2008 and given a limited release on the band's King Sol Records. In 2014, Siiiii released Modern, a studio album of new material, recorded in Manchester, Sheffield and Glastonbury.

It took its name from the nearby Jacobs's Well, which may have been a mikveh, a type of Jewish ritual bath. The theatre was built by actor John Hippisley, who had created the character of Peachum in the premiere of John Gay's Beggar's Opera.Powell, p. 12 The stage space was so small that actors exiting on one side had to walk around the building to re-enter on the other side, often being subject to banter by spectators enjoying this free show.Powell, p. 13 A hole was knocked through a party wall to an adjacent ale house, The Malt Shovel, so that actors, and audience seated on the stage, could obtain refreshments.Latimer, pp. 63–64 Admission prices ranged from 1 shilling to 3 shillings, and it was estimated that a full house could earn as much as £80. Servants of patrons were admitted free of charge to an upper gallery.Powell, pp. 12–13 In later years, Thomas Chatterton described the theatre as a \\"hut\\". Powell, p. 19 The journey to the theatre from fashionable areas such as Queen Square and College Green was somewhat perilous, especially on dark nights, and consequently the theatre often provided linkboys to light the way with torches.Watts, p. 44 Notable actors who appeared at the theatre included Charles Macklin, William Powell, and Thomas King, who were all stars of the Georgian stage.Watts, pp. 47–56 After Hippisley's death in 1748, the business was continued by his widow.Powell, p. 18 When the Theatre Royal opened in King Street in 1776 most actors left the Jacobs Well Theatre as the new venue proved to be more fashionable.

Based near Placerville, California, the group has traveled to over 65 countries, performed over 7,000 concerts, produced 200 television programs, and recorded over 100 albums.September 2010 Heritage Singers Newsletter In 2014 the Loma Linda Broadcasting Network began re-playing their 30-minute shows three times each week with the new title of Heritage Singers Classics.A treasure of music just in time for the holidays! (press release by LLBN News, November 30, 2014) History After four years of performing with a patriotic/folk singing group to promote Portland-based United Medical Laboratories named Rose City Singers, the Maces decided to resign and form a Christian group in 1971. Pp. 4-5. Jerry Leiske named the group based on Bible scripture equating saints with God's \\"Heritage ... objects of His special care.\\" The first year, they released two albums (Come Along with the Heritage Singers and Hymns We Remember), and performed their first public concert in June. Early accompanists included Bob Silverman on piano and Pete McLeod and Jeff Wood on guitars. In 1974 the Heritage Singers collaborated with Ron Huff, who arranged their first albums with full orchestration. As their popularity grew (along with a television series, Heritage Singers Presents), they formed a second group in September 1974, dubbed Heritage II, (subsequently named New Creation) to perform mostly at cities located in the eastern half of the United States;Mace et al., ibid., p. 23 and a third group, Heritage Singers en Espanol, which tours South America singing Spanish versions of the group's signature songs.Mace et al., ibid., p. 101 More than 250 people (including Chris Willis)Undated (post-2004) interview with Chris Willis on Chicago's GoPride.com have performed as members of Heritage Singers; however, the Mace family has remained at its core. As for the religious affiliation of its members, Max Mace has stated that while a majority of them are Seventh-day Adventists, that's not in itself a requirement. \\"They have to be a born-again Christian and receptive to the Adventist message.\\" Reunions Celebratory reunion concerts have been held in 1979 (Swing Auditorium), 1986 (Anaheim Convention Center), 2001 (Ontario Convention Center), and 2005 (Crystal Cathedral).Mace et al., ibid., pp. 151, 155 A final 45th anniversary reunion was held at the Citizens Business Bank Arena on July 30, 2016 with 126 singers on stage.Names of 126 singers are listed in the closing credits of the DVD published in November 2016 (catalog no.

Harvey specialises in Baroque music. However, he also sings works by later composers, including contemporary ones. Harvey was a choral scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied languages before switching to music. He then went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Harvey is known for his performances of Bach. He was a soloist in the Monteverdi Choir's Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000; he completed the bass parts in seventy cantatas in performance and recording. He has since contributed to the Bach cycle being recorded by the J. S. Bach-Stiftung with the conductor Rudolf Lutz. He also has founded his own group, the Magdalena Consort, which released its first commercial recording in 2014: it consists of Bach cantatas performed \\"one voice per part\\". Harvey has also collaborated with Harry Christophers and The Sixteen, with Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music, with Gérard Lesne and Il Seminario Musicale, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and the Gabrieli Consort. He has appeared as St. John in a televised performance of John Tavener's The Cry of the Icon. In 2007 he undertook a U.S. tour with the Netherlands Bach Society and completed a series of performances of Gabriel Fauré's Requiem with the Ensemble Vocal de Lausanne, conducted by Michel Corboz, in Japan. With Roger Vignoles, he performed at the festivals in Cambridge and Lugo Schubert's Winterreise. Harvey has recorded more than 80 albums, including Bach's Passions and cantatas, cantatas by Dieterich Buxtehude, motets by Jean- Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau, sacred music by Monteverdi and Mozart's Requiem.

He was born and educated in London, studying at King's College School, then King's College London, followed by King's College Hospital. The final years of his medical training were interrupted by the First World War, during which he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps. After the war, he qualified as a surgeon and studied with laryngologists in France and the USA before resuming his career at King's College Hospital where he became a junior surgeon in 1924. In the 1920s, Negus worked on aspects of both throat surgery and the anatomy of the larynx, the latter work contributing to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes, oesophagoscopes, an operating table, and tracheotomy equipment. His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) and his work on the clinical text Diseases of the Nose and Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology. He became a senior surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1940 and a consulting surgeon in 1946. Negus was one of the founders of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists, helping to establish his speciality as a discipline within the newly formed National Health Service. He was a member of numerous international and national otolaryngology organisations, and presided over the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology in London in 1949. In this period of his career following the Second World War he also worked on the anatomy of the paranasal sinuses, and played a key role in rebuilding and establishing collections of animal dissections used by comparative anatomists. Negus, who married in 1929 and had two sons, retired in 1952, though he continued to publish on comparative anatomy and the history of medicine. His honours before and after retirement included the Fellowship of King's College, London (1945), an honorary degree (1950), the Lister Medal (1954), a knighthood (1956), honorary fellowships of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (1949) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (1958), and the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (1969). He died in Hindhead, Surrey, aged 87 in 1974. Early life and education The chapel of King's College, where Negus studied at university Victor Ewings Negus was born on 6 February 1887 in Tooting, London, the youngest of three sons of William and Emily Negus (née Ewings). His father was a solicitor, Justice of the Peace, and Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Surrey. Victor's pre-university education took place at King's College School. In 1906, he was awarded a Sambrooke scholarship to King's College London, on the Strand, where his studies for the next three years included premedical and preclinical subjects. After passing the required examinations, Negus proceeded in 1909 to the next stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King's College Hospital, at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln's Inn Fields. Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the MRCS and LRCP (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, known as the 'conjoint diploma'), marking his formal qualification to practice medicine. In the final year of these studies, Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord Lister at Westminster Abbey. Another connection with Lister's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne, who had himself been house surgeon to Lister. The postgraduate stages of Negus's training involved specialisation in diseases of the ear, nose and throat, a direction influenced and guided by the otorhinolaryngologist St Clair Thomson (1857–1943). In the years following his qualification in 1912, Negus worked at King's College Hospital, and had started further clinical training at the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in Golden Square, Soho, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. Negus served in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) with the British Expeditionary Force for the first 18 months of the war. He initially deployed with the 1st General Hospital, then saw action in the trenches on the front line with a machine-gun battalion at the First Battle of Ypres. The effects of explosives during this period left him with tinnitus. This was followed by a period serving on hospital barges. In 1916, Negus, still with the RAMC, was posted to the 3rd (Lahore) Division (part of the British Indian Army) and took part in the Mesopotamia Campaign. As one of those who had deployed to the Western Front in the opening months of the war, he was later awarded the Mons Star. His service in the RAMC ended in 1919. Surgical career and family The structure of the larynx, in which Negus specialised Following his discharge from the army, Negus, again with the advice and guidance of St Clair Thomson, resumed his studies and preparations for a career in throat surgery. By 1921 he had graduated MB BS (London) [Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery] and by 1922 he had taken the surgical exams for the FRCS (Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons) qualification. To gain further experience, he spent periods of time abroad studying with renowned laryngologists: firstly with Emil Moure and Georges Portmann in Bordeaux, France; and secondly with Chevalier Jackson in Philadelphia, USA. On his return to London, he became clinical assistant to St Clair Thomson at King's College Hospital. At this point, still early in his surgical career, Negus took a different approach to that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years.For details of Negus's work on comparative anatomy, see the comparative anatomy section of this article. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy. In 1929, Negus married Winifred Adelaide Gladys Rennie (1901–1980, known as Eve) with whom he would have two sons, David (1930–2010) and Richard (1932–2008). Negus's surgical and medical teaching career continued to progress, and he was appointed surgeon in 1931. It was in 1937 that his major work in clinical medicine, the fourth edition of Diseases of the Nose and Throat, was published. This work, \\"still used for reference\\", was described as \\"for many years the standard textbook in English on this subject\\", and as Negus's \\"major literary contribution to clinical medicine\\". The 1937 edition continued work on earlier editions by St Clair Thomson, who worked jointly with Negus on the new edition. A fifth edition worked on by both men was published in 1948 following Thomson's death, and the sixth edition by Negus alone appeared in 1955. In 1939, the Negus family moved to Haslemere, Surrey. During the Second World War, Negus again served in a medical capacity, this time with the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) at Horton Hospital, Epsom, from 1939 to 1946. In 1940, on the retirement of his colleague Charles Hope, he had been appointed senior surgeon at King's College Hospital, and in 1946 he reached the peak of his profession as a consulting surgeon. During this post-war period one of Negus's patients was the former (and future) prime minister Winston Churchill, who in 1950 was diagnosed by Negus with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Negus retired from clinical and teaching work in 1952 at the age of 65. Comparative anatomy In parallel with his career as a throat surgeon at a teaching hospital, Negus become a leading expert on the comparative anatomy of first the larynx and then the nose and the paranasal sinuses. This strand of his professional life started with the research he carried out in his thirties in the 1920s that eventually led to his degree of Master of Surgery (MS), awarded by the University of London. This work started as early as 1921 in the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, whose museum housed the collections of animal specimens gathered by the anatomist John Hunter. Working on these specimens, and adding to them with others supplied by the Zoological Society of London, Negus carried out meticulous dissections that enabled him to trace the stages of evolution and development of the larynx across a wide variety of animals. Part of this research was submitted as his thesis, and the excellence of the work was recognised by the award of a Gold Medal with his MS degree in 1924. In addition to this, Negus gave the Arris and Gale Lecture on 28 April 1924 at the Royal College of Surgeons, with his talk titled \\"On the Mechanism of the Larynx\\". Further recognition of his work came when Negus was made Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1925, followed three years later in 1928 by the awarding of the triennial John Hunter Medal (1925–7) from the Royal College of Surgeons, which came with a prize of £50. The following year Negus published his observations and conclusions in The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929), a \\"classic piece of research\\" still referred to forty-five years later in 1974 as \\"the standard reference book\\" on this topic. Negus's work had shown that the main function of the larynx is as a valve that only allows air into the lower respiratory tract. In humans, the voice is only a byproduct of this more vital function. Another lecture resulting from this work was given under the auspices of the University of London's Semon Lectureship, named after the German-born British laryngologist Felix Semon (1849–1921). This talk was delivered on 6 November 1930 at the Royal Society of Medicine under the title \\"Observations on Semon's Law\\". These earlier works were followed after the Second World War by the publication of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Larynx (1949). This work was a condensed and updated version of Negus's original 1929 work on the larynx. It was in this post-war period that Negus would increasingly study the function of the nose, both as the organ for the sense of smell (olfaction) and the role of the nose in respiration. This was prompted by wartime damage in 1941 to the Royal College of Surgeons' Hunterian Museum, which included the loss of parts of the Onodi Collection. This collection had contained specimens of the accessory sinuses (paranasal sinuses) prepared by the Hungarian laryngologist Adolf Onodi (1857–1919) and demonstrated by him in 1900. Negus undertook to replace the destroyed and damaged specimens and to extend the collection with animal specimens. This work was covered in Negus's Hunterian Lecture, delivered on 20 May 1954 at the Royal College of Surgeons under the title \\"Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses\\". This was followed four years later by the publication of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses (1958). Much of this later work was carried out after retirement in 1952, both at the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons and at the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology at the Middlesex Hospital. Negus's research over many years on these topics and their relation to nose and throat surgery led to the awarding of the 1954 Lister Medal. This was presented the following year when Negus delivered the Lister Oration on 5 April 1955 at the Royal College of Surgeons. The oration was titled \\"The Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory Tract in Relation to Clinical Problems\\". Ten years later, towards the end of his life, Negus published The Biology of Respiration (1965). Negus's legacy in this field was assessed in 1986 by the British surgeon and comparative anatomist Sir Donald Frederick Norris Harrison, himself an expert on the mammalian larynx. Writing further on the subject in 1995, Harrison states that Negus's \\"pioneer research into the mechanism of the animal larynx [...] established him as a unique comparative anatomist.\\"See the section 'Sir Victor Negus' (pp.16–17) in Harrison quotes from the Scottish anatomist Sir Arthur Keith's preface to The Mechanism of the Larynx. In this preface, Negus's 1929 work is described as showing \\"the same patient power of assembling observation after observation as Darwin had and some of the hot pursuit of function as urged by Hunter\\". Societies and administration The Royal College of Surgeons of England, at Lincoln's Inn Fields, London As one of the leading practitioners in his speciality, Negus served in many roles in its organisation and administration at both a national and international level. In particular, he worked closely with the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the body responsible for the accreditation and representation of surgeons practising in England and Wales, and also the organisation that supported him in his researches in comparative anatomy. The Royal College of Surgeons is located in London, and from 1939 to 1941 he was President of its Listerian Society. In 1942, Negus was President of the Section of Laryngology at the Royal Society of Medicine. When Negus had been training as a surgeon, laryngology, rhinology and otology had been part of general surgery, but this was changing with the advent of ENT (ear, nose and throat) medicine as a combined and specialised discipline. Negus and colleagues attempted to set up the necessary structure within the Royal Society of Medicine to represent their profession as an emerging speciality, but the regulations in place would not allow the type of organisation they had planned. This led them, in 1943, to found the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists which would be able to represent ENT surgeons through the Royal College of Surgeons. Following the war, Negus was co-opted to the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1947, and was the first to represent otolaryngology at that level. He was also a member of the college's Court of Examiners, and worked to set up the first examination in otorhinolaryngology that could be taken for the FRCS diploma. This reorganisation was taking place against a background of immense change in how medicine was practised in the UK, due to the advent of the National Health Service (NHS). Negus's colleague, Geoffrey Bateman, writing in 1974, credits him with having the foresight to represent the interests of otolaryngology and see it established as a major speciality in its own right within the NHS. Negus became President of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists in 1951, and this was one of a number of presidencies he held, including that of the Thoracic Society (1949–50) and the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology. The latter was a large event that took place in London over a week in July 1949. It was held in the Great Hall of King's College, London, and was attended by over 700 otolaryngology specialists from 39 countries. The patron was King George VI and the congress was opened by the Duchess of Kent. Negus was President and host for the 1954 annual meeting of the Collegium Oto- rhino-laryngologicum Amicitiae Sacrum (CORLAS), held in London from 29 August to 1 September, and was the treasurer of CORLAS from 1936 to 1950. Negus was also associated with, and gave talks to, numerous medical societies in the UK and abroad, with his connections ranging from honorary fellowships to corresponding and honorary memberships. These foreign societies included the American Broncho-Esophagological Association, and the countries included Sweden, Denmark, Canada, the USA, Austria, France, Italy, Hungary, and Turkey. Bateman opined in his obituary of Negus that it seemed unlikely that any other British ENT surgeon \\"has been honoured by so many societies\\". Following his retirement, Negus continued his involvement with the Royal College of Surgeons, becoming a trustee (and later chairman of the trustees) of the Hunterian Collection, the same collection that included the specimens that had underpinned his research some thirty years earlier. He also published books on the history of the college and its collections: The History of the Trustees of the Hunterian Collection (1965); and The Artistic Possessions at the Royal College of Surgeons of England (1968). Honours, awards and legacy In his later years, Negus received many awards and honours. In 1945, he was made a Fellow of King's College, London. On 25 July 1949, he received the honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Further tributes followed as an honorary Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) was conferred on him on 17 May 1950 by the University of Manchester. Back in London, the Royal Society of Medicine made him an honorary fellow in 1954. Two years later, Negus was made a knight bachelor with the investiture taking place at Buckingham Palace on 7 February 1956. On 28 August 1958, it was the turn of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to bestow their honorary fellowship on him. In addition to these awards, Negus continued to give lectures, including an Erasmus Wilson demonstration awarded by the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1953, and the Johns Hopkins Lecture on 30 April 1957. Negus also received the 1963 Gould Award from the William and Harriet Gould Foundation of Chicago, USA, \\"for his monumental contributions to the science of laryngology\\". On 13 February 1969, Negus and two others (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were presented with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for \\"liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art.\\" The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: \\"Sir Victor Negus is perhaps the most distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense.\\" Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: \\"I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I would also like to thank you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done.\\" Negus died in Hindhead, Surrey, on 15 July 1974, at the age of 87, survived by his wife and children. Negus's status in the history of laryngology in the UK was remarked on in his obituary in The Times, which stated that he \\"made a worthy fourth to Morell Mackenzie, Felix Semon, and St Clair Thomson\\". Obituaries also appeared in a range of medical journals. In due course, biographical entries appeared in volume 6 of Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (1988) and in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). Two photographic portraits of Negus are held in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London. As well as archives relating to Negus, the Royal College of Surgeons of England houses in its one of its reserve collections (the Hunterian Museum Collection) over 200 sagittal sections of animals dissected by him. Additional collections of bisected animal heads prepared by Negus are held at the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in London.

Van der Meer introduced Nikolaus Harnoncourt in the Netherlands in 1970. The regular orchestra, the Noordelijk Filharmonisch Orkest, was not available for a performance of Bach's Magnificat, instead van der Meer could work with Harnoncourt's Concentus Musicus Wien. Van der Meer focused on period instruments, all male voices for the soloists, musical rhetoric and dramatic declamation. In 1973 he conducted the Groningse Bachvereniging in the first historically informed performance in the Netherlands of Bach's St Matthew Passion.Tijdschrift van de Koninklijke Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis Volume 50 2000 \\"1973 präsentierte Johan van der Meer seine erste 'authentische' Matthäus-Passion in den Niederlanden mit dem Groninger Bachverein, der Musica da Camera und Mitgliedern des Leonhardt Consort. \\" The Evangelist was Marius van Altena, the vox Christi was Max van Egmond, the other soloists were three boys of the Tölzer Knabenchor, René Jacobs, Harry Geraerts, Michiel ten Houte de Lange, Frits van Erven Dorens and Harry van der Kamp.

This is too faint to be seen with the naked eye; viewing it requires a telescope with an aperture of or more. A subdwarf B star, Kepler-70 passed through the red giant stage some 18.4 million years ago. In its present-day state, it is fusing helium in its core. Once it runs out of helium it will contract to form a white dwarf. It has a relatively small radius of about 0.2 times the Sun's radius; white dwarfs are generally much smaller. The star may be host to a planetary system with two planets, although later research indicates that this is not in fact the case. If they are confirmed to exist, then the innermost planet has the highest temperature of any known planet known so far. Planetary system On December 26, 2011, evidence for two extremely short- period planets, Kepler-70b and Kepler-70c, was announced by Charpinet et al. They were detected by the reflection of starlight caused by the planets themselves, rather than through a variation in apparent stellar magnitude caused by them transiting the star. The measurements also suggested a smaller body between the two confirmed planets; this remains unconfirmed. If these planets exist, then the orbits of Kepler-70b and Kepler-70c have 7:10 orbital resonance and have the closest approach between planets of any known planetary system. However, later research suggested that what had been detected was not in fact the reflection of light from exoplanets, but star pulsation \\"visible beyond the cut-off frequency of the star.\\" Further research indicated that star pulsation modes were indeed the more likely explanation for the signals found in 2011, and that the two exoplanets probably did not exist.

Forming on December 31, 2011 off the coast of New Jersey, Ulli began a rapid strengthening phase on January 2 as it sped across the Atlantic. Ulli was the costliest disaster in January 2012 globally. The damage from the storm in Glasgow was also compared to a storm in 1968. (Accessed through LexisNexis) Ulli was one of many storms to affect Europe during the winter of 2011-2012. The storm clustering began in late-November when Xaver and Yoda hit the United Kingdom and Norway. In early to mid-December, Friedhelm, Hergen and Joachim hit northern Europe. Another storm, Patrick hit Scandinavia on Christmas Day. Ulli was followed by Andrea which formed the next day and struck northern Europe on 5 January. Meteorological history Weather map on January 3rd, 2012 The system was first noted over the United States Midwest as a surface trough. The storm moved offshore on December 31, 2011, when it was named Ulli by the Free University of Berlin. The low deepened slightly to by January 1, 2012 while south of Nova Scotia. By January 2, the storm system was located just east of Newfoundland. From 1800 UTC January 2 to 0000 UTC January 3, the barometric pressure of Ulli plummeted from to . By midnight on January 3, Ulli was situated to the northwest of Scotland. The storm then made landfall on Scotland during the early morning the same day with a central pressure of . Hours later, the storm was named Emil by the Norwegian Weather Service. By January 4, the storm was centered over southern Norway and it slowly moved across to Finland the next day. Ulli began to rapidly weaken as it stalled on January 6, and was absorbed by Windstorm Andrea on January 7. The storm has been proposed as displaying a Sting jet. Preparation In the late hours of January 1, Met Éireann issued a national severe weather warning for Connacht and Ulster and forecasters predicting winds speeds up to 87 mph with heavy driving rain. On January 2, the Met Office issued an amber weather warning for most of Scotland for heavy snow and strong winds. Forecasters predicted wind speeds up to 80 mph, and heavy rain, leading to localized flooding. During the late hours of January 2, the European Storm Forecast Experiment (ESTOFEX) issued a Level Two warning for southeast England, the Netherlands, north Belgium, north Germany and Denmark. Naming All low pressure areas that affect Europe are named by the Free University of Berlin. On some occasions, storms that affect Norway are named by the Norwegian Weather Service. The Free University of Berlin have six lists of names which they use each year. Every odd year they use male names, while every even year they use female names. Impact United Kingdom and Ireland Containers blown down at Greenock Ocean Terminal in the wake of Ulli. Prior to the passage of Ulli, many parts of the UK saw heavy squally downpours on January 2. On January 3, the Kingston, Erskine, Tay and Forth bridges were closed due to high winds. Major travel disruption which resulted in many bus, rail and ferry services being withdrawn. Winds gusted to in Edinburgh and in Malin Head. Wind gusts were higher in Great Dun Fell in the North Pennines, where winds gusted to . The storm hit Scotland during a public holiday which helped reduced the number of people travelling about. A man was killed in Kent after an oak tree fell on his car, while another man was killed after being injured on board a tanker in the English Channel. A man was later reported missing in Scotland. Ten- thousand people were left without power in Northern Ireland due to the storm. While in Scotland approximately 140,000 homes were left without power, by 5 January the number had dropped to around 10,000. During the course of the storm over 488 weather-related incidents were reported in Strathclyde area, with 170 being reported in the Lothians, and Fife having more than a 100 reports. A tornado, which uprooted trees and damaged roofs, touched down in Hainault, London later in the day. Another tornado was reported about 30 minutes later in Clacton-on-Sea. Epsom Downs Racecourse was evacuated after sustaining partial damage to the roof of the grandstand. Over 90 severe wind gust reports were submitted to the European Severe Weather Database. Torrential downpours affected parts of southern England and into France. The Met Office were also criticized because of the late upgrade from amber to red warnings in the Central Belt. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) also issued 10 flood warnings and 12 flood alerts for Scotland. Netherlands and Germany The Dutch Coastguard reported a meteotsunami at IJmuiden on January 3 with sea level rising and falling in just 30 minutes as the storm passed. In Germany on January 3, a storm warning was issued for the North Sea coast and higher altitudes. Trucks were blown over by winds in North Rhine-Westphalia. In the same area, one family had their roof blown off their house. Coastal regions were also battered by large waves with ferry passengers having to walk through flood water to disembark. An infant in a pram was also blown into a canal by strong winds near Hannover. His mother dived in to save him and both survived. Denmark and Sweden Ulli was the strongest storm in Denmark in seven years. Winds from the storm began to affect Jutland on the afternoon of January 3. In Skagen a 300 square metre roof of a fish processing factory was blown off. A ferry broke loose in the storm requiring two tugs to secure it, and ferry links between Denmark and Norway were cancelled. In Aalborg high winds brought down a gable wall of a student block at Construction College, toppled scaffolding, and brought down a five-story glazed aluminium staircase. The storm continued across the Kattegat to affect the Swedish west coast with power outages, blocked roads and cancellation of train services. Aftermath Forecasters began to predict another storm that would make its way across the North Sea in the coming days, which had already named Andrea. Winds were expected to reach on Wednesday night into Thursday in Germany. German meteorologists said that the new storm looked more toxic than Ulli. They also said that Andrea was stronger than Ulli, however, the storm was weaker than Kyrill. The Met Office issued yellow warnings for wind and rain for parts of England and Wales. Due to the unstable post-frontal environment, SkyWarn UK issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Scotland, Wales and the east coast of England for January 4 and January 5. Since dawn on January 4, hundreds of engineers were trying to restore power to over 50,000 homes in the UK.

She has been a Democratic Party member of the Michigan House of Representatives and Minority Whiphttp://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2012/11/saginaws_rep_erwin_oakes_named.html representing Michigan's 95th District (map), located in Saginaw County, which includes the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee, in addition to the following townships: Bridgeport Township, Buena Vista Township, Carrollton Township, James Township, Kochville Township, Spaulding Township, and Zilwaukee Township. Educational background A product of the Saginaw Public School District, Oakes attended Houghton Elementary, Arthur Eddy Junior High, and Saginaw High School where she graduated from in 1991. She obtained a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Ferris State University and later earned her teaching certification while working as a corrections officer at the Saginaw Correctional Facility. Oakes earned her law degree from Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University while working for the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. While at MSU, she was an instructor for the Rental Housing Clinic. Professional background After obtaining her teaching certificate, she accepted a position with the Saginaw Public School system and taught at Central Middle and Saginaw High schools while coaching girls' basketball. Upon her graduation from law school, Oakes accepted a position with the Michigan House of Representatives as a policy analyst. She was later appointed to the Michigan Attorney General's office, serving under both Jennifer Granholm and Mike Cox. As an assistant attorney general, she prosecuted and defended cases throughout the state of Michigan. In February 2010, Oakes was appointed to the MSU College of Law Board of Trustees. Currently, Oakes serves as lead developer of Erwin Properties, LLC, which developed Erwin Senior Estates in Buena Vista Township. Political career Oakes was elected as State Representative for the 95th District in a November 2010 special election to fill the remainder of the term for the seat vacated by Andy Coulouris. Under Michigan's legislative term limits, Coulouris was eligible for one additional term as a State Representative. As opposed to running for reelection in 2010, Coulouris instead announced that he would not seek a third term. With the departure of Oakes' predecessor and her subsequent election to the Michigan House of Representatives, she served in the legislature for the lame duck session of 2010. In that election, she won a full term of her own which began in January 2011. In December 2011, Oakes appeared as a guest on Off the Record (WKAR TV series), a weekly, political talk program broadcast statewide on PBS member stations throughout Michigan. Off The Record is hosted by Michigan's senior capitol correspondent, Tim Skubick. The topic of discussion included Michigan's Medical Marijuana law and Oakes' future political ambitions. Oakes sits on the House Agricultural Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. In addition, she also sits on the Michigan Legislative Council. She ran for a second term as State Representative for the 95th district in the November 2012 general election. In August 2012, Oakes was appointed to fill a vacancy on the House Transportation Committee. In February 2012, it was announced that Rep. Oakes would be a member of Obama for America's Truth Team. The Truth Team intends to secure grassroots and online supporters to promote President Barack Obama’s presidential achievements while holding Republicans accountable. On November 6, 2012, Rep. Oakes was reelected to a second term, defeating her opponent with 77.53% of the vote. Oakes ran unsuccessfully for Michigan's 32nd district Senate seat in 2014, but was soundly defeated by now-Senator Ken Horn (R-Frankenmuth). Post political career Oakes was appointed by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver as the city of Flint's chief legal officer in April 2016. In accepting the job, she said that playing a crucial role in the Flint saga was important for her because everything else depends on how she and her team approach the legal challenges ahead. Mayor Weaver praised Oakes for her abilities: \\"Stacy is held in high regard by the legal community. In a statement on January 3, 2017, Mayor Weaver's office confirmed that the city had \\"parted ways\\" with City Attorney Oakes but did not provide any additional details. According to her termination letter, Weaver questioned Oakes leadership and her ability to lead the department: \\"The effectiveness of your management and oversight of the City of Flint's Legal Department is questionable and I lack confidence in your leadership.\\" It was reported on April 3, 2017 that Oakes had filed a whistle-blower lawsuit against Weaver and the city of Flint, alleging she was dismissed for objecting to \\"fraudulent legal documents\\" and other illegal acts. Personal life Representative Oakes is the daughter of James and Maggie Erwin. She is the youngest girl of six sisters and six brothers. Oakes and her husband, attorney Michael Oakes, have two children, Michael II and Kingston. They worship at New Mt. Calvary Missionary Baptist Church in Saginaw.

Ashland, Oregon, June 21, 2011) was a nationally renowned American runner, best known for his ability to compete at the elite level in numerous marathons each year. Sayre’s most noted achievement was winning the inaugural Los Angeles Marathon in 1986 with a career-best time of 2 hours, 12 minutes, and 59 seconds. The next year, in 1987, Sayre won the United States national marathon championship. He was also one of only four American men who have qualified in the marathon for the U.S. Olympic Trials five times. Sayre also excelled as a trail runner. Sayre routinely competed in seven to eight marathons a year; of the fifty he competed in during his career, he won a dozen. Sayre, who was a lean 135 pounds, at five feet, ten and a half inches, credited his vegetarian diet with helping him recover quickly from races. \\"Most (marathoners) run in one or two marathons a year,\\" Sayre said. \\"They'll run once in the spring and once in the fall. They say that it takes you a day for each mile you run to recover. \\"But it takes me four days to a week to recover. I think part of it has to do with my diet and part has to do with psychology.\\" He finished seventh overall in the 1987 Houston Marathon, which served as the U.S. marathon Championship. As the first American finisher in Houston, he qualified for that year's Pan American Games in Indianapolis, Indiana. Sayre developed as an athlete as a member of the Summit Athletic Club in Akron, Ohio. Los Angeles Marathon Sayre's victory in the 1986 Los Angeles Marathon, with a time of 2:12:59, earned him $10,000 and a $23,000 Mercedes-Benz, which he sold to help finance a home he built in Ashland. His time ranked him in the top ten among U. S. Marathoners for 1986; he was again ranked among the top ten Americans in 1987. Collegiate career Sayre was a two-time NAIA All-American in cross country for Walsh University, in North Canton, Ohio. The Ric Sayre Invitational Cross Country Meet is held in North Canton each year, at Sayre's alma mater. Marathon prodigy In 1985, Sayre won the National Capital Marathon in Ottawa, with a time of 2:16:18. In 1987, he won the Melbourne Marathon in 2:14:16. Ashland trail running pioneer Sayre was a longtime Ashland, Oregon resident, having moved there in 1981 to take advantage of favorable training conditions there. Subsequently, he has been accorded acclaim as Ashland's \\"original trail runner\\", as a vibrant running community has sprung up since his arrival, in large part due to the many established running trails in the vicinity, that he used frequently. “He was so good, he just kind of set the standard for toughness,” according to Bob Julian Jr., the cross country coach for Ashland High School. “He basically was the standard around here, and nobody could compete with him. Ric wasn’t just about running. He was a pretty humble guy, pretty quiet. He’d always stand up for people and would help them out if they were having rough times.” He was the 1982 Pear Blossom Run champion in Medford, Oregon and set the current course record at the Mt. Ashland Hill Climb. Sayre worked fourteen years at the Ashland Food Cooperative, where he was serving his third three-year term as the employee representative on the co-op's board of directors.

He is known for writing the chorale \\"Meinen Jesum laß ich nicht\\" in 1658, which served as the base for Bach's chorale cantata Meinen Jesum laß ich nicht, BWV 124, and other compositions. Career Keymann was born in Pankratz, Habsburg Bohemia, in 1607, the son of Zacharias Keimann, a Lutheran pastor. From 1627 to 1634, he studied at the University of Wittenberg. After graduation he worked at the gymnasium of Zittau, first as associate director, then as rector in 1638. He died of a stroke in 1662. Hymns Two of his most popular hymns were translated into English; \\"O rejoice, ye Christians, loudly\\" (\\"Freuet euch, ihr Christen alle\\") found in Chorale Book, No. 33, and \\"Jesus will I never leave\\" (\\"Meinen Jesum laß ich nicht\\") found in United Brethren's Hymn Book, No. 464. Donald G. Bloesch in his book The struggle of prayer (1980) describes it as a \\"moving hymn\\". His hymns in general have been described as \\"being of genuine poetic ring, fresh, strong, full of faith under manifold and heavy trials, and deeply spiritual\\". Music Keymann collaborated with composer Andreas Hammerschmidt who created tunes for Keymann's hymns. In 1646, a collection of hymns Mnemosyne sacra was published by Keymann in Leipzig, including five tunes by Hammerschmidt. In 1658, the collection Fest-, Buß- und Danklieder (Songs for feast, repentance and thanks) was printed in Zittau, containing the hymn \\"Meinen Jesum laß ich nicht\\" (I will not let go of my Jesus). In 1725, Johann Sebastian Bach based his chorale cantata for the first Sunday after Epiphany on this entire hymn, but he also used single stanzas in other cantatas, from the same chorale in Wachet! betet! betet! wachet! BWV 70, Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan, BWV 98 and Mein liebster Jesus ist verloren, BWV 154. In the first (1727/1729) version of his St Matthew Passion, Part I was concluded with the final stanza of the chorale, \\"Jesum laß ich nicht von mir\\" (Jesus I'll not let leave me). He used a stanza from \\"Freuet euch, ihr Christen alle\\" (Be joyful, all ye Christians, 1646), also on a melody by Hammerschmidt, in Darzu ist erschienen der Sohn Gottes, BWV 40. Max Reger based three compositions on \\"Meinen Jesum laß ich nicht\\", a chorale prelude (Op. 67 No.26, 1902), a composition for soprano, mixed choir, violin, viola and Organ (1905), and again a chorale prelude (Op. 135a No. 17, 1914). Sigfrid Karg-Elert wrote a chorale improvisation for organ (Fughetta), Op. 65 No 49. References Sources *Christian Weise: Memoria Christiani Keimani.

In mathematics, the Hadamard product (also known as the element-wise, entrywise or Schur product) is a binary operation that takes two matrices of the same dimensions and produces another matrix of the same dimension as the operands, where each element is the product of elements of the original two matrices. It is to be distinguished from the more common matrix product. It is attributed to, and named after, either French mathematician Jacques Hadamard or German mathematician Issai Schur. The Hadamard product is associative and distributive. Unlike the matrix product, it is also commutative. Definition For two matrices and of the same dimension , the Hadamard product A \\\\circ B (or A \\\\odot B) is a matrix of the same dimension as the operands, with elements given by :(A \\\\circ B)_{ij} = (A \\\\odot B)_{ij} = (A)_{ij} (B)_{ij}. For matrices of different dimensions ( and , where or ), the Hadamard product is undefined. Example For example, the Hadamard product for a 3 × 3 matrix with a 3 × 3 matrix is : \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\circ \\\\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} & b_{13}\\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{21} & b_{22} & b_{23}\\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{31} & b_{32} & b_{33} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11}\\\\, b_{11} & a_{12}\\\\, b_{12} & a_{13}\\\\, b_{13}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21}\\\\, b_{21} & a_{22}\\\\, b_{22} & a_{23}\\\\, b_{23}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{31}\\\\, b_{31} & a_{32}\\\\, b_{32} & a_{33}\\\\, b_{33} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Properties The mixed- product property : (A \\\\otimes B) \\\\circ (C \\\\otimes D) = (A \\\\circ C) \\\\otimes (B \\\\circ D) , where \\\\otimes is Kronecker product : (A \\\\bull B) \\\\circ (C \\\\bull D) = (A \\\\circ C) \\\\bull (B \\\\circ D) , where \\\\bull denotes Face-splitting product. : (A \\\\bull B)(C \\\\ast D) = (A C) \\\\circ (B D), where \\\\ast is column- wise Khatri–Rao product. Schur product theorem The Hadamard product of two positive-semidefinite matrices is positive-semidefinite. This is known as the Schur product theorem, after Russian mathematician Issai Schur. For two positive-semidefinite matrices and , it is also known that the determinant of their Hadamard product is greater than or equal to the product of their respective determinants: :\\\\det(\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{B}) \\\\ge \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{A}) \\\\det(\\\\mathbf{B}). In programming languages Hadamard multiplication is built into certain programming languages under various names. In MATLAB, GNU Octave, GAUSS and HP Prime, it is known as array multiplication, or in Julia broadcast multiplication, with the symbol \`.*\`. In Fortran, R, APL, J and Wolfram Language (Mathematica), it is done through simple multiplication operator \`*\`, whereas the matrix product is done through the function \`matmul\`, \`%*%\`, \`+.×\`, \`+/ .*\` and the \`.\` operators, respectively. In Python with the NumPy numerical library or the SymPy symbolic library, multiplication of \`array\` objects as \`a1*a2\` produces the Hadamard product, but otherwise multiplication as \`a1@a2\` or \`matrix\` objects \`m1*m2\` will produce a matrix product. The Eigen C++ library provides a \`cwiseProduct\` member function for the \`Matrix\` class (\`a.cwiseProduct(b)\`), while the Armadillo library uses the operator \`%\` to make compact expressions (\`a % b\`; \`a * b\` is a matrix product). Applications The Hadamard product appears in lossy compression algorithms such as JPEG. The decoding step involves an entry-for-entry product, in other words the Hadamard product. It is also used in the machine learning literature, for example to describe the architecture of recurrent neural networks as GRUs or LSTMs. Analogous operations Other Hadamard operations are also seen in the mathematical literature, namely the Hadamard root and Hadamard power (which are in effect the same thing because of fractional indices), defined for a matrix such that: For :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{B} &= \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\circ 2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_{ij} &= {A_{ij}}^2 \\\\end{align} and for :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{B} &= \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\circ \\\\frac12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_{ij} &= {A_{ij}}^\\\\frac12 \\\\end{align} The Hadamard inverse reads: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{B} &= \\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\circ -1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ B_{ij} &= {A_{ij}}^{-1} \\\\end{align} A Hadamard division is defined as: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{C} &= \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\oslash \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{ij} &= \\\\frac{A_{ij}}{B_{ij}} \\\\end{align}  The penetrating face product  The penetrating face product of matrices According to the definition of V.

He has also received Distinguished Alumnus Award from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, India. Previous to his position at Harvard and Google, he was Helen N. and Emmett H. Jones Professor in Engineering and a Professor of Computer Science and Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Milind Tambe’s research focuses on advancing AI and multi-agent systems research for social good. Examples of topics he has worked on include: (i) AI for conservation; (iii) AI for public health and social work; and (iii) AI for public safety and security. His research focuses on fundamental problems in computational game theory, machine learning, automated planning, intelligent agents, and multi-agent interactions that are driven by these topics, ensuring a virtuous cycle of research and real-world applications. Prof. Tambe has contributed several foundational papers in Artificial Intelligence in these areas, for which he has received influential paper and best paper awards at a number of premier Artificial Intelligence Conferences and workshops, such as IJCAI, AAMAS and others. This research has led to significant practical impact, such as use of the green security games framework to assist wildlife conservation around the world, use of social networks and machine learning to assist in improving public health outcomes such as HIV prevention, and the use of pioneering security games research for security optimization by agencies such as the US Coast Guard and the Federal Air Marshals Service. A key example is the PAWS AI system developed by him and his team that has been deployed in collaboration with wildlife conservation agencies to assist rangers around the world. PAWS has helped rangers in removing 1000s of traps used to kill endangered wildlife in national parks in countries such Cambodia and Uganda. Furthermore, PAWS is integrated with the SMART software, making PAWS available for use at 100s of national parks around the globe. Other examples include research in collaboration with NGOs for improving maternal health care outcomes, for HIV prevention, TB prevention and others. For example, in a recently completed study with 700 youth experiencing homelessness, Prof. Tambe & team's algorithms led to a significant reduction in HIV risk behaviors compared to traditional approaches. In terms of public safety and security, the security games framework that Prof. Tambe pioneered has been deployed and tested for security optimization, both nationally and internationally, by agencies such as the US Coast Guard and the Federal Air Marshals Service. More specifically, his algorithms have been deployed by USA security agencies such as LAX police division, the Federal Air Marshals Service, the US Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration.

The Wing Chong Company was the largest employer of Chinese workers and artisans. Chu Lai had no difficulty finding employees because his store was a meeting-place for Chinese immigrants. He was married to four women, two in China and two in Canada. This arrangement was, according to historians, to facilitate the administration of his business on two continents. In 1885, Chu and another Chinese were accused of not having paid their annual $10 tax, which the Chinese Regulation Act had levied on all Asiatic adults in the province. Chu appealed to the British Columbia Supreme Court, which found that the tax was beyond the powers of the province. Chu Lai played an important role in the education of Chinese in the province, in protesting against the creation of a separate school system for the Chinese.

Allen (April 20, 1840 — July 30, 1900) was a United States soldier who fought in the American Civil War. Nathaniel was awarded the Medal of Honor - the United States' highest award for bravery during combat - for his actions at the Battle of Gettysburg. He was presented the award in 1899, a year before he died. Early life Nathaniel was born in Boston, Massachusetts on April 20, 1840. His father Gaius Allen, who came from Acton, was a former soldier who served in the Davis Blues Regiment during the War of 1812. As a young man, Nathaniel worked in Boston as a watchmaker. When the civil war broke out on April 12, 1861, he immediately enlisted into the 1st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry as a Private, on May 22, 1861, aged 21. In April 1862, he was promoted to Corporal of the Color Guard and maintained the rank for the rest of his military career. Battle of Gettysburg The Battle of Gettysburg started on July 1, 1863 and was fought until July 3, 1863. It was considered the turning point in the Civil War.Rawley, p. 147. It also created the highest number of casualties of the Civil War, with 23,055 Union troops killed, missing in action or wounded;Busey and Martin, p. 125. and 23,231 Confederate casualties.Busey and Martin, p. 260. Allen's battle started on July 2, one day into the battle. In the afternoon of that day, his regiment came under heavy small-arms fire from advancing Confederate infantry. In the midst of the fight, he was given the Regiment's U.S. flag from his wounded ensign William Eaton. Allen's commander then ordered the regiment to retreat from the advancing Confederates. Whilst retreating, Allen saw Sergeant William Kelren shot and killed - dropping the regimental flag beneath him. Allen immediately retrieved the flag from underneath Kelren’s body. He then ran back to his retreating regiment carrying both flags safely from the battlefield. It was for this action he was awarded the Medal of Honor. More than half of Allen’s regiment were killed or wounded in the battle. Later years Woodlawn Cemetery After the Civil War ended, Nathaniel returned to Boston where he continued his old trade as a watchmaker. Several years later, however, Nathaniel's eyesight began to fail, making it impossible to work as a watchmaker. He then moved in with his sisters in South Acton, where he lived for the rest of his life. Nathaniel was awarded his medal of honor on 29 March 1899. 36 years after the Battle of Gettysburg. Of the 1,527 Medals of Honor awarded for action in the Civil War, more than half were for capturing the flag of an enemy force or preventing one’s own flag from being captured. He died from nervous exhaustion and heart disease a year later on July 30, 1900, at age 60. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Acton.

Lydis was born in Vienna, Austria on August 24, 1887, under the name Marietta Ronsperger. She was the third child of Jewish merchants, Franz Ronsperger and Eugenia Fischer, and the sister of Richard and Edith Ronsperger, creator of Opera books who later died by suicide. Mariette first married Julius Koloman Pachoffer-Karñy in 1910. She eventually divorced Julius and married Jean Lydis in 1918 to whom she remained married until 1925. In 1928 she married Giuseppe Govone, an art publisher, and formally remained married to him until his death in 1948. However, at the end of the 30s she escaped Paris and the ensuing Nazi roundup of Jews to be briefly in England and from 1940 in Argentina. From 1940 until her death in 1970 she lived in Argentina, with her partner Erica Marx. Lydis lived openly as bisexual. She is best known for her book illustrations and paintings. Mariette died on April 26, 1970, and rests in the Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.  Biography  House of Mariette Lydis (1936)  Early life  Mariette Lydis (born Marietta Ronsperger) was born in Baden, Vienna, Austria on August 24, 1887. She was the daughter of Franz Ronsperger and Eugenia Fischer and had two siblings: Richard and Edith Ronsperger (creator of Opera books). According to her coworker and friend, Béla Balázs, Lydis did not like to discuss her personal family life, although it can be verified that the Ronsperger family was wealthy and that Lydis had a close relationship to her mother, Eugenia. Edith committed suicide in Florence in 1921 and her death had a profound effect on Lydis's life and art.  Career  Mariette Lydis started her art career as a young self-taught artist who got her start in the art world after traveling to France with Bontempelli in 1925, where she entered the art circles of Paris. Soon she developed a reputation as a talented painter and illustrator. Her first recorded illustration was that of The Cloak of Dreams by Béla Balázs. Additionally, Lydis illustrated Le Petit Jésus by Joseph Delteil. Later “she became a member of the Salon d’Autonne and held a solo exhibit at the Galerie Bernheim” and continued to illustrate books by many authors including Henry de Montherlant, Paul Valéry, Pierre Louÿs, Paul Verlaine, and Jules Supervielle. These works cemented her as an up-and- coming avant-garde artist and gave her name recognition for her future works. During World War II, Mariette Lydis fled Paris and, unable to exhibit her work, had a gap period where she prepared an exhibit intended to be held in Buenos Aires. She ended up staying in Buenos Aires for the majority of the 1940s, working with her then-husband Giuseppe Govone to publish some of her works, including Le Trefle a Quatre Feuilles: Ou La Clef Du Bonheur. In 1948 Mariette returned to France and worked under many French publishers and illustrated works for Guy de Maupassant, Colette, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Bella Moerel and Henry James. Lydis eventually returned to Buenos Aires due to the political tension of The Cold War and continued to publish art their until her death on April 26, 1970. During her career she had two prominent artist phases, her first being a darker sadder period where she concentrated on portraying poor people, the old men, the dispossessed, the criminals, and the sick. Later on in her life, her work became brighter and she began drawing and painting more women, adolescents, and young children's. Throughout her career she was influenced by the Japanese artist Tsuguharu Fourjita. Along with her illustrations, Lydis was known for her lithographic depictions celebrating lesbian and bisexual relationships. She illustrated women in the active- passive heterosexual relationship stereotype by portraying one woman with slightly masculine-looking features. Critics of her work in this style often described the illustrations as \\"perverse\\" and compared her work to Tamara de Lempicka, a female Polish painter. Joseph Delteil was one of these frequent critics. Today, her works are displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, and Davidson Galleries in Seattle, Washington.  Personal life  Mariette Lydis first married Julius Koloman Pachoffer-Karñy in 1910. Her second marriage was to Jean Lydis in 1920, and shortly after, the couple moved to Athens, Greece in 1922. Her second marriage was short-lived, as she left her husband for an affair with Bontempelli while in Florence (1925), and then with Joseph Delteil in Paris (1928). That same year, she met Compte Giuseppe Govone in France, and married him on August 1, 1934. Among other things, Govone was a publisher for a while, and helped produce many of Lydis's works. They stayed formally married until his death in Milan in 1948. However, already at the end for the 1930s, together with her partner, Erica Marx, she escaped Paris and the ensuing Nazi roundup of Jews. The couple lived for a brief time in Winchcombe, England before sailing as a refugee to Buenos Aires in July 1940. She and Marx lived and worked in Argentina until Lydis' death 1970. Lydis was also close to the aviator Amelia Earhart. It has been commonly stated that Lydis lived openly as a bisexual woman.  Legacy  Lydis never had children. Mariette Lydis operated a workshop where she trained future artists including Estela Pereda. Her work was included in the 2019 exhibition City Of Women: Female artists in Vienna from 1900 to 1938 at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.  Works  Illustrated book cover. Lydis, Mariette. Le Trefle a Quatre Feuilles : Ou La Clef Du Bonheur. Paris: G. Govone, 1935.  Style  Mariette Lydis was a printmaker who worked primarily in lithographs. Lydis was also a draughtswoman (of detailed technical drawings), illustrator, and painter. She worked in pencil, watercolor, charcoal, etching, and oil, producing prints, illuminated lithographic illustrations of stories and poetry, hand-colored drypoints, etchings, aquatints, drawings, and paintings. Her works rely heavily on the use of line, emphasizing illustration over decoration. “[Mariette Lydis’s art] represents the feminine outlook [and] gives us a facet of truth as seen by feminine eyes...I know of no artist--male or female--who can render the soul-- the most elusive of all human concepts--as convincingly as Mariette Lydis.”  Inspiration  Lydis drew inspiration from Koran decoration and decorated Korans herself. Much of her portraiture features young women, including the lithograph Les Paradis artificiels (16 works, 1955), the pencil-and-watercolor drawing Iris (1940), and the oil paintings Jeune femme de profil (1933), Portrait de jeune fille (1955), and Jovencita (1950). Lydis also based some of her works, including Les Criminelles, on prisons and condemned French women. She was influenced heavily by the Japanese artist Tsuguharu Foujita, her friend in Montmartre.  Printed illustrations  Lydis's first published illustration was in The Cloak of Dreams by Béla Balázs, a compilation of Chinese fairy tales. Additionally, five illustrated etchings by Lydis can be found in Le Petit Jésus by Joseph Delteil. Other writers that Mariette Lydis illustrated for include Pedro Miguel Obligado, Henry de Montherland, Paul Valéry, Pierre Louys, Paul Verlaine, and Jules Superveille. She illustrated Melancholía, one of Obligado's Argentinian books of poems (https://www.todocoleccion.net/libros-segunda-mano-poesia/melancolia-pedro- miguel-obligado-~x47933802).  Publicity  Mariette Lydis's work appeared in various newspaper and journal articles during her exhibitions, especially at the St. George's Galleries and the Leicester Galleries. These articles feature reproductions of her lithographic pencil drawings and watercolors.

James that continues Jane Austen's 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice with a murder mystery. Plot summary The novel begins in October, 1803, six years after the events in Pride and Prejudice which resulted in the marriage of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy and Miss Elizabeth Bennet. The Prologue and Book One introduce the main characters, summarize the histories of the Bennet and Darcy families, and introduce a murder. The remainder of the novel is about the mystery and its solution. Style The novel is a pastiche in the style of Jane Austen, as James acknowledges in her Author's Note. The book is divided into sections: Author's Note; Prologue; six Books; Epilogue. Elizabeth is largely absent in the central section. Unlike Pride and Prejudice, Darcy holds the narrative point of view, and therefore, the book often contains his inward reflections, absent in Austen's novel. Contents : Author's Note : Prologue : Book One: The Day Before the Ball : Book Two: The Body in the Woodland : Book Three: Police at Pemberley : Book Four: The Inquest : Book Five: The Trial : Book Six: Gracechurch Street George Wickham and his friend Captain Martin Denny, with Wickham's young wife Lydia (née Bennet), in a horse drawn chaise, are passing through a wooded area on the grounds of Pemberley in Derbyshire. Denny shouts to the driver to stop, and gets out. He runs into the woods, followed by Wickham, trying to stop him. Distraught, Lydia demands to be driven up to the house. The coachman, hearing shots, raises the alarm and Darcy and his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam, Viscount Hartlep, hurry to the wood minutes later. They discover Denny, a bloodstained corpse. Despite the shots, Denny had received the mortal blows from a blunt instrument. Wickham, still not sober, is beside him, and is heard to say that the death of Denny is his fault. Later in court, Wickham says that Denny ‘thought that I had been wrong to resign my commission without having a sound profession and a settled home for my wife. In addition he thought that my plan to leave Mrs Wickham at Pemberley to spend the night there and to attend the ball the next day was both inconsiderate and would be inconvenient for Mrs Darcy. I believe that it was his increasing impatience with my conduct that made my company intolerable to him, and that it was this reason that led him to stop the chaise and run into the woodland.’ The publican's wife at the inn from which the three travellers had set out said that she heard Denny say that ‘Mr Wickham was selfish and didn’t understand how women feel and that there had been deceit from start to finish.’ The coachman heard Denny say he wouldn't go along with Mr Wickham any more, and that Mr Wickham was now on his own. There is much about police and judicial procedures. Darcy, although he is a magistrate, stands aside in various ways from the investigation of a death on his land. In his defence Wickham tells the jury that he had come upon Denny lying dead, and fired with Denny's weapon at a figure he thought he saw retreating through the woods. Then, like a deus ex machina, a written deposition arrives from a sick man, William Bidwell, who has one week to live. He left his sickbed, seized a poker, and struck Denny, whom he took for the soldier who had interfered with his sister Louisa. After he knocked him down he saw him fall backwards, striking his head fatally on a stone. The deposition arrives after the jury has returned a verdict of guilty. Wickham receives a royal pardon. In the sixth and final section, the backstory is told, after we have been given the outcome of the trial. Wickham had fathered an illegitimate child by Louisa Bidwell. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who owed Wickham a favour from the Irish campaign, agreed to lend or give him £30 so that Mrs Younge, once a companion to Darcy's younger sister, could bring up the boy. She, however, is run over and killed outside the high court where Wickham has been tried, and it was expected that Louisa's married sister in Birmingham would adopt the child. Louisa, however, has only lately discovered that the father of her love child, Georgie, is in fact Wickham. It is arranged that Georgie be adopted by Mr and Mrs Robert Martin (brought in from Emma: Mrs Martin had been Harriet Smith before her marriage). They arrange his baptism, and give him the name of John. Louisa later marries Joseph Billings, butler at Highmarten, the home of Jane, née Bennet, and Charles Bingley, and intends that the boy will not in the future be found by Wickham, who will now emigrate to America with Lydia, financed once again by the benevolence of Darcy. Reviews Newspaper reviews are generally favourable, many enthusiastically so, with the New York Times foremost in the United States.

Levitsky tried to counterattack, but Marshall's unexpected winning move put his queen—his most valuable piece—on a square where it could be captured by three of Levitsky's pieces.

In its initial format it appeared just four times – in 1817, 1822, 1829 and 1836, under the editorial direction of Richard Gilbert. Another edition was actually advertised for 1838, Church Times: two-part article Shop-talk and mordant wit, by Christopher Currie & Glyn Paflin, describing the background to Crockford's Clerical Directory's first hundred editions, 6–13 December 2007 but no copies have in fact been found within the main academic libraries. The title was briefly revived by Thomas Bosworth & Company during the 1880s. Contents of the Clerical Guide The main alphabetical section of the directory included: *A list of benefices together with their populations, counties, dioceses and archdeaconries *Their incumbents with the year of his institution *Their values (up to the 1829 edition) in the Valor Ecclesiasticus or King's Books *The names of their patrons. *The 1836 edition additionally gave the income of the benefice during the year 1831, the available capacity or \\"church room\\" for the congregation, and the name of any impropriator. The preliminary pages included: *Current lists of bishops, members of cathedral chapter, and other dignitaries, showing the values of their first fruits *A section on the Doctors of Laws, the canonical specialists *A section on the Chapel Royal together with the king's preachers and chaplains *Sections on Sion College and Gresham College *Sections on the two English universities (Oxford and Cambridge) *Sections on the fellows and schoolmasters of Eton, Winchester, Westminster, Harrow, Manchester and St Paul's. The alphabetical list of benefices was also followed by an alphabetical list of the prelates, dignitaries and beneficed clergy of the Church of England (generally omitting the unbeneficed clergy). The directories concluded with lists of ecclesiastical patronage, giving the names of those benefices within the gift of the king and also those of the lord chancellor, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, the various archbishops and bishops, and the two universities. The publishers The 1817 edition stated that it was \\"printed for J. C. & F. Rivington, 62 St Paul's Churchyard, by R. & R. Gilbert, St John's Square, Clerkenwell\\". Richard Gilbert was a printer and an accountant with the SPCK. Although he appeared in the 1817 edition merely as the \\"printer\\" (alongside his brother Robert, who died the following year), he thereafter seems to have taken a more prominent role in its production. The 1822 edition was \\"corrected by Richard Gilbert\\", as though he had been engaged in putting right someone else's mistakes. He similarly wrote the prefaces for subsequent editions, and the 1836 edition still bore the names \\"Gilbert and Rivington, printers, St John's Square\\". Gilbert, an industrious compiler who was additionally very active in the religious life of Clerkenwell, also produced a pocket-sized Clergyman's Almanack in 1819 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: article on Richard Gilbert The Clerical Guide after 1836 The failure of the directory to appear after 1836 left open an opportunity for a rival publication. This was filled after 1841 by the Clergy List. After lying dormant for fifty years, the title Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory was briefly revived in 1886 by Thomas Bosworth & Company, 65 Great Russell Street. Once again the volume offered alternative listings of the clergy and the benefices, together with other \\"valuable information … from the office of the Ecclesiastical Commission.The Times newspaper, Thursday, Mar 18, 1886; pg. 12 However the relaunched title was very quickly acquired by Hamilton Adams of Paternoster Row, who in 1889 merged it with their other recent acquisition, the aforementioned Clergy List. In the issue for 1918/19 the Clergy List was merged in its turn with Crockford's Clerical Directory. Thereafter until the 1930s the latter title still continued to advertise on its preliminary pages that it \\"incorporated the Clergy List\\", together with the \\"Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory\\". A microfiche version of the 1829 directory was produced during the 1980s by the Society of Genealogists.

Biography  Maurice Achener was an Alsatian from Mulhouse, born September 17, 1881. The artist studied at a fine arts school in Strausberg (l'école des arts décoratifs de Strasbourg). He pursued further studies at the Arts Academy in Munich. There, he was a student of Ludwig von Löfftz and of Peter Halm, who introduced him to etching. In 1901 Émile Schneider and Georges Ritleng created a group of artists called the Alsatian Artist Society (in French: la Société des artistes alsaciens). This society counted among its members Maurice Achner, Daniel Schoen, Hansi, Alexandre Urbain, and N. Forsberg. Achner developed a friendship with André Engel, who was also from Mulhouse. His etchings were published in \\"la Revue alasacienne illustrée\\" (the Illustrated Alsatian Review), a periodical edited by Charles Spindler. He also became friends with the etcher and sculptor Maurice Bastide du Lude, at a studio situated at the Château du Lude near Orléans where they both worked. He created several small prints of his etchings which are still owned by the descendants of Bastide du Lude. Maurice Achener settled down in Paris in 1905. From 1907-1908, he worked with Jean-Paul Laurens. After becoming a French citizen in 1913, he participated in the First World War on the French coast under the family name of his wife, Émilie Patry. Patry, whose family was from Geneva, was the cousin of Mathilde Paravicini. Achner never stopped working and was highly recognized for his etching talents. After a long career as an artist, he died in Paris on April 19, 1963.  Works  His work was mainly of landscapes, created based on real life, as well as on numerous designs and paintings which he then used for his etchings. He eventually began working directly on the slab. Each engraving went through many \\"stages.\\" He would carefully research which paper would work best for his prints. He created his own inks. He was a precise and thorough printmaker, but his work was poetic and, although it is considered to be in the classical tradition, deeply personal. He often drew Paris but also covered the rest of France as he was commissioned to do so. He illustrated Alsace, the Alps, with a partiality to Notre-Dame-de-Bellecombe, Provence, the region of Poitiers, Carcassonne, Corsica and Brittany. He also visited Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. He spent time in Tunisia and in the United States, where his works were purchased by major collectors. He created nearly 550 prints, mainly with etching and drypoint. He also worked with oil paints and used pastel for some of his beautiful portraits, notably those of children in his family. Jean-Eugène Bersier described him in 1963 as such: \\"The printmakers Beaufrère, Mac Langhlan, Achener represent a diverse collection of honest and solid art.\\"  Illustrations  Théodolinde Waldner de Freundstein: The Alsatian legend by Georges Spetz (printed and sold by Lahure),1909.

Carton was born in Meaux. He received his medical education at the Ecole de Medecine de Paris.Ouédraogo, Arouna P. (2001). Food and the Purification of Society: Dr Paul Carton and Vegetarianism in Interwar France. The Society for the Social History of Medicine 14 (2): 223-245. In 1903, Carton suffered from tuberculosis. He became disillusioned with the medical establishment and took interest in alternative medicine and vegetarianism which he claimed helped recover his health. Carton was a vegetarian and promoted \\"naturist vegetarianism\\". Naturist vegetarianism was a dieting and health system that involved abstinence from drugs, meat, processed foods and alcohol. It embraced natural hygienic principles, gymnastics, hydrotherapy and prayer. Carton was influenced by Hippocrates and his conception of naturism was entirely opposed to nudism which he equated with moral degradation. He advocated asceticism in relation to clothing, drinking, eating and sex. Carton was a Catholic and held anti-materialist views. His ideas about naturist medicine were influenced by Catholicism and vitalist philosophy. His dietary principles became known as Cartonianism. There was a religious element to his dietary principles. He believed in original sin, hell and the Christian sacrifice was central to his medical worldview. He held the idea that health should be earned and that pain had a purifying role. Disease was the result of violation of physical and mental laws. Carton was opposed to the overfeeding of patients. He believed that strict control of eating would allow patients to be cured. He campaigned against the consumption of butter, meat and white bread. He operated a sanatorium at Brevannes, near Paris. The sanatorium had a laboratory for testing his dietary and hydropathic ideas. In 1921, he created the Societe Naturiste Francaise' (French Naturist Society) and in 1922 the journal La Revue Naturiste (The Naturist Review). Selected publications *La Tuberculose par arthritisme.

After her marriage in 1862 to Rabbi L. Kleeberg, she lived in Rhenish Prussia, where she moved in a circle of literary men, chief among them Emil Rittershaus. In 1866 Minna Kleeberg emigrated to the United States, living until 1877 in Louisville, Kentucky, where her husband had been elected rabbi of a congregation, and removing thence to New Haven. Works Most of her poems were published in Stein's Freitag-Abend at Frankfurt. In 1865 her poem \\"Ein Lied vom Salz\\" (A lyric about salt), a plea for the removal of the tax on salt in Prussia, spread her reputation. She had an abiding interest in public and patriotic questions: The Franco-Prussian War, the Fifteenth Amendment, Friedrich Hecker, the emancipation of women, and the cause of liberty and democracy were among her themes. Jewish national and religious feelings were equally a source of inspiration. The aspersions cast upon Jews by Wagner and Billroth she repelled with indignant vigor. Her children and the joys and sorrows of domestic life were also notable themes of her verse. In the United States, she was a frequent contributor to Das New-Yorker Belletristische Journal.

The Yemeni revolution was a series of major protests, political tensions, and armed clashes taking place in Yemen, which began in January 2011 and were influenced by concurrent protests in the region. Hundreds of protesters, members of armed groups, army soldiers and security personnel were killed, and many more injured, in the largest protests to take place in the South Arabian country for decades. In early 2012, it was clear President Ali Abdullah Saleh's time in power was drawing to a close. Saleh made several trips abroad during this period as unrest and anger against his regime continued at home, as did shows of support for him. In an uncontested election in which Saleh was not on the ballot, Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Al-Hadi stood for and was elected to the presidency. His swearing in days later marked the official end of the Saleh administration, amid suggestions Saleh could seek exile in Oman or Ethiopia. Timeline September–December 2011 January 2012 =1 January= Clashes between loyalists of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in the Yemen Army Republican Guard and opposition forces of the Alliance of Yemeni Tribes under Sadiq al- Ahmar left one bystander dead in the capital of Sana'a and two residents dead in the region of el-Fardha Nehem. The fighting was reportedly stopped when Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansur al-Hadi, nominally acting with the powers of the presidency under a Gulf Co-operation Council agreement inked in November 2011, personally intervened to mediate between the government and opposition. The opposition rallied in the streets and accused Saleh of attempting to sabotage the GCC peace deal ahead of elections scheduled for February. Activists reiterated their demand that Saleh face trial instead of enjoying the immunity granted by the GCC initiative. =8 January= The cabinet approved a law granting immunity to President Saleh. The action forwarded the law to the legislature for its approval. =12 January= Shi'a rebels in the north clashed with Salafi Islamist militants, leaving at least four Salafis dead. =13 January= South Yemen separatists traded fire with soldiers at a festival commemorating the beginning of the Yemeni Civil War some 26 years earlier. Four civilians were killed and two soldiers were injured, according to witnesses and officials. At least 10 were wounded by security forces. =16 January= Rada' District in central-west Yemen was allegedly captured by militants linked to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Some 150 inmates were reportedly set free from a prison there. Several opposition figures accused the Yemeni government of deliberately allowing Rada' to fall in a bid to demonstrate that Yemen was too unstable for a political transition to occur. =17 January= Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi said the presidential election scheduled for February could be delayed due to security concerns. =21 January= The Assembly of Representatives of Yemen approved the immunity law. It also nominated Vice President Hadi as its candidate for the upcoming presidential election. Alistair Burt, the United Kingdom's Middle East minister, lauded Hadi's nomination, saying an interim Hadi presidency would provide a credible political transition for the country heading into free and fair elections in 2014. =22 January= President Saleh departed abruptly for Oman en route to the United States for medical treatment, government officials said. In a statement, Saleh asked the Yemeni people to forgive him for \\"any shortcomings\\" and vowed to return. Thousands of Yemenis protested in Sana'a against the immunity law, chanting for Saleh's trial and execution over his role in the crackdown. Several hundred Yemeni soldiers and airmen took over Sana'a International Airport to demand the removal of Yemeni Air Force chief Mohammad Saleh al-Ahmar, President Saleh's half-brother, sparking a confrontation with loyalist security forces. Major General Ahmed Ali al-Ashwal, the military's chief of staff, was reportedly forced to intervene. At least one protester was arrested, the Yemen Post indicated. =23 January= The Air Force strike continued in Sana'a, with protesters continuing to demand General Mohammad Saleh al-Ahmar's removal. =24 January= Reuters reported that Saleh sought asylum in Oman and that the Omani government was reluctant to accommodate him for fear of damaging bilateral ties with Yemen in the future if popular pressure for the president to be tried for his role in the government crackdown continued. In Yemen, the strike entered its third day, with airmen blocking main roads in Sana'a and protesters thronging outside Hadi's residence. =26 January= In overnight fighting in Saada Governorate, Salafi militants allegedly attacked Houthi rebels in control of the region, leaving at least 22 dead. Protesters continuing to demand General Mohammed Saleh al-Ahmar be sacked claimed two Air Force officers were abducted by pro-Saleh gunmen in Hudaiydah for supporting the strike. =29 January= Saleh arrived in the United States for treatment. In a statement, the U.S. government claimed it granted him a visa only for medical reasons. The same day, Republican Guard units fired on protesting soldiers, including Republican Guardsmen calling for the replacement of superior officers, in Sana'a. No casualties were reported. =31 January= Information Minister Ali al- Amrani escaped an apparent assassination attempt unhurt after unidentified gunmen riddled his car with bullets as he left a Cabinet meeting in Sana'a. February 2012 =10 February= Major protests took place across Yemen, with tens of thousands rallying to ask Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansour al-Hadi to \\"save the country\\" as Yemenis prepared for a 21 February presidential election in which Hadi would be the only candidate on the ballot. The Associated Press noted that the demonstrations marked a change in tone for the Yemeni street, which previously appeared to largely oppose the Gulf Co- operation Council's peace plan. In Ta'izz, protesters marked the one-year anniversary of the uprising with the lighting of a \\"revolution torch\\" on Jamal Street, the cradle of the protests, and fireworks late into the night. =11 February= Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar, head of the Hashid and the Alliance of Yemeni Tribes, said he would participate in the upcoming presidential election in order to \\"forget about Ali Abdullah Saleh\\", Yemen's outgoing president. He encouraged his followers to vote as well. Military defectors marched from Change Square to near Hadi's residence to call for reform. As a concession, the government provided buses to send the defectors to Sana'a's \\"Officers' Club\\" to collect their first paychecks in months, Al Jazeera reported. A carnival parade arranged by pro-election activists and an opera celebrating Yemeni unification continued festivities marking the uprising's one-year anniversary in Ta'izz. A smaller group of protesters set up a stage to denounce the impending single-candidate election of Hadi as president, calling for a boycott of the polls. =13 February= South Yemen separatists reportedly set fire to a protest camp in Aden, the south's principal port city, to protest the upcoming 21 February election supported by many protesters wishing to see Saleh removed from power. =14 February= A bomb went off at a polling site being set up in Aden, killing the apparent separatist purportedly trying to plant it inside a voting booth, according to a government official. The official said the Southern Movement was trying to disrupt the election. =16 February= A labor strike crippled Yemen's petroleum output as workers and staff at the state oil company Petromasila shut down production at the Masila oilfield, the country's largest. Strikers complained of \\"corruption\\" at the Oil Ministry and voiced anger over the departure of the multinational corporation Canadian Nexen, which it said owed them money from its tenure as Petromasila's operator. =17 February= Striking Petromasila workers agreed to return to work, according to a Dow Jones source. =18 February= McClatchy Newspapers reported that many residents of Aden intended to heed the Southern Movement's call for an election boycott. At least one party leader decried the \\"occupation\\" of former South Yemen by troops loyal to Sana'a, despite Hadi being a southerner himself. =21 February - Election Day= The presidential election was held, with hundreds of thousands of Yemenis going to the polls to vote for Hadi, the only candidate on the ballot. Some unofficial estimates put turnout at around 80 percent. The United States and other countries issued statements congratulating the Yemeni people and voicing support for the single-candidate election. Huge rallies reportedly erupted across the country as many Yemenis celebrated President Ali Abdullah Saleh's coming departure from power and the election of a new leader. However, in Yemen's south, nine people were reportedly killed when police clashed with anti-government protesters calling for a boycott, and voting was disrupted when gunmen stormed polling places, stealing and destroying a number of ballot boxes, according to local residents in Lahej Governorate. Meanwhile, exports from the Masila oilfield reportedly resumed after the one-day strike of the previous week. =22 February= Saleh departed from Logan International Airport in Boston en route to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. =24 February= Late in the evening, Saleh arrived in Sana'a from Addis Ababa, intending to attend the inauguration of President-elect Hadi. =25 February= Hadi took the constitutional oath of office as Yemen's president. In a speech, he vowed to address the problems of internal displacement and rampant poverty in Yemen. =27 February= President Hadi was formally inaugurated in a ceremony in Sana'a. Saleh, the former president, accompanied Hadi and handed him a folded flag of Yemen as a symbol of the passage of power. Saleh said he would remain as head of the General People's Congress, Yemen's ruling party, and a number of activists demonstrated outside Hadi's residence calling for a restructuring of the military to remove Saleh's loyalists and relatives from positions of power. The Joint Meeting Parties boycotted the ceremony, calling Hadi's election a \\"heresy\\". Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that Saleh and his family were preparing to go into exile in Ethiopia.

Preservation Action was created in 1974 to serve as the national grassroots lobby for historic preservation. The organization seeks to make historic preservation a national priority by advocating to all branches of the federal government for sound preservation policy and programs through a grassroots constituency of hundreds of members from throughout the United States. Preservation Action provides information and training, and encourages direct contact with elected representatives, with National Historic Preservation Advocacy Week being the highlight of advocacy and outreach efforts each year. Preservation Action's offices are in the Christian Heurich Mansion in Washington, D.C., though it has representatives across the country. History Preservation Action came about after the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Early in the 1970s, preservation leaders realized that achieving their goals required substantial increases in federal support. This included especially the need for appropriations for federal-state preservation programs, changes in laws and regulations, and an understanding of the U.S. Congress and the federal government of the benefits of historic preservation. Preservation Action proved instrumental in the passage of various laws and amendments, including the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Following the success of these early advocacy efforts, the focus shifted slightly to helping local organizations advocate for preservation in their own communities and states as well as continuing to lobby Congress for increased funding for federal preservation projects and agencies. The success of Preservation Action at the federal level, inspired the establishment of enhanced preservation lobbying efforts at the state level. Such was the case with the establishment of Connecticut Preservation Action in 1979, to overturn a newly enacted law that would have crippled the state's National Register program. In the 1980s preservationists were increasingly interested in the 'business' of preservation'. Initiatives like the Main Street Program, established by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1980, helped to focus efforts to improve historic downtown areas and commercial districts throughout the United States. Into this milieu came Preservation Action, that along with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, served as an important advocate for historic preservation at the federal level. With improved incentives for historic preservation in the form of tax credits and other programs, the focus of urban projects shifted dramatically from demolition to rehabilitation. Nellie Longsworth, one-time President of Preservation Action explained: \\"All kinds of things have been tried to stop the deterioration of downtowns. The first program that ever really worked was the investment tax credit.\\" With the unprecedented growth in historic preservation activities, Preservation Action cemented its role as a rallying point for the private historic preservation community at the national level, along with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Sources credit this coming together of forces in support of historic preservation, and Longsworth especially. Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr., wrote \\"Never before or since have we seen preservation activities carried out so diligently by so many with such excellent results.\\" In more recent decades, federal programs such as Save America's Treasures and Preserve America have brought resources to the front lines of where preservation work is being done in communities. These same programs, despite their effectiveness, were threatened by cutbacks in funding in the present fiscal environment. Preservation Action has always and continues to play an important role in advocating for these federal programs to support historic preservation at the state and local level. In 2015, Preservation Action started to conduct monthly calls with statewide organizations to better connect states to the legislative efforts happening at the federal level, as well as, connecting Preservation Action the legislative efforts happening at the state and local level. In 2016, prior to the November Congressional elections, Preservation Action conducted a Federal Candidate Historic Preservation Survey. Preservation Action conducted a nationwide historic preservation survey of all candidates running for the U.S House and U.S Senate. The survey gauged candidates on their support of a number of issues important to preservationists, like the Historic Preservation Fund and Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit program. Current activities Preservation Action has several existing programs and activities to advance the cause of historic preservation today. A few of these follow. Legislative Update The Legislative Update is an email sent out regularly on a weekly basis to Preservation Action members. Updates on spending bills and legislation affecting preservation are included each week. Special announcements are made and upcoming events are highlighted. National Historic Preservation Advocacy Week This event, usually held in March of each year, provides an opportunity for representatives from participating states to come and lobby their members of Congress. The first day provides a general overview of major issues affecting preservation. The second day is filled with Capitol Hill visits. Leadership Former Congressman Russ Carnahan is President of Preservation Action. He is responsible for the leadership of the organization, and furthering the member- driven legislative agenda in Congress through direct lobbying and/or through an active membership and national partners. He is supported by a staff in the preparation of educational materials and weekly legislative updates. The Board of Directors plays an active role in the operation of Preservation Action. An executive Committee with a Chair, several Vice Chairs, Secretary, and Treasurer assists in managing the organization. Membership To fulfill its mission, and to protect our nation's preservation program, Preservation Action relies on the support of preservation advocates across the country. Now more than ever, with threats not only to preservation funding but to preservation policy, Preservation Action provides a strong, unified, and educated voice.

Although this iteration portrayed Spencer as having red spiky hair, sunglasses and green military fatigues, the packaging artwork for the North American version shows a different portrayal in which his dark red hair is much lighter and combed to the side, and a futuristic red and blue suit replaces his military uniform.Bionic Commando (NES) North American box art The European version had an even further sci-fi inspired outfit, with a plain green suit with massive yellow boots and gloves, and short blonde hair.Bionic Commando (NES) European box art Though the artwork depicted a much different character, the sprites used for Spencer in-game remained the same. In the Game Boy version of Bionic Commando, the spelling of Spencer's first name was changed from \\"Ladd\\" to \\"Rad\\". Spencer's design in the Game Boy version uses futuristic cues and combine them with the prior design from the NES. The result was that of an armored Rad Spencer with a red undersuit and dark red hair.Bionic Commando (Game Boy) North American box art Each of these iterations depicted Spencer as a playful, cynical character. Throughout all of these early iterations, Spencer is depicted as having a detachable grappling device, and not a full bionic limb which would be seen in later games. The protagonist, Nathan Spencer, received a slight redesign for Rearmed 2 (left) from his original Rearmed design (right). The change was well received by critics. Bionic Commando Rearmed, a remake of the NES game, reused his military-esque appearance with minor visual upgrades by concept artist Shinkiro. In redesigning Spencer for Rearmed, GRIN cited the characters Iceman from the movie Top Gun and Marty McFly from the Back to the Future series as visual influences for his new appearance. Notable changes include his characteristic spiky hair being reduced to a crew cut in this version, as well as his Bionic Arm now firmly established to be on his left side and having been redesigned to look more mechanical and menacing. The next chronological title in the series Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, would again alter Spencer's appearance slightly. The character was given a different uniform, his hair was streaked back, and he was given a mustache to resemble an older form of the original NES design. His once clean, silver Bionic Arm is now a darker, bulker, and grittier version of the original as seen in Rearmed. The events of this game would lead to multiple changes in both his appearance and personality later in the series. His most drastic change is arguably his current appearance, which was set forth in the 2009 3D action game. Nathan is missing his trademark sunglasses and his usual red hair is now reprogrammed as brown tied in dreadlocks, although the player can unlock the Rearmed incarnation as a replacement for this game's facelift. In the official webcomic Bionic Commando: Chain of Command, Spencer is shown being given this drastic appearance after having spent five solitary years in prison. The character is voiced by Faith No More singer Mike Patton, and is depicted as an ex-convict, framed for crimes involving his bionic abilities. The resulting character is much more bitter than his previous iterations, often angry and prone to using profanity. This appearance was also used in Capcom's fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, except now he is voiced by Dameon Clarke in English and Takaya Kuroda in Japanese. Spencer reappears as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite. Naming The character's full name was first given as in the manual for the Famicom version of Top Secret without any romanized spelling.Top Secret: Hitler no Fukkatsu Instruction Manual, p. 4. Only the first name is mentioned in the English-language NES version of Bionic Commando, where it was rendered as \\"Ladd\\" instead of the now conventional \\"Rad\\".Bionic Commando (Ending). Ladd Spencer: This is Ladd, our mission accomplished. The full name and spelling of \\"Rad Spencer\\" would be used for the first time in the English localization of the Game Boy version. In Bionic Commando Rearmed, the character's name was changed to \\"Nathan Spencer\\", with \\"Rad\\" now being his nickname (which is established to be derived from Research & Development). This change would carry over to the 2009 sequel and Spencer's appearance in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Reception The character has received mixed reactions from critics over the years. In 2012, Game Informer staff named Spencer as one of their \\"Ten Video Game Characters We Hate Playing As\\". The staff cited his frailty to environmental hazards in comparison to the perception given to the player of making him superhero- esque. Games Radar's Brett Elston had similar views in regards to the 2009 re- imaging of Spencer. While he conceded that some changes were welcome he criticized the character's long hair and \\"gruff M-rated voicover\\". He later praised his new arm, saying: \\"Sure is cooler than the other, less sucky version\\". However, the GamesRadar's staff included the fact that his arm is his wife in the category \\"Stupidest plot twist, possibly ever\\" at \\"The Anti- Awards 2009\\". Jesse Schedeen of IGN named Spencer second in their top 15 video game commandos. Schedeen jokingly stated that Spencer's inability to jump in earlier games was simply that \\"he just doesn't see the need when his bionic arm can do all the commando-ing for him.\\" In 2013, Complex ranked Nathan Spencer at number 25 on the list of the greatest soldiers in video games. Joystick Division ranked Fire Emblems Marth third in its article about what Brawl characters should be replaced, citing Rad as his substitute. Game Informer chose him as one of the 20 Capcom characters they would like to see in a rumored crossover fighting game Namco Vs Capcom, his Namco side equivalent being Monkey from Enslaved: Odyssey to the West since both of them are \\"solitary, brooding protagonists [and] use their impressive agility to scamper around environments.\\" GamesRadar included him in the 2013 list of \\"The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years\\" because of his ability of swinging around instead of jumping.

He realized at least 130 drawings and watercolours, most of them in Germany, France and Italy.  Biography  Born in a Norfolk noble family,The Dugmore of Swaffham family archives are filed by the UK National Archives he had a deep classical education. Renowned for his taste in arts, he moved to London to seek his fame and fortune at the Royal Court, where he met his ‘patron’, William Charles Keppel (1772-1849), 4th Earl of Albermarle. Dugmore was probably responsible for Keppel children's education. The Grand Tour In 1820, Dugmore accompanied in the Grand Tour a son of Charles Keppel, perhaps George Thomas (1799-1891), later 6th Earl of Albermarle, Viscount of Bury and Baron of Ashford, who made a brilliant military career (started at Waterloo) as well as was a memorialist, a distinguished collector and a member of the English Society of Antiquaires. They moved from Scotland to Western Bohemia, France, Switzerland and Italy. In around 20 months, Dugmore fixed on paper everything that surprised him, mostly mountains, lakes, rivers and other natural features. Sometimes he sketched interesting architecture or historical places, for instance the cell in the Great St. Bernard Hospice where Napoleon slept during his crossing of the Alps (1800) or the Clermont Castle, former residence of Blaise Pascal. Works Lady Hutton, Dugmore's daughter-in-law, mentioned the existence of many albums filled by 130 c. drawings. 65 drawings are recorded in detail in Lady Hutton's last will. Among them, 47 were recently discovered by Guy Peppiat and offered on sale at an English auction house.Jeremy Highsmith, Tre importanti nuclei di disegni, in Quadri e Sculture, VIII, 2001, 37, p. 92 Another one is filed in Sabin Galleries archives, London. These works are usually made on a slightly cream paper, 260x200 mm., by pencil, pen and black ink.The 47 mentioned works are listed in Giacomo Pintus, Entries 117-118, in Idea y Sentimiento. Itinerarios por el dibujo de Rafael a Cézanne, Barcelona, 2007, pp. 299-301. Value Dugmore's urban landscapes are visual witnesses of the shape of many main and minor European cities, among them Paris, Vichy, Clermont-Ferrand, Lyon, Schandau, Tivoli, Susa, Florence and Siena. Dugmore is considered relevant for his ability in feeling and amplifying the aesthetics which he was meeting. For instance, his ‘German’ drawings are very linear and pure; on the opposite side his ‘French’ drawings are ‘touched’ by pencil and brush in a way that seems largely to anticipate the impressionist idea of the light. Museums Three works by Dugmore are included in the Progetto Linea, a large private project for increasing the paper cabinets in Italian public museums of art.

In United States law, a false statement of fact will not be exempt from some civil or criminal penalty, if a law has imposed one. This exception has evolved over time from a series of Supreme Court cases that dealt with issues such as libel, slander, and statutes which barred fraudulent solicitation of charitable donations. A major limiting factor to this concrete First Amendment exception are statements made against public figures. In New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), the Court strongly suggested that even \\"deliberate lies\\" could not be punished if made against the government. Since that decision, many cases that have dealt with this rule have struggled to define the line of who actually is a 'public figure'. The Supreme Court has also extended this doctrine to non- political figures who are simply famous or well known in the media. Overview of the legal rule Theoretical basis for exception The United States Supreme Court first articulated the basis for excluding false statements of fact from First Amendment protection in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974). In that case, a monthly newspaper was sued by a policeman's attorney. The newspaper \\"contained serious inaccuracies\\" about the attorney; namely, that he was supporting the police system as a goal to entrench a Communist conspiracy in the United States. They held that a civil jury award against the newspaper was constitutional because \\"there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact\\". Justice Powell, in writing the decision of the Court reasoned that false statements do not \\"advance society's interest in 'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate'\\". Even though he conceded that some false statements were inevitable, that did not mean that a system of liability meant to deter such behavior was impermissible. Society had some interest in ensuring that debate covered truthful matters, as a key element of public participation in a democracy. Basic substantive rule The legal rule itself – how to apply this exception – is complicated, as it is often dependent on who said the statement and which actor it was directed towards. The analysis is thus different if the government or a public figure is the target of the false statement (where the speech may get more protection) than a private individual who is being attacked over a matter of their private life. Thus, a key starting point in the analysis will discuss the 'manner' and 'context' in which the statements were made. Professor Eugene Volokh of UCLA Law characterizes this context analysis as divided into five different areas. First, false statements of fact can lead to civil liability if they are \\"said with a sufficiently culpable mental state\\". This possibly includes conscious lies about military service. The second category is a subset of the first: knowingly false statements (deliberate lies). This includes things like libel and slander. These sorts of statements are specifically punishable because they contain malice. A third category are \\"negligently\\" false statements, which may \\"lead to [some] liability\\". A fourth included set includes statements that only have a \\"provable false factual connotation\\" – that is, implicit statements of fact. The example Volokh uses is the statement that \\"Joe deserves to die\\" which in the context of a murder could be made to be a factual statement. The fifth category is one that is not as firmly set by precedent: false statements, even deliberate lies, against the government may be protected. While some \\"seditious libel\\" may be able to be punished, political statements are likely protected. Remedies Punitive damages are sometimes available against an individual who made a public false statement of fact. Such damages are contingent on the plaintiff demonstrating \\"actual malice\\" (intent to do harm) in the lawsuit. Criminal liability, although uncommon, can be made although they are usually subject to the same limitations imposed on civil suits in terms of elements to be proven.Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64 (1964). Categories of analysis Public officials/public concern False statements that are on matters of public concern and that defame public figures are unprotected if either the speaker has knowledge that his statements are false, there is a negligence in the statement, or there is \\"actual malice\\" to inflict harm. The \\"actual malice\\" test comes from the Supreme Court's decision New York Times v. Sullivan (1964). That case concerned an allegation of libel by L.B. Sullivan, a supervisor of the Montgomery, Alabama police department. Sullivan argued that a full-page advertisement in the New York Times incorrectly asserted that his police department let civil rights violations against blacks occur. The Court held that even if the advertisement was incorrect, the fact that there was no intent to harm Sullivan by the newspaper (\\"actual malice\\") meant that the lawsuit could not proceed. This specific standard of mens rea is specifically to be used in cases where such speech comments on a matter of public concern. The basis for this ruling was the Court's fear that \\"a rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions\\" would lead to \\"self-censorship\\".New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 279 (1964). This determination altered the theory of the 'false statements' free speech exception. Even if a false statement generally would be harmful for public discourse, the Court quoted John Stuart Mill in arguing a false statement in this context would bring \\"the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error\\".New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 280 (1964). =Definition of public figures= The Supreme Court has struggled to define who exactly is a public figure, but over fifty years of cases, a framework has become defined. The first grouping of public figures are government officials. The test of which government figures was articulated in the Court's ruling in Rosenblatt v. Baer (1966). In Rosenblatt, the Court said that government positions subject to this rule were those in which the \\"public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds it, beyond the general public interest in the qualifications and performance of all government employees\\". Additionally, a court must question whether the \\"employee's position is one which would involve public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it\\". Along with government officials, the Supreme Court held in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974) that people who \\"have assumed an influential role in ordering society\\" are considered public figures. This is the same for people who have \\"achieved...pervasive fame or notoriety\\" or who have \\"voluntarily injected themselves or been drawn into a particular public controversy\\".Time, Inc. v. Firestone, 424 U.S. 448 (1976). This has even been held to include Jerry Falwell, a major religious figure in the United States.Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46. =Issues \\"of public concern\\"= The leading case on what an issue \\"of public concern\\" is Dun & Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders (1985). In Dun & Bradstreet, the Supreme Court considered whether a credit reporting service which distributed fliers to their only five subscribers qualified as an action of \\"public concern\\". As it was \\"hardly and unlikely to be deterred by incidental state regulation\\", the Court concluded it did not qualify. This decision did not provide strong guidance on the issue. This vague area of law in regards to false statements of fact can lead to a variety of arguments over what is relevant or has public importance.Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265 (1971). Private individuals/public concern In Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), the Supreme Court considered an article published in a magazine published by the John Birch Society. The article contained inaccuracies about a private individual, in this case the attorney for a policeman. The Court held that because plaintiff Gertz had not \\"thrust himself into the vortex of this public issue\\", the newspaper could not be freed from liability of their false statements. That standard of being put into the public spotlight was used in Snyder v. Phelps (2010), which permitted false statements about a dead Marine because those comments were in the midst of a public debate about war.Snyder v. Phelps (2010). In cases which fall into this category, \\"actual malice\\" is the standard for a plaintiff to gain compensation at a trial. Private individuals/private concern The most ambiguous area of analysis for false statements of fact are cases that involve private individuals and speech about a private concern. Most likely, a standard of strict liability would attach to speech under this section. Broadly speaking, this category includes speech that doesn't fit the limits of the \\"false statements of fact\\" free speech exception, meaning that such speech is not protected.

Living a stationary life attached to substrate in marine and brackish environments, they formed shells of an aragonite composition with a low amount of magnesium calcite. The family was named by King in 1850. At least one genus in the family, Hoernesia, has a notably twisted commissure join. Morphology Generally the family consists of species with elongate shells with notably unequal valves. Some of the genera have lost the small anterior auricle but all lack a byssal notch. The shell structuring consists of a regular prismatic calcitic outer layer and an interior layering which is nacreous. The valve surfaces show multiple pits where the valve ligaments were attached. The valve dentition generally consisted of a series of short, transverse teeth along the anterior edge and a few more elongated teeth along the sides. Shells of the included genera range from having radial sculpturing to not having any radial sculpture. Several of the species have an early growth period in which the valve ligament is anchored in a single pit in the shell. When the species size exceeded approximately the ligament attachment would develop to encompass two or more pits. One possible species of Bakevelliid from the early Triassic of Utah is tentatively included in the genus Bakevellia but is noted for having an adult shell with only one ligament attachment pit, contrary to the normal state of the rest of the family.

It extends north from Nyhavn at the Nyhavn Bridge, continuing Holberggade, passes Sankt Annæ Plads after just one block, and continues straight until it reaches West India Warehouse where it makes a sharp left turn which connects it to Amaliegade, its parallel street, at the rear of the Design Museum. The east side of the street is lined by a series of 18th century warehouses whose other sides face the Larsens Plads waterfront, which was a major hub for emigration to America. History Origins King Christian VI's Custom House in 1754 C. F. Sørensen in circa 1845. The wall towards Amalienborg seen to the right. The street traces its history back to Axel Ulstrup's New Copenhagen masterplan which recommended a regulation of the coastline north of the city, between Bremerholm and the Custom House which had been built in 1630. The name originally only referred to the southernmost section of the street while the section north of Sankt Annæ Plads was merely an embankment across the marshy terrain along the coast. From about 1708 the area was filled and in 1719 the street was paved and became known as Ny Toldbodgade (English: New Custom House Street), a name it kept until 1940. It was described as the \\"most regular and longest street in the city\\". The street led to King Christian VI's new custom house which was completed in 1734 to the design of Johan Cornelius Krieger. Place of contrasts When Frederiksstaden was founded in 1750, Ny Toldbodgade came to mark the boundary between the busy life in the port and the elegant new residential district with its Rococo mansions. In 1755, due to the risk of fires, it was decided to relocate the lumberyards which had previously dominated the area along the water to Greenland, an undeveloped site adjacent to Nyboder, but the quay remained a very active part of the port. In the 1780s a row of warehouses was built along the east side of the street, where the lumberyards had once been, creating something of a barrier between the life of the port and that of Frederiksstaden. Shanty housing and America boats P. Klæstrup Up through the 19th century the street continued to be a place of contrasts as Frederiksstaden remained the most fashionable neighbourhood for Copenhagen's elite while the area along the street was settled by people who had been left homeless by the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 and the British Bombardment of 1807. They lived in intermistic, one- storey sheds which existed up until 1869 when the custom house was expanded. An America boat at 8 Toldbodgade/Larsens Place In 1802, the site was acquired by a wealthy ship owner, Lars Larsen, who established a ship and lumber yard in the grounds which became known as Larsen's Place after its founder. Later in the century Larsen's Place became a hub for the America steamers which transported thousands of emigrants from all of Scandinavia to New York in search of a better future. Buildings The most characteristic buildings along the street are the old warehouses along its east side. They were all designed by Caspar Frederik Harsdorff and include the Double Warehouse, the Blue Warehouse and West India Warehouse. Sculptory One of the columns at Amalie Garden relief from the pediment of King Christian VI's Custom House A relief from the pediment of King Christian VI's Custom House was saved when the building was demolished in 1891. It has now been installed on a wall, where it now serves as a point de vue at the north end of Toldbodgade, at the point where the street bends to join Amaliegade. It depicts the king flanked by Neptune and Mercury, the Roman Gods of seafaring and trade, holding a double edged trident and Caduceus respectively. At the Amalie Garden stand two modern columns which flank the so-called Amalienborg Axis which bisects both Amalienborg Palace and Garden, offering views across the harbour to Copenhagen Opera House on one side and views across the central plaza of the palace to the Marble Church on the other. The columns were designed by Italian sculptor Arnaldo Pomodoro and installed in 1984 as part of the Amalie Garden. Toldbodgade today Toldbodgade is centrally located between some of Copenhagen's most popular visitor attractions, including Nyhavn to the south, Amalienborg Palace and the design museum to the west and the Citadel and Langelinie with The Little Mermaid, although most pedestrians opt for the waterfront promenade along Larsens Plads. The old warehouses have been converted for other uses. The West India Warehouses now house the Royal Cast Collection, part of the National Gallery, as well as an exhibition of costumes from the Royal Danish Theatre, while the Double Warehouse has become the Copenhagen Admiral Hotel.

The dragon boundary marks are cast iron statues of dragons on metal or stone plinths that mark the boundaries of the City of London. The dragons are painted silver, with details of their wings and tongue picked out in red. The dragon stands on one rear leg, the other lifted against a shield, with the right foreleg raised and the left foreleg holding a shield which bears the City of London's coat of arms, painted in red and white. This stance is the equivalent of the rampant heraldic attitude of the supporters of the City's arms. Design The design is based on two large dragon sculptures, high, which were mounted above the entrance to the Coal Exchange on Lower Thames Street, designed by the City Architect, J. B. Bunning, and made by the London founder Dewer in 1849. The dragons were preserved when the Coal Exchange was demolished in 1962–3. The two original statues were re-erected on high plinths of Portland stone at the western boundary of the City, by Temple Gardens on Victoria Embankment, in October 1963. The Corporation of London's Streets Committee selected the statues as the model for boundary markers for the city in 1964, in preference to the fiercer dragon by C. B.

Sánchez Magallanes is a small fishing town and port located in the far northwest of the state of Tabasco, Mexico in the municipality of Cárdenas. It is named after a leader in the French Intervention in Mexico, Coronel Andrés Sánchez Magallanes. The town is located on small peninsula which is between the Gulf of Mexico and a lagoon called Del Carmen, which the port faces. Fishing is the main economic activity here, especially the production of oysters, although there is tourism and oil production as well. The last has been problematic for fishing and tourism due to pollution. The most serious environmental problem is the erosion of the area’s fragile beaches, especially the thin strips of land between the Gulf and the lagoons. The town View of main plaza in center of town Located in the far northwest of the municipality of Cárdenas 93 km from the municipal seat, the full name of the town is Coronel Andrés Sánchez Magallanes. It has an altitude of ten meters above sea level. The town is one of the municipality’s 25 “regional centers of social and economic development.” Sánchez Magallanes has 7,827 people. The average schooling is only four years, with only 992 over the age of 15 with education beyond middle school. There are 441 people who are illiterate. There are 1,777 residences in the community, almost all of which are independent houses. Two hundred have packed earth floors and 456 consist of only one room. The parish is named after Saint Anne, the grandmother of Jesus and established in 1959 by the Diocese of Tabasco . The patron saint is honored from the 24th to 26 July with religious activities as well as sporting and cultural events, a beauty pageant and exhibition of regional products. An Oyster Fair is held in conjunction with the other festivities. The town has a Virgin Mary statue called “Madre Patria” (Mother of Country) because at her feet is a serpent being devoured, similar to that of the national seal. It was chosen to receive a thirteen-meter sculpture of the Virgin Mary donated by the town of Benito Juárez. The sculpture is made of black volcanic stone and part of a series of seven Virgin Mary statues that define the “Chinandega Route” from Tenosique to Sánchez Magallanes. According to scattered archeological evidence, the area was occupied at least as far back as the Mayan era. According to Bernal Díaz del Castillo, Juan de Grijalva,Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, and Hernán Cortés passed an indigenous settlement here, then called Ayagualulco or Agualulco. Sometime after Spanish domination, the town became known as Barra de Santa Ana. According to oral tradition, there are two reasons why the Spanish community was called Barra de Santa Anna. The first states that during the 19th century, a devout woman from the city of Campeche donated a statue of Saint Anne to the community. The second states that a shipwrecked man on the point of drowning here pleaded to the saint to save him and by miracle he survived. He then donated an image of Saint Anne to the fishermen who saved him. The current name was declared in 1909 by state Governor Abraham Bandala in honor of Coronel Andrés Sánchez Magallanes, who fought against the French in the 19th century. The community was declared a town and port in 1964 by Governor Carlos Alberto Madrazo Becerra . Geography and environment Vegetation on Gulf side of peninsula Wetlands just outside town Sánchez Magallanes is located on a small peninsula which has the Gulf of Mexico on its north side and the Del Carmen Lagoon to its south. This strip of land is still called the Barra de Santa Anna. On the west it is attached to the mainland through a swampy area. The peninsula comes to a point on the east. The main road through the town comes to this point, which then connects to a bridge over a gap that connects the lagoon to the Gulf. The Del Carmen Lagoon is the inland body of water to which the center of town faces. It is one of several small lagoons which are separated only by narrow strips of land from the Gulf of Mexico. This water has tones of blue and green. Boats are available to rent for tours of the body of water or to visit nearby beaches. Rod and reel fishing is permitted. El Pajaral is a small island located near the town, which is a natural refuge for thousands of birds. It is about twenty minutes by boat to reach. Like the rest of Tabasco, the town has a most hot and very wet climate. The area’s climate is heavily affected by cold fronts from the north in the winter, which push temperatures down, bringing rain and wind that can be strong. Wind speeds have reached 100 km per hour. In the 1990s, various studies warned that the Tabasco coastline was fragile and vulnerable to erosion by storms. However, neither the federal or state governments have taken action to build sea walls or take other preventative measures. The Sánchez Magallanes area is the most vulnerable because of the lagoons separated from the Gulf by only meters wide strips of land. Damage to these lagoons cause economic hardships to both fishing and agriculture. A study in 1998 by the Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco stated that economic activities such as farming and grazing, construction and lack of planning had produced grave environmental damage in the coastal areas of Sánchez Magallanes. These activities has caused much of the native coastal vegetation to disappear. Construction of the coastal highway in the 1970s provoked the disappearance of dunes, allowing waves to come further onshore during storms. This with increased winter storm activity, blamed on the “El Niño” phenomenon and global climate change have caused severe damage in the area with kilometers of beach washed away and farmland and lagoon areas damaged by sea water. Waves during storms now can reach the inland lagoons and causing higher salinity in the ground and water, killing plant and animal species. The manatee and pejelagarto fish have disappeared and oyster production has diminished. There are houses and other structures only meters from the Gulf waterline, which are susceptible to wind and erosion damage, often with only sandbags as buffers. About twenty km of the 92 km highway connecting the town with Paraiso have been destroyed or heavily damaged by erosion. In 2010, the area’s beaches were closed by the state Secretary of Tourism before the Holy Week vacation period because of severe erosion. During the 2009/2010 winter storm season, there was severe damage to the beaches, mangroves and residential areas from here to Paraíso. This included flooding of the Del Carmen-Pajonal-Machona lagoon system, which damaged 104 houses and eroded three km of beaches. In 2010, the state employed foreign experts, principally from the Netherlands to study the erosion problem. Economy Fisherman in Del Carmen lagoon, just off main docks of town The local economy is heavily dependent on fishing even though there is some, farming, livestock, tourism and petroleum production. Fishing in the area includes sea bass, shark, crab and oysters some of which is exported to Japan. Oyster farming and collection is particularly important, providing up to 75% of many families’ annual income. There are eleven cooperatives farming 10.5 hectares in the Del Carmen-Pajonal-Machona lagoon area. These cooperatives recently received 300,000 pesos to help with the rehabilitation of these farm areas as well as help with the promotion of the oysters produced. The program is slated to help 950 families which are dedicated to this activity. However, fishing in the area has had problems. Phenomena such as red tide can be devastating to fishing. Fishing in the area suffers from pollution from petroleum drilling, lack of equipment and seasons in which fishing is not permitted. The Sociedades Cooperativas Acuícolas del Golfo states that fishing yields have dropped from 500 tons per year to 300 since drilling began off the Tabasco coast and the pollution also damages boats and other equipment. Mexico’s oil company PEMEX began drilling in the wetlands areas around the peninsula in the 1960s, which has closed some areas such as the Chicozapote River and the El Yucateco lagoon to fishing because of pollution. Local residents complain that fish in the area can taste of oil and must fry it in order to get rid of the unwanted flavor. In 2005, PEMEX cleaned twelve tons of tar and other material contaminated by hydrocarbons from the beaches of Tabasco, including those of Sánchez Magallanes. Sánchez Magallanes is one of the beach areas regularly monitored for oil related pollution, especially before the vacation season of Holy Week. It is an area that the municipality promotes for tourism because of its beaches, the Del Carmen Lagoon and the El Pajaral Island, on which live a wide variety of bird species. The beaches in and around the town receive about 8,000 visitors during the spring, when the weather is best, especially during the vacation period of Holy Week. One particularly popular beach is called Acapulquito (Little Acapulco) as access to the sea is free and easy. This beach is also the site of a music festival during the holidays. The Ensueño del Trópico Water Park is located on the Gulf coast on a beach which is four km long and sixty meters wide. It has fine, white sand and warm, blue waters with gentle waves. The water is shallow up to fifty meters away from shore.

He is the patron saint of Termoli.  Legend  One of the earliest Christian communities is believed to have been established in Lucera. The legend of the saint relates that in about the year 60 Saint Peter passed through and put Bassus at the head of the nascent bishopric. Bassus was martyred under Trajan in 118. His feast day is 5 December.  Disagreements on identity  There is some controversy regarding the identity of Bassus, in that there is potential confusion between Saint Bassus of Lucera and Saint Bassus of Nice (or Nicaea), who was also a bishop and martyr and whose feast day also falls on 5 December, although his martyrdom took place at Niceor Nicaea in about 250. There may also be confusion with a certain Saint Dasius of Dorostoro, also known as Bassus.

Eye problems may include coloboma, microcornea, and glaucoma. Some affected infants may have complete absence of the eyes (anophthalmia). Most affected infants have developmental delay and intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe. Other physical abnormalities associated with this disorder can include an unusually small head (microcephaly), and malformations of the teeth, ears, fingers or toes, skeleton, and genitourinary system. The range and severity of findings vary from case to case. Formal diagnosis criteria do not exist. Lenz microphthalmia syndrome is also known as LMS, Lenz syndrome, Lenz dysplasia, Lenz dysmorphogenetic syndrome, or microphthalmia with multiple associated anomalies (MAA: OMIM 309800). It is named after Widukind Lenz, a German geneticist and dysmorphologist. Genetics Lenz microphthalmia syndrome is inherited as an X-linked recessive genetic trait and is fully expressed in males only. Females who carry one copy of the disease gene (heterozygotes) may exhibit some of the symptoms associated with the disorder, such as an abnormally small head (microcephaly), short stature, or malformations of the fingers or toes. Molecular genetic testing of BCOR (MCOPS2 locus), the only gene known to be associated with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, is available on a clinical basis. One additional locus on the X chromosome (MCOPS1) is known to be associated with LMS. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis A somewhat similar X-linked syndrome of microphthalmia, called oculofaciocardiodental syndrome (OFCD) is associated with mutations in BCOR.

Of Lithuanian-Jewish heritage, she survived Vilnius Ghetto and the Kaiserwald and Stutthof Nazi concentration camps as a young girl (ages 8 to 12).  Early life  Susanne Weksler was born in Paris on November 14, 1932 where her parents were completing their studies. After the Wekslers returned to Vilnius, Weksler attended Jewish school until the German occupation of the city in June 1941. Weksler's parents owned Bon-Ton, a clothing store in Vilnius. Her father, Isak Weksler, and mother, Raja Indurski Weksler, were divorced when Weksler was just seven years old. A short time after Bon-Ton was nationalized during the Russian occupation of Vilnius (1940–1941), Raja married Julek Rauch, a Polish Jew from Przemyśl, where Julek had attended a German school. Grandfather Weksler and grandfather Indurski owned businesses in Vilnius and, as they were considered wealthy, the Indurski and Weksler families barely avoided deportation to Siberia during the Russian occupation.  German occupation  Two days after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, when Weksler was eight years old, Germans occupied Vilnius and her father, Isak Weksler was arrested as a Jew and was eventually sent to his death at Ponary. In early September 1941, Weksler and her extended family were incarcerated in the Vilnius Ghetto. Upon liquidation of the ghetto beginning on September 24, 1943, Suzanne and Raja survived a brutal selection in the Christian Rasos Cemetery. Raja passed the selection of those fit for work with Suzanne hidden in a canvas bag she carried on her back. They were sent for forced labor to the Kaiserwald concentration camp near Riga, Latvia. By standing on her toes at roll call and later wearing a turban and high heels, the 11-year-old appeared tall enough to pass as an adult. During one selection of the weak for executions, the Wehrmacht sergeant in charge of the work detail grabbed Weksler's arm and forced her into a coal bin, which stood next to the stove in his room, thus saving her life. Upon liquidation of Kaiserwald, Weksler and her mother were transported to the Stutthof concentration camp on October 1, 1944. Conditions at Stutthof were brutal and sick and weak prisoners were routinely gassed or given lethal injections. Upon the approach of the Red Army, Stutthof was evacuated and Suzanne and Raja barely survived the eleven-day death march, in snow and freezing temperatures to the Tauentzien Camp (present-day Tawęcino), near Lauenburg (Lębork). Suzanne became ill and was too sick to join the evacuation march from Tauentzien on March 7, 1945. When the camp was liberated by the Red Army, Suzanne was in a coma. It was a full week before she recovered consciousness.  After liberation  Of her extended family of some thirty individuals only Suzanne, her mother and an uncle survived. After the war Weksler attended school in Poland and in 1950 she immigrated to Israel, serving in the Israel Defense Forces until 1952. She married David Rabinovici in 1953 and had two sons, born in 1955 and 1961. Suzanne Weksler, now Schoschana Rabinovici, lived in Tel Aviv and Vienna since 1964.  Memoir  Described as “Particularly grim, even for a Holocaust memoir”, Thanks to My Mother was described by one reviewer as “one of the most moving memoirs I have ever read of the Holocaust”. The same reviewer writes that readers whose interest include Holocaust testimonies and are “mentally prepared for the harshness of Rabinovici's experiences, will come away with renewed appreciation of the extraordinary fortitude required to survive those dire times”. The book gives a rare, detailed view of Jewish life in Vilnius, Lithuania during German occupation and contains gritty descriptions of life in the Vilnius Ghetto and the circumstances of those deported from the ghetto for slave labor in Germany. It is written from the viewpoint of a young girl from the age of about eight to twelve. Writes JWeekly.com...“It is also the story of Raja Indursky-Wexler’s profoundly transcendent love for her daughter…the daughter's memoir is at once riveting, blood-chilling, heartbreaking and, ultimately, awe-inspiring.” The book is designated as an American Library Association notable book and is the 1999 winner of the Mildred L. Batchelder Award. The award seeks to recognize translations of children's books into the English language (in this case by James Skofield from the original German), with the intention of encouraging American publishers to translate high quality foreign language children's books.

A French frigate captured her in 1782 while she was on the return leg of her maiden voyage to India as an East Indiaman for the British East India Company (EIC). However, the British recaptured her in October 1782. The EIC purchased her and sent her back to England. There, in 1785, George Macartney Macauley purchased her and renamed her Pitt. She then performed five voyages for the British East India Company (EIC) between 1786 and 1798. In between, she made one journey transporting convicts from England to New South Wales. She was broken up in 1801. Fortitude (Maiden voyage 1781) Captain Charles Gregorie (or Gregory) left Portsmouth on 13 March 1781 bound for Madras and Bengal. Fortitude was part of a convoy of Indiamen and transports under the escort of a British squadron under Commodore George Johnstone, who was sailing to capture the Cape Colony. On 16 April the French attacked the British squadron and convoy at the battle of Porto Praya, off São Tiago. The French captured Fortitude, but as her captors towed her out to sea, her crew and the troops of the 92nd Regiment of Foot she was transporting,Campbell et al.

When the French captured her they freed some eight men from Artésien, who had been part of the French prize crew at the battle of Porto Praya. Fine brought Fortitude to Cuddalore, where Suffren's squadron was anchored, arriving there on 29 June. The French listed her as an 800-tonne, 22-gun fluyt. In early July 1782, during the run-up of the Battle of Negapatam, Suffren sent Fortitude and Yarmouth (a 24-gun British storeship that Fine had also captured) to Île de France (Mauritius). On 1 August, he sent her to Bago to purchase rigging parts, under Captain Geslin. After the battle, Fortitude had to cede her mainmast to , which herself had ceded hers to .Troude, p. 188 The French then sold Fortitude to Portuguese merchants at Calcutta. The EIC purchased her in October at Madras for Rs.35,000, and used her to convey General Stuart and his staff back to England. Fortitude arrived back in the River Thames on 21 January 1785. George Macaulay purchased her on 29 October 1785 and renamed her Pitt. EIC voyages 1 & 2 EIC voyage 1 (1786–87) Captain George Cowper sailed from the Downs on 28 March 1786, bound for China. Pitt arrived at Whampoa on 30 August. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar, which is about 20 miles downriver from Whampoa, on 20 January 1787, and reached St Helena on 26 May. She arrived at the Downs on 6 August. Cowper died almost immediately thereafter. EIC voyage 2 (1788–89) Cowper's replacement, Captain Edward Manning, left the Downs on 26 December 1788, bound for St Helena, Benkulen, and China. Pitt reached St Helena on 29 March 1789 and Benkulen on 14 July, and arrived at Whampoa on 30 November. She crossed the Second Bar on 19 February 1790, reached St Helena on 11 June, and arrived at the Downs on 7 August. Convict transport (1791-92) Under Manning's command, Pitt sailed from Yarmouth Roads, England on 17 July 1791, with 352 male and 58 female convicts. She also carried Lieutenant-Governor Francis Grose and a company of the New South Wales Corps, as well as wives and children of the passengers and convicts. During the roughly two weeks after she left St Jago, a fever broke out that killed seven seamen, 18 soldiers, four soldiers' wives, five soldiers' children, 16 convicts, and two convicts' children. Manning had to free some convicts so that they could help man the vessel. Pitt arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 1 October, and stayed there more than three weeks, leaving on 25 October. While she was there, four convicts took advantage of their freedom to escape; another escaped when Pit stopped at the Cape. Pitt arrived at Port Jackson, New South Wales on 14 February 1792. Twenty male and nine female convicts died during the voyage. Total deaths, not including children, numbered 49. Five male convicts escaped during the voyage,Free Settler or Felon?

At the Cape, the Dutch authorities later recaptured the escapee from Pitt, the convicted forger and future Australian artist Thomas Watling, and put him aboard Royal Admiral. (Pitt, Royal Admiral, and , the three convict transports that arrived in Australia in 1792, are often referred to as the Fourth Fleet.) Pitt brought with her what would be . Francis was a 41-ton (bm) colonial schooner that was partially constructed at the Deptford Dockyard, England, and loaded aboard Pitt in frame. Pitt departed Port Jackson in March 1792 for England, via Batavia and Bengal. In sailing north from Port Jackson, Manning sailed through the Solomon Islands into New Georgia Sound, and then north in the passage to the Pacific between Choiseul Island and Santa Isabel Island. This he named Manning Straits, which name it retains to this day.Guppy (1887), p.266. Sikopo island () lies within the strait.

Her masters, like virtually all EIC captains, procured letters of marque. These authorized the captains to engage in offensive action against the French or their allies, should the occasion arise. EIC voyage 3 (1792–93) This voyage brought Pitt home after her voyage to Australia. Manning and Pitt left Diamond Harbour on 17 December 1792. She reached the Cape on 21 March 1793, St Helena on 14 April, Cork on 29 June, and Portsmouth on 13 July. She arrived at the Downs on 7 August. Manning was issued his first letter of marque on 23 April 1793, shortly after war began, and effectively while Pitt was between St Helena and home. EIC voyage 4 (1794–95) Manning received a second letter of marque on 6 June 1794. He sailed from Plymouth on 23 June 1794, bound for Bengal. Pitt reached the Cape on 9 September and Diamond Harbour on 7 December.

Pitt reached the Cape on 18 November and arrived at Madras on 17 February 1797. She reached Kedgeree on 28 February. She was at Diamond Harbour on 20 March. She passed Kedgeree on 1 July, and stopped at Madras again on 15 August. From there she returned to Diamond Harbour, which she reached on 23 September, and was at Calcutta on 4 October. The reason for the to-and-fro was that the British government planned an expedition 1797-8 against Manila. (One of the Royal Navy vessels involved appears to have been HMS Sybille.) The EIC held eight regular ships, and three \\"dismantled ships\\" in India to support the expedition. None of the three went to Penang, but instead went to the Coromandel Coast with stores and back to Bengal. A peace treaty with Spain resulted in the British cancelling the planned expedition. Of the three dismantled ships, Pitt, Lascalles, and Royal Admiral, it held Pitt for 229 days. For Pitt, he owners claimed demurrage of £6,655 6s 3d.Asiatic Annual Register for the Year 1805 (1807), p.53. Gerrard sued the EIC for £4,000 for extra expenses, including £2,500 loss on the sale of investments \\"under prime costs\\". The court awarded him £250 and £750. The court further ordered that the officers of the vessels involved receive some payment.

They were founded in 1910 in Santarém, Brazil, by the Rt. Rev. Armand August Bahlmann, O.F.M., and Mother Immaculata (born Elizabeth Tombrock), both natives of Germany, to educate the children of the poor throughout the world. The founders The bishop Armand Bahlmann was born in Essen, Germany, on 8 May 1862. He grew up a devout but strong-willed boy, wanting to become a missionary. To that end, he joined the Order of Friars Minor when he was of age. He was ordained a Catholic priest on 22 September 1888, and served in various works of the Order in his homeland, earning two doctorates, before being assigned to serve in the missions of the Order in Santarém, Brazil. In January 1907 he was appointed Territorial Prelate of the region by the Holy See. He went to Rome, where he was consecrated a bishop on 19 July of that year, by Cardinal Girolamo Maria Gotti, O.C.D., the Prefect of the Propagation of the Faith.Catholic Hierarchy In the course of his service in the country Bahlmann developed a desire to establish a community of teaching Sisters for the children of the region. For this, he enlisted a small community of cloistered Conceptionist nuns established in the region, who were at time a branch of the Poor Clares, the contemplative Second Order within the Franciscan Order, founded in Spain in the 15th century. As contemplatives, however, they lacked the experience and training for teaching. He had this on his mind when he traveled to Germany on a fundraising trip. It was in the course of this trip that he met the woman who would help him fulfill his plans. The teacher =Early life= Elizabeth Tombrock was born in Ahlen, Germany, on 14 November 1887. She was a frail child, prone to ill health. Early in her life, she learned to love God and would accompany her mother in visiting the sick and bringing food to the poor. When she was a teenager she joined the Third Order of St. Francis. The young Tombrock developed a great love for children and chose to become a teacher. As a teacher, she devoted herself to educating her charges with knowledge, life values, and a great love for Jesus and his Mother. Her career was cut short, however, as she was diagnosed with tuberculosis in her bones in 1920. Eventually she was diagnosed as incurable and advised to prepare for her death. =Miracle and vocation= Not abandoning hope, Tombrock made a pilgrimage to the famed Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France, noted for the many healing miracles which had taken place there. Arriving there on 15 August 1909, she took part in a religious ceremony. In the course of that service, she seemed to become unconscious for some twenty minutes. Later she recounted that she had been conscious during that time, but was filled with the fullness of happiness...my heart was too weak to endure. Feeling changed, Tombrock went to one of the physicians stationed there to monitor the health of the pilgrims. She was found to have been totally cured of the disease. Back in her beloved classroom, Tombrock knew she wanted to dedicate her life to God. She struggled, however, whether to enter the cloistered Poor Clares or to volunteer as a missionary for overseas service. At that point, she and Bahlmann came into contact with one another. Later, Tombrock was in the process of writing a letter to the Poor Clares seeking admission to the cloister. She stopped and knelt in prayer for final guidance in this step. At that moment, there was a knock at the door and she received a telegram from Bishop Bahlmann, asking her if she were willing to become a missionary in Brazil and teach poor children there. Tombrock felt that this was her answer from God. =The missions= After an abbreviated period of training in the life of the Poor Clares, Tombrock was conditionally received into the Order of St. Clare and given the habit of the Franciscan Second Order on 15 August 1910, the anniversary of her miraculous healing. At that time, she received the name of Sister Maria Immaculata of Jesus. Soon after that she and Bahlmann set sail for Brazil. Foundation Missionary Poor Clares The pair arrived in Santarém on 5 December 1910, when Mother Immaculata joined four Conceptionist nuns who had agreed to join the bishop's new venture. Together they moved into an old mansion, which was to serve as their monastery as well as an orphanage and school. The small community then began their canonical novitiate. The house was in poor condition, and the town was a poor one. Yet, despite continued poor health due to the climate and diet, Mother Immaculata led the group successfully. After a brief fundraising and recruiting trip to Germany, she was professed on the Feast of the Epiphany (6 January) 1916. The next day she was formally appointed as abbess of the community by Bahlmann. Under the protection of Bahlmann, who dealt with most of the legal hurdles in establishing the community and the work, Mother Immaculata led and shaped a community composed of both native Brazilians and German women in Santarém, plus a house of formation in Germany. The financial struggles remained, though. Bishop Bahlmann and Mother Immaculata embarked on a fundraising trip to the United States in 1922. There she received a solution to their money worries, but not an easy one. The Franciscan friars of the Province of the Holy Name offered to subsidize the works of her community, if they would handle the food services for the friars' institution of higher learning, St. Bonaventure University, in central New York State. St. Bonaventure University Mother Immaculata was reluctant to commit her community to this work, but eventually concluded that it was the best solution to their financial stability. She summoned a group of nuns and established a small convent for them on the grounds of the university. It was a struggle for them, even the Germans, as their training had been as teachers, not the feeding of hundreds of friars, seminarians, professors and students. Mother Immaculata resumed her fundraising tour around the country. On her return to the university during 1923, preparing to go back to Brazil, she found the nuns struggling with their new tasks and went to help. The abbess wanted to help and was carrying a basket of cutlery when she suffered a heart attack. Even worse, she was on some stairs at the time, and suffered a severe fall, which left her unable to walk. She was diagnosed as having badly damaged her shoulder and having displacing two ribs. She was referred to a hospital in New York City, where she was advised that she would eventually be paralyzed for the rest of her life, and that she could not survive a trip to Brazil. She was never to return there. During that trip, Mother Immaculata purchased an old farmhouse in Paterson, New Jersey, where she established the novitiate of the congregation. Early in 1924, the abbess became bedridden and in July of that year was transported to the convent at St. Bonaventure, where she spent the rest of her life. Missionary Sisters Mother Immaculata proceeded to govern the communities of the monastery from her sickbed. Groups of young German women continued to join Brazilians in seeking admission to the community. Soon Pope Pius X asked the community to expand their field of labors to other countries in need. Changes in Church law at the time made a change of structure necessary. Thus, from the a community of nuns of the Second Franciscan Order, the community became a congregation of Religious Sisters of the Franciscan Third Order Regular. Mother Immaculata's title changed from Abbess to Superior General, and a Council was established of four Sisters to assist in the governance of the new congregation. At that time, the name of the community was changed to the current one, indicating their origins in the Conceptionist Order, but showing their new status. Deaths of the founders Mother Immaculata died peacefully in her bed at St. Bonaventure on 23 April 1938, surrounded by her Sisters. After 32 years as Prelate of Santarém, Bahlmann died in that post on 5 March 1939. Currently In their response to the call of the pope, the congregation established missions in China, which, after the Chinese Communist Revolution, were forced to relocate to Taiwan, but recently some of the Sisters have returned to the mainland to work. They now also serve in Angola, Bolivia and Namibia. The Missionary Sisters remained at St. Bonaventure until the 1960s. At that point, they moved the administration of the congregation to the novitiate in Paterson. In the United States, besides New Jersey, they serve in California, Maine, New Mexico, Texas and Washington, D.C.Website of the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception Notable members A Brazilian member of the congregation has gained international renown, Saint Sister Dulce Pontes, S.M.I.C., (1914–1992) known in Brazil as Irmã Dulce.

He also developed a method of cutting into a heart with a use of a plastic well that allowed to avoid a catastrophic loss of blood. Gross was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was also Surgeon-in-chief, cardiovascular surgery, Children's Hospital, Boston. Gross was a founder of the American Board of Surgery and the American Board of Thoracic Surgery. He also was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a board member of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Society of University Surgeons. In 1941 he coauthored \\"Abdominal Surgery of Infancy and Childhood\\" with Dr.William E Ladd. The book is considered a classic in surgical literature. Gross was elected to the American Pediatric Hall of Fame. The National Academies Press said that he \\"made many contributions that have altered the practice and understanding of surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology throughout the world\\".

It displays a clear shock wave shock shell pattern. It was probably a type Ia supernova, as indicated by the detection in 2004 of the elements silicon and iron. Any surviving stars should not have moved far from the site of the explosion. Researchers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. have identified light from the supernova that was reflected off of interstellar dust, delaying its arrival at Earth by 400 years, allowing scientists to study the initial blast. This delay, called a light echo, allowed the astronomers to measure the spectral signature of the light from the explosion. By virtue of the color signature, astronomers were able to deduce it was a Type Ia supernova. Scientists have also observed the supernova remnant at X-ray and visible wavelengths, and studied a light echo that helps assess the energy involved in this unusually energetic supernova.

It is the second of three books featuring the Makepeace sisters, Charlotte and Emma,Anita Silvey, ed: Children's books and their creators (New York, Houghton Mifflin, 1995), p. 238. These three books are sometimes known as the Aviary Hall books. Background At the age of twenty-one, Penelope Farmer was contracted for her first collection of short stories, The China People. One story originally intended for this collection proved too long to include. This was rewritten as the first chapter of The Summer Birds (1962), her first book featuring Charlotte and Emma Makepeace.'Penelope Farmer' in Something About the Author 105 (1999) p. 67 The Summer Birds received a Carnegie Medal commendation in 1963. A second book, Emma in Winter, set roughly two years later, with Emma as the main character followed in 1966. The main settings of both these books are a small village school in the South Downs in southern England, and Aviary Hall, the girls' home. Charlotte Sometimes followed in 1969, set slightly before the events of Emma in Winter, which follows Charlotte's first term in a London boarding school. According to Farmer, Charlotte and Emma, who grow up in their Grandfather Elijah's house, were originally based on her mother and her mother's sister as children, having no parents and \\"…having to be everything to each other,\\" one being the responsible one, the other being rather difficult.'Penelope Farmer' in Something About the Author 40 (1985) p. 77 Penelope Farmer stated that while writing Emma in Winter, she did not realise that identity was such a predominant theme in the novel until she encountered Margery Fisher's comments in on the book in Growing Point. She had a similar realisation, this time on her own, while writing Charlotte Sometimes. Emma in Winter is dedicated to Judy (1939‒1991), Penelope Farmer's older twin sister. Plot summary It is wintertime. Emma's older sister Charlotte leaves Aviary Hall to stay with a schoolfriend, and then to return to her second term at her London boarding school. Emma, along with her classmate Bobby Fumpkins, simultaneously begin a series of dreams of being able to fly again, as they were able to do in The Summer Birds. Bobby, being fat, is consistently teased by his classmates. Emma is also initial hostile towards Bobby, but realises that not only does Bobby appear in these dreams, but he is also having the same dreams. As the two oldest children in the school, Bobby and Emma are appointed head boy and head girl. In the dreams, they fly over their village and the South Downs, with the North Downs and the sea visible in the distance. They are observed and shadowed by an evil presence, initially appearing as a pair of eyes watching them. Strangely, the trees in their dreams consistently shrink downwards into the ground. Bobby realises that in their dreams, they are being dragged backwards in time. In successive dreams, they travel farther and farther back in time, visiting the Ice Age and seeing a mammoth, and a distant prehistoric time where they see a monstrous dinosaur. They speculate if they will eventually arrive at the beginning of the world, and if they will see the Garden of Eden. Eventually, in their final dream, Emma and Bobby are dragged back to the beginning of the world. They stand on a rocky shore facing the sea, and are confronted by the evil being, revealed as a grotesque, distorted form of their teacher, Miss Hallibutt. The being threatens to consume them by taking away their thoughts of reality. After transforming itself into replicas of Emma and Bobby themselves, its attempts are defeated by the two children being able to concentrate on reality and of their home and their school. The children are jerked out of the dream world and return to reality. As term draws to a close, the thaw comes, and the children at school react with great joy, with Emma realising that Charlotte will soon be return home after her second term at the boarding school. Bobby and Emma walk home, with the children knowing they will not return to the dream world. As Bobby runs up the laneway to his home, Emma calls out to him, \\"Pleasant dreams, Bob, pleasant dreams!\\" Continuity Emma in Winter features the same village school setting as The Summer Birds. It is set around a year and a half after the events of The Summer Birds, and follows soon after the events of Charlotte Sometimes. Charlotte has left their small village school, and is now in her second term at boarding school. While in the absence of the mysterious bird- boy, the children are not able to fly, in Emma and Bobby's dreams, they retain this ability. Emma in Winter gives some explanation for the time travel phenomenon seen in both this book and in \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\". Emma and Bobby sneak into Grandfather Elijah's study, and read an article where time is described as being like a coiled spring, which can be pushed together, so that some moments in time can be very near a moment in another time.Penelope Farmer, Emma in Winter. London: Chatto & Wyndus, 1969, Ch. 4 Reviews Emma in Winter was reviewed by The Sunday Times, 'Miss Farmer is strong on character and situation and understands the subtle changes between solid everyday life and the supernatural. As much a story of antagonism and growing friendship between a boy and a girl in a very real village school as it is a clearly conceived fantasy rapt in a dreamlike world.'Penelope Farmer, Emma in Winter. London: Chatto & Wyndus, 1969, Cover notes The Daily Telegraph wrote, 'The writing is curiously haunting, and the interplay between the children very perceptive, but always entertaining and robust.' The Times Educational Supplement wrote, 'Here is a book which achieves a delicate balance between fantasy and fact and which will have lasting appeal...'. Margery Fisher reviewed the novel in Growing Point, writing that Penelope Farmer '...gives tangible form to the emotions of children in a dream-sequence brilliantly sustained in the author's elegant rhythmic style.' Children's Book News commented on the novel, 'This book has a compelling quality given by intense feeling and writing which has real distinction.'

Biography Harry Bruno was born 7 February 1893 in London, England. His father Henry Augustine Bruno was a marine insurance analyst; his mother was Annie (Thompson) Bruno. In 1907 Henry brought his family to New York City. Young Harry came under the influence of Elbert Hubbard, who said simply, \\"To have a friend you must be a friend\\". Hubbard and Harry's parents were sailing on the RMS Lusitania when it sank on 7 May 1915. Both Hubbard and the Brunos died. Harry was very close to his brother Frank Bruno (1901–33) who worked in the newspaper business. In 1972 he married Evelyn Denny Witten, who was with him when he died 21 March 1978 in Southampton (town), New York on Long Island. In 1910 Harry built a glider with his friend Bernie Mahon. Harry made a flight of 265 yards with it on 24 December. Harry and Bernie worked as runners on Wall Street, but Harry wanted to get ahead. He took a correspondence course in advertising and a job with the Herald newspaper of Montclair, New Jersey. Later he moved to Greenwich, Connecticut to work with the News and Graphic, working up to the position of assistant editor. When World War I began, Harry took pilot training at Deseronto Airport with the Canadian Royal Flying Corps, Squadron 84 at Camp Mohawk. His flight instructor was Vernon Castle, better known for his dancing. After the war Bruno worked for a time at the New York City Car Advertising Company. His heart was in aviation, but that field was in crisis as demand for aircraft had collapsed with the end of the war. Bruno landed a job as publicity man for the Manufacturers Aircraft Association. He took on the challenge of organising air meets, holding shows, noting record flights, and promoting aviation investment. To develop aviation transport, there was the need for airports, runway edge lights, navigational aids, and accurate weather forecasts. Public reassurance was also to be based on a national program of pilot licensing and certification. A coast to coast race was organised in 1919. In 1920 at the New York air show, Kathlene Martyn was hired to pose in silk pajamas for the \\"first sleeper plane\\". Harry Bruno was one of the original Quiet Birdmen who met at Marta's Restaurant in Greenwich Village, and wore their pin of silver and blue wings on his lapel. Harry Bruno behind opera star, Marguerite Sylva on the Vanderbilt with pilot Edwin Musick, 1922; Sylva dropped flowers on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, New York. In 1921 Harry joined with Inglis M. Uppercu, aircraft manufacturer in Keyport, New Jersey. The company Aeromarine converted Navy seaplanes into passenger planes; Bruno organised \\"ballyhoo jaunts\\" for reporters from local newspapers to gain publicity and a public appetite for flying. In 1922 Aeromarine offered the first regularly scheduled flights from New York to Miami, Key West, and Havana. Since passengers could drink liquor in Cuba, the service was called \\"The Highball Express\\". Aeromarine offered two trips daily between Cleveland and Detroit starting in June 1922. City officials, club leaders, and reporters were all given promotional flights to counter the reticence of the general public. When Harry rode with pilot Durston G. Richardson on a 7,500 mile tour of the Great Lakes, they were awarded the Glidden trophy by the New York Aero Club. By the time Aeromarine went out of business in September 1923, Bruno was a proven aviation promoter. Bruno was engaged by Anthony Fokker to promote his planes at a Saint Louis air show. Due to Fokker's association with the Germans during the war, this representation required Bruno's special abilities. The air show was presided over by a man with a microphone in a press box. Harry happened to know the man and offered to give him a break from the task. With microphone in hand, Bruno soon brought Fokker's airship to the centre of attention. Bruno helped promote skywriting by Jack Savage by having him write the telephone number to the Vanderbilt Hotel in New York City. Bruno helped Sherman Fairchild develop aerial photography as a business service. First agency With his friend Dick Blythe, Harry Bruno formed the firm of Bruno and Blythe. One of their first projects was the Ford National Reliability Air Tour from Dearborn Michigan to Omaha and back. At that time Bruno also worked part- time at WEBJ as program director and chief announcer. In 1925 Bruno and Blythe organised the air races at Mitchel Field on Long Island. To wake up Wall Street to aviation, they \\"organized a sham battle to take place over Wall Street at high noon\\" which was accompanied with \\"giant cannon firecrackers\\". Charles Lawrance, builder of a 200 horse-power engine, was brought in as a client of Bruno and Blythe. This engine was air-cooled and called Wright Whirlwind. The agency increased the profile of the Lawrance engines in Wright Aeronautical announcements. Another client was Juan Trippe who ran Colonial Air Transport and started with airmail contracts. Later he offered flights into South America with his Aviation Corporation of the Americas which became Pan Am. In 1926 Richard E. Byrd became a client. He and pilot Floyd Bennett had flown over the North Pole on 9 May but had $20,000 of expenses due. Contacting Grover Whalen, Bruno and Blythe arranged for their plane, Josephine Ford, to be put on display in the show window of Wanamaker's department store. For two weeks each in New York and Philadelphia, the exhibit paid off the debt and earned the firm its fee. Bruno and Blythe assisted Charles A. Lindbergh in his preparations for the trans-Atlantic flight winning him the Orteig Prize of $25,000. When Lindbergh grew weary of the demanding press that surrounded him, he was referred by Wright Aeronautical to Bruno and Blythe. Bruno negotiated a $125,000 exclusive contract with The New York Times for Lindbergh's story, if he managed to make France. Lindbergh had asked the United States Weather Bureau to notify him when there was a window of storm-free conditions over the notorious North Atlantic Ocean. With a flying time of 33 hours and 39 minutes, Spirit of Saint Louis brought Lindbergh to Le Bouget Field. Bruno and Blythe styled Lindbergh as a \\"plain citizen, dressed in the garments of everyday man\\" rather than a military uniform. They \\"had to hold at bay hundreds of people who sought to exploit the Lindbergh fame, especially women.\\" Bruno was promoting three companies building lighter-than-air vehicles. In October 1928 he met the arrival of LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin at Lakehurst Naval Air Station. He also represented the Aircraft Development Corporation of Detroit which built ZMC-2, an all-metal dirigible designed by Ralph Hazlett Upson. Bruno was also at the crash-burning of the LZ 129 Hindenburg on 8 May 1937. In fact, he pulled Captain Ernst Lehmann from the burning wreck, got him on his way to the hospital where he died. Handling competing accounts could be accommodated at Bruno and Blythe since they were \\"the only firm specializing in aviation publicity\\". In 1931 Bruno and Blythe represented Wiley Post and his stellar navigator Harold Gatty for their round-the-world tour with the Winnie Mae. Similarly, the Antarctica Expedition of Lincoln Ellsworth was their account. They also collected funds for Amelia Earhart. Though The Texas Company was providing aircraft to Frank Hawks, Bruno and Blythe represented him as he broke aviation records on point-to-point flights Among the corporate accounts held by Bruno and Blythe were Beech Nut Packing Company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Packard Motor Car Company, and Royal Typewriter. Boat show The National Boat Show was an account held by Bruno for 40 years. He started publicity for the Show in 1926, but he and Blythe realised that, without marinas where boats could be moored, the market for boats would be limited. Dick Blythe went to Miami, Florida to research the construction and operation of marinas. They wrote and circulated a manual with their findings to communities that had potential marinas. In their work a shortage of marinas was similar to a shortage of airports. To promote Essomarine, a product of Standard Oil, Bruno engaged artist Ted Geisel to develop a unique concept to sell the marine lubricant. Show visitors were invited into the Seuss Navy, an imaginary but well-illustrated and animated league. Marriage The actress Nydia de Sosnowska was a star in productions of Florenz Ziegfeld. Dick Blythe first dated her and introduced her to Harry. In 1930 Harry married Nydia and they made a home at Montauk, New York. Dick Blythe fell ill in 1932, travelled to England for rest. He recuperated but retired in 1934. During World War II he was involved in training pilots at the Royal Canadian Air Force base at Ottawa. He died 2 May 1942 from injuries sustained in a crash. Harry and Nydia became date and grapefruit farmers in 1942 when they purchased a ranch in the Coachella Valley in southern California. After a forty-year marriage, Nydia died in 1970. Children Prior to Nydia, while in his early 20s, Harry was married to Edith Lopez. At the age of 24, Harry and 21-year-old Edith had a daughter named Caroline, who was born on 29 November 1916 in Staten Island Hospital. Caroline Bruno would turn out to be his first and only child. His marriage to Edith lasted only a couple of years. War work Harry Bruno spontaneously solved an armaments preparedness problem in 1941 for the Office of Production Management. Parts suppliers could not offer their services without illustration of needed parts. Bruno became involved as agent for Atlas Corporation, and he heard from a press associate that Senator Harry Truman was getting involved. Bruno went to him with a plan of Defence Special Trains that would go to the communities of the parts suppliers and display needed parts. Agents of the Division of Contract Management for OPM were on the train to deal with suppliers. Bruno's scheme was adopted and implemented quickly. \\"American material manufacture got a head start before Pearl Harbour came.\\" Bruno had the account of Electric Launch Company of Bayonne, New Jersey. He prepared an event to celebrate the christening of the first PT boat . The breaking of the bottle was performed by Lt. Robert Montgomery. Also in attendance was John J. Hopkins, founder of General Dynamics, another account for Bruno. During the war Phelps Dodge engaged Bruno to suppress information on Operation Pluto. After the war Willys used his services to bring jeeps to the civilian market. In 1944 Bruno published his autobiography and aviation history: Wings over America: The Story of American Aviation. Second agency In 1939 Bruno was observing air races with Vincent Bendix. When Bendix asked for advice to promote his company, Bruno suggested the idea of a Bendix Trophy transcontinental air race. Bruno also promoted the Bendix automatic home laundry. They hired Betty Grable and American Airlines stewardesses to pose with and praise the machine. But more importantly, Bendix induced Bruno to move the agency offices to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, a more opulent locale. Lincoln Ellsworth donated furniture appropriate to the make-over of the office. In 1954 Bruno re-organized. The new firm was called H. A. Bruno and Associates. The title of executive vice- president and director was given to Russell D. Gudgeon. Gudgeon had been a newspaper editor and Associated Press bureau chief before coming to Bruno and Blythe. He had helped with the boat shows before serving in military intelligence during the war. Two other vice-presidents were named: Hudson Phillips and Theon Wright. As a friend of James Rand, Jr., Bruno came to the aid of Remington Rand when they needed to increase awareness of the UNIVAC I. Bruno suggested to the Columbia Broadcasting System that, when the election returns came in for the Presidential election of 1952, the computer be engaged to forecast the results from early returns. The computer performed well, both in forecasting, and meeting a larger market. He died in 1978.

Plot Dana Andrews portrays an American radio correspondent reporting from within Nazi Germany, whose principal source of information is an elderly philatelist. His reports prove so embarrassing to the regime that Captain von Rau sends his own fiancée, Karen Hauen (Virginia Gilmore), to compromise the reporter. As the philatelist is sent off to a concentration camp, it develops that she and the reporter are falling for each other, and the elderly source was actually her own father.

Melmastia requires hospitality and profound respect to be shown all visitors, regardless of distinctions of race, religion, national affiliation as well as economic status and doing so without any hope of remuneration or favour. Pashtuns will go to great extents to show their hospitality. Elphinstone in 1815 observed: \\"The most remarkable characteristic of the Afghans is their hospitality. The practice of this virtue is so much a point of national honor, that their reproach to an inhospitable man is that he has no Pushtunwali\\". (Elphinston 1969: 226). Hospitality to strangers is an obligation and is offered free, without expecting any reciprocity. But hospitality to one's kinsmen or tribesmen puts the recipient under reciprocal obligation, accompanied by the \\"fear that he will not be in the position to return it adequately when the occasion demands\\".

It was first broadcast on 2 January 2012 and ended on 17 March 2012. Format Series 1 Standing in a bank vault with 25 safe deposit boxes, four contestants answered questions to open the boxes and accumulate prize money during three rounds. The winner of the third round advanced to a grand final at the end of the week, in which their entire total was placed in a jackpot that went to the eventual winner. Scores were set to zero at the beginning of each round. =Round 1= In the first round, cash amounts totaling £150,000 were placed in the boxes, at least four of which were left empty. The contestants answered toss-up questions on the buzzer for 90 seconds. A miss froze the contestant out of the next question, while a correct answer stopped the clock and allowed them to open one box. The cash it contained (if any) was placed in a briefcase on the contestant's podium, and they then had to decide whether to continue playing, or exit the vault with their case and sit out the rest of the round. One contestant was eliminated with no winnings at the end of the round, based on the following rules: * If only one contestant remained in the vault when time ran out, they were automatically eliminated. * If everyone left early, the one with the lowest total was eliminated. * If more than one contestant remained in the vault when time ran out, the host continued asking toss-up questions. A correct answer allowed a contestant to open one box, whose contents were added to their total, and leave the vault. The last contestant remaining in the vault was eliminated. =Round 2= The second round was played under the same rules as the first. Now, though, each contestant had two cases and could only place one bundle of cash in each. A contestant who answered a question correctly and found cash could either fill and close one case, or discard it in hopes of finding a larger amount later. Contestants had to remain in the vault as long as they had at least one case open, and were required to leave as soon as both were filled. =Round 3= The total amount in the boxes was increased to £200,000, with at least four each of zeroes and \\"Steal\\" cards hidden among them. Each of the two remaining contestants had one case and an individual 45-second clock, and only one played at a time. The contestant with the higher combined total from the first two rounds decided who would play first. Once a contestant answered a question correctly, their clock stopped and they chose a box, whose amount was added to their case. Finding a Steal allowed them to take the largest bundle from the opponent's case, as long as the opponent had any cash and was still in the vault. As before, after any correct answer, a contestant could either continue playing, or leave the vault and sit out the round. If they chose to continue, control passed to the opponent. The contestant who brought out more cash before their own clock ran out advanced to the series final, and the total they had accumulated during the entire game was added to the series jackpot. =Final= The winners of the five preliminary episodes competed through four rounds. The first two rounds followed the same format as the preliminaries, while the third followed the Round 1 rules but retained the Steal element. In the fourth round, the two remaining contestants were each given two cases, one containing half the total jackpot (\\"Cash\\") and one containing newspaper (\\"Trash\\"). Each chose one case to give to the other, in a variant of the prisoner's dilemma. * If both gave Cash, they split the jackpot evenly. * If one gave Cash and the other Trash, the Trash-giving contestant won the entire jackpot. * If both gave Trash, neither won any money and the jackpot was split among the other three contestants. Series 2 In series 2, instead of a tournament format, the winner of each game received whatever cash they had earned in Round 3 and returned to compete in the next episode. Other changes were as follows: * Steals were present in all three rounds. * One box in each round held a \\"Bankrupt\\" card, which reset a contestant's total to zero if found. Totals from previous rounds were not affected. * The Round 1 time limit was reduced to 75 seconds. * In Round 2, a contestant could choose to leave the vault after filling only one of their two cases. * In Round 3, the total in the boxes was £150,000 plus the amounts collected by the two remaining contestants in Rounds 1 and 2. * The final was played with four preliminary winners and the highest-scoring runner-up, and a jackpot of £100,000 was at stake in the fourth round. =The Celebrity Bank Job= For the last two episodes of series two (16 and 17 March 2012), eight celebrities played The Bank Job for charity. The contestants on the 16 March episode were Amy Childs, Alex James, Donal MacIntyre and Rachel Riley. On the 17 March episode, the contestants were Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Martin Kemp, Shappi Khorsandi and Olivia Lee. The winner took home whatever they found in the final round, and the runner-up earned £5,000 for their charity. Riley won the first special, taking home £36,000 for her charity, and Shappi Khorsandi won the second special, taking home £59,000 for her charity. Transmissions The first series aired six episodes between 2 January through 7 January 2012. Viewership ranged from 1.03 million on 5 January to 1.30 million on 7 January. The second series aired eight episodes from 17 February to 10 March 2012, with a highest rating of 1.23 million viewers on 3 March. The celebrity specials aired on 16 and 17 March of that same year. Reception Metro's Christopher Hooton gave The Bank Job a scathing review, commenting that it was \\"just Deal or No Deal with added George Lamb and questions\\", and that despite its title, there were no elements evoking the feel of a Hollywood heist at all, \\"unless Ocean's Fourteen involves George Clooney answering questions about Pirates of the Caribbean in a Next cardigan whilst squealing with delight.\\" Readers of ukgameshows.com named it the sixth best new game show of 2012 in their \\"Hall of fame\\" poll but also the worst new game show of 2012 in their \\"Hall of shame\\" poll.http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Poll_of_the_Year_2012 References External links 2012 British television series debuts 2012 British television series endings 2010s British game shows British game shows Channel 4 game shows English-language television shows Television series by Endemol Television shows set in London ","title":"The Bank Job (game show)"},{"id":"34262992","text":"Francis was a 41 tons (bm) colonial schooner that was partially constructed at the Deptford Dockyard, England, and sent in frame aboard the Pitt to Australia to be put together for the purposes of exploration.

In close races, some teams will not make the playoffs until they have played the final game of the season, but other teams clinch a spot in the playoffs when they have mathematically qualified for the playoffs. A team mathematically qualifies for the playoffs when they have won enough games to qualify, including if they lose every remaining regular season game and all trailing teams win every remaining regular season game. In some leagues, only the leader of each division qualifies for the playoffs, thereby requiring clinching the division in order to clinch a playoff berth. But in many large sports leagues, additional wild card teams that have not finished at the top of their division will also contend in the playoffs, and these positions will also be sought by teams that are unable to reach the top. Ranking watchers, such as the media, keep track of when teams have clinched, or how close they are to achieving this (see Magic number (sports)). In standing charts displayed in newspapers and on websites, teams that have clinched a berth or even their division are generally indicated with various letters and symbols. A team's ranking among playoff teams is known as a seed. Teams with a higher seed are generally afforded greater privileges during the playoffs, including home advantage and byes. A team that has simply clinched a playoff berth may continue to try to win if they have a chance to obtain a higher seed. A team that has already clinched the highest possible seed during the regular season, or a team that cannot improve upon its seed, may be able to rest their starters during the remainder of the season.

Designed by the firm of Mulliken and Moeller and built by Gotham Building & Construction,New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Upper West Side/ Central Park West District Designation Report, Vol. I: Essay/ Architects' Appendix, April 24, 1990. the structure was erected as a luxury apartment house originally called the Central Park View.

When Mulliken and Moeller began working on the Central Park View in 1905 for an investor group known only as the Monticello Realty Company, they were also designing the Severn and Van Dyck apartments (found on the east side of Amsterdam Avenue between 72nd and 73rd streets) for a separate client.The Todd Family, https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/realestate/streetscapes-mulliken-moeller- architects-upper-west-side-designs-brick-terra.html In the following year, Mulliken and Moeller designed Rossleigh Court, the adjoining and similarly designed apartment building located on the northwest corner of 85th Street and Central Park West. In 1909, Dr. H. F. L. Ziegel and his wife, Beatrice, added the adjoining Neo-Georgian residence at 8 West 86th Street Situated opposite the 86th Street transverse to Central Park West on the southwest corner, the Central Park View's design followed the popular “French Flat” model in a Beaux Arts-style, modified to conform to the size of a twelve-story structure. Upon its completion, the new hotel anchored the eastern end of the developing West 86th Street. On the western end of West 86th Street, the Columbia Yacht Club had relocated to a site adjoining the Hudson River in 1874 and remained the other West 86th Street bookend until 1937.http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/columbia-yacht-club/ 257 Central Park West is located within the Upper West Side-Central Park West Historic District, designated on April 24, 1990. It is also located next to the 86th Street station of the New York City Subway (). Design  Exterior  Starting at the sidewalk level and moving up to the parapet, there is a simple but massive limestone base up to the windowsill at the 1st floor. From this level up to the level of the 3rd floor sill, there is a facing of limestone, with deep horizontal rusticated joints, terminating with a sill course above the 3rd floor. From the 3rd floor up to the sill level of the 4th floor, the course and window trims and 4th floor sill course are of architectural terracotta, with an isolated alternate course of red face brick. From this 4th floor to the sill of the 11th floor, the façade is red face brick, with isolated courses, window trims and sills of architectural terracotta with three groups of suppressed window balcony and pediment head trims on each facade of architectural terracotta, and with continuous vertical corner quoins of architectural terracotta. The 11th floor sill course is a continuous suppressed cornice of modest projection. From this level to the 12th floor sill level, the wall treatment is essentially a repetition of the treatment between the sill levels of the 3rd and 4th floor, but with a wide, prominently projecting, and continuous sill cornice. At the 12th floor, the wall is red face brick, with quoins of architectural terracotta at the corners of the building. The street walls are thirty-four inches thick in the cellar, twenty-six inches thick at the 1st and 2nd floors, sixteen inches thick from the 3rd to 7th floors, and twelve inches thick from the 8th floor to the parapet above the main roof.  Interior  The framing system consists of cast-iron columns carrying steel girders and steel beams, which in turn support concrete floors and the roof deck. The columns rest upon cast-iron base-plates, which in turn rest upon masonry piers founded on the schist bedrock laying a short distance below the cellar floor level. Continuous peripheral foundations also resting upon bedrock carry the exterior masonry walls. These walls are self-supporting and independent of the steel framing system and are tied to the steel framing at every floor level. The floors consist of four-inch thick reinforced cinder concrete slabs. Although all floor slabs are level, the roof slab is framed with an integral slope so that it pitches downward gently from a uniformly high level at Central Park West and West 86th Street sides to a low level along the inner court sides and also downward from the south end of the west wing to a valley along the court walls. History  Opening  The Central Park View opened in 1906, in the midst of a decade which saw New York City add a number of its iconic structures. George B. McClellan, Jr. was mayor between 1904 and 1909, and during his Tammany-backed term of office, the Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge, the Municipal Ferry Pier, and the first IRT subway line were all completed. The construction of Grand Central Terminal and the erection of the New York Public Library Main Branch also were ongoing during this decade and would be completed soon after. Designed originally as a luxury apartment house,For an original cost of $950,000 according to the records at the Office of Metropolitan History. the main entrance faced north on West 86th Street and featured an ornate entrance opening from a porte cochère and leading into the lobby.Offering Plan for Premises at 257 Central Park West, 1978. From there, a central courtyard reached further into an open interior yard level providing both improved light and ventilation to the apartments above as well as privacy from the street. Central Park view in 1906. The original apartments were designed for luxury,New York Tribune, September 16, 1906, http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1906-09-16/ed-1/seq-12/ arranged in seven, nine, ten and eleven-room suites, each with two or three bathrooms. Each suite included the modern amenities of telephone service, an automated mail delivery system, filtered water, storage in the basement and elevators serving all floors. The interiors were designed elegantly, with parquet floors and apartments finished in quartered oak, birch and mahogany. The kitchen contained porcelain sinks and tubs, nickel-plated plumbing, gas ranges, and five-foot marble wainscoting. The interior courtyards and the broad exterior facing offered the rooms light and air. The custodian's apartment occupied part of the cellar and three apartments were built on the first floor. Each of the upper floors, namely the 2nd through 12th floors, was constructed with four apartments, making a total of forty-eight apartments, including the custodian's residence.  Multiple design changes  Hotel Peter Stuyvesant, ca. 1938The post card reads, \\"The PETER STUYVESANT, an outstanding residential hotel of the upper West Side, commands a beautiful vista of Central Part at 86th Street. The hotel has large single rooms and suites designed for occupancy of those who demand space and comfort. It has an excellent a la carte dining room, where choice wines and liquors are served, and a most attractive Sidewalk Cafe.\\" The original design did not last long. In 1907 the developer, the Monticello Realty Company, sold the new apartment to David H. Taylor and Charles W. Odgen for $1,850,000.According to a pair of articles in the New York Times, dated March 1, 1907, and August 14, 1907, the Monticello Realty Company sold the Central Park View for $1,250,000 and a building, the Chatham Court. The cash consideration was paid by Mr. David H. Taylor and the property contribution was made by Mr. Charles W. Odgen. Shortly thereafter in 1909 the central and south courtyards were excavated and a new single-floor roof was constructed at curb level to accommodate additional storeroom and a custodian's workroom. The building was sold again in November 1914The New York Sun, November 14, 1914, http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1914-11-21/ed-1/seq-15/ Laundry tubs and a water closet were added in the basement in 1917 but no other major renovation is recorded before 1918. From 1918 to 1920, the building underwent its first major renovation, the conversion from luxury apartment to the Hotel Peter Stuyvesant sponsored by the Sonn Brothers and the Peter Stuyvesant Operating Company.Hyman and Henry Sonn were Bavarian immigrants who became liquor dealers in the late 19th century and later developed several properties on the Upper West Side.They owned the property through the 1000 Westchester Avenue Company.The Peter Stuyvesant Operating Company leased the property from the Sonn Brothers under a 21-year lease, with a net lease value of $3,000,000 – a remarkably high value for the time. The lessee, led by William F. Ingold, conducted the refurbishment of the apartments to a residence hotel, with the plans provided by the architects Schwartz & Gross and B.N. Marcus. Under the new configuration, only a single apartment resided on the first floor, with new dining rooms and a reception area replacing the other two first floor apartments along the Central Park West front of the building. The entire first floor, in Cato and Belgian black marble, was adorned with blue and gold decoration.The New York Times, February 1, 1920. On the second through twelve floors were nineteen bedrooms, eleven living rooms, and nineteen bathrooms per level, alongside new partitioning and plumbing appropriate for hoteling use. Other later renovations again changed the usage of the first floor space. In 1939, a cabaret and piano bar was added to the first floor. Outside the striped awnings that once adorned each window on the Central Park West facade disappeared, as did the light well still present along the building to the south. By 1950, the elevator men were gone as the cars were upgraded to new automatic versions from their prior manual operation. This configuration lasted for nearly twenty years as the Hotel Peter Stuyvesant was operated by the Knott Hotel Corporation as a Class A hotel.A 1935 map of the Knott Hotels lists the Hotel Peter Stuyvesant at Central Park West at 86th Street. The hotel advertises that all rooms have baths, single rooms charges $4 per night and double rooms charge $6 per night. The telephone number is Trafalgar 7400. The neighborhood itself would change as the IND Eighth Avenue Line with its 5-cent fares opened in 1932 and replaced the uptown trolley system that once used the 86th Street transverse. More importantly, the independent subway line tied the uptown property and those near it to the bustling metropolis forming in midtown Manhattan, only one and a half miles to the south. The property was operated as a residential hotel up to its sale to Wilger Realty Corporation in 1941.The New York Times, January 21, 1941. By the late 1940s and 1950s, two other renovations again would change Hotel Peter Stuyvesant's footprint. In 1949, the partitioning on the second through twelfth floors again was changed to incorporate nineteen apartments per floor. In 1957, the western dining room and the cabaret, the latter having established a poor reputation with the police, were renovated to accommodate new medical and legal office space. In 1960, the property was sold again to Soltzer & Lampert, real estate operators.The New York Times, July 11, 1960. Dinner menu from 1938 In the 1960s, the notability of the building was limited, although Fred Rust and Bill Davies taught ballroom dancing in the first floor ballroom until 1967. Their departure appears to coincide with another sale of the property. Stuyvesant Apartments, a partnership formed between Simon Haberman and Walter Schulze, purchased the building on April 17. 1967. The building underwent an alteration completed in 1970 replacing all internal partitions, while maintaining its external features, and including eighty-nine apartments on the upper floors (eight per floor but nine on the ninth), a group medical center on the first floor, and a garage in part of the cellar. An entrance to the lobby was added on the Central Park West side, with the former entrance on West 86th Street being retained as an entrance for the medical center. The then-owners renamed the property as The Orwell House after the English author whom one of the sponsors enjoyed. That moniker remained until the early 2000s when the resident-shareholders decided to change the name to simply 257 Central Park West. Co-op conversion In 1978, Stuyvesant Apartments converted the apartments to co-operative ownership, selling most of the apartment units to the residents. The property has been owned by a private co-operative corporation for over thirty-five years. As the co-op was approaching its twenty-fifth anniversary in 2003, the co-operatives' shareholders began a series of renovations aimed at restoring its historical façade and modernizing its mechanical systems. Many of the residents and shareholders likewise have renovated their homes with designs that match the residence's elegance and location with modern conveniences. The proximity to Central Park and the Mariner's Gate at West 85th Street positions the century- old home very close to several attractions within Central Park: the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, the Delacorte Theater, the Shakespeare Garden, the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre, Bethesda Fountain, the Mariners and Abraham and Joseph Spector's playgrounds the Arthur Ross Pinetum, the Cleopatra's Needle, the Belvedere Castle, and the Winterdale Arch.Winterdale Arch.

The band released its debut album Become in 2011 with production by Chad Gray and Greg Tribbett in addition to mixing by Jeremy Parker.  History  The origins of the ensemble can be traced back to Arizona band The Cover Up. Lead vocalist Joe Cotela stated that things with The Cover Up were approaching a standstill, and that they were performing music swayed by Every Time I Die. Because the band was dissatisfied with Epic Records not properly promoting the album, the band decided to move on.\\"man-made-machine-on-tour-as-direct- support-to-tantric-this-fall\\", razorandtie.com. On October 2, 2015, Man Made Machine performed their final concert, and released B-Sides and Rarities, a compilation album of 34 songs. Shortly after performing their final show, lead vocalist Joe Cotela and percussionist Matthew Reinhard formed a new ensemble named DED along with guitarist David Ludlow and bassist Kyle Koelsch. In December 2016, the band published a music video for \\"FMFY\\", the first song portrayed by the band. In February of the following year, a similar release was made for \\"Anti-Everything\\", the second single from the band. At the end of that month, the ensemble announced that Mis.an.thrope, their debut studio album, is scheduled for release on July 14, 2017. However, the release date was changed to July 21, 2017.  Touring  The band has toured with Escape The Fate, Dr. Acula, Aranda and Shaman's Harvest.  Critical reception  Jennifer Beaudoin of WQBK-FM stated that \\"The band fits in very well with today’s popular rock bands, as they have similar sound and style, while showing the world what they have “become” since luckily being signed, recorded, released and on tour\\". Mark S.

(re-titled Alien Uprising in 2013) is a 2012 British science fiction film about an alien invasion, written and directed by independent British filmmaker Dominic Burns. It stars Bianca Bree, Sean Brosnan and Simon Phillips. U.F.O. was filmed in Crabtree Close, Allestree, Derby. Plot The story opens with a military team sent to a house in the countryside at midnight. They find a truck with one man dead and a trail of blood leading back to the house. Inside they find several targets (none of which are seen) and receive the kill-order. A series of gunshots rings out, accompanied by a series of screams. Moments later a young woman named Dana stumbles out of the house with blood on her hands, and gazes up at the sky in disbelief. Two days earlier, Dana and her friends engage in a night of heavy drinking, fighting, and carousing at a club: Michael, a lieutenant in the SAS, his best friend and warbuddy Robin, and Vincent. Robin proposes to Dana and she immediately accepts, while Michael hooks up with a beautiful American girl named Carrie. Vincent, however, acts very indecent towards a clubber and gets thrown out, along with Michael when he defends him. A fight ensues between Michael and the bouncers, with Robin and Dana joining in. Eventually the group heads back to Robin's house where Michael and Carrie have sex while Dana and Robin celebrate their engagement in a similar manner. Hung-over, they drunkenly stumble out of Robin's house, and discover that nobody on their street has mobile phone service or power. They are confronted by an apparently deranged tramp who insists that they are in danger from people with a purple mark. When a city- sized spaceship hovers over Derby, the city panics and society begins to break down. Michael, attempts to lead his friends to safety. They make their way to a store where their friend Pete works, but it is closed. The group rescues an immigrant from angry thugs, and Pete allows the group in through the side entrance. However, a riot breaks out when the crowd sees them gathering supplies, and looters attempt to steal their groceries. Michael frightens off the looters with a pistol, and the friends head back to Robin's house. Michael and Carrie go out to get fuel and ammunition for Michael's handgun, and they run into John, a gas station attendant who believes that the aliens will attack. Carrie suggests that the aliens are explorers, but John says that there will be no lasting peace, because even if the aliens don't attack first, the human governments will panic and attack the aliens, inciting them to respond in kind. Back in the car, Carrie tells Michael that she is in England to learn about its culture and people, and they are involved in a car accident. Carrie frantically tries to save a survivor, but Michael administers a mercy killing when it becomes clear that will not make it. As Michael tries to drag Carrie away, she insists that there's a girl (seen earlier at the Market Square) still alive in the car. They rescue the girl, and the car explodes behind them. When they attempt to get supplies to bandage the injured girl, a policeman stops them, having locked up the place, but agrees to let them in when the girl identifies him as a \\"man with a purple mark\\". Once inside however, the policeman suddenly attempts to kill the girl. Michael engages in a long battle with him, only for the latter to overwhelm with superior fighting skills. Carrie saves Michael from being strangled by stabbing the policeman with a shard of glass, causing him to choke on his blood and suffocate. Carrie is left disgusted at Michael, and viewing him as cold-blooded killer, but Michael counters that it was \\"him or us\\". Aliens target Robin's house, and he, Dana, and Vincent barely evade alien patrol ships. Robin and Vincent go out to steal a car, and Dana is left alone in the house, where she is apparently stalked by a spotter ship. She is saved by soldiers Kenny and Sam who shoot the ship down with a rocket launcher. The group reunites and heads off to George's house when the deranged tramp appears and confronts them with a pistol and says that they are protecting the Devil. Michael tries to reason with him, but the soldiers shoot the tramp dead as the tramp accidentally kills Robin. The group drives to George's house, where they become convinced that alien infiltrators are hiding among humans, identifiable via a purple mark. The group learns from the girl that the policeman they encountered earlier was one of them and had tried to kill the girl because she knew too much. George reveals that he has monitoring the situation with a special transmitter, supposedly alien in origin, and states that no one would know if it was happening. He concludes that they should only trust people that they know. The group turns on Carrie, for whom none of them can vouch and because the tramp had been pointing his gun at her. Michael convinces the others to allow him to privately inspect Carrie for a purple mark. As they enter the room, Michael confesses that he was dishonourably discharged, something he had neglected to tell anyone, even his friends. He states that he doesn't want to believe she is an alien but that he needs her to prove it, when Carrie abruptly shoots him dead with his own gun. Carrie fights off Sam, Kenny, and George who arrive to stop her, displaying the same combat skills that Michael had used earlier and survives a point blank shot from George's shotgun. She then takes Dana hostage and escapes outside George's house. Kenny follows her into a barn and shoots her just as she is teleported aboard a ship. George attempts to mollify the aliens by offering alien technology that he owns, but they disintegrate him. Kenny and Sam attack the UFO with automatic rifles, but their weapons seem to have no effect. As they wait to be disintegrated, another UFO attacks and destroys that one. The sky fills with two different kinds of UFOs, which attack each other. Sam is killed in the crossfire, and the others retreat back to George's house. On his television, they see a newsreader in the form of Carrie announce that humanity has won the war and people should return to their homes. Vincent attempts to rape Dana, and Kenny savagely beats him and threatens to kill him. Before he can, an alien infiltration team led by a duplicate of the policeman breaks in and reports that there is a young girl there who can identify them. A series of flashbacks reveals there were several other copies of him who have followed the group and were presumably used as infiltrators. In the last scene, the infiltration team receives a go-ahead to kill everyone in the house, and their screams are heard over the radio. In the depths of outer space, the battle between the two alien factions rages on, as the mothership begins to descend.

The church is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The parish can trace its history back to 1830s German immigrants. The first church was built in 1843 and its current structure was built in 1857. The community of Johnsburg grew up around the church which now includes a school, cemetery, and rectory. History Interior Immigrants from Prussia began settling in the Holyland region of Wisconsin in the 1830s. They began holding religious services in settler's huts with services conducted by Father Theodore Van den Broek.Blied, page 26-27 Members donated 2 acres of land for a permanent site and a small log church was built over the middle of 1843. Father Pete Carabin was appointed the first permanent pastor but he did not take residence.Blied, page 28 The Archdiocese of Milwaukee was formed in 1843; the church has remained in the archdiocese since.Blied page 29 Newly appointed Bishop John Henni, a Swiss native, visited the church and parishioners were excited to be addressed using their native German language. An 1844 census of the church showed 40 registered families. The Bishop named Father Caspar Rehrl the first resident pastor in September 1845.Blied, page 30 All land within from Lake Winnebago had been purchased by settlers or was owned by Native Americans and parishioners built a church on the large hill in Mount Calvary which is now the home of the St. Lawrence Seminary High School.Blied, page 38-40 Father Fabian Bermadinger arrived from Austria (along with three Brothers) to assist Rehrl in 1847.Blied, page 41 Wisconsin became a state in 1848. By 1850 the small log church was not large enough. Parishioners initially considered enlarging the log church, but the idea was struck in favor of building a new structure.Blied, page 43 A proposal to build a new structure to the south divided the parish. Father Rehrl resigned and moved to Mount Calvary. Father Bermadinger decided to leave to build a new church in nearby Marytown as its first resident pastor. Father Leo Susan was pastor for about one year and he was replaced by Father John Obermueller. When he arrived in 1851, the parish had 200 families.Blied, page 44 The final decision to build a new stone structure to the south was made and 5 acres was donated by a parishioner. Other parishioners disapproved and Bishop Henni came to arbitrate. Some disagreeing parishioners began building a rival stone church at the old location using $700 that one of the Brothers had been willed for a new church.Blied, page 45 The bishop didn't recognize the new structure and work stopped when the money ran out with just walls completed. Father Obermueller was frustrated with situation and resigned in October 1853. The parish went without a priest until August 1854 when Father Michael Deisenrieder arrived.Blied, page 46 He started gathering materials from nearby quarries and Bishop Henni laid the cornerstone of the church by mid-1855. The church was built from very hard limestone without an architect or contractor. The church took over two full years to build. The disagreeing parishioners refuse to support the new church and some other members were too poor to contribute. A two-story school was built at the same time.Blied, page 47 The church was completed in 1857 and a festival was held which included consecrating the new sacred building. Several families built near the church and the community of Johnsburg was started. Fr. Deisenrieder had a post office established and the town received its original name Heinzburg to honor his birthplace in Bavaria.Blied, page 50 Deisenrieder submitted the annual financial report showing a $1,800 loss (in a depressed economy) and resigned from the parish after receiving hostilities causing his assistant Father Maximilian Mueller to become the head pastor in mid-1857. Mueller was weak from illness and brought in a missionary to preach in February 1858.Blied, page 51 He stopped administering in June 1858 and died on July 12 at age 33. The parish became more peaceful and a series of part-time Capuchin priests preached at the church. Bishop Henni named Father F.X. Pfaller as the full-time pastor in 1861; he remained until May 1862.Blied, page 52 He was the first in a series of priests to preach for one year. Father Aloys Kieser was the preacher from 1866 until 1873. Bishop Henni sold the land that the original church had been built upon; he added the conditions that the cemetery remain intact at that the incomplete church be razed by April 1, 1874.Blied, page 55 Several priests administered the parish until Father Julius Hellweger took over in April 1879. As of 1980, he had the longest administration in the churches' history.Blied, page 57 He left Germany to avoid Otto von Bismarck's persecution of Catholics called the \\"Kulturkampf.\\" Fr. Hellweger had several changes done. The interior was plastered since the original stone had only been whitewashed. A vaulted ceiling was installed, new flooring was laid, and stained glass windows were added. Equipment was added, including a new confessional, higher altar, and a sanctuary lamp. The church celebrated its silver jubilee in 1882 and it installed a new roof and heating system.Blied, page 58 In 1884 a new two-story school was built from cream-colored brick at the site of the previous school and it was completed in 1886. In 1889 he raised funds for a pipe organ and then a metal fence to surround the property.Blied, page 59 Archbishop Frederick Katzer visited in 1892 and urged parishioners to build a new tower. Milwaukee architect Robert Messmer was hired and the new tower was completed by 1894. Hellweger left on a European vacation in February 1899 and returned in August to find that his substitute has left and the parish was in disarray; he left shortly thereafter.Blied, page 61 The parish council was supposed to incorporate the parish by the archbishop's order since 16 years had passed since Wisconsin had required it. A rectory was built in 1905 or 1906.Blied, page 62 The parish was named an outpost of the Milwaukee archdiocese at the same time when diocese lines in the state were redrawn along county lines because of the addition of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Superior. The incorporation issue came up again at the end of the 1900s decade.Blied, page 63 After being closed for a short while, the incorporation papers where finally signed on November 12, 1909 by Father Francis Ruhmann and two representatives from the state of Wisconsin.Blied, page 64 A tide of anti- German patriotism swept the United States during World War I but parish men voted 40 to 34 in favor of keeping sermons in German.Blied, page 66 The parish was able to afford limited enhancements during the Great Depression including a tile floor in the sanctuary, a tabernacle, two statues, two furnaces in the school, and a garage for the rectory.Blied, page 67 Father Benjamin Blied took over administration in 1948 after being a professor at St. Francis Seminary.Blied, page 70 During Blied's tenure, he contracted having a deeper well, automatic bells were added, the old school was razed and converted into a playground, a heater powerful enough for the church and school was installed.Blied, pages 70 to 73 On John the Baptist's day in 1957, the church building's centennial was celebrated with a mass. Numerous priests who were sons of the parish had active roles in the celebration, which was led by archbishop Albert Gregory Meyer.Blied, page 74 Later that year, improvements were made including: the school yard and church approaches were asphalted, steeple repainted and its clock removed in favor of windows, and the church floors tiled. Blied left to teach college at Marian College in 1960 and was succeeded by Rev. Robert Bier.Blied, page 80 The school was being taught by nuns and they wanted to move their housing out of the school into a separate convent to alleviate overcrowding in the school. After approving the concept in 1961, it took until late 1963 to finalize plans since there was issues with how to design an adequate sewage system.Blied, pages 80 to 84 After the school was completed, the New Holstein School District rented two rooms at the school for five years. Parishioners realized that other Catholic private grade schools in the school district were having difficulty attracting non-nun school teachers. A series of meetings were organized and state officials spoke about school funding. Four schools were combined; Marytown, St. Cloud, Mount Calvary were combined with Johnsburg; St. Joe declined.Blied, pages 84 to 87 St. Anna was interested to join since its school was being closed but wasn't invited to the first meeting since it was in a different diocese; the organization decided to decline since it arrived too late in the planning. No name could be decided for new school so the treasurer eventually had checks created using the name \\"Consolidated Parochial Elementary School\\" and the name stuck.Blied, page 88 Marytown and Johnsburg students in Grades 4 to 8 were taught at Johnsburg starting with the 1969-70 school year.

The first recorded Protestant services in town were led by a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. David S. McComb in 1851. First Presbyterian Church was chartered on December 23, 1883 with 11 members. The Rev. Harvey S. Dickey served as their first pastor. They initially worshiped in homes until they built this church building in 1889. An addition was constructed onto the rear of the building in 1915 as the congregation grew. They continued to worship here until 1972 when lack of numbers forced them to dissolve. Templar Lodge No.514 took over the building at that point and used it until December 14, 1977. The West Bend Historical Society acquired the building and used it for a museum from 1981 until 2007. The building is considered a rare example of a wood-frame Late Victorian church. The exterior suggests a vernacular form created by a local craftsman. It utilizes religious symbolism as decorative elements, such as the triangular hoods on the windows and doors that refer to the Holy Trinity. The narthex on the interior reflects the Victorian period of its construction, while the sanctuary reflects the Classical influences popular when the 1915 addition was constructed.

She made eight trips for the East India Company (EIC) before she was sold. She then continued to trade. She made two trips carrying convicts from England to Australia, one as an East Indiaman in 1791, and a second in 1800. On this second voyage as a convict transport she was present at a notable naval action. East Indiaman Royal Admiral made eight voyages for the EIC. Voyage #1 (1778-90) On her first voyage, Captain Joseph Huddart sailed her from Portsmouth on 27 April 1778. She reached Madeira on 27 May, the Cape of Good Hope (Cape) on 24 August, Anjengo in January 1779, and finally Bombay on 7 February. On the return trip she was back at Madeira on 21 August, and in the Downs on 13 January 1780.British Library: Royal Admiral (1). Voyage #2 (1780-83) Huddart and Royal Admiral left Portsmouth on 3 June 1780. She reached Rio de Janeiro on 28 August, Anjengo on 16 January 1781, Goa on 29 January, and Bombay on 14 February. She then spent months on the coasts of India and in the Indian Ocean. On 8 May she was at Tellicherry, then on 26 May Cuddalore, and on 4 June Negapatam. From there she went to Madras, arriving on 26 June, 'Jaggernaickpuram' on 18 July, Masulipatam on 7 August, and returning to Madras on 28 August. She was again at Negapatam on 12 October, and Anjengo on 9 December, Tellicherry on 15 December, Bombay on 31 December, Tellicherry again on 30 April 1782, and Bombay for the last time on this voyage on 28 May. From there she reached St Helena on 31 January 1783 and the Downs on 25 August. Capt. Joseph Huddart, in a Chinese reverse glass painting from c. 1785–9. Voyage #3 (1784-86) Huddart left the Downs on 26 March 1784, reaching St Helena on 8 June, and Bombay on 19 September. From Bombay Royal Admiral sailed to Tellicherry, arriving 25 November, and to Anjengo, arriving on 9 December, before returning to Bombay, which she reached on 29 December. She then sailed to China via Malacca, which she reached on 13 June 1785, before arriving on 8 July at Whampoa. For her return to Britain she crossed Second Bar on 18 October, reached St Helena on 17 February 1786, and the Downs on 27 April. Voyage #4 (1787-88) Huddart sailed Royal Admiral from the Downs on 20 January 1787. She reached Trinidade on 12 March, and Madras on 22 May. Her next stop, on 27 July, was Penang. From there she arrived at Whampoa on 21 September. For her return to Britain she crossed Second Bar 18 January 1788, reached St Helena on 2 May, and arrived at the Downs on 3 July. Voyage #5 (1790-91) Captain Essex Henry Bond took command of Royal Admiral for her next three voyages. She left the Downs on 17 April 1790 and arrived at Whampoa on 26 August. She crossed Second Bar on 31 January 1791, reached the Cape on 9 April, St Helena seventeen days later, and the Downs on 26 June. Voyage #6 (1792-93) Again under Bond's command, she sailed from Torbay, England, on 30 May 1792, with 299 male and 49 female convicts. She reached the Cape on 9 August. One male convict escaped at the Cape, but one convict escapee from the Pitt, the convicted forger and future Australian artist Thomas Watling, was transported on board after the Dutch had recaptured him. Royal Admiral arrived in Port Jackson, New South Wales on 7 October 1792. Ten male and two female convicts had died during the voyage; four children were born.Bateson (1959), pp.123 & 128. Royal Admiral left Port Jackson on 13 November, bound for China. After leaving Port Jackson Royal Admiral arrived at Whampoa on 14 January 1793. On the return trip to Britain she reached Bocca Tigris on 18 March and St Helena on 16 June, and arrived at the Downs on 21 August. Voyage #7 (1794-95) Royal Admiral was almost rebuilt in 1794. Her next voyage, the seventh, began during the French Revolutionary War, and as was standard practice for the EIC, on 13 June 1794 Bond received a letter of marque. Royal Admiral left Plymouth on 14 August. She reached Madeira on 5 September, the Cape on 28 November, and Diamond Harbour on 20 February 1795. On her homeward bound leg she reached Saugor on 26 April, Madras on 18 July, Trincomalee on 12 August, St Helena on 7 November, and the Downs on 16 March 1796. Voyage #8 (1796-98) Captain William Dorset Fellowes commanded Royal Admiral on her eighth voyage, and received a letter of marque on 8 June 1796. She left Portsmouth on 11 August 1796 and reached the Cape on 18 November. She arrived at Kedgeree on 28 February 1797 and Diamond Harbour on 21 March. On 1 July she was again at Kedgeree, on 21 July at Ganjam, on 9 August at Madras, on 8 October at Diamond Harbour, and on 14 October at Calcutta. The reason for the to-and-fro, was that the British government planned to mount an expedition against Manila in 1797–8. (One of the Royal Navy vessels involved appears to have been HMS Sybille.) The EIC held eight regular ships and three \\"dismantled ships\\" to support the expedition: Pitt, Lascalles, and Royal Admiral. None of the three went to Penang, but instead went to the Coromandel Coast with stores and back to Bengal. A peace treaty with Spain resulted in the British cancelling the expedition. The EIC detained Pitt and Royal Admiral for an average of a year, though Pitt appears to have spent less time than that. The owners claimed demurrage; for Royal Admiral, the amount they claimed was £8,568 15s for 250 days.The Asiatic annual register or a view of the history of Hindustan and of the politics, commerce and literature of Asia, Volume 7 (1805), pp.53-60. The captains involved sued the EIC for expenses, though Fellowes did not. The court further ordered that the officers of the vessels involved receive some payment. Royal Admiral's officers received £200 in all, with Fellowes receiving £40, her purser £16, and the other officers intermediate amounts. Fellowes received by far the smallest amount of any of the 11 captains involved. For her return to Britain, Royal Admiral reached Saugor on 27 January 1798, the Cape on 28 May, St Helena on 29 June, and the Downs on 18 October. In 1799 her owners sold Royal Admiral to Gillett & Co., of Calcutta. Gillett and Co. wanted her for the local trade in India. Botany Bay ship Royal Admiral first appears in the Lloyd's Register for 1800 with William Wilson as captain and Gillet & Co. as owners, destination Botany Bay, and her age is given as 23 years old. She appears among the list of vessels sailing for the EIC, but as a separate listing from the above.British Library: Royal Admiral (2). She also does not appear in the Hardy & Hardy (1811) list of vessels serving the EIC between 1760 and 1810, indicating that the EIC had sold her. She sailed from Portsmouth on 23 May 1800,Bateson (1959), pp.152-3. under a letter of marque issued to Wilson on 10 February 1800. She was carrying 300 male convicts.Bateson (1959), p.153. She was also carrying 11 missionaries and had undertaken to deliver them to the South Sea islands after having delivered her convicts. She was one of the vessels in the convoy at the Action of 4 August 1800, when and the East Indiaman captured the French frigates Concorde and Médée.Lloyd's List, 16 January 1801 - accessed 11 November 2013. Royal Admiral arrived at Rio on 12 August. Lloyd's List reported in January 1801 that the Botany Bay ship Royal Admiral had been at Rio de Janeiro, having sailed in company with several ships of the East India Company. On the way, 23 prisoners, her surgeon Samuel Turner, four seamen, a convict's wife, and a convict's child had died. Royal Admiral reached Port Jackson, New South Wales, on 20 November.Bateson (1959), p.139. Forty-three male convicts had died during the voyage. She left Port Jackson on 23 March, bound for China. She reached the Barrier Islands on 21 April and left them on 17 June, reaching Tahiti on 10 July. From there she sailed on 2 August, the reaching Whampoa on 23 August. For her return to Britain, she crossed Second Bar on 22 December, reaching the Cape on 30 March 1802. She stopped at St Helena on 30 April, and arrived at the Downs on 2 July. Royal Admiral last appears in Lloyd's Register in 1807, still with Wilson as captain, Gillet & Co. as owner, and London-Botany Bay as her destinations.

Since the beginning of commercial alligator farming in the United States, Australia, South Africa and South East Asia, crocodile fat became a commercial product that can be used in a number of ways, including medicine and as a feedstock for biodiesel. Energy use Alligator fat was recently identified as a source to produce biodiesel. Every year, about 15 million pounds of alligator fat are disposed of in landfills as a waste byproduct of the alligator meat and skin industry. Studies have shown that biodiesel produced from alligator fat is similar in composition to biodiesel created from soybeans, and is cheaper to refine since it is primarily a waste product. Biodiesel made of crocodile fat can be utilized by cars. A research work was published in Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research Journal.Srividya Ayalasomayajula, Ramalingam Subramaniam, August Gallo, Stephen Dufreche, Mark Zappi, and Rakesh Bajpai. Potential of Alligator Fat as Source of Lipids for Biodiesel Production. Publication Date (Web): July 15, 2011 The authors show that recovery of lipids from the alligator fat tissue was studied by solvent extraction as well as by microwave rendering. Microwave rendering resulted in oil recovery of 61% by weight of the frozen fat tissue obtained from producers. The fatty acid profile of the lipid showed that palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), and oleic acid (C18:1) were the dominant fatty acids accounting for 89–92% of all lipids by mass; 30% of the fatty acids were saturated and 70% were unsaturated. The biodiesel produced from alligator oil was found to meet the ASTM specifications of biodiesel concerning kinematic viscosity, sulfur, free and total glycerin, flash point, cloud point, and acid number. The head of the research team Brahal Bajpai and his crew assessed that a large crocodile farm would produce biodiesel made out of crocodile fat at $2.51 a gallon, excluding the cost of the fat and transportation. The latter cost would presumably be $0, since it is a waste product anyway. Such a price would make it competitive with petroleum-derived diesel.The New York Times.

He produced work that was featured in postcards and numerous publications while he was still alive, and that continues to be exhibited and receive recognition long after his death. Beyond work, Underhill was a long-time member of the Rotary Club of New York, and President of the Underhill Society of America. Biography Irving Underhill was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on November 11, 1872. He was the son of William James Underhill (1836–1895), a produce commission merchant, who married Louise Prince of Flushing, New York. They had several children, of which Irving Underhill was the youngest. Irving Underhill opened his photography business in 1896, and provided artistic portraits, city views and panoramas, group photographs, marine, legal, and machinery photography. He married Laura Davison on February 16, 1898. Irving was a photographer in New York City and served in the New Jersey National Guard. By 1922 his studio was in an impressive building on the corner of Broadway and Park Place. Incidentally, this building has since been lost and replaced by a skyscraper. In 1928 his residence was 277 Harrison Ave., Jersey City, New Jersey. Underhill was a member of the Rotary Club of New York among several other organizations. He received special recognition for his 25 years as a Rotary Club member in 1938. Underhill was present at the funeral of Pirie MacDonald, another professional photographer and Rotarian in 1942. Highlights of artistic output and recognition Irving Underhill, Luna Park and Surf Avenue, Coney Island, 1912. Gelatin dry glass plate negative. Brooklyn Museum Irving Underhill, Manhattan Bridge Construction 1909 Underhill took a particular interest in capturing the cityscape, landmarks, tall buildings, and nautical scenes. In 1911 Woolworth hired Underhill - whose studio directly fronted the building site - to document the construction of the Woolworth Building at regularly timed intervals. The photographs were then mailed to store managers throughout the country and abroad, with the recommendation that they be distributed and published as \\"widely as possible.\\" Another self-published work that was a promotional piece in collaboration with the Hudson River Day Line was entitled The Hudson River: photo-gravures. He was enlisted in the Prohibition with photographs from a Federal Prohibition Laboratory that accompanied a 1926 New York Times article, showing shelves and shelves of liquor. Irving Underhill was particularly adept at showing the juxtaposition of old pedestrian-scaled buildings and newer skyscrapers that seemed to dominate the older city. Such was the case with one photo of the Trinity Church Spire, shown against the new fifty-story 1 Wall Street at Broadway and Wall, which in 1931 was said to be the most costly plot of real estate in the entire world. Underhill also photographed the rise of the Empire State Building. In an article celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Architectural League of New York, in 1931, an article in The New York Times entitled \\"From Roofs to Towers and Slats\\", prominently featured a photograph Irving Underhill. This photograph showed the skyline below City Hall Park at the beginning of the century, to symbolize the passing of an era before tall buildings began to dominate the cityscape. In 1982, a book entitled New York, photographs, 1850-1950 featured some of Underhill's work, particular his photo of Columbus Circle between 58th and 60th Streets. A photo of the Woolworth Building in 1913 made shortly after construction was completed was highlighted in a 1993 New York Times article. Charles Hagen compared this photo with an etching from John Marin about the same time, and wrote \\"Irving Underhill's photo, made the same year, offers a more sober depiction of the building's Gothic forms than Marin's giddy impression, but records it with a mixture of down-to-earth factuality and pride.\\" Irving Underhill's work was displayed along with Berenice Abbott's in 1993 exhibition by the Museum of the City of New York entitled \\"New York Saved: 30 Years of Landmarks Preservation.\\" The exhibition displayed Underhill's photo of the exterior of Grand Central Terminal in 1919. Still later, a photograph showing the West Street Building and the Singer Tower from the Hudson River, taken by Underhill ca. 1908, was included in a book on Cass Gilbert. The work of Irving Underhill continues to resonate today. A colored postcard of Columbus Circle from 1925, was used in a 2005 New York Times article. His picture of the Manhattan Bridge from a New York Times article in 1909, was highlighted in a 2009 article talking about the same bridge and how it has struggled to earn recognition and respect. Underhill's photo shows the beginning of decking being hung tenuously from the thick and heavy cables overhead. Digitization efforts have brought Underhill's work into the public spotlight once again. The New York Public Library Digital Gallery, includes 249 Items under the name \\"Underhill, Irving\\" in their digital collection available via their website. Likewise, the Museum of the City of New York has 142 results of digitized images available to view in their online collection. The Brooklyn Museum now has 119 Underhill images in their online digital collection. Participation in Underhill Society and other family organizations Irving Underhill's participation in the Underhill Society of America began innocuously enough, serving as a \\"family photographer\\". Over time he became Treasurer between 1906 and 1932 and later President of the Society between 1946 and 1950. When Society President Francis Jay Underhill was travelling through Europe in 1928, Irving Underhill was the recipient of numerous postcards. Irving Underhill applied his photographic talents to Underhill subjects as well, such as in 1931 when he took a photograph of the Myron Charles Taylor residence in Locust Valley. Following the death of Willard Underhill Taylor, his brother Myron Charles Taylor was proposed as a Director for the Underhill Society. Despite actively being involved in affairs of the Underhill Society, Taylor declined. Following the death of John Garrett Underhill, Sr., who served as President of the Underhill Society, Myron Charles Taylor speculated about the possibility of placing the Underhill Society and Underhill Burying Ground under the control of the Nassau County Historical Society. This proposal never transpired. Once again, Irving Underhill reached out to Myron Charles Taylor to become an officer of the Underhill Society, and speculating about the need for protection of the Underhill Westchester Burying Ground. Irving Underhill also served as Treasurer and President of the Westchester Burying Ground. Taylor declined an Officer position again though gave some input on the future of the Society in a letter dated March 23, 1948.

The team formerly competed in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series racing team until 1987, fielding Cale Yarborough during the 1980s late in its operations. The team later became Robert Yates Racing after Yates, an engine builder and crew chief with the operation, bought the team in 1988. The team largely fielded General Motors vehicles for its various drivers until switching to Fords in 1985. The team won the 1980 Daytona 500 with Buddy Baker and 1983 and 1984 Daytona 500 with Yarborough. The team was based in Charlotte and co-operated by Harry Ranier (February 25, 1937July 21, 1999) and J. T. Lundy. who left in 1987 Ranier was a Kentuckian coal mining magnate. Ranier's entry into the sport predates magnates such as J. D. Stacy and Billy Hagan. Cup Series Car No. 28 history =1967–1980= Harry Ranier started entering racecars into NASCAR's top division sporadically starting in 1967 and consistently starting in 1978 with driver Lennie Pond and later Buddy Baker. In 1978, Ranier's team won its first race at the Talladega 500 with Pondhttp://www.motorracingnetwork.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint- Cup/News/Articles/2011/10/MRN-Flashback--Talladega-Triumph.aspx after other key leading cars were slowed when Bill Elliott's car blew a tire and spreading debris. Buddy Baker drove for the team starting in 1979. In 1980, Waddell Wilson was crew chief and engine builder. Baker won the 1980 Daytona 500 for the team in a famous paint scheme known as the \\"gray ghost\\". The car set the record for fastest Daytona 500 ever run by average speed, a record that still stands. =1983–1988= left In 1983, Yarborough moved to the No. 28 Hardee's Chevrolet owned by Harry Ranier, competing in 16 events. He won four races, including his third Daytona 500, his sixth Atlanta Coca-Cola 500, and swept both events at Michigan, along with three poles. In 1984 he repeated by winning his fourth Daytona 500, becoming the second driver to score back-to- back wins, the Winston 500 at Talladega, a race that featured 75 lead changes, and the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500, along with four poles. In 1985 after his team switched to a Ford, he won his first Talladega 500 and scored his final win in the Miller High Life 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. =1987–1988= Prior to the 1987 season, car owner Ranier tapped Davey Allison to replace veteran driver Cale Yarborough in the Ranier-Lundy No. 28 Ford Thunderbird. Yarborough was leaving the Ranier-Lundy team to start his own operation along with the team's sponsor, Hardee's. Ranier negotiated a sponsorship deal with Texaco's Havoline motor oil brand, a deal that was signed during the Speedweeks at Daytona International Speedway. He also hired Robert Yates as his engine builder and Joey Knuckles as the No. 28's crew chief, who paired with Allison for years. On qualifying day, Allison signalled that he was in Winston Cup to stay when he qualified an unmarked, but Texaco-Havoline painted No. 28 Thunderbird second for the 1987 Daytona 500, becoming the first rookie ever to start on the front row for NASCAR's most prestigious event. A pit miscue which allowed a rear tire to fall off on the track ended his hopes of a good finish in the race, but success for Davey Allison would be just around the corner. Allison drove full time in the Texaco/Havoline #28 for Ranier in 1987 and 1988. Ranier sold his team to Yates on October 1, 1988, prior to the 1989 season. Allison would have most of his success driving for Yates Racing. Ranier did not field a car again until the fall of 1996. Car No. 20 history After staying out of the Cup Series for eight years, Ranier fielded a Cup entry with Elton Sawyer driving the new #20 in the 1996 season finale at the Atlanta Motor Speedway. Rainer back moved to Cup full time in 1997 with former partner Hardee's returning to sponsor the new #20 and Greg Sacks driving the car. However, after missing several early-season races, the team switched to part time, and eventually Hardees left the team and it shut down. Busch Series Car No. 15 history Ranier returned to run a limited schedule in the 1996 Busch Series with IRL star Tony Stewart driving the No. 15. The team had sponsorship from Mariah Entertainment for the first two events of a nine race schedule, running the rest unsponsored. Stewart had a best finish of 16th at Bristol. The Ranier Busch Series team shut down after the season. Truck Series For the operations after the 2016 season, see MDM Motorsports Truck No. 71 history On February 4, 2016, MDM-Hillman Racing joined Lorin Ranier to create a driver development team that would compete in, among other series, the Camping World Truck Series. A selection of Richard Childress Racing development drivers were scheduled to run a partial season in the No. 99 Chevrolet, with funding from the drivers' other sponsors. After rain cancelled qualifying at Dover, the team made a deal to run Dover and the rest of Ranier/MDM's 2016 schedule in the No. 71 Chevrolet, leasing owners points from Carlos Contreras. Brandon Jones and Austin Dillon split the Truck for six races. Truck No. 99 history Ranier Racing/MDM was supposed to field the No. 99 in six Truck races in 2016, however the truck was renumbered to No. 71 after leasing owners points from Contreras Motorsports. In 2017, the No. 99 truck returned but since Ranier and Miller parted ways the team starting in 2017 and beyond is called MDM Motorsports. K&N; Pro Series / ARCA Racing Series In 2015, Ranier Racing with MDM partner with Hillman Racing to field two cars (No. 40 and No. 41) in both K&N; Pro Series East and K&N; Pro Series West. The team returned for 2016. In 2017, the team shut down because Ranier/Hillman and Miller part ways. Miller renamed the team to MDM Motorsports. Austin Dillon, Landon Cassill, Ryan Preece, Kyle Benjamin, Travis Miller, Brian Wong, Corey LaJoie and Spencer Davis all drove for the team in K&N.; The team also fielded two part-time entries (the No. 8 and No. 28) in ARCA Racing Series' 2016 season, the team had 1 win with Brandon Jones at Michigan. The team also had 1 pole-position with Kyle Benjamin at Iowa. Alongside Jones and Benjamin, Harrison Burton, Travis Miller, Matt Tifft and Michael Self also drove for the team in ARCA.

The structure was completed in 1864. History The music about the church was written by Dr. William S. Pitts in 1857 following a coach ride that stopped in Bradford, Iowa. The church is in a valley near the town, though the church was not actually built until several years later. In the years since, the church has become known simply as \\"the Little Brown Church\\". When Pitts returned to the area with his wife in 1862 he discovered a church being erected where he imagined it. The congregation had been meeting in various temporary spaces until Rev. J.K. Nutting led the drive to create a permanent home for the congregation. During this period, Pitts had been teaching singing at nearby Bradford Academy and taught his class to sing his song for the first time at the dedication of the church in 1864. Pitts later sold the rights to the song for a nominal sum. After the church closed in 1888 due to economic downturn in the town, the Society For the Preservation of the Little Brown Church was founded. By 1914, services were again held in the building. Shortly afterward, the small congregation experienced a revival that attracted new attention to it and to its song. Among those who found and loved the song at this time was the Weatherwax Quartet. This group of traveling singers traveled throughout Canada and the United States in the 1920s and '30s and used as their trademark song \\"The Church in the Wildwood.\\" They would quite easily talk about the little church during their travels. As the song grew in popularity, coupled with the development of the U.S. Highway system in the mid-1920s, many visitors came to the newly reopened little church. Since then the church has become a popular tourist spot, and remains so today. It attracts thousands of visitors every year to see or be married in the \\"little brown church in the vale.\\" The church is currently a member of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches.

He is the Vice-President of Prosthetics for Hanger Clinic, a prosthetics and orthotics provider in the United States. Kevin travels around the United States and the world providing care for patients with unique or challenging cases and for disabled athletes. He also presents scientific symposiums and educational programs. Carroll is one of the most renowned prosthetists in the world. He is an American Board Certified Prosthetist and has been named a Fellow of the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists. He is a member of the International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics (ISPO), the British Association of Prosthetics and Orthotics (BAPO) and the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers. In 2009 Carroll was awarded the Distinguished Service Award by the United States Sports Academy because of his contributions to the advancement of prosthetics and his dedication to numerous disabled and Paralympic athletes. Winter the dolphin In 2005, a baby dolphin (now named Winter) became entangled in the ropes of a crab trap. The rope cut off the supply of blood to her tail which resulted in her tail being amputated. It was thought that Winter would learn to swim without a tail, but this forced her to swim with a \\"side to side\\" motion instead of the normal \\"up and down\\" motion. Winter's veterinarians feared that this unusual movement would damage her spine. Kevin Carroll, who had previously designed prosthetics for other animals (including dogs, an ostrich and a duck), volunteered to help after hearing about Winter on NPR and became Winter's prosthetist in 2005. Kevin and a team of experts, including Hanger clinician Dan Strzempka, began working on creating a prosthetic tail for Winter. While Carroll thought that it would be a simple task, the project took over a year and a half before Winter began wearing the tail. The successful creation of an artificial tail fluke is the first time a full prosthetic tail has been created for a dolphin. Carroll and Strzempka worked with a chemical engineer to develop WintersGel, a new material that would disperse pressure evenly onto the dolphin's skin. Now the material is used for human amputees including Brian Kolfage and Megan McKeon. 2009 book In 2009 Winter's story was told by Craig Hatkoff and his daughters Juliana and Isabella Hatkoff, the No. 1 New York Times best- selling children's authors in Winter's Tail: How One Little Dolphin Learned to Swim Again. The book was published by Turtle Pond Publications and Scholastic. The book was co-released with a Nintendo DS game. 2011 film In 2011, Winter's story hit the big screen when American film director Charles Martin Smith directed the film Dolphin Tale. Carroll and Strzempka served as consultants for the movie and are featured at the end credits along with Megan McKeon and others who have benefited from Winter. For reasons unknown concerning the historical liberties, Carroll and Strzempka's roles were merged into one character for the film, Dr. Cameron McCarthy who is played by actor Morgan Freeman. On the Blu-ray + DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy version of the movie, Carroll and Strzempka are featured in Winter's Inspiration, the featurette that shares Winter's true story. Warren Macdonald In 1997 Warren Macdonald, an Australian mountain climber, was climbing through a remote mountainside in Australia when a one-ton boulder fell onto his legs trapping him for 45 hours. This trauma resulted in both of his legs being amputated mid-thigh. After his rehabilitation, he returned to climbing using speciality climbing prostheses developed by Kevin Carroll and Hanger clinician Chad Simpson.

It is native to the Chihuahuan Desert of North America, where it occurs in the US states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, and the Mexican states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, San Luis Potosí, and Zacatecas. Most of the species in the genus are found in Latin America; this and F. pringlei are the only two species whose ranges extend into the United States.Innes, Robin J. 2010. Flourensia cernua. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory.SEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, New Mexico Biodiversity Portal - Flourensia cernua includes photos, description, distribution map Flourensia cernua is a shrub growing from a network of roots that may extend four meters (over 13 feet) horizontally. Most are shallow but a few extend up to five meters (over 16 feet) deep into the soil. It usually grows to a maximum height of about one meter (40 inches), but can be as tall as two meters (7 feet).Flourensia cernua. Flora of North America. It may grow erect or spreading in shape. It has many branches, branching from the base of the stem. The branches are covered in alternately arranged thick, oval leaves up to in length, sometimes reaching . The edges of the leaf blades are smooth or wavy. The hanging flower heads contain several yellow disc florets and no ray florets. The fruit is a hairy achene up to a long including its pappus. Most of the parts of the plant are very resinous and have a tarlike or hoplike scent. It has a bitter taste. Flourensia cernua is winter-deciduous in most regions, but may retain its leaves in areas with sufficient moisture. The production of leaves is affected by moisture levels; the plant has been observed to produce a first set of small, scalelike leaves during a dry spring and a second set of larger leaves later in the season as moisture increases. Growth occurs earlier in the year when rainfall is abundant. Flowering occurs in the fall. The plant generally produces few flowers in dry years. The root network is shallow and vast with a few very deep roots, helping it collect water from a wide area of soil, another adaptation to its dry habitat. Flourensia cernua grows in desert scrub and desert grassland. It has increased in abundance in these habitats during recent times as a result of overgrazing, which reduced the native grasses, particularly grama grasses and tobosa. It is an indicator of Chihuahuan Desert scrub, which covers about 70% of the Chihuahuan Desert. There it codominates with creosotebush and viscid acacia. Other common plants associated with tarbush include whitethorn acacia, catclaw acacia, honey mesquite, Berlandier wolfberry, mariola, Wright's beebrush, littleleaf sumac, broom snakeweed, winterfat, and smooth-leaf sotol. It is part of many plant communities and is dominant in many types of desert habitats and ecotones. It is often the main shrub in a landscape otherwise populated by grasses. It may be sparse or locally abundant, growing scattered about the terrain or in dense stands. It may form monotypic stands in soils of clay and silt, such as those on bottomlands. It is most common on alluvial soils derived from limestone, the main parent material for the soils of the Chihuahuan Desert. The species has been described as long-lived. Flourensia cernua has medicinal uses. In Mexico it is steeped to make a tea that is consumed to treat various gastrointestinal conditions such as indigestion and diarrhea. It is also used for respiratory disorders; its extracts have shown the ability to kill multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro. The leaves and flower heads are sold in farmers' markets in Mexico and the United States. In agriculture, this shrub has been studied as a potential supplemental forage for livestock such as sheep. The fact that it is increasing in abundance in the Chihuahuan Desert has sparked interest in its value as food for local domestic animals. It is similar to alfalfa in nutritional value being high in protein. However, it contains compounds that reduce its palatability to animals, making it bitter and \\"peppery\\". In addition, the flowers and fruits are toxic to sheep, goats, and cattle. Livestock naturally avoid it. The leaves can be consumed in moderation for their nutritional value, but a diet composed only of tarbush can be fatal. Compounds isolated from the plant include flavonoids, sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenoids, acetylenes, p-acetophenones, benzopyrans and benzofurans. Extracts of the plant have shown antifungal, anticyanobacterial, and antitermite effects. A number of the compounds are phytotoxic.

The Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB) is an agency composed of commissioners representing the federal government, the states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The ICPRB mission is to enhance, protect, and conserve the water and associated land resources of the Potomac River basin and its tributaries through regional and interstate cooperation. It was one of the first organizations with a congressional mandate to consider water resources on a watershed basis, rather than along political boundaries.Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, Rockville, MD (2009). \\"ICPRB: Protecting a River, Advancing a Quality of Life.\\" Fact sheet. Authority The Commission was created by an act of the United States Congress in 1940.Seventy-sixth Congress, third session, Public Resolution No. 93. . Approved July 11, 1940. Congress amended the law in 1970, creating an interstate compact., , , September 25, 1970.  Mission  ICPRB accomplishes its mission through a variety of actions to conduct, coordinate, and cooperate in studies and programs in the areas of water quality, water supply, living resources, and land resources. The Section for Cooperative Water Supply Operations on the Potomac River (CO-OP), a special section of the Commission, was created as a technical operations center for management and coordination among the regional utilities to avoid water supply shortages in the Washington metropolitan area during droughts.  Commissioners  The ICPRB Commissioners represent the commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, the states of Maryland and West Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the federal government. These individuals, appointed by their respective jurisdictions, set policy and provide guidance for the Commission, as an interstate compact agency.  Focus Areas  Potomac River watershed Complementing the commissioners is a professional staff that has gained a strong reputation for delivery of sound science and analysis that arms decision-makers at various government levels with the facts and technical data to resolve issues concerning the watershed. The staff efforts focus on four primary areas of involvement: Drinking Water and Water Resources The drinking water and water resources knowledge of the staff is used to coordinate the water supply withdrawals of the three major metropolitan area water utilities that rely on Potomac River water for nearly per day to meet the thirst of the capital region. Throughout the basin, project expertise includes: * Water resources operations and supply modeling * Population and demand forecasting * Flood control and flood forecast systems * Acid mine drainage abatement; passive treatment * Drinking water assessments and source water protection studies * River flow modeling and time of travel studies. * Source water protection * Groundwater * Water supply planning Water Quality Water quality issues addressed by Commission staff include supporting highly complex studies and projects that reap benefits both for the Potomac basin and for the Chesapeake Bay drainage, of which the basin comprises a major part. Project expertise includes: * Stream assessments to determine impairments * Water quality modeling * Sediment transport modeling * Total maximum daily load (TMDL) plans for watersheds. * GIS-based data comparison * Zooplankton and phytoplankton assessments * Wetlands assessment and restoration * Fisheries management * Aquatic habitat assessment/development * Hazardous material (RCRA) assessments Aquatic Life Staff in the aquatic life section of ICPRB work to evaluate and report on biological communities and how they respond to stream, river and estuarine conditions. Staff carefully measure and analyze aquatic life data in the Potomac basin and make management recommendations based on sound scientific data. Working collaboratively with other organizations, staff develop ecosystem indicators and analysis that is consistent basin-wide. Projects include: * Zooplankton and phytoplankton assessments * Restoration of viable American shad and other fisheries populations * Aquatic habitat assessments and redevelopment * Wetlands assessments and restoration * Fisheries management and flow assessments. Communication and Education The agency’s technical expertise is magnified by a communications program that extends the impacts and results of ICPRB’s projects to the region’s public. Work in protecting and improving the region’s resources can be effective only when the public is educated about the reasons for those actions and their role in the preservation of those resources. To that end, the Commission: * Publishes newsletters and reports * Maintains an informational web site * Responds to requests for information * Reaches out to schools, citizen groups, and other organizations * Coordinates watershed groups conducting stream cleanups. Cooperation and partnerships The ICPRB works with numerous partners throughout the basin using cooperative skills for encouraging multiple jurisdictions to coordinate actions on water resource issues. This brings to the watershed needed action to address the basin’s major challenges, including water quality impairments, water supply, flooding, groundwater use, and nonpoint source pollution. The Commission can complete a range of surveys and assessments designed to increase the knowledge of the ecosystem that allows for more efficient resources management. Regional facilitation With the mainstem of the Potomac River forming interstate boundaries, a cooperative, non-regulatory regional organization is well-suited to facilitate solutions. In a basin of nearly , including five principal political jurisdictions and more than five-million residents relying on its water for domestic, industrial and agricultural water supply purposes, a technically skilled agency must assist the multiple interests in solving water resources problems. With more than one-million acres of federally owned or managed land in the basin, the federal government has an interest in the waters of the basin. An agency that provides for coordinated state and federal water resources management actions can accomplish this if properly supported. Such an agency exists in the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin. Timeline of accomplishments 1940s - The Commission's first (1943) report on the condition of Potomac basin waters precipitates adoption of a pollution abatement program (1945), an intensive survey of industrial pollution (1946), and definition of a set of \\"Minimum Water Quality Criteria\\" (1946) by which Potomac streams and waterways may be judged suitable or unsuitable for several principal water uses. Concurrent to Congress enacting the first Federal Water Pollution Control Act (1948), ICPRB initiates a continuous water-quality sampling program in the basin. By 1949, ICPRB is given credit for coordination with local authorities to \\"radically\\" improve conditions on the Potomac's Shenandoah River tributary, recently referred to as a \\"biological desert\\" due to pollution from industrial waste. 1950s - ICPRB issues a major report describing the polluted Washington area Potomac and publishes the results of a study it sponsored on North Branch industrial wastes (1954). Under the auspices of the ICPRB, a group of citizens organizes the Citizens Council for a Clean Potomac (1956). As the U.S. Public Health Service declares the Potomac River unsafe for swimming, ICPRB estimates that on the average, 60 million cubic feet of sediment is deposited annually within the metropolitan Washington reach of the Potomac estuary (1957). Chairman Harold A. Kemp indicates Potomac River pollution has reached a \\"critical condition\\" with urgent need for additional sewage treatment facilities. By 1958, ICPRB is gathering and tabulating information from about 85 stream sampling stations operated by cooperating agencies, municipalities and industries. The following year, ICPRB publishes its first \\"Potomac River Water Quality Network,\\" holds a \\"first-of-its-kind\\" silt control conference and sponsors a study of sediment sources in the basin with the U.S. Geological Survey. 1960s - In 1963, ICPRB issues two reports on sediment sources and an urban sediment control program. 1970s - ICPRB's Compact is amended in 1970, extending its authority to include water supply and water-related land use. In 1975, an ICPRB conference focuses on rising dollar and energy costs associated with Washington, D.C. metro area sewage treatment. 1980s - ICPRB initiates regional discussion of the problem posed by invasive aquatic weed, hydrilla (1983). After Maryland (1985) and the District of Columbia (1986) initiate a phosphate detergent bans, ICPRB recommends (1987) expanding such bans basin-wide. 1990s - Maryland, West Virginia and ICPRB sign (1993) cooperative agreement on program to restore water quality to the North Branch. 2000s– In 2001, the ICPRB combined decades of data into a consistent and usable format for researchers and those working on the watershed in the Tidal Potomac Integrative Analysis Project. In 2002, ICPRB's successful American Shad Restoration Project is completed, restoring the population of this historically significant fish that once flowed freely in the Potomac but had been decimated by pollution, overfishing, and blockage over the past century. In 2004, along with other partners in the basin, the Commission organizes and leads the formation of a voluntary partnership between water utilities and state and federal agencies known as the Potomac River Basin Drinking Water Source Protection Partnership which will focus on protecting the water quality of the river as the source of drinking water for millions of people that live in the basin. ICPRB developed an index of stream health known as Chessie BIBI in 2008. It is calculated from stream macroinvertebrate samples collected and counted by state, federal, and local agencies and other groups. 2010s - In 2011, scientists at ICPRB conduct a survey of freshwater mussels in the mainstem of the River. These sensitive creatures are good indicators of a healthy waterway. Having baseline information can help determine the future shifts in water quality. The Potomac River Basin Comprehensive Water Resources Plan is adopted in 2018. The plan describes a shared vision for the basin, identifies water resources issues of interstate and/or basin wide significance, and recommends actions for achieving the shared vision.

(now O.F.M.), was an Italian Franciscan friar, who went to the United States in 1855 to help establish the Order there. He was responsible for the establishment of major institutions of the Order in the Northeastern United States. He founded two religious institutes of Sisters of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis. Early career Little is known of Pamfilo's life prior to his admission into the Franciscan Order, other than that he was born Giovanni Paulo Pietrobattista on either 12 or 22 April 1824, in the village of Magliano de' Marsi, which is in the Province of L'Aquila in the mountainous Abruzzo region of central Italy. At that time it was under the rule of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Pietrobattista grew up in a parish administered by the Friars Minor and frequented their church. When he was of age, on 5 July 1839, he entered the Province of St. Bernadine of Siena, based in Urbino, taking the name Pamfilo (possibly after St. Pamphilus of Sulmona). He was ordained a Catholic priest in Urbino on 18 December 1846. After his ordination, he was given Chairs in both philosophy and theology at the Order's friary there. He taught there until October 1852, when he was sent to Rome to serve as secretary to the Visitor General of the Order. On 8 December of that year, he began to teach at one of the Order's institutions of higher learning, the Irish College of St. Isidore, where he was able to perfect his command of English. He remained in this post until 4 January 1855. Foundations in America At this point, in response to an invitation by John Timon, Bishop of Buffalo, seeking help in providing pastoral care to the European immigrants moving in large numbers to his territory, Pamfilo was sent to the United States by the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor to establish their presence in the country. The friars received the personal blessing of Pope Pius IX on 22 May 1855, before their departure. They set sail for New York City, where they arrived on 20 June. He proceeded to lead his small band of friars in establishing a friary and an academy in Allegany, NY in Western New York. By 1859, he was one of 14 founding friars who established St. Bonaventure College, which was to become St. Bonaventure University, and he was appointed as its first President. The academy drew young men who felt a religious calling to the Order, and with time Pamfilo was able to establish several communities of friars. When the sufficient number of communities with professed friars had been established, in 1861, with the permission of the Holy See, the Minister General established a Custody of the Order, named Immaculate Conception, for the recently defined dogma of the Church. Pamfilo was named Custos, the first regional Superior of the Order in the United States, and thus a significant step in the rooting of the Order in the nation. Under his leadership, the friars assumed the administration of two parishes in New York City, St. Francis of Assisi and St. Anthony of Padua in 1866. Both of these are still served by Franciscan friars. Father Founder In his position as Custos, Father Pamfilo was effectively the leader of the Franciscan Order in the nation in its various branches. In addition to the establishment of the friars, he also worked to support and guide the communities of women of the Third Order of St. Francis, who were springing up around the country to help educate the children of the Catholic immigrants flooding into the nation. To this end, in 1857 he recruited Mary Jane Todd to commit herself as a Sister of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis. He gave her the religious habit and professed her as a member of the Order. When other women came to join her, he acted as the Superior General of the new foundation, until they were able to establish themselves as an independent congregation, known as the Franciscan Sisters of Allegany. They worked to educate young women of western New York State. From there, their work has spread throughout the world. Likewise, in 1863 Magliano helped in the foundation of the Franciscan Sisters of Joliet, Illinois. He gave official approval to their nascent community and he himself gave the religious habit to their first novice. Return to Italy In 1867, Pamfilo was summoned back to Italy. He later learned that this was due to misinformation given to the Minister General by one of the friars. By then, however, the damage was done, as he had already been replaced as Custos. He felt his departure greatly, for his letters indicate how much he had come to love his adopted country. Yet he never showed any bitterness at his treatment in his journals. In a Christmas message to one of the American friars from his new home in Rome, he wrote: > My health, thank God, continues to be good. I hope and pray that you and all > the friars there are enjoying the best of health; and I wish each and > everyone of you, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Your affectionate > confrere, Pamfilo. Pamfilo devoted the remaining years of his life to writing and the publication of significant works, the most important being his Storia Compendiosa di San Francesco e dei Francescani in two substantial volumes. He died before the third volume could be completed. Pamfilo had returned to an Italy in the midst of the struggle for its unification. Several times, the community in which he lived had to flee the armies of Garibaldi. Finally he was able to take refuge in Rome at the friary attached to the Church of San Pietro in Montorio, traditional site of the crucifixion of Saint Peter. It was there that Pamfilo died on 15 November 1876, at the age of 52. He was buried in the Cemetery of Verano in Rome.

The first leprosarium in the continental United States existed in Carville, Louisiana from 1894-1999 and Baton Rouge, Louisiana is the home of the only institution in the United States that is exclusively devoted to leprosy consulting, research, and training. History 18th Century *The route of Leprosy into Louisiana has not been resolved. However, during the 18th century, while the Spanish controlled Louisiana, Spanish physicians and surgeons noted that many of the Africans brought to Louisiana during the slave trade were afflicted with Leprosy.Gussow, Z. (1989). Leprosy, Racism, and Public Health: Social Policy in Chronic Disease Control. Boulder: Westview Press, 44. *According to City Counsel records, in 1776, the Spanish governor of Louisiana, Antonio de Ulloa, tried to banish all lepers to the outskirt of the colony. Three years later, after much objection from citizens of the colony and a devastating hurricane, this project was abandoned.Gussow, 44. *In 1785, under the rule of a new governor, Don Estevan Miro, the issue of what should be done about leprosy was raised again. The solution was to erect Louisiana's first leprosarium. According to the minutes of an April 1784 City Council meeting, it was announced that the governor built a hospital, \\"so that the lepers may be kept together.\\" This leprosarium was known as \\"La Terre des Lepreux,\\" or Leper's Land. In 1799, the leprosarium was the home of five lepers. Due to complaints, allegations of unsanitary conditions at the leprosarium, and allegations and findings that none of the five inmates had leprosy, the leprosarium was closed in 1806.Gussow, 45. 19th Century *After the Louisiana Purchase, the state had very few written records concerning leprosy until the mid-1800s. *On the 1850 U.S. Census, leprosy was listed as a cause of death. Four deaths were recorded from Louisiana.Gussow, 51. *Beginning in 1857, Annual reports from Charity Hospital (New Orleans), indicated that the hospital freely admitted those with leprosy. The large number of cases at Charity Hospital remained unreported to the general public until 1888. Releasing this data made some New Orleans residents more conscious of leprosy that they had previously been. This data, known as the Blanc Data, which is named after the doctor that released this information, informed New Orleans citizens and public health officials that, contrary to popular belief, leprosy was an endemic in New Orleans, especially among white citizens.Gussow, 57. *In the 1880s, the incidence rate of leprosy in Louisiana was 4.5 per 100,000 people.(2008).

Retrieved from: http://www.dhh.state.la.us/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/annual/LaIDAnnual_Leprosy.pdf. *By the 1890s, most accepted that leprosy existed in Louisiana, that no one knew how the disease was transmitted, and that there was no cure. When a story in the Daily Picayune alerted residents that a physician, under state contract, was caring for leprosy patients in a \\"pest-house\\" near Bayou St. John in New Orleans, a clamor went up for new laws to be passed. *The Louisiana Leper Home, an institution to quarantine lepers living in Louisiana, was opened in 1894 in Carville, Louisiana. The first seven patients of the leprosarium were from New Orleans and arrived at the leprosarium on December 1, 1894.Gaudet, M. (2004). Carville: Remembering Leprosy in America. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 8. This was the humble beginnings of the first in-patient hospital in the U.S. for the treatment of leprosy.Gaudet, 3. Due to several name changes over the years, the treatment center was frequently referred to as \\"Carville\\" because of its location. The goal of this treatment center was to provide a place for patients to be isolated and treated humanely.Gaudet, 6. *By 1896, there were 31 patients at the leprosarium. Four Catholic sisters from the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul came to care for these patients.Gaudet, 6. 20th century *In 1921, the U.S. Public Health Service took over the facility and funded a budget toward leprosy research. *By the late 1920s, Louisiana's incidence rate of leprosy reached an all-time high of 12 per 100,000.(2008).

Retrieved from: http://www.dhh.state.la.us/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/annual/LaIDAnnual_Leprosy.pdf. However, leprosy never became an epidemic in Louisiana and at the most residents Carville ever had was about 400 people.Gussow, 155. *By the early 1990s, the leprosarium had a budget of $21 million in U.S. per year. However, with fewer patients in the hospital and medical advances for the treatment of leprosy, the leprosarium lost funding and subsequently shut down in 1999. *Out-patient care in several clinics around the United States supply primary treatment and medication to the 200 or so new cases diagnosed yearly in the US. 21st Century *As of 2001, there were fifteen total leprosy, or Hansen's Disease, cases reported in Louisiana. Thirteen of those reported cases were endemic. These thirteen endemic cases came from thirteen different parishes in Louisiana. However, most of these cases were concentrated in the southern half of the state.Pfeifer, L. A. (2002, August 27). Endemic Hansen's Disease in Louisiana -2001. Retrieved October 30, 2011, from National Hansen's Disease Programs website: http://www.hrsa.gov/hansensdisease/pdfs/hansens2001louisiana.pdf Life at Carville From 1894-1999, the leprosarium underwent several name changes: Louisiana Leper Home (1894), U.S. Marine Hospital No. 66 (1921), Gillis W. Long Hansen's (Leprosy) Disease Center (1986). Due to the various names, the leprosarium was commonly referred to as \\"Carville.\\" Carville became known as the national leprosarium because all persons diagnosed with leprosy (Hansen's disease) in the U.S. were required, by law, to be quarantined and treated.Gaudet, 26. The leprosarium soon became a center for leprosy research. Identity Due to the social stigmas that surrounded leprosy in Louisiana, upon arriving at Carville, patients were encouraged to take on a new identity. As a result, many patients at Carville changed their names. Additionally, some patients had very limited contact with family members. Visitors were allowed, but the remote location made this difficult. Even the staff of the leprosarium seldom knew the patients' real names or knew what town they came from.Gaudet, 26. Literature *Numerous patients have written books, journals, and have done interviews about their times at Carville. *Carville patients had an official publication called \\"The Star.\\" Gaudet, 64. Issues dating from 1941 to 1999 can be found online at the Louisiana Digital Library. Film *\\"Secret People\\" is a documentary that details personal accounts of men and women who were residents at Carville during the 20th century. It can be viewed online in its entirety. *\\"The Triumph at Carville\\" premiered on PBS in March 2008. This film retells the history of Carville and provides insight into the lives of people affected by leprosy, including patients, family members of patients, and staff members. Leaving the leprosarium *Patients at Carville were often granted short leaves from the institution. However, they were not allowed to use public transportation and they had to return to Carville once their official leave period was over. *Escapes and attempted escapes from Carville were reported. Most of the attempts and escapes were made by men. If apprehended, one type of punishment was a sentence in the Carville jail. A first time escape was usually punished with \\"30 days in jail\\". Most people escaped through holes in the barbed wire fence.Gaudet, 69. Death When a resident of Carville died, he or she could be buried in the leprosarium's cemetery, if the family couldn't afford to bring the body home or the patient preferred to be buried at the hospital. Each patient received a tombstone that contained his or her name--either their real name or pseudonym--and case number. Personalities Many physicians in Louisiana have devoted their lives to researching leprosy. Additionally, numerous patients of Carville have worked to bring attention to the disease. *In the 1940s, Dr. Guy Henry Faget, a physician at Carville, developed sulfone therapy to treat leprosy. *During the 1950s, Dr. R. G. Cochrone, a consulting physician at Carville, developed the use of dapsone pills to treat leprosy. *A patient, using the pseudonym Betty Martin while she was a resident of Carville, published an autobiography in 1950 entitled \\"Miracle at Carville.\\" Her autobiography was on The New York Times Bestseller List. In 1959, also under the name Betty Martin, she published a follow-up titled \\"No One Must Ever Know\\". *Stanley Stein, a resident of Carville published his autobiography in 1963. The book was titled \\"Alone No Longer\\"; his real name was Sidney Maurice Levyson and he died in the mid 1960s. He was the founder and, for many years, the editor of \\"The Star\\". *In the 1960s, Dr. Paul W. Brand began the first leprosy rehabilitation research program. Policy *On February 3, 1917, the United States Senate passed US Public Law 64-299, An Act to Provide for the Care and Treatment of Persons Afflicted with Leprosy and to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy in the United States. *In 1920, the \\"Home\\" is sold by the State of Louisiana to the United States Federal Government for $35,000. *1921, The United States Public Health Service (USPHS) takes operational control and the 'Home' becomes the United States Marine Hospital Number 66. . . The National Leprosarium of the United States. *In 1982, The Health Resources and Services Administration: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, assumed responsibility for the management and operation of the leprosarium at Carville. *In 1998, The U.S. Congress passed a bill to relocate the leprosarium to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Medical advances *The 1941 development of sulfone therapy, a type of chemotherapy, made leprosy non-contagious. *Daspone pills became widely used for treating leprosy in the 1950s. *In 1981, The World Health Organization recommended using a multi-drug treatment regimen to treat leprosy. *In 2011, researchers at the National Hansen's Disease Program published their findings that leprosy in Louisiana and in other southern states may be linked to contact with armadillos. They came to this conclusion after finding that armadillos had the same strain of leprosy as some human patients in Louisiana did. *Currently, researchers are trying to develop a leprosy vaccine and are trying to find new methods of detection.

His Bengali re-telling of the Mahābhārata, known as Kāśīdāsī Môhābhārôt, is a popular and influential version of the Mahābhārata legend in Bengal. Although the entire work is intra-textually ascribed to him, most scholars agree that he composed only the first four of the eighteen books (parvas). As with the Rāmāyaṇa of Kṛttibās Ojhā, Kāśīrām freely removed elements and added other legends to the story. Dās is not a last name and is a title meaning ‘servant’ in the Vaiṣṇava tradition; the name is also written as Kashiramdas ().Kashiramdas, article by Sukhamay Mukherjee in the Encyclopedia of Indian Literature, Sahitya Akademi, v.III p. 2003 Life Kāśīrām Dās was born to a Vaiṣṇava Kayastha family in the village of Singi, adjacent to Katwa in Bardhaman district; his death anniversary is still observed in the region. Kāśīrām was the second son of Kamalākānta Dās;Kalipada Chaudhuri, Bangla Sahityer Itihas (Bengali: বাংলা সাহিত্যের ইতিহাস), Bani Samsad, p.121–122 two of his brothers were noted poets on their own, in the Vaishnava Padavali tradition. His elder brother, Ghanaśyām Dās, is the author of Śrīkṛṣṇavilās, and his younger brother, Gadādhar, composed Jagannāthamaṅgal. Although Kāśīrām’s topic was outside the mainstream Kṛṣṇa legend, his work is stylistically in the same tradition and uses the paẏār chanda (paẏār: metre). There is some doubt regarding his birthplace. It appears that Kamalākānta left the Bardhaman area (at the time known as Indrani Pargana) and had settled in Orissa, so it might be that Kāśīrām was born in OrissaSukhamay Mukherjee, madhyajuger bangla sahityer tathya o kalakrama, 1974 and then returned to Bengal (Midnapore) at a later stage. As a Sanskrit and Vaishnava scholar, Kāśīrām was patronised by a zamindar family in Midnapore, and ran a pathshala (small school) there. In addition to the Kashidasi Mahabharat, he is cited to have composed several works, including Satyanārāẏaṇer Pũthi (the book of Satyanarayana), Svapna-Parba (dream reverie), and Nalopakhyan (tale of Nala), which are now lost. Kashidasi Mahabharat It is said that he was inspired to embark on composing a Bengali version of the Mahābhārata after a recitation of the Sanskrit text at his patron's home. He may have been guided in this enterprise by his teacher Abhiram Mukhuti of Haraharpur. It is quite clear that the first four parvas-- ādi, sabhā, vana, and virāṭā--were composed by him around the turn of the 16th century. The vanity refrain at the end of the virata parva gives the date of its composition as the shaka year 1526 (1604 CE). He had embarked on the next book, the vana-parva, but it is thought that he may have died shortly thereafter, and the remaining books were completed by his son-in-law, nephew, and other relatives, who followed the same style and even retained the 'Kashiram Das' vanity line after each chapter. The entire work was completed around 1610 AD. Kashiram Das had named his text Bharata-Pā̃cālī, where Bharata refers to the Bharata dynasty, and pā̃cālī refers to the narrative song tradition of Bengal. The pā̃cālī works attempt to tell a story that will keep the audience's interest. In this spirit, Kashiram Das avoids the long philosophical discourses that are part of the Mahābhārata, such as the entire discourse of Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna (the Bhagavadgītā). On the other hand, he elaborates the story of Mohini—the female avatar of Viṣṇu who enchants Śiva—based on a two-line śloka in the original.Pradip Bhattacharya, Amrita – The Apple of Eris Although other Bengali Mahābhāratas had been composed earlier (for example, Kavindra Mahabharata, 1525), the Kashidasi Mahabharata soon became the staple of Bengali Mahābhārata readings. Composed in the mangalkavya tradition, the vanity refrain has become a staple of Bengali tradition: > môhābhārôter kôthaā ômṛtô sômān kāśīrām dās kôhe śune punyôbān This is translated to: \\"The Mahābhārata tales are like amrita, says Kashiram Das; it brings merit to listen to it.\\" Other phrases that have become part of the Bengali folklore include \\"krodhe pāp, krodhe tāp, krodhe kulôkṣôẏ;\\"http://www.milansagar.com/kobi-kashiramdas.html (\\"anger causes sin, anger causes heat, anger causes the demise of one's line\\"). When the Serampore Mission Press was started in the 19th century, the Kāśīdāsī Môhābhārôt in parts were among the first Bengali texts to be printed. Eventually, the complete text, edited by Jayagopal Tarkalankar, was published in 1936 by the same press.

It was written for and dedicated to the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, by whom it was premiered on 19 June 2000 at the St Magnus Festival, in the Pickaquoy Centre, Kirkwall, Orkney, conducted by the composer. Character and materials Davies regards this symphony as part of a seven-member cycle, but not as its conclusion. Instead of ending, the Seventh Symphony forms a harmonic link to the opening of the First Symphony . The composer describes the Seventh as his \\"most classical\\" symphony, with particular dependence on the music of Joseph Haydn . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes (second doubling alto flute), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani (a tom-tom or roto-tom may be substituted for the piccolo timp), five percussionists (playing glockenspiel, marimba, crotales, tubular bells, 2 wood blocks (small, medium), tambourine, bubbolo, side drum, 2 bass drums (small, very large), antique cymbals, small suspended Chinese cymbal, clashed cymbals, 2 suspended cymbals (small, large), tam-tam), harp, celesta, and strings. Analysis The symphony is in four movements: # Exposition # Minuet and Trio # Slow Movement # Development The first movement behaves as the exposition section (only) of a symphonic movement, contrasting two types of musical material, both from each other, and from bridging music with less well-defined characteristics . The second movement, in the classical form of a minuet and trio, was inspired by the op. 20 String Quartets of Haydn, though the musical surface does not sound like the Haydn models (; ). Although the composer points to the simple, two- and three-part string writing at the beginning of the third, slow movement, as representing the spirit and style of Haydn's middle period , the following build-up and climax has been seen as owing a heavy debt to Gustav Mahler . The last movement is not a finale, but rather is titled \\"Development\\". Its dominant characteristic is that of the traditional development section of a classical symphony: systematic modulation through a succession of tonalities while, at the same time, ideas from earlier in the symphony are fragmented, reassembled, and reworked . After a dramatic accelerando, a quotation from the slow movement arrives, followed by an inconclusive ending that links to the opening of the First Symphony , \\"so that the whole cycle could start over again\\" .

It acts as an addendum to the famous 16th century novel Journey to the West and takes place between the end of chapter sixty-one and the beginning of chapter sixty-two. In the story, the Monkey King is trapped in a dream world by the Qing Fish demon, an embodiment of desire, who wishes to eat his master, the Tang Sanzang. He wanders from one adventure to the next, using a magic tower of mirrors and a jade doorway to travel to different points in time. In the Qin Dynasty, he disguises himself as Consort Yu in order locate a magic weapon needed for his quest to India. During the Song Dynasty, he serves in place of King Yama as the judge of Hell. After returning to the Tang Dynasty, he finds that Tang Sanzang has taken a wife and become a general charged with wiping out desire. In the end, Monkey unwillingly participates in a great war between all the kingdoms of the world, during which time he faces one of his own sons on the battlefield. He eventually awakens in time to kill the demon, thus freeing himself of desire. At the end of the novel, the author lists twelve hypothetical questions that a reader might ask and answers them. For instance, he explains that the reason he wrote the Supplement is because he wanted Monkey to face an opponent—in this case desire—that he could not defeat with his great strength. He also explains why he waited to reveal the monster at the end of the novel, why Monkey serves as King Yama, and the peculiarities of time travel in the dream world. There is a debate between scholars over when the book was actually published. One school of thought favors a political interpretation which lends itself to a later publication after the founding of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). The second favors a religious interpretation which lends itself to an earlier publication during the late Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Evidence in favor of the former includes references to the stench of nearby “Tartars,” a possible allusion to the Manchus who would eventually found the Qing and conquer China. Evidence in favor of the latter includes references to Buddhist sutras and the suppression of desire and the lack of political statements “lament[ing] the fate of the country.” The novel can ultimately be linked to the Ming because a mid-17th century poem dates it to the year 1640. The novel draws heavily from Yuan and Ming Dynasty tales, including the literary ancestor of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Plot During the battle with the Rakshasi Lady Iron Fan, Monkey transforms into an insect and enters her stomach. He forces her to give him the magic fan that he needs to quell the heavenly fire of the Flaming Mountain blocking their path to India. However, while he is in her stomach he becomes aroused with passion. This becomes a chink in Monkey's emotional and spiritual armor as he is otherwise without weakness. It is months after the pilgrims bypass the mountain that he falls prey to the magic of the Qing Fish demon, an embodiment of desire. The demon uses its powers of illusion to trap him in a dream world so nothing will keep it from eating the Tang Priest. The story from this point reads disjointedly as the dream world does not adhere to the rules of the physical world. While on a mission to find food, Monkey comes upon a large city flying the banner “Great Tang’s New Son-of-Heaven, the Restoration Emperor, thirty-eighth successor of Taizong.” This strikes him as odd as it was Taizong who had originally sent them to retrieve the Buddhist scriptures in India. This means that either the pilgrims’ journey has taken hundreds of years, or the city is a fake. He flies to heaven in order to learn more about the Great Tang, but finds that the gates are locked because an imposter Monkey has stolen the Palace of Magic Mists. The situation becomes stranger when he returns to the city and learns that the king has sent someone to invite the Tang Priest to become a general of his military. But when Monkey tries to intercept the messenger, the person is nowhere to be found, and he instead comes upon mortal men flying on magic clouds picking at the foundations of heaven with spears and axes. From them he learns that Little Moon King (), the ruler of the neighboring Kingdom of Great Compassion, has put up a great bronze wall and a fine mesh netting to block Monkey's path to India. But because he feels sorry for the Tang Priest, the Little Moon King forced the men to dig a hole in the firmament of heaven so that Tang Sanzang could hop from the Daoist heaven to the Buddhist heaven to complete his mission. In the process, the men accidentally caused the Palace of Magic Mists to fall through to earth (the reason heaven blamed it on him). Monkey goes to the Emerald Green World, Little Moon King's imperial city, to fetch his master, but is blocked from entering once inside the main gate. When he uses his great strength to break open the wall, he falls into a magic tower of mirrors, gateways to different points in history and other universes. Monkey travels to the “World of the Ancients” (the Qin Dynasty) by drilling through a bronze mirror. He disguises himself as Beautiful Lady Yu, concubine of King Xiang Yu of Chu, in order to retrieve a magic “Mountain-removing Bell” from the first Qin Emperor so that he can use it to clear the group's path to India of any obstacles blocking their way. But Monkey later learns that the Jade Emperor had banished the emperor to the “World of Oblivion,” which lies beyond the “World of the Future.” Xiang Yu takes him to a village housing a set of Jade gates that lead to the World of the Future. Monkey leaps through and travels hundreds of years forward in time to the Song Dynasty. An idealized woodblock print of Yue Fei wearing imperial garb. After resuming his normal form, some junior devils appear and tell him that King Yama has recently died of an illness and that Monkey must take his place as judge of the dead until a suitable replacement can be found. He ends up judging the fate of the recently deceased Prime Minister Qin Hui. Monkey puts Qin through a series of horrific tortures, after which a demon uses its magic breath to blow his broken body back into its proper form. He finally sends a demon to heaven to retrieve a powerful magic gourd that sucks anyone who speaks before it inside and melts them down into a bloody stew. He uses this for Qin's final punishment. Meanwhile, Monkey invites the ghost of Yue Fei to the underworld and takes him as his third master. He entertains Yue until Qin has been reduced to liquid and offers the general a cup of the Prime Minister's \\"blood wine.\\" Yue, however, refuses on the grounds that drinking it would sully his soul. Monkey then does an experiment where he makes a junior devil drink of the wine. Sometime later, the devil, apparently under the evil influence of the blood wine, murders his personal religious teacher and escapes into the \\"gate of ghosts,\\" presumably being reborn into another existence. Yue Fei then takes his leave to return to his heavenly abode. Monkey sends him off with a huge display of respect by making all of the millions of denizens of the underworld kowtow before him. After leaving the underworld, Monkey is able to return to the tower of mirrors with the help of the New Ancient, a man who had been trapped in the World of the Future for centuries. However, when he tries to leave the tower through a window, Monkey becomes entangled by red threads (a representation of desire). He becomes so worried that his own spirit leaves his body and, in the guise of an old man, snaps the threads. He later discovers from a local Daoist immortal that the Qin Emperor has loaned the Mountain-removing Bell to the founder of the Han Dynasty, his former enemy. In addition, he learns that the Tang Priest has given up the journey to India, dismissed his other disciples Pigsy and Friar Sand, taken a wife, and accepted the position as a general of the imposter Great Tang's military. Tang Sanzang begins to amass a huge army to fight the forces of desire led by King Paramita, one of Monkey's five sons born to Lady Iron Fan. Monkey is eventually made a junior general and faces his son in battle. Confusion sets in causing the clashing armies to attack both friend and foe. This shock causes Monkey to slowly wake from the dream. Somewhere between the dream world and the world of reality, he learns from the disembodied Master of the Void that he has been bewitched by the Qing Fish demon. Monkey and the Qing Fish have a connection because they were born at the same time from the same primordial energies at the beginning of time. The only difference is that Monkey's positive Yang energy is offset by the demon's far more powerful negative Yin energy. The demon is in effect the physical embodiment of Monkey's desires. When he finally awakens, having dreamed the entire adventure in only a few seconds, he discovers that the demon has infiltrated the Tang Priest's retinue by taking on the form of a young and beautiful Buddhist monk. Monkey instantly kills him with his iron cudgel, thereby killing his desire. He explains everything that has transpired, and the Tang Priest commends him for his great effort.  Questions and answers  At the end of the novel, the author lists twelve hypothetical questions that a reader might ask and answers them. Some of the answers are very similar in nature and, sometimes, contradictory. The first question asks whether a supplement was even necessary since the original novel did not seem to be incomplete. He explains that it was written so Monkey would face an enemy—in this case desire—that he could not defeat with his great strength. By experiencing desire he learns to separate himself from it, thus helping to bring about true enlightenment. The second asks why he faces a single enemy who tricks him with magic, instead of many who want to eat the Tang Priest. The author answers this question with a quote by the philosopher Mencius: “There is no better way of learning than to seek your own strayed heart.” The third asks why Dong waited to reveal the monster Monkey faces at the end of the novel, instead of doing so in the title of one of the chapters like in the original. He states that desire is formless and soundless, meaning people can be affected by it without knowing it. Therefore, the Qing fish monster is present throughout the entire book. The fourth asks how it's possible for the spirit of Qin Hui, who lived during the Song, to be in the Tang Dynasty. Dong points out that anything is possible in a dream. The fifth asks why Monkey becomes the fearsome King Yama in the future. He explains a person who travels to the future must embolden their spirit when facing adversity. By killing the six thieves, torturing Qin and honoring Yue, Monkey is able to break free of the Qing fish's power. The sixth asks why the Tang Priest becomes a general. He becomes a general to wipe out the forces of desire. The seventh indirectly asks why the Tang Priest cries when a young girl plays the pipa. Dong quotes the Buddhist tenet that sorrow is the source of desire. The eighth asks how it's possible for Monkey to have a wife and children. He states that the book is simply a dream. The ninth asks why a chaotic battle erupts between the five armies after Monkey escapes from inside the Qing fish. It's because the accumulation of desire reaches the breaking point. It can be likened to being forced awake during the worst part of a nightmare. The tenth asks why Monkey is able to escape the dream world just by participating in combat. Dong says combat is how he kills his desire. The eleventh asks if it's possible to gouge holes in heaven like the flying men do. This is not directly answered. The author states Monkey would not have been able to be trapped inside of the Qing fish without encountering these men. The twelfth asks why the Qing fish is portrayed as being young and beautiful. Dong explains that these are the qualities that desire has taken from the beginning of time. Proposed datings Sudhana learning from one of the fifty-two teachers along his journey toward enlightenment. Sanskrit manuscript, 11-12th century. There is a debate between scholars over when the book was actually published. One school of thought favors a political interpretation which lends itself to a later publication after the founding of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). The second favors a religious interpretation which lends itself to an earlier publication during the late Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Proponents of the political interpretation take the qing (, desire) of the Qing fish to be an allusion to the qing (, pure) of the Qing Dynasty (). The English translators of the book, who appear neutral in the debate, point out three things that may support this view: First, the reason Dong included Qin Hui in the story may have been because the Prime Minister historically betrayed the Song to the Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty. Centuries later, the Manchu chieftain Nurhachi, an ancestor of the Jurchens, founded the Later Jin dynasty in 1616. This dynasty was later renamed the Qing Dynasty in 1636. So even if the book was published prior to the fall of the Ming Dynasty in 1644, the Qing fish may indeed been meant as an analogy for the Qing. Second, Monkey is offended by an odor created by Tartars “right next door.” Since the Manchus resided “next door” to northern China, the idea of an invasion may have been on Dong's mind while he was writing the book. Third, Dong may have been ridiculing the Ming's inaction towards an imminent Manchu invasion when the New Ancient tells Monkey that his body will take on the stink of the barbarians if he stays too long. Proponents who favor the political interpretation include the scholars Xu Fuming and Liu Dajie. Proponents of the religious interpretation prefer to take the Qing fish for what it is, an embodiment of desire. The author Dong Yue is known to have been alienated by Buddhism's denigration of desire, and so the Tang Priest's position as the General of “Qing-killing” is simply a satire aimed at the religion. Madeline Chu believes the constant repetition of the color green (, qing)—green cities, green towers, green robes, etc.—is an analogy for human emotions. She also points out that the Chinese characters used to spell Little Moon King () are visually similar to the three that comprise desire (). The English translators note that the physical Tower of Myriad Mirrors recalls a tale from the Buddhist Avatamsaka Sutra in which the Bodhisattva Maitreya creates a self-contained universe inside of a tower in order to bring about the enlightenment of Guanyin's disciple Sudhana. Therefore, Monkey is just like Sudhana because the events he experiences inside of the tower eventually leads to his enlightenment. There are other reasons to accept a Ming publication. The scholar Lu Xun muses, “Actually the book contains more digs at Ming fashions than laments over the fate of the country, and I suspect that it was written before the end of the [Ming] dynasty.\\" Most importantly, there is a woodblock edition of the novel that was printed during the 1628-1644 reign of the Chongzhen Emperor. The preface is dated to the year xinsi, which Madeline Chu believes to be the year 1641. Additionally, a note appearing in the poem “Random Thoughts” (1650) comments that the author Dong Yue “supplemented the Xiyouji ten years ago,” which dates the writing of the novel to 1640. Influences Hell Scroll. The Supplement's episode of the torture of Qin Hui in hell has many elements that appeared in earlier fictional literature. The idea of someone serving as an adjunct king of hell was first mentioned in a collection of oral traditions called Popular tales of the Record of the Three Kingdoms (), the literary ancestor of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This was one of five such compilations printed in the Newly Published, Fully Illustrated Pinghua () series during the reign of Yuan Emperor Yingzhong (1321-1323). It was later popularized in Feng Menglong's Stories of Old and New (, 1620), a collection of original works and earlier oral traditions. The tale entitled \\"Sima Mao Disrupts Order in the Underworld and Sits in Judgment\\" is about a poor Han Dynasty scholar named Sima Mao who is constantly passed over for promotion to various government posts in favor of wealthy men who underhandedly pay for their positions. Sima writes a poem criticizing the celestial hierarchy and claims he could do a better job at righting wrongs than the king of hell. The Jade Emperor of heaven initially wishes to punish Sima for his blasphemy, but the embodiment of the Planet Venus talks him into letting the scholar act as the King of Hell for twelve hours to test his worth. Sima is given Yama's throne under the stipulation that he will enjoy success in his next life if he solves hell's most difficult cold cases, but will be damned never to be reborn into the human realm if he fails. He tries four cases involving famous Han Dynasty personages—Han Xin, Peng Yue, Liu Bang, etc.—and passes sagely verdicts. For his great deed, Sima and his wife are born into wealth in their next lives. Portions of the story dealing with Yue Fei's retribution originally appeared in several storytelling compilations, including the fifteenth-century work An Imitative Collection of Stories (), and in an early folklore biography on the general named Restoration of the Great Song Dynasty: The Story of King Yue (, c. 1552). Feng Menlong later used such oral tales when he adapted the aforementioned story about Sima Mao to write \\"Humu Di Intones Poems and Visits the Netherworld,\\" which was included in his collection. It is about a poor Yuan Dynasty scholar named Humu Di () who fails to gain a government post because he cannot pass the imperial exams. After a bout of drinking, Humu writes a series of poems criticizing heaven for not punishing the wicked and states he would torture Qin Hui for the murder of Yue Fei if he was the king of hell. For his irreverent remarks, Humu's soul is dragged to the Chinese underworld of Diyu. There, King Yama orders an underworld official to take Humu on a tour of the various tortures of hell in order to witness firsthand the result of karmic retribution. The two first come to Qin Hui's personal hell where his punishments are similar to those mentioned in the Supplement. His destroyed body is blown back into its proper form by a \\"sinister whirling wind\\" after each punishment has been metered. The official explains after three years of continuous torture, Qin will be reborn on earth as all manner of animals, including pigs, to be slaughtered and eaten until the end of time. The two then view the tortures of other wicked people before returning to Yama's palace. After having tea with the souls of righteous men waiting on their rebirths, Yama sends Humu back to the world of the living satisfied that the heavenly hierarchy is doing its job. Humu becomes an official in hell upon his death years later. Eastern Peak Temple statues representing the \\"Department of rain gods\\". A modified version of the former tale appears in Yue Fei's later folklore biography The Story of Yue Fei (1684). This story is about a rich, drunken Song Dynasty scholar named Hu Di () who writes a blasphemous poem and is himself dragged to hell for his remarks about King Yama. He is taken on a tour and attends the punishment of the recently deceased Qin Hui, which includes the same tortures and endless karmic rebirths as animals. Qin's damaged body is, again, put back into its proper form by a magical wind. Hu returns to Yama's palace convinced that he was too quick to judge the ways of heaven and hell. Yama allows Hu to write out formal charges against Qin and his family. Meanwhile, in a manner similar to the Supplement, the soul of Yue Fei is brought to hell. He learns the reason he suffered an untimely death is because he went against the ways of heaven in his former life. Qin Hui is then brought before Yue to be summarily beaten with iron rods for the charges brought against him. After seeing the general off from Hell, King Yama orders a demon to quickly return Hu's soul to the world of the living in order to avoid his earthly body from decomposing. He lives a life of charity and dies in his 90s. The story of Qin's torture in hell is so well known that the Daoist Eastern Peak Temple, which is famous for its statuary representations of the celestial hierarchy, has a small hall dedicated to Yue Fei in which a likeness of the former Prime Minister is being led off to the underworld by a demon. It is also important to note that Yue Fei's headless ghost is a prominent fixture in religious Chinese Hell Scrolls.

Roupell was the daughter of Rev. John Dryden Piggott, rector and squire of Edgmond, and married Thomas Boone Roupell, an East India Company official, on 16 September 1840. In 1843, shortly after the birth of her eldest son, her husband was posted to the Cape for a period of service leave and she chose to accompany him. During her two-year stay in South Africa Roupell painted local flowers. A visitor to the Cape, Nathaniel Wallich, who was at that time in charge of the Calcutta Botanical Garden, and a guest at the same Cape Town hotel as the Roupells, was struck by the quality of her work. Wallich accompanied Roupell on collecting trips to the Cape countryside, and introduced her family to his friends Thomas Maclear, the Cape Astronomer Royal, and his wife Mary, leading to a lasting friendship between the women. Among the others Roupell befriended were Baron von Ludwig, planner and developer of the Botanical Garden in Cape Town, and the Kew plant collector, James Bowie. The Roupells returned to Madras in 1845 where Arabella Roupell continued her botanical painting. When Wallich retired to London from Calcutta in 1846, he persuaded her to allow him to take along some of her paintings to show to Sir William Jackson Hooker. Hooker was delighted with her work and with Arabella's botanist brother-in-law, George Roupell, chose ten of the plates for publication. Having received the blessing of both Hooker and Wallich, the plates were handed to the eminent Victorian lithographer, Paul Gauci, who prepared the illustrations for the printer W. Nicol of the Shakespeare Press on Pall Mall. The descriptive text accompanying the plates was provided by William Henry Harvey, the Irish botanist. One hundred subscribers were listed, a large portion being from the Peerage, and not counting Victoria, Prince Albert and the Directors of the East India Company. The book was well received not only in England, but also on the Continent, where the author was elected a member of the Regensburg Society of Arts. The work is dedicated to Wallich in recognition of his 'flattering encouragement and scientific guidance' with 'every feeling of grateful and affectionate esteem.' It is thought that only 110 copies of the atlas folio were printed, making the work rare, expensive and highly desirable to collectors. The East India Company was dissolved in 1858 whereupon the Roupells retired to Loddar Court near Reading in Berkshire. By this time the family was financially secure, Thomas having been promoted to sessions judge while in India, and posted first to Coimbatore and later to Cuddalore. Roupell took up landscape gardening and spent part of each year at Sundorne Castle, her father's inheritance in Shropshire. The hundred or so plates that had not been published were located in the 1930s through Elizabeth Chute Roupell, the widow of Norton Aylmer Roupell, and daughter-in-law of the artist. They had passed into the possession of George Roupell, a grandson of the artist and nephew of Elizabeth Chute Roupell. Repeated letters from his aunt and from Pretoria went unanswered by George and the matter seemed to have got nowhere. In a surprising development, a package arrived in Irene from England for General Jan Smuts during his final illness. The parcel remained unopened until after Smuts' death in 1950 when it was passed on to Illtyd Pole-Evans, who in 1930 had accompanied John Hutchinson and Jan Smuts on a two-month botanising expedition through Southern and Northern Rhodesia to Nyasaland and Lake Tanganyika. Pole Evans passed the paintings on to Mary Gunn, librarian at the Botanical Research Institute, who immediately recognised them as the long sought-after collection. After being displayed at an exhibition held at the Johannesburg Public Library in November 1951, the Smuts family presented the paintings to the University of Cape Town, which passed them on to the library of the Bolus Herbarium. Eleven of the plates from this collection were published under the title 'More Cape Flowers by a Lady' in 1964, while the same plates, with the addition of two more and biographical material, appeared under the title 'Arabella Roupell' in 1975. A painting of a Cape Erica, which had been given to Lady d'Urban, Sir Benjamin d'Urban's wife, is now held by the Museum Africa in Johannesburg. Roupell is commemorated by Protea roupelliae, named by the Swiss botanist Carl Meissner. The short-lived taxon Roupellia grata, a flowering creeper from Sierra Leone and named to honour various members of the Roupell family, was lumped as Strophanthus gratus by the French botanist Henri Ernest Baillon.

In 2002 he was convicted of the murders after a six-week trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years. He appealed the conviction to the Court of Appeal; the appeal was rejected and the court increased his non-parole period to 20 years. In June 2013 Lundy took his case to the Privy Council in Britain.Mark Lundy's sister hopeful over appeal bid TVNZ OneNews 20 June 2013 In October 2013 the Privy Council quashed the convictions and ordered a re- trial. In April 2015, at the end of the retrial, Lundy was again found guilty. Lundy continued to claim he is innocent and in 2017 took his case to the Court of Appeal a second time. On 9 October 2018 the Court of Appeal released its decision to dismiss the appeal. Background Mark and Christine Lundy had been married for 18 years; Amber was their only child. They jointly owned a kitchen sink business. In 1999, Mark Lundy bought a vineyard in Hawke's Bay on which he still owed more than NZ$2 million in 2000.  Events on the day of the murders  The murders occurred sometime during the night of Tuesday 29 August 2000. On that Tuesday morning, Lundy drove to Wellington on one of his regular business trips. He checked into a motel in Petone at around 5:00 pm. His wife or daughter called him on his cell phone in Petone; Lundy said he was told during the call that they were going to McDonald's for dinner; the call ended at 5:43 pm. His cell phone records also showed he made a call from Petone to a business partner of his Hawke's Bay wine-making venture at 8.28 pm. At 11:30 pm he called an escort service in Petone. Police found a McDonald's receipt in the Lundy home for food bought at 5.45pm on 29 August. Christine Lundy took a call at home from a friend just before 7 pm that night. At 7:20 pm a witness described seeing a \\"suspicious looking jogger\\" nearby. The computer at the Lundy home was switched off at 10:52 pm. At Lundy's retrial in 2015, Christine's brother testified that he went to the Lundy home the next morning to see Christine about a business matter. He said he entered through an open ranchslider and found the bodies of Christine and Amber bludgeoned to death. Christine's body was on her bed; Amber's was on the floor in the doorway of Christine's bedroom. Both had died of head injuries caused by multiple blows from what was determined to be a tomahawk-like weapon or small axe. No weapon was found. A rear window had been tampered with and had Christine's blood on it. A jewellery box was later determined to be missing. First trial After a police investigation of six months, Lundy was arrested and charged with their murders. The trial took place in the High Court in Palmerston North. Prosecution case Four days before the murders, the Lundys increased their life insurance on the advice of their insurance broker. Christine's cover was raised from $200,000 to $500,000. Lundy adviser proposed life cover lift, court told, NZ Herald, 15 February 2002 The prosecution contended that Lundy killed his wife for her life insurance money because of financial pressure, and killed his daughter because she was a witness. However, the policy documents had not been issued so the increase was not valid at the time of Christine death. Mark Lundy murder retrial: Focus on finances, Stuff, 16 February 2015 The prosecution's case was also based on a speck of body tissue found on one of Lundy's polo shirts; the shirt was found along with other clothes and miscellaneous items on the back seat of his car. Although New Zealand pathologists could not identify it as Christine's brain tissue, a pathologist from Texas did. The prosecution argued the only way this brain tissue could have got on the shirt was if Lundy himself was the murderer. Later reports and tests by other experts cast doubt upon the identification of the material as brain tissue. No weapon was ever found, but paint found in the hair of victims matched the paint Lundy used to mark the tools in his toolshed. The prosecution called more than 130 Crown witnesses. Defence case The defence called three witnesses including Lundy himself, who emphatically denied killing his wife and daughter. A key defence argument was that Lundy could not possibly have made the round trip from Wellington to Palmerston North and back in three hours, pointing out that Lundy's phone records prove that his phone was in Petone at 5:43 pm and at 8:48 pm. Regarding the brain tissue evidence, the defence noted that there was blood and tissue splattered everywhere including on the walls, the bed and the floor around the bodies but \\"his car, glasses, wedding ring, shoes and other clothes were all tested for blood or other tissue and absolutely nothing was found\\"; they said contamination could account for the tissue found on Lundy's shirt. Verdict The jury deliberated for seven hours before finding Lundy guilty of the murder of his wife and child. He was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years. Lundy's brother Craig, who gave evidence at the trial, publicly stated that he believed Lundy was guilty, while his sister and brother-in-law claimed his innocence.The Lundy murders. 3 News NZ. 7 October 2013. Appeals  Court of Appeal  Lundy unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Appeal in 2002,Court of Appeal decision and the appeal resulted in his non-parole period being increased from 17 years to 20 years.  Privy Council  In November 2012, Lundy applied to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council seeking permission to appeal his murder convictions. The appeal was based on three issues: the time of death, the time of shutdown of Christine's computer, and the presence of brain tissue on Lundy's shirt. The hearing before the Privy Council (including Chief Justice of New Zealand Dame Sian Elias) began on 17 June 2013, with possible decisions being to reject the appeal, thus affirming Lundy's convictions and sentence; to overturn the convictions and order a new trial; or to send the case back to the Court of Appeal in New Zealand for determination. The Privy Council reserved its decision after the three day hearing. On 4 October 2013, the Privy Council upheld Lundy's appeal against his double murder convictions and quashed them, ordering a retrial. It concluded that Lundy's convictions were \\"unsafe\\" in light of new evidence that had been presented. Mark Lundy was released from prison under probation orders on 5 October 2013 pending a second trial.  Second trial  In 2015 Lundy was tried a second time. The Crown case was led by Philip Morgan QC. The defence was led by David Hislop QC. The Crown made significant changes to the prosecution case against Lundy following the ruling of the Privy Council. They no longer claimed that Lundy made a 300km round trip from Petone to Palmerston North in less than three hours to commit the murders. Instead, they argued Lundy drove up to Palmerston North in the middle of the night after he had been with the prostitute. The jury also heard about scientific tests which were conducted on tissue found on one of Lundy's shirts. The Crown claimed the stains were brain or spinal cord matter from Christine while the defence argued they could have been stains from a meat pie.Mark Lundy loses appeal for murder of wife and daughter, Newshub, 10 May 2019 The tests were developed by Dr Laetitia, from a laboratory in the Netherlands, specifically for the Lundy case; they had never been used before and have never been used since.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in October 2018. It ruled that the Crown evidence about RNA (the alleged presence of brain tissue on Lundy's shirt and similar to DNA) in the retrial was inadmissible but decided the appeal should be dismissed \\"on the basis that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\\"  Supreme Court  Lundy was found guilty in the second trial after the results of two different tests, immunohistochemistry [IHC] and mRNA, conducted on tissue found on one of his shirts were presented to the jury.

Supreme Court agrees to hear Mark Lundy's murder appeal, NZ Herald, 6 May 2019 This was the 'proviso', the mechanism that allowed the Court of Appeal to dismiss Lundy's appeal.Supreme Court grants Mark Lundy appeal, RNZ, 6 May 2019 Lundy's lawyer, Jonathan Eaton QC, then argued to the Supreme Court that Lundy had become the victim of 'junk science' and in May 2019, he was granted leave to have his appeal heard by the Supreme Court - solely on the proviso argument. On 20 December 2019, the Supreme Court of New Zealand dismissed Lundy's appeal, stating in its concluding paragraph that \\"The other evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Lundy murdered Christine and Amber Lundy.\\"  Other theories of the murders  Geoff Levick, who runs a campaign to have Lundy's convictions overturned, believed Lundy was innocent largely based on the time needed to travel from Petone to Lundy's house and return. He speculated that a creditor of Lundy paid someone to go to Lundy's house to \\"teach him a lesson\\", but Lundy was not there and matters \\"got out of hand\\". In 2009, North & South magazine published the results of an investigation into the case by Mike White titled The Lundy murders: what the jury didn't hear. Lundy would have had only three hours to make the return journey from Petone to Palmerston North, a round trip of approximately , kill his wife and daughter, change his clothes and dispose of evidence; White contended that was not possible in such a short time frame. In order to make it back to Petone by 8.28 pm, Lundy would have had to drive to Palmerston North in rush hour traffic at an average speed of around 117 km/h (73 mph; the maximum open road speed limit in New Zealand at the time was 100 km/h, 62 mph), commit the crimes, and make the return journey back to Petone at an average speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). In 2012, documentary film maker, Bryan Bruce made an episode examining the Lundy case as part of his series The Investigator. Like others, Bruce believed that Lundy could not possibly have made the return trip in three hours, but he thought Lundy could have made the trip and committed the crimes later that night, returning to Petone in the early hours of the morning.  Lundy 500  In July 2009, Salient editor Jackson Wood courted controversy by announcing the \\"Lundy 500\\", an event whereby teams of vehicles would \\"travel from Petone to Palmerston North as convicted double murderer Mark Lundy did in 2000, before murdering wife Christine and daughter Amber, according to the prosecution at his 2002 trial.\\" Participants were tasked with doing the trip in 68 minutes or less, the same time Lundy is argued to have driven the distance. Wood argued that the \\"event was designed to draw attention to some of the inconsistencies in the New Zealand legal system\\", and emphasised that he wasn't encouraging anyone to break the law. However, the proposed event was harshly criticised in the media, and on 2 August it was announced that the event was to be cancelled. Wood apologised to the Lundy family and wrote that: \\"He acknowledged that their viewpoints were not adequately taken into account before the event was announced on Friday, and that there were other ways for this point to be communicated\\". A similar re- enactment of the travel involved in the Lundy case, dubbed the \\"Lundy Three Hundy\\" was proposed in 2013 by Nic Miller. It was likewise criticised in the media, with Mathew Grocott writing that \\"this event should not go ahead and if those involved have any human decency then it won't go ahead.\\" See also * Crime in New Zealand * New Zealand Police * David Bain * Teina Pora References External links *Beyond the Darklands - Mark Lundy - Series 3, Episode 4 *Lundy's Last Chance?

History  Written in 1963 for the annual conference of the College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) and published by Maecenas Music, Gilmore's Five Folk Songs for Soprano and Band has enjoyed countless performances nationwide and internationally. This composition is the first major work written expressly for soprano and band and was awarded \\"Best Original Composition\\" at the CBDNA Biennial Conference in 1967. It has been commercially recorded by the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music Wind Symphony, conducted by Eugene Corporon. In 2007, it was performed by the Southern Illinois University Carbondale Wind Ensemble, both on the SIUC campus and at Carnegie Hall under the direction of Christopher Morehouse.SIUC Wind Ensemble Concert Programs 2007–2008 The work was also arranged for soprano and orchestra and performed in San Diego in 2008 under the direction of David Amos.

According to the program notes in the conductor's score, \\"it was inspired by folk recordings of Theodore Bikel and groups like The Limelighters.\\" To prevent the voice from being overpowered by the band, much of the craft of Gilmore's work lies in his judicious balance of voice and instruments.Humboldt State University Department of Music, Paul Cummings: Director's Notes for Symphonic Band Rarely are all musicians performing at once, yet there is sufficient variety of dynamics and textures to create interest. The light construction of the piece allows for the use of solos to emulate a character rarely heard in traditional wind band music. For example, the 2nd Movement features a nearly two-minute long improvisatory cadenza for clarinet alone which lends a nostalgic quality. The work contains five movements, each of which is in a different language: #Mrs. McGrath (Irish) #All the Pretty Little Horses (American) #Yerakina (Greek) #El Burro (Spanish) #A Fidler (Yiddish)  Lyrics  Each of the movements are based on popular folk poems originating from different countries.

It originally aired on Showtime on October 9, 2011. Brody begins to exhibit signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. Carrie continues to spy on Brody and gets a new lead on Abu Nazir's activity. Plot Brody (Damian Lewis) wakes up in a panic from a nightmare in which he was commanded by his al-Qaeda captors to bury his friend Tom Walker. He lies in bed sobbing while Carrie (Claire Danes) watches and takes notes from her home. The next morning, Jessica (Morena Baccarin) shows Brody that her arm has bruises all over it; while sleeping, he had grabbed her arm and was shouting in Arabic. His wife and kids go out and Brody is left alone for the day. He sinks into the corner of his bedroom and sits there in silence for the entire day, as though he is back in his cell in Iraq. Saul (Mandy Patinkin) visits a judge he has history with (Michael McKean). He apparently has some leverage over this judge and asks to be granted a FISA warrant, in order to make Carrie's surveillance of Brody technically legal. The judge reluctantly agrees. Saul also checks in with the CIA cryptography team, who were not able to decode Brody's coded message, if indeed it was a coded message. Saul then presents Carrie with the warrant temporarily legalizing her surveillance, which will be valid for four weeks. Carrie reports Brody's disturbing behavior to Saul, who says that if Brody had indeed been turned, then he would be embracing the hero role in the media. Lynne Reed (Brianna Brown), a consort of Prince Farid Bin Abbud (Amir Arison) of Saudi Arabia, is interviewing young women in Washington D.C. for the Prince's harem. She calls up a spa to make an appointment. In fact, the call is received by a CIA duty officer, who reports the call to Carrie, revealing that Lynne is a CIA informant working for Carrie. The next day, Carrie meets up with Lynne at the spa. Lynne reveals that she has recorded footage of Prince Farid meeting with Abu Nazir. Carrie reports these developments to David Estes (David Harewood) and requests agency protection for Lynne. Estes is pleased with the lead but denies the protection. He tells Carrie that Lynne needs to download the contents of the Prince's phone. Brody is in the kitchen when he spots a reporter lurking in his backyard. He goes out and tells the reporter he has ten seconds to get off his property. The reporter takes the opportunity to start asking Brody some questions instead. Brody violently strikes him in the throat while son Chris (Jackson Pace) watches in horror. Brody, looking disoriented, wanders off, eventually arriving at a mall. He enters a hardware store and browses for a while before eventually grabbing a small carpet. When Brody arrives home that night, he enters the garage and drops off his bag from the hardware store. Carrie and Virgil (David Marciano) are watching, but Virgil admits that they did not install any cameras in the garage. Mike (Diego Klattenhoff) talks to Brody after dinner, encouraging him to re-enlist, when he will be given a promotion and financially taken care of. Brody is insulted at the offer; he can tell that the higher-ups put Mike up to making this pitch, and that they want Brody to be the \\"poster boy\\". He angrily declares that his days of taking orders from the U.S. Government are over. Lynne is leaving a hotel when she is bumped into by Virgil, who on purpose spills tea on her. She goes to the bathroom to clean up, where Carrie is waiting for her. She gives Lynne the device needed to download the Prince's phone data hidden in a makeup compact. Carrie tries to set Lynne at ease, lying to her that Lynne is under 24/7 protection. Carrie visits her sister Maggie (Amy Hargreaves). Maggie is a psychiatrist and has been pilfering samples of an anti-psychotic medication to give to Carrie. Maggie expresses concern that she is jeopardizing her own practice by doing so, but Carrie says she has no other option, as if she pursued any kind of treatment on her own, her secret would be out and she would surely lose her security clearance with the CIA. Maggie gives her a week's supply of pills. A flashback is shown of Brody's time as a prisoner. Brody emerges from his cell and seems surprised by the fact that he is able to walk freely about the compound. He encounters a room full of worshipers in the middle of Muslim prayer and stops to watch them. Back in the present day, Brody heads to his garage. He puts his newly purchased carpet down on the floor and kneels down on it; he begins to pray, reciting Al-Fatiha from the Quran. Later that day, Brody goes outside in full uniform to talk to all of the media camped out in front of his house. Carrie is watching the cameras and excitedly calls Saul and tells him \\"It's happening, exactly like you said. He's out there playing the hero card!\\" Production The episode's teleplay was written by co-executive producer Alexander Cary, with story credit going to series co-creator Alex Gansa. Executive producer Michael Cuesta directed the episode, his second of four episodes he directed in the first season. Trivia In this episode when Brody is kneeling over the grave and singing the \\"Marines' Hymn\\", he sings \\"First to fight for right and country\\" and \\"We are proud to bear the title\\". The correct lyrics of the \\"Marines' Hymn\\" are \\"First to fight for right and freedom\\" and \\"We are proud to claim the title\\". The painting Saul comments on during his meeting with the judge is Mending the Nets by Dutch-Jewish painter Jozef Israëls. Reception Ratings The original broadcast had 940,000 viewers, down about 10% from the pilot episode. Reviews Scott Collura of IGN gave \\"Grace\\" an 8/10 score, and praised the development of the two lead characters. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that this episode successfully maintained the promise and high quality of the pilot.

It runs to the south from the port city of Wilhelmshaven to Oldenburg. The line is being upgraded in connection with the construction of JadeWeserPort so that it will be continuously duplicated and electrified. Route View over Wilhelmshaven station NordWestBahn DMU Sande station Varel station The Oldenburg–Wilhelmshaven line (VzG 1522) is currently duplicated with the exception of two sections, Varel–Jaderberg and Hahn–Rastede, and is designed for a top speed of 120 km/h. History The track was a joint project of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways and the Prussian state railways and was built together with the Oldenburg–Bremen line. It linked the Prussian naval base in Wilhelmshaven (then called Heppens) and opened up the north of the Grand Duchy. It was officially opened on 18 July 1867, but scheduled services started on 3 September 1867. The responsibility for the route was taken over in 1920 by the Reichsbahndirektion (Deutsche Reichsbahn railway division) of Oldenburg on 1 April 1920 when the Oldenburg State Railways were absorbed into Deutsche Reichsbahn. The line experienced its heyday during the time of Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1938-1939, as a result of Wilhelmshaven’s status as a navy base, the line was served, along with other services, by a high-speed diesel multiple unit (Schnellverkehrs-Triebwagen, abbreviated SVT) service called the SVT Hamburg, which ran each day from Wilhelmshaven to Berlin Lehrter Bahnhof and back via Oldenburg, Bremen, Langwedel, Uelzen, Salzwedel and Stendal. In the 1950s to the 1970s, there was a long-distance express train to Basel SBB and/or Zürich (sometimes continuing to Chur), as well as Frankfurt. There were also special long-distance trains at the weekend for conscripts returning home. Individual coaches also ran through to the Berlin Stadtbahn, Munich and Stuttgart. There were also, seasonal, so-called guest worker trains from Yugoslavia and Greece to Wilhelmshaven and vice versa. During the annual Hanover Fair a service called the Messe-Kapitän ran daily on the line to Hannover-Messe station; it originally only had first class accommodation, but second class was added later. In the 1970s, the long- distance passenger traffic gradually lost its importance. The long-distance trains terminated at Lindau, Munich, Stuttgart and Frankfurt. Before the introduction of Interregio services, City-D-Zug (connecting trains to the main long-distance express network) services operated. So four pairs of trains ran daily between Wilhelmshaven and Bremen to connect to the long-distance network in Bremen. An apparent prosperity followed with the introduction of Interregio services. Now, Berlin, Cottbus and Leipzig were connected directly to/from Wilhelmshaven, achieving modern levels of comfort. The subsequent elimination of Interregio services to Wilhelmshaven finally ended the status of the Wilhelmshaven–Oldenburg line as a long-distance line. In November 2000, the operation of passenger services was taken over by NordWestBahn. The contract was extended by twelve years by agreement in early 2005. The track is still owned by Deutsche Bahn. Until December 2002, one InterRegio service was operated by the long-distance arm of Deutsche Bahn network on the route towards Leipzig and Berlin. Today only Regionalbahn services run on the line. Passenger numbers have risen since 2000 by more than 50 percent. This is explained by a reliable regular-interval schedule, better connections and the use of comfortable multiple units. Prospects  The start of operations in JadeWeserPort from August 2012 will increase the volume of freight trains significantly, so it was decided to duplicate the two sections of single track amounting to 13 kilometres between Rastede and Hahn and between Jaderberg and Varel. In addition the line is being electrified as has been demanded for at least a decade. In August 2006 the Chairman of the Deutsche Bahn AG, Hartmut Mehdorn, gave a commitment to the then Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, Christian Wulff to electrify and duplicate the entire route by 2010. This project (duplication, raising the top speed to 120 km/h and electrification) was also incorporated into the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) of 2003 and was classified as a \\"priority project\\". The chances of implementation increased significantly again in November 2008, when the upgrade was included in the \\"Workplace Program for Construction and Transport\\" (Arbeitsplatzprogramm Bauen und Verkehr) of the federal government. A rail bypass of Sande, as required by its residents, is to be built at the earliest in 2015. Specifically, the planned works are as follows: *Continuous double-track lines (status as of September 2011: construction, renovation and upgrading started in August 2011) *Electrification (status as of September 2011: currently shelved, work may begin in 2013) *Upgrade of the Sande–Weißer Floh–Ölweiche section (status as of September 2011: some parts have been completed, but others have not yet begun). It was intended that the upgrade of the line be completed in August 2012 when JadeWeserPort is due to open. The original target, however, cannot be achieved. Recent statements give final completion dates between 2014 and 2016. Between early August 2011 and the timetable change in December 2012, the line between Rastede and Wilhelmshaven was closed for the upgrading of the line, including duplication. Operations between Rastede and Wilhelmshaven during this period was carried out by replacement buses operated by VWG Oldenburg, a partner of NordWestBahn. While the duplication meant that the top speed of 100 km/h could be implemented at the end of 2012, electrification of the line was initially postponed. Despite the long planning period and the fact that the track before the Second World War was already duplicated, significant problems in the ground conditions of the line had to be resolved, The maximum speed on the Rastede–Varel (Oldb) section of line was increased to 120 km/h at the timetable change December 2014. The opening of JadeWeserPort in September 2012 was expected to increase the volume of freight trains significantly. The plan envisaged an increase from eight to between 44 and 60 trains. This forecast has not been achieved because of the poor utilisation of the port so far. The electrification of the line has been delayed and according to recent planning is expected to be completed in 2018. The cost of these works is not yet known. Current operations  Normally the line is operated every hour with two-part Alstom Coradia LINT (class 41) diesel multiple units; depending on traffic coupled sets are operated. The average speed is 73 km/h and it achieves on this line nearly the quality of service of a Regional-Express. The vehicles are owned by the state and are leased by the Landesnahverkehrsgesellschaft (the public transport company of Lower Saxony) to NordWestBahn. Until 2000, Deutsche Bahn operated class 624 diesel multiple units and its InterRegio services were hauled by class 218 diesel locomotives until 2002. Fares  The trains can be used under an agreement between Deutsche Bahn and NordWestBahn with tickets available nationwide. Between Rastede and Oldenburg Central Station fares are set by the Verkehrsverbund Bremen/Niedersachsen (Transport Association of Bremen/Lower Saxony). Tickets for local trains can be bought from a machine on the train.

Today however he is mostly remembered as an art collector and for having founded the Wolfegger Kabinett. At the end of the Thirty Years' War Swedish troops under general Wrangel laid fire to Maximilian Willibald's home Schloss Wolfegg in 1646. As he lacked the funds for an immediate repair, he moved to Amberg, where he accepted the job as a governor of Upper Palatinate. In 1648 Maximilian Willibald married for the second time. His new wife was the Belgian Countess Clara Isabella of Arenberg, who possessed a keen interest in art. Their wedding celebrations saw the performance of armamentarium comicum amoris et honoris by Bartholomäus Aich, which is considered to be one of the oldest German operatic compositions. Maximilian Willibald himself was well educated in the liberal arts and spoke aside from his native German French, Italian and Latin as well. A chronicle of the house of Waldburg-Wolfegg from 1785 describes him as a \\"great lover of the secret and natural sciences like medicine, chemistry and alchemy\\" who has a keen interest in \\"all witty writings, poems and similar things in all known languages\\". Portrait of Clara Isabella of Arenberg From 1650 onwards Maximilian Willibald began to collect art systematically with a particular interest for graphics. He assembled a rather large collection over the years, in 1654 alone he acquired around 34,000 graphics from the inheritance of the Fugger family. At the time of his death his collection comprised over 120,000 graphics among them such famous pieces as the Kleiner Klebeband and the Mittelalterliches Hausbuch. In his will Maximilian Willibald ordained that his art collection was to kept as one and not to split over several heirs, therefore it remained virtually unchanged for the next 300 years. Also in his will he founded the Loreto Chapel in Wolfegg. Notes Lisa Zeitz: Großer Kleiner Klebeband . Arsprototo, Ausgabe 4/2011 (German) Andrea Reidt, Werner Sonntag: Allgäu.

He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the first Sunday after the Epiphany and first performed it on January 7th of 1725. It is based on the hymn \\"Meinen Jesum laß ich nicht\\" by Christian Keymann.  History and words  Bach wrote the chorale cantata in his second year in Leipzig for the First Sunday after Epiphany. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Epistle to the Romans, speaking of the duties of a Christian (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the finding in the Temple (). A year earlier, on the same occasion, Bach had reflected , from the point of view of a person who had lost Jesus. This cantata text is based on the chorale in six stanzas by Christian Keymann (1658). The text of the hymn begins, as in the former work, with an idea close to the gospel: the Christian does not want to let go of Jesus, as his parents had wished not to lose their 12-year-old boy, but then the chorale pursues the thought of being united with Jesus after death. An unknown poet kept the first and the last stanza, and paraphrased the inner stanzas to a sequence of as many recitatives and arias. Bach first performed the cantata on 7 January 1725, one day after , for Epiphany.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for four soloists, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, a four-part choir, horn to play the cantus firmus with the soprano, oboe d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (soprano, alto): # Chorale:  Music  In the opening chorus the soprano and the horn present line by line the , a melody by Andreas Hammerschmidt, who collaborated with Keymann on chorales. The lower voices are set mostly in homophony, while the orchestra plays its own themes in introduction, interludes and accompaniment. The character of the movement is a minuet, and the oboe d'amore takes a virtuosic concertante leading part. The phrase \\"\\" (cling to him like a burr) is illustrated by all three lower voices holding a note for three measures as if clinging to it. John Eliot Gardiner notes the \\"gentle, almost naïve tone of voice to reflect the submissive character of the text\\". A short secco recitative leads to a tenor aria, which is accompanied by the oboe, while the strings play \\"a persistent four-note drumming\\" to express \\"\\" (fear and terror). Alfred Dürr compares these repetitions to similar figures in the alto recitative \\"\\", movement 49 of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, Part V. In another secco recitative the term \\"\\" (after my completed course) is pictured by a scale spanning an octave. A duet of soprano and alto, only accompanied by the continuo, moves like a dance in simple periods of four measures. The cantata is closed by the final stanza in a four-part setting.

Battle  Soviet landing troops made a surprise attack on the skerry of Bengtskär with the goal to blow up the lighthouse situated on the skerry so that it would not disturb Soviet military operations. Finnish troops situated on the skerry managed to defend the lighthouse and eventually drove the Soviets back with the help of support troops. The landing was made with four MO-class patrol boats, while another 6 boats were later dispatched to retrieve the Soviet forces once it was clear the demolition attempt had failed. Finnish gunboats Uusimaa and Hämeenmaa engaged the Soviets, with Uusimaa sinking the patrol boat PK-238 with gunfire.  Results  The battle resulted in a Finnish victory, due to the intervention of the gunboats. 16 Soviet sailors were saved and captured from the sinking PK-238, while another 13 were captured on the Island. Some Soviet soldiers committed suicide with hand- grenades. Finnish estimates puts Soviet losses at 60 killed (40 of them on land), while Finnish suffered a loss of 16 men in the garrison and 4 men on the ships, while the next day a Soviet aerial bombing killed another 11 men waiting to be evacuated. Soviet sources report that the landing party consisted of only 31 men: casualties were 31 killed (including 8 sailors) and 24 prisoners (including 16 sailors).

Sjöström originally intended to film the entire suite, but decided to cancel the project after the second film received unenthusiastic critical response. Gustaf Molander picked up where Sjöström left and released his adaptation of the first book, Ingmarsarvet, in 1925, followed by the second, Till Österland, in 1926.

As well as being a sport and training aircraft, significant numbers have been used for agricultural spraying. It remained in production in 2015.Purdy, Don: AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition, page 113. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 71. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. Design and development The MAI-890 design originated and was developed by the Experimental Aircraft design section, known as OSKBES, of the School of Aeronautics at the MAI. From about 1990 the MAI design bureau became part of the Aviatika joint-stock company to facilitate aircraft production, so that for much of the 1990s the 890 was an Aviatika product. In 1998 MAI acquired the production rights from Aviatika and marketed it as the Aviatika- MAI-890. The starting point was the open cockpit, short span Junior which appeared in 1987 and developed into the full-span, enclosed seat prototype MAI-89 in 1989. The production prototype, designated MAI-890, followed the next year and production began in 1991. Since then two seat and agricultural versions have been produced. The MAI-890 has a structure of mixed aluminium, titanium and steel alloys and is fabric covered. It is an unequal span biplane with a straight lower wing of constant chord and some dihedral, which carries full span ailerons. The upper wing has greater span, some sweep but no dihedral, with constant chord over much of its span but with taper on the outer panels. It is a single bay biplane with one, slender interplane strut on each side assisted by flying wires; at its centre, the upper wing is fixed to the underwing engine mounting. Enclosed single or side-by-side seating is positioned ahead of the lower wing leading edge. A slender boom from the bottom of the fuselage pod carries the empennage; all tail surfaces are straight edged and strongly tapered and have generous control areas, with ground-adjustable trim tabs on the elevators. All current MAI-890 are powered by Rotax engines mounted in pusher configuration, the type depending on the aircraft variant and option. It has a short-legged, fixed tricycle undercarriage with cantilever main legs attached the boom behind the cabin. Operational history More than 300 aircraft were reported sold by 2006, about 60 of them agricultural variants, about 30 exported to South Africa. 26 MAI-89s and -890s appeared in the civil aircraft registers of European countries outside Russia in mid-2010.

Design and development In 1923 John G. Montijo collaborated with Lloyd Royer on a four-passenger aircraft, the California Coupe, that would become the first cabin biplane on the United States west coast. Montijo's design closely matched the Dayton- Wright OW.1 Aerial Coupe that he had recently purchased from the Rinehart- Whelan Company in Ohio. The aircraft was originally ordered on request of wealthy Dodge dealer C.E. Bellows with the intent on using a Liberty engine for power. While the California Coupe was under construction in the Kinner hangars, a client named Doc Young contracted Kinner to build a version for himself. The competing design, the Kinner Argonaut was built at the same time, with the goal to be completed before the California Coupe, with its first flight on 25 May 1924. The California Coupe was an enclosed biplane with conventional landing gear, fabric covered wings and very tall and narrow undercarriage that was built in a hangar rented from aircraft maker and engine producer Bert Kinner at Kinner Field. The Coupe, powered by a Wright-Hisso V-8 engine, was constructed using Haskelite bonded plywood and had a fuelheader tank in the upper mainplane, fed by a wind driven pump from a main fuel tank under the cabin. Operational history A novelty in the early 1920s was to get married in an aircraft. The California Coupe was used in an aerial wedding with its designer Montijo as the best man. During a 1925 filming of \\"Partners Again\\"Partners Again one of the 'Potash and Perlmutter' series of films at Clover Field in Santa Monica, a vehicle performing a stunt ran headlong into the California Coupe ripping off the main gear and one wing, sending it into a brick wall. Aftermath Montijo and Royer sued the film production company without success, so the California company was dissolved after the total loss of its major asset without compensation. Royer worked as a mechanic to pay off the rent owed to Kinner. Amelia Earhart, a close friend and employer of Royer, wrote to Royer asking him to keep some of the proceeds of the sale of her truck business after all the trouble he had with his aircraft venture. Kinner later loaned Royer $350 in 1927 to start his new aircraft production business building the Waterhouse and Royer Cruisair, which also did not go into production, but the plans were sold and used as the basis of the Ryan M-1. Montijo would go on to start another collaborative aircraft, the 1928 Warren & Montijo Monoplane.

Sheep wars occurred in many western states though they were most common in Texas, Arizona and the border region of Wyoming and Colorado. Generally, the cattlemen saw the sheepherders as invaders, who destroyed the public grazing lands, which they had to share on a first-come, first-served basis. Between 1870 and 1920, approximately 120 engagements occurred in eight different states or territories. At least 54 men were killed and some 50,000 to over 100,000 sheep were slaughtered. History Texas Cattle ranching was already a well established trade in Texas by 1870, when shepherding was starting to become popular in other parts of the Old West. Because of this, in Texas and elsewhere, many cattlemen had close relationships with local government figures and they were able to use this influence to their advantage. According to one unnamed Texas historian, \\"In court action, the cowboy [cattleman] usually won.\\" The sheepherders were always considered the weaker, or lesser, of the antagonists. They were often advocates of free grazing on public land, while the cattlemen typically fenced off the territory whether it was public or private land. There were many reasons why a cattle rancher would build fences, mostly it was to mark boundaries, prevent rustling, and to keep other people from grazing their animals there. Furthermore, there was also the threat of sheep scab. Building fences across the range infuriated the sheep herders, as well as open range cattlemen, so conflicts like the Fence Cutting War became almost inevitable. Racism was also a factor, being that many of the shepherds were either Hispanic or Native American. One of the earliest sheep wars was fought in 1875, in the Charles Goodnight range, along the Texas-New Mexico border. Later, sheep wars occurred in the central and West Texas counties of Schleicher, Nolan, Brown, Crane, Tom Green, San Saba and Coleman.Elman, pg. 38 On March 9, 1881, the state of Texas passed a law authorizing the appointment of sheep inspectors, who were to quarantine sheep infected with sheep scab (mange). However, the law only drove the sheepherders \\"under cover.\\" There were also laws passed that prevented sheepherders from grazing on public land entirely. Enforcement was largely ineffective though, because there were no representatives of the General Land Office in West Texas. In April 1883, another law was passed that called for sheepherders to present a certificate showing that their herd had been inspected for scabies before crossing any county borders. Cutting fences became a felony in 1884 and, around the same time, West Texas experienced a land rush, which sealed off many sheep and cattlemen from accessing public land. In some cases, sheepherders were forced to cut fences and cross into private property in order to reach public land but, eventually, \\"a type of code was evolved that required the herder to drive his flocks at least five miles a day on level terrain or at least three miles a day in rougher country [when crossing private land].\\" Compared to other American states, the level of violence in the Texas sheep wars was minimal. Arizona Of all the range wars in American history, the Pleasant Valley War in Arizona was the most costly. It was fought between the families of John D. Tewksbury and Tom Graham. Though both the Tewksbury and Graham families were cattle ranchers, the former supported the sheepherders when they began entering Pleasant Valley in 1885. The sudden appearance of large flocks of sheep on public land, that had been previously used exclusively for cattle, was unnerving for many cowboys, so they \\"began to unite in defending their range against the sheep.\\" By 1886 it was illegal for sheepherders to move their herds within two miles of cattle grazing land and the Mogollon Rim was an unofficial border, or deadline, which no sheep were permitted south of. Pleasant Valley was located beyond the border so when the Daggs Brothers and the Tewksburys began moving in sheep, the local cattle ranchers, such as the Grahams, resisted violently by attacking the sheepherders. The Grahams and the Tewksburys had been feuding since 1882 but the first bloodshed wasn't until 1885 when John D. Tewksbury leased a herd of sheep from the Daggs Brothers and had it driven into Pleasant Valley by a Basque sheepherder. Somewhere along the trail, the sheepherder was ambushed and killed by Andy Cooper, a member of the Graham faction and associate of the Hashknife cowboys, who were also in conflict with sheepherders. A second incident occurred in February 1887. An Ute shepherd was beheaded about two miles north of the Graham Ranches while he was driving some of the Daggs' sheep through the area. Though no one was ever charged, Tom Graham is believed to have been responsible. The United States Army later dispatched Indian scouts to follow the murderer's trail and, according to author Leland J. Hanchett, the tracks led to Tom's cabin.Hanchett, pg. 37-41 The situation escalated into a gunfight at the Middleton Ranch on August 9, 1887.Hanchett, pg. 50 The ranch was owned by a man named George Newton, who was a family friend of the Tewksburys. Members of the Graham faction and some Hashknife cowboys were out searching for Mart Blevins, dead or alive, and they assumed the Tewksburys knew something about his disappearance. The group included five men and was led by Hampton Blevins, the son of Mart and the half-brother of Andy Cooper, who killed the Basque sheepherder. Three of the other men were the Hashknife cowboys John Payne, Thomas Carrington and Robert Glaspie. The final man was another cowboy named Tom Tucker. There were six men occupying the Middleton Ranch when Blevins' party arrived, three of whom were Tewksburys. At first, Blevins' party approached the ranch house and requested food for the night but, at some point, they rode off and began shooting towards the house. However, other accounts say that the first shots were fired from the men inside the house. What is known is that Hamton and John Payne were dead, without loss to the Tewksbury's side. Tucker and Glaspie were also wounded and Carrington \\"escaped with his clothing perforated by a bullet.\\" A clear defeat for the Graham faction, the war turned into a long series of revenge killings and had little to do with sheep after the first encounters. By the time the war ended, in 1892, about twenty-five people had been killed, including all of the men in the Graham family and most of the Blevins and the Tewksbury families.Hanchett, pg.53-55 There were other sheep wars in Arizona, besides the Graham-Tewksbury feud. In 1884, near the San Francisco Mountain, angry cattlemen rounded up over 100 wild horses, strapped cowbells to their necks, rawhide to their tails, and then drove them into a series of sheep herds numbering more than 25,000, yelling and firing guns in the process. The sheep scattered in all directions, many were killed or wounded and it took a week to gather up and separate the surviving stock. That same year, cowboys drove over 4,000 sheep into the Little Colorado River, many of which died in quicksand. Wyoming and Colorado link=Special:FilePath/The_Plains_Herder_NC_Wyeth.png The sheep wars in Wyoming and Colorado were exceptionally violent and lasted until well after the turn of the century. Like in Texas and Arizona, the cattlemen of Colorado were unwilling to share their pastures with the sheepherders, who were crossing into the state from southern Wyoming. In Wyoming alone there were about twenty-four attacks and at least six deaths between 1879 and 1909, though other accounts say that over sixteen people were killed. The most well known of the conflicts was the Routt County Sheep War,Barth, pg. 261 in which the cattlemen of Routt County, Colorado attempted to keep the Wyoming sheepherders from entering their grazing ranges. On May 23, 1895, the newspaper Cheyenne Leader reported that four days previously \\"riders were sent out to scour the country and warn the settlers that sheepmen now holding their flocks on Snake River at the Wyoming line [border], were contemplating an invasion of the Bear River cattle ranges. The effect was electrical, and by noon today fully 350 cattlemen and feeders were assembled to decide upon positive action to keep the sheep back....\\" Shortly after that, the cattlemen adopted a series of resolutions that established deadlines and effectively banned all sheepherders from entering northwestern Colorado. However, the Cheyenne Leader reported that the sheepherders would most likely disregard the ban and enter the state anyway. To enforce the resolutions, the newspaper said, the \\"stock feeders and cowboys [cattlemen], with a force of eight hundred to a thousand are holding themselves in readiness forcibly to resist any advance made south of Hahn’s Peak by the sheep owners.... A war is imminent and unless the more conservative heads prevail, the rifle will figure a conspicuous part in a Routt County sheep war. The sheep that are causing the trouble are some sixty thousand head belonging to J. G. and G.W. Edwards and others in Wyoming.\\"Pitcher, pg. 573 Despite the newspaper's claim, most of the sheepherders respected the cattlemen's resolve, which defused the situation before it became too serious. There were, however, at least four violent episodes in the region during the time. The first occurred in 1894, in Garfield County, when 3,800 sheep were driven over cliffs into Parachute Creek. The sheepherder, Carl Brown, attempted to stop the cowboys from killing the flock but he was shot in his hip. When a posse from Parachute, Colorado rode out to the scene, they found the wounded Brown and a \\"mass of dead sheep at the foot of a 1,000-foot bluff.\\" The Craig Courier reported the following on September 14, 1894; \\"The owners [of the sheep] are residents of Parachute with rights to the adjacent range and the posse made a futile race to apprehend the raiders. John Miller owned seventeen hundred of the sheep and Charles Brown, uncle of the wounded man, twenty-one hundred.\\" About 1,500 more sheep were massacred the same year in the same county. According to Jack Edwards of Wyoming, in late June 1896, two of his sheepherders were killed by Colorado cowboys and 300 of his herd was massacred. Upon learning of the raid, Edwards headed towards the scene but he was intercepted by a \\"party of masked men,\\" who ordered him to remove the rest of his flock back across the border. After the raid, on January 23, 1897, Edwards told an Omaha reporter the following; \\"I have an armed force of about fifty [men] ready for the clash when it comes. I am compelled to keep a small army about my place all the time. A short time ago three hundred sheep were killed and two herders; for a while it looked as though the entire Colorado militia would have to be called out, but the sheepmen and cattlemen looked out for themselves, and there are several graves in the vicinity of Meeker that go to show that they know how to do this.\\" Another incident took place on the morning of November 15, 1899, when forty masked men attacked a sheep camp located on the lower Snake River. During the foray, over 3,000 sheep were \\"clubbed and scattered\\", the shepherds were robbed and their wagon was burned. Some of the more serious raids, outside of the northwestern Colorado area, occurred in 1887, 1896, 1902, 1905 and 1909. In 1887, nearly 2,600 heads belonging to Charles Herbert perished when some cowboys burned down his corrals at Tie Siding, Wyoming. In 1896 in Wyoming, about 12,000 sheep were slaughtered in a single night by being driven off a cliff near North Rock Springs. The violence reached its height after the turn of the century. In 1902, near Thermopolis, Wyoming, several thousand sheep were slaughtered and their herders killed. During the summer of 1905, ten masked men attacked a sheep camp on Shell Creek, in the Big Horn Basin. There the cowboys clubbed about 4,000 sheep, out of 7,000, burned the wagons and two sheep dogs. The owner of the massacred flock, Louis A. Gantz, lost about $40,000 as a result. Out of all the sheep raids, the most serious incursion was the Spring Creek Raid of April 2, 1909. Just southwest of Ten Sleep, Wyoming, the sheepherder Joe Allemand and two of his companions were shot and killed by seven or eight masked men. The raiders also killed about twenty-five sheep and two dogs, and burned the wagons with kerosene. Because sheep raiders had never been prosecuted in a Wyoming court before, many believed that the murderers would get away with the massacre. However, seven men were eventually arrested, five of whom were sent to prison. The conviction of the Ten Sleep murderers brought peace to Big Horn County. After the 1909 attack, cattlemen were reluctant to raid sheep camps because now they risked being punished for it. Though there were two more Wyoming sheep raids in 1911 and 1912, no more sheepherders were murdered. The last known sheep raid in Colorado occurred eight years later, in 1920, when 150 sheep were slaughtered for grazing in the White River National Forest.Elman, pg. 38–39 According to Robert Elman, author of Badmen of the West, the sheep wars ended because of the decline of open rangeland and changes in ranching practices, which removed the causes for hostilities. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 also eased some of the tension.Elman, pg. 39 See also * Sheepshooters' War * Railroad Wars * Coal Wars * County seat war * Range war * Oklahoma!

Canada has two official languages, and distinct comics cultures have developed in English and French Canada. The English tends to follow American trends, and the French Franco- Belgian ones, with little crossover between the two cultures. Canadian comics run the gamut of comics forms, including editorial cartooning, comic strips, comic books, graphic novels, and webcomics, and are published in newspapers, magazines, books, and online. They have received attention in international comics communities and have received support from the federal and provincial governments, including grants from the Canada Council for the Arts. There are comics publishers throughout the country, as well as large small press, self- publishing, and minicomics communities. In English Canada many cartoonists, from Hal Foster to Todd McFarlane, have sought to further their careers by moving to the United States; since the late 20th century increasing numbers have gained international attention while staying in Canada. During World War II, trade restrictions led to the flourishing of a domestic comic book industry, whose black-and-white \\"Canadian Whites\\" contained original stories of heroes such as Nelvana of the Northern Lights as well as American scripts redrawn by Canadian artists. The war's end saw American imports and domestic censorship lead to the death of this industry. The alternative and small press communities grew in the 1970s, and by the end of the century Dave Sim's Cerebus and Chester Brown's comics, amongst others, gained international audiences and critical acclaim, and Drawn and Quarterly became a leader in arts-comics publishing. In the 21st century, comics have gained wider audiences and higher levels of recognition, especially in the form of graphic novels and webcomics. In French Canada indigenous comics are called BDQ or ' () Cartoons with speech balloons in Quebec date to the late 1700s. BDQ have alternately flourished and languished throughout Quebec's history as the small domestic market has found it difficult to compete with foreign imports. Many cartoonists from Quebec have made their careers in the United States. Since the Springtime of BDQ in the 1970s native comics magazines, such as Croc and Safarir, and comics albums have become more common, though they account for only 5% of total sales in the province. Since the turn of the 21st century cartoonists such as Michel Rabagliati, Guy Delisle, and the team of Dubuc and Delaf have seen international success in French-speaking Europe and in translation. Éditions Mille-Îles and La Pastèque are amongst the domestic publishers that have become increasingly common. History English Canada Prime Minister John A. Macdonald was a favourite target of John Bengough's popular caricatures. =Early history (1759–1910s)= Brigadier- General George Townshend's cartoons lampooning General James Wolfe in 1759 are recognized as the first examples of political cartooning in Canadian history. Cartoons did not have a regular forum in Canada until John Henry Walker's short-lived weekly Punch in Canada débuted in Montreal in 1849. The magazine was a Canadian version of Britain's humorous Punch and featured cartoons by Walker. It paved the way for a number of similar short-lived publications, until the success of the more straight-laced Canadian Illustrated News, published by George-Édouard Desbarats beginning in 1869, soon after Canadian Confederation. In 1873, John Wilson Bengough founded Grip, a humour magazine in the style of Punch and the American Harper's Weekly. It featured a large number of cartoons, especially Bengough's own. The cartoons tended to be political, and Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and Métis rebel leader Louis Riel were favourite targets. The Pacific Scandal in the early 1870s gave Bengough much fodder to raise his reputation as a political caricaturist. According to historian John Bell, while Bengough was probably the most significant pre-20th-century Canadian cartoonist, Henri Julien was likely the most accomplished. Published widely both at home and abroad, Julien's cartoons appeared in periodicals such as Harper's Weekly and Le Monde illustré. In 1888, he gained employment at the Montreal Star and became the first full-time newspaper cartoonist in Canada. Palmer Cox had an international hit with The Brownies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Palmer Cox, a Canadian expatriate in the United States, at this time created The Brownies, a popular, widely merchandised phenomenon whose first book collection sold over a million copies. Cox began a Brownies comic strip in 1898 that was one of the earliest English-language strips, and had begun to use speech balloons by the time it ended in 1907. =Age of comic strips (1920s–1930s)= Jimmy Frise's Birdseye Center (later Juniper Junction) was the longest-running strip in English Canada Canadian cartoonists often found it hard to succeed in the field of comic strips without moving to the US, but in 1921, Jimmy Frise, one of Ernest Hemingway's drinking buddies during the journalist's days in Toronto, sold Life's Little Comedies to the Toronto Stars Star Weekly. This strip was later retitled Birdseye Center, and became the longest-running strip in English Canadian history. In 1947, Frise brought the strip to the Montreal Standard, where it was renamed Juniper Junction. Nova Scotia-born artist J. R. Williams single-panel strip about rural and small-town life, Out Our Way, began in 1922 and was syndicated in 700 newspapers at its peak. Two new comic strips appeared on the same day in 1929 in American newspapers and fed the public's desire for escapist entertainment at the dawn of the Great Depression. They were the first non-humorous adventure strips, and both were adaptations. One was Buck Rogers; the other, Tarzan, by Halifax native Hal Foster, who had worked as illustrator for catalogues from Eaton's and the Hudson's Bay Company before moving to the US in his late 20s. Other adventure strips soon followed and paved the way for the genre diversity that was seen in comic strips in the 1930s. In 1937, Foster began his own strip, Prince Valiant, which has become his best-known work for Foster's dextrous, realistic artwork. After struggling to support himself at various Toronto-based publications, Richard Taylor, under the pen name \\"Ric\\", became a regular at The New Yorker and relocated to the US, where the pay and opportunities for cartoonists were better. The Toronto Telegram began to run Men of the Mounted in 1933, the first home-grown adventure strip, written by Ted McCall and drawn by Harry Hall. McCall later penned the strip Robin Hood and Company, which made its appearance in comic books when McCall founded Anglo-American Publishing in 1941. =Golden age: Canadian Whites (1940s)= The Golden Age of Comic Books and subsequent superhero boom began with the release in June 1938 of Action Comics #1. The cover story was the first appearance of Superman, drawn by Toronto-born Joe Shuster. Shuster modeled Superman's Metropolis after his memories of Toronto, and the newspaper Clark Kent worked for after the Toronto Daily Star, which he had delivered as a child. These comics crossed the border and quickly gained Canadian fans as well. In December 1940, the War Exchange Conservation Act was passed. It restricted the importation of goods from the US that were deemed non-essential to combat the trade deficit Canada had with its neighbours to the south. American comic books were casualties of the Act. In 1941, to fill the void, a number of Canadian comic book publishers sprang up, starting in March with Anglo- American Publishing in Toronto and Maple Leaf Publishing in Vancouver. Adrian Dingle's Hillborough Studios and Bell Features soon joined them. The comics printed by these companies had colour covers, but the innards were in black- and-white, and thus collectors call them Canadian Whites. Superheroes stories were prominent, and the \\"Whites\\" often relied on serials to keep readers coming back for more. Better Comics from Maple Leaf and Robin Hood and Company from Anglo-American were the first titles to hit the stands. Robin Hood was a tabloid-sized comic strip reprint magazine, while Better was made up of original material in traditional comic-book format, and thus can be said to be the first true Canadian comic book. It included the appearance of the first Canadian superhero, Vernon Miller's Iron Man. John Stables, under the pen name John St. Ables, was responsible for Brok Windsors debut in Better in the spring of 1944—a fantasy-adventure set far in the \\"land beyond the mists\\" in the Canadian North. The success of Better led to a proliferation of titles from Maple Leaf. Adrian Dingle's Nelvana of the Northern Lights, Canada's first female superhero The driving creative forces behind Anglo-American were Ted McCall, the writer of the Men of the Mounted and Robin Hood strips, and artist Ed Furness. The pair created a number of heroes with such names as Freelance, Purple Rider, Red Rover, and Commander Steel. Anglo-American also published stories based on imported American scripts bought from Fawcett Publications, with fresh artwork by Canadians to bypass trade restrictions. Captain Marvel and Bulletman were amongst the characters that had Canadian adaptations. Anglo-American published a large number of titles, including Freelance, Grand Slam, Three Aces, Whiz, Captain Marvel and Atom Smasher, but relied less on serials, and was less patriotically Canadian than its rival publishers. It employed a number of talented artists, but they were kept to a \\"house style\\" of drawing, in the vein of Captain Marvel's C. C. Beck. In August 1941, three unemployed artists, Adrian Dingle and André and René Kulbach, formed Hillborough Studios to publish their own work. They started with Triumph-Adventure Comics, whose star was Canada's first female superhero, Nelvana of the Northern Lights, who appeared several months before Wonder Woman did in the US. Nelvana was inspired by tribal stories brought back from the Arctic Group of Seven painter Franz Johnston. The popular fur-miniskirted superheroine was a powerful Inuit mythological figure, daughter of a mortal woman and Koliak the Mighty, King of the Northern Lights. She had telepathic powers and was able to ride the Northern Lights at the speed of light, turn invisible, and melt metal. In March 1942, Dingle and most of the Hillborough staff moved with Nelvana to Toronto-based Bell Features, which had begun publishing comics in September 1941 with the first issue of the successful Wow Comics—in colour at first, but Bell soon switched to the familiar \\"White\\" format. Bell was the most prolific of the Canadian comic-book publishers. Its comics were drawn by a large pool of artists, including freelancers, adolescents, and women, and were unabashedly Canadian. Aside from Nelvana, there were Edmund Legault's Dixon of the Mounted, Jerry Lazare's Phantom Rider, and Fred Kelly's Doc Stearne. Leo Bachle's Johnny Canuck was the second Canadian national hero, and debuted in Bell's Dime Comics in February 1942. The new Canadian comics were successful; Bell reached accumulated weekly sales of 100,000 by 1943. By this time, Educational Projects of Montréal had joined, selling comics in the \\"White\\" format. Educational specialized in a different sort of fare: biographies of prime ministers, cases of the RCMP, and historical tales, drawn by accomplished artists including George M. Rae and Sid Barron. Educational's Canadian Heroes earned endorsements from cabinet ministers and appealed to parents and educators, but was not as appealing to the kids it was aimed at until Rae convinced publisher Harry J. Halperin to allow him to include a fictional character, Canada Jack—a hero who battled Nazis. With the end of World War II in 1945, Canadian comic-book publishing faced competition from American publishers again. Educational and latecomer Feature Publications folded immediately. Maple Leaf tried to compete by switching to colour and by trying to break into the British market. Anglo- American and another newcomer, Al Rucker Publications, tried to compete directly with the Americans, and even achieved distribution in the US. By the end of 1946 it was clear that the remaining publishers could not compete, and for the time being original comic-book publishing came to an end in Canada, although some publishers like Bell Features survived by republishing American books until the War Exchange Conservation Act was officially abolished in 1951. The cartoonists who insisted on drawing for a living faced several choices: some moved across the border to attempt to make it with the American publishers, and some moved into illustration work, as Jerry Lazare, Vernon Miller, Jack Tremblay, and Harold Bennett did. Another avenue was the route Sid Barron followed into political cartooning. By 1949, out of 176 comics titles on the newsstand, only 23 were Canadian. =Post-war (late 1940s–early 1970s)= With the end of most original Canadian comic book publishing in 1947, Canada's superheroes disappeared, and the country entered a phase of foreign comic book domination. In November 1948, a crime comics scare hit the country when a pair of voracious comic book readers in Dawson Creek, British Columbia, shot at a random car while playing highwaymen, fatally wounding a passenger. When authorities discovered their taste for comic books, media attention focused on the emerging crime comics genre as an influence on juvenile delinquency. A bill to amend Section 207 of the Criminal Code was drafted, and passed unanimously, making it an offense to make, print, publish, distribute, sell, or own \\"any magazine, periodical or book which exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially the commission of crimes, real or fictitious\\", on 10 December 1949. Comics publishers across Canada banded together to create the Comic Magazine Industry Association of Canada (CMIAC), a Canadian industry self-censoring body similar to the American Comics Code Authority that would be formed a few years later in response to a similar crime comics scare in the U.S. Purely by coincidence, the Netherlands had experienced a near-similar comics related incident at almost the exact same time with an equally lethal outcome, and causing a similar popular reaction, but in this case the authorities refrained from taking the drastic legal actions, their Canadian counterparts did. Superior Publishers, however, defied the ban, while also moving into the U.S. market. Watchdogs turned up the heat, and in 1953 a distributor was found guilty of distributing obscenities. Some of Superior's titles found themselves in Fredric Wertham's notorious and influential diatribe on the influence comics had on juvenile delinquency, Seduction of the Innocent, published in 1954. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, established in 1953, had public hearings a few months later, and called upon Kamloops, British Columbia Member of Parliament E. Davie Fulton, one of Superior publisher William Zimmerman's most outspoken enemies, as a witness. The Comics Code Authority was soon formed, and Superior, like fellow American publisher EC Comics, saw their sales dwindle throughout 1955. Prosecutions increased throughout Canada, with Superior successfully defending themselves in one, and another supposedly comics-related murder was reported in Westville, Nova Scotia. Superior shut its doors in 1956, and until the 1970s, English Canadian newsstand comic book publishing was no more, although a number of \\"giveaway\\" comics continued to be produced by Orville ' Productions and Owen McCarron's Comic Book World, who produced the educational and cautionary comics for governments and corporations, aimed at kids and teens. Doug Wright's Nipper was a mainstay in Canadian newspapers in the post-war years The crackdown was not aimed at comic strips, however, and several notable new ones appeared, like Lew Saw's One-Up, Winslow Mortimer's Larry Brannon and Al Beaton's Ookpik. After Jimmy Frise's death in 1948, Juniper Junction was taken over by Doug Wright, \\"one of Canada's best post-war comic-strip artists\\". He would continue with the strip until 1968, while also working on his own Nipper from 1949. In 1967, Nipper became Doug Wright's Family when Wright moved from Montreal to Ontario, and the popular strip continued until 1980. The Doug Wright Awards were inaugurated in his honour in 2005. From 1948 to 1972, James Simpkins' cartoon Jasper the Bear appeared continuously in Maclean's magazine. Jasper was hugely popular across Canada and was used, and is still today, as the symbol for Jasper National Park. To express his anger at the US military's nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll in 1946 English-born artist Laurence Hyde produced a wordless novel in 1951 called Southern Cross. In 118 silent pages, the book depicts atomic testing by the US military and its effects Polynesian island inhabitants. While it had no direct effect on comics at the time, it has come to be seen as a precursor to the Canadian graphic novel. Early editorial cartooning lacked a local flavour, tending to be a pale imitation of American examples. It tended to be cheery, non-confrontational, and supported good causes. Following the War it broke from typical American clichés and took on more of a savage bite, especially compared to the more allegorical tendencies of American editorial cartoons. At Le Devoir, Robert Lapalme was the first to cartoon in this particularly Canadian idiom, and in 1963 organized an International Salon of Caricature and Cartoon in Montreal. Lapalme was later followed by Duncan Macpherson at the Toronto Star, Leonard Norris at the Vancouver Sun and Ed McNally at the Montreal Star. These cartoonists frequently took political positions contrary to those of the papers in which they were published. Macpherson drew a cartoon of John Diefenbaker as Marie Antoinette saying \\"Let them eat cake\\" in response to the Prime Minister's cancelling the Avro Arrow project, which historian Pierre Burton has called the beginning of Canadians' disillusionment with Diefenbaker's government. Macpherson in particular fought fiercely for editorial independence, challenging his editors and threatening to quit the Star if not given his way, which paved a new path for other cartoonists to follow. In the spring of 1966, Canada saw its first specialty comic shop open its doors on Queen Street West, Toronto: Viking Bookshop, established by \\"Captain George\\" Henderson. Entirely unfamiliar with the new phenomenon, the store was dubbed \\"the campiest store in town\\" by Toronto Star reporter Robert Fulford. No longer in existence, Viking Bookshop is currently the earliest known such specialty comic book store in North-America (or worldwide for that matter), predating the oldest known US comic book store, Gary Arlington's San Francisco Comic Book Company (est. April 1968), by two years. One year later, in May 1967, the store was renamed Memory Lane Books after it had relocated to Markham Street in the same city, and as such became an inspiration for pioneering retailer Harry Kremer and Bill Johnson to open Now & Then Books in Kitchener, Ontario. Its newsletter, the Now and Then Times, published early work by the young Dave Sim in its inaugural issue in 1972, and later employed him from 1976 to 1977. In the late 1960s, along with the countercultural movement, a new form of comic art appeared from the avant-garde and literary scenes—underground comics (or \\"comix\\") aimed at an adult audience. Early examples appeared in certain magazines, but an early precursor of Canadian underground comic books was Scraptures, as a special issue of the Toronto avant-garde literary magazine grOnk in 1967. In 1969, Canada saw its first true underground comics, with SFU Komix and Snore Comix. These comix drew their inspiration from the American underground movement that exploded after the release of Robert Crumb's Zap in early 1968. Martin Vaugh-James produced an early graphic novel when he had Elephant released by Press Porcépic in 1970. The underground movement paralleled that of the US, in that it peaked from 1970 to 1972 with the peak of the counterculture, and witnessed a sharp decline afterward. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan's Dave Geary and Vancouver, British Columbia's Rand Holmes were key figures, Holmes being the creator of the Harold Hedd comic strip. Humour magazine Fuddle Duddle, named after a famous euphemism by then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was a short lived attempt at a Canadian Mad-style satirical magazine. It was the first comic book of Canadian content to be available on newsstands since 1956. Two of its contributors, Peter Evans and Stanley Berneche, would soon go on to bring superheroes back to Canada for the first time since the demise of Nelvana in 1947, with Captain Canuck. The fan press and fandom grew throughout this period, and was bolstered when Patrick Loubert and Michael Hirsh, the founders of the animation company Nelvana, published of The Great Canadian Comic Books in 1971, a book-length study of the Bell Features comics, and the touring of a related exhibition mounted by the National Gallery of Canada, Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941-45, which together served to introduce English- Canadian comics creators and fans to their lost heritage. Towards the middle of the 1970s, comics aimed at children gradually disappeared. The new breed of underground, alternative and independent comics was aimed at a more mature audience, which ran counter to the public's perception, as well as to legal restrictions. The first wave of alternative comics in the seventies was largely made up of science fiction and fantasy comics, made by budding cartoonists like Gene Day, Dave Sim, Augustine Funnell, Jim Craig, Ken Steacy, Dean Motter, and Vincent Marchesano. =New wave (mid-1970s–1980s)= The mid-1970s saw the beginning of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene. The comics magazines showing up in Canada at the time suffered from promotion and distribution problems, however, getting most of their support from the fan press. Phil Seuling's California-based comics distributor Bud Plant was supportive of these underground and alternative comics, though, and helped get them into stores. Eventually, distributors like Bud Plant and the emergence of specialty comic shops would form a distribution network for small press comics that would thrive independently of the traditional newsstands. Lynn Johnston's For Better or For Worse, the most widely distributed Canadian comic strip The world of comic strips saw a number of works pop up. Ben Wicks was doing The Outsiders and Wicks, Jim Unger's Herman debuted in 1975, and Ted Martin's Pavlov in 1979. In 1978, Lynn Johnston, living in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, began For Better or For Worse, which was noted for following the lives of the Patterson family as they grew older in real time, and dealt with real-life issues. The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, as well as social issues such as the midlife crisis, divorce, the coming out of a gay character, child abuse, and death. In 1985, she became the first female cartoonist to win a Reuben Award, and the Friends of Lulu added her to the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 2002. The strip was very popular, appearing in over 2000 newspapers in 25 countries. Editorial cartoonists held considerable sway between the 1950s through the 1970s. Former Prime Minister Joe Clark has been quoted that he lost votes in the election of 1980 due to political cartoons about him. They have also experienced the fear of censorship through the courts, or \\"libel chill\\". In 1979, Robert Bierman and the Victoria Times was the subject of a libel suit when he criticized the policies of William Vander Zalm, the British Columbia Minister of Human Resources, with a cartoon of the Minister pulling the wings off flies. When the courts ruled in Vander Zalm's favour, newspapers across the nation ran their own versions of the cartoon in support, until the BC Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in 1980, deeming the cartoon \\"fair comment\\". It was later acquired by the National Archives of Canada. Dave Sim proselytized self-publishing and creators' rights while pushing artistic boundaries with his series, Cerebus. Captain Canuck and Orb both folded by 1976, but in Kitchener, Ontario in December 1977, Dave Sim's independent comic book Cerebus debuted, and would become the longest-lived original Canadian comic book. Benefiting from distribution in the emerging comic shop market, it started as a Howard the Duck-like parody of Barry Windsor-Smith's Conan the Barbarian comics. The story eventually grew to fit Sim's expanding ambitions, both in content and technique, with its earth-pig protagonist getting embroiled in politics, becoming prime minister of a powerful city-state, then a Pope who ascends to the moon—all within the first third of its projected 300-issue run. Sim came to conceive the series as a self-enclosed story, which itself would be divided into novels—or graphic novels, which were gaining in prominence in the North American comic book world in the 1980s and 1990s. While Sim and his partner Gerhard's technical achievements impressed and influenced his peers, Sim also spoke out for creators' rights, promoted his peers and up-and-coming creators, and fiercely promoted self-publishing as an ideal. Americans Jeff Smith with Bone and Terry Moore with Strangers in Paradise took Sim's cue, as did Canadian M'Oak (Mark Oakley) with his long- running Thieves and Kings. Eddie Campbell took Sim's personal advice to self- publish the collected From Hell at the turn of the century. Sim also stirred considerable controversy, sometimes with the content of Cerebus, and sometimes with his editorials and personal interactions. David Boswell was amongst those in the 1980s who made the jump from the fanzine world when he began self- publishing Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman in 1980. From out of the same scene, Bill Marks started publishing the anthology Vortex in Toronto in 1982. Marks' Vortex Comics expanded into publishing other comics. The publisher gained publicity for Mister X, which employed the talents of Dean Motter, Gilberto and Jaime Hernandez and, later, Torontonians Seth and Jeffrey Morgan. Most notably, Marks picked up Chester Brown's Yummy Fur, a taboo- breaking series which started in 1983 as a self-published, photocopied minicomic. It had generated some buzz, and Vortex started publishing it professionally at the end of 1986. Yummy Furs stories were a mix of genres, with the improvised, surreal Ed the Happy Clown, straight adaptations of the Gospels, and revealing, bare-all autobiographical stories. Brown would become a major figure in Canadian comics. As the content of comics matured throughout the 1980s, they became the subject of increasing scrutiny. In 1986, Calgary comic shop Comic Legends was raided and charged with obscenity. In response, Derek McCulloch and Paul Stockton of Strawberry Jam Comics established the Comic Legends Legal Defense Fund to help retailers, distributors, publishers, and creators fight against obscenity charges. To raise funds, they published two True North anthologies of Canadian talent. During this time, large numbers of Canadian artists were making waves in the American comic book market as well, such as John Byrne, Gene Day and his brother Dan, Jim Craig, Rand Holmes, Geof Isherwood, Ken Steacy, Dean Motter, George Freeman and Dave Ross. Byrne was particularly popular for his work on X-Men, and also originated Alpha Flight, about a team of Canadian superheroes. =1990s= In 1990, Montreal-based publisher Drawn and Quarterly began with an anthology title also named Drawn and Quarterly. It quickly picked up a number of other titles, such as Julie Doucet's semi-autobiographical, bilingual Dirty Plotte, which, like Yummy Fur, had started out as a minicomic; Seth's Palookaville; illegal resident from the US Joe Matt's Peepshow; and Yummy Fur, which made the jump with its twenty-fifth issue. At the time, an autobiographical comics trend took place. Brown, Seth and Matt in particular were thought of as a Toronto comics rat pack, depicting one another in their comics and doing signings and interviews together. Drawn and Quarterly was at the forefront of the maturation comic books saw in the 1990s, publishing and promoting the works of adult-oriented Canadian and international artists. The publisher avoided genres like superheroes, which publisher Chris Oliveros saw as stifling comics' growth. These comics had artistic aspirations, and graphic novels became increasingly prominent, with Brown's autobiographical The Playboy and I Never Liked You, and Seth's faux-autobiographical It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken garnering considerable attention. Todd McFarlane from Calgary had been making waves since the late 1980s illustrating comics for DC and Marvel Comics, becoming a fan favourite writer/artist for Spider-Man. He eventually left to co-found the creator-owned comics publishing collective Image Comics, where he debuted the enormously successful Spawn. Spawn holds the record for most copies sold of an independent comic, and was the most financially successful comics franchise of the decade. =21st century= Chester Brown's best-selling Louis Riel was the first work in comics to receive a Canada Council grant. At the dawn of the 21st Century, the comics industry had changed considerably. The graphic novel had come into its own, and traditional comics sales dropped significantly. Louis Riel, who had been a major target of John Bengough's caricatures in the early days of Confederation, was the protagonist in Chester Brown's award-winning, best-selling \\"comic-strip biography\\". With his graphic novels and book collections, he gained a wider audience than he had with his serial comic books, and he abandoned serial comics entirely to focus on original graphic novels after Louis Riel. Greater appreciation of the artform was shown when Brown and Seth became recipients of grants from the Canada Council for the Arts. Dave Sim's Cerebus completed its planned 26-year, 300-issue run in 2004. Foreign comics, especially Japanese, became quite successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining large numbers of female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child pornography and result in jail terms. Drawn and Quarterly has become known as a house for art comics, translations of non-English works, like Montrealer Michel Rabagliati's Paul series, and archive editions of classic comics, such as Wright's Little Nipper. The publisher has earned a reputation for the special attention they put into book design, and has played a pivotal rôle in shaping comics' rise in artistic prominence, and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US. D&Q; publisher Chris Oliveros, along with Art Spiegelman, lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels, which would be subdivided by subject. Webcomics, such as Kate Beaton's Hark! A Vagrant, Ryan Sohmer and Lar deSouza's Looking for Group, and Karl Kerschl's The Abominable Charles Christopher, became an increasingly popular outlet for Canadian cartoonists. The popularity of Beaton's work has led to it being published in book form, with Time magazine placing it in the top 10 fiction books of 2011. The comics community in Canada has grown, and has grown appreciative of its talent, celebrating it with awards such as the Doug Wrights and Joe Shusters, as well as with classy events such as the international Toronto Comic Arts Festival, which has been cosponsored by the Toronto Public Library since 2009. French Canada The comics of Québec, also known as \\"BDQ\\" (bande dessinée québécoise), have followed a different path than those of English Canada. While newspapers tend to populate their funny pages with syndicated American comic strips, in general comics there have followed Franco-Belgian comics, with The Adventures of Tintin and Asterix being particularly popular and influential. Comics also tend to be printed in the comic album format that is popular in Europe. Aside from humorous parodies, there is no superhero tradition in Québec comics. =Early history (1790s–1960s)= \\"Pour un dîner de Noël\\" (Raoul Barré, 1902), the first comic strip to appear in a daily Québec newspaper. Barré demonstrates an interest in movement, which he would develop later as a pioneer in animation Québec comics have alternately flourished and languished, seeing several brief periods of intense activity followed by long periods of inundation with foreign content. Comics first appeared in the humour pages of newspapers in the 19th century, following the trends coming from Europe. In the late 19th Century, Henri Julien published two books of political caricatures, L'album drolatique du journal Le Farceur, after which the number of cartoonists began to increase in newspapers in Québec City and Montreal. 1904 saw, in the newspaper La Patrie, the publication of Les Aventures de Timothée (The Adventures of Timothée) by Albéric Bourgeois. This is said to be the first French-language comic to feature speech balloons. Joseph Charlebois's comic-strip adaptation of Le Père Ladébauche (Father Debauchery) also debuted in 1904, in La Presse, a popular strip that would last until 1957. Raoul Barré had the first comic strip to appear in a Québec daily newspaper in 1902, called \\"Pour un dîner de Noël\\" (\\"For a Christmas Dinner\\"). In 1912, he created a strip called Noahzark Hotel for the New York-based McClure Syndicate, which he brought to La Patrie in French the next year. Soon after he moved into animation, becoming an innovative pioneer in the field. Québécois cartoonists would propose a number of strips to compete with the American strips that dominated the Sundays and dailies. The native Québec presence on those pages would become more dominant after 1940, however, with the introduction of the War Exchange Conservation Act, which restricted the import of foreign strips. Albert Chartier created the comical character Onésime in 1943, a strip that would have the longest run of any in Québec. After World War II, during the Great Darkness, comics publication became dominated with religious comics, most of which were imported from the US. Native Québec comics did flourish for a brief period between 1955 and 1960, however, but were soon replaced again with American content, while also facing competition from the new Franco-Belgian publications, which appeared in full-colour, and by the mid-1960s had put the local Catholic publications out of business. =Springtime of BDQ (1970s–present)= The revolutionary 1960s and the Quiet Revolution in Québéc saw a new vigour in BDQ. What Georges Raby called the Spring of Québécois comics (printemps de la BD québécoise) is said to have begun in 1968 with the creation of the group Chiendent, who published in La Presse and Dimanche- Magazine. Jacques Hurtubise (Zyx), Réal Godbout, Gilles Thibault, and Jacques Boivin were particularly notable cartoonists, and numerous short-lived publications with strange names appeared, like Ma®de in Québec and L'Hydrocéphale illustré. The comics no longer focused on younger audiences, instead seeking confrontation or experimenting with graphics, drawing influence from French comics for mature audiences like those published in Pilote magazine, as well as translations of American undergrounds, translations of which were published in the journal Mainmise. During the 1970s, BDQ were sometimes called \\"BDK\\", bande dessinée kébécoise. Croc was a popular outlet for Québec cartoonists in the 1980s In 1979, Jacques Hurtubise, Pierre Huet and Hélène Fleury would establish the long-lived, satirical Croc, which published many leading talents of the era, many of whom were able to launch their careers through the magazine's help. Croc begat another magazine, Titanic, dedicated to comic strips, and in 1987, Safarir, a Mad-like publication patterned after the French Hara-Kiri, rose in competition with Croc. By the mid-1980s, a number of professional comics publishers began to flourish. In Montreal in the 1980s and 1990s, in parallel to mainstream humour magazines, a healthy underground scene developed, and self-published fanzines proliferated. Julie Doucet, Henriette Valium, Luc Giard, Éric Thériault, Gavin McInnes and Siris were among the names that were discovered in the small press publications. Michel Rabagliati's semi-autobiographical comics have had international success, in French and in translation In the 21st Century, Michel Rabagliati and his semi-autobiographical Paul series has seen Tintin- like sales levels in Québec, and his books have been published in English by Drawn and Quarterly. Around the turn of the century, the government of Québec mandated La Fondation du 9e art (\\"The 9th Art Foundation\\") to promote francophone cartoonists in North America. There have also emerged events such as the Festival de la bande dessinée francophone de Québec in Québec City and la Zone internationale du neuvième art (ZINA). Publication, promotion and distribution As in the US, large Canadian newspapers typically have a page of comic strips in their daily editions and a full-colour Sunday comics section on Saturdays or Sundays. Editorial cartoonists are also common; the Association of Canadian Editorial Cartoonists is a professional association founded in 1988 to promote their interests. There are a number of English- and French-language publishers active in Canadian comics. Drawn and Quarterly is a Montreal-based English-language publisher of arts comics, translations, and classic comic reprints. Founded by Chris Oliveros in 1990, Drawn and Quarterly is one of the most influential publishers in alternative comics. Arcana Studio of British Columbia publishes a large number of titles, and Koyama Press joined the fray in 2007. In French, Les 400 coups, Mécanique Générale, La Pastèque and the Québec arm of Glénat are amongst the active publishers. The small press has played an important rôle; self-publishing is a common means of putting out comics, largely influenced by the success of Dave Sim's Cerebus. Minicomics another form that has remained popular since the 1980s, when Chester Brown and Julie Doucet got started by distributing self-published photocopied comics. The minicomics scene has been spurred on by Broken Pencil, a magazine dedicated to promoting the zines. A number of fan conventions are held throughout Canada, including the Central Canada Comic Con, Fan Expo Canada, Montreal Comiccon, Paradise Comics Toronto Comicon, Ottawa Comiccon, and Toronto Comicon. The Toronto Comic Arts Festival (TCAF), modeled after European festivals such as Angoulême and the American Small Press Expo, has grown since 2003, and since 2009 has enjoyed the support of the Toronto Public Library. Awards A number of awards for Canadian comics and cartooning have appeared, especially since the beginning of the 21st Century. The National Newspaper Awards was established in 1949 with a category for Editorial Cartooning honouring those that \\"embody an idea made clearly apparent, good drawing, and striking pictorial effect in the public interest\\". The award's first recipient was Jack Booth of The Globe and Mail. The Bédélys Prize () has been awarded to French-language comics since 2000. It comes with bursaries for the Prix Bédélys Québec (for Best Book from Québec) and Prix Bédélys Fanzine. Since 2005 the Joe Shuster Awards have been handed out by the Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association, named after the Toronto-born co-creator of Superman. It is open to all Canadians, including those living abroad, as well as permanent residents, for comics in any language. Along with awards for Outstanding Cartoonist, Outstanding Writer, Outstanding Artist and others, it also features the Joe Shuster Hall of Fame, and the Harry Kremer Retailer Award, named after the founder of Canada's oldest surviving comic shop. The Doug Wright Awards also began in 2005. Awards are given for Best Book, Best Emerging Talent, and since 2008 the Pigskin Peters Award for non- narrative (or nominally-narrative) comics; Pigskin Peters was a character in Jimmy Frise's Birdseye Center. The Doug Wright Awards also inducts cartoonists into Giants of the North: The Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame. Academia From the 1990s onward an increasing amount of literature on Canadian comics has appeared, in both official languages. Books such as Guardians of the North (1992) and Invaders from the North (2006) appeared by comics historian John Bell, who became senior archivist at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa. American magazine Alter Ego ran a special issue on Canadian comics in 2004. In French, Michel Viau wrote a book on francophone comics called BDQ: Répertoire des publications de bandes dessinées au Québec des origines à nos jours (2000). Bart Beaty and Jeet Heer have been writing about comics academically and professionally, and regularly have articles educating the public on comics published in newspapers such as the National Post and the Boston Globe, as well as comics and literary magazines. Canadian feminist scholars such as Mary Louise Adams, Mona Gleason, and Janice Dickin McGinnis have done research into the anti-crime comics campaigns of the late 1940s and 1950s, from the point of view of the moral panic and social and legal history of the era, and the sociology of sexuality.

He was elected by parliament as President in January 2012, following the 2011 general election. Personal life Loeak was born on the Ailinglaplap Atoll on 11 November 1952. He attended Marshall Islands High School before traveling to the United States to study at the Hawaii Pacific College and Gonzaga University School of Law. Loeak is a native speaker of Marshallese and also speaks English. He is married to Anono Lieom Loeak and has three children and eight grandchildren. Political career Loeak was first elected to the Nitijela in 1985 when he represented the Ailinglaplap Atoll. He served in the cabinet of President Amata Kabua as Minister of Justice from 1988 to 1992. He became Minister of Social Services in 1992 and held that post until 1996 when Kunio Lemari became acting president on the death of Kabua and Loeak became Minister of Education. He held the education portfolio for two years, continuing his cabinet work under President Imata Kabua who was sworn in during 1997. Kabua made him Minister for the Ralik Chain of islands in 1998, holding that position for a year and also undertaking an additional portfolio as Minister-in-Assistance to the President in 1999. During his time in the Nitijela Loeak took an active part in many of its committees including those for the Judiciary and Government Relations; Public Account, Health and Education and Social Services (which he chaired); Foreign Affairs and Trade; Appropriation; Resource and Development; International Protection, Peace, Security and Protection of the Environment. He was also a member of the Second and Third Constitutional Conventions, serving as vice-president of the latter, and chaired the Bill of Rights Committee. Loeak was part of the team that negotiated the extension of the United States lease of the Marshallese part of the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site after an eight-year deadlock on talks. The Marshall Islands government agreed to accept payment of $32 million in return for extending the lease on the site. Loeak was re- elected to the Nitijela in 2007 and has held the seat of Ailinglaplap since then. He re-entered the cabinet in 2008 as Minister-in-Assistance to President Litokwa Tomeing. President R.O.C. (Taiwan) President Ma Ying-jeou at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Loeak became president of the Marshall Islands in January 2012 when the Nitijela elected him to that post. Loeak was elected as presidential candidate by default when former President Kessai Note refused to elect Aelon Kein Ad chosen nominee Tony Debrum who had won the primary. Loeak was thus chosen as second choice to keep the majority. Loeak defeated incumbent president Jurelang Zedkaia by 21 votes to 11.

In November 2006, he filed a lawsuit against the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u., stating that the title of their second studio album Lyudi Invalidy was insulting to handicapped people. Speeches In November 2006, Vokuyev addressed the issue with various disability organizations. According to them, a text from the booklet of t.A.T.u.'s album Lyudi Invalidy contained derogatory remarks against handicapped people: > Люди инвалиды не знают, что значит быть человеком. Они – подделка на основе > человекообразной болванки. Они не живут, а функционируют.

Vokuyev filed a complaint with the Public Prosecutor of Moscow, Yuri Syomin, which states that the inscription offends the honour and dignity of persons with disabilities. The appeal requests that \\"administrative measures\\" be taken. Vokuyev believes that the text annotation to the album is contrary to Article 21 of the Constitution, which stipulates that \\"nobody is to harm the dignity of any citizen\\" [paraphrased].

It travels from the northwestern corner of Columbus northeast to just before Shiloh, north to Greenville, and northwest to Carrollton. Route description The alternate route starts at an intersection with the US 27 mainline in Columbus in Muscogee County, and initially runs northeast into Harris County, concurrent with Georgia State Route 85 (SR 85). Within Ellerslie, the route has a short concurrency with SR 315. The route splits from SR 85 south of Shiloh, on the Harris–Talbot county line, while moving onto SR 85A and briefly SR 116 before it cuts across the northwestern corner of Talbot County. It then enters Meriwether County, running along the southeastern edge of FDR State Park while briefly crossing SR 190, and curving from the northwest to the northeast. Heading briefly northwest again through FDR State Park this time and then north into Warm Springs, now co-signed with SR 41, the route turns north and heads into a traffic circle with SR 18 which joins US 27A through Greenville which leaves the concurrency at SR 109. Later it runs through Luthersville where it intersects SR 54 before heading into Coweta County. In Moreland US 27 Alternate is joined by a concurrency with U.S. Route 29, which also serves as the northern terminus of Georgia State Route 41. However, like its parent route, it joins the alternate in another concurrency. US ALT 27/29/SR 14 serves as the main road through downtown Moreland, and after passing by the Lewis Grizzard Museum, the Atlanta and West Point Railroad main line moves to the west side of the road at a power line right-of-way. It curves away from the tracks again at the intersection of \\"Old Highway 29,\\" and after winding around the northwestern edge of Newnan-Coweta County Airport, Interstate 85 (I-85) is encountered at a diamond interchange (Exit 41). Just north of that interchange it encounters the southern terminus of a concurrency with Georgia State Route 16. Together, US ALT 27/29/SRs 14/16 run through marshland around Pearl Springs Lake and East Newnan Lake as it enter Newnan. The routes cross over that A&WP; Railroad Line between Newnan South Industrial Road and Corinth Road. From there it runs through the Greenville Street-LaGrange Street Historic District (signed as the Greenville- LaGrange Historic District), before passing the Coweta County Superior Courthouse and running over a bridge above a former Central of Georgia Railway line. Greenville Street ends at Salbide Avenue and US ALT 27/29/SRs 14/16 becomes a one-way pair along Jefferson Street and LaGrange Street, both of which are part of the Newnan Commercial Historic District. It also runs along both sides of the historic Coweta County Courthouse between Broad and Washington Streets. At Posey Street, the routes are joined by another concurrency with Georgia State Route 34. The routes turn left onto Clark Street as they join another concurrency with westbound Georgia State Route 34, only for US 29/SR 14 to leave the US ALT 27/SRs 16/34 concurrency one block later at Jackson Street. As US 27 Alternate/SR 16/SR 34 moves from Clark Street to Temple Avenue, they begin to head northwest out of Newnan, only for SR 34 to leave that concurrency at Franklin Road. Crossing a bridge over the Chattahoochee River, and thus the Coweta-Carroll County line, the routes run through Whiteburg where they intersect SR 5 before briefly turning west- northwest between the communities of Banning and Clem, then turns back to the northwest. At the intersection with SR 166 in Carrollton, US 27 ALT/SR 16 makes a left turn with westbound SR 166 joining that concurrency until finally reaching its northern terminus, at a diamond interchange with US 27/SR 1\\\\. SR 166 continues west towards Ranburne, Alabama, while SR 16 continues north along US 27 through downtown Carrollton until breaking away and running to the northwest toward GA 100 south of I-20 near Tallapoosa and Waco. The following portins of US 27 Alt. are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: *The entire Muscogee County portion *From the I-85 interchange (on US 29/SR 14), just south of East Newnan, to just north of the southern end of the SR 34 concurrency (on US 29/SR 14/SR 16) in Newnan *From an indeterminate point southeast of Carrollton to its northern terminus in the city.

At the time of his death, Bidve, was studying for a Master of Science degree in \\"Microelectronics and System-on-Chip Engineering\\" at Lancaster University. Investigation The murder was brought to prominence in the UK and abroad due to the execution style killing and after the failure of the police to inform his family in India who subsequently learned of the death of their 23-year-old son through Facebook. The family complained about this, and about delays in processing the case and returning the body to them. As a result, the police sent two senior officers to Pune in India to apologise and give them details of the progress of the investigation. In particular, Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley said: \\"We felt it was important to make personal contact with the family. We need to explain to them in person where we are up to in the investigation.\\" The family said that they had \\"complete trust and confidence in Greater Manchester Police\\". , five people had been arrested in total. However, three of the group were bailed until March 2012 pending further inquiries. A fourth man, aged 19, who was originally bailed later had his \\"bail cancelled\\", police said, according to the BBC report. Previously, on 2 January, the prime suspect had famously announced himself as Kiaran \\"Psycho\\" Stapleton during his brief appearance at Manchester City Magistrates' Court. Prosecutor Ben Southam then informed the court the case had to be sent to Manchester Crown Court as Stapleton was charged with murder. Stapleton, of Salford, was remanded in custody. There was no application for bail. On 26 July 2012, Kiaran Stapleton was convicted of the murder of Anuj Bidve.Kiaran Stapleton was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum of 30 years before parole is considered, on 27 July 2042. The prosecution and defence at the trial agree that Stapleton has antisocial personality disorder. Controversies These are mostly centred on the trauma suffered by Bidve's father Subhash when he learned about his son's death via a social networking site, before the police had been able to make contact. He stated that, \\"the world was finished for us\\", while laying flowers with his wife Yogini, and brother-in-law Rakesh Sonawane, at the murder scene. There is still much uncertainty over the motivation for the attack and how it should be treated in law. As of 5 January, the police had not established whether it was a hate crime or part of a gang initiation. Soon after, the British coroner decided to release the body to the Indian consulate so that arrangements could be made to return it to Pune for the ceremony to take place there. Circumstances of death and later family visit Bidve was shot on Ordsall Lane at 01:30 GMT. He died later in hospital. According to some news reports, more than 400 people paid tribute at a memorial service for him on the night of 2 January at the scene of the shooting in Salford. The spot is less than a mile from the skyscrapers of Manchester city centre and its landmark Beetham Tower. The Bidve family were accompanied on their visit by dignitaries from the consulate general of India in Birmingham. They were greeted by Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson of Greater Manchester Police, who had previously travelled to India to meet the family, as well as Dawn Copley and Barbara Spicer, the chief executive of Salford City Council. On 5 January, the family met Keith Vaz, chairman of the Parliamentary Home Affairs Select Committee, at Westminster. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who was on a visit to the North West at that time, spoke to the family on the phone, having earlier committed himself to meet the parents if they so wished. The Vice-Chancellor of Lancaster University Professor Mark E. Smith said the university had provided financial assistance to the family and would hold a memorial ceremony for Anuj later in January.

Bakevelliidae species are found in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Living a stationary life attached to substrate in marine and brackish environments, they formed shells of an aragonite composition with a low amount of magnesium calcite. The family Cassianellidae was named by K. Ichikawa in 1958. Description The cassianellids are noted for being restricted to the Triassic only, going extinct during the end Triassic extinction event. They are thought to have a close relationship to the longer lived family Bakevelliidae and it is possible the cassianellids may have even evolved from one of the early Triassic bakevelliid genera. As is found in the Bakevelliidae genus Kobayashites and the Isognomonidae genus Lithiotis, cassianellids are distinguished by the presence of a larval septum which is retained in the adult shell morphology. Also notable for the entire family is the presence of a primitive alivincular type ligament, termed an alivincular-areate ligament. This form of ligament was widely found in many of the Triassic bivalve families but evolution of more refined ligament systems resulted in the shift away from the alivincular- areate system. Only a few modern families, such as Gryphaeidae, still retain the alivincular-areate ligament system. Several of the genera, such as Cassianella, have a widespread distribution.

Born in Piva, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire, he was an oxen trader who allegedly left his village after experiencing Ottoman injustice. Mentioned in 1654 as a brigand during the Venetian–Ottoman war, he entered the service of the Republic of Venice in 1656. The hajduks were used to protect Venetian Dalmatia. He remained a low-rank hajduk for the following decade, participating in some notable operations such as the raid on Trebinje. Between 1665 and 1668 he quickly rose through the ranks to the level of harambaša (\\"bandit leader\\"). After the war, which ended unfavourably for the Venetians, the hajduks were moved out of their haven in the Bay of Kotor under Ottoman pressure. Between 1671 and 1684 Pivljanin, along with other hajduks and their families, were refugees in Dalmatia. Upon renewed conflict, he was returned to the Bay of Kotor and placed in charge of defending the frontier; in 1685 he and his band fell in battle against the advancing Ottoman governor of Scutari. Regarded as one of the most distinguished hajduks of his time, he is praised in Serbian epic poetry.  Early life  Dragojlo Nikolić, nicknamed Bajo Pivljanin, was born around 1630 in Piva (modern-day northwestern Montenegro), at that time part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Herzegovina. According to oral tradition he was born in the village of Rudinice (in Plužine), while there are two versions as to which family he belonged. According to one tradition, found in Kosta Radović's novel Vrtijeljka (1922), he was born in the village of Rudinice (now in Plužine) in Piva to his father Nikola and his mother Ruža, of the Ruđić brotherhood. Radović claims that he was born on 22 May 1622, while it is estimated that he was born in 1630. His godfather, the monk Ivanović, named him Dragojlo, while the nickname Bajo (derived from baja, \\"snake\\", a common nickname in Piva which was thought to protect children from evil) was given to him by his grandfather Simo. This version was also mentioned by Blagojević, who stated that Bajo Pivljanin belonged to the Nikolić family in Gornje Rudinice, descending from the old brotherhood of Ruđić. The Ruđić brotherhood from Rudinice, which later dispersed elsewhere, is one of two family trees in Piva from which many Pivan families descend. According to the priest Toma Lješević (1897), Bajo was the son of Jovan Ivanović and a mother of the Tadić brotherhood; belonging to the Ivanović brotherhood in Donje Rudinice, in a place named after them. This family, as many other families in Piva, either left or was absorbed by other families. In the Ivanovići hamlet of Donje Rudinice, there was a kula (tower house) belonging to Pivljanin; this tower house, and the village church, were later destroyed by the Ottomans after his operations became well known. Pivljanin was an oxen trader, a common occupation in the 17th and 18th centuries, and often exported through Risan market, becoming quite wealthy. According to the epic poem Sa šta Pivljanin Bajo ode u uskoke collected by Vuk Karadžić, written in the form of a confessional monologue of Pivljanin, he left Piva and became a hajduk (bandit) after he murdered Asan-aga Kopčić, an Ottoman leader in Drobnjaci who had assaulted him. With Limo \\"Limun\\" Srdanović from Drobnjaci, another trader whom he met at the start of the Cretan war, he led a band of 30 hajduks. Piva Monastery, which Bajo protected from the Ottoman ravagers. Legend has it that even today the mark of the bullet can be seen, which Bajo fired as a warning above the head of one of the pillagers who was standing in the doorway Folk tradition has it that Bajo first left Piva for Drobnjaci, and eventually Drobnjaci for Morača. Bajo was originally engaged to Milica, daughter of a local knez Bogdan Papović from Kazanci. Bogdan was, however, pressured by the recently appointed Pasha of Gacko to hand his daughter to him. Pasha, originally Tepavčević, was taken through devshirme, islamized, educated and served in Constantinople and Travnik. They arranged for a meeting on which Milica was supposed to break the engagement, and choose Pasha instead of Bajo. Bajo, who prepared himself for the wedding, came to the meeting, and after questioning the girl about her choice, asked for his ring back. Milica handed it to him, at which moment Bajo killed her as well as Pasha and two of his bodyguards. Knez Bogdan took shelter in his house, which Bajo burned, together with a mosque Pasha erected not long ago, killing with his kinsmen and grooms all the Ottomans who served the Pasha in the process. This action forced him to abandon his tribe, losing all his wealth, and relocate to Drobnjaci, where he planned to lay low for a certain amount of time. There, he presented himself as Spasoje Sokolović, and found a job as an employee of Knez Tomić. Since it was the mowing part of the year, Hasan-Aga Kopčić ordered all of the local knez's to send him their workforces to Bukovica. Bajo was among these people, and he broke his mowing blade one day while working. Taking a break to fix it, he enraged the Agha, who started hitting him with a whip. Bajo then decapitated him with his fixed blade, took his horse and weapons and ran to Morača, which at the time was hajduk's nest and the most defiant of all the Montenegrin Highland tribes towards the Ottomans. Bajo lived in Morača for several years, his exploits from this period (like the killing of Hafiz-bey, saving his sister Jela from Muslim marauders and protecting his cousin Sekula from wealthy and vain Pejović family) are preserved in collective memory of the population of North Montenegro. Morača was razed by the Ottomans sometime in the late 1640s, after which Bajo took shelter in Venetian controlled territories.  Cretan War  Bajo Pivljanin kills a Turk (1878), by Serbian painter Aksentije Marodić (1838–1909) The hajduks, who were Ottoman subjects, were recruited by the Republic of Venice as guerilla forces to co-operate in the defence of the Venetian–Ottoman frontier in Dalmatia during the Cretan War (1645–69). They crossed into Venetian territory from which they conducted raids into Ottoman-controlled lands. Pivljanin was first mentioned in 1654 as one of 1,500 hajduks operating from Venetian territory. During the Cretan War he mostly fought in the southern parts of Dalmatia and Herzegovina, where the population was predominantly anti-Ottoman. Pivljanin was a close friend and favourite of Serbian Orthodox metropolitan (bishop) Vasilije (Basil) Jovanović during the war. He is believed to have begun organizing his own band in ; according to an epic poem, Pivljanin, Cvjetko Vlastelinović and Đurko Kapetanović established a band which operated in Herzegovina. The hajduk bands carried out one of their most successful operations in Herzegovina in March 1655, raiding Trebinje, taking many slaves and carrying away considerable loot. This raid was commanded by Terzić from Nikšić, and left Herzegovina through Cavtat (part of the Republic of Ragusa). The raids led to conflict between Ragusa and the Beys of Novi led by Omer-beg Begzadić, whose villages had suffered the most. In February 1656 the hajduk bands broke through Rijeka Dubrovačka into Herzegovina and returned with more loot. In the same year, Pivljanin began to work for the Venetians. After their defeat at Morača in 1649, and the building of the Kolašin fortress (1647–51) by the Ottomans, the Venetians brought offensive operations to a halt. From 1655 to 1657, the Ottomans made several attacks on the Venetian territory around Grbalj. The main hajduk centre became Perast in the Bay of Kotor, which they used as base to raid Ottoman territory. By 1658, the hajduks had mastered Herzegovina to the extent that they \\"forced taxes on all villages towards Gacko\\". Taxes were collected by groups of 10–12 hajduks, while disobedience was punished. Pivljanin and his hajduks also operated in Popovo and Romanija. Refugees from Ottoman Herzegovina were gladly accepted into the Republic of Venice. According to the historian Ljubo Mihić, the most distinguished of the hajduks in this period were Pivljanin and Stevo Popović. View of the Bay of Kotor from Perast Pivljanin rose quickly in the hajduk ranks; in 1664 and 1665 he was mentioned simply as \\"Bajo hajduk\\" in Ragusan documents, but by 1666 he was referred to as a \\"buljubaša\\" (captain), and by 1668 as a \\"viši (higher) harambaša\\" (bandit leader). Pivljanin's tactics included quick raids and destroying bridges as he retreated. For example, the stone bridge on the Tara in Šiplje was destroyed after his band had raided Kolašin. In 1664, Pivljanin is mentioned as a hajduk commander active in the Republic of Ragusa. At the beginning of August 1664, hajduk leaders Stevo and Nikola Popović, Vukosav Puhalović, Pivljanin, Dijete, Čauš, and others, destroyed a merchant caravan on the border with Ragusa, and took 150 cargoes of very expensive goods; Armenian merchants, to whom the goods belonged, complained to the Doge of Venice. The Venetian government warned the hajduks against further provocations of the Ottomans, fearing new attacks from Sohrab Mehmed Pasha, the sanjak-bey of Herzegovina. In ca. 1665, Pivljanin suffered a great defeat by the Ottomans at the village of Grdijevići, losing most of his band and being forced to leave his home region. One hundred and fifty years later, rebels on the Tara used this event, among others, as justification for a revolt. At the beginning of May 1666, Pivljanin raided a Ragusan ship off the coast of Koločep that was bound for Venice with merchandise, unloading eight wagons of wax and freeing captured merchants, among whom were four Turks, in return for a high payment and a written statement that the wax and money had been given to him voluntarily. The Ragusans claimed that at the time of the raid, Pivljanin had shouted that the provveditore (district governor) of Venetian Dalmatia had given him the order to take all that he came across, both on the sea and the land. Five days later, Pivljanin raided a large and unusually rich caravan carrying Venetian merchandise through Ottoman territory. In September 1666, Pivljanin and Mato Njegošević attacked an Ottoman caravan in Mosko then retreated to Banjani. On 25 March 1669, Pivljanin, living in Stoliv (near Kotor), was recorded in Kotor as having acknowledged a debt of 62.5 real (40 groschen being 1 real) to Gierolamo Cazalieri. In early April 1669 Pivljanin and Puhalović raised and looted in Herzegovina, and retreated towards Šipan. According to legend, he burnt down a mosque in Nevesinje, and another one in Počitelj. There are accounts recorded by the anthropologist Jevto Dedijer that several Muslim families left their homes after cruel treatment by Pivljanin; the Šehović left Korjenići and moved to south Herzegovina after he and Limun burnt down their house; the Kajtaz and Rorić left Nevesinje and moved to Mostar, and a large number of the families of Slivlja left their homes. The war ended with Ottoman victory in 1669, with Venice being forced to relinquish all of the territory taken over by the uskoks and hajduks during the war, with only Klis becoming a new Venetian possession. The Venetian–Ottoman border delineation act was signed on 30 October 1671.  Inter-war period  After the war, the southeastern Venetian possessions (the Bay of Kotor) were destituted. War, hunger and frequent epidemics had decreased the population. As soon as the peace had been signed, the uskoks and hajduks became a nuisance to Venice; up until then frontiersmen defending Dalmatia and the Bay of Kotor from Ottoman invasion, they were now a potential cause to new conflicts with the Ottomans, which Venice wanted to avoid. The hajduks were accustomed to living on war booty, thus they had a hard time coping with peacetime. The provveditore generale Antonio Priuli, who was very favourable towards the frontiersmen, called uskok and hajduk leaders to Zadar to discuss ways to \\"create conditions for a normal life\\". In December 1669 Antonio Priuli brought from Perast to Venice hajduk leaders including Bajo Pivljanin, Grujica Žeravica, Vukosav Puhalović and buljubaša Milošević. Earlier, in June, the Venetian provveditore issued the termination of duty of the \\"chiefs that protect the Kotor area\\", the first three mentioned, and had them included in the list of soldiers having the right of pay and bread. Pivljanin's bravery and sacrifice to the Republic of Venice is especially outlined. The four leaders asked the Doge if the hajduks could be granted Vrana in Ravni Kotari or Risan in the Bay of Kotor as a district for them to settle, and benefits already given to Paštrovići, Grbalj and Perast, due, among other issues, to the fact that \\"the number of hajduks that fled to the Perast area in 1654 had risen to 1,500, of whom 500 were militarily able, and now, in peacetime, their livelihood was under threat\\". The issue was finally settled after several months with the arrival of Antonio Barbaro as the new generale provveditore. In 1670, Barbaro decided that the hajduks would be permitted to settle in Risan and a number of neighbouring villages. Soon after the decision was made, the hajduks and frontier Ottomans came into conflict, resulting in many Ottoman casualties. The Ottoman government then demanded that the Venetian official (bailo) in Constantinople remove the hajduks from Risan. The Venetian government decided to move the hajduks of the Bay of Kotor to Istria on the northern Adriatic coast. Colonisation began in May 1671, with the Venetian captain in charge of Istria being informed of the pending arrival of 1,300 hajduks. By the beginning of June 1671, all hajduks from Risan had been transported by sea to Istria. Istria had been depopulated by epidemics and the Uskok War (1615–18); and it therefore made sense to relocate the hajduks to eliminate the frontier clashes between the hajduks and Ottomans, which were disturbing the peace between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians also wanted to repopulate Istria, so the Venetian Senate made the decision to resettle the hajduks there. Barbaro guaranteed the hajduks tax exemptions and appropriations, the appointment of four judges to mediate their disputes, and the allocation of livestock and agricultural tools. Apart from Puljština in southern Istria, the hajduks requested grants of land on the Buzet karst. Friction between the hajduks and Venetians was evident in the negotiations between the hajduk leaders and captain Lunardo Mercella; as a significant part of the promised benefits were not forthcoming, four hajduk representativesNikola Popović, buljubaša Milošević, Pivljanin and Petar Babićappealed directly to the Doge of Venice to confirm Barbaro's chapters. Barbaro calmed the hajduks down by regulating their status. The Venetian government initially sought to disperse the hajduks across the Venetian–Ottoman frontier in order to prevent conflict with other Venetian subjects, but they were temporarily settled at Pula in Istria. In the summer of 1671 a malaria epidemic broke out, leading to additional complications. The epidemic was devastating to numerous hajduk families, the natives being more resistant to malaria; thus, part of the settlers moved to Ližnjan and Premantura, while others left to return to Dalmatia. Pivljanin and Njegošević lived in Premantura. In 1673, Pivljanin and his followers included 34 households, 18 of which lived in towns; 8 in Premantura (Promontore), 8 in Mutvoran (Momorano) and one in Peroj (Peroi); his followers consisted of a total of 157 individuals, 89 adults and 68 minors, 75 males and 82 females. Financial aid and incentives did not deliver the expected results for the hajduks, as they did not wish to settle in the assigned lands. Conflicts ensued between the hajduks and local people in Puljština, with kidnappings, hajduk attacks on fishermen and boats, and also revenge killings. The hajduks were enraged, and could not cope with the Istrian climate. Many of them moved to Senj, where the Uskoks were still active. During this time, Pivljanin and Njegošević were the most active in moving hajduks into the Habsburg Monarchy, and they travelled to Karlovac to negotiate. Some hajduks independently returned to the Bay of Kotor, where the provveditore of Kotor put some on galleys, imprisoned some at Klis, and exiled some, after killing others using old convictions as a pretext. When harambaša Njegošević was persecuted, the hajduks again sent Pivljanin to Venice as their envoy. In his plea to the Doge of Venice, dated 27March 1673, Pivljanin asked that the persecution of hajduks cease, stating that they had all been pardoned by an amnesty issued by Barbaro. The request was partly met, and some hajduks were freed. Pivljanin, Jovo Sikimić, and Njegošević settled Zadar in 1674, where they \\"came into contact with Serb leaders of the [Ravni] kotari uskoks (rebels)\\", but many hajduks remained in Istria. During 1675 the issues in Istria decreased, and by the next year, as more hajduks left the area, there are no further records regarding hajduks in Istria. While in Zadar, Pivljanin befriended Stojan Janković, a veteran hajduk from Ravni Kotari, who had been active in Dalmatia during the Cretan War. On 17January 1675, Pivljanin's brother Dimitrije married Ana (Anna Giacovichi, also called Anka and Janja), Stojan Janković's sister. In a letter to the Venetian government dated 3December 1675, Pivljanin offered to receive and hold the goods of Omer Mustafa Čehajić, which were part of a dispute with Vučić Kajić, and suggested Stojan Janković as a guarantor.; On 5February 1676, the birth of Pivljanin's son Simeon by his wife Manda was registered in the Orthodox parish.; According to the historian M.Jačov, Pivljanin's wife was another sister of Stojan Janković. The godmother of Pivljanin's son Simeon was Mato Njegošević's wife Ana.; Dimitrije's baby son Nikola was baptized on 1October 1677. On 3 May 1680, provveditore G. Cornaro prohibited some Venetian subjects to cause damage to the meadow in Suhovare rented by Pivljanin from Turks. On 9 January 1680, Dimitrije's wife Ana fell and broke her neck, being 25 years old at the time of death. After the Ottoman failure at the Battle of Vienna (11–12 September 1683), the people of Ravni Kotari and Kninska Krajina assembled under the leadership of Stojan's brother Ilija Janković and attacked the Ottomans. Pivljanin and his brother joined the band. The Venetians, in order to avoid a war, recalled Stojan Janković to Venice in October, calming Ilija, who is described as very restless and unmanageable. Dalmatian provveditore Lorenzo Dona sent colonel Ivan Radoš to the hajduks to calm them down and return them home. Radoš informed Dona on 10 November 1683 that he had met with Pivljanin, Vid Kalinić and Andrija Gilim at Kula Atlagića, who asked him to forward their request of forgiveness to the provveditore, then summoned Ilija Janković and Jovan Baljak. They all promised to follow Dona's command and stop hostility against Ottomans. When the hajduks calmed down by which time much of northern Dalmatia was in their handsthe Venetians returned Stojan to Ravni Kotari in December. In a letter dated 8December 1683, provveditore Dona forgave Pivljanin for desertion, and ordered his return in the list of cavalry bands which he had been part of, and gave him back wages for the intervening time. Venice entered into an alliance with Austria and declared war on the Ottomans in the spring of 1684. When hostilities began, Pivljanin was again in active Venetian service, finally returning to the Bay of Kotor.; Morean War Return to service Between January and the end of April 1684, the Republic of Venice accepted 4,200 families as settlers on the Venetian–Ottoman frontier, including 20,000 warriors. The Venetians provided them with food and 1,800 rifles, and their leaders were given monthly pay. The families were settled in the territory of Zadar and Šibenik, and around Klis. Pivljanin and his brother Dimitrije served in the cavalry bands in Zadar until Antonio Zeno, the extraordinary provveditore of Kotor, requested that they be sent for service in the Bay of Kotor. This was approved by Lorenzo Donà, the provveditore of Dalmatia, on 12April 1684. In September 1684 Pivljanin was documented as having been with his band in Herceg Novi, and in October in the area of Livno. The Venetian Senate thanked Pivljanin and Jovan Sikimić for their victory at Jezero, and approved Zeno's decision to reward them medals and sequins, on 12October 1684. Marino Mikiel, a Venetian commissary, writing of the state of the Venetian cavalry in Dalmatia on 26January 1685, highlighted that Stojan Janković and Pivljanin received the wages of cavalry soldiers due to their merit and by grace of the state, without having to effectively serve as soldiers. In March 1685 Pivljanin informed the Venetian extraordinary provveditore about his band's operations in the territory of the Republic of Ragusa; his band numbered 130 fighters and had three harambašas: Miho Kolumbara; Miloš Lepirić; and Božo Lučić. In February, they had captured a caravan with wheat in Zupci, stolen some cattle and burnt down the village of Glavska, attacked Cavtat and returned to Trebinje.  Battle of Vrtijeljka  Süleyman, the Ottoman sanjak-bey of Scutari sent word to the Montenegrin people that, \\"due to their relations with Morlachs (Venetian irregular troops) and hajduks\\", he would exterminate them all. Historiography is divided as to whether the Montenegrins really betrayed the hajduks in the ensuing battle; some believe that in order to avoid retaliation, the Montenegrins promised the head of Pivljanin, then betrayed the hajduks on the battlefield. The Ottoman forces under Süleyman approached Cetinje, and the two forces met at the hill of Vrtijeljka on 7May 1685. The hajduk force consisted of fighters, including also Montenegrins, Mainjani and Primorci, commanded by over-intendant Bošković, harambaša Pivljanin, and the guvernadur of Grbalj. The large Ottoman force crossed the Morača and headed towards Cetinje. The hajduks carried a war flag with Venetian symbols. The hajduks were defeated by the Ottomans, and Pivljanin was killed in battle. Süleyman had Pivljanin's head sent to the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed IV, as a great war trophy. The importance of the battle is evident in the fact that the heads of Pivljanin and his hajduks decorated the entrance hall of the seraglio in Constantinople, and that Süleyman was elevated to pasha following the victory. The severed heads were taken to Constantinople as proof of finishing the task and that the enemy was triumphally defeated. Only heads of worthy, more prominent outlaws, of names and work that was well- known, had this treatment. Heads of hajduks were otherwise put on town palisades or on poles beside the road or crossroads. The fact that multiple other hajduk heads were sent to Constantinople along with Pivljanin's could primarily be explained as that the Ottomans wanted to visibly display the defeat of a notable movement, which had brought much grief to them. The news of the battle was recorded in Rome on 27May 1685, in this way: \\"two courageous leaders, one named Bajo, friend of captain Janko, and the other, captain Vuković the Arbanas, died\\"; the source states that the defeat was due to a betrayal by Montenegrins in the battle. Aftermath Drawing of the tombs where Bajo Pivljanin and his wife are allegedly buried in Cetinje (1881) Pivljanin's importance is evident in Antonio Zeno's evaluation: \\"since the death of harambaša Bajo, the frontier is left without leaders able to control the hajduks bands\\". It has been claimed that Pivljanin was buried by the Vlah Church in Cetinje. In 1685, Pivljanin's brother Dimitrije, on behalf of Pivljanin's widow and two sons, requested that Pivljanin's pay be transferred to one of the sons. The request highlighted that Pivljanin had left his home in Herzegovina to fight for the Republic of Venice, to whom he had great value as a fighter. It was decided on 20 September 1689 that his brother Dimitrije and two sons be admitted into the Venetian cavalry. Mentioning Pivljanin as having \\"proved himself worthy\\", dealt \\"damage to the Turks\\", and suffered \\"many received wounds\\", the decision was made to carry out an earlier plan that Pivljanin's sons be admitted into the cavalry. As Pivljanin had died, his brother Dimitrije, who had \\"given proofs of righteousness and loyalty on several occasions\\", and his two mature sons, Vuk and Sima (Simeun), were admitted into the band of Soliman in Herceg Novi, \\"thus, every one of them received wages of a soldier in the cavalry\\".  Legacy  There are many epic poems and stories about his life. Metropolitan Petar II Petrović-Njegoš included a eulogy to him in The Mountain Wreath (1847). Serbian Orthodox priest and historian Ilarion Ruvarac (1832–1905) called him a \\"glorious knight\\". The village of Bajovo Polje (\\"Bajo's field\\") was named after Bajo Pivljanin, it is said, after he killed his first Turk at the field. The poet Vukašin Gagović used the alias Bajo Pivljanin. A Yugoslav Partisan battalion was named after him. There are streets in cities and towns in former Yugoslavia named after him, as well as a Montenegrin futsal club, KMF Bajo Pivljanin. There are several brotherhoods and families that claim ancestry or kinship with him or his brothers. The Bajovići, having the slava (patron saint day) of St. Nicholas, with tens of houses in Bezuje, and one house in their original village of Rudinice (1971), have several versions of their origin: the first that they descend from a brother of Bajo Pivljanin; the second, from a villager called Čepur that took over Bajo Pivljanin's estate after the family left; the third, that the Bajovići who were really called Čepuri until 1887 descend from a branch of a family tree also including the Vračari and Taušani, closely related to the Gagovići, in line with their slava in common. Based on the presumed connection with Pivljanin, King Nikola I accepted member Đorđija Bajović into officer school. When S. Tomić did field research in Piva in 1912–13 and 1924, however, he recorded the Bajovići, called Čepuri in Gornje Rudinice with two houses, as hailing from Bajovo Polje and being direct descendants of Bajo Nikolić Pivljanin. Meanwhile, Tomić had recorded four or six houses of Bajovići in Bezuje that belonged to the Vračari brotherhood, itself descending from the Gagovići brotherhood. Other families claiming descent from his nephews are spread through Stara Raška and Šumadija in Serbia. There was a tale that Pivljanin put a curse on his family after seven of his brothers and cousins declined to join him in the hajduks. The Markovići brotherhood in Ljuljaci, Serbia, with the slava of St. John, settled in the first half of the 18th century, descending from one of Pivljanin's children. The Bajić brotherhood in Takovo, with the slava of St. George, numbering 30 households in 1960, also claim descent from him.  Epic poetry  The Cretan War is considered an \\"epical period of Serb history\\". Vuk Karadžić (1787–1864), the Serbian philologist and linguist, recorded several poems which mention Pivljanin which he published in his folklore collections. The poems fall into what is known as the \\"hajduk epic cycle\\". *Bajo Pivljanin i beg Ljubović, (\\"Bajo Pivljanin and Bey Ljubović\\", best known poem about him, recounting his victory in duel with Ljubović bey in Nevesinje, and his killing of Mato Njegošević who betrayed him). *Šta čini osveta, (\\"What does vengeance does\\", recounting how Bajo and Limun justifully aid Tašo Nikolić from Vasojevići in avenging the betrayal done by his brother-in-law Knez Ivaniš). *Sa šta Pivljanin Bajo ode u uskoke (\\"Why did Pivljanin Bajo became an uskok\\", recounting the early episode in his life when he killed Hasan-Aga Kopčić). *Bajo Pivljanin i Ale Novljanin, (\\"Bajo Pivljanin and Ale from Novi\\", same topic as \\"Bajo Pivljanin and Pasha of Zagorje\\", but with different characters). *Pivljanin Bajo i Ferat kapetan, (\\"Bajo Pivljanin and captain Ferhat\\", Bajo retaking the flock of sheep abducted by Muslim captain Ferhat somewhere around Golija mountain, losing one of his best men in the process). *Bajo Pivljanin i Marić alajbeg *Bajo Pivljanin i paša od Zagorja (\\"Bajo Pivljanin and Pasha of Zagorje\\", recounts how Bajo and Limun assaulted the wedding of Hadžija Rizvanbegović from Risan in Korita for tricking them, and killing his bride, the daughter of Čengić Pasha of Zagorje, in the process. The other version of the song is known as Rišnjanjin Hadžija i Limun trgovac (\\"Hadžija from Risan and Limun the trader\\")). *Hamza Mijatović i Pivljanin Bajo (\\"Hamza Mijatović and Pivljanin Bajo\\") *Zulum bez Baja *Ženidba Grbljičića Zana (\\"The wedding of Zane Grbičić\\") *Boj na Vrtijeljci (\\"Battle of Vrtijeljka\\") *Do tri harambaše Map of locations related to Bajo Pivljanin's life Annotations  References  Sources ;Books   ;Journals   *  Further reading    * External links * 17th-century births 1685 deaths Serbs of Montenegro Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Venetian Slavs Hajduks Republic of Venice military personnel killed in action Venetian period in the history of Montenegro Venetian period in the history of Croatia Republic of Venice military personnel Serbian military leaders 17th-century Serbian people Cretan War (1645–1669) Characters in Serbian epic poetry Trophy heads Burials at Serbian Orthodox monasteries and churches ","title":"Bajo Pivljanin"},{"id":"34265848","text":"Juinagar is a railway station on the Harbour Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network.

Nassella viridula. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. This grass forms tufts of stems up to about 1.2 meters tall. It grows from a fibrous root network which may penetrate over 1.5 meters deep in the soil. The leaves are mostly basal. Each is up to 30 centimeters long and tapers to a threadlike tip. The spikelets have awns reaching nearly 4 centimeters long, each bent twice.Nassella viridula. Grass Manual Treatment. The plant reproduces via seed and by tillering. The seeds may be dormant for a period of time and may require stratification to germinate. This grass is found in many types of habitat, including disturbed areas where it acts as a pioneer species. It is also considered a climax species in some regions, such as North Dakota. It is a dominant species and an indicator species in a variety of habitat types. It tolerates a wide range of temperatures and it is drought-tolerant. A number of animals utilize the plant for food and cover. Many waterfowl and other birds nest in it.

History Several countries have switched social security funding from payroll taxation or social security contributions on salaries and wages towards consumption taxation funding. Examples Denmark In 1987 Denmark introduced a wide-ranging tax reform with the aim of guaranteeing the viability of the social security system while permitting Danish companies to remain competitive. Initially employer payroll tax for unemployment and disability insurance was phased out and replaced by a VAT-like tax on consumption.http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id/ipa/06899.pdf The tax was later merged into the general VAT by increasing the VAT rate from 21% to 25%. Currently employer contributions are limited to contributions to the state pension fund ATP which also covers other contingencies such as maternity leave, salary guarantee and disability. Germany In 2007 Angela Merkel's government decided upon a 3%-point increase in the standard VAT rate (from 16% to 19%) and a simultaneous reduction of 1.8%-points in employer social security contributions by reducing the unemployment contingency by 2.3%-points and increasing the pension contribution by 0.5%-points. By reducing non-wage labour costs the measure had a positive impact on German competitiveness.{de} Earnings and labour costs study (in German), Destatis, Page 36 Hungary In 2009 Hungary decided a simultaneous 5% reduction in employer social security contributions and a 5% increase in VAT. France In his new year allocution French President Sarkozy announced that France would start to shift social security funding from labour to consumption.https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120103-702341.html Although not general in France, some overseas territories of France already introduced a shift from employer contributions to VAT under a 1994 law (loi Perben) to promote economic development in Martinique, Guadeloupe and Réunion.

The largest Christmas beetle, it can be over long. Taxonomy Edward Donovan described the King Christmas beetle in 1805 as Melolontha viridi-ænea, writing, \\"Nature seems to have devoted abundant attention to the embellishment of this common insect: its glow of colouring is peculiar and inimitable. The prevailing hues do not strictly please us by their harmony as their contrast, which is indeed striking, or rather glaring, but upon the whole produce a rich effect\\", describing it as \\"testaceous\\" (red-brown) overlain with translucent green and a brassy-gold sheen in light. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin words viridis \\"green\\" and aeneus \\"copper/bronze\\". The King Christmas beetle was described in 1817 as Rutela caesarea by Gustaf Johan Billberg and R. latreillei by Leonard Gyllenhaal. When Leach erected the genus Anoplognathus in 1815, he did not assign a type species. Phil Carne designated A. viridiaeneus as the type in 1957. Description The largest Christmas beetle, the adult male is 30–32 mm long and 16–19 mm wide at its broadest, while the female is 28–34 mm long and 16-19.5 mm wide. It is predominantly red-brown with gold-green overtone. The head has rose highlights, while the pronotum, scutellum and elytra have a gold sheen. The pygidium, coxae, and abdomen are a bright green, while the legs are red-brown, and tarsi are black. The female has flatter elytra than the male. Distribution This species is present in eastern Australia (New South Wales and Queensland). Once common around Sydney, it has all but vanished due to loss of habitat. Ecology The larvae feed on rotting wood, humus and grass roots. The King Christmas beetle has been recorded on the turpentine tree (Syncarpia glomulifera) of the family Myrtaceae.

She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste between June 1896 and May 1900, when she was commissioned into the fleet. Kaiser Karl VI represented a significant improvement over the preceding design——being faster and more heavily armed and armored. She provided the basis for the third design, , which featured further incremental improvements. Having no overseas colonies to patrol, Austria-Hungary built the ship solely to reinforce its battle fleet. Kaiser Karl VI spent the first decade in service rotating between the training and reserve squadrons, alternating with Sankt Georg. In 1910, Kaiser Karl VI went on a major overseas cruise to South America, visiting Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina; this was the last trans-Atlantic voyage of an Austro- Hungarian warship. After the outbreak of war, she was mobilized into the Cruiser Flotilla, which spent the majority of the war moored at Cattaro. The lengthy inactivity eventually led to the Cattaro Mutiny in February 1918, which the crew of Kaiser Karl VI joined. After the mutiny collapsed, Kaiser Karl VI and several other warships were decommissioned to reduce the number of idle sailors. After the war, she was allocated as a war prize to Britain and was sold to ship-breakers in Italy, where she was scrapped in 1920. Design , the basis of Kaiser Karl VIs design Starting in the mid-1880s, the new Austro-Hungarian Marinekommandant (Navy Commander), Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, began a reorientation of Austro-Hungarian naval strategy. The fleet had until then been centered on large ironclad warships, but had been unable to continue building vessels of that type under the direction of the previous Marinekommandant, Vizeadmiral Friedrich von Pöck, owing to the refusal of the Imperial Council of Austria and the Diet of Hungary to grant sufficient naval budgets. Sterneck decided to adopt the concepts espoused by the French Jeune École (Young School), which suggested that flotillas of cheap torpedo boats could effectively defend a coastline against a fleet of expensive battleships. The torpedo boats would be supported by what Sterneck termed \\"torpedo-ram-cruisers\\", which would protect the torpedo boats from enemy cruisers. In his fleet plan for 1891, Sterneck proposed that the future Austro-Hungarian fleet would consist of four squadrons, each consisting of one torpedo-ram-cruiser, a smaller torpedo cruiser, a large torpedo boat and six smaller torpedo boats. The first three of these squadrons would be led by the two protected cruisers and the armored cruiser , and in 1891 the design staff began work on the fourth cruiser. Three proposals were considered, the first modeled on , the second on the small protected cruiser , and the last derived from the British armored cruiser . All three designs displaced . But by the time work on Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia began that year, naval officers who opposed Sterneck's theories forced him to postpone the fourth cruiser in favor of beginning work on a new generation of capital ships, what would become the s. Those opposed to Sterneck believed the new cruisers should be formed into their own squadron to serve with the main battle fleet, and so in 1894, began preparations to build another armored cruiser. Three competing designs were submitted, two by the naval architect Josef Kellner and the third by Viktor Lollok. Kellner's initial design was for a ship similar to Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia, armed with the same battery of two guns and eight guns. The second was broadly similar with the same but differently arranged armament, and displacement increased to and two funnels instead of the one in his other design. Lollok's proposal was also 6,000 tons, and instead of carrying all eight 15 cm guns in main-deck casemates, four would be moved up to open mounts on the upper deck. The naval command selected Kellner's second design, although it mandated a change to water-tube boilers for increased engine power, which in turn necessitated the addition of a third funnel. She also received the latest version of 24 cm guns manufactured by the German firm Krupp: the longer- barreled SK L/40 C/94 version. The new cruiser, named Kaiser Karl VI, was about larger than her predecessor, Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia, and was a significantly more effective vessel as a result, being a knot faster, mounting more powerful guns, and carrying heavier armor. General characteristics and machinery Line-drawing of Kaiser Karl VI showing the disposition of the armament and armor Kaiser Karl VI was long at the waterline and was long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Having gained experience with the stability problems caused by Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresias military masts, Kaiser Karl VI was completed with lighter pole masts and a significantly smaller superstructure. Her crew varied between 535 and 550 officers and men over the course of her career. Kaiser Karl VI was fitted with two pole masts for observation. The ship's propulsion system consisted of two 4-cylinder triple- expansion engines that drove a pair of screw propellers. The engines were built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) shipyard in Trieste that built the ship. Steam was provided by water-tube Belleville boilers manufactured by Maudslay, Sons and Field of Britain. The engines were rated at for a top speed of , though on trials they produced a top speed of . Coal storage amounted to normally and up to under wartime loading. Armament and armor Kaiser Karl VI was armed with a main battery of two large-caliber guns and several medium-caliber pieces. She carried two 24 cm L/40 C/94 guns manufactured by Krupp in single gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and one aft. Eight L/40 guns mounted individually in casemates rounded out her offensive armament; these were carried in the main deck, two on either side amidships, sponsoned out over the hull, and two abreast both of the main battery turrets. She was armed with sixteen L/44 guns built by Škoda and two 4.7 cm L/33 Hotchkiss guns for close-range defense against torpedo boats. She carried several smaller weapons, including a pair of machine guns and two L/18 landing guns. Kaiser Karl VI was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. The ship's armor consisted of Harvey armor. She was protected by a main armored belt that was thick in the central portion that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces, and reduced to on either end. She had an armored deck that was thick. Her two gun turrets had thick faces, and the 15 cm guns had thick casemates. The conning tower had 200 mm thick sides and a thick roof. Service history Named for the 18th- century Holy Roman Emperor, Karl VI, Kaiser Karl VI was built at the STT shipyard in Trieste. Her keel was laid on 1 June 1896 and her completed hull was launched on 4 October 1898. Fitting-out work then commenced, which lasted until 23 May 1900 when the ship was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian fleet. Starting from her commissioning, Kaiser Karl VI frequently served in the training squadron, along with the three s, though she alternated in the squadron with the armored cruiser Sankt Georg. Once the summer training schedule was completed each year, the ships of the training squadron were demobilized in the reserve squadron, which was held in a state of partial readiness. In 1900, she served as the flagship of then-Rear Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli in the training squadron, along with Kaiserin und Königin Maria Theresia. During the summer maneuvers of June 1901, she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral G. Ritter von Brosch, commander of the reserve squadron. The other major ships in the squadron included the old ironclad and the cruiser Kaiser Franz Joseph I. In mid-1910, Kaiser Karl VI conducted the last trans- Atlantic cruise of an Austrian vessel, when she visited Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. On 25 May, she represented Austria-Hungary at the centennial of Argentina's May Revolution, which won the country's independence from Spain. World War I On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo; the assassination sparked the July Crisis and ultimately the First World War, which broke out a month later on 28 July. The German battlecruiser , which had been assigned to the Mediterranean Division, sought the protection of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and so Admiral Anton Haus sent the fleet, including Kaiser Karl VI, south on 7 August to assist his German ally. Goebens commander, Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, intended to use the Austro-Hungarian move as a feint to distract the British Mediterranean Fleet which was pursuing Goeben; Souchon instead took his ship to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. Their decoy mission complete, Kaiser Karl VI and the rest of the fleet returned to port without engaging any British forces. On 8 August, Montenegrin gun batteries on Mount Lovćen began shelling the Austro-Hungarian at Cattaro. At the time, Kaiser Karl VI was the only large warship in the harbor, and so she assisted the local army artillery in attempting to suppress the hostile guns. The Austro-Hungarian gunners were aided by navy seaplanes that could spot the fall of their shots. On 13 September, the three Monarch-class coastal defense ships arrived to strengthen the Austro-Hungarian force. Five days later, a French artillery battery was landed in Montenegro to reinforce the guns on Lovćen with the aim of eventually capturing the port, which prompted the Austro- Hungarians to send the pre-dreadnought battleship with its guns. By 27 October, the French and Montenegrin gun batteries had been silenced, and the French abandoned its attempt to seize Cattaro. Kaiser Karl VI on 22 May 1917 By the end of August, the mobilization of the fleet was complete; Kaiser Karl VI was assigned to the Cruiser Flotilla, which was commanded by Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler. For most of the war, the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though the armored cruisers were too slow to operate with the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations. In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought. By early 1918, the long periods of inactivity had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro, including Kaiser Karl VI. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard Sankt Georg and quickly spreading to Kaiser Karl VI. Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands, which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to an end to the war, based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The following day, shore batteries loyal to the government fired on the old ironclad , which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort. Late in the day on 2 February, the red flags were struck from Kaiser Karl VI and she rejoined the loyalist ships in the harbor. The next morning, the s of the III Division arrived in Cattaro, which convinced the last holdouts to surrender. Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly and four men were executed. Fate In the aftermath of the Cattaro Mutiny, most of the obsolete warships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, including Kaiser Karl VI, were decommissioned to reduce the number of idle warships. On 3 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending their participation in the conflict. After the end of the war, Kaiser Karl VI was ceded as a war prize to Great Britain, under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. She was then sold to ship breakers in Italy and broken up for scrap after 1920.

Willard was also a member of the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York and the President of the Underhill Society of America between 1932 and 1940. Biography Willard Underhill Taylor participated in the twenty-third Annual Commencement of Cornell University on June 18, 1891. Taylor, then of Lyons, New York, gave a commencement speech on \\"Progressive Americanism.\\" That day he received a Bachelor of Philosophy as well as a \\"Certificate for proficiency in military science.\\" The New York Times incorrectly referred to him as Willard N. Underhill. He was one of 250 degree earners to receive degrees that day from University President Adams. The Taylors had homes in both New York City and on Long Island. A \\"Supper Dance\\" at their home in Garden City for their daughter Mary M. Taylor, received coverage in The New York Times, owing to the impressive list of guests who attended. Taylor became an active player in the New York City real estate market starting in the late 1920s. One of his first important purchases was the Holland-Plaza Building, erected on a site owned by Trinity Church Corporation near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. He acquired a twenty-story building in New York City, at 423-27 Fourth Avenue, on the northeast corner of 29th Street in 1934 for over $1,000,000. The property was bought by Mr. Taylor through one of his holding companies, the Lortay Corporation. Building records show how 423-27 4th Ave was originally built in 1927 for $900,000 and was a 20 story terra cotta clad building with stores and offices. Taylor through his Lortay Corporation leased two more buildings, 100 Sixth Avenue and 345 Hudson Street, both in the Holland Tunnel plaza area, from Trinity Church Corporation in 1934. In 1936, the Taylor's acquired the Reginald Barclay seashore estate at North Haven called Ettington, where they made their summer home. Taylor was a lawyer and had offices at 74 Trinity Place in Manhattan. Willard Underhill Taylor, Sr., died in 1940. Among the associations he was involved in was the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York. His passing was recognized in a death notice in the New York Times. The death of Willard Underhill Taylor was noted in a 1940 issue of Time magazine. Myron Charles Taylor erected a substantial headquarters for the Boy and Girl Scouts of the Lyons area in memory of his two brothers Willard Underhill Taylor and Morgan Delling Taylor. Family Willard Underhill Taylor married Evelyn W. Keeler of Auburn, New York, on May 20, 1923. He and his wife had several children including Willard Underhill Taylor, Jr., Mary M. Taylor, and Annette Taylor. Following the death of Willard Underhill Taylor, his wife remarried F. Kenneth Stephenson on April 27, 1941. Following the death of her second husband, Evelyn Keeler relocated to San Antonio, Texas. She died on December 24, 1966, in Mexico City. Her funeral service was held in the Chapel of the Resurrection in the Cathedral of the Incarnation, in Garden City, on January 2, 1967. Annette Taylor died at the age of 13, when the sedan her governess Etta Dale Milliken was driving turned over veered off the road and turned over three miles north of East Hampton. Her brother Willard Underhill Taylor, Jr., was riding in the back seat at the time and escaped uninjured. Willard Underhill Taylor, Jr., served for four years in the Navy on underwater demolition during World War II. Because his father, Willard Underhill, Jr., was brother of Myron Charles Taylor, this made Willard Underhill Taylor a nephew. Willard Underhill Taylor, Jr. married Katherine Dickey Stevens on April 30, 1948. That marriage ended in divorce some time prior to 1956 when Stevens remarried. Stevens died at the age of 42 after a long illness. At the time of death she was living at 215 East 68th Street and getting treatment in the Harkness Pavilion, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Participation in Underhill Society Following the death of Willard Underhill Taylor, Sr., his brother Myron Charles Taylor was proposed as a Director for the Underhill Society. Despite actively being involved in affairs of the Underhill Society, Taylor declined. Following the death of John Garrett Underhill, Sr., who served as President of the Underhill Society, Myron Charles Taylor speculated about the possibility of placing the Underhill Society and Underhill Burying Ground under the control of the Nassau County Historical Society.

The ferry serves the Toronto Islands from a dock at Jack Layton Ferry Terminal in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It entered service in 1935, initially known as the \\"Shamrock\\". The ferry was built by John Inglis and Company. It was the first of three ferries built, to replace the aged ferries the City of Toronto inherited when it took over ferry operations from private industry. Initially, responsibility for operating a ferry service was assigned to the Toronto Transportation Commission. It is now operated by the Parks Division. After the death of Toronto industrialist William Inglis, who headed John Inglis and Company, in November 1935, the ferry was renamed in his honour by the Toronto City Council. Inglis also served as the president of the Canadian National Exhibition and was one of the governors of Toronto Western Hospital. In August 1948, the William Inglis participated in the saving of 12 persons, whose racing sloop had capsized in Toronto Harbour. Three of the twelve clinging to the mast were brought aboard the ferry before speedboats arrived from the John St. Lifesaving Station and recovered the others. In 2012, the boat's engine and bulkhead were updated. Although the boat was exempt from 2012 safety regulations under a \\"grandfather clause\\", the modernization invalidated the grandfather provision.

It was written by Lee Goldberg, and was published by Signet Books on December 1, 2009. Like the other Monk novels, the story is narrated by Natalie Teeger, the assistant of the title character, Adrian Monk. Plot summary Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger arrive in Trouble, California, a small town known for an unsolved train robbery that happened there in 1962. In the 1840s, Trouble was also home to one of Monk's distant relatives, an assayer who possessed skills invaluable to the small town, and exhibited many of the same obsessive compulsive traits as Adrian. Monk discovers that these seemingly uncorrelated historical facts are connected to the murder of a museum security guard in Trouble who was a retired San Francisco police officer. The Case of the Piss-Poor Gold The novel featured a short story entitled The Case of the Piss-Poor Gold, which was published before the novel was released in the November 2009 issue of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.

The New York Times described him as \\"one of the true fathers of the nuclear submarine program\\". From 1927 to 1947, Gunn worked at the Naval Research Laboratory. He was the author of over 28 papers, and received 45 patents. He designed radio devices for controlling aircraft, which were used in the development of the first drones. He was one of the first to appreciate the possibility of using nuclear power for submarine propulsion. During World War II he was involved in the development of thermal diffusion technology for isotope separation. After the war Gunn became director of the Weather Bureau's Physical Research Division, where he carried out a series of studies into atmospheric phenomena. In 1958 he became a professor of physics at American University, a position he held until his death in 1966. Early life Ross Gunn was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 12, 1897, the son of R. D. A. Gunn, a physician, and his wife Laura Conner Gunn. He was one of four children, with an older brother and sister and a younger brother. His parents also had a set of twins who died at birth. When he was seven years old, the family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, where his father had a medical practice. He attended Oberlin High School, from which he graduated in 1915, and then attended Oberlin College for two years. As a teenager, he was interested in amateur radio, which in those days meant building as well as operating your own set. During summer vacations he worked as a radio operator on the SS Seeandbee, a passenger ship on the Great Lakes, and for the Glenn L. Martin Company. After two years at Oberlin, he transferred to the University of Michigan because it had a better electrical engineering program. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Gunn enlisted in the United States Army Signal Corps, but remained at the University of Michigan as a military radio instructor. He returned to his studies when the war ended, his income supplemented by work as an instructor, and received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) degree from the University of Michigan in 1920. He then studied physics there, earning a Master of Science (MS) in 1921. He started work on his doctorate, but became bored, and accepted an offer from the Army to work at McCook Field as an aircraft radio research engineer. He developed various forms of aircraft instrumentation, participated in a number of cross-country instrument flights, and designed radio devices for controlling aircraft, for which he received the first of 45 patents that he would eventually accumulate. These were used in the development of the first drones, which were used as practice targets for antiaircraft gunnery. In September 1923, Gunn married Gladys J. Rowley, an Oberlin College alumna. They had four sons: Ross Jr., Leigh, Charles and Robert Burns. The experience at McCook convinced him that he had been too hasty in abandoning his studies, so that year he quit to take a job as an instructor at Yale University, where he was placed in charge of the High Frequency laboratory at the Physics Department. He earned his doctorate there in 1926, writing his thesis on \\"Three New Methods in Electrical Measurements\\". Naval Research Laboratory In August 1927, Gunn accepted a position with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), becoming assistant superintendent of the Heat and Light Division in 1928. This was a prolific period for him. Between 1929 and 1933, he published 28 papers, including 13 in the Physical Review. He could choose his own topics of research, and chose to study natural phenomena such as cosmic rays and terrestrial and solar magnetism. In 1933, he became superintendent of the Mechanics and Electricity Division and technical adviser to the laboratory director. The 1938 discovery of nuclear fission aroused great interest among physicists. On March 17, 1939, Enrico Fermi gave a presentation to the Navy on the state of nuclear research, and the possibility of the development of atomic bombs and nuclear power. Gunn was in attendance as the NRL representative. Gunn was impressed by the possibility of utilizing nuclear power to propel ships, particularly submarines, as nuclear power would not require oxygen. On March 20, Gunn and the director of the NRL, Captain Hollis M. Cooley, approached Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr., the head of the Bureau of Engineering, which controlled funding for the NRL, with a request for $1,500 for research into uranium. This was approved; the Navy's program predated the Army's Manhattan Project by seven months. Niels Bohr had theorized that only the uranium-235 isotope was fissile, so the first step was to determine a means of separating it from the more abundant uranium-238. The NRL placed contracts with universities to study four different methods of isotope separation: gaseous diffusion, ultra centrifuge, mass spectrograph, and thermal diffusion. Thermal diffusion was not initially regarded as very promising, but Gunn was impressed by Philip Abelson's efforts on it. He recruited Abelson, who became a Navy employee in June 1941, and the Navy pressed ahead with thermal diffusion, constructing a pilot plant at Anacostia in June 1941. Gunn was a member of the Uranium Committee that coordinated the early Army, Navy and civilian research efforts, but as the Manhattan Project ramped up in 1942, the NRL effort became dwarfed and sidelined, and the NRL was no longer informed of the Army's progress. The thermal diffusion effort continued, however. In June 1944, the Manhattan Project decided to take it up, and constructed the S-50 thermal diffusion plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Although incapable of producing weapons grade uranium, S-50 was able to produce slightly enriched uranium, which was then fed into K-25 and Y-12 for further enrichment by gaseous diffusion or the electromagnetic process. S-50 was credited with shortening World War II by eight days. Gunn was awarded the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award by the Secretary of the Navy, James Forrestal, on September 4, 1945. His citation read: Once the war was over, Gunn returned to the proposal to use nuclear energy to power submarines. He organized a symposium at NRL on November 19, 1945. Papers were presented that argued that nuclear powered submarines would be able to operate submerged for years without refueling. The possibility of firing ballistic missiles from submerged submarines was also raised. Bowen and Commodore Deak Parsons arranged for naval personnel, including Hyman Rickover, to be assigned to the Manhattan Project to learn about the new technology. This would lead to the nuclear navy that Gunn had envisioned. Later life Gunn left the NRL for the United States Weather Bureau in February 1947. Although he had only a small staff and limited funds, he carried out a series of studies into atmospheric phenomena. He was director of the United States Air Force-Weather Bureau Cloud Physics Project from 1947 to 1949, and was a member of the Air Force's Scientific Advisory Board from 1948 to 1953. He was also a consultant for the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1958 to 1965. His interest in atmospheric physics continued after 1958, when he left the Weather Bureau to become a research professor in physics at the American University in Washington, DC. He remained in this job until his death there on October 15, 1966.

History The hospital project was founded in 1892 by Canon William Henry Cooper and his second wife, and opened initially as a hostel in Beaumont Street accommodating seven patients before moving to larger premises at 16 Nottingham Place in 1894. In 1904 two houses were acquired in Fitzroy Square. Each was rebuilt, the first being opened by Queen Alexandra in 1907, and the second opened by Queen Mary in 1923. The Queen Mother visited the hospital in 1957. In 1994, the hospital was refurbished and redeveloped in a scheme designed by architect Ronald Wylde Associates. On 17 January 1995, it was rededicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and officially reopened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, on 8 March 1995.

Option B was planned as a line past Dorenburg castle (to the north of Grefrath) towards Hinsbeck and southeast of Leuth towards Kaldenkirchen. The realised route corresponded to the proposed option C. There were also considerations for a short time of building a branch line from Lobberich via Boisheim to Waldniel. From Kaldenkirchen the line ran parallel to the Venlo–Viersen line of the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft), so that both lines appeared to form a double-track line. Today, the remaining tracks on this section of the line are considered to form the Venlo–Viersen line. After the end of operations, the section between Kempen and Grefrath was rebuilt as a cycle path. It is now planned to convert the remaining Grefrath-Kaldenkirchen section into a cycle path. Operations  Operations were initially carried out with locomotive-hauled trains, but from the early 1960s, as a result of increasing motorisation, services were operated by the so-called \\"saviour of branch lines\\", Uerdingen railbuses (class VT 95), which were eventually replaced by battery powered railcars of class 515. The track facilities in Grefrath and Lobberich were dismantled as far as possible. The station building in Lobberich was demolished 1976, Grefrath station now houses a youth club and Mulhouse station is currently used as a restaurant. After the abandonment of passenger services on the entire route on 22 May 1982 and the abandonment of freight between Kempen and Grefrath on 28 May 1983, there was still thriving freight traffic on the remaining Grefrath–Kaldenkirchen section (including Lobberich), but it was strongly restricted in the early 1990s and it was completely stopped on 31 December 1999. Most of the class 290 diesel locomotives operated on weekdays to two private sidings, Lobbericher freight yard and the freight yard behind Grefrath station. The last passenger train that ran on the line between Lobberich and Kaldenkirchen was a special train which was used for shooting a film in 1991.

It was constructed in 1848.  History  The construction of the temple was initiated originally planned by Shet Hathisinh Kesarisinh, a wealthy Ahmedabad trader who died at 49. The construction was supervised and completed by his wife Shethani Harkunvar. The total cost was approximately Rs. 8 lakh., then a major sum. The temple is dedicated to Lord Dharmanatha, the fifteenth Jain Tirthankar. Lockwood de Forest who was a business associate of Muggenbhai Hutheesing, the son of Sheth Hathisinh, estimated the cost as \\"over a million dollars\\". The temple was built during a severe famine in Gujarat. Building the temple employed hundreds of skilled artisans which supported them for a period of two years. The temple is managed by a Hutheesing family trust. Currently, the temple is undergoing renovation and restoration during which natural ingredients extracted from palm cactus, aloe vera, tamarind mixed with sand, lime jaggery and so on are being used by a workforce of some 125 skilled workers under Architect Shri U.

Churches * The Roman Catholic Church of St. Fidelis was built in 1908 in Landquart village. * The current Reformed church in Igis village was built to its current appearance in 1486. At that time, the nave was extended to the south and the choir was expanded. The main portal was also built in 1486, as this date is carved into the stone. The paintings on the north-east wall date from before the 1486 renovation. It is believed that this wall is part of St. Damian's Church in Ovine that was mentioned in 841, though this identification is debated. Part of the identification rests on the fact that the bell of the church contains an inscription that indicates that it was dedicated to Cosmas and Damian. Regardless, the current church is clearly mentioned about 1300 in the records of Pfäfers Abbey.History of the Igis Church * The Church in Landquart village was built in the 20th Century as the village section grew. The land was acquired in 1914, though construction began only in 1925.

Physical Oceanographers use high capacity lithium battery packs for long term deployments to extend the duration of the deployments and gather more data. Oceanographers often work in far away sites that are difficult to get to. The cost of getting to these remote sites, often by ship, can dominate the cost of an investigation. This motivates oceanographers to extend the duration of their deployments so that they can visit them less often. This means, among other things, increasing the capacity of their battery packs. Reasons for use When possible, oceanographers use alkaline batteries because they are inexpensive and readily available. However, when alkaline batteries provide insufficient capacity, oceanographers turn to lithium battery packs, which can supply three times the capacity. Battery packs based on lithium thionyl chloride chemistry cost more than alkaline battery packs, but they provide roughly three times the energy density at about 60% of the weight (both by volume). Lithium batteries have other advantages as well. They produce negligible gas, and what gas is produced is contained in hermetically sealed metal containers. The voltage over the life of the pack varies considerably less than the voltage of an alkaline pack. Low current lithium cells also have relative low self- discharge, losing less than 10% of their capacity in 10 years. Battery Pack Design Fig. 1. Left. Lithium cell voltage profile, compared with an alkaline cell. Both profiles assume depletion using the same constant power. Fig. 2. Right. Comparison of stored charge vs. voltage for HLCs and large capacitors. Over narrow voltage ranges, the HLC's stored charge increases as voltage increases, with slopes that look like 500 F -1400 F capacitors. Doppler Ltd. oceanographic battery packs use Tadiran's TL6930http://www.dopplerltd.com/TL-6930.pdf low current lithium thionyl chloride primary cells combined with small rechargeable cells called Hybrid Layer Capacitors (HLC).http://www.dopplerltd.com/HLC-1550A.pdf Low current lithium cells cannot supply the currents required for many applications, but they store more energy than high current cells. High current cells use spiral wound electrodes, that is, electrodes built in sheets wrapped in a spiral inside the cell. The large surface area of the sheets increases the current that the cell can supply. Low current cells use bobbin electrodes, a simpler design consisting of an inner anode, an outer layer of metallic lithium, and electrolyte between the two. This design is less costly to manufacture, and it stores more energy. Cell characteristics The TL6930 cells work well over typical ocean temperatures (0-40 °C), and for typical ocean deployments (1 month - 2 years). At a temperature of 5-10 °C, one TL6930 holds roughly three times the energy of the same size alkaline cell. Most of that difference is accounted by the lithium cell's higher voltage (nominally 3.8 VDC vs. 1.5 VDC). Fig. 1 provides an example of how the voltage on these cells varies with time, assuming both cells supply the same continuous power. The lithium cell lasts 3 times as long as an alkaline cell, and sustains a more constant voltage during its life. Primary lithium cells also hold several times the capacity of rechargeable lithium cells. Hybrid layer capacitors Most oceanographic instruments use little power most of the time, and they require high currents only for short durations. Examples are instrument systems that telemeter data through Iridium, and acoustic modems (e.g. from Benthos or Link-Quest). ADCPs also require short pulses of high current to support high power acoustic transmissions. HLCs are the key that enable low current lithium battery packs to supply short pulses of high current. HLCs are actually rechargeable lithium cells that behave like huge capacitors over a narrow voltage range (Fig. 2). Cell arrangement Fig. 3. Schematic of a typical Pulses Plus battery pack. The components are: 1) Primary lithium cell, 2) HLC, 3,4) Schottky diode, 5,6) PTC, 7) Safety circuit. Most alkaline battery packs used by oceanographers are built with strings of cells. A typical alkaline battery pack often consists of a number of strings of alkaline cells, all connected in parallel to increase the total capacity. PulsesPlus packs take the opposite approach. Packs are constructed in \\"branches\\" of parallel primary cells, each branch charging one or more HLCs. The HLC sources most of the current when high currents are required, then the HLCs slowly recharge at a low current from the primary cells. The cell's low current enables it to work more efficiently. High current dissipates energy as heat inside low current cells and has other detrimental affects. These reduce the energy available to power instrumentation. Combining the primary lithium cells with HLCs enables the pack to deliver more of its stored energy to the instrument system. Short circuit protection Fig. 3 shows a typical Pulses Plus schematic. The pack includes diodes in each branch to minimize the possibility of reverse charging the cells. PTCs, or positive temperature coefficient thermistors act as resettable fuses. PTCs begin to get warm at a trip current. The warmth increases their resistance which produces even more heat, and the PTC quickly \\"trips\\" and shuts off most of the current. The PTC rarely trips in a typical ADCP pack, because the safety circuit is the primary protection against short circuits (defined to be any current above about 8 A). The safety circuit also turns off the pack before its voltage falls below a threshold. If the pack were allowed to fully discharge, one branch could discharge before the others, which could lead to the discharged branch being charged by the remaining cells. Any attempt to charge a lithium cell is potentially dangerous, and turning the pack off at about 75-80% of its starting voltage prevents this from happening. At this voltage, only around 3% of the capacity remains, but the remaining capacity still allows years for disposal of the pack before it discharges fully. Pre-Deployment Test Because oceanographers spend considerable time and money in long term deployments, then wait to see the results, oceanographers invest extraordinary efforts prior to deployments to ensure the success of their experiments. One of their concerns is battery failure. Doppler Ltd's Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) batteries provide an example of lithium battery packs that an oceanographer can test prior to deployment. These battery packs are commonly used in RD Instruments Workhorse Sentinel and Long Ranger and in Nortek's AWAC. These lithium packs, based on Tadiran's PulsesPlus technology are designed considerably differently from typical alkaline battery packs. Safety circuit Fig. 4. Safety circuit behind a plastic window on a lithium battery pack. In additions to its safety functions, the safety circuit also provides a self test that confirms the health of the pack in advance of a deployment. If there is no window with an LED behind it, the pack should not be shorted. Only battery packs with safety circuits instantly turn off the pack in response to a short circuit. Self test The self test indicates that the battery and its safety circuit work, that the battery voltage is within an acceptable range, that the battery can supply an 8 A pulse of current, and that the battery will protect itself against a short. The test confirms that the battery pack is new. If a new battery tests used, the supplier should be contacted. In some circumstances, a battery that is stored at a cold temperature could produce a test result that indicates it has been used, even though it holds its full original capacity. What to do if a \\"good\\" battery fails to run an instrument Some instruments have current limiters on their inputs. The most common example is the RD Instruments Workhorse. When a current limiter fails, the instrument draws enough current to trigger the battery's short circuit protection, and the instrument fails to run. When this happens, plug in the AC adapter (which charges the ADCP's internal capacitor bank), then plug in the battery. The instrument will now run normally. \\"Used\\" and \\"depleted\\" The safety circuit determines that a pack has been used when its voltage falls below a threshold, or if it detects a minimum number of pulses. Testing a pack is not normally sufficient to cause it to become \\"used\\", but normal operation should make it \\"used\\" around the time 1% of its capacity has been depleted. The safety circuit causes the pack to become \\"depleted\\" when it falls below its end-of-life voltage and turns off. A used pack will continue to function normally, but a depleted pack can no longer be used.

They subsequently joined the cause of the Serbian guerrilla fighters (\\"chetniks\\") against the Ottomans. Unusually combative and revolutionary for being a former monk, he was nicknamed \\"Gapon\\" after Russian Orthodox monk and working-class leader Georgy Gapon, by his fellow guerrilla fighters. When the Serbian Chetnik Assembly were to appoint the voivode of Skoplje, Gapon suggested giving it to young veteran fighter Kosta Pećanac — all members agreed, and in a great meeting at Christmas 1904, Pećanac received the title at only 25 years old.Đurić-Mijović 1993, 92Voskom zavaravali glad Gapon fought in the units of Doksim Mihailović and then Kosta Pećanac, being an active Chetnik until his death.

History The University College Hospital, (UCH) Ibadan was established by an August 1952 Act of Parliament in response to the need for the training of medical personnel and other healthcare professionals for the country and the West African Sub- Region. The establishment of the Hospital followed a Visitation Panel in 1951 to assess the clinical facilities for the clinical postings of medical students registered for M.B.B.S. degree of the University of London. The visitation panel, led by Dr. T.F. Hunt of the University of London rejected the enhanced facilities provided by the Government/Native Authority Hospital at Adeoyo, Ibadan following the establishment of a Faculty of Medicine in the University College, Ibadan (now University of Ibadan) in 1948. The University College Hospital (UCH) was strategically located in Ibadan, then the largest city in West Africa which is also the seat of the first University in Nigeria. The physical development of the Hospital commenced in 1953 in its present site and was formally commissioned after completion on 20 November 1957. The University College Hospital, Ibadan was initially commissioned with 500-bed spaces. Currently, the hospital has 1,000 bed spaces and 200 examination couches with occupancy rates ranging from 65-70%. The Hospital, at inception in 1957, prior to the Act of Parliament, had two clinical Departments (Medicine and Surgery). However, the Hospital has evolved to accommodate about 65 Departments among which is the first Department of Nuclear Medicine in Nigeria commissioned by the former Honourable Minister of Health, Professor Eyitayo Lambo on 27 April 2006. The Hospital and the University of Ibadan, function in excellent symbiosis and it is impossible to think of one without the other, in the areas of health manpower training, research and clinical service. This functional interdependence was emphasized from inception through the appointment of the Chairman of the Provisional Council of the University College, (now University of Ibadan as the first Chairman of the Board of Management of the University College Hospital, Ibadan. In addition to undergraduate medical programme (Based in the College of Medicine of the University of Ibadan), the UCH also provides for: Postgraduate Residency Training Programmes in all specialties of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Pediatrics, Otorhinolaryngology, Ophthalmology, Anesthesia, Laboratory Medicine, Psychiatry, Community Medicine, General Medical Practice, Radiology, Radiotherapy and Dentistry. The University College Hospital also provides diploma /professional programmes in the School of Health Records & Statistics, Environmental Health Officers Tutors Course; Primary Health tutors Course, Nurse/Midwife/Public Health Nurse, Nurse Tutors Course, Post registration Courses in nursing e.g. Peri Operative nursing and Occupational Health Nursing. The Hospital is primarily a tertiary institution with appendages of community-based outreach activities at Igbo Ora, Abedo, Okuku, Sepeteri, Elesu, and Jago where it offers primary and secondary health care services. The Hospital has about 65 service and clinical departments and runs 96 consultative out-patient clinics a week in 50 specialty and sub- specialty disciplines. In addition to the College of Medicine, the Hospital \\"houses\\" a Virology Research laboratory, a W.H.O Collaborating Centre in Immunology and an Institute of Advanced Medical Research and Training.(IAMRAT). The Hospital also houses the Special Treatment Clinic (STC), a state-of-the-art clinic for research, training, and treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and runs clinics for people living with HIV/AIDS. Accreditation has been given for the setting up of a department of nuclear medicine whilst approval has also been given by the Federal Ministry of Health for the establishment of an Institute of Neurosciences. Satellite Pharmacies are provided on each specialty floor for easy access for the procurement of drugs for patients on admission. A Pain Clinic and a Hospice Service are also on site for the care of terminally ill patients. The Hospital also house the first and only Geriatric Centre in sub Saharan Africa, the Chief Tony Anenih Geriartric Centre (CTAGC). Since its inception, the Hospital has trained over 6,000 Doctors, 501 Dentists, 4,513 Nurses, 2307 Midwives, 471 Peri-Operative nurses, 1062 Laboratory Scientist, 576 Environmental Health officers Tutors, 451 nurse/midwives/Public health educators, 326 Primary Health Care Tutors, 590 Community Health Officers, 640 Physiotherapists, 551 Health information Management Personnel (formally referred to as Medical Records Officers).As a result of the breakdown of primary healthcare facilities in the region, the Hospital, though a tertiary healthcare facility, still caters for a lot of the primary and secondary healthcare burden. The patients turn out in the Emergency Department of the Hospital averages 6500 annually and about 150,000 new patients are seen in the various out-patient clinics every year. In 2001, the million clientele mark was attained. Due to the aforementioned facilities, manpower and track records, the Hospital enjoy a wide patronage of both national and international clientele. The management of the Hospital spurred by the Federal Government's efforts in refurbishing the teaching hospital has taken steps to widen the scope of services provided by the resuscitation of the open heart surgical procedure of the Hospital. In May 2006, a surgical team successfully performed open-heart surgery on three paediatric patients, an important landmark in medicine in Nigeria.! Further, the hospital has performed 38 more open heart surgeries on patients with acquired and congenital heart diseases since then with 100% success rate.

During his career, he suppressed the insurrection at Setif, Algeria, in May 1945. Biography Early life Duval was born in Montpellier, France, on 19 September 1894, the son of a military officer. As a child, he studied at the Prytanée National Militaire, a military school in La Flèche. He entered the French military academy at Saint-Cyr in 1912 and graduated as a sous-lieutenant (second lieutenant) on 2 August 1914, the day before France entered World War I. World War I France and Germany exchanged declarations of war on 3 August 1914 as World War I began. At the outset of the war, Duval participated in the Battle of the Frontiers, and was taken prisoner by German forces at Maubeuge on 7 September 1914. He escaped on 13 September 1914 and joined the 9th Zouave Regiment, with which he spent the rest of the war. He participated in the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, and was seriously wounded on 16 September 1914. For his actions, he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour at the age of 20 on 15 November 1914. After several months of hospital care, he returned to the front and participated in the First Battle of Champagne (20 December 1914–17 March 1915), the Second Battle of Champagne (25 September–6 November 1915), and the early stages of the Battle of Verdun, which began in February 1916. He was promoted to capitaine (captain) on 18 May 1916 and participated in the Battle of the Somme (1 July–18 November 1916), during which he was taken prisoner on 15 November 1916 in Saint-Pierre-Waast. While a prisoner-of-war, he made three unsuccessful escape attempts. He finally succeeded in escaping on his fourth attempt on 16 October 1918. Interwar period After World War I ended, Duval participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, serving in Siberia with the mission of General Maurice Janin until 20 June 1920. He served in Syria in 1921, then joined the 27th Chasseurs Alpins Battalion in Annecy in 1922. He studied at the École supérieure de guerre (French war college) from 1924 to 1926, then was assigned in 1926 to the staff of the 19th Army Corps in Algiers, his first assignment in Algeria. He married on 1 June 1927. He was promoted to commandant on 25 December 1932. Transferred to Fez in French Morocco, he participated in the High Atlas campaign at the end of the pacification of Morocco. From 1933 to 1935, he was deputy head of the resident general's cabinet in French Morocco. From 1935 to 1939, he was on the general staff and supreme commander of troops in French Morocco. World War II World War II broke out in September 1939. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in December 1939, Duval was transferred to Metz to serve on the Maginot Line with the 3rd Army. During the Battle of France, he was taken prisoner along with the general staff by the Germans on 22 June 1940, the day France surrendered to Germany. He escaped to Vichy France soon after. Serving in the army of Vichy France, Duval was promoted to colonel on 25 September 1941, and left for Ankara as a military attaché in Turkey. Upon his return to France in October 1942, he took command of the 159th Alpine Infantry Regiment in Grenoble. After the German invasion of the unoccupied zone of France in November 1942, he entered the French Resistance. He escaped from France with General Alphonse Joseph Georges by plane on 20 May 1943 and joined the Free French forces. After various commands in French North Africa, he was transferred in May 1944 to the French Expeditionary Corps in Italy as commander of the divisional infantry of the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division, and during that tour of duty was promoted to général de brigade on 25 June 1944. He liberated Siena in July 1944 while in command of the division. Landing in Provence in Operation Dragoon — the Allied invasion of southern France — in August 1944 with the French 1st Army, he advanced up the Rhône with his troops. He entered combat in the Vosges in December 1944. Setif insurrection On 8 March 1945, Duval was transferred to Algeria to serve as commander of the Constantine departement there. On 8 May 1945, the day Germany surrendered to the Allies, bringing World War II to an end in Europe, riots began in Sétif, west of Constantine, and native Algerians began killing French settlers in the surrounding countryside of Sétif Province. Unrest also occurred in Guelma Province. In response, Duval carried out very harsh and controversial policing operations that became known as the Sétif and Guelma massacre. Later career In November 1945, General Charles de Gaulle appointed Duval supreme commander of French troops in Tunisia. He served in that capacity until 1949, and was promoted to général de division on 20 August 1946. From 1949 to 1955, he was supreme commander of French troops in Morocco, and he was promoted to général de corps d'armée on 7 February 1951 and then to général d'armée on 1 August 1954. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor on 6 August 1955. On 22 August 1955, while he was carrying out operations to maintain order after riots in Oued Zem and Khénifra in French Morocco, Duval died when his plane, which he flew himself, crashed near Kasba Tadla in the foothills of the Moroccan Atlas Mountains.

Stipple engraving is a technique used to create tone in an intaglio print by distributing a pattern of dots of various sizes and densities across the image. The pattern is created on the printing plate either in engraving by gouging out the dots with a burin, or through an etching process. Stippling was used as an adjunct to conventional line engraving and etching for over two centuries, before being developed as a distinct technique in the mid-18th century. The technique allows for subtle tonal variations and is especially suitable for reproducing chalk drawings. Early history Stipple effects were used in conjunction with other engraving techniques by artists as early as Giulio Campagnola (c.1482 – c. 1515) and Ottavio Leoni (1578–1630), although some of Campagnola's small prints were almost entirely in stipple.Mark J. Zucker in Kristin L. Spangenberg (ed), Six Centuries of Master Prints: Treasures from the Herbert Greer French collection, Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, nos 39 & 40, In Holland in the seventeenth century, the printmaker and goldsmith Jan Lutma developed an engraving technique, known as opus mallei, in which the dots are punched into the plate by an awl struck with a hammer, while in England the faces of portraits were engraved with stippled dots by William Rogers in the sixteenth century and Lucas Vorsterman in the seventeenth. Eighteenth century The Duchess of Richmond, a stipple engraving portrait by William Wynne Ryland after Angelica Kauffman (1775) An etched stipple technique known as the crayon manner, suitable for producing imitations of chalk drawings, was pioneered in France. Gilles Demarteau used in 1756 goldsmith's chasing tools and marking- wheels to shade the lines in a series of Trophies designed by Antoine Watteau. Jean-Charles François who was a partner of Demarteau further developed the technique and used it to engrave the whole plate. François engraved in 1757 three etchings directly on copper in crayon manner. He then used the technique to etch three plates using different-size needles bound together. Other people who contributed to this new engraving technique included Alexis Magny and Jean-Baptiste Delafosse.Gerald W. R. Ward, 'The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art', Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 153 William Wynne Ryland, who had worked with Jean-Charles François, took the crayon manner to Britain, using it in his contributions to Charles Roger’s publication A Collection of Prints in imitation of Drawings, and developing it further under the name of \\"stipple engraving\\". The process of stipple engraving is described in T.H. Fielding's Art of Engraving (1841). To begin with an etching \\"ground\\" is laid on the plate, which is a waxy coating that makes the plate resistant to acid. The outline is drawn out in small dots with an etching needle, and the darker areas of the image shaded with a pattern of close dots. As in mezzotint use was made of roulettes, and a mattoir to produce large numbers of dots relatively quickly.Griffiths, 78 Then the plate is bitten with acid, and the etching ground removed. The lighter areas of shade are then laid in with a drypoint or a stipple graver; Fielding describes the latter as \\"resembling the common kind, except that the blade bends down instead of up, thereby allowing the engraver greater facility in forming the small holes or dots in the copper\\". The etched middle and dark tones would also be deepened where appropriate with the graver. In France the technique fed a fashion for reproductions of red chalk drawings by artists such as Antoine Watteau and François Boucher. Gilles Demarteau etched 266 drawings of Boucher in stipple, for printing in an appropriate sanguine-coloured ink and framing.Griffiths, Antony, Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques, pp 81, British Museum Press (in UK), 2nd ed., 1996 ; Mayor, Hyatt A., Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 587-588, These prints so resembled red chalk drawings that they could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of residences.Alpheus Hyatt Mayor, Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1 January 1971, p. 589 A group of soldiers, in crayon manner technique by Gilles Demarteau after Charles André van Loo In England the technique was used for \\"furniture prints\\" with a similar purpose, and became very popular, though regarded with disdain by producers of the portrait mezzotints that dominated the English portrait print market. Stipple competed with mezzotint as a tonal method of printmaking, and while it lacked the rich depth of tone of mezzotint, it had the great advantage that far more impressions could be taken from a plate. During the late eighteenth century, some printmakers, including Francesco Bartolozzi, began to use colour in stipple engraving. Rather than using separate plates for each colour, as in most colour printing processes of the time, such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon's three-colour mezzotint method, the different colours were carefully applied with a brush to a single plate for each impression, a highly skilled operation which soon proved economically unviable. This method is also known as à la poupée after the French term for the small cotton pads used for the inking.NGA Washington References External links * Engraving Printmaking Etching ","title":"Stipple engraving"},{"id":"34266726","text":"Friedrich Siebenrock Friedrich Siebenrock (20 January 1853, Schörfling am Attersee - 28 January 1925, Vienna) was an Austrian herpetologist.

He discovered and reconstructed the Celtic harp of the Middle Ages, and, along with his harpist son Alan Stivell, was responsible for its revival in Brittany in the 1950s.  Biography   Early life  Georges (Jord or Jorj in Breton) Cochevelou was born on May 16, 1889 in the rue Vercingétorix (Vercingétorix Street) of the 14th arrondissement of Paris. His father was a native of Nouec Vihan in Gourin, and his mother of Pontivy. Georges was baptised in Vannetais territory in the south of Brittany, after which his family moved away from Paris. He was raised for some years by his maternal grandmother in Moustoir-Ac, and lived in Morbihan until he was thirty years old.  Career  He was raised as a speaker of Gwenedeg before he became a soldier in World War I. He was wounded and taken prisoner in Germany in 1917. On Armistice of 11 November 1918, he was in Poland, where he studied Polish and Russian. After the war he worked as a banker, administrator and interpreter, but his real passion was for the arts. He was a winner in the Lépine competition for several artistic works: he made an \\"astignomètre\\" (an ophthalmological device), created a table lamp (sold by Lancel - French leatherwear), built furniture like a cabinetmaker (French polish and marquetry) and painted in an original technique \\"of water-color in oil\\" on panels of hardboard painted in white, which were shown at an exhibition of independent artists at the academy of Raymond Duncan. On August 1, 1932, he married Fanny-Julienne Dobroushkess, native of Baltic states, from which her father, Hain-Woulf Dobroushkess was an emigrant. She gave birth to their son, Jean, in December, 1935. On the eve of the Second World War Georges was fifty years old, and although he was over the age limit for his rank (captain of the reserves) and not ably fit, he considered it his duty to answer the call and was allocated to the east army to Épinal and to Saint-Dié. His wife and their son joined him in the spring of 1940. Their second child Yves was born on May 18, 1940 in Épinal. At the beginning of June, the east army started their withdrawal. They travelled for a week before finding a family near Villeneuve- sur-Lot. Georges eventually found employment in Châtel-Guyon where his family lived until autumn 1945.Laurent Bourdelas, Alan Stivell, Le Télégramme Editions, 2012, p. 19 On January 6, 1944, Alan Cochevelou, the future Alan Stivell, was born. A short time later, the family settled down in Paris again. At that time Georges was working as an English interpreter and contract employee for the Ministry of Finance where he translated documents to French from English, Russian, Polish and Spanish. Fanny was working in the secretarial department of the civic and social Feminine Union, at 25 Rue de Valois. Cochevelou lived for five years in a small apartment on the boulevard of Belleville. They then lived on Rue Marne, then in Vincennes. Georges adopted ideas appropriate to the right-wing middle class, despite he and his family having relatively low incomes.Laurent Bourdelas, Alan Stivell, Le Télégramme Editions, 2012, p. 22 His wife Fanny encouraged him to resume contact with family members remaining in Brittany. Gradually Georges' interest in Brittany was rekindled, particularly in the Breton movement, of which he had never completely lost sight. One of his passions was in cabinetmaking—he made furniture and musical instruments. Furthermore, he played the piano, the transverse flute and the oboe. He tried to recreate the Celtic harp, an instrument forgotten when the Duchy of Brittany lost its independence, at the end of the Middle Ages. He did research about it in the years 1946-1951, increasing his number of meetings and document retrievals, until finally he produced a prototype based on his personal designs. At the age of sixty three, he brought ambition, passion and perfectionism to this work which began in April, 1952 which lasted a year. Fifteen years of work allowed him to create a \\"perfect and magical harp\\" according to his son, realizing his dream in the early 1950s. He created, in April 1953, \\"Telenn gentañ\\", a harp model equipped with nylon strings. This work was the outcome of much research and calculation. The sound of this harp, as well as the various performances and the recitals by his son Alan, created an enthusiasm for the harp which caused the revival of the instrument in Brittany in the 1950s. In 1959, he harmonized and arranged the pieces of Alan's first record. He produced about twenty copies which in the Celtic circles of Saint-Malo, Pontivy, Redon. In 1964, he created an instrument inspired by the 15th or 16th century Irish harp, fitted with metallic strings which gave him a tone similar to the twelve-stringed guitar or zither. Jord died on December 20, 1974 in Saint-Mandé (Val-de- Marne). In 1976, Alan dedicated his album Trema'n Inis (\\"Towards the island\\") to Georges. His wife died on September 26, 2005 in Limeil-Brévannes (Val-de- Marne) at the age of 102. Alan paid tribute to her with the song \\"Over there, over there\\" on the album Explores in 2006. Both rest in the cemetery of Gourin, following the wishes of Georges.
