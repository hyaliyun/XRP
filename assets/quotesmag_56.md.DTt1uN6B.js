He was seriously injured by an IRA car bomb in 1981, in which he lost his right leg. He was styled as the 10th Baronet of Stichill from 1961 to 2016, when a court accepted DNA evidence that established he was not the biological grandson of the 8th baronet. His cousin Murray Pringle inherited the baronetcy instead of Sir Steuart's eldest son and expected heir. Early life and education Pringle was born in Dover on 21 July 1928, the only child of Sir Norman Hamilton Pringle of Stichill, 9th Baronet (1903‚Äì1961), and his first wife, Winifred Olive Curran (died 1975). He was educated at Sherborne School. Military career Pringle joined the Royal Marines in 1946. He was appointed commanding officer of 45 Commando in 1971 and, after a tour at Headquarters Commando Forces from 1974 in which role he was promoted from lieutenant colonel to colonel, he became Major General Commando Forces in 1978.Clan Pringle, clanpringle.org.uk.

One of the first questions he asked was, \\"How's my dog?\\" His dog, Bella, was unscathed but Pringle lost his right leg in the incident and badly injured his left.\\"Once More, Terror in the Streets\\", Time. Retrieved 22 January 2018. As Commandant General of the Royal Marines, he was seen welcoming the Commandos home following the Falklands War.Britain's Small Wars , britains-smallwars.com. Retrieved 22 January 2018. He was named BBC Pebble Mill Man of the Year for his \\"outstanding achievement and bravery\\". He later returned to duties, and retired in 1985. Later life In retirement he became chairman and Chief Executive of the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust. Honours Pringle was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1982 Birthday Honours. Pringle was awarded an Honorary DSc of City University London in 1982 and an Honorary LLD of Exeter University in 1994. He was also an Honorary Admiral of the Texas Navy. Personal life In 1953, Sir Steuart married Jacqueline Marie Gladwell, only daughter of Wilfrid Hubert Gladwell. They had two sons, Simon Robert and Julian Andrew James, and two daughters, Shelagh Mary Frances and Nicola Ann. His eldest son had been the heir apparent to the baronetcy. =DNA case= Both Norman Hamilton Pringle and his son Sir Steuart were recognised as the 9th and 10th Pringle Baronets of Nova Scotia, respectively, during their lifetimes; however, questions had existed in the family about whether Norman Hamilton was the actual biological child of Sir Norman Robert Pringle, 8th Baronet (1871‚Äì1919). The 8th Baronet had married Florence Madge Vaughan on 16 October 1902, but only seven months later, she gave birth to a son, Norman Hamilton, on 13 May 1903, leading to questions of legitimacy that were not resolved until more than a century later. In 2009, Sir Steuart agreed to DNA testing for a project launched by his first cousin Murray Pringle (born 3 August 1941), an accountant who was attempting to restore a clan chief to Clan Pringle, which has been an armigerous clan since 1737. The results indicated that Sir Steuart's paternal DNA was not consistent with that of other Pringles, but Murray Pringle heeded advice that the issue of the legitimate claimant to the baronetcy should not be contested during Sir Steuart's lifetime. After he died in 2013, both Simon Pringle (Sir Steuart's eldest son) and Murray Pringle attempted to claim the baronetcy. In 2016, a court agreed Murray Pringle was the rightful heir to the baronetcy instead of his second cousin Simon Pringle, as DNA evidence demonstrated that Sir Steuart's father was not the biological son of Sir Norman Pringle, 8th Baronet. Sir Norman Robert Pringle, 8th Baronet had three sons: Norman Hamilton (1903‚Äì1961), Ronald Steuart (1905‚Äì1968; Murray Pringle's father), and James Drummond (1906‚Äì1960), but Norman Hamilton was proven with a \\"high degree of probability\\" to be fathered by someone outside the Pringle clan, and Sir Steuart and his father were removed posthumously from the Official Roll of the Baronetage. Murray Pringle was declared the 10th Baronet and his father the de jure 9th Baronet. However, as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, Sir Steuart is still styled as Sir.

The Krimml Waterfalls (), with a total height of 380 metres (1,247 feet), are the highest waterfall in Austria. The falls are on the Krimmler Ache river and are located near the village of Krimml in the High Tauern National Park in Salzburg state. Falls Part of the Krimml Waterfalls. Krimmler Waterfalls is a tiered waterfall. The waterfall begins at the top of the Krimmler Ache valley, and plunges downward in three stages. The upper stage has a drop of 140 metres, the middle of 100 metres, and the lowest a drop of 140 metres. The highest point of the waterfall is 1,470 metres above sea level. Flow The Krimmler Ache is a glacial stream whose flow varies greatly with season. Its volumetric flow in June and July is 20,000 m3/h (about 5.28 million gallons per hour), while in February it is only 500 m3/h (about 0.13 million gallons per hour). The greatest measured flow was on 25 August 1987, when it was 600,000 m3/h, or almost 160 million gallons per hour. After the falls, the river joins the Salzach, which flows to the Inn, then into the River Danube and finally to the Black Sea. Tourism To ensure that tourists could see more of the waterfall without difficulty, Ignaz von K√ºrsinger, from Mittersill, created a path to the upper part of the waterfall. In 1879, the Austrian Alpine Club improved the road to provide a more panoramic view. About 400,000 people visit the falls annually. The misty spray of the waterfall creates ideal growth condition for hundreds of mosses, lichens and ferns. The surroundings are the habitat for 62 bird species.Krimmler Wasserf√§lle, leaflet obtainable at the Krimml Tourist information There is a negative impact on the local residents due to the high traffic level in a small village, and because of erosion to the road.

Opala, OR (born August 4, 1950) is an American historian noted for establishing the \\"Gullah Connection,\\" the historical links between the indigenous people of the West African nation of Sierra Leone and the Gullah people of the Low Country region of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States. Opala's historical research began with a study of Bunce Island, the British slave castle in Sierra Leone that was a departure point for many African slaves shipped to South Carolina and Georgia in the mid- and late 18th century Middle Passage. He was the first scholar to recognize that Bunce Island has greater importance for the Gullah than any other West African slave castle. He ranks it as \\"the most important historic site in Africa for the United States.\\"Bunce Island: A British Slave Castle in Sierra Leone, exhibit website Opala has traveled between Sierra Leone and the South Carolina and Georgia Low Country for 30 years, producing documentary films, museum exhibits, and popular publications on this historical connection. He is best known for a series of \\"Gullah Homecomings\\" in which Gullah people traveled to Sierra Leone to explore their historical and family ties to that country. He has drawn on his original research to establish these connections, and the work of earlier scholars, especially Lorenzo Dow Turner, an African-American linguist who in the 1930s and 1940s traced many elements of Gullah speech to West African languages. Opala's research and public history events generated a national dialog in Sierra Leone on the subject of family lost in the Atlantic slave trade. These discussions have continued for almost three decades. The Sierra Leone media first coined the phrase, \\"Gullah Connection,\\" for the family ties which Opala has brought to light.Bernadette Cole, \\"The Gullah Connection\\" (interview with Joseph Opala), West Africa magazine, 19 May 1986 He helped generate a similar dialog in the South Carolina and Georgia Low Country, where he has given public lectures and interviews to the local media, and organized workshops for teachers and cultural activists for many years. His work has helped Gullahs recognize their links to African traditions.Jane Fishman, \\"Childhood Folk Song Traces Woman's Roots\\", Spartanburg Herald- Journal, 24 Nov. 1991 Opala's efforts to bring Sierra Leoneans and Gullahs together through an exploration of their common history have been recognized in both countries. In 2012, Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma awarded Opala the Order of the Rokel, that country's version of the British knighthood,\\"Professor Joseph Opala Honored in the 2012 National Honors, Insignia and Awards Ceremony\\" Cocorioko May 31, 2012\\"Sierra Leone's President Koroma Awards Professor Joseph Opala for Bunce Island Project\\" African Diaspora Tourism website and Sierra Leone citizenship the following year.

His father Marian P. Opala (1921-2010) fought in the Polish Underground in World War II and immigrated to the U.S. in 1947. Opala's father was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp (Flossenb√ºrg) during the war, and lost all contact with his surviving family in Poland during the Cold War period that followed.\\"Marian Opala\\", Voices of Oklahoma, Oklahoma oral history archiveBob Burke & Ryan Leonard, Opala: In Faithful Service to the Law, Oklahoma Heritage Association, 2012 Opala grew up immersed in the effects of World and the separation of families.\\"Marian Peter Opala\\", Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture\\"Marian P. Opala Obituary\\", Oklahoman, 14 October 2010, at Legacy.com Later his father became an attorney and was appointed as an Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice. During high school years, Opala was an active member of the Oklahoma Anthropological Society, participating in weekend digs on prehistoric Native American sites in his home state. He spent his summers doing volunteer work in the Oklahoma Historical Society archives. During college, he took part in an archaeological dig run by the University of Wisconsin at Cahokia Mounds, a major Mississippian culture site in Illinois. He also did independent ethnographic research among the Lacandon Indians in Southern Mexico. Opala earned B.A. and M.A. degrees in anthropology at the University of Arizona and the University of Oklahoma, but later turned his attention to history. He did post-graduate study at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. Early work in Sierra Leone (1974-1979) Opala's interest in Sierra Leone began with his service in the U.S. Peace Corps from 1974 to 1977. He was assigned to a Limba village in Tonkolili District, where his job was to introduce modern rice cultivation methods derived from the Green Revolution concepts then popular. While plowing a field, Opala spotted some ancient African pottery and European trade goods, including glass beads. He realized that the area where he was working, which lay along the Rokel River, was on one of the trade routes that connected the interior and the sea coast during the Atlantic slave trade period. Opala took his discoveries to Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital city. Aided by the Peace Corps country director, he was assigned as \\"Staff Archaeologist\\" to the Sierra Leone National Museum and the Institute of African Studies at Fourah Bay College. U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels urged him to focus his efforts on Bunce Island.\\"Priscilla: A Slave Story,\\" Providence Journal, Feb. 14, 2005, by Paul Davis Anne Farrow, \\"The Scholar and the Slave Trade\\", Hartford Courant, 5 April 2005 He conducted research there under the Peace Corps's aegis through 1977, then spent another year doing further research under a grant from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities. At the time, there was little historic research published about Bunce Island, and documentation was scarce. The few Sierra Leoneans who had heard of it thought the Portuguese had built the castle.Joseph Opala, \\"Bunce Island: A British Slave Castle in Sierra Leone (Historical Summary),\\" in Bunce Island Cultural Resource Assessment by Christopher DeCorse, Sierra Leone Monuments and Relics Commission, 2007 Opala drew on history, archaeology, and oral traditions to learn more. He found historical evidence that British slave traders controlled Bunce Island during its entire history. Cutting back the vegetation and studying the ruins, he was the first scholar to identify the functions of the major buildings, including Bance Island House (the headquarters), the men's and women's slave yards, and the underground gunpowder magazine.Joseph Opala, \\"Historical Resources on Bunce Island: A Preliminary Survey,\\" Sierra Leone National Museum, December 1976 Opala interviewed the Temne elders on the neighboring islands about their oral histories related to Bunce Island. He found that the local fishermen called the island by a variant of its original name -- \\"Bence Island\\" ‚Äîand that the descendants of Bunce Island's African workers lived in a village a few miles upriver. He also discovered that for at least 250 years, the local people have associated a \\"devil\\" or nature spirit, with the \\"Devil's Rocks\\" lying off the north end of Bunce Island. They have continued long held rituals to propitiate that spirit to the present day.Robert Weller, \\"Archaeologist Becoming a Link to the Past for Blacks,\\" Associated Press, 16 January 1986 After Opala left Sierra Leone in 1979, he did archival research in the US and UK. He discovered that many of the slaves who passed through Bunce Island were shipped to South Carolina and Georgia. The rice planters in those colonies were eager to purchase captives from Sierra Leone and other parts of West Africa where they were skilled in growing rice. He also found that there were strong linguistic connections between the Gullah people, the descendants of the rice-growing slaves still living in coastal South Carolina and Georgia today, and Sierra Leone. Linguists had been pointing to those connections for years without having the historical data to explain them.Joseph A. Opala, \\"The Gullah Language\\", in The Gullah: Rice, Slavery, and the Sierra Leone-American Connection, USIS, 1987 Opala wanted to return to Sierra Leone to share this new information with its people. Public history from Sierra Leone (1985-1997) Soon after returning to Sierra Leone, Opala gave a well- publicized lecture on Bunce Island and that country's connection to the Gullah people at the US Embassy. Sierra Leoneans were delighted to learn about the group of African Americans, descendants of ancestors from their region, who had retained cultural traits and food dishes similar to theirs and a language related to their Krio language. Opala had many media requests for interviews, and people soon began to stop him on the street to ask about their Gullah \\"cousins.\\" Inspired by the popular reaction, Opala developed a series of public history initiatives that focused on Bunce Island and the \\"Gullah Connection\\" to the United States. These included public lectures, radio interviews, film shows and newspaper articles, and workshops for teachers and students. But his most successful effort was the \\"Gullah Homecoming\\" he organized in 1989 for a group of Gullah community leaders who wanted to see Sierra Leone for themselves. Their arrival galvanized the attention of the entire nation. The local media followed the visitors' every move during their week in Sierra Leone.Anne Farrow, \\"The Scholar and the Slave Trade\\" Hartford Courant, April 3, 2005 Opala lectured in the Institute of African Studies at Sierra Leone's Fourah Bay College (FBC) from 1985 to 1992, using his academic base to advance his Gullah Connection work. He acted as an adviser on cultural policy to President Joseph Saidu Momoh and the U.S. Ambassadors who served in Sierra Leone at that time. He also established a relationship with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS), and during his trips back to the US, he convinced NPS officials to send an expert team to survey Bunce Island in 1989. After seeing the castle, one of the NPS experts said he had \\"never seen an historic site so important for the United States in such desperate need of preservation.\\"Recommendations for the Protection and Management of Bunce Island National Historic Site, Sierra Leone by David Reynolds, David Ates, & Daniel Murphy, US National Park Service report, 1989 Later, Opala helped persuade Herb Cables, then Deputy Director of NPS, to see Bunce Island for himself. Cables arrived in April 1992 with a pledge of $5 million for Bunce Island's preservation. That same month, Opala took Colin Powell to Bunce Island, and after seeing it, Powell was deeply moved. He later described the experience in his autobiography, My American Journey. He said: \\"I am an American...But today, I am something more..I am an African too...I feel my roots here in this continent.\\"Colin Powell, My American Journey, pp. 533‚Äì534. But a military coup that occurred soon after Cables and Powell's visit interrupted work on the project, as the new NPRC military government had no interest in it.For more on Opala's experience of the 1992 NPRC coup, see: \\"The Vagabond King\\" by Simon Akam, New Statesman, Feb. 2, 2012 After the Sierra Leone Civil War erupted, Opala joined with two Sierra Leonean human rights activists, Zainab Bangura and Julius Spencer, to establish the Campaign for Good Governance (CGG).Joseph Opala, \\"Why Sierra Leone is Important\\", Crosslines Global Report, Sept/Oct 1999 CGG worked with other civil society groups to promote a democratic election to unseat the military junta. During the run-up to Sierra Leone's 1996 election, CGG encouraged citizens to vote. When the election was held, thousands took to the streets to confront the soldiers who were trying to create chaos at the polls.\\"Pro-Democracy Leader Zainab Bangura,\\" National Public Radio, 23 May 2000 CGG developed as Sierra Leone's most prominent civil society group. But, the following year, RUF \\"rebels\\" and renegade soldiers took over the capital city and targeted leaders of the pro-democracy movement. Opala and his CGG colleagues were forced to leave the country.\\"Anthropologist Joseph Opala Lived in Sierra Leone for the past 23 Years\\" National Public Radio, Fresh Air Program, July 8, 1997 \\"Sierra Leone on Edge after Military Coup,\\" Los Angeles Times (AP story), May 27, 1997 \\"Nigerians Fire on Rebels who Seized Sierra Leone,\\" by Howard W. French, New York Times, June 3, 1997 Public history from the Gullah region (1997 to 1999) After returning to the US, Opala served for two years as the Scholar in Residence at Penn Center, the foremost Gullah community organization, based on St. Helena Island, South Carolina. Opala worked with Emory Campbell, Penn Center's director, and the US Park Service on the early planning stage of what ultimately became the Gullah-Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor,\\"Park Service Wants to Spread Word about Gullah History\\" by Herb Frazier, Charleston Post & Courier (South Carolina), August 30, 1997\\"Local Site to be Center of National Exhibit on Gullah\\" by Herb Frazier, Charleston Post & Courier (South Carolina), March 11, 1998 a national heritage area covering the entire Gullah region, including the coastal plain and sea islands of South Carolina and Georgia, and adjoining parts of coastal North Carolina and Florida. The Corridor was established by Congress in 2006, and will ultimately embrace a wide range of public history initiatives to celebrate Gullah history and culture. Opala organized workshops at Penn Center on the Sierra Leone-Gullah Connection for local teachers and cultural activists. He also lectured on the Gullahs' links to Sierra Leone at colleges, museums, and community centers in the Low Country. He brought several Sierra Leonean social activists to Penn Center, as well, who talked about their country's civil war and encouraged the Gullahs, as U.S. citizens, to speak out on behalf of their African cousins. Later, he helped arrange for Gullah families on St. Helena Island to care for the children of Sierra Leonean war refugees granted asylum in the U.S. while their parents settled their affairs in their new home. Thus, a relationship that had been merely historical was now becoming a reality in the world today. Opala also helped organize several reunions between the Gullahs and their Black Seminole cousins in Oklahoma, Texas, and Northern Mexico. Penn Center symposium topic, 1998, \\"The Black Seminoles: Gullah Pioneer Freedom Fighters\\"\\"Black Seminole Observances at the Grave of Osceola, Fort Moultrie, South Carolina,\\" November 15, 1998 The Black Seminoles are the descendants of Gullah slaves who escaped into Spanish Florida in the 1700s, where they allied with the Seminole Indians. After the Second Seminole War in the 1830s, the Black Seminoles were removed to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Some later migrated to Texas and Northern Mexico, where their descendants still retain Gullah language and customs to the present day. Opala organized a symposium at Penn Center that brought Black Seminole leaders to the Gullah region for the first time,\\"Black Seminoles: Gullahs Who Escaped From Slavery\\" by Joseph Opala Gilder Lerner Center, Yale University website, 2007 and he helped organize return visits by Gullah leaders to Black Seminole communities in Oklahoma and Texas. Opala later submitted a report to the US Park Service suggesting ways to incorporate Bunce Island and Black Seminole historic sites into the Gullah- Geechee Corridor in the future.See: The Gullah Connection Trail: A Proposal for the US National Park Service Public history from the United States (1999 to 2010) Opala taught at James Madison University (JMU) in Virginia from 1999 to 2010, using his academic position, whenever possible, to advance his \\"Gullah Connection\\" work. In 2003, he and his students organized a \\"Gullah Film Festival\\" at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. In 2004 he was a fellow at Yale University's Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition (GLC). Working with GLC, he organized the \\"National Summit on Bunce Island\\" at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs in Washington, DC. The Summit brought together State Department, Smithsonian and National Park Service officials; Congressional staff; and Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the U.S. for an all-day briefing on Bunce Island's importance for both nations. The following year, Opala was a fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Germany, where he shared his work with international scholars. Opala organized Priscilla's Homecoming to Sierra Leone in 2005, and the following year, curated an exhibit, called \\"Finding Priscilla's Children,\\" at the New-York Historical Society that later traveled to museums in South Carolina. Priscilla's Homecoming was led by an African American woman whose family can trace their ancestry to an enslaved child, later called \\"Priscilla,\\" who was taken from Sierra Leone to South Carolina in the year 1756, using a uniquely unbroken chain of documents (see: \\"Gullah Homecomings\\" below). Opala worked with the Africana Heritage Project at the University of South Florida that produced an online database that will enable thousands of other African Americans to link their own family histories to Priscilla. In 2007, Opala helped establish the \\"Bunce Island Coalition (US)\\" at a meeting in Washington, DC attended by two former U.S. Ambassadors to Sierra Leone, prominent Sierra Leoneans living in the US, Gullah community leaders, and former Peace Corps volunteers. BIC (US) was established as a non-profit group to raise funds to preserve Bunce Island through a publicity campaign. The following year, Opala and his JMU students developed an exhibit on Bunce Island that went to universities, museums, and libraries all across the US, including the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The exhibit is now on permanent display in the Sierra Leone National Museum. In 2010, a wealthy private donor pledged $5 million for the project, and Opala went to Sierra Leone right away to act as the project coordinator. Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma agreed to a televised meeting with the project team in November 2010 to signal his support.Patriotic Vanguard (Freetown) newspaper, 13 August 2010 Sierra Leone-Gullah Connection The Gullahs live in the Low Country region of South Carolina and Georgia on the coastal plain and the long chain of Sea Islands that runs parallel to the coast. They are well known for having preserved more of their African cultural heritage than any other black community in the US, including a creole language that contains strong African influences. They also have a cuisine, storytelling, music, religious beliefs, spiritual practices, herbal medicines, handicrafts, etc. that exhibit strong African influences. The Gullahs' history can be understood in large measure through one important factor ‚Äî rice farming. Rice was the staple crop in South Carolina and Georgia in the colonial period, and Low Country planters preferred African captives from what they called the \\"Rice Coast\\" because of their skill at cultivating that difficult crop. By \\"Rice Coast,\\" Low Country planters meant the traditional rice-growing region of West Africa that extended about 700 miles from what are now Senegal, Gambia and Guinea Bissau in the north down to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in the south. African farmers had been cultivating rice in that region for centuries, and had developed methods to grow that crop in every new environment they pioneered long before European contact. Peter Wood and other scholars have shown that Rice Coast Africans contributed greatly to the success of the rice industry in early South Carolina and Georgia. Slave auction ads of the period in the Charleston and Savannah newspapers often mentioned the origin of the slaves in areas where Africans were known to cultivate rice: the \\"Rice Coast,\\" \\"Gambia,\\" \\"Seralion,\\" and \\"Windward Coast.\\" Some ads stated that the enslaved Africans were \\"well acquainted with the culture of rice,\\" and some referred specifically to \\"Bance Island.\\"Notice in the South Carolina Gazette 1760, of a slave auction aboard the ship \\"Bance Island\\" that brought captives from the \\"Rice Coast\\" of Africa, New York Public Library, Digital Collections Peter Wood has pointed to the Rice Coast region, in general, as important for Gullah origins, while Daniel LittlefieldRice and Slaves: Ethnicity and the Slave Trade in Colonial South Carolina, by Daniel C. Littlefield, University of Illinois Press, 1991 has pointed to influences from the Senegambia region on the north end of the Rice Coast. But Opala has long argued that while the Gullahs have links to the Rice Coast as a whole, their connection to Sierra Leone is uniquely strong.The Gullah: Rice, Slavery, and the Sierra Leone- American Connection by Joseph A. Opala, USIS, 1987 He points out that Bunce Island was the largest British slaving operation in the Rice Coast area, and that Africans were not just taken from Sierra Leone to the Gullah region, some Gullahs also returned to Sierra Leone after a period of time, thereby giving rise to influences in both directions. Two-way connection Some free Gullah people, known as \\"Black Loyalists,\\" migrated to Sierra Leone after American Independence. They were originally slaves on South Carolina and Georgia plantations who escaped to the British lines during the American Revolutionary War. The British promised them freedom in return for military service, but after they lost the war, the British resettled them in Nova Scotia, Canada. Later, British philanthropists established a colony for freed slaves in Sierra Leone, and arranged transportation for nearly 1,200 Black Loyalists from Canada to Sierra Leone in 1792.James Brooke, \\"Birchtown Journal; For Nova Scotia Blacks, Veil Is Ripped From Past\\", New York Times, Oct. 8, 1999, accessed 26 Mar 2010 Opala maintains that about a quarter of the Black Loyalists (or \\"Nova Scotians\\" as they were called in Sierra Leone today) were originally Gullahs from South Carolina and Georgia. Some Gullahs also migrated directly from the United States to Sierra Leone in the early 1800s, including Edward Jones, a free black man from South Carolina. Jones became the first principal of Sierra Leone's Fourah Bay College. This two-way connection means that many Sierra Leoneans have family ties to the Gullahs in South Carolina and Georgia. People from Sierra Leone's indigenous tribes ‚Äî the Mende, Temne, Limba, etc. ‚Äî were transported as slaves to the rice plantations in the Low Country. But some of the Nova Scotian migrants who went to Sierra Leone later on were Gullahs, and some had actually been born in Sierra Leone. The descendants of these migrants, who live in Freetown, the capital city, are known as the Creoles (or Krios). So, both Sierra Leone's indigenous peoples and the Krios can claim family ties to the Gullahs. In 2011, Kevin Lowther, another former Peace Corps Volunteer who served in Sierra Leone, published a groundbreaking biography of John Kizell, a man of the Sherbro tribe of Sierra Leone who was transported to slavery in South Carolina. Kizell completed the full circle, escaping slavery in Charleston, serving with the British Army during the Revolutionary War, taking part in the evacuation of black troops to Nova Scotia, and then returning to Sierra Leone with the \\"Nova Scotian\\" settlers in 1792. Opala's foreword to the book calls attention to this two-way connection between Sierra Leoneans and Gullahs exemplified by Kizell's long and eventful life. Three Gullah Homecomings Opala is best known for the series of \\"homecomings\\" he organized, starting in 1988 with a visit by Sierra Leone's President Joseph Saidu Momoh to the Gullah community on St. Helena Island, South Carolina. National Public Radio called that event the \\"Gullah Reunion.\\" He later organized three homecoming visits for Gullahs returning to Sierra Leone, each based on new and more specific information Opala and other scholars had discovered on the links between Sierra Leoneans and the Gullahs. He organized these events in collaboration with the Sierra Leone Government, the U.S. Embassy in Sierra Leone, and Gullah community leaders in the U.S. He also helped produce the documentary films that chronicle the first two homecomings: Family Across the Sea (1991) and The Language You Cry In (1998). These videos generated a good deal of public discussion in both countries on family lost in the slave trade; and after seeing them, some Sierra Leoneans and African Americans traveled across the Atlantic on their own to renew lost family ties. These documentaries also highlight the role of Bunce Island in the slave trade links between Sierra Leone and the US.For more on Opala's role in the Gullah homecomings, see: Wilbur Cross, Gullah Culture in America (2008) Gullah Homecoming (1989) -- The first homecoming was led by Emory Campbell, Director of Penn Center, the foremost Gullah community organization, and it included Gullah community leaders and cultural activists. The Gullahs had learned of Opala's research on the slave trade links between Sierra Leone and South Carolina and Georgia, and they wanted to see Sierra Leone for themselves. The visitors were hosted by Sierra Leone's president on a state visit; they toured traditional African rice fields; and they paid a poignant visit to Bunce Island. The documentary Family Across the Sea ‚Äî made by South Carolina Public Television ‚Äî documents this historic homecoming and President Momoh's groundbreaking visit to South Carolina the year before.Review of \\"Family Across the Sea\\" Video Rating Guide, UC Berkeley Library Moran Family Homecoming (1997) -- Opala and ethnomusicologist Cynthia Schmidt located a Gullah family in coastal Georgia that has preserved a song in the Mende language of Sierra Leone for over 200 years. The 5-line song, an ancient funeral hymn, is likely the longest text in an African language known to have been preserved by a black family in the US.The Language You Cry In California Newsreel website The song was first recorded by African American linguist Lorenzo Dow Turner in 1931. Opala and Schmidt found that the Georgia family still remembered the song when they met them in 1990; and later, working with Sierra Leonean linguist Tazieff Koroma, they found a Mende woman living in a remote rural area of southern Sierra Leone whose family has preserved a similar song. The melodies of the songs are different, but the lyrics are very similar; and the Mende woman sang along with Turner's original recording the moment she heard it. Opala worked with the Sierra Leone Government to arrange the Moran family's homecoming, and helped produce the documentary film The Language You Cry In that chronicles this remarkable story. INKO Productions website Review of \\"The Language You Cry In\\" by Jack David Eller, Anthropology Review Database Priscilla's Homecoming (2005) -- Opala organized a homecoming for Thomalind Polite, a young Gullah woman whose family is linked to Sierra Leone by an unbroken 250-year document trail.\\"A WORLD AWAY: Historian Connects African Nation to Gullah Community through a Slave Girl Named Priscilla,\\" Times & Democrat, Orangeburg, SC, Nov. 9, 2008 Records show that Polite is the direct descendant of a 10-year-old enslaved girl, later called \\"Priscilla\\", who was taken from Sierra Leone to Charleston, South Carolina in 1756.Exhibit Traces Slave‚Äôs Still-Growing Family Tree: 249-Year-Old Paper Trail of Records Stretches from 1756 to the Modern-Day, Associated Press, Dec. 16, 2005 Polite's family history was first researched by writer Edward Ball, and included in his prize-winning book Slaves in the Family (1998). Ball documented the family's history through detailed plantation records that reveal Priscilla's descendants in America for eight generations.Hillary Mayell, \\"Slave Girl's Story Revealed Through Rare Records\\", National Geographic News, 8 Jun 2005, accessed 27 Mar 2010 Opala completed the story when he found the records of the slave ship Hare, that brought Priscilla from Sierra Leone to Charleston, and the slave auction accounts that record her sale to a South Carolina rice planter. Opala developed a website on \\"Priscilla's Homecoming\\", maintained by Yale University.\\"Priscilla's Homecoming\\" website Gilder Lehrman Center, Yale University, accessed 27 Mar 2010 He also curated an exhibit at the New-York Historical Society called, Finding Priscilla's Children: The Roots and Branches of Slavery (2006).\\"Links Among Generations, First Forged in Chains\\", New York Times, January 13, 2006\\"Exhibit Traces Slaves' Still Growing Family Tree\\", Associated Press, Nov. 16, 2005 Bunce Island preservation project (2010 to 2013) In 2010, Opala announced the start of a $5 million project to preserve Bunce Island. He was then director of a non-profit called the Bunce Island Coalition (US), whose goal is to halt the erosion that threatens the island, stabilize the ruins, and construct a modern historic park. His group also wants to build a museum in Freetown devoted to Bunce Island's history and its impact in both Sierra Leone and the Americas. The museum will feature Sierra Leone's connections to the Gullahs and other African diaspora communities. After signing a memorandum of understanding with the Sierra Leone Government in July 2010, the Coalition began overseeing a series of scientific studies leading to a full-blown preservation project.\\"Sierra Leone: U.S. $5 Million Bunce Island Project to be Launched\\", Concord Times (Freetown),2 November 2010\\"US-Funded Coalition Restores Key West African Slave-Trade 'Castle, Christian Science Monitor, 5 August 2011 Two highly qualified experts joined the project ‚Äî archaeologist Christopher DeCorse of Syracuse University, known for his seminal research on Ghana's Elmina Castle and Michael Schuller, president of a US-based engineering firm that carries out historic preservation projects all over the world.Project will preserve slave-trading fort in Sierra Leone, by Paul Davis, Providence Journal, Rhode Island, Nov. 8, 2010 \\"US-funded coalition restores key West African slave-trade 'castle, by Paige McClanahan, Christian Science Monitor, Aug. 5, 2011 The Bunce Island project quickly gained international attention, and in October 2011 Opala guided Britain's Princess Anne through the ruins.Visit to Sierra Leone of Her Royal Highness, The Princess Royal, Oct. 22, 2011 For a Sierra Leonean view of the Bunce Island project, see: \\"How Sierra Leone Plans To Use Slavery Legacy To Boost Tourism (The Forgotten Island)\\" in This is Sierra Leone, July 3, 2012 In 2013, Opala handed the project over to his Sierra Leonean colleagues in the Bunce Island Coalition, though he continues to serve as the group's historical adviser. Opala and computer artist Gary Chatelain of James Madison University are now working on a 3-D computer model of Bunce Island showing how the castle appeared in the year 1805. African American TV actor Isaiah Washington, who traced his ancestors to Sierra Leone through a DNA test, donated $25,000 to the project in 2007.\\"Isaiah Washington Donates to Slavery Project\\", March 14, 2007, \\"CBS Entertainment\\" website Opala and Chatelain's computer model will be used to explain the castle to visitors at both the museum and the site itself. The computer model is also featured in a traveling exhibit on Bunce Island that Opala created. The exhibit has gone to colleges and museums in the U.S. and Canada, and to the Sierra Leone National Museum during that country's 50th anniversary of Independence celebrations in 2011. Popular and scholarly impact The homecomings Opala organized focused national attention on the Gullah Connection in Sierra Leone, and the people of that country responded with enthusiasm. When the first Gullah group made a pilgrimage to Bunce Island in 1989, hundreds of people came in boats and canoes to witness the historic occasion. Today, the \\"Gullah Connection\\" is an \\"evergreen\\" story in the Sierra Leone media, and local newspapers frequently carry stories on the Gullah and their African roots that appear in the American papers. Most Sierra Leoneans are now aware of their historical links to the Gullahs. Sierra Leone's high school history textbook covers the Gullah Connection,A New History of Sierra Leone by Joe A.D. Alie, Macmillon, 1990 (pp. 36-37) and several local civic groups are dedicated to nurturing their country's family ties to the Gullahs.\\"Gullah Cousin Contacts Kin\\" by Herb Frazier, Charleston Post & Courier, November 9, 1995 The \\"Gullah homecomings\\" also generated extensive publicity in South Carolina and Georgia. The documentary films based on those events have been broadcast repeatedly on local TV and shown in schools and colleges in those states, and many Gullahs have now visited Sierra Leone. In 1995 the Coastal Georgia Historical Society produced a traveling exhibit, called \\"Trans-Atlantic Linkage: The Gullah/Geechee-Sierra Leone Connection,\\" in partnership with the Sierra Leone National Museum. During Sierra Leone's civil war, Gullah civic leaders lobbied the U.S. Congress, asking for help for their \\"ancestral homeland\\". Sierra Leonean immigrants in the U.S. have also taken a strong interest in the Gullah Connection, forming an organization called the \\"Sierra Leone-Gullah Heritage Association\\" to nurture their family ties to the Gullahs.Sierra Leone-Gullah Heritage Association (overview) Sierra Leoneans and Gullahs now come together frequently at cultural festivals in the Low Country. African Americans, in general, have taken a good deal of interest in the Mende song from Sierra Leone preserved by the Gullah family in coastal Georgia. The Smithsonian's Anacostia Museum produced an exhibit on Lorenzo Dow Turner in 2010 that included a section on the Mende song. An inspirational book, called the African American Book of Values, features the story of the ancient song. Musicians in Charleston created a jazz version of the Mende song, playing it in local concerts.\\"Signs Showing Local Jazz Scene Doing Just Fine,\\" by Jack McCray, Charleston Post & Courier, July 8, 2010 And a musical play, called Black Pearl Sings! based partly on the documentary The Language You Cry In‚Äîand including a dramatic performance of the Mende song at the end of the play‚Äîhas met with enthusiastic audiences in repertory theaters all across the country.\\"Black Pearl's Author Frank Higgins\\" (interview), DC Theater Scene.com, October 7, 2009 Merrimack Repertory Theatre (Lowell, Massachusetts) website -- background info for Black Pearl Sings!Birmingham Festival Theatre (Alabama), production of Black Pearl Sings! But Opala's most enduring contribution is, no doubt, his discovery of Bunce Island's historical importance for the United States, and his decades of research and public history work to promote popular understanding of that site. Bunce Island will likely become a major destination for African American heritage tourism in the coming years due largely to his efforts.For more on Opala's view of Bunce Island's importance for U.S. history, see his essay in the website \\"Visit Sierra Leone\\". But Opala has also encouraged other scholars to take interest in Bunce Island, and more and more have turned their attention to that site. Professor Henry Louis Gates, the well-known authority on African American studies, recently featured Bunce Island in his new TV documentary on the history of African Americans, broadcast on PBS. Gates also featured in the same video the story of \\"Priscilla,\\" the enslaved child taken from Sierra Leone to South Carolina in 1756.\\"Sierra Leone, not Goree Island or Elmina Castle is Star of US Television Documentary\\" by Hadi Bah Sierra Leone 365 website (n.d.)The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross, Episode One: The Black Atlantic: 1500 -- 1800 official website Opala's claim that Bunce Island has special importance for the United States appears to be gradually gaining acceptance.\\"Bunce Island: A British Slave Castle in Sierra Leone,\\" exhibit website Honors * Sierra Leone: Order of the Rokel (2012)  References  External links (biography & awards) *\\"Professor Joseph Opala Honored\\" Sierra Leone's 2012 National Honors ceremony, Cocorioko May 31, 2012 *\\"Citation\\" from Sierra Leone's president African Diaspora Tourism website *Opala granted Sierra Leone citizenship Sierra Leone Express Media, Dec. 13, 2013 * Opala Inducted into the 1862 Circle The Island News, May 9, 2013 * \\"Penn Center Honors Local, Cultural Leaders\\" Beaufort Gazette, May 18, 2013 *\\"Former JMU Prof Continues Groundbreaking Research into Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade\\" Old South High website *, James Madison University (scroll down) *, Hartford Courant External links (written sources) *The Gullah: Rice, Slavery and the Sierra Leone--American Connection, Gilder Lehrman Center, Yale University *The Language You Cry In‚ÄîSummary description, California Newsreel *‚ÄîSummary description, Inko Productions * \\"Priscilla: The Story of an African Slave\\", BBC News, New York, 23 November 2005 * \\"Priscilla's Homecoming\\" Website, Gilder Lehrman Center, Yale University *\\"Priscilla's Homecoming\\" USF Africana Heritage Project *, Providence Journal *Bunce Island preservation project, Christian Science Monitor *\\"Sierra Leone Moves into Slave Tourism\\" BBC News, June 28, 2012 External links (video & audio) *Family Across the Sea‚ÄîFolkstreams Full-length video online *The Language You Cry In‚ÄîFolkstreams Full-length video online *Radio Interview on Priscilla's Homecoming With Good Reason October 14, 2006 * broadcast by SLBC TV, April 27, 2012 *Tour of Bunce Island for MSNBC MSNBC's Rock Center, broadcast February 15, 2012 * Tour of Bunce Island for CNN CNN's Inside Africa, \\"Slave Trade Ghost Town,\\" May 16, 2013 (see text and video) 1950 births Living people Alumni of SOAS University of London American anthropologists American educators American people of Polish descent Order of the Rokel (Sierra Leone) Peace Corps volunteers Writers from Oklahoma City ","title":"Joseph Opala"},{"id":"14346212","text":"{ +Trouvadore } Trouvadore was a Spanish slave ship that was shipwrecked in 1841 near East Caicos in the course of a run transporting Africans to be illegally sold to the sugarcane plantations in Cuba. As the United Kingdom had a treaty with Spain prohibiting the international slave trade and had abolished slavery in its colonies in 1833, it freed the 192 slaves who survived the wreck. Individuals and families, a total of 168 Africans, were placed with salt proprietors for apprenticeships in the Turks and Caicos Islands; the remaining 24 Africans were settled in Nassau.  Voyage of Trouvadore  Slave trading was illegal in Spain, as the country had outlawed the slave trade and had a treaty with the United Kingdom to that effect. However, governors in Cuba often turned a blind eye to the trade, as they believed slave labour was integral to the profitability of the sugarcane plantations producing their most important commodity crop. The exact route of Trouvadore is not known, but the records state that new crew members were picked up in S√£o Tom√©, a Portuguese colony off the coast of Africa that still legally traded enslaved Africans. The exact number of Africans loaded onto Trouvadore is not recorded but would have been around 280-300. When the ship wrecked off East Caicos in March 1841, all the 20 crew members and 193 Africans aboard survived. This suggested that around 100 slaves had died during the Atlantic crossing, a typical loss for a venture of this kind. At East Caicos, a number of the Africans fled into the bush; one of the crew shot a woman dead. As the United Kingdom had abolished slavery in its West Indies colonies effective 1834, the colony residents knew that the Africans should be freed. In 1841 East Caicos was a large deserted island. Residents from the neighbouring island of Middle Caicos gave the first assistance to the crew and Africans, and notified authorities on Grand Turk Island, the political capital of the Turks and Caicos. The authorities dispatched British soldiers to secure the crew and bring all the survivors back to Grand Turk whilst a decision was made on the Africans' future. Residents from Middle Caicos had disarmed the Spanish crew before the arrival of Lt. Fitzgerald with his men; he arrested them without need for force. On Grand Turk, the ship's crew were placed under armed guard; they were eventually taken to Nassau where they were given to the custody of the Cuban consul, who took them to Cuba for prosecution. Authorities placed 168 Africans with local salt proprietors. Adults and older children were put into a one-year apprenticeship to learn to process salt, nearly the only source of work on the island. All the Africans were baptised and taught English. As these 168 individuals increased the small colonial population by 7%, they strongly influenced the developing society and culture, adding a level of renewed Africanization. Descendants of these free Africans have formed a large part of the Turks and Caicos population.  Modern interest in Trouvadore  This story was long forgotten until Grethe Seim, the founder of the Turks and Caicos National Museum in 1991, and Dr Donald Keith started searching in the USA for objects from the Turks and Caicos. On a visit to the Smithsonian, they discovered a 19th-century letter book written by Grand Turk resident George Judson Gibbs, containing letters he had written in the late 1870s while trying to sell some of his artifacts to the institution. His pieces included two 'African Idols' from a Spanish slaver that wrecked off East Caicos in 1841. (He sold the two works to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which identified them as kava kava dolls made only on Easter Island in the Pacific, west of the coast of Chile. Research was begun, and scholars found the account of Trouvadore in the British National Archives. Due to the state of the records, there was initially confusion of Trouvadore with Esperanza (Hope), a Portuguese slaver that had sunk in 1837 at the Caicos. Since 2000 Nigel Sadler, former director at the Turks and Caicos National Museum (2000‚Äì2006), has been one of the chief scholars to explore the story of Trouvadore and its legacy. His research has placed the story of Trouvadore into Turks and Caicos Islands history, as well as the larger context of the illegal slave trade, British military intervention in capturing slave ships and aiding the Africans liberated from the vessels, and British relations with Spanish Cuba, where economic growth fueled the demand for the importation of illegally captured Africans as slaves. Records show that regional authorities asked the local residents to send a list with the English names assigned to each African. Scholars have not yet found this register, but it would be important for identifying the free ancestors of many descendants in Turk and Caicos, and Nassau.  Search for the wreck  Marine archeologists searched for the shipwreck and artifacts during three field seasons. In 2004 a survey located a wooden wreck in the right location. In 2006 a test excavation was carried out, but no diagnostic material was found. In 2008, the third field season, a cooperative effort was made with a multi- disciplinary expedition of the United States NOAA, which was also searching for two American navy vessels, and . They had sunk in the waters of the Turks and Caicos Islands whilst on 19th-century anti-piracy/anti-slavery patrols in the Caribbean. According to a Reuters article, on 26 November 2008, marine archaeologists claimed to have found the remains of Trouvadore slave ship off the coast of the Turks and Caicos Islands. They believe that its artifacts, including hull timbers, establish it as the Spanish ship. The wreck that is thought to be Trouvadore is also known as the \\"Black Rock Wreck.\\" The team also found one of the American ships, which appears to be Chippewa, lost in 1816. Further fieldwork is planned. Historians and anthropologists are working to place Trouvadore and the liberation of its 192 Africans in the context of settlement of the Turks and Caicos, efforts by the UK to prohibit the international slave trade, and UK relations with Cuba and Spain.

He was the Captain of Calais and Treasurer of England (from 7 July 1443). Family Ralph Boteler was the youngest surviving son of Thomas Boteler of Sudeley Castle, Gloucestershire and Alice Beauchamp (d. 1443), daughter of Sir John Beauchamp of Powick, Worcestershire. Marriage Sudeley married twice. About 1418 he married commercial wealth, in the person of Elizabeth, widow of John Hende (d. 1418), late Mayor of London. She died in 1462, and in the following year he married Alice (d. 1474), daughter of John, Baron Deyncourt, and widow of William, Baron Lovel of Titchmarsh, Northamptonshire, who survived him. Lord Sudeley The Boteler's elevation to the aristocracy arose from the marriage of Ralph's grandfather, William le Boteler of Wem, to heiress Joan de Sudeley, which later led to Ralph's father succeeding to the title of Lord of Sudeley. The Barony of Sudeley was conferred upon his father by Letters Patent. The title then passed to both Ralph's elder brothers, John who died unmarried and childless in 1410, and William, who also died childless seven years later, despite being married. William's widow, Alice, would later be appointed governess of King Henry VI of England in 1424.John Ashdown-Hill, \\"Eleanor The Secret Queen\\", Page 50 The History Press, 2009 Ralph Boteler is thought to have served with King Henry V of England in France, as he was awarded grants of land there between 1420-21.

From 1443 to 1446, Ralph served as Lord High Treasurer of England. Boteler's tenure as Lord High Treasurer occurred during the Great Bullion Famine and the Great Slump in England. Descendants Sudeley left no surviving male heir from either marriage, for his son Thomas predeceased him, also without a male heir. Thomas's widow, Eleanor, was the Lady Eleanor Butler (known as the Holy Harlot), whose alleged precontract of marriage to Edward IV of England was claimed to have invalidated Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and so legitimized the usurpation of Richard III of England.

The 13 episodes tell the story from the points of view of both the drug- dealing Barksdale organization and the investigating police detail. The season was released on DVD as a five-disc boxed set under the title of The Wire: The Complete First Season on October 12, 2004 by HBO Video. Production =Crew= David Simon is the series' creator and head writer, show runner and executive producer. Alongside Simon, many of the creative team behind The Wire are alumni of Homicide and Emmy-winning miniseries The Corner. The Corner veteran, Robert F. Colesberry, was also executive producer. Colesberry is credited by the rest of the creative team as having a large creative role for a producer, and Simon credits him for achieving the show's realistic visual feel. He also had a small recurring role as Detective Ray Cole. Colesberry's wife Karen L. Thorson joined him on the production staff. A third producer on The Corner, Nina Kostroff Noble, also stayed with the production staff for The Wire rounding out the initial four-person team. Stories for the show are often co-written by Ed Burns, a former Baltimore homicide detective and public school teacher who has worked with Simon on other projects including The Corner. The writing staff includes acclaimed crime fiction novelist George P. Pelecanos from Washington, D.C. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because of the opportunity to work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez was a colleague of Simon's from The Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco Kecken, joined the writing staff and served as the script coordinator. David H. Melnick and Shamit Choksey complete the writing staff. Homicide alumnus Clark Johnson, who directed several acclaimed episodes of The Shield, directed the pilot, the second episode, and the fifth episode (Johnson later had a starring role in the fifth season). Another repeat director is Clement Virgo, who directed two episodes. Single episode directors include Ed Bianchi, Joe Chappelle, Gloria Muzio, Milƒço Manƒçevski, Brad Anderson and Steve Shill. The season finale was directed by Tim Van Patten, an Emmy winner who has worked on every season of The Sopranos. The directing has been praised for its uncomplicated and subtle style. =Cast= The major characters of the first season were divided between those on the side of the law and those involved in drug-related crime. The starring cast comprised characters from both groups. The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems overshadowed his ability. The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case. Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner. Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant, a drug addict known as Bubbles (Andre Royo). These investigators were overseen by two commanding officers more concerned with politics and their own careers than the case, Major William Rawls (John Doman) and Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison). Assistant state's attorney Rhonda Pearlman (Deirdre Lovejoy) acted as the legal liaison between the detail and the courthouse and also had a casual relationship with one of the officers. In the homicide division, Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce) was a gifted, dry-witted detective partnered with McNulty. On the other side of the investigation was Avon Barksdale's drug empire. The driven, ruthless Barksdale (Wood Harris) was aided by business-minded Stringer Bell (Idris Elba). Avon's nephew D'Angelo Barksdale (Larry Gilliard Jr.) ran some of his uncle's territory, but also possessed a guilty conscience. The first season featured several significant characters in recurring roles. Like Detective Greggs, partners Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk (Domenick Lombardozzi) and Ellis Carver (Seth Gilliam) were reassigned to the detail from the narcotics unit. The duo's initially violent nature was eventually subdued as they proved useful in grunt work, and sometimes served as comic relief for the audience. Rounding out the temporary unit were detectives Leander Sydnor (Corey Parker Robinson), Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters) and Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost). Sydnor was a rookie detective with a reputation for solid undercover work. Though not initially important players in the operation, Freamon proved a quietly capable investigator with a knack for noticing tiny but important details, and Prez, while a liability on the street, turned out to be a natural at his desk job. McNulty and Bunk served in a homicide unit squad led by Sergeant Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams), the jovial squad commander. Peter Gerety had a recurring role as Judge Phelan, the official who started the case moving. There were also several recurring characters in the Barksdale Organization. Loyal Wee-Bey Brice (Hassan Johnson) was responsible for multiple homicides carried out on Avon's orders. Working under D'Angelo were Poot Carr (Tray Chaney), Bodie Broadus (J.D. Williams), and Wallace (Michael B. Jordan), all street-level drug dealers. Wallace was an intelligent but na√Øve youth trapped in the drug trade, Bodie a violent and determined young dealer, and Poot a lascivious young man happy to follow rather than lead. Omar Little (Michael K. Williams), a notorious Baltimore stick-up man robbing drug dealers for a living, was a frequent thorn in the side of the Barksdale clan.

Some called it superior to HBO's better-known \\"flagship\\" drama series such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under. One reviewer felt that the show was partially a retread of themes from HBO and David Simon's earlier works but still valuable viewing and described the series as particularly resonant because it parallels the war on terror through the chronicling of the war on drugs. Another review postulated that the series might suffer because of its reliance on profanity and slowly drawn-out plot, but was largely positive about the show's characters and intrigue. TIME named the first season as the best TV show of 2002 in their Top 10 Everything 2002. Despite the critical acclaim, The Wire has received poor Nielsen ratings, which Simon attributes to the complexity of the plot, a poor time slot, heavy use of esoteric slang, particularly among the gangster characters and a predominantly black cast. Critics felt the show was testing the attention span of its audience and felt that it was mistimed in the wake of the launch of the successful crime drama The Shield on FX. However, anticipation for a release of the first season on DVD was high at Entertainment Weekly. =Awards and nominations= 19th TCA Awards *Nomination for Program of the Year *Nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Drama *Nomination for Outstanding New Program of the Year  Episodes   References   External links  2002 American television seasons 1 ","title":"The Wire (season 1)"},{"id":"14346357","text":"Cyclone Guba (JTWC designation: 02P, also known as Severe Tropical Cyclone Guba) was the most recent tropical cyclone to form in the Port Moresby area of responsibility. The storm resulted in 149 fatalities and severe damage across southeastern Papua New Guinea in November 2007. The firstly-named cyclone of the 2007‚Äì08 Australian region cyclone season, Guba formed on 13 November 2007 close to the island of New Guinea, and reached tropical cyclone intensity the next day by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Brisbane, with the TCWC in Port Moresby assigning the name Guba. It meandered in the northern Coral Sea for the next week, strengthening to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on 16 November. It posed a threat to the Australian Cape York Peninsula, but remained offshore, and finally dissipated on 20 November. Meteorological history On 12 November, a weak tropical low developed within the Solomon Sea, near the Papua New Guinean island of New Britain. During that day, the system's low level circulation centre drifted south- westwards, within an area favourable for further development, with low vertical wind shear and a good outflow. However, the disturbance could not significantly develop further at this time, as it was interacting with New Guinea. The system subsequently either passed near or over the south-eastern tip of New Guinea and moved into the north-western Coral Sea, where it quickly developed further with the aid of a south-easterly wind surge. As a result, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 02P during 13 October. TCWC Brisbane initiated tropical cyclone advices on the tropical low early on 14 November, with a cyclone watch declared for the northern coastal and island communities in the Cape York Peninsula. Shortly after, TCWC Brisbane upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone Guba, a name assigned by the TCWC in Port Moresby.Gale Warning for North Eastern Area: Tropical Cyclone Guba.

Retrieved on 14 November 2007. Guba drifted erratically off the Queensland coast for the next two days, and cyclone warnings were cancelled when TCWC Brisbane expected the cyclone to remain slow-moving. Guba began drifting southwards and intensified on 16 November, becoming a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone. Guba was a small, but intense system, forming a well- defined eye. Guba began weakening on 17 November and was downgraded to a Category 2\\\\. After downgraded to a Category 1 cyclone on 18 November, it started to accelerate to the west towards the Queensland coast. Cyclone watches and warnings were declared again on 19 November as the cyclone was expected to move closer to the coast and intensify. This did not materialise, however, as Guba then turned northwards later that day, avoiding the Australian mainland, then northeast while it continued to weaken. TCWC Brisbane downgraded Guba below tropical cyclone strength, and issued its last advisory early on 20 November. Impact As a tropical low, the precursor to Guba brought torrential rains to portions of Papua New Guinea, leading to widespread landslides and flooding. The most severe damage took place in Oro Province where 149 people were confirmed to have been killed by the storm. Damage from the storm was believed to have exceeded 500 million kina (US$177 million). Flooding in Papua New Guinea led to at least 200 deaths.\\"RA V Twelfth Session report\\" About 2,000 people were evacuated in the Oro Province as a result of the flooding. Roads, bridges and 40 houses were washed away, as tides in the area reached two metres high. In the provincial capital, Popondetta, the water supply and electrical infrastructure was damaged, and road access was blocked. Papua New Guinea's national airline, Air Niugini, suspended flights to Popondetta's main airport. The Rabaraba district in Milne Bay Province was also hit by flooding, with 30 houses and food gardens washed away, and forcing the evacuation of about 100 people.

Naming Severe Tropical Cyclone Guba, with a minimum pressure of 970 hPa (mbar), was the second weakest cyclone within the South Pacific, that either the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Brisbane, Australia or the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Nadi, Fiji had monitored in the south Pacific that season. This was the first time that a cyclone had been called Guba anywhere in the world. The name Guba was retired by the World Meteorological Organization, and was replaced with the name Maila. Tropical cyclones rarely form in TCWC Port Moresby's Area of Responsibility. When a cyclone does form, it automatically gets its name retired. Guba was the first tropical cyclone to be assigned a name from Port Moresby's name lists since Tropical Cyclone Epi in 2003. It is the first tropical cyclone to occur in the Queensland region in the month of November since 1977.\\"Cyclone Guba stews under southery drift\\", Brisbane Times, 15 November 2007.

In 1927, he began his Hollywood career writing the titles for silent movies. He graduated to directing in the early 1930s, but after six films he abandoned that field in order to concentrate on writing. The films with Davis included It's Love I'm After, Dark Victory, The Old Maid, All This, and Heaven Too, Now, Voyager, and The Corn Is Green. Robinson's production credits include Days of Glory, Under My Skin, and Two Flags West, all of which he scripted as well. He also worked on three weeks of re-writes for Casablanca, but was uncredited. In 1935, Robinson was a write-in candidate for what was then called the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay for his work on Captain Blood. After spending the better part of the 1930s and the early 1940s working at Warner Bros., Robinson moved to MGM in the mid-'40s, then to 20th Century Fox in the 1950s.

The th√©√¢trophone evolved from a Cl√©ment Ader invention, which was first demonstrated in 1881, in Paris. Subsequently, in 1890, the invention was commercialized by Compagnie du Th√©√¢trophone, which continued to operate until 1932. Origin Diagram of the th√©√¢trophone prototype at the Opera, during the World Exhibition in Paris (1881). An 1884 caricature by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro depicts King Lu√≠s I of Portugal listening to opera on th√©√¢trophone. The origin of the th√©√¢trophone can be traced to a telephonic transmission system demonstrated by Cl√©ment Ader at the 1881 World Expo in Paris. The system was inaugurated by the French President Jules Gr√©vy, and allowed broadcasting of concerts or plays. Ader had arranged 80 telephone transmitters across the front of a stage to create a form of binaural stereophonic sound. It was the first two-channel audio system, and consisted of a series of telephone transmitters connected from the stage of the Paris Opera to a suite of rooms at the Paris Electrical Exhibition, where the visitors could hear Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and opera performances in stereo using two headphones; the Opera was located more than two kilometers away from the venue. In a note dated 11 November 1881, Victor Hugo describes his first experience of th√©√¢trophone as pleasant. In 1884, the King Lu√≠s I of Portugal decided to use the system, when he could not attend an opera in person. The director of the Edison Gower Bell Company, who was responsible for this th√©√¢trophone installation, was later awarded the Military Order of Christ. The th√©√¢trophone technology was made available in Belgium in 1884, and in Lisbon in 1885. In Sweden, the first telephone transmission of an opera performance took place in Stockholm in May 1887. The British writer Ouida describes a female character in the novel Massarenes (1897) as \\"A modern woman of the world. As costly as an ironclad and as complicated as theatrophone.\\" Le th√©√¢trophone. An illustration from Le Magasin pittoresque (1892). The Th√©√¢trophone service In 1890, the system became operational as a service under the name \\"th√©√¢trophone\\" in Paris. The service was offered by Compagnie du Th√©√¢trophone (The Th√©√¢trophone Company), which was founded by MM. Marinovitch and Szarvady. The th√©√¢trophone offered theatre and opera performances to the subscribers. The service can be called a prototype of the telephone newspaper, as it included five-minute news programs at regular intervals. The Th√©√¢trophone Company set up coin-operated telephone receivers in hotels, caf√©s, clubs, and other locations, costing 50 centimes for five minutes of listening. The subscription tickets were also issued at a reduced rate, in order to attract regular patrons. The service was also available to home subscribers. French writer Marcel Proust was a keen follower of th√©√¢trophone, as evident by his correspondence. He subscribed to the service in 1911. Many technological improvements were gradually made to the original th√©√¢trophone system. The Brown telephone relay, invented in 1913, yielded interesting results for amplification of the current. The th√©√¢trophone finally succumbed to the rising popularity of radio broadcasting and the phonograph, and the Compagnie du Th√©√¢trophone ceased its operations in 1932. Similar systems Similar systems elsewhere in Europe included Telefon H√≠rmond√≥ (est. 1893) of Budapest and Electrophone of London (est. 1895). In the United States, the systems similar to th√©√¢trophone were limited to one-off experiments. Erik Barnouw reported a concert by telephone that was organized in the summer of 1890; around 800 people at the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga listened to a telephonic transmission of The Charge of the Light Brigade conducted at Madison Square Garden. In fiction The Andrew Crumey novel Mr Mee (2000) has a chapter depicting the installation of a th√©√¢trophone in the home of Marcel Proust. The E√ßa de Queiroz novel A Cidade e as Serras (1901) mentions the device as one of the many technological commodities available for the distraction of the upper classes. In his utopian science fiction novel Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888), Edward Bellamy predicted sermons and music being available in the home through a system like th√©√¢trophone.

She studied at the W.P.A. Art Class (1939), Nassau Art League (1940), the American Artists School (1942), and with Sol Wilson at the Art Students League of New York (1943). Biography Wallenrod had her first solo exhibition at the Roko Gallery (1946) and then belonged for many years to the Charles Barzansky Gallery, both in New York City. She also participated in numerous group exhibitions in the late forties until the early nineteen sixties. Lucille Wallenrod was handicapped from birth with cerebral palsy, and she painted with a special arm brace of her own design. She painted dramatic expressionist seascapes, with broad strokes and deep vivid colours, and still lifes and portraits as well. She won a number of competitions, most notably the first prize in the National Art Contest sponsored by the then President Eisenhower‚Äôs Committee on the Handicapped in 1956. Judges for this competition were Isabel Bishop and Andrew Wyeth. Her work was often reviewed in New York and Long Island newspapers. Due to a long terminal illness, Lucille Wallenrod‚Äôs output waned in her later years, yet her interest and sensitivity for the arts never faltered. She died in Ridge, New York in 1998. Her husband, Gerald Dreyblatt, died in Florida in 2008. She is survived by her son, Arnold Dreyblatt, who is a composer and media artist living in Berlin, Germany.

This species can also be found in the aquarium trade. It is also known as the bar-eyed goby, flat-headed goby and the Gangetic tank goby. Description The head is depressed with a protruding lower jaw while the body takes on a compressed appearance towards to caudal fin. Normally brown or light brown with various darker brown spots and flecks along the sides. Ranges in size from 40 to 50 cm maximum (16-20 inches).  Habitat  This subtropical species is most often associated with estuarine habitats, although it is also found in marine water and can be found many kilometers inland in freshwater streams, up to inland in Malawi. This species is a benthopelagic and amphidromous goby which is found in clear to turbid streams with rock, gravel, or sandy substrates.  Reproduction  Lays eggs amongst submerged vegetation, where the eggs are guarded by both the male and the female. They will spawn in freshwater, the eggs being taken to the sea by the current, although it can complete its whole life cycle in freshwater. In South Africa it breeds in the summer while in northern Australia breeding takes place in the dry season.  Feeding  A carnivorous fish, it will eat any small fish and invertebrates it comes across. Cannibalism has been recorded. According to the index of abundance the preferred food items in guts were recorded as; fish (44.75%), semi digested food (22.46%), insect (12%), debris & detritus (6.78%), crustacean (5.93%), fish scale (4.76%), fish egg (1.53%), zooplankton (0.83%), plant (0.63%) and mollusk (0.33%) by volume. The ratio of total length (TL) and total gut length (TGL) was 1:0.252. Gut length was about less than half of the total length of the fish, which also indicated the carnivorous nature of feeding habit of the fish. Human Interaction Unusually for a goby this species is commercially exploited, possibly due to its large size, and sold fresh or frozen. It also appears in the aquarium trade.

The species was transported to other islands by a tribe of the Seri as a potential food source. Taxonomy and etymology The generic name, Sauromalus, is said to be a combination of two ancient Greek words: sauros meaning \\"lizard\\" and omalus meaning \\"flat\\". The proper ancient Greek word for \\"flat\\" is however homalos (·ΩÅŒºŒ±ŒªœåœÇ) or homalƒìs (·ΩÅŒºŒ±ŒªŒÆœÇ).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Its specific name hispidus is Latin for \\"coarse\\" or \\"thorny\\" in reference to the spines on the chuckwalla's tail. The common name chuckwalla derives from the Shoshone word tcaxxwal or Cahuilla caxwal, transcribed by Spaniards as chacahuala. Description The Angel Island chuckwalla is the second-largest species of chuckwalla, reaching in body length and overall length, and weighing up to . It is considered a gigantic species as it is two to three times the size of its mainland counterparts. Its body color is a dark brown color with transverse black bands which fade into a solid darker brown to black color as the animal ages. Distribution and habitat The Angel Island chuckwalla is endemic to Isla √Ångel de la Guarda and 10 smaller islands in the Gulf of California.  Behavior and reproduction  Harmless to humans, these lizards are known to run from potential threats. When disturbed, the chuckwalla inflates its lungs, distends its body, and wedges itself into a tight rock crevice.Stebbins, Robert C.,(2003) A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians, 3rd Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, Deban, S.M., J.C. O‚ÄôReilly, and T.C. Theimer 1994. Mechanism of defensive inflation in the chuckwalla, Sauromalus obesus. Journal of Experimental Zoology 270: 451-459. Males are seasonally and conditionally territorial; an abundance of resources tends to create a hierarchy based on size, with one large male dominating the area's smaller males. Chuckwallas defend their territory and communicate with one another using a combination of color and physical displays, namely \\"push ups\\", head-hobbing, and gaping of the mouth. Angel Island chuckwallas are diurnal animals, and as they are exothermic, spend much of their mornings and winter days basking. These lizards are well adapted to desert conditions; they are active at temperatures up to 102 ¬∞F (39 ¬∞C). Mating occurs from April to July, with five to 16 eggs laid between June and August. The eggs hatch in late September. Chuckwallas may live for 25 years or more. Diet Chuckwallas prefer dwelling in lava flows and rocky areas with nooks and crannies available for a retreat when threatened. These areas are typically vegetated by creosote bush and cholla cacti which form the staple of their diet as the chuckwalla is primarily herbivorous. Chuckwallas also feed on leaves, fruit, and flowers of annuals and perennial plants; insects represent a supplementary prey if eaten at all. Human contact The Comca‚Äôac considered this species of chuckwalla an important food item.Richard Felger and Mary B. Moser (1985) People of the desert and sea: ethnobotany of the Seri Indians Tucson: University of Arizona Press. So much so, a few lizards were cross-bred with San Esteban chuckwallas and translocated to most of the islands in Bahia de los Angeles: Isla San Lorenzo Norte, Isla San Lorenzo Sur, and Tibur√≥n Island by the Seri people for use as a food source in times of need. This was before the founding of America and most of these populations appear to have died out, but the process was repeated by herpeticulturalists in the early 2000s as a way of legally producing a San Esteban-like chuckwalla that the average reptile enthusiast could keep. The crosses are fertile and seem to have the best traits of both species - the brighter coloration of the San Esteban chuckwalla with the calmer temperament of the Angel Island chuckwalla.

Career Armstrong started out playing ten-pin bowling until she was pregnant and decided to pick up darts. From then, she has quickly risen to be one of the top women players in the world. She picked up wins in the singles and pairs events in the Belgium Open and Finland Open, and followed it up with a win in the German Open pairs with Carina Ekberg of Sweden.World Darts Federation Official Homepage Armstrong's greatest achievement to date came at the 2007 WDF World Cup in Rosmalen, Netherlands, where she won the women' pairs title with Anastasia Dobromyslova. Armstrong's performances in 2008 included wins in the French Open, Dortmund Open, German Gold Cup, Open Holland, and the Primus Masters. She was also the runner-up of the England Open, Swiss Open, and the Danish Open, and moved to as high as third in the world rankings. Despite her successes during 2008, Armstrong was surprisingly overlooked for a place in the Zuiderduin Masters, a BDO major held in the Netherlands. Having missed out initially on an automatic place for the tournament by just one place, a spot was made available after Anastasia Dobromyslova was forced to withdraw from the competition, but it was given to Lisa Ashton instead, who would go on to win the tournament. Still hoping for a wild card, the card was handed to German player Monique Lessmeister, who at the time was ranked 66 places below Armstrong in the world rankings. Armstrong continued her good form into 2009 and secured qualification for the Lakeside World Championship by winning the England Open. She also made up for last year's disappointment by ensuring qualification for the Zuiderduin. 2010 saw Armstrong at Lakeside for the first time, losing the quarter finals to Deta Hedman. During the course of the year, Armstrong had the following results: *2010 Lakeside debut *2010 German Open, runner up *2010 Open North Holland, Champion *2010 Mariflex Open, runner up *2010 Antwerp Open, semi finalist *2010 Swiss Open, champion *2010 Belgium Open, semi finalist *2010 Sweden Open, runner up *2010 Welsh Masters, semi finalist *2010 British Open, semi finals Armstrong once again qualified for Lakeside, 2011, and lost in the semi finals.

Armstrong always felt though that it was not right playing for Russia as she never played in any Russian ranking events in order to qualify for the team. Having lived in Germany for many years, and with the German organisation asking her on several occasions, Armstrong took time out from international appearances in order to be eligible for the German team. In 2013, she made her debut at the WDF World Cup singles for Germany in Canada where she finished runner up to England's Deta Hedman. This was not her debut for Germany though she had previously played in the Lorna Croft Friendship Cup, helping Germany to win it for the first time in its history. She also played for Germany in the WDF Europe Cup. Personal life Armstrong is married to Englishman John Armstrong, with two children, son Christian and daughter Ksenia. She currently resides in Gangelt, Germany and previously lived in the Netherlands. She is fluent in German and English.

Proactive behavior involves acting in advance of a future situation, rather than just reacting. It means taking control and making things happen rather than just adjusting to a situation or waiting for something to happen. Proactive employees generally do not need to be asked to act, nor do they require detailed instructions. Proactive behavior can be contrasted with other work-related behaviors, such as proficiency, i.e. the fulfillment of predictable requirements of one‚Äôs job, or adaptability, the successful coping with and support of change initiated by others in the organization. In regard to the latter, whereas adaptability is about responding to change, proactivity is about initiating change. Proactivity is not restricted to extra role performance behaviors. Employees can be proactive in their prescribed role (e.g. by changing the way they perform a core task to be more efficient). Likewise, behaviors labeled as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) can be carried out proactively or passively. For example, the altruistic OCB can be proactive in nature (e.g. offering help to co-workers before they ask for assistance). It aims at the identification and exploring of opportunities in taking action against the potential problems and threats . Most of the individuals who are positive , energetic, intelligent, follow the path of proactive. The tools of proactive are considered to as follows. Self confidence Being self motivated Positive attitude towards situations Goal setting Having hope Facing challenges.  History  The use of the word proactive (or pro-active) was limited to the domain of experimental psychology in the 1930s, and used with a different meaning.proactive - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. Merriam Webster dates the origin of the word to 1933. Oxford English Dictionary (OED)proactive - Definition from the Oxford English Dictionary credits Paul Whiteley and Gerald Blankfort, citing their 1933 paper discussing proactive inhibition as the \\"impairment or retardation of learning or of the remembering of what is learned by effects that remain active from conditions prior to the learning\\". In another related meaning, the 1946 book Man's Search for Meaning brought the word to the wider public domain. The author, Austrian existential neuropsychiatrist Dr. Viktor Frankl, used the word to describe a person who took responsibility for his or her life, rather than looking for causes in outside circumstances or other people. Frankl stressed the importance of courage, perseverance, individual responsibility and awareness of the existence of choices, regardless of the situation or context. Etymologically, this is a \\"centaur\\" word (like \\"bi-cycle\\"), combining a Greek prefix (\\"pro-\\" meaning \\"before\\") with a Latin root, \\"active\\". The Latin prefix \\"pre-\\" (\\"before\\") could have been used, but perhaps it would then be confused with \\"re-active\\".

The League of the Rhine (also known as the Erste Rheinbund, First Rhine-Bund; or the Rheinische Allianz - Rhenish Alliance) was a defensive union of more than 50 German princes and their cities along the River Rhine, formed on 14 August 1658 by Louis XIV of France and negotiated by Cardinal Mazarin (the de facto prime minister of France), Hugues de Lionne and Johann Philipp von Sch√∂nborn (Elector of Mainz and Chancellor of the Empire). Aims Its intended aim was to weaken the position of the Holy Roman Emperor (then Leopold I) and to marginalise the Austrian House of Habsburg. Louis XIV had wished to be elected emperor himself, but had failed, despite the French victory at the Battle of the Dunes. The new confederation allied itself to France, swearing not to let any anti-French troops (marching to attack France in the Spanish Netherlands or elsewhere) pass through their territory, thus protecting France's eastern frontier with a \\"military border\\" running along the Rhine and cutting Austria off from the Spanish Netherlands. Sweden was guaranteed its German possessions in Bremen-Verden, and later also those in Swedish Pomerania. The League's members also swore to maintain the clauses of the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which had made the League possible by authorising the German princes, immediate vassals of the Emperor, to conclude alliances between themselves or with foreign states.  Existence and legacy  On August 14, 1658, the League of the Rhine was formed by: *Karl Kaspar von der Leyen, Prince Elector of Trier *Johann Philipp von Sch√∂nborn, Prince Elector of Mainz *Maximilian Henry, Prince Elector of Cologne *Bernhard von Galen, bishop of M√ºnster *Philip William, Palatine of Palatinate-Neuburg *Ferdinand Maria, duke of Bavaria *Wilhelm VI, landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) *Augustus the Younger, duke of Brunswick *Charles X, king of Sweden The League fielded a force of 6000 to fight on the side of France and the Empire against the Ottomans, seeing action in the 1664 Battle of Saint Gotthard. The League was promulgated to last for three years, which was later twice extended. It officially ended in August 1667, but its end should in fact be dated to 1668 since French diplomacy succeeded in negotiating a further extension of the alliance as the Rheinbundrat, made up only of the main members of the League, which lasted to 1688. The League was later resurrected by Napoleon as the Confederation of the Rhine, which gave the final death-blow to the Holy Roman Empire.

Bianco and Simmons took on lead vocal duties as well, resulting in a unique three-frontwoman lineup. This expanded version of Motorpsychos debuted in January 2004 and quickly began accumulating accomplishments, including a first-place finish in the Rolling Rock Hard & Heavy Rock Wars in 2004. Their second album Piston Whipped, recorded with prize money, was released in January 2005 and featured Bianco, Simmons, and Krizner all singing lead on alternating tracks. Following the album's release, the band placed strongly in several national rock competitions, becoming finalists in the 2005 Zippo Hot Tour Competition \\"Duquesne Duke\\", February 27, 2006 and winning the 2005 K-Rock, Hard Rock Winter Rock Challenge, a competition with 107 other bands.\\"Nightwire\\", Motorpsychos Win the 93.7 K-Rock/Hard Rock Cafe Winter Rock Challenge, April 2005 Motorpsychos were also awarded with slots on the WXDX X-Fest in 2005 and the Warped Tour in 2005 and 2006.\\"Pittsburgh Rock Press\\", April 2005 The band's third album, Coming of Rage, was released on January 31, 2009.

These conditions were collected during the late 1970s.E. Minguzzi and M. Sanchez, The causal hierarchy of spacetimes in H. Baum and D. Alekseevsky (eds.), vol. Recent developments in pseudo-Riemannian geometry, ESI Lect. Math. Phys., (Eur. Math. Soc. Publ.

Spacetimes with closed timelike curves, for example, present severe interpretational difficulties. See the grandfather paradox. It is reasonable to believe that any physical spacetime will satisfy the strongest causality condition: global hyperbolicity. For such spacetimes the equations in general relativity can be posed as an initial value problem on a Cauchy surface.  The hierarchy  There is a hierarchy of causality conditions, each one of which is strictly stronger than the previous. This is sometimes called the causal ladder. The conditions, from weakest to strongest, are: * Non-totally vicious * Chronological * Causal * Distinguishing * Strongly causal * Stably causal * Causally continuous * Causally simple * Globally hyperbolic Given are the definitions of these causality conditions for a Lorentzian manifold (M,g). Where two or more are given they are equivalent. Notation: * p \\\\ll q denotes the chronological relation. * p \\\\prec q denotes the causal relation. (See causal structure for definitions of \\\\,I^+(x), \\\\,I^-(x) and \\\\,J^+(x), \\\\,J^-(x).)  Non-totally vicious  * For some points p \\\\in M we have p ot\\\\ll p.

Stably causal  A manifold satisfying any of the weaker causality conditions defined above may fail to do so if the metric is given a small perturbation. A spacetime is stably causal if it cannot be made to contain closed causal curves by arbitrarily small perturbations of the metric. Stephen Hawking showedS.W. Hawking, The existence of cosmic time functions Proc. R. Soc. Lond. (1969), A308, 433 that this is equivalent to: * There exists a global time function on M. This is a scalar field t on M whose gradient abla^a t is everywhere timelike and future-directed. This global time function gives us a stable way to distinguish between future and past for each point of the spacetime (and so we have no causal violations).

Relativistic effects are those discrepancies between values calculated by models considering and not considering relativity.

Speed is empirically measured as average speed, although current devices in common use can estimate speed over very small intervals and closely approximate instantaneous speed.

It introduces the stevedores of the Port of Baltimore and an international organized crime operation led by a figure known only as The Greek and continues the story with the drug-dealing Barksdale crew and the Baltimore Police Department who featured in . While continuing the series' central themes of dysfunctional institutions and the societal effects of the drug trade, the second season also explores the decline of the American working class, and the hardship its members endure during the transition from an industrial to post-industrial society. It was released as a five-disc DVD boxed set in January 2005. Summary The second season continued to follow the police and those involved with the Barksdale drug-dealing organization. The returning cast included Dominic West as Officer Jimmy McNulty, whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems continued to overshadow his ability. Lance Reddick reprised his role as Lieutenant Cedric Daniels, who was sidelined because of his placement of case over career, but used his political acumen to regain some status. Sonja Sohn played Kima Greggs, who had transferred to a desk job, but could not resist the lure of a good case. Deirdre Lovejoy continued as assistant state's attorney Rhonda Pearlman, the legal liaison between the detail and the courthouse. Wood Harris and Larry Gilliard, Jr. reprised their roles as newly incarcerated drug dealers Avon and D'Angelo Barksdale. Idris Elba's character Stringer Bell took over the operations of the Barksdale Organization. Andre Royo returned as Bubbles, who continued to indulge his drug addiction and act as an occasional informant. The police were overseen by two commanding officers who are concerned with politics and promoting their own careers: Colonel William Rawls (John Doman) and Acting Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison). Wendell Pierce portrayed homicide detective Bunk Moreland, who became more involved with the core case. Previously recurring guest star Clarke Peters joined the starring cast and his character, veteran detective Lester Freamon, joined the homicide unit as Moreland's new partner. The new season also introduced a further group of characters working in the Baltimore port area, including Spiros \\"Vondas\\" Vondopoulos (Paul Ben-Victor), Beadie Russell (Amy Ryan), and Frank Sobotka (Chris Bauer). Vondas was the underboss of a global smuggling operation, Russell an inexperienced Port Authority officer and single mother thrown in at the deep end of a multiple homicide investigation, and Sobotka a union leader who turned to crime in order to raise funds to save his union. Also joining the show in season two were recurring characters Nick Sobotka (Pablo Schreiber), Frank's nephew; Ziggy Sobotka (James Ransone), Frank's troubled son; and \\"The Greek\\" (Bill Raymond), Vondas' mysterious boss. Returning guest stars included: Jim True- Frost as Detective Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski; Seth Gilliam as newly promoted Sergeant Ellis Carver; Domenick Lombardozzi as errant Detective Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk; J.D.

Description The trout barb has an elongated, slender body which is laterally compressed with a sharp snout. The juvenile fish possess a pair of rudimentary maxillary barbels but these are absent in the adults. It has very small scales and has 85-95 scales along its lateral line. It has a forked tail. The dorsal part of the body is greenish black, separated from the silvery flanks by a golden stripe running along the length of the body. The fins are yellowish in colour and there are a number of greenish blue spots on the body. The maximum length is 35 cm and the grow up to 2.3 kg in weight. Disitribution The trout barb is found in the Indian states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa. It also occurs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. Trout barbs were introduced into two lakes near Pune in 1926, where they subsequently successfully bred. Habitat and ecology The trout barb is found in rivers and streams and also in ditches and canals. In India it prefers clear streams with rocky riverbeds. It breeds during early monsoon season, in June, spawning in heavily flooded areas. It is sexually mature at around three years old, during the spawning seasons the males become brighter and the skin on their flanks becomes rougher. The wide mouth and stream-lined body are adaptations for an actively predatory lifestyle. Conservation The trout barb is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN but the population is thought to be declining due to illegal and destructive fishing methods. Fishing The trout barb is said to have a delicate flavoured flesh and to make good sport for fly fishermen.

Scott was charged with first- and second-degree child abuse, first- and second-degree assault, and reckless endangerment. She was ordered to be held in jail on $75,000 bail. Frederick County Assistant State's Attorney Lindell K. Angel had urged Circuit Court Judge G. Edward Dwyer to set Scott's bail at $250,000, calling her a danger to herself and others. Defense attorney Mary Drawbaugh had asked for a lower bail, stating that Scott turned herself in and kept her weekly psychiatric appointments. Munchausen syndrome evidenced by Scott in the past According to court statements, Scott had previously feigned cancer for about a year between 2002 and 2003 by shaving her head and eyebrows and plucking her eyelashes. She moved about using a wheelchair or walker most of the time, convincing her husband, pastor, and friends that she was seriously ill. While it is unclear if there was a definitive past diagnosis, Angel characterized Scott in the 16 November 2007 hearing as having \\"a history of Munchausen syndrome.\\" Daughter's illness and investigation In the hearing, Angel described how Scott intravenously fed her daughter magnesium and withdrew blood to make her appear sickly and caused her daughter to suffer from severe diarrhea, blood loss, vomiting, high fever, and a rapid heart rate. During this time, her daughter was being treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, but doctors there had been unable to find a cause for her symptoms. During three years of inpatient and outpatient treatments at Walter Reed, 72 procedures had been performed on the child, including blood transfusions and bone marrow tests because of suspicions of leukemia. Doctors admitted that if not for that suspicion, none of the procedures likely would have been required. In Scott's May 2008 sentencing trial, Dr. Arthur deLorimier, a lieutenant colonel at Walter Reed, testified that the girl faced increased risks of cancer from repeated radiological tests, was developmentally delayed, and in danger of future emotional problems. Online journal While the child was at Walter Reed, Scott had been posting an online diary documenting the travails of parenting a seriously ill child, Angel said. \\"The doctors are at a loss,\\" Angel said, reading from the journal. \\"But we will continue to go on, and through friends, the hospital and everyone's prayers, we'll get through this.\\" Trial and sentence Scott entered a guilty plea to first-degree child abuse on 13 March 2008. In the hearing, Scott's defense attorney acknowledged her client intentionally harmed her child during the six-week period from 1 May to 12 June 2007, and conceded that the state could prove Scott committed the most serious of those acts during this time period. Judge Dwyer, again presiding, accepted Scott's plea and convicted her of abuse from 1 May to 12 June 2007. As part of the plea agreement, fourteen other charges against Scott were dropped, including allegations of assault and reckless endangerment. Dwyer ordered Scott to remain on home detention while awaiting trial and prohibited her from having contact with her children or entering Fort Detrick. In a six-hour sentencing hearing on 8 May 2008, Drawbaugh urged Dwyer to confine Scott to her home, allowing her to continue intensive psychotherapy to deal with severe mental illnesses. However, after hearing prosecution testimony as well, Judge Dwyer ordered Scott to serve 15 years of a 25-year sentence for the actions to which she had pleaded guilty.

The Marquesas Islands are a group of volcanic islands in French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France in the southern Pacific Ocean. The Marquesas Islands form one of the five Administrative divisions of French Polynesia.  Prehistory  The first recorded settlers of the Marquesas were Polynesians. Based on a variety of arch√¶ological evidence, researchers at one time believed they arrived from 100-600AD. Ethnological and linguistic evidence suggests that they likely arrived from the western region of Tonga and Samoa. But, a 2010 study using revised, high-precision radiocarbon dating based on more reliable samples suggested that the period of eastern Polynesian colonization took place much later, in a shorter time frame of two waves: the \\"earliest in the Society Islands A.D. ‚àº1025‚Äì1120, four centuries later than previously assumed; then after 70‚Äì265 y, dispersal continued in one major pulse to all remaining islands A.D. ‚àº1190‚Äì1290.\\"Janet M.

European exploration  1876 The islands were given their name by the Spanish explorer √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira who reached them on 21 July 1595. He named them after his patron, Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca√±ete, who was Viceroy of Peru at the time. Menda√±a visited first Fatu Hiva and then Tahuata before continuing on to the Solomon Islands. De Neira also discovered an ancient cross on one of the islands. Historians have speculated that this may have marked the grave of a sailor from San Lesmes, a Spanish vessel which disappeared in a storm during Garc√≠a Jofre de Loa√≠sa's expedition through the region in 1526. The American navigator Capt. Joseph Ingraham first visited the northern Marquesas while commanding the brig in 1791, giving them the name Washington Islands. In 1813, Commodore David Porter claimed Nuku Hiva for the United States, but the United States Congress never ratified that claim. A sperm whale on 20 November 1820 rammed and sank the United States whaler Essex near the Marquesas Islands. Forced to take refuge in three small boats, the crew avoided the Marquesas because of having heard (largely spurious) reports of cannibalism among the island's inhabitants. Instead the crew turned east toward South America, much farther away. Many died, and the survivors resorted to cannibalism to reach the end of their three-month-long voyage.Nathaniel Philbrick, In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex, New York: Viking Press, 2001 In 1842, France, following a successful military operation on behalf of a native chief (named Iotete) who claimed to be king of the whole of the island of Tahuata, took possession of the whole group, establishing a settlement (abandoned in 1859) on Nuku Hiva. French re- established control over the group in 1870, and later incorporated into the territory of French Polynesia. Paul Gauguin and other French artists traveled to the Marquesas Islands and other areas of Polynesia in the 19th century to live and work at his art. The islands were regularly visited by whaling and trading ships of various nations. Of all the major island groups of the Pacific, the Marquesas Islands suffered the greatest population decline as a result of Eurasian endemic diseases carried by European explorers, which resulted in epidemics, particularly of smallpox, to which they had no acquired immunity. The estimated 16th-century population of over 100,000 inhabitants, was reduced to about 20,000 by the middle of the nineteenth century, and to just over 2,000 by the beginning of the 1900s. During the course of the twentieth century, the population began to revive, increasing to about 8,500 by 2002, not including the Marquesan community residing on Tahiti. It has continued to increase since then.

Consequently, the group left RPM in 1958 and signed a one record recording contract with RCA Records, who released \\"Dear Tommy\\". This also failed to make much of an impact on the charts.

It introduces Baltimore's local politicians and the upstart drug dealing Stanfield organization while continuing to examine the Barksdale Organization and the Baltimore Police Department. The third season aired on Sundays at 9:00 pm ET in the United States to widespread critical acclaim. The season was released on DVD as a five disc boxed set under the title of The Wire: The Complete Third Season on August 8, 2006 by HBO Video. Production Following the death of Robert F. Colesberry, director Joe Chappelle joined the production staff as a co-executive producer and continued to regularly direct episodes. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics. David Simon had originally hoped to create a city hall spinoff show, which would run in tandem with subsequent seasons of The Wire, and had even written scripts for it. But HBO declined, according to Simon: \\"HBO said, 'No, we only want one show that nobody is watching in Baltimore, not two!'\\". Cast =Starring cast= The third season returned with the focus on investigating the Barksdale Organization and introducing new characters such as the rival Stanfield Organization and local politicians. The returning cast consisted of Dominic West as Detective Jimmy McNulty, whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems continued to overshadow his ability; Lance Reddick as Lieutenant Cedric Daniels, now commanding his own unit; Kima Greggs, played by Sonja Sohn, now McNulty's new partner within the unit; Clarke Peters as Lester Freamon; Deirdre Lovejoy as Assistant State's Attorney Rhonda Pearlman. Wood Harris reprised his role as incarcerated drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Idris Elba's character Stringer Bell continued to run the Barksdale Organization in Avon's absence. Andre Royo returned as Bubbles, who continued to indulge his drug addiction and act as an occasional informant. Deputy Commissioner of Operations William Rawls (John Doman) and Acting Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison), the two commanding officers, seem to be more concerned with politics and their own careers than actual police work. Wendell Pierce portrayed veteran homicide detective Bunk Moreland. The new season saw several previously recurring characters assuming larger starring roles, including Seth Gilliam as Sergeant Ellis Carver, Domenick Lombardozzi as Detective Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk, Detective Leander Sydnor (Corey Parker Robinson), Detective Roland Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost), Bodie Broadus (J.D. Williams), Omar Little (Michael K. Williams), and Major Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin (Robert Wisdom). Colvin commanded the Western district where the Barksdale organization operated, and nearing retirement, he came up with a radical new method of dealing with the drug problem. Herc and Carver joined the Western District Drug Enforcement Unit under Colvin's command. Sydnor, a rising young star in the police department in season 1, returned to the cast as part of the major crimes unit along with Pryzbylewski. Bodie had been seen gradually rising in the Barksdale organization since the first episode; he was born to their trade and showed a fierce aptitude for it. Omar had a vendetta against the Barksdale organization and gave them all of his lethal attention. A new starring character was also introduced in the third season: Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen), an ambitious city councilman. Several members of the second season starring cast did not return for the third season with the change in focus and the termination of some characters' storylines. Chris Bauer (Frank Sobotka), Paul Ben-Victor (Spiros Vondas) and Amy Ryan (Beadie Russell) all left the starring cast with the third season. Ryan returned as a guest star for a short scene at the end of the season.

Russell and Justin Burley as young drug dealers Jamal and Justin. The Barksdale Organization also found several new recruits: Slim Charles (Anwan Glover), Avon's new chief enforcer; Bernard (Melvin Jackson, Jr.), responsible for procuring disposable cell phones; and Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise (Chad Coleman), a newly released convict uncertain of his future. The introduction of a political storyline brought many new characters. Glynn Turman played Mayor Clarence Royce, the incumbent whom Carcetti planned to unseat.

Harris had a small role as Caroline Massey, a new officer in the Major Crimes Unit. The focus on Colvin's command of the Western District introduced several new characters both in Carver's Drug Enforcement Unit and in the Patrol Division. Carver's squad included Kenneth Dozerman (Rick Otto), Anthony Colicchio (Benjamin Busch), Lloyd \\"Truck\\" Garrick (Ryan Sands), and Lambert (Nakia Dillard). New rookie patrol officer Aaron Castor (Lee Everett Cox), Brian Baker (Derek Horton) and Officer Turner (Darrell M. Smith) also featured.

In Goa the fish is known as Kalundar In Sri Lanka this fish is known as Koraliya (‡∂ö‡∑ú‡∂ª‡∑Ö‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑è). It has been introduced in various parts of the world outside its native range, including Singapore, where it occurs in estuaries.Green Chromide. Guide to Common Marine Fishes of Singapore. This species and other members of the genus Etroplus are relatively closely related to the Paretroplus cichlids from Madagascar. Habitat and behavior The green chromide lives in brackish water habitat types, such as river deltas. It eats mainly aquatic plants, including filamentous algae and diatoms, but it consumes the occasional mollusk and other animal matter. This species engages in attentive parental care in which several adults care for each brood. Appearance The adult is oval in shape with a short snout. It is gray-green in color with dark barring and a dark spot at the base of the pectoral fin. It commonly reaches in length, and the maximum length is twice that. Relationship with humans Etroplus suratensis is a popular food fish and it is considered a delicacy.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service April 2011. Etroplus suratensis and E. maculatus form the main species and the former is dominant among Pearl spots in reservoirs of India. They mainly feed on detritus and occupy the same niche as that of Oreochromis mossambicus. These fishes are very popular food fishes but their biomass is very low in reservoirs compared to other cichlids. In 2010 this species was named the official state fish of Kerala. The following year was declared \\"The Year of the Karimeen\\". Karimeen Pollichatthu, a fried dish, is a delicacy served in restaurants. It is familiar to tourists, but because it is very expensive it is not easily accessible to poor folks. Production of the species for food is expected to increase in the near future.

They fall naturally into two geographical divisions: the northern group, consisting of E√Øao, Hatutu (Hatutaa), Motu One, and the islands centered on the large island of Nuku Hiva: Motu Iti (Hatu Iti), Ua Pou, Motu Oa and Ua Huka, and the southern group of Fatu Uku, Tahuata, Moho Tani (Motane), Terihi, Fatu Hiva and Motu Nao (Thomasset Rock), clustered around the main island of Hiva \`Oa. With a combined land area of 1,274 km¬≤ (492 sq. miles), the Marquesas are among the largest island groups of French Polynesia, Nuku Hiva being the second largest island in the entire territory, after Tahiti. With the exception of Motu One, all the islands of the Marquesas are of volcanic origin. In contrast to the common perception of lush tropical vegetation that goes culturally hand-in- hand with the appellation Polynesia, the Marquesas are remarkably dry islands. Although the islands lie within the tropics, they are the first major break in the prevailing easterly winds spawned from the extraordinarily dry (from an atmospheric perspective) Humboldt Current. The annual rainfall is generally around , but this average is misleading because of very high variability. In La Ni√±a years, rainfall can decline to less than , whilst in El Ni√±o years when the ocean warms it can reach . Unlike the rest of French Polynesia, most rain falls during the cooler months, with May to July usually the wettest and November the driest. Because of their exceptionally variable climate, the islands are subject to extreme drought and flood conditions. Only those that reach higher elevations (generally, above about 2,500 feet above sea level) have reliable precipitation. This has led to historical fluctuations in water supply, which has been a crucial factor in the sustainability of human populations in certain sections of the various islands throughout the archipelago. This is especially evident in the low historical population of Ua Huka (maximum elevation 2,812 ft.) and the intermittent inhabitability of Eiao (maximum elevation 1,890 ft.). The Marquesas Islands are thought to have formed from a center of upwelling magma called the Marquesas hotspot.

Since its beginning in 1973, the DJO has produced numerous notable recordings, two of which were Grammy nominated, and has performed internationally in concerts and jazz festivals, such as the Montreux Jazz Festival. Over the years, the orchestra has featured many of the most outstanding jazz players from the world class jazz program at the University of North Texas. Co-founder Galen Jeter is an alumnus of the University of North Texas One O'Clock Lab Band who played trumpet with the Woody Herman Orchestra.  Anniversary  The orchestra celebrated its thirtieth anniversary in October 2003. Jeter released a recording titled \\"The Big 3 ‚Äì 0.\\" In addition to its performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, DJO represented the United States at the World's Fair in Seville, Spain. The orchestra, under Jeter's leadership, has also entertained two United States presidents and accompanied numerous musical celebrities, including Diahann Carroll, Billy Eckstine, Doc Severinsen, Bob Hope, Steve Allen, Mel Torm√©, Joe Williams and the Four Freshmen.  Origin  In 1973, founders Thomas Mason and Galen Jeter brought together some of the best musicians from the Dallas area to form the Dallas Jazz Orchestra. With no outside financial support, the Dallas Jazz Orchestra played its first public concert in March 1974. The group's first album followed soon after, recorded live at Maxine Kent's in 1975. The second album, also cut live at Maxine Kent's, was produced in 1978. That same year, Galen moved the Dallas Jazz Orchestra into Wayne Morgan's Popsicle Toes where it played weekly for many years. Later the band played at Poor David's Pub on lower Greenville Avenue before settling at the Village Country Club.  Recordings and performances  Under Jeter's leadership, the Dallas Jazz Orchestra produced numerous additional albums that are programmed on more than 100 radio stations throughout the United States. To this day, Galen Jeter's DJO recordings are featured regularly on jazz radio all over the United States, Canada and Europe. Over more than three decades, Galen has invited hundreds of young talented musicians to join the Dallas Jazz Orchestra, drawing from the renowned jazz programs at the University of North Texas and other schools in the Dallas / Fort Worth Area. Many of the alumni of the DJO have gone on to join the ranks of bands led by well-known jazz greats such as Woody Herman, Buddy Rich, Ramsey Lewis, and Stan Kenton. DJO has concertized with numerous luminaries of the jazz world, including Lou Marini, Don Menza, Marvin Stamm, Tom Malone, Bobby Shew and many others.

Portuguese discoveries (Portuguese: Descobrimentos portugueses) are the numerous territories and maritime routes discovered by the Portuguese as a result of their intensive maritime exploration during the 15th and 16th centuries. Portuguese sailors were at the vanguard of European overseas exploration, discovering and mapping the coasts of Africa, Canada, Asia, and Brazil, in what became known as the Age of Discovery. Methodical expeditions started in 1419 along West Africa's coast under the sponsorship of prince Henry the Navigator, with Bartolomeu Dias reaching the Cape of Good Hope and entering the Indian Ocean in 1488. Ten years later, in 1498, Vasco da Gama led the first fleet around Africa to India, arriving in Calicut and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India. Portuguese explorations then proceeded to southeast Asia, where they reached Japan in 1542, forty-four years after their first arrival in India. In 1500, the Portuguese nobleman Pedro √Ålvares Cabral became the first European to discover Brazil. Origins Vasco da Gama lands in Calicut on May 20th 1498. In 1139 the Kingdom of Portugal achieved independence from Le√≥n, having doubled its area with the Reconquista under Afonso Henriques. In 1297, king Denis of Portugal took personal interest in the development of exports, having organized the export of surplus production to European countries. On May 10, 1293, he instituted a maritime insurance fund for Portuguese traders living in the County of Flanders, which were to pay certain sums according to tonnage, accrued to them when necessary. Wine and dried fruits from Algarve were sold in Flanders and England, salt from Set√∫bal and Aveiro was a profitable export to northern Europe, and leather and kermes, a scarlet dye, were also exported. Portuguese imported armors and munitions, fine clothes and several manufactured products from Flanders and Italy.A. R. de Oliveira Marques, Vitor Andre, \\"Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages\\", p.9, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1971, In 1317 king Denis made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor Manuel Pessanha (Pessagno), appointing him first Admiral with trade privileges with his homeland in return for twenty war ships and crews, with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids, thus laying the basis for the Portuguese Navy and establishment of a Genoese merchant community in Portugal.Diffie, Bailey (1977), Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580, p. 210, University of Minnesota Press. Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, the Republic of Genoa had turned to north African trade of wheat, olive oil (valued also as energy source) and a search for gold ‚Äì navigating also into the ports of Bruges (Flanders) and England. Genoese and Florentine communities established since then in Portugal, who profited from the enterprise and financial experience of these rivals of the Republic of Venice. In the second half of the fourteenth century outbreaks of bubonic plague led to severe depopulation: the economy was extremely localized in a few towns, and migration from the country led to agricultural land being abandoned, resulting in an increase in rural unemployment. Only the sea offered alternatives, with most people settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.M. D. D. Newitt, \\"A history of Portuguese overseas expansion, 1400‚Äì1668\\", p.9, Routledge, 2005, Between 1325‚Äì1357 Afonso IV of Portugal granted public funding to raise a proper commercial fleet and ordered the first maritime explorations, with the help of Genoese, under command of admiral Manuel Pessanha. In 1341 the Canary Islands, already known to Genoese, were officially discovered under the patronage of the Portuguese king, but in 1344 Castile disputed them, further propelling the Portuguese navy efforts.Butel, Paul, \\"The Atlantic\\", p. 36, Seas in history, Routledge, 1999 Atlantic exploration (1415‚Äì1488) Prince Henry the Navigator, generally credited as the driving force behind Portuguese maritime exploration. In 1415, Ceuta was occupied by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast, moved by expanding Christianity with the avail of the Pope and a desire of the unemployed nobility for epic acts of war after the reconquista. Young prince Henry the Navigator was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the Saharan trade routes. Governor of the rich Order of Christ since 1420 and holding valuable monopolies on resources in Algarve, he invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of Mauritania, gathering a group of merchants, shipowners, stakeholders and participants interested in the sea lanes. Later his brother Prince Pedro, granted him a royal monopoly of all profits from trading within the areas discovered. Soon the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1420) and Azores (1427) were reached. There, wheat and later sugarcane were cultivated, like in Algarve, by the Genoese, becoming profitable activities. This helped them become wealthier. Henry the Navigator took the lead role in encouraging Portuguese maritime exploration until his death in 1460.Diffie, p. 56 At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond Cape Bojador on the African coast. Henry wished to know how far the Muslim territories in Africa extended, and whether it was possible to reach Asia by sea, both to reach the source of the lucrative spice trade and perhaps to join forces with the long-lost Christian kingdom of Prester John that was rumoured to exist somewhere in the \\"Indies\\".Rafiuddin Shirazi, Tazkiratul Mulk.Anderson, p. 50 In 1419 two of Henry's captains, Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco and Trist√£o Vaz Teixeira were driven by a storm to Madeira, an uninhabited island off the coast of Africa which had probably been known to Europeans since the 14th century. In 1420 Zarco and Teixeira returned with Bartolomeu Perestrelo and began Portuguese settlement of the islands. A Portuguese attempt to capture Grand Canary, one of the nearby Canary Islands, which had been partially settled by Spaniards in 1402 was unsuccessful and met with protestations from Castile.Diffie, p. 57‚Äì58 Although the exact details are uncertain, cartographic evidence suggests the Azores were probably discovered in 1427 by Portuguese ships sailing under Henry's direction, and settled in 1432, suggesting that the Portuguese were able to navigate at least from the Portuguese coast.Diffie, p. 60 At around the same time as the unsuccessful attack on the Canary Islands, the Portuguese began to explore the North African coast. Sailors feared what lay beyond Cape Bojador, and whether it was possible to return once it was passed. In 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, Gil Eanes, passed this obstacle. Once this psychological barrier had been crossed, it became easier to probe further along the coast.Diffie, p. 68 Westward exploration continued over the same period: Diogo Silves discovered the Azores island of Santa Maria in 1427 and in the following years Portuguese discovered and settled the rest of the Azores. Within two decades of exploration, Portuguese ships bypassed the Sahara. The caravel ship introduced in the mid-15th century which aided Portuguese exploration Henry suffered a serious setback in 1437 after the failure of an expedition to capture Tangier, having encouraged his brother, King Edward, to mount an overland attack from Ceuta. The Portuguese army was defeated and only escaped destruction by surrendering Prince Ferdinand, the king's youngest brother.Anderson, p. 44 After the defeat at Tangier, Henry retired to Sagres on the southern tip of Portugal where he continued to direct Portuguese exploration until his death in 1460. In 1443 Prince Pedro, Henry's brother, granted him the monopoly of navigation, war and trade in the lands south of Cape Bojador. Later this monopoly would be enforced by the Papal bulls Dum Diversas (1452) and Romanus Pontifex (1455), granting Portugal the trade monopoly for the newly discovered countries, laying the basis for the Portuguese empire. A major advance which accelerated this project was the introduction of the caravel in the mid-15th century, a ship that could be sailed closer to the wind than any other in operation in Europe at the time.Boxer, p. 29 Using this new maritime technology, Portuguese navigators reached ever more southerly latitudes, advancing at an average rate of one degree a year.Russell-Wood, p. 9 Senegal and Cape Verde Peninsula were reached in 1445. The first feitoria trade post overseas was established then under Henry's directions, in 1445 on the island of Arguin off the coast of Mauritania, to attract Muslim traders and monopolize the business in the routes traveled in North Africa, starting the chain of Portuguese feitorias along the coast. In 1446, √Ålvaro Fernandes pushed on almost as far as present-day Sierra Leone and the Gulf of Guinea was reached in the 1460s. =Exploration after Prince Henry= An illustration of the padr√£o Diogo C√£o erected at Cape St. Mary, Angola. As a result of the first meager returns of the African explorations, in 1469 king Afonso V granted the monopoly of trade in part of the Gulf of Guinea to merchant Fern√£o Gomes, for an annual payment of 200,000 reals. Gomes was also required to explore of the coast each year for five years. He employed explorers Jo√£o de Santar√©m, Pedro Escobar, Lopo Gon√ßalves, Fern√£o do P√≥, and Pedro de Sintra, and exceeded the requirement. Under his sponsorship, Portuguese explorers crossed the Equator into the Southern Hemisphere and found the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. In 1471, Gomes' explorers reached Elmina on the Gold Coast (present day Ghana), and discovered a thriving gold trade between the natives and visiting Arab and Berber traders. Gomes established his own trading post there, which became known as ‚ÄúA Mina‚Äù (\\"The Mine\\"). Trade between Elmina and Portugal grew in the next decade. In 1481, the recently crowned Jo√£o II decided to build S√£o Jorge da Mina fort (Elmina Castle) and factory to protect this trade, which was then held again as a royal monopoly. In 1482, Diogo C√£o discovered the Congo River. In 1486, C√£o continued to Cape Cross, in present-day Namibia, near the Tropic of Capricorn. Iberian mare clausum claims during the Age of Discovery. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, disproving the view that had existed since Ptolemy that the Indian Ocean was separate from the Atlantic. Also at this time, P√™ro da Covilh√£ reached India via Egypt and Yemen, and visited Madagascar. He recommended further exploration of the southern route.Anderson, p. 59 As the Portuguese explored the coastlines of Africa, they left behind a series of padr√µes, stone crosses inscribed with the Portuguese coat of arms marking their claims,Newitt, p. 47 and built forts and trading posts. From these bases, the Portuguese engaged profitably in the slave and gold trades. Portugal enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the Atlantic slave trade for over a century, exporting around 800 slaves annually. Most were brought to the Portuguese capital Lisbon, where it is estimated black Africans came to constitute 10 percent of the population.Anderson, p. 55 =Tordesillas division of the world (1492)= The 1494 Tordesilhas Treaty meridian dividing the world between Portugal and Castille/Spain (purple) and the Moluccas antimeridian (green), set at the Treaty of Zaragoza, 1529 In 1492 Christopher Columbus's discovery for Spain of the New World, which he believed to be Asia, led to disputes between the Spanish and Portuguese. These were eventually settled by the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 which divided the world outside of Europe in an exclusive duopoly between the Portuguese and the Spanish, along a north‚Äìsouth meridian 370 leagues, or , west of the Cape Verde islands. However, as it was not possible at the time to correctly measure longitude, the exact boundary was disputed by the two countries until 1777.Diffie, p. 174 The completion of these negotiations with Spain is one of several reasons proposed by historians for why it took nine years for the Portuguese to follow up on Dias's voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, though it has also been speculated that other voyages were, in fact, taking place in secret during this time.Diffie, p. 176Boxer, p. 36 Whether or not this was the case, the long-standing Portuguese goal of finding a sea route to Asia was finally achieved in a ground-breaking voyage commanded by Vasco da Gama. =Reaching India and Brazil (1497‚Äì1500)= The route followed in Vasco da Gama's first voyage (1497‚Äì1499) The squadron of Vasco da Gama left Portugal in 1497, rounded the Cape and continued along the coast of East Africa, where a local pilot was brought on board who guided them across the Indian Ocean, reaching Calicut in western India in May 1498.Scammell, p. 13 The second voyage to India was dispatched in 1500 under Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. While following the same south-westerly route as Gama across the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral made landfall on the Brazilian coast. This was probably an accidental discovery, but it has been speculated that the Portuguese secretly knew of Brazil's existence and that it lay on their side of the Tordesillas line.McAlister, p. 75 Cabral recommended to the Portuguese King that the land be settled, and two follow up voyages were sent in 1501 and 1503. The land was found to be abundant in pau-brasil, or brazilwood, from which it later inherited its name, but the failure to find gold or silver meant that for the time being Portuguese efforts were concentrated on India.McAlister, p. 76 On 8 July 1497 the fleet, consisting of four ships and a crew of 170 men, left Lisbon The travel led by Vasco da Gama to Calicut was the starting point for deployment of Portuguese in the African east coast and in the Indian Ocean.Scammell, G.V. (1997). The First Imperial Age, European Overseas Expansion c. 1400‚Äì1715. Routledge. . The first contact occurred on 20 May 1498. After some conflict, he got an ambiguous letter for trade with the Zamorin of Calicut, leaving there some men to establish a trading post. Since then explorations lost private support, taking place under the exclusive patronage of the Portuguese Crown. Shortly after, the Casa da √çndia was established in Lisbon to administer the royal monopoly of navigation and trade. Indian Ocean explorations (1497‚Äì1542) The carrack Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai and other Portuguese Navy' ships in the 16th century. The aim of Portugal in the Indian Ocean was to ensure the monopoly of the spice trade. Taking advantage of the rivalries that pitted Hindus against Muslims, the Portuguese established several forts and trading posts between 1500 and 1510. In East Africa, small Islamic states along the coast of Mozambique, Kilwa, Brava, Sofala and Mombasa were destroyed, or became either subjects or allies of Portugal. P√™ro da Covilh√£ had reached Ethiopia, traveling secretly overland, as early as 1490; a diplomatic mission reached the ruler of that nation on October 19, 1520. In 1500 the second fleet to India who came to discover Brazil explored the East African coast, where Diogo Dias discovered the island that he named St. Lawrence, later known as Madagascar. This fleet, commanded by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, arrived at Calicut in September, where the first trade agreement in India was signed. For a short time a Portuguese factory was installed there, but was attacked by Muslims on December 16 and several Portuguese, including the scribe P√™ro Vaz de Caminha, died. After bombarding Calicut as a retaliation, Cabral went to rival Kochi. Profiting from the rivalry between the Maharaja of Kochi and the Zamorin of Calicut, the Portuguese were well received and seen as allies, getting a permit to build a fort (Fort Manuel) and a trading post that was the first European settlement in India. There in 1503 they built the St. Francis Church. In 1502 Vasco da Gama took the island of Kilwa on the coast of Tanzania, where in 1505 the first fort of Portuguese East Africa was built to protect ships from the East Indian trade. In 1505 king Manuel I of Portugal appointed Francisco de Almeida first Viceroy of Portuguese India for a three-year period, starting the Portuguese government in the east, headquartered at Kochi. That year the Portuguese conquered Kannur where they founded St. Angelo Fort. Louren√ßo de Almeida arrived in Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), where he discovered the source of cinnamon. Finding it divided into seven rival kingdoms, he established a defense pact with the kingdom of Kotte and extended the control in coastal areas, where in 1517 was founded the fortress of Colombo. In 1506 a Portuguese fleet under the command of Trist√£o da Cunha and Afonso de Albuquerque, conquered Socotra at the entrance of the Red Sea and Muscat in 1507, having failed to conquer Ormuz, following a strategy intended to close the entrances to the Indian Ocean. That same year, fortresses were built in the Island of Mozambique and Mombasa on the Kenyan coast. Madagascar was partly explored by Trist√£o da Cunha and in the same year Mauritius was discovered. The Portuguese in South Asia in the 16th & 17th centuries. Light Green - Territories conquered or ceded. Dark Green - Allies or under influence. Yellow - Main Factories In 1509, the Portuguese won the sea Battle of Diu against the combined forces of the Ottoman Sultan Beyazid II, Sultan of Gujarat, Maml√ªk Sultan of Cairo, Samoothiri Raja of Kozhikode, Venetian Republic, and Ragusan Republic (Dubrovnik). The Portuguese victory was critical for its strategy of control of the Indian Sea: Turks and Egyptians withdraw their navies from India, leaving the seas to the Portuguese, setting its trade dominance for almost a century, and greatly assisting the growth of the Portuguese Empire. It marked also the beginning of the European colonial dominance in Asia. A second Battle of Diu in 1538 finally ended Ottoman ambitions in India and confirmed Portuguese hegemony in the Indian Ocean. Under the government of Albuquerque, Goa was taken from the Bijapur sultanate in 1510 with the help of Hindu privateer Timoji. Coveted for being the best port in the region, mainly for the commerce of Arabian horses for the Deccan sultanates, it allowed to move on from the initial guest stay in Cochin. Despite constant attacks, Goa became the seat of the Portuguese government, under the name of Estado da India (State of India), with the conquest triggering compliance of neighbour kingdoms: Gujarat and Calicut sent embassies, offering alliances and grants to fortify. Albuquerque began that year in Goa the first Portuguese mint in India, taking the opportunity to announce the achievement.Indo-Portuguese Issues Indo-Portuguese Issues =Southeast Asia expeditions= Anonymous map c.1550 of Eastern Africa, Asia and Western Oceania In April 1511 Albuquerque sailed to Malacca in modern-day Malaysia, the most important eastern point in the trade network, where Malay met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic traders, described by Tom√© Pires as invaluable. The port of Malacca became then the strategic base for Portuguese trade expansion with China and Southeast Asia, under the Portuguese rule in India with its capital at Goa. To defend the city a strong fort was erected, called the \\"A Famosa\\", where one of its gates still remains today. Knowing of Siamese ambitions over Malacca, Albuquerque sent immediately Duarte Fernandes on a diplomatic mission to the kingdom of Siam (modern Thailand), where he was the first European to arrive, establishing amicable relations between both kingdoms. In November that year, getting to know the location of the so-called \\"Spice Islands\\" in the Moluccas, he sent an expedition led by Ant√≥nio de Abreu to find them, arriving in early 1512. Abreu went by Ambon while deputy commander Francisco Serr√£o came forward to Ternate, were a Portuguese fort was allowed. That same year, in Indonesia, the Portuguese took Makassar, reaching Timor in 1514. Departing from Malacca, Jorge √Ålvares came to southern China in 1513. This visit followed the arrival in Guangzhou, where trade was established. Later a trading post at Macau would be established. Monument to the Portuguese Discoveries in Bel√©m, Lisbon, Portugal. The Portuguese empire expanded into the Persian Gulf as Portugal contested control of the spice trade with the Ottoman Empire. In 1515, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered the Huwala state of Hormuz at the head of the Persian Gulf, establishing it as a vassal state. Aden, however, resisted Albuquerque's expedition in that same year, and another attempt by Albuquerque's successor Lopo Soares de Albergaria in 1516, before capturing Bahrain in 1521, when a force led by Ant√≥nio Correia defeated the Jabrid King, Muqrin ibn Zamil. In a shifting series of alliances, the Portuguese dominated much of the southern Persian Gulf for the next hundred years. With the regular maritime route linking Lisbon to Goa since 1497, the island of Mozambique became a strategic port, and there was built Fort S√£o Sebasti√£o and a hospital. In the Azores, the Islands Armada protected the ships en route to Lisbon. In 1525, after Fern√£o de Magalh√£es's expedition (1519‚Äì1522), Spain under Charles V sent an expedition to colonize the Moluccas islands, claiming that they were in his zone of the Treaty of Tordesillas, since there was not a set limit to the east. Garc√≠a Jofre de Loa√≠sa expedition reached the Moluccas, docking at Tidore. The conflict with the Portuguese already established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes. An agreement was reached only with the Treaty of Zaragoza (1529), attributing the Moluccas to Portugal and the Philippines to Spain. In 1530, John III organized the colonization of Brazil around 15 capitanias heredit√°rias (\\"hereditary captainships\\"), that were given to anyone who wanted to administer and explore them, to overcome the need to defend the territory, since an expedition under the command of Gon√ßalo Coelho in 1503, found the French making incursions on the land. That same year, there was a new expedition from Martim Afonso de Sousa with orders to patrol the whole Brazilian coast, banish the French, and create the first colonial towns: S√£o Vicente on the coast, and S√£o Paulo on the border of the altiplane. From the 15 original captainships, only two, Pernambuco and S√£o Vicente, prospered. With permanent settlement came the establishment of the sugar cane industry and its intensive labor demands which were met with Native American and later African slaves. In 1534 Gujarat was occupied by the Mughals and the Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was forced to sign the Treaty of Bassein (1534) with the Portuguese, establishing an alliance to regain the country, giving in exchange Daman, Diu, Mumbai and Bassein. In 1538 the fortress of Diu is again surrounded by Ottoman ships. Another siege failed in 1547 putting an end to the Ottoman ambitions, confirming the Portuguese hegemony. Portuguese ruler of Pegu riding an Elephant. In 1542 Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier arrived in Goa at the service of king John III of Portugal, in charge of an Apostolic Nunciature. At the same time Francisco Zeimoto, Ant√≥nio Mota, and other traders arrived in Japan for the first time. According to Fern√£o Mendes Pinto, who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at Tanegashima, where the locals were impressed by firearms, which would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale. In 1557 the Chinese authorities allowed the Portuguese to settle in Macau through an annual payment, creating a warehouse in the triangular trade between China, Japan and Europe. In 1570 the Portuguese bought a Japanese port where they founded the city of Nagasaki, thus creating a trading center for many years was the port from Japan to the world. Portugal established trading ports at far-flung locations like Goa, Ormuz, Malacca, Kochi, the Maluku Islands, Macau, and Nagasaki. Guarding its trade from both European and Asian competitors, Portugal dominated not only the trade between Asia and Europe, but also much of the trade between different regions of Asia, such as India, Indonesia, China, and Japan. Jesuit missionaries, such as the Basque Francis Xavier, followed the Portuguese to spread Roman Catholic Christianity to Asia with mixed success. Map of Portuguese discoveries and explorations (1415‚Äì1543) Portuguese discoveries and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese spice trade routes in the Indian Ocean (blue); territories claimed during King John III rule (c. 1536) (green); Main Factorys (orange) Portuguese nautical science The successive expeditions and experience of the pilots led to a fairly rapid evolution of Portuguese nautical science, creating an elite of astronomers, navigators, mathematicians and cartographers, among them stood Pedro Nunes with studies on how to determine the latitudes by the stars and Jo√£o de Castro. = Ships = Portuguese \\"Armada\\" fleet in 1507, Lisuarte de Abreu Until the 15th century, the Portuguese were limited to cabotage navigation using barques and (ancient cargo vessels used in the Mediterranean). These boats were small and fragile, with only one mast with a fixed quadrangular sail and did not have the capabilities to overcome the navigational difficulties associated with southward oceanic exploration, as the strong winds, shoals and strong ocean currents easily overwhelmed their abilities. They are associated with the earliest discoveries, such as the Madeira Islands, the Azores, the Canaries, and to the early exploration of the northwest African coast as far south as Arguim in the current Mauritania. The ship that truly launched the first phase of the Portuguese discoveries along the African coast was the caravel, a development based on existing fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts, with lateen triangular sails allowing luffing. The caravel benefited from a greater capacity to tack. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Among the famous caravels are Berrio and Anuncia√ß√£o. With the start of long oceanic sailing also large ships developed. \\"Nau\\" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily merchant ships. Due to the piracy that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the navy and were provided with canon windows, which led to the classification of \\"naus\\" according to the power of its artillery. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade: from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500, they become impressive in the 16th century, having usually two decks, stern castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century there were also used carracks, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2000 tons. = Celestial navigation = Ephemeris by Abraham Zacuto in Almanach Perpetuum, 1496 In the thirteenth century celestial navigation was already known, guided by the sun position. For celestial navigation the Portuguese, like other Europeans, used Arab navigation tools, like the astrolabe and quadrant, which they made easier and simpler. They also created the cross-staff, or cane of Jacob, for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The Southern Cross become a reference upon arrival at the Southern hemisphere by Jo√£o de Santar√©m and Pedro Escobar in 1471, starting the celestial navigation on this constellation. But the results varied throughout the year, which required corrections. To this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables (Ephemeris), precious tools for oceanic navigation, which have experienced a remarkable diffusion in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing to calculate latitude. The tables of the Almanach Perpetuum, by astronomer Abraham Zacuto, published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by Vasco da Gama and Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. =Sailing techniques= Map of the five major oceanic gyres Besides coastal exploration, Portuguese also made trips off in the ocean to gather meteorological and oceanographic information (in these were discovered the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores, and Sargasso Sea). The knowledge of wind patterns and currents ‚Äì the trade winds and the oceanic gyres in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the latitude of the Azores, using the permanent favorable winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of atmospheric circulation and the effect of Coriolis, facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese venturing increasingly farther from shore, the maneuver that became known as \\"Volta do mar\\". In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish discovering the Manila Galleon trade route. =Cartography= Pre-mercator navigation chart of the Coast of Africa (1571), by Fern√£o Vaz Dourado (Torre do Tombo, Lisbon) It is thought that Jehuda Cresques, son of the Catalan cartographer Abraham Cresques has been one of the notable cartographers at the service of Prince Henry. However, the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by Pedro Reinel in 1485 representing Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by Diogo C√£o. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of latitudes in 1504 and the first representation of a Wind rose. With his son, cartographer Jorge Reinel and Lopo Homem, they participated in the making of the atlas known as \\"Lopo Homem-Rein√©s Atlas\\" or \\"Miller Atlas\\", in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time, with Emperor Charles V wanting them to work for him. In 1517 King Manuel I of Portugal handed Lopo Homem a charter giving him the privilege to certify and amend all compass needles in vessels. In the third phase of the former Portuguese nautical cartography, characterized by the abandonment of the influence of Ptolemy's representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents, stands out Fern√£o Vaz Dourado (Goa ~ 1520 ‚Äì ~ 1580), giving him a reputation as one of the best cartographers of the time. Many of his charts are large scale.  Chronology  *1147‚ÄîVoyage of the Adventurers.

Besides Magellan, also participated in the trip Diogo and Duarte Barbosa, Jo√£o Serr√£o, √Ålvaro de Mesquita (Magellan's nephew), the pilots Jo√£o Rodrigues de Carvalho and Est√™v√£o Gomes, Henrique of Malacca, among others. Many of them cross almost all longitudes or all longitudes reaching the Philippines, Borneo and the Moluccas, because they had previously visited India, Mallacca, the Indonesian Archipelago or the Moluccas (1511-1512), like Ferdinand Magellan in the 7th Portuguese India Armada under the command of Francisco de Almeida and on the expeditions of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, Afonso de Albuquerque and his other voyages, sailing eastward from Lisbon (as Magellan in 1505), and then later, in 1521, sailing westward from Seville, reaching that longitude and region once again and then proceeding still further west. *1525‚ÄîAleixo Garcia explored the Rio de la Plata in service to Spain as a member of the expedition of Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s in 1516. Sol√≠s had left Portugal towards Castile (Spain) in 1506 and would be financed by Christopher de Haro, who had served Manuel I of Portugal until 1516. Serving Charles I of Spain after 1516, Haro believed that Lisboa and Frois had discovered a major route in the Southern New World to west or a strait to Asia two years earlier. Later (when returning and after a shipwreck on the coast of Brazil), from Santa Catarina, Brazil, and leading an expedition of some European and 2,000 Guaran√≠ Indians, Aleixo Garcia explored Paraguay and Bolivia using the trail network Peabiru. Aleixo Garcia was the first European to cross the Chaco and even managed to penetrate the outer defenses of the Inca Empire on the hills of the Andes (near Sucre), in present-day Bolivia. He was the first European to do so, accomplishing this eight years before Francisco Pizarro. *1525‚ÄîDiogo da Rocha and his pilot Gomes de Sequeira reached Celebes and were blown off course and driven three hundred leagues in a direction constantly towards the east and to Ilhas de Gomes de Sequeira - most probably the Palau Island or Yap, (Caroline Islands) according to the geographical notes, distance traveled and physical description of the natives in D√©cadas da √Åsia of Jo√£o de Barros, or, according to the alleged existence of gold mentioned by the natives, other descriptions of the people and if they were to south and east in one or two voyages made by Gomes de Sequeira (According to the different interpretations of the Chronicles of Barros, Castanheda and Galv√£o), raises also the hypothesis of Cape York Peninsula in Australia, maybe one of the Prince of Wales Islands. In Gastald's map a group of islands named Insul de gomes des queria lie in about 8 degrees of south latitude and in the longitude of the Northern Territory of Australia. In the same map the Apem insul seems to correspond with either Adi Island or the Aru Islands. The (Islands of the White Men) correspond, as far as locality is concerned, to the Arru (Aru) Islands. It would appear then that Gomes de Sequeira's Islands, which are the south-easternmost of those represented, must correspond with the Timor Laut group. In the same year, according to the voyages to the Banda Islands mentioned on Decadas and according to contemporaneous cartographers, Martim Afonso de Melo (Jusarte) and Garcia Henriques explored the Tanimbar Islands (the archipelago labelled \\"aqui invernou Martim Afonso de Melo\\" and \\"Aqui in bernon Martin Afonso de melo\\" [Here wintered Martin Afonso de Melo]) and probably the Aru Islands (the two archipelagos and the navigator mentioned in the maps of L√°zaro Lu√≠s, 1563, Bartolomeu Velho, c. 1560, Sebasti√£o Lopes, c. 1565 and also in the 1594 map of the East Indies entitled Insulce Molucoe by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius and in the map of Nova Guinea of 1600). *1526‚ÄîDiscovery of New Guinea by Jorge de Meneses *1528‚ÄîDiogo Rodrigues explores the Mascarene islands, that he names after his countryman Pedro Mascarenhas, he explored and named the islands of R√©union, Mauritius, and RodriguesJos√© Nicolau da Fonseca, Historical and Archaeological Sketch of the City of Goa, Bombay : Thacker, 1878, pp. 47‚Äì48.

The Nau S√£o Paulo, who also carried women and had sailed from Europe and had scale in Brazil, would be the protagonist of a dramatic and moving story of survival after sinking south of Sumatra. *1560‚ÄîGon√ßalo da Silveira, Jesuit missionary, travelled up the Zambezi River, on his expedition to the capital of the Monomotapa which appears to have been the N'Pande kraal, close by the M'Zingesi River, a southern tributary of the Zambezi.

It introduces Baltimore's school system and several middle school students while continuing to examine the remnants of the Barksdale Organization, the ascendant Stanfield Organization, the Baltimore Police Department and politicians. The fourth season aired on Sundays at 9:00 pm ET in the United States. The season was released on DVD as a four disc boxed set under the title of The Wire: The Complete Fourth Season on December 4, 2007 by HBO Video. Production =Crew= Playwright and television writer/producer Eric Overmyer joined the crew for the show's fourth season as a consulting producer and writer. He had previously worked on Homicide and was brought into the full-time production staff to replace George Pelecanos who scaled back his involvement in order to concentrate on his next book and he worked on the fourth season solely as a writer. David Mills, Emmy-award winner, Homicide and The Corner writer and college friend of Simon, joined the writing staff in the fourth season. Regular writer Ed Burns became a producer on The Wire in this season. =Cast= The focus of the fourth season shifted between a local school, the mayoral election, police department politics and action on the street corners. The returning starring cast consisted of Dominic West as Officer Jimmy McNulty, the formerly insubordinate detective who attempts to shed his ability and his problems in favor of a better life. West was at the time homesick and wanting to spend time with his young daughter in England; he also felt the character's plot arc had reached a reasonable end point in season 3, so West arranged with the writers for McNulty's role to be greatly reduced in Season 4. Lance Reddick reprised his role as newly promoted Major Cedric Daniels, now commanding the western district. One of Daniels's sergeants within the district was Sergeant Ellis Carver, portrayed by Seth Gilliam. Robert Wisdom reprised his role as former western district commander Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin, who has become a field researcher after a short stint working in hotel security following his retirement from the Baltimore Police Department. The Major Crimes Unit saw a shift in personnel this season. Kima Greggs, portrayed by Sonja Sohn, and Lester Freamon, portrayed by Clarke Peters, transferred to the Homicide Unit after the new lieutenant of the Major Crimes Unit ends the wire and halts Freamon's investigation of the Barksdale money. Corey Parker-Robinson portrayed Detective Leander Sydnor, one of two detectives who remain in the Major Crimes Unit after the arrival of the new lieutenant. Domenick Lombardozzi returned as Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk, a former member of the Major Crimes Unit whose work on the mayor's security detail earns him a promotion to sergeant and a transfer back to his old unit after Freamon and Greggs' departure. Wendell Pierce portrayed veteran homicide detective Bunk Moreland. Deirdre Lovejoy starred as assistant state's attorney Rhonda Pearlman, the legal liaison between the unit and the courthouse. Andre Royo returned as Bubbles, who continued to indulge his drug addiction and act as an occasional informant. Jim True-Frost portrayed Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski, a former member of the Major Crimes Unit who has become a teacher in an inner city school after inadvertently killing a fellow officer in season three. The police were overseen by two commanding officers more concerned with politics and their own careers than the case, Deputy Commissioner of Operations William Rawls (John Doman) and Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison). At city hall, Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen) was an ambitious city councilman seeking to become mayor. Joining the cast for the fourth season was Reg E. Cathey as Carcetti's deputy campaign manager, Norman Wilson. Also joining the cast after having a recurring role during the third season was Glynn Turman as Mayor Clarence Royce. On the streets, former Barksdale crew chief Bodie Broadus (J.D. Williams) joined the organization of new drug kingpin Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector). Michael K. Williams portrayed renowned stick-up man Omar Little. Joining the cast this season after having a recurring role in season three is Chad L. Coleman as Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise, a reformed member of the Barksdale organization who has opened a boxing gym for neighborhood children. Two members of the third season starring cast did not return for the fourth season following the termination of their characters' storylines. Both Wood Harris (Avon Barksdale) and Idris Elba (Stringer Bell) left the starring cast in the final episode of the third season. Recurring characters Many guest stars from the earlier seasons reprised their roles. Proposition Joe (Robert F. Chew), the East Side's cautious drug kingpin, became more cooperative with the Stanfield Organization following the death of Stringer Bell. His lieutenant, and nephew, \\"Cheese\\" (Method Man) continued to elude the Major Crimes Unit investigation. Hassan Johnson reprises his role as incarcerated Barksdale enforcer Wee-Bey Brice. Former Barksdale enforcer Slim Charles (Anwan Glover) returned as a new recruit to Proposition Joe's organization. Several members of the Stanfield Organization introduced in season three also returned: Chris Partlow (Gbenga Akinnagbe), Stanfield's chief enforcer; and Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson (Felicia Pearson), Partlow's prot√©g√©. Tray Chaney continues to portray former Barksdale crew chief Poot Carr, who joins the Stanfield organization this season. Michael Hyatt reprised her role as Brianna Barksdale. Michael Kostroff returned as the defence attorney Maurice Levy. Isiah Whitlock, Jr. reprised his role as corrupt State Senator Clay Davis whose involvement with Barksdale money causes him trouble with the Major Crimes Unit. Omar Little's crew shifted focus to the Stanfield Organization and the New Day Co-op and consisted of his new boyfriend Renaldo (Ram√≥n Rodr√≠guez), partner Kimmy (Kelli R. Brown), and advisor Butchie (S. Robert Morgan). Many guest stars also reprised their characters from the police department. Returning guest stars in the homicide unit included Delaney Williams as Sergeant Jay Landsman, Ed Norris as Detective Ed Norris, and Brian Anthony Wilson as Detective Vernon Holley. Al Brown and Jay Landsman reprised their roles as Major Stan Valchek and Lieutenant Dennis Mello. Michael Salconi recurred as veteran Western patrolman Michael Santangelo. Gregory L. Williams played Michael Crutchfield, a cantankerous homicide detective. Joilet F. Harris returned as Caroline Massey, an officer in the Major Crimes Unit.

In the political storyline, Cleo Reginald Pizana returned as Coleman Parker, Royce's chief-of-staff. Brandy Burre appeared as Theresa D'Agostino, a political campaign consultant. Frederick Strother performed as Odell Watkins, a state delegate and political king-maker. Christopher Mann played Carcetti's city council colleague Anthony Gray. Maria Broom returns as Marla Daniels, the estranged wife of Major Daniels who is running for a seat on the city council. The fourth season also saw the return of two former starring characters from the second season: Amy Ryan as Officer Beadie Russell, an officer at the port and Jimmy McNulty's domestic partner, and Paul Ben-Victor as Spiros Vondas, the second in command of the Greek's drug smuggling operation. The shift of focus to the schools saw the introduction of four young actors in major recurring roles this season: Jermaine Crawford as Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems; Maestro Harrell as Randy Wagstaff; Julito McCullum as Namond Brice; and Tristan Wilds as Michael Lee. The characters are friends from a West Baltimore middle school. Other new characters from the school included Tootsie Duvall as Assistant Principal Marcia Donnelly; David Parenti (Dan DeLuca), a Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland who works with Bunny Colvin in the school to study potential violent offenders; Stacie Davis portrayed Miss Duquette, a doctoral student who works with Parenti and Colvin; Aaron \\"Bug\\" Manigault (Keenon Brice), Michael Lee's younger brother; Kenard (Thuliso Dingwall), one of the younger members of Namond Brice's circle of friends; and Richard Hidlebird as Principal Claudell Withers.

La Falaise was allegedly baptised not with holy water but with Shocking, the scent by fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, her mother's employer. After her parents' divorce in 1950, following her mother's infidelities and a French court's declaration of her as an unfit mother, Loulou and her brother went to live with foster families until she was seven.Alicia Drake, The Beautiful Fall (Hachette Digital, 2007), retrieved via Google Books on 5 November 2011 After that, La Falaise was enrolled in English boarding schools, and \\"her school holidays were shared between mother, father, and the second foster family\\".

Another uncle, her father's elder brother, was Henri de La Falaise, Marquis de La Coudraye, (1898‚Äì1972), film director and third husband of American actress Gloria Swanson (1899‚Äì1983). Her paternal grandfather was a three-time French Olympic gold medallist in fencing, Louis Gabriel de La Falaise (1866‚Äì1910).

Eventually, she moved to Paris, where she joined his haute-couture firm in 1972. Responding to a description of her as a Saint Laurent muse in 2010, La Falaise responded, \\"For me, a muse is someone who looks glamorous but is quite passive, whereas I was very hard-working. I worked from 9am to sometimes 9pm, or even 2am. I certainly wasn't passive.\\" \\"Her official task was to bring her eccentric style to accessories and jewellery, and she duly came up with often-chunky designs incorporating large colourful stones, enamel work or rock crystal\\". La Falaise also inspired Saint Laurent with her inventive wardrobe: \\"one week she was Desdemona in purple velvet flares and a crown of flowers, the next Marlene [Dietrich] with plucked crescent-shaped eyebrows\\". In 2002, when Saint Laurent retired, La Falaise began producing her own clothing and jewellery designs. As reported in The New York Times by fashion writer Cathy Horyn, \\"The clothing line captured much of her rare taste‚Äîwell-cut blazers in the best English tweeds, French sailor pants in linen, striped silk blouses with cheeky black lace edging, masculine walking coats with fur linings, and gorgeous knits in perfectly chosen colors\\". She also designed cloisonn√© boxes and porcelain vases for Asiatides,http://www.asiatides.com/products_creativity.html# as well as jewellery for the boutique of the Majorelle Garden in Marrakech, Morocco. After more than three decades designing jewellery and accessories for Saint Laurent, La Falaise launched her own fashion business, designing ready-to- wear, costume jewellery, and accessories, which were retailed in the U.S. as well as two Loulou de La Falaise shops in Paris. She sold simplified versions of her jewellery designs in a line created for the Home Shopping Network and created costume jewellery for Oscar de la Renta. She operated two of her own shops in Paris, one of which was designed by her brother, Alexis. Marriages On 6 October 1966, she married Desmond FitzGerald, 29th Knight of Glin (1937-2011), an Irish nobleman. They separated the following year and divorced in 1970. Her title upon marrying the knight was Madam FitzGerald. On 11 June 1977, she married Thad√©e Klossowski de Rola, a French writer, who is the younger son of the painter Balthus in Paris, France. She wore a harem-and- turban ensemble from Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche. They had one child: Anna Klossowski de Rola, co-founder of the contemporary art collection called \\"MGM.\\" Death La Falaise died at Gisors' hospital, France, on 5 November 2011. The cause was not specified, other than as the result of a \\"long illness\\". An obituary published in Women's Wear Daily stated, \\"According to sources, de la Falaise was diagnosed with lung cancer last June, but implored intimates to keep her health a private matter\\".

Medical students in Germany, Austria and Switzerland carry this title during their medical studies before being awarded the degree of Dr.med. (Germany) or Dr.med.univ. (Austria) after defending a doctoral or diploma thesis before a jury. Defence of a thesis is optional in Germany and can be prepared during or after the medical studies, while in Austria it is compulsory to defend a thesis before completion of the medical curriculum. The degree can also be written as candidatus/candidata medicin√¶ (√Ü instead of AE). In Danish and Norwegian, the degree is, similar to other Latin degrees, generally not capitalized (i.e. it's written as candidatus/candidata medicinae and abbreviated cand.med.). The abbreviation of the Latin term is almost exclusively used, i.e. they are not translated. The term candidate refers to those running for public office in Ancient Rome. Traditionally, many doctors (and lawyers) in Denmark and Norway would hold positions directly appointed by the King. In Denmark and Norway, a higher doctorate of medicine is known as dr.med. (doctor medicinae, literally, Doctor of Medicine). This degree is obtained by those furthering their career in research and is not required or usually obtained by those only working in clinical medicine. Formally it is not, however, required in Denmark to hold a cand.med. degree to acquire the doctorate. In practice most Doctors of Medicine are also Candidates of Medicine. In Denmark there are currently two research degrees that can be obtained in the field of medicine, the ph.d., which is not officially a doctorate (although being called the lesser doctorate informally) and the doctorate, dr.med. (informally the higher doctorate). Dr.med. was abolished in Norway in 2008 and replaced by the PhD. Norway In Norway the education is offered at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, University of Bergen, University of Oslo, and University of Troms√∏. Enrollment in a program leading to a medical degree is highly competitive in Norway. The required grades obtained in secondary education are consistently higher for medical degrees than for any other university subject. Following the education, candidates are permitted to work as a doctor and obtain the title cand.med. In order to obtain a clinical specialization (for example general surgery, internal medicine, general practice etc) a cand.med must start as a rotation doctor, first at a hospital for one year and then six months as a general practitioner. During such rotation the candidate hold the title LIS-1. After the rotation service, the candidate med continue more specific training for the specific specialization and hold the title LIS-2. The first Norwegian to receive this degree was Carl Schultz in 1817. Along with the cand.med.vet., cand.psychol. and cand.theol. it is one of the few Latin titles to survive the \\"Quality Reform\\" in Norway. Medical students In Norway, the term stud.med. (abbreviation of the Latin studiosus medicinae (masculine) or studiosa medicinae (feminine)) is used to denote medical students that are in their final year of medical-school and have acquired a licence to practice medicine under the guidance of a more experienced doctor. Other uses In Finland, Germany and Switzerland, the term cand. med. is commonly used to denote a medical student in a six-year program who has passed the First Medical State Examination after two years of pre-clinical study and has entered the clinical part.

It was originally published in 1921, so it is in the public domain.Bates, p. 139 Librivox has made the poem available in voice recording in its The Complete Public Domain Poems of Wallace Stevens. Interpretation Leiter deems this poem one of Stevens's \\"most impenetrable\\" poems, containing \\"oxymoronic images\\" whose conflicting meanings must be held in abeyance. (This may not be far from the \`Wilson effect' mentioned in the main Harmonium essay.) Bates compares the poem to Infanta Marina as a model of Stevens's use of a symbol to invest a landscape with his feeling for it. The aura of mystery that is characteristic of Stevens's naturalistic studies is evident here in the parakeet's brooding, his pure intellect applying its laws, and his exertion of his will. Compare The Curtains in the House of the Metaphysician for another expression of Stevens's enigmatic naturalism. By contrast, Paul Mariani in his biography of Stevens has referred to the poem as among the 'darkest' among the poet's criticisms of religion.Mariani, Paul. The Whole Harmonium: The Life of Wallace Stevens ‚Äì April 5, 2016. Pages 101-121.

This is often an attempt to gain more money than the value given when surrendering the policy to the original life assurance company. Background With-profits endowment policies were aggressively sold for many years, especially during the late 1980s and early 1990s, by UK insurance companies. The policies were marketed as an almost guaranteed way to pay off a mortgage and leave the policy holder with a lump sum once it had matured. The with profits endowment policy was sold alongside an interest only mortgage. By only paying interest, mortgage repayments were kept low. However, in addition the mortgage holder had to pay monthly premiums on their endowment which ran for the term of the mortgage, typically 25 years. The insurance company would invest most of the premium into their with profits fund, which in turn would invest in a balanced portfolio of largely UK based stocks, shares, property and fixed interest assets. A small amount of the premium was used to provide life cover for the policy holder. The aim was that the return on the with profits endowment would be in excess of the mortgage interest over the term of the mortgage. Hence, the mortgage holder would effectively create a leveraged investment that would aim to repay the mortgage sooner, and\\\\or provide a surplus. The projected endowment returns used in selling these types of products was often in excess of 10%pa. As these levels of return have not been achieved over recent years, many endowments are currently maturing (or are projected to mature) with a significant shortfall. This has led to endowment misselling compensation claims being made in the UK. Surrendering vs. selling When it became apparent that many policies would not cover the cost of the mortgage loan, policy holders sought alternative methods to repay their mortgage and dispose of their endowment policies. Whilst initially, the only method was to surrender (cancel) the policy with the life assurance company themselves, obtaining the surrender value calculated by them, a second hand market slowly developed, providing policyholders with much added value over their surrender values. Typical market prices in 2013 are 5-6% above the surrender value of the policy. Now, many companies offer to buy the with profits endowment policy from the holder for more than the surrender value. This practice has created a thriving industry of endowment policy buyers. Members of the public can either contact these companies directly or they can use the services of a Traded Endowment Specialist. Traded Endowment Specialists are companies that deal exclusively with Second Hand Endowment Policies and obtain offers from the entire market. They can also provide offers from some buyers that do not purchase directly from the public and will only offer through these Traded Endowment Specialists. Not all purchase offers are the same as some buyers will purchase on a 'guaranteed-offer' basis whilst others will make initial offers that are subject to sale. These offers are not guaranteed as there is no definite purchaser in place. Yet other companies retain the right to revalue or cancel their offer at their discretion throughout the sale. A Traded Endowment Specialist can assist you in understanding the nature of the different offers you receive - making sure you don't end up with an offer that is not suitable for your circumstances.

(Shqiptaria or Shqiptarizmi) and Pan-Albanianism,. \\"... form a 'Greater Albania'. Although considerable attention was given to pan-Albanianism in the West\\". (Panshqiptarizmi) that includes ideas on the creation of a geographically expanded Albanian state or a Greater Albania encompassing adjacent Balkan lands with substantial Albanian populations. During the late Ottoman period Albanians were mainly Muslims with close ties to the Ottoman Empire. The lack of previous Albanian statehood to draw upon resulted in Albanian nationalism developing later unlike neighbouring nationalisms of the Serbs and Greeks. The onset of the Eastern crisis (1870s) that threatened partition of Balkan Albanian inhabited lands by neighbouring Orthodox Christian states stimulated the emergence of the Rilindja period and nationalist movement.. During the 19th century, some Western scholarly influences, Albanian diasporas such as the Arb√´resh and Albanian National Awakening figures contributed greatly to spreading influences and ideas among Balkan Albanians within the context of Albanian self-determination. Among those were ideas of an Illyrian contribution to Albanian ethnogenesis which still dominate Albanian nationalism in contemporary times and other ancient peoples claimed as ancestors, in particular the Pelasgians which have been claimed again in recent times.. Due to overlapping and competing territorial claims with other Balkan nationalisms and states over land dating from the late Ottoman period, these ideas comprise a national myth that aim to establish precedence over neighbouring peoples (Slavs and Greeks) and allow movements for independence and self- determination, as well as irredentist claims against neighbouring countries.. \\"Albanians tended to go further back in time to the sixth and seventh centuries, claiming an Illyrian- Albanian continuity and superiority over Slavic people....\\". \\"by identifying with Pelasgians, Albanians could claim that they were present in their Balkan homeland not only before the \\"barbarian\\" invaders of late Roman times (such as the Slavs), not only before the Romans themselves, but also, even more importantly, before the Greeks‚Äü (Malcolm 2002: 76-77).\\" Pan-Albanian sentiments are also present and historically have been achieved only once when part of Kosovo and western Macedonia was united by Axis Italian forces to their protectorate of Albania during the Second World War. Albanian nationalism contains a series of myths relating to Albanian origins, cultural purity and national homogeneity, religious indifference as the basis of Albanian national identity, and continuing national struggles.. The figure of Skanderbeg is one of the main constitutive myths of Albanian nationalism that is based on a person, as other myths are based on ideas, abstract concepts, and collectivism.. \\"three main constitutive myths at work within Albanian nationalism ...Secondly, the myth of Skanderbeg, ...\\".. \\"Betrachtet man die Gesamtheit der albanischen Nationalmythen, so ist offensichtlich, dass es fur Albaner mehr als nur den Skanderbeg-Mythos gibt und dass nicht nur auf diesem Mythos die albanische Identitat beruht. Es gibt noch weitere wichtige Mythenfiguren, doch diese beziehen sich auf Vorstellungen, abstrakte Konzepte und Kollektive, aber nicht auf Personen.\\"  History  = Background = Group photo of some Prizren League delegates (1878) Some authors argue that Albanian nationalism, unlike its Greek and Serbian counterparts has its origins in a different historical context that did not emerge from an anti-Ottoman struggle and instead dates to the period of the Eastern Crisis (1878) and threat of territorial partition by Serbs and Greeks, while others hold views that Albanian nationalism emerged earlier as a societal reform movement that turned into a geopolitical one in response to the events of 1878, reacting against both the policies of Ottoman rule and those of rival Balkan nationalisms. Competing with neighbours for contested areas forced Albanians to make their case for nationhood and seek support from European powers.. Some scholars disagree with the view that Albanian nationalism emerged in 1878 or argue that the paradigm of setting a specific start date is wrongRrapaj, Jonilda and Kolasi, Klevis (2013). The Turkish Yearbook of International Relations, Volume 44, pages 185-228. Page 194-195: \\"The initial or Phase A consists in the intellectual interest and scholarly inquiry of an awareness of the linguistic, cultural and social attributes of the particular ethnic group. No clear national demands (for independence) exists in this stage. The second period or Phase B concerns the patriotic activities of elites to ‚Äúawaken‚Äù national consciousness among the ethnic group or the period of patriotic agitation. The final stage or Phase C denotes the transformation of nationalists movements from a narrow one restricted with political and intellectual circles into a mass movement.25 In the Albanian case as we will see below, we can argue that Phase A, generally speaking covers the period from the beginning of the Reforms of Tanzimat or the publication of first the Albanian alphabet in 1844 as a symbolic date, until the collapse of the League of Prizren (1881) or the publication of Sami Frash√´ri‚Äüs nationalist Manifest in 1899, while Phase B intensifies after the crushing of the League of Prizren by the Sublime Porte and especially after the Greek-Ottoman crisis in 1897. It continues even after the declaration of independence, because of the fragile or gelatinous state structure. The spread of nationalism to masses or the Phase C starts only with the establishment of a proper state structure and political stability after 1920.\\"Hroch, Miroslav (1999). ‚ÄúFrom National Movement to the Fully-formed Nation: The Nation- building Process in Europe‚Äù, in Mapping the Nation', ed.

Page 24: \\"It is assumed that the beginning of the Albanian Revival was set by Naum Veqilharxhi's activity and his address to the Orthodox Albanians, which, along with his primer published in 1845, was the first programme document of the Albanian national movement. In it Veqilharxhi demanded Albanian schools and development of the Albanian language as a first step to the evolution of the Albanian people side by side with the other Balkan nations\\", but those events are widely considered a pivotal moment that led to the politicization of the Albanian national movement and the emergence of myths being generated that became part of the mythology of Albanian nationalism that is expressed in contemporary times within Albanian collective culture and memory. That historical context also made the Albanian national movement defensive in outlook as nationalists sought national affirmation and to counter what they viewed as the erosion of national sentiments and language.. By the 19th century Albanians were divided into three religious groups. Catholic Albanians had some Albanian ethno-linguistic expression in schooling and church due to Austro-Hungarian protection and Italian clerical patronage. Orthodox Albanians under the Patriarchate of Constantinople had liturgy and schooling in Greek and toward the late Ottoman period mainly identified with Greek national aspirations.. \\"The political thinking of the Orthodox Albanians was divided into two categories. Those who lived in Albania were dominated by Greek influence. The majority of them- especially the notables-desired union with Greece. The Orthodox Christians in general had an intense hatred of Ottoman rule. Although this feeling was shared by their co-religionists who lived in the colonies abroad, their political thinking was different.\\". para. 2, 27. Muslim Albanians during this period formed around 70% of the overall Balkan Albanian population in the Ottoman Empire with an estimated population of more than a million. = Eastern Crisis and Albanian National Awakening = . With the rise of the Eastern Crisis, Muslim Albanians became torn between loyalties to the Ottoman state and the emerging Albanian nationalist movement.. Islam, the Sultan and the Ottoman Empire were traditionally seen as synonymous in belonging to the wider Muslim community.. The Albanian nationalist movement advocated self-determination and strived to achieve socio-political recognition of Albanians as a separate people and language within the state. Albanian nationalism was a movement that began among Albanian intellectuals without popular demand from the wider Albanian population.. Geopolitical events pushed Albanian nationalists, many Muslim, to distance themselves from the Ottomans, Islam and the then emerging pan-Islamic Ottomanism of Sultan Abdulhamid II.. During the Russo-Turkish war, the incoming Serb army expelled most of the Muslim Albanian population from the Toplica and Ni≈° regions into Kosovo triggering the emergence of the League of Prizren (1878‚Äì1881) as a response to the Eastern crisis.. \\"In consequence of the Russian-Ottoman war, a violent expulsion of nearly the entire Muslim, predominantly Albanian- speaking, population was carried out in the sanjak of Ni≈° and Toplica during the winter of 1877-1878 by the Serbian troops. This was one major factor encouraging further violence, but also contributing greatly to the formation of the League of Prizren. The league was created in an opposing reaction to the Treaty of San Stefano and the Congress of Berlin and is generally regarded as the beginning of the Albanian national movement. The League of Prizren was created by a group of Albanian intellectuals to resist partition among neighbouring Balkan states and to assert an Albanian national consciousness by uniting Albanians into a unitary linguistic and cultural nation.. The Ottoman state briefly supported the league's claims viewing Albanian nationalism as possibly preventing further territorial losses to newly independent Balkan states... The geopolitical crisis generated the beginnings of the Rilindja (Albanian National Awakening) period.. para. 5. From 1878 onward Albanian nationalists and intellectuals, some who emerged as the first modern Albanian scholars, were preoccupied with overcoming linguistic and cultural differences between Albanian subgroups (Gegs and Tosks) and religious divisions (Muslim and Christians).. At that time, these scholars lacked access to many primary sources to construct the idea that Albanians were descendants of Illyrians, while Greater Albania was not considered a priority. Compared with their Balkan counterparts, these Albanian politicians and historians were very moderate and mainly had the goal to attain socio-political recognition and autonomy for Albanians under Ottoman rule.. \\"These scholars did not have access to many primary sources to be able to construct the notion of the Illyrian origin of the Albanians yet, and Greater Albania was not a priority. The goal of the day was to persuade the Ottoman officials that Albanians were a nation and they deserved some autonomy with the Empire. In fact, Albanian historians and politicians were very moderate compared to their peers in neighbouring countries.. Albanians involved in these activities were preoccupied with gathering and identifying evidence, at times inventing facts to justify claims to \\"prove\\" the cultural distinctiveness and historical legitimacy of the Albanians in being considered as a nation.. Taking their lead from the Italian national movement, the Arb√´resh, (an Albanian diaspora community settled throughout southern Italy from the medieval period) began to promote and spread national ideas by introducing them to Balkan Albanians.. Prominent among them were Girolamo de Rada, Giuseppe Schir√≤ and Demetrio Camarda of whom were influenced through literature on Albania by Western scholars and referred within their literary works to Skanderbeg and a pre- Ottoman past, with reference to Pyrrhus of Epirus and Alexander the Great.... \\"Writers like Angelo Masci (1758‚Äì 1821), Emanuele Bidera (1784‚Äì 1858), De Rada‚Äôs mentor and teacher, Demetrio Camarda (1821‚Äì82), Giuseppe Crispi (1781‚Äì1859) and Vincenzo Dorsa (1823‚Äì85) were thus among the first to entertain the prospect of an autonomous Albanian nationality, collecting local folklore, turning their ancient Albanian dialect into a written language at a time when Albanian still lacked a written form, and building a national pantheon, which included Philip and Alexander the Great of Macedonia, King Pyrrhus of Epirus (fourth century BC) and Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg (1405‚Äì68). They did so under the influence of works by Western scholars on Albania, and, more importantly, in the context of the cultural revival associated with the rise of southern Italian patriotism. Calabria and Sicily, where the main Albanian diaspora was settled, were the theatre of major social and political changes in the first decades of the nineteenth century.\\" While Muslim (especially Bektashi) Albanians were heavily involved with the Albanian National Awakening producing many figures like Faik Konitza, Ismail Qemali, Midhat Frash√´ri, Shahin Kolonja and others advocating for Albanian interests and self-determination.... para. 19, 26... The Bektashi Sufi order of the late Ottoman period in Southern Albania also played a role during the Albanian National Awakening by cultivating and stimulating Albanian language and culture and was important in the construction of national Albanian ideology...... Among Catholic Albanian figures involved were Prenk Do√ßi, Gjergj Fishta and Pashko Vasa who penned the famous poem Oh Albania which called for Albanians overcoming religious divisions through a united Albanianism.. The last stanza of Vasa's poem Feja e shqyptarit asht shqyptarija (The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism) became during the national awakening period and thereafter a catchword for Albanian nationalists.. \\"Feja e shqyptarit asht shqyptarija (The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism) which was to become a catchword of Albanian nationalists both in the Rilindja period and later. = Skanderbeg = Skanderbeg Monument in Tirana. Another factor overlaying geopolitical concerns during the National Awakening period were thoughts that Western powers would only favour Christian Balkan states and peoples in the anti Ottoman struggle. During this time Albanian nationalists attempting to gain Great Power sympathies and support conceived of Albanians as a European people who under Skanderbeg resisted Ottoman Turks that later subjugated and cut the Albanians off from Western European civilisation.. As such, the Skanderbeg myth presented Albanians as defending Europe from the \\"Asian hordes\\" and allowed Albanians to develop the myth of Albanian resistance to foreign enemies that threatened the \\"fatherland\\" and the unity of the Albanian nation. Albanian nationalists needed an episode from medieval history to centre Albanian nationalist mythology upon and chose Skanderbeg in the absence of a medieval kingdom or empire.. \\"..an episode taken from medieval history was central for Albanian national mythology. In the absence of medieval kingdom or empire the Albanian nationalists choose Skanderbeg...\\" From the 15th to the 19th century Skanderbeg's fame survived mainly in Christian Europe and was based on a perception of Skanderbeg's Albania serving as Antemurale Christianitatis (a barrier state) against \\"invading Turks\\".. In Albania, largely Islamicized during this period, Skanderbeg's fame faded and was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century when that figure was brought to the level of national myth.. Another measure for nationalists promoting the Skanderbeg myth among Albanians was for them to turn their backs on their Ottoman heritage which was viewed as being the source of the Albanians' predicament.. Skanderbeg's Christian identity was avoided and he was presented mainly as a defender of the nation... Albanian nationalist writers transformed Skanderbeg's figure and deeds into a mixture of historical facts, truths, half-truths, inventions, and folklore.. \\"The nationalist writers... transform history into myth ... As with most myths his figure and deeds became a mixture of historical facts, truths, half-truths, inventions and folklore.\\" = Western influences and origin theories = In the 19th century Western academia imparted its influence on the emerging Albanian identity construction process by providing tools that were utilised and transformed in certain contexts and toward goals within a changing environment. This differed from the context from which Western authors had originally generated their theories. Albanian nationalists of the period were educated in foreign schools abroad.. Some 19th century Western academics examining the issue of Albanian origins promoted the now-discredited theory of Albanian descent from ancient Pelasgians.. Developed by the Austrian linguist Johann Georg von Hahn in his work Albanesiche Studien (1854) the theory claimed the Pelasgians as the original proto-Albanians and the language spoken by the Pelasgians, Illyrians, Epirotes and ancient Macedonians being closely related. This theory quickly attracted support in Albanian circles, as it established a claim of precedence over other Balkan nations, the Slavs and particularly the Greeks... In addition to generating a \\"historic right\\" to territory, this theory also established that ancient Greek civilization and its achievements had an \\"Albanian\\" origin. The Pelasgian theory was adopted among early Albanian publicists and used by Italo-Albanians, Orthodox and Muslim Albanians.. Italo-Albanians being of the Greek rite and their culture having strong ecclesiastical Byzantine influence were not in favour of the Illyrian-Albanian continuity hypothesis as it had overtones of being Catholic and hence Italianate.. \\"We saw that Italo-Albanian scholars in general do not favour the Illyrian-Albanian continuity thesis. Why? Because Italo-Albanian culture has a strong Byzantine imprint. All the aforementioned scholars were followers of the Greek rite... For to them 'Illyrian' has strong overtones of 'Catholic,' and 'Catholic' in turn connotes 'Italianate'.\\" For Italo- Albanians, the origins of the Albanians lay with the Pelasgians, an obscure ancient people that lived during antiquity in parts of Greece and Albania. To validate Albanian claims for cultural and political emancipation, Italo- Albanians maintained that the Albanian language was the oldest in the region than even Greek.. \\"De Rada‚Äôs contribution to the formulation of a theory about the historical origins of the Albanian nation reflected both his concern to emphasize the close association between Italy and Albanian nationalism, and his preoccupation with the distinctiveness of the Albanian nationality as against the Greek. The Italo-Albanians identified the origins of the Albanian nation in the Pelasgian or Pellazg people (otherwise known as Pelasgi in Risorgimento literature), whose history could be traced back to 2000 BC, and whose territories covered parts of Greece, Albania itself, and, further to the west, Italy and Sicily; they stressed the sheer antiquity of the Albanian language, deeming it to be the oldest in the region, even older than Greek, in order to justify their claims to political and cultural emancipation.\\" The theory of Pelasgian origins was used by the Greeks to attract and incorporate Albanians into the Greek national project through references to common Pelasgian descent.; p. 114. \\"The Greek propagandists, on the other hand used it in order to attract Albanians to their side.\\" The Pelasgian theory was welcomed by some Albanian intellectuals who had received Greek schooling.. \\"These theories were of particular importance in southern Albania, whose territory was disputed between Albanian and Greek nationalisms.... On the Greek side, the Pelasgic theory was at first used to facilitate the incorporation of all Albanians (and other inhabitants of the Balkans) into the Greek national projects as common descendants of the Pelasgians; this theory was at first welcome by some Greek educated Albanian intellectuals (Sigalas 1999: 62-85). On the Albanian side, it supported the claim of priority and ownership of Albanians on the territories they inhabited\\" For Orthodox Albanians such as Anastas Byku a common ancestry of both Albanians and Greeks through Pelasgian ancestors made both peoples the same and viewed the Albanian language as a conduit for Hellenisation.. para. 9, 12-15, 25. For Muslim Albanians like Sami Frash√´ri Albanians stemmed from the Pelasgians, an older population than Illyrians thereby predating the Greeks making for him the Albanians descendants of Illyrians who themselves originated from Pelasgians... Figures originating from the ancient period such as Alexander the Great and Pyrrhus of Epirus were enveloped in myth and claimed as Albanian men of antiquity while Phillip II of Macedon, the ancient Macedonians were Pelasgian or Illyrian-Albanian... \\"The greatest expansion of Hellenic civilization and rule thus occurred thanks to an 'Albanian' and not a Hellene\\". Albanian writers of the period felt that they had counter arguments that came from the Greek side and from Slavic circles. The Greeks claimed that Albanians did not constitute a people, their language was a mixture of different languages and that an Albanian member of the Orthodox church was \\"really a Greek\\", while Slav publicists claimed that Kosovar Albanians were \\"really\\" Slavs or they were \\"Turks\\" who could be \\"sent back\\" to Anatolia.. \\"The myth of ethnic homogeneity and cultural purity, however, dictated otherwise... That Albanian writers felt the need to argue in this way was easily understandable at a time when Greek propagandists were claiming that the Albanians were not a proper people at all, that their language was just a mish mash of other languages and that any member of the Greek Orthodox Church was 'really' a Greek. At the same time, Slav publicists were insisting either that the Albanians of Kosova were 'really' Slavs, or that they were 'Turks' who could be 'sent back' to Turkey.\\". Apart from Greek nationalism being viewed as a threat to Albanian nationalism, emphasising an antiquity of the Albanian nation served new political contexts and functions during the 1880s. It also arose from the Albanian need to counter Slavic national movements seeking independence from the Ottomans through a Balkan federation.. \\"In the political context of the 1880s, however, emphasis on the antiquity of the Albanian nation served new political purposes, since Greek nationalism was no longer the sole threat to Albanian nationalism. In fact, it was designed to counter also the Slavic national movements, several of which in the 1880s were planning to create a Balkan federation as a means to liberate themselves from the dominion of the Sublime Porte.\\" In time the Pelasgian theory was replaced with the Illyrian theory regarding Albanian origins and descent due it being more convincing and supported by some scholars. The Illyrian theory became an important pillar of Albanian nationalism due to its consideration as evidence of Albanian continuity in territories such as Kosovo and the south of Albania contested with the Serbs and Greeks.. \\"But gradually, while the Albanian national movement matured, the romantic Pelasgian theory and others were replaced by the theory of Illyrian descent, which was more convincing because it was supported by a number of scholars. The Illyrian descent theory soon became one of the principal pillars of Albanian nationalism because of its importance as evidence of Albanian historical continuity in Kosovo, as well as in the south of Albania, i.e in the areas contested by Serbs or Greeks.\\" = Geopolitical consequences and legacy = Unlike their Greek, Serbian and Bulgarian neighbours who had territorial ambitions, Albanians due to being mainly Muslim lacked a powerful European patron. This made many of them want to preserve the status quo and back Ottomanism. By the early 20th century, Albanian nationalism was advanced by a wide-ranging group of Albanian politicians, intellectuals and exiles.. An Albanian emigrant community was present in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the majority being illiterate and individuals like Sotir Peci worked to impart a sense of Albanian nationhood among them encouraging the spread of literacy in Albanian.. In 1908, an alphabet congress in Bitola with Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox delegates in attendance agreed to adopt a Latin character-based Albanian alphabet and the move was considered an important step for Albanian unification. Opposition toward the Latin alphabet came from some Albanian Muslims and clerics who with the Ottoman government preferred an Arabic-based Albanian alphabet, due to concerns that a Latin alphabet undermined ties with the Muslim world... Due to the alphabet matter and other Young Turk policies, relations between Albanian elites and nationalists, many Muslim and Ottoman authorities broke down... Though at first Albanian nationalist clubs were not curtailed, the demands for political, cultural and linguistic rights eventually made the Ottomans adopt measures to repress Albanian nationalism which resulted in two Albanian revolts (1910 and 1912) toward the end of Ottoman rule... Manastir (1908) Albanian nationalism during the late Ottoman era was not imbued with separatism that aimed to create an Albanian nation-state, though Albanian nationalists did envisage an independent Greater Albania. Albanian nationalists of the late Ottoman period were divided into three groups. Pan-Albanian nationalists, those who wanted to safeguard Albanian autonomy under an Ottoman state and an Albania divided along sectarian lines with an independent Catholic Albania envisaged mainly by Catholics.. The emerging Albanian nationalist elite promoted the use of the Albanian language as a medium of political and intellectual expression.. Albanian nationalism overall was a reaction to the gradual breakup of the Ottoman Empire and a response to Balkan and Christian national movements that posed a threat to an Albanian population that was mainly Muslim.. Efforts were devoted to including vilayets with an Albanian population into a larger unitary Albanian autonomous province within the Ottoman state. Albanian nationalists were mainly focused on defending rights that were sociocultural, historic and linguistic within existing countries without being connected to a particular polity..\\"Nineteenth-century Albanianism was not by any means a separatist project based on the desire to break with the Ottoman Empire and to create a nationstate. In its essence Albanian nationalism was a reaction to the gradual disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and a response to the threats posed by Christian and Balkan national movements to a population that was predominantly Muslim. In this sense, its main goal was to gather all ‚ÄòAlbanian‚Äô vilayet's into an autonomous province inside the Ottoman Empire. In fact, given its focus on the defence of the language, history and culture of a population spread across various regions and states, from Italy to the Balkans, it was not associated with any specific type of polity, but rather with the protection of its rights within the existing states. This was due to the fact that, culturally, early Albanian nationalists belonged to a world in which they were at home, though poised between different languages, cultures, and at times even states.\\". Unlike other Balkan nationalisms religion was seen as an obstacle and Albanian nationalism competed with it and developed an anti clerical outlook. As Albanians lived in an Ottoman millet system that stressed religious identities over other forms of identification, the myth of religious indifference was formed during the National Awakening as a means to overcome internal religious divisions among Albanians... Promoted as civil religion of sorts, Albanianism as an idea was developed by Albanian nationalists to downplay established religions such as Christianity and Islam among Albanians while a non-religious Albanian identity was stressed... Religion did not play a significant role as in other Balkan nationalisms or to mainly become a divisive factor in the formation of Albanian nationalism which resembled Western European nationalisms.. The Albanian language instead of religion became the primary focus of promoting national unity... Albanian National Awakening figures during the late Ottoman period generated vernacular literature in Albanian. Often those works were poems which contained nationalist aspirations and political themes which in part secured support for the Albanian nationalist cause when transformed into narrative songs that spread among the male population of Albanian speaking villagers in the Balkans.. Nation building efforts gained momentum after 1900 among the Catholic population by the clergy and members such as craftsmen and traders of the Bektashi and Orthodox community in the south. With a de-emphasis of Islam, the Albanian nationalist movement gained the strong support of two Adriatic sea powers Austria-Hungary and Italy who were concerned about pan-Slavism in the wider Balkans and Anglo-French hegemony purportedly represented through Greece in the area.. \\"Œ†ŒµœÅŒπŒøœÅŒØŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ œÑŒπœÇ Œ±œÅœáŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒπœÉŒªŒ±ŒºŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒµŒæŒ¨œÅœÉŒµŒπœÇ, œÑŒø Œ±ŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå Œ∫ŒØŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ± ŒµŒæŒ±œÉœÜŒ¨ŒªŒπœÉŒµ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ œÄœÅŒøœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒØŒ± œÑœâŒΩ Œ¥œçŒø ŒπœÉœáœÖœÅœéŒΩ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ¨ŒºŒµœâŒΩ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒ¥œÅŒπŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ, œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒôœÑŒ±ŒªŒØŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëœÖœÉœÑœÅŒØŒ±œÇ, œÄŒøœÖ Œ¥ŒÆŒªœâŒΩŒ±ŒΩ Œ≠œÑŒøŒπŒºŒµœÇ ŒΩŒ± Œ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ œå,œÑŒπ ŒºœÄŒøœÅŒøœçœÉŒ±ŒΩ Œ≥ŒπŒ± ŒΩŒ± œÉœéœÉŒøœÖŒΩ œÑŒ± ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒπŒ± Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±œÄŒµŒπŒªŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±ŒΩœÉŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒπœÉŒºŒøœç Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒªŒøŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ∫Œ∑Œ¥ŒµŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒ± œÄŒøœÖ œÖœÄŒøœÑŒØŒ∏ŒµœÑŒ±Œπ œåœÑŒπ Œ∏Œ± Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÄœÅŒøœÉœéœÄŒµœÖŒµ Œ∑ ŒµœÄŒ≠Œ∫œÑŒ±œÉŒ∑ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±œÇ.

The dissemination of ideas in Albanian Christian population started to become visible and very concerning to Greece].\\". Independence and interwar period Ismail Qemali on the first anniversary of the session of the Assembly of Vlor√´ which proclaimed the Independence of Albania. The imminence of collapsing Ottoman rule through military defeat during the Balkan wars pushed Albanians represented by Ismail Qemali to declare independence (28 November 1912) in Vlor√´ from the Ottoman Empire. The main motivation for independence was to prevent Balkan Albanian inhabited lands from being annexed by Greece and Serbia.. On the eve of independence the bulk of Albanians still adhered to pre-nationalist categories like religious affiliation, family or region. Both highlanders and peasants were unprepared for a modern nation state and it was used as an argument against Albanian statehood. With the alternative being partition of Balkan Albanian inhabited lands by neighbouring countries, overcoming a fragile national consciousness and multiple internal divisions was paramount for nationalists like state leader Ismail Qemali. Developing a strong Albanian national consciousness and sentiment overrode other concerns such as annexing areas with an Albanian population like Kosovo.. Kosovar Albanian nationalism has been defined through its clash with Serbian nationalism where both view Kosovo as the birthplace of their cultural and national identities.. Ottoman rule ended in 1912 during the Balkan Wars with Kosovo and North Macedonia becoming part of Serbia. During this time Serb forces in Kosovo engaged in killings and forced migration of Albanians while the national building aims of the Serbian state were to assimilate some and remove most Albanians by replacing them with Serbian settlers. The Serb state believed that Albanians had no sense of nationhood while Albanian nationalism was viewed as the result of Austro-Hungarian and Italian intrigue.. These events fostered feelings of Albanian victimisation and defeatism, grudges against the Serbs and Great Powers who had agreed to that state of affairs which ran alongside Albanian nationalism. Kosovar Albanian nationalism drew upon and became embedded in popular culture such as village customs within a corpus of rich historical myths, distinctive folk music referring to harvests along with marriage and clan based law.. Azem Galica and Shota Galica, leaders of the Ka√ßak movement (1920) Albania during World War One was occupied by foreign powers and they pursued policies which strengthened expressions of Albanian nationalism especially in Southern Albania. Italian and French authorities closed down Greek schools, expelled Greek clergy and pro-Greek notables while allowing Albanian education with the French sector promoting Albanian self-government through the Kor√ß√´ republic.. Another factor that reinforced nationalistic sentiments among the population was the return of 20-30,000 Orthodox Albanian emigrants mainly to the Kor√ß√´ region who had attained Albanian nationalist sentiments abroad.. The experience of World War One, concerns over being partitioned and loss of power made the Muslim Albanian population support Albanian nationalism and the territorial integrity of Albania.. An understanding also emerged between most Sunni and Bektashi Albanians that religious differences needed to be sidelined for national cohesiveness.. \\"Most Muslims and Bektashis understood that religious differences had to be played down in the name of common ethnicity and that pan-Islamic ideas had to be rejected and fought, even if some so-called 'fanatical' (Sunni) Muslim leaders in Shkod√´r and elsewhere preferred solidarity with the rest of the Islamic world. Such an attitude was not conducive to Albanian independence to which the international situation was favourable in 1912 and even after World War I.\\" During the First World War occupation by Austro-Hungarian forces Albanian schools were opened in Kosovo that later were shut down during the interwar years by Yugoslav authorities while religious Islamic education was only permissible in Turkish. Secular education in the Albanian language within Kosovo, Macedonia and other areas in Yugoslavia with an Albanian population was banned and replaced with a Serbian school curriculum... Yugoslav education policy repressed Albanian secular education to undermine sentiments of Albanian national identity and culture with a view to preventing possible nationalist challenges to Yugoslavia.. Albanian schooling moved into tekkes, maktabs and madrasas that emerged as underground centres for spreading and generating Albanian nationalism.. \\"The Muslim clergy heralded the superiority of national rather than religious identity by furthering education in Albanian, but, their engagement in this process implied the strengthening of the religious element in Albanian nationhood. This contrasted with the efforts of the nationalists, who tried to construct an Albanian national identity on a purely secular foundation. Religious Muslim schools by the 1930s became viewed as a threat to the state and Yugoslav authorities replaced Albanian Muslim clergy with pro-Serbian Slavic Muslim clergy and teachers from Bosnia to prevent Albanian nationalist activities developing in religious institutions... Albanians opposed those moves and boycotted imposed teachers.. The Albanian language was prohibited by Yugoslav authorities and some Albanians were made to emigrate.. \\"The use of the Albanian language was prohibited and Albanians were forced to emigrate.\\" During the 1920s the role of religion was downplayed by the Albanian state who instead promoted Albanianism, a broad civic form of nationalism that looked to highlight ethnonational identity over religious identities.. In areas such as the Kor√ß√´ region where Orthodox Albanians became affected by Albanian nationalism they moved away from Orthodox church influence and tended to lose their religious identity, while in areas were the Orthodox population was the majority they often retained their religious identity.. The ascension of Ahmet Zog as prime minister (1925) and later king (1929) during the interwar period was marked by limited though necessary political stability. Along with resistance by Zog to interwar Italian political and economic influence in Albania those factors contributed to an environment were an Albanian national consciousness could grow.. Under Zog regional affiliations and tribal loyalties were gradually replaced with a developing form of modern nationalism.. \\"This degree of political stability, limited though it was, did much to create an environment necessary for the growth of an Albanian national consciousness. Zog significantly contributed to the process of replacing tribal loyalty and local and regional pride with a rudimentary form of modern state nationalism.\\" During that time Zog attempted to instill a national consciousness through the scope of a teleological past based upon Illyrian descent, Skanderbeg's resistance to the Ottomans and the nationalist reawakening (Rilindja) of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The myth of Skanderbeg under Zog was used for nation building purposes and his helmet was adopted in national symbols. Generating mass nationalism was difficult during the interwar period as even in 1939, 80% of Albanians were still illiterate.. Apart from using the title King of the Albanians Zog did not pursue irredentist policies such as toward Kosovo due to rivalries with Kosovar Albanian elites and an agreement recognizing Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo in return for support.. Zog's efforts toward the development of Albanian nationalism made the task simpler for leaders that came after him regarding the process of Albanian state and nation building.. Kosovo Albanian rebels controlling a road in Kosovo, (1920s) Secessionist sentiments after the First World War became expressed through the Ka√ßak movement led by the Kosovo Committee made up of Kosovar Albanian exiles opposed to Yugoslav rule. Represented on the ground as a guerilla group in Kosovo and North Macedonia, the Ka√ßak movement was led by Azem Galica and later his wife Shota Galica that fought a small-scale war (1918-1921) in formations of √ßetas or fighting bands against the Yugoslav army... Supported by Italy who gave financial aid and Albania, the Ka√ßak movement was eventually suppressed by the Serbs during the late 1920s.. The movement contributed to the development of an Albanian national consciousness in Kosovo and North Macedonia.. \\"The ka√ßak movement was suppressed by the Serbs in the second half of the 1920s, but it nevertheless contributed to the development of a national consciousness among the Albanians.\\" Yugoslav authorities in the 1930s replaced Albanian imams with ones that were hostile to Sufism from Bosnia weakening Albanian nationalism.. Kosovar Albanians were viewed by Yugoslav authorities as an enemy within that could challenge the territorial integrity of the state.. Albanians in Kosovo felt that Serbian and later Yugoslav rule constituted a foreign conquest. Confiscations of Albanian land and settlement of Serbian colonists throughout the interwar period drove Kosovar Albanians during the Second World War to collaborate with the Axis powers who promised a Greater Albania.  World War II  The Italian Protectorate of Albania established by Italy in August 1941. On 7 April 1939, Italy headed by Benito Mussolini after prolonged interest and overarching sphere of influence during the interwar period invaded Albania.. Italian fascist regime members such as Count Galeazzo Ciano pursued Albanian irredentism with the view that it would earn Italians support among Albanians while also coinciding with Italian war aims of Balkan conquest.. The Italian annexation of Kosovo to Albania was considered a popular action by Albanians of both areas and initially Kosovar Albanians supported Axis Italian forces.. Western North Macedonia was also annexed by Axis Italy to their protectorate of Albania creating a Greater Albania under Italian control.. Members from the landowning elite, liberal nationalists opposed to communism with other sectors of society came to form the Balli Komb√´tar organisation and the collaborationist government under the Italians which all as nationalists sought to preserve Greater Albania.. While Italians expressed increased concerns about conceding authority to them.. In time the Italian occupation became disliked by sections of the Albanian population such as the intelligentsia, students, other professional classes and town dwellers that generated further an emerging Albanian nationalism fostered during the Zog years.. Xhem Hasa (centre) with his brothers, Musli Hasa (left) and Abdullah Hasa (right) Collapse of Yugoslav rule resulted in actions of revenge being undertaken by Albanians, some joining the local Vulnetari militia that burned Serbian settlements and killed Serbs while interwar Serbian and Montenegrin colonists were expelled into Serbia proper.. The aim of these actions were to create a homogeneous Greater Albanian state.. Italian authorities in Kosovo and Western North Macedonia allowed the use of the Albanian language in schools, university education and administration.. In Kosovo, western North Macedonia and other newly attached territories to Albania, non-Albanians had to attend Albanian schools that taught a curricula containing nationalism alongside fascism and were made to adopt Albanian forms for their names and surnames.. The same nationalist sentiments among Albanians which welcomed the addition of Kosovo and its Albanians within an enlarged state also worked against the Italians as foreign occupation became increasingly rejected. Apart from verbal opposition, other responses to the Italian presence eventually emerged as armed insurrection through the Albanian communist party. Italian authorities had misjudged the growth of an Albanian national consciousness during the Zog years with the assumption that Albanian nationalism was weak or could be directed by the Italians.. Regional divisions became heightened when resistance groups with differing agendas emerged in the north and south of Albania which slowed the growth of nationalism. In 1943, Italian control became replaced with German rule and the fiction of an independent Albania was maintained.. German occupational authorities instigated a policy of threatening the collaborationist government with military action, communist ascendancy or loss of autonomy and Kosovo to keep them in line. The Germans like the Italians misunderstood Albanian nationalism with; as a result, Albanian noncommunists lost credibility while the communist partisans appealed to growing Albanian nationalism.. In a post-war setting this meant that groups such as Balli Komb√´tar who had aligned with the Axis powers were unable to take power in Albania, while emerging leaders such as communist Enver Hoxha solidified his claim to that role by being a nationalist.. Some Albanians in western North Macedonia joined the Balli Komb√´tar, most notable being Xhem Hasa who alongside his forces collaborated with the Axis powers on various operations targeting communist Albanian and Macedonian partisans... In 1944 German forces created the SS Skanderbeg division to serve only in Kosovo with Kosovar Albanians as its main recruits and though mass desertions occurred, its members participated in operations against Serbian areas resulting in civilian deaths and pillage while the small Kosovan Jewish community was arrested and deported.. An attempt to get Kosovar Albanians to join the resistance, a meeting in Bujan (1943‚Äì1944), northern Albania was convened between Balli Komb√´tar members and Albanian communists that agreed to common struggle and maintenance of the newly expanded boundaries. The deal was opposed by Yugoslav partisans and later rescinded resulting in limited Kosovar Albanian recruits.. Some Balli Komb√´tar members such as Shaban Polluzha became partisans with the view that Kosovo would become part of Albania. With the end of the war, some of those Kosovar Albanians felt betrayed by the return of Yugoslav rule and for several years Albanian nationalists in Kosovo resisted both the partisans and later the new Yugoslav army.... Albanian nationalists viewed their inclusion within Yugoslavia as an occupation.. In Thesprotia, northwestern Greece communal discord between Muslims and Christians dating to the interwar period escalated into conflict during the war.. para. 27-60. Italian and later German forces made promises of territorial unification with Albania to local Muslim Albanian Chams who supported the Axis powers and some collaborated outright in operations violently targeting local Greeks and Greek identifying Orthodox Albanian speakers that in resulted in their expulsion (1944‚Äì1945) by EDES forces into Albania.. para. 55-63..  Albanian Nationalism during the People's Republic of Albania (1945‚Äì1991)  National History Museum, Tirana.. \\"In Tirana, Albania‚Äôs National History Museum, itself a product of Hoxha‚Äôs regime, reaches back to antiquity in a notable mural above the entrance, yet the central figure (a woman) is flanked by a worker and a partisan, making this ultimately a modern moment.\\" Hoxha emerged as leader of Albania at the end of the war and was left with the task of reconstructing Albania from what foundations remained from the Zog years. Hoxha viewed as his goal the construction of a viable independent Albanian nation state based around a \\"monolithic unity\\" of the Albanian people. Albanian society was still traditionally divided between four religious communities. In the Albanian census of 1945, Muslims (Sunni and Bektashi) were 72% of the population, 17.2% were Orthodox and 10% Catholic.. \\"The census of 1945 showed that the vast majority of society (72%) were Muslims, 17.2% of the population declared themselves to be Orthodox, and 10% Catholics.\\" The support base of the communist party was small and the need to sideline the Kosovo issue resulted in Hoxha resorting to extreme nationalism to remain in power and to turn Albania into a Stalinist state.. Hoxha implemented widespread education reform aimed at eradicating illiteracy and education which became used to impart the regime's communist ideology and nationalism. In Albania nationalism during communism had as its basis the ideology of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Nationalism became the basis for all of Hoxha's policies as the war created a \\"state of siege nationalism\\" imbued with the myth that Albanian military prowess defeated Axis forces which became a centrepiece of the regime within the context of education and culture... Other themes of Hoxha's nationalism included revering Skanderbeg, the League of Prizren meeting (1878), the Alphabet Congress (1908), Albanian independence (1912) and founding father Ismail Qemali, the Italian defeat during the Vlora War (1920) and Hoxha as creator of a new Albania.. Hoxha created and generated a cultural environment that was dominated by doctrinal propaganda stressing nationalism in the areas of literature, geography, history, linguistics, ethnology and folklore so people in Albania would have a sense of their past. The effects among people were that it instilled isolationism, xenophobia, slavophobia, linguistic uniformity and ethnic compactness.. = Origin theories during communism = Albanian nationalism stresses the continuity between Albanians and the ancient Illyrians. Imitating Stalinist trends in the Communist Bloc, Albania developed its own version of protochronist ideology, which stressed the national superiority and continuity of Albanians from ancient peoples such as the Illyrians.. \\"Protochronism became an enormously popular idea in Romanian culture in the 1970s and 1980s... Protochronism, of course had been seen before, in the Soviet claims of the 1940s... Romania was essentially importing a version of high Stalinism: a politics of hierarchy and discipline was wedded to an economics of industrialization and an ideology of nationalism. It was joined in this strategy by Albania\\".. \\"The official doctrine that Ceau»ôescu adopted was called Dacianism, Romania is not the only country to invoke its ancient roots when it comes to show national superiority, Albania also emphasized its Thraco-Illyrian origin.\\" Albanian archaeologists were directed by Hoxha (1960s onward) to follow a nationalist agenda that focused on Illyrians and Illyrian-Albanian continuity with studies published on those topics used as communist political propaganda that omitted mention of Pelasgians.. \\"Although Enver Hoxha himself supported the Pelasgic theory in his own writings (Cabanes 2004: 119), the directions he gave to Albanian archaeologists in the 1960s focused on the Illyrians and on the Illyrian- Albanian continuity. As a result, studies on the origin of Illyrians and Albanians published at that time do not even mention the Pelasgians.\\" Emphasising an autochthonous ethnogenesis for Albanians, Hoxha insisted on Albanian linguists and archaeologists to connect the Albanian language with the extinct Illyrian language. The emerging archeological scene funded and enforced by the communist government stressed that the ancestors of the Albanians ruled over a unified and large territory possessing a unique culture. Toward that endeavour Albanian archaeologists also claimed that ancient Greek poleis, ideas, culture were wholly Illyrian and that a majority of names belonging to the Greek deities stemmed from Illyrian words. Albanian publications and television programs (1960s onward) have taught Albanians to understand themselves as descendants of \\"Indo-European\\" Illyrian tribes inhabiting the western Balkans from the second to third millennium while claiming them as the oldest indigenous people in that area and on par with the Greeks. Physical anthropologists also tried to demonstrate that Albanians were biologically different from other Indo-European populations, a hypothesis now refuted by genetic analysis... = Nationalism and religion = The communist regime through Albanian nationalism attempted to forge a national identity that transcended and eroded religious and other differences with the aim of forming a unitary Albanian identity. The communists promoted the idea that religious feeling, even in a historic context among Albanians was minimal and that instead national sentiment was always important.. Albanian communists viewed religion as a societal threat that undermined the cohesiveness of the nation.. Within this context religions like Islam and Christianity were denounced as foreign with Muslim and Christian clergy criticised as being socially backward with the propensity to become agents of other states and undermine Albanian interests.. Nationalism was also used as a tool by Hoxha during his struggle to break Albania out of the Soviet bloc. Inspired by Pashko Vasa's late 19th century poem for the need to overcome religious differences through Albanian unity, Hoxha took and exploited the stanza \\"the faith of the Albanians is Albanianism\\" and implemented it literally as state policy..... The communist regime proclaimed that the only religion of the Albanians was Albanianism. In 1967 the communist regime declared Albania the only atheist and non-religious country in the world and banned all forms of religious practice in public... \\"Henceforth, Hoxha announced, the only religion would be \\"Albanianism.\\" Hoxha was using nationalism as a weapon in his struggle to break out of the Soviet bloc.\\". Within the space of several months the communist regime destroyed 2,169 religious buildings (mosques, churches and other monuments) while Muslim and Christian clergy were imprisoned, persecuted and in some cases killed.... = Name changes = Within the context of anti-religion policies the communist regime ordered in 1975 mandatory name changes, in particular surnames for citizens in Albania that were deemed \\"inappropriate\\" or \\"offensive from a political, ideological and moral standpoint\\". The regime insisted that parents and children attain non religious names that were derived from Albanian mythological figures, geographical features and newly coined names.. These names were often ascribed a supposedly \\"Illyrian\\" and pagan origin while given names associated with Islam or Christianity were strongly discouraged.. \\"One by-product of the regime's anti-religious policy was its concern with the question of people's Muslim and Christian names. Parents were actively discouraged from giving their children names that had any religious association or connotation. From time to time official lists were published with pagan, so called Illyrian or freshly minted names considered appropriate for the new breed of revolutionary Albanians. Non-Albanian names were replaced which went alongside the regime's brutal version of Albanian nationalism. These approaches resulted for example in the Albanianisation of toponyms in areas where some Slavic minorities resided through official decree (1966) and of Slavic youth though not outright of the Macedonian community as a whole... The communist regime also pursued a nationalistic anti-Greek policy.. Greeks in Albania were forced to Albanianise their names and choose ones that did not have ethnic or religious connotations resulting in Greek families giving children different names so as to pass for Albanians in the wider population.. Albanian nationalism in the 1980s became an important political factor within the scope of Hoxha's communist doctrines..  Within Yugoslavia (Kosovo and North Macedonia)  During the interwar period and after the Second World War, parts of Kosovar Albanian society lacking Albanian language education such as those residing in villages were mainly illiterate, and folk music was the main driver of nationalism. The 1950s and 1960s were a period marked by repression and anti Albanian policies in Kosovo under Aleksandar Rankoviƒá, a Serbian communist who later fell out and was dismissed by Tito.. During this time nationalism for Kosovar Albanians became a conduit to alleviate the conditions of the time.. In 1968 Yugoslav Serb officials warned about rising Albanian nationalism and by November unrest and demonstrations by thousands of Albanians followed calling for Kosovo to attain republic status, an independent Albanian language university and some for unification with Albania... Tito rewrote the Yugoslav constitution (1974) and attempted to address Albanian grievances by awarding the province of Kosovo autonomy and powers such as a veto in the federal decision making process similar to that of the republics... Flag of Albanian minority in SFR Yugoslavia Between 1971 and 1981, the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo coincided with a revival of Albanian culture that opened new avenues of national expression and awareness that came about when Yugoslavia conceded some cultural and political rights to Kosovar Albanians... The issue of Albanian nationalism in Yugoslavia during this time was left mainly for Kosovar Albanian communists to deal with and they withheld intelligence about activities on some underground organisations from Belgrade... Albanian nationalism in Kosovo is based on the idea of historic rights that Albanians are descendants of ancient Illyrians making them the first population entitled to Kosovo and predating the arrival of Slavs, the ancestors of the Serbs. Scholarship by (patriotic) Kosovar Albanian historians (1970s-onward) revolved around researching and attempting to demonstrate Illyrian-Albanian continuity alongside the precedence of that population in Kosovo and North Macedonia over Serbs and Macedonians.. Kosovar Albanian historians also focused on the Second World War partisan struggle and the Albanian contribution to the liberation of Yugoslavia as being proportionate to other nationalities. These arguments were used to justify Albanian claims toward a right to Kosovo and for the Albanian desire to elevate Kosovo as a seventh republic of the Yugoslav federation. Education in the Albanian language became a source of Albanian nationalism and was confined to Albanian language texts being inaccessible to non-Albanians while school text books were to some extent nationalistic.... Albanian historiography in Albanian language texts were viewed by critics in Yugoslavia as a root cause of the \\"indoctrination of the youth\\" in nationalism.. In 1981 there was an outburst of Albanian nationalism.. Prishtina university became a centre for some nationalistically orientated students that generated Kosovar Albanian protests (1981) over social grievances that marked the first large- scale expression of nationalism in Yugoslavia since the Croatian Spring (1971).... Kosovar Albanian communists condemned the protests and supported Yugoslav unity while leading the campaign against Albanian nationalism and in that sense shared the view of other Yugoslav communists.. The unification of Albanians in the Balkans into one state was also a feature of Kosovar Albanian nationalism and these views were confined to dissident and underground groups.. Within the context of the 1981 protests these groups, many with left- wing political orientations united to form the People's Movement of Kosovo (LPRK) in Germany (1982).. Unification of Albanians into one state was a demand viewed as separatism and irredentism in Yugoslavia which was banned.. Kosovar Albanian nationalists were divided into groups with one that wanted to focus on the Albanian question as a whole and the other mainly focusing on Kosovo.. Political dissent by Kosovar Albanians followed resulting in imprisonment and comprising the majority of political prisoners during the 1970s and 1980s.. The high birthrate in Kosovo was viewed by Albanians as a way of achieving a pure Kosovo by outnumbering local Serbs while communist politicians held the view that Albanian irredentists were attempting to rid Kosovo of Serbs.. In the 1970s and 1980s, sentiments of Albanian nationalism had spread from Kosovo to North Macedonia worrying Macedonian communist authorities which resulted in measures of state sociopolitical control over Albanian cultural and linguistic affairs suppressing expressions of Albanian nationalism in a campaign referred to as differentiation..... = Dissidence and rise of nationalism = Repression of Albanian nationalism and Albanian nationalists by authorities in Belgrade strengthened the independence movement and focused international attention toward the plight of Kosovar Albanians. The recentralisation of Yugoslavia was promoted due to events in Kosovo, while Serbian nationalism within cultural institutions and the media gained strength.. Expressions of Albanian national identity were perceived as overwhelmingly anti-Yugoslav and increasingly anti-Serb. Within that context Albanian language education was viewed as threatening Serbian borders and sovereignty and was identified with Albanian nationalism.. By 1989 the degree of autonomy that Kosovo had attained within Yugoslavia was rescinded by Serbian leader Slobodan Miloseviƒá.... Albanian nationalists created a non- governmental organisation called the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) that also gained many dissatisfied Kosovar Albanian communists who joined its ranks after autonomy was rescinded.. It was led by the intellectual Ibrahim Rugova who began a period of pacifist resistance and the league created a parallel form of government and civil society while maintaining as its goal to achieve an independent Kosovo... The Kosovo education system became the place where Serbian and Albanian nationalisms played out their conflict. Serbs asserted control of the education system, while educational opportunities for Albanians became limited as they were excluded from university and schools. This prompted Kosovar Albanians to establish a parallel education system where private homes served as schools.. Albanian students became immersed in nationalist culture by learning an Albanian history of Kosovo and were no longer exposed to Yugoslav \\"Brotherhood and Unity\\" era principles and to learning the Serbian language.. = Late 1980s and early 1990s = Logo of the KLA Kosovar Albanian national identity making unique claims to Kosovo became homogenised during the 1990s and included multiple factors that led to those developments. Of those were Albanian civil disobedience and popular resistance, the creation of a parallel society in opposition to the Serb state and some underground cells initiating conflict which in all was a reaction to Serbian government policies and repression.. From the late 1980s onward Islam within the scope of Albanian identity was downplayed by many Kosovar Albanian intellectual and political figures while Christianity was promoted as a Western marker of \\"European identity\\". Post-communism, Kosovo Albanians alongside Albanians in Macedonia became the main force steering Albanian nationalism, while Islam did not become a main focal point in articulating Albanian political nationalism. Islam was not a significant factor in the recent political mobilization of Kosovar Albanian Muslims who joined with Catholic Albanians during their struggle against the Serbs. During these years Rugova as elected president by Albanians promoted an Albanian identity that stressed their Europeanness and antiquity, in particular one based on ancient Dardania.. With the Kosovo issue sidelined at the Dayton Peace Accords (1995) ending the dissolution of Yugoslavia, more militant and younger voices disillusioned with Rugova's pacifism dominated like the Kosovo Liberation Army (founded 1992) that began attacks against Serbian forces... The KLA had emerged from the LPRK as many of its members belonged to the political movement.. As its founding goal was to unite Albanian inhabited lands in the Balkans into a Greater Albania, the ideological underpinnings of the KLA were overwhelmingly that of Albanian nationalism stressing Albanian culture, ethnicity and nation... Post-independence, a referendum was held in Albanian majority western North Macedonia for autonomy and binational state federalisation of which some Albanian politicians from Tetovo and Struga declared the Republic of Ilirida (1991-1992) aiming to unite all Yugoslav Albanians into one entity.... = Kosovo conflict (1990s) and Kosovan independence (2000s) = Two Kosovo Liberation Army members (background) with US marine (foreground), 1999 Conflict escalated from 1997 onward due to the Yugoslavian army retaliating with a crackdown in the region resulting in violence and population displacements.. Myths of first settlement and Illyrian descent served to justify for Kosovar Albanians the independence struggle seen as one to eventually unite Albanian lands into a unitary state recreating the mythical state of Illyicum encompassing contemporary Balkan Albanian inhabited lands. A shootout at the Jashari family compound involving Adem Jashari, a KLA commander and surrounding Yugoslav troops in 1998 resulted in the massacre of most Jashari family members. The event became a rallying myth for KLA recruitment regarding armed resistance to Serb forces.. \\"We concentrate on one symbolic event - the massacre of the insurgent Jashari family, killed in the hamlet of Prekaz in March 1998 while fighting Serb troops. This was neither the only massacre nor the worst during the recent conflict...\\"; pp: 515-516. By 1999 international interest in Kosovo eventuated into war resulting in NATO intervention against Miloseviƒá, ethnic cleansing of thousands of Albanians driving them into neighbouring countries with the cessation of conflict marking the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces... Many people from non-Albanian communities such as the Serbs and Romani fled Kosovo fearing revenge attacks by armed people and returning refugees while others were pressured by the KLA and armed gangs to leave.. Post conflict Kosovo was placed under an international United Nations framework with the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) overseeing administrative affairs and the UN Kosovo Force (KFOR) dealing with defence..  Contemporary Albanian Nationalism in the Balkans  = Albania = Due to the legacy of Hoxha's dictatorial and violent regime, Albanians in a post communist environment have rejected Hoxha's version of Albanian nationalism. Instead it has been replaced with a weak form of civic nationalism and regionalism alongside in some instances with a certain anti-nationalism that has inhibited the construction of an Albanian civil society.. Post-communist Albanian governments view the tenets of the Albanian National Awakening as being a guiding influence for Albania by placing the nation above sociopolitical and religious differences and steering the country toward Euro-Atlantic integration.. Themes and concepts of history from the Zog and later Hoxha era have still continued to be modified and adopted within a post communist environment to fit contemporary Albania's aspirations regarding Europe.. Trends from Albanian nationalist historiography composed by scholars during and of the communist era onward linger on that interpret Ottoman rule as being the \\"yoke\\" period, akin to other Balkan historiographies. The legacy of understanding history through such dichotomies has remained for a majority of Albanians which for example they view Skanderbeg and the anti-Ottoman forces as \\"good\\" while the Ottomans are \\"bad\\". The Albanian government depicts Skanderbeg as a leader of the Albanian resistance to the Ottomans and creator of an Albanian centralised state without emphasizing his Christian background. Figures from the Muslim community such as state founder Ismail Qemali is revered by the government and viewed by Albanians as a defender of the nation though their religious background has been sidelined.. The figure of Saint Mother Teresa, an Albanian nun known for missionary activities in India has been used for nationalist purposes in Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia.. \\"The huge interest in Mother Teresa of different political, nationalist and religious figures and groups in Albania, Kosova, Macedonia and elsewhere in the Balkans has all the signs of a calculated ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô. Mother Teresa is apparently being used by some circles in the region, after her death as much as when she was alive, to further their political, nationalistic and religious causes.\\"; p.234. Within Albania she is promoted inside and outside Albania by the political elite as an Albanian symbol of the West to enhance the country's international status regarding Euro-Atlantic aspirations and integration..  Influence of origin theories in contemporary society and politics  Within the sphere of Albanian politics, the Illyrians are officially regarded as the ancestors of the Albanians.. The Illyrian theory continues to influence Albanian nationalism, scholarship and archeologists as it is seen as providing some evidence of continuity of an Albanian presence in Kosovo, western Macedonia and southern Albania, i.e., areas that were subject to ethnic conflicts between Albanians, Serbs, Macedonians and Greeks... For some Albanian nationalists claiming descent from Illyrians as the oldest inhabitants of the Western Balkans allows them to assert a \\"prior claim\\" to sizeable lands in the Balkans.. \\"they thus claim to be the oldest indigenous people of the western Balkans\\". In the context of the so-called authochtony theory, Albanian scholars reject any resemblances of Mycenaean Greek burial patterns found in Albania during the Late Bronze Age as coincidental or non-existent. Though archaeological and linguistic evidence points that Illyrians had not an homogeneous ethnic entity, even today this is challenged in local scholarship. Greek and Roman figures from antiquity such as Aristotle, Pyrrhus of Epirus, Alexander the Great and Constantine the Great are also claimed.. \\"They claimed that Alexander the Great and Aristotle were of Albanian descent.\\". \\"Pyrrhus who lived a century later has been hailed as primary Albanian hero\\". Those from the elite like Ismail Kadare, a prominent Albanian novelist has repeated in his writings themes from communist nationalistic Albanian historiography about Albanian closeness to ancient Greeks based on Homeric ideals, claiming that the Albanians are more Greek than the Greeks themselves, and initiating debates on Albanian identity claiming Albanians as being a white people and Islam as foreign.. \\"Beyond the claims of Illyrian descent and continuity a more powerful myth emerges here: that the Albanians are more Greek than the Greeks themselves because Albanians are closer to Homeric society and Homeric ideals.\\". Rejected by modern scholarship, during the late 1990s and early 2000s the Pelasgian theory has been revived through a series of translated foreign books published on Albania and other related topics and plays an important role in Albanian nationalism today.. Among them are authors Robert D'Ang√©ly, Edwin Everett Jacques, Mathieu Aref and Aristeidis Kollias, whose works have revitalised 19th century ideas about Albanian descent from ancient Pelasgians (shared with the Greeks) and being a European \\"white race\\" originating from them alongside many Greek words having an Albanian etymology. In Albania the Pelasgian theory has been used by Albanians in Albania and Albanian immigrants in Greece as a tool to rehabilitate themselves as an ancient and autochthonous population in the Balkans to \\"prove\\" the precedence of Albanians over Greeks.. The revival of the alternative Pelasgian theory has occurred within the context of post-communist Greek-Albanian relations to generate cultural hegemony and historical precedence over the Greeks and sometimes toward other (historical) European cultures by Albanians.. \\"They state that the Pelasgians were spread all over Europe and the Mediterranean: according to those authors, all ancient civilisations in Europe (Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Celtic, etc.) stemmed from the Pelasgic civilisation. They were the first Europeans; their direct descendants, the Albanians, are thus the most ancient and most authentically European people.\\". Albanian schoolbooks, mainly in relation to language, have also asserted at times that the Illyrians are the heirs of the Pelasgians.. \\"Schoolbooks however differ on what they assert on the relation between Pelasgians and Illyrians: the latter are sometimes said to be the heirs of the former, especially with regard to their language (Kuri, Zekolli & Jubani 1995: 32-33).\\". = Kosovo and North Macedonia = Official flag of the Kosovan President designed by Ibrahim Rugova. The Kosovo war (1999) generated enthusiasm for using the internet among Balkan Albanians and diaspora (Europe and North America) for information and communication between communities separated by borders and geography and cyberspace has increasingly become an ethno-political space where Albanian irredentists promote Greater Albania through content like maps on websites.. In post conflict Kosovo Rugova as first president in his drive toward emphasising aspects of statehood spent time researching and pursued an identity management project that centred on ancient Dardania and designed state symbols like the presidential flag for a future independent Kosovo..Flag of Dardania Some Kosovar Albanians have referred to Kosovo as Dardania and Rugova at times supported those moves. To define Kosovo as an Albanian area, a toponyms commission (1999) led by Kosovar Albanian academics was established to determine new or alternative names for some settlements, streets, squares and organisations with Slavic origins that underwent a process of Albanisation during this period.. Those measures have been promoted by sectors of the Kosovar Albanian academic, political, literary and media elite that caused administrative and societal confusion with multiple toponyms being used resulting in sporadic acceptance by wider Kosovar Albanian society.. Jashari family compound, now Adem Jashari memorial, Prekaz In Kosovo, Albanians view themselves as being the oldest nation in the Balkans and descendants of the ancient Illyrians with their self-determination struggle being interpreted as one of first settlers in the area fighting against the Slavic Serb \\"interlopers\\". Serbs are regarded by Albanian nationalists in generalised terms as \\"Slavs\\" and view them without historic territorial rights within an expanded Albanian state. In Kosovo, the additional Dardanian-Illyrian theory also exists that claims contemporary Kosovar Albanians as direct descendants of Dardanians, a subgroup of the Illyrian people who inhabited the area in antiquity.. \\"Ethnic Albanians not only comprise the vast majority of the population in Kosova. They have also been brought up to believe that their nation is the oldest in the Balkans, directly descended from the ancient Dardanians (Dardanae), a branch of the 'Illyrian peoples' who had allegedly inhabited most of the western Balkans (including Kosova) for many centuries before the arrival of the Slavic 'interlopers'...\\". The Dardanians are viewed by Kosovar Albanians as having been Catholics and interpreted as making Albanians historically part of Western civilisation in opposition to the Slavs who are alleged to have taken Catholic churches and converted them into Orthodox ones.. The myth has impacted the struggle for Kosovan self- determination from the Serbs in that an independent Kosovo is viewed separate from Albania and as a recovery and recreation of the ancient Dardanian kingdom. Albanian unification has however been interpreted by Kosovar Albanians in the context of reuniting ancient Dardanians into a larger Illyrian whole or modern Albanians of Kosovo into a Greater Albania. The myth has also served to justify expulsion and dispossession of the perceived enemy understood as either temporary or hostile occupiers.. A strong link exists in Kosovo for Albanians between nationalist politics and archaeology.. Kosovar Albanian archaeologists continue to attempt through archeological excavations and their interpretations to connect Kosovar Albanians with the local ancient Dardanian and Illyrian populations.. para. 5, 15-18. In 2004, prolonged negotiations over Kosovo's future status, sociopolitical problems and nationalist sentiments resulted in the Kosovo riots.. Organised and spontaneous acts of violence and damage by Kosovar Albanians was directed at properties of the Serbs, their churches and the Romani leaving some dead and many displaced.. International legal precedents based on territorial sovereignty overriding self-determination were brushed aside in the case of Kosovo when parts of the international community recognised the declaration of Kosovan independence (2008). This was put down to fears that not doing so would result in Albanian nationalism possibly making the situation difficult and worse for the international community in Kosovo had conflict eventuated.. Albanian nationalism is viewed in the Balkans as having furthered events in Kosovo which has caused concerns about the phenomenon of nationalism and generated fears among Serbs, Croats, Macedonians, Romanians and Bulgarians.. The ending of the Kosovo war resulted in the emergence of offshoot guerilla groups and political organisations from the KLA continuing various violent struggles. In the Pre≈°evo valley the Liberation Army of Pre≈°evo, Medveƒëa and Bujanovac (U√áPMB) fought Serb forces (1999-2001) attempting to unite the area with neighbouring Kosovo with conflict ending in peace talks and greater Albanian rights in Serbia... In northern parts of the Republic of Macedonia the National Liberation Army (NLA) fought against Macedonian forces (2001) with conflict ending in peace talks and the signing of the Ohrid Agreement granting greater Albanian rights in Macedonia.. Sopot Post conflict, Albanians in Macedonia have placed new statues of Albanian historical figures like Skanderbeg in Skopje and named schools after such individuals while memorials have been erected for fallen KLA and NLA fighters.. Albanian nationalists view Macedonian ethnicity as invented by the Yugoslavs to weaken Serbia, prevent other identities forming and to legitimise the existence of Republic of Macedonia in Yugoslavia.. Macedonians are referred to by (nationalist) Albanians as an ethnic collectivity with the term Shkie (Slavs) that also carries pejorative connotations.. Albanian nationalists view Macedonians as being without historic territorial rights over areas in Macedonia that would become part of a Greater Albania and lay claim to half of the territory of the republic. In the political sphere Albanian parties maintain secular and nationalistic platforms while supporting the secular framework of the state with an insistence on protecting Islam and the culture of Muslim constituents along with control and interference of Muslim institutions... Unlike Albania and Kosovo, national identity and Islam are traditionally linked and stronger among Albanians from Macedonia. The status of Albanians being a minority in Macedonia and that most are Muslims have blended national and religious identity in opposition to the Orthodox Slavic Macedonian majority. Some Muslim Albanian establishment figures in Macedonia hold that view that being a good Muslim is synonymous with being Albanian.. Prime Minister Hashim Tha√ßi (left), U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (centre) and President Fatmir Sejdiu (right) with Kosovo Declaration of Independence, 2009 In post conflict Kosovo KLA fighters have been venerated by Kosovar Albanian society with the publishing of literature such as biographies, the erection of monuments and sponsoring of commemorative events.. The exploits of Adem Jashari have been celebrated and turned into legend by former KLA members, some in government, and by Kosovar Albanian society resulting in songs, literature, monuments, memorials with streets and buildings bearing his name across Kosovo... In the context of de-emphasising Islam, Kosovar Albanians have shown interest in and referred to Albanian Christian origins and heritage, in particular the Laramans (Kosovan crypto-Catholics) assisted to present Albanians as originally European despite being Muslim.. Old Albanian traditions within the Drenica region hailing as a local the medieval Serb figure Milo≈° Obiliƒá () who killed Sultan Murad I have been utilised within Kosovo school textbooks and by some Albanian nationalists to claim the knight as an Albanian.. Establishing the participation of Albanians at the Battle of Kosovo has been a means for Kosovar Albanians to claim roots of being European and to sideline the historic conversion to Islam. Within the context of the Kosovo battle and nation building, some in government circles and wider Kosovo Albanian society have promoted a narrative of continuous Albanian resistance from medieval until contemporary times to states and peoples considered foreign occupiers.. With the declaration of independence (2008), the Kosovo government has promoted the country both internally and internationally as Newborn generating an ideology that attempts to break with the past and establish a democratic multicultural future.. Albanian nationalism in Kosovo is secular while Islam is mainly subsumed within the parameters of national and cultural identity that entails at times dominant clan and familial identities.. Within the public sphere Islam at times resurfaces to challenge the dominant nationalistic view of Albanians being superficial Muslims however the political sphere remains mainly secular...  Pan-Albanianism and Albanian politics in the Balkans  Political parties advocating and willing to fight for a Greater Albania emerged in Albania during the 2000s. They were the National Liberation Front of Albanians (KKCMTSH) and Party of National Unity (PUK) that both merged in 2002 to form the United National Albanian Front (FBKSh) which acted as the political organisation for the Albanian National Army (AKSh) militant group. Regarded internationally as terrorist both have gone underground and its members have been involved in various violent incidents in Kosovo, Serbia and Macedonia during the 2000s.... In the early 2000s, the Liberation Army of Chameria (UCC) was a reported paramilitary formation that intended to be active in northern Greek region of Epirus... Political parties active only in the political scene exist that have a nationalist outlook are the monarchist Legality Movement Party (PLL), the National Unity Party (PBKSh) alongside the Balli Komb√´tar, a party to have passed the electoral threshold and enter parliament. These political parties, some of whom advocate for a Greater Albania have been mainly insignificant and remained at the margins of the Albanian political scene.. Another nationalist party to have passed the electoral threshold is the Party for Justice, Integration and Unity (PDIU) representing the Cham Albanian community regarding property and other issues related to their Second World War exile from northern Greece... The current socialist prime minister Edi Rama in coalition with the PDIU has raised the Cham issue, while at PDIU gatherings made comments about ancient Greek deities and references to surrounding territories as being Albanian earning stern rebukes from Greece.Œ†œÅŒøŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ Œ∫ŒøœÅœéŒΩŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ°Œ¨ŒºŒ± œÉœÑŒø Œ£œÖŒΩŒ≠Œ¥œÅŒπŒø œÑœâŒΩ Œ§œÉŒ¨ŒºŒ∑Œ¥œâŒΩ.

Retrieved 12 March 2017. Within the sphere of Albanian politics anti-Greek sentiments exist and have for instance been expressed by the nationalist movement turned political party the Red and Black Alliance (AK). Anti-Greek sentiments expressed as conspiracy theories among Albanians are over perceived fears of hellenisation of Albanians through economic incentives creating a \\"time-bomb\\" by artificially raising Greek numbers alongside Greek irredentism toward Southern Albania.. \\"Many Albanians still consider Greece a religious, political and territorial threat and believe that Athens is hellenizing the Albanians by giving them economic privileges for defining themselves as ethnic Greeks... According to this view, true and false ethnic Greeks in Albania may even be a 'time bomb'... because the Greater Greece policy, according to Albanian conspiracy theories, is to legitimize an annexation of South Albania by artificially inflating the number of 'Greeks' in Albania... There are conspiracy theories in which the identification with Greek expansionist plans would classify them as potential enemies of the state.. Some Albanians are in favour of Albania being more self-assertive and having a more ethnonationalist strategy toward the \\"Greek issue\\".. \\"However as with the 'Greek issue' above, a considerable number of Albania's citizens at any rate seem to call for a more self-assertive, ethnonationalist strategy than their politicians do.\\" Official ensign of the Albanian National Army The Kosovo question has limited appeal among Albanian voters and are not interested in electing parties advocating redrawn borders creating a Greater Albania. Centenary Albanian independence celebrations in 2012 generated nationalistic commentary among the political elite of whom prime-minister Sali Berisha referred to Albanian lands as extending from Preveza (in northern Greece) to Pre≈°evo (in southern Serbia), angering Albania's neighbors.. In Kosovo, a prominent left wing nationalist movement turned political party Vet√´vendosje (Self Determination) has emerged who advocates for closer Kosovo- Albania relations and pan-Albanian self-determination in the Balkans... Another smaller nationalist party, the Balli Kombetar Kosov√´ (BKK) sees itself as an heir to the original Second World War organization that supports Kosovan independence and pan-Albanian unification.. Catholic and Orthodox Albanians hold concerns that any possible unification of Balkan areas populated by sizable amounts of Albanian Muslims to the country would lead to an increasing \\"Muslimization\\" of Albania.. The ambiguity of Islam, its place and role among Balkan (Muslim) Albanians, especially in Albania and Kosovo has limited the ability of it becoming a major component to advance the cause of Great Albania. During the Kosovo crisis (1999) Albania was divided between two positions. The first being an Albanian nationalism motivating Albania to aid and provide refuge for Kosovar Albanian refugees while being a conduit for arming Kosovar Albanians and the second that the country was unable to provide those resources, aid and asylum.. Greater Albania remains mainly in the sphere of political rhetoric and overall Balkan Albanians view EU integration as the solution to combat crime, weak governance, civil society and bringing different Albanian populations together.. In the 2000s onward polling data on Kosovo-Albania unification has waned among Kosovans with support for an independent Kosovo being overwhelming (90.2%) indicating that alongside their Albanian identity a new Kosovan identity has emerged. This factor has been strongly disliked by Albanian nationalists.. However, Albanian nationalism remains popular, with Kosovar Albanians at present supporting the \\"two states, one nation\\" platform. This ensures a sustainable Kosovo state, outside of Serbian and foreign control, and a united internal and external front between Kosovo and Albania. Recently, Kosovo's and Albania's governments have signed numerous treaties and memorandums of cooperation which synchronise their policies at home and abroad, including in the diaspora, to create a Pan- Albanian approach without the need for ground unification. The rise of Vetevendosje in Kosovo has further cemented Albanian nationalism and pride within the country, as has a lack of EU integration which has pushed Kosovars to supporting a direct Kosovo-Albania unification to combat isolation, such as with visa liberalisation. Gallup surveys between 2008 and 2013 showed 73% of Kosovo Albanians wanted a union with Albania, with independence support being at high over being a part of Serbia. In 2009, one year after Kosovo declared independence, support for Kosovo-Albania unification increased to 77%. Today, Kosovo Albanians see Kosovo as the second Albanian state and unification thus being achieved, yet Albanian loyalty remains higher than loyalty to the new Kosovar/Kosovan state (primarily symbols), as seen with support for the use of the Flag of Albania.

Invented for an industrial design class by Gauri Nanda, then a graduate student at MIT Media Lab, Clocky won the 2005 Ig Nobel Prize in Economics. After earning her undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan and her master's degree from MIT, Nanda founded a company, Nanda Home, to commercialize Clocky and other home products.  History  The original prototype, built in three days, was covered with shag carpet to appear like a pet. After the end of the design class for which she invented Clocky, Nanda did not make any further plans for the device. However, several months after a description was posted on the Media Lab website, pictures of Clocky were picked up on various technology product blogs including Gizmodo, Engadget, and BoingBoing. Within two weeks information about the device became an Internet meme and Nanda, the inventor, had been booked to demonstrate the device on Good Morning America. Nanda filed for a patent and, with support from her family, left MIT after a master's degree to found Nanda Home and develop the invention for commercial production. The newer version, though not carpeted, is still designed to appear zoomorphic. Production is outsourced to Hong Kong. In October 2012 during a video interview, Gauri mentioned that over 500,000 units had already been sold.\\"Gauri Nanda, Nanda Home: In the business of running alarm clocks\\" , Town of Technology , 18 October 2012. Retrieved on 28 November 2012. The development of Clocky and marketing of it has become a Harvard Business School case study: Clocky, the Runaway Alarm Clock.  Operation  The device functions as a regular alarm clock, except that it moves on its own power when the snooze button is pressed a second time. A microprocessor ensures that the device will move at a random speed, in a random direction, and around obstacles, using a different route each time. Large wheels on shock absorbers extend beyond the top of the clock to protect it from impact should it roll off a nightstand. By the time the alarm sounds again the device is in a place unknown to the user, who is forced to determine where it is, and possibly walk to that location to press the snooze button again. Tocky Tocky is Nanda Home's second generation moving alarm clock, first advertised in 2010 as the \\"tech-savvy cousin\\" of Clocky. Similar to Clocky, it is a digital alarm clock with changeable skin that runs away on the alarm, but it is spherical (hence, it rolls on its own body rather than on wheels), has a touch screen display with a turnable round frame around it (to set the time and alarm), and receives up to over six hours of audio made by the recording the user's own voice or sounds directly to its microphone, or uploads through USB plugged from computers.Tocky Instructions Tocky also has a demo mode which enables it to move about and play installed sounds, not in the form of setting off an alarm. Nanda Home has a similar product, Ticky which has the same features as Tocky but with a digital analog-style face.

It is a midway status between a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni (fully ordained monastics) and laypersons. An anagƒÅrika takes the Eight Precepts, and might remain in this state for life. AnagƒÅrikas usually wear white clothes or robes, depending on the tradition they follow. Some traditions have special ordination ceremonies for anagƒÅrikas, while others simply take the eight precepts with a special intention. Given the lack of full ordination for women in modern Theravada Buddhism, women who wish to renounce live as anagƒÅrikƒÅs under names such as maechi in Thailand, thilashin in Myanmar, and dasa sil mata in Sri Lanka. In Vajrayana Buddhism, many nuns are technically anagƒÅrikƒÅs or ≈õrƒÅma·πáerikƒÅs (novitiates). History In monastic settings, lay attendants for monks or nuns are needed. The monastic rules restrict monks and nuns from many tasks that might be needed, including the use of money, driving, cooking, digging and cutting plants, so lay attendants help bridge this gap. AnagƒÅrikas differ from laity by their commitment to Buddhism, to their precepts, and to monastics. There is usually a notable difference in their manner, appearance and attire. In many cases, they are full-time residents at the vihara where they ordained. AnagƒÅrikas often have the intention of becoming a monk or nun at a later point, though not always. In some monasteries a period as an anagƒÅrika, often one year, is required in order to take novice ordination. The main difference between the Eight Precepts of an anagƒÅrika and the Ten Precepts of a novitiate is the rule of not handling money. Therefore, anagƒÅrika ordinations usually take place in viharas where the vinaya (monastic rules), including the rules about not handling money, are strictly followed.

Early life  Henri Krasucki's father, Izaak, a worker and activist, emigrated from Poland with his wife, a textile worker and communist activist, in 1926. During the German occupation, his father was arrested on charges of sabotage on 20 January 1943 and interned at Drancy internment camp, before being deported on 13 February to Birkenau concentration camp where he was gassed at his arrival. During his youth, Henri Krasucki involved himself in cooperative movements, before entering the Renault factory where he began activism as a trade-unionist. Under the Vichy regime, he took part to the FTP-MOI Communist resistance movement composed of immigrants under the pseudonym M√©sange (Bluetit). His brother was killed during an attack against a formation of the Wehrmacht. On 23 March 1943, Henri was arrested by the Gestapo who also detained his mother and other resistants. Tortured in the Fresnes prison, where he was detained for six months, Henri Krasucki didn't break under interrogation and kept silent. On 23 June 1943 he was deported from Drancy to Jawischowitz, a sub-camp of Auschwitz, and then to Buchenwald. Out of 1,002 Jews, including 160 children under the age of 18, deported from Drancy in the same train as him (n¬∞55), only 86 survived.Source : Le calendrier de la pers√©cution des Juifs en France by Serge Klarsfeld On 28 April 1945, Henri Krasucki returned to France, \\"just in time to demonstrate for the 1st of May,\\" as he said humorously.  Post-war  After the Liberation, he became a leader of the French Communist Party (PCF) although his main interest remained trade-unionism. In 1949, he was secretary of the departmental union of the CGT in the Seine, then entered in 1953 the PCF's federal bureau in the Seine. In 1956, he entered the central committee of the PCF, and then in 1961, the confederal bureau of the CGT, before becoming the director of the union's mouthpiece, La Vie ouvri√®re. In 1964, he became a member of the political bureau of the PCF, and was for a time one of the candidates of the CGT's leadership in 1967. However, Georges S√©guy was ultimately preferred to him, and Krasucki succeeded to him in 1982, during the 41st Congress of the CGT. He kept his functions of secretary general of the CGT until 1992, when he was succeeded by Louis Viannet. During these ten years, the membership of the CGT decreased by half, to approximatively 700,000 members. At the beginning of his mandate, Krasucki placed himself as main interlocutor with the then Socialist power, until the resignation of the Communist ministers in 1984, when Laurent Fabius succeeded to Pierre Mauroy as Prime minister. Until the beginning of the 1980s, Krasucki defended some of the most rigid orientations of the PCF, leading him to somehow oppose himself to Georges S√©guy, who was attempting, since 1978, to preserve the CGT from the consequences of the rupture of the Left-wings' Union, which had taken place in October 1977. In 1986, Krasucki was elected as vice-president of the World Federation of Trade Unions (F√©d√©ration syndicale mondiale, FSM). Although the beginning of his leadership of the CGT witnessed a radicalization of the union, he undertook a progressive evolution towards more \\"negotiation\\" with the government at the end of his mandate and took his distances with the PCF. Thus, he condemned the Tiananmen repression in 1989. In the 1980s, the French TV comedy sketch show Cocoricocoboy would include Le B√©b√™te Show, puppets satirising leading politicians and personalities. Among them was a puppet with huge crab claws, representing Krasucki (as in \\"Krab-sucki\\"). France is renowned for its strikes in which almost all the workforce put down tools. On one occasion a protest march was held by consumers protesting against the strikes. Among their slogans was \\"Krasucki en Russie\\", a call for Krasucki to be exiled to Russia, then part of the Soviet Union. Krasucki remained a member of the PCF's political bureau until 1996. He is buried at the P√®re Lachaise cemetery, near the Communards' Wall where one-hundred and forty-seven Communards were executed in 1871. His memory was saluted both by Marie-George Buffet, the national secretary of the PCF, and by then President Jacques Chirac. Legacy A roundabout in the 20th arrondissement of Paris was given the name Place Henri Krasucki in his honor on 23 June 2005. It is located at the intersection of Rue des Couronnes, Rue de la Mare, Rue Des Envierges and Rue des Cascades near Belleville. For a long time Krasucki lived just off the roundabout at 107 Rue des Couronnes.

Purpose The Central Massachusetts Regional Library System promoted and supported resource sharing, professional development, collaboration, and innovation among all types of libraries in Central Massachusetts. Its services strengthened member libraries and staff, creating a collaborative network that is essential to a high quality and accessible continuum of library services for those who live, work, or study in the region. Public libraries typically receive less than 2% of municipal funding. Academic libraries fare better, but school libraries much worse.

In the short term, alcohol advertising should only be permitted in newspapers and other adult press. Its content should be limited to factual information about brand, provenance and product strength. * An independent body should be established to regulate alcohol promotion, including product and packaging design, in the interests of public health and community safety. * The legal limit for blood alcohol concentration for drivers should be reduced to 50 mg/100ml. * All health and social care professionals should be trained to routinely provide early identification and brief alcohol advice to their clients. * People who need support for alcohol problems should be routinely referred to specialist alcohol services for comprehensive assessment and appropriate treatment.

Career Planning to become an actor, Windust co-founded with Charles Leatherbee the University Players in 1928 on Cape Cod in Falmouth, Massachusetts. The company lasted five years and included later luminaries Joshua Logan, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Mildred Natwick, Eleanor Phelps, Barbara O'Neil, Myron McCormick, Kent Smith, and Aleta Freel.See generally, Houghton, Norris. But Not Forgotten: The Adventure of the University Players. New York, William Sloane Associates: 1951. Windust directed more often than he acted. Though he began his association with the Theatre Guild in Manhattan as an assistant stage manager in 1929, he maintained his position as a director of the University Players in the off-season when they performed on Cape Cod through mid-1932. He quit the Theatre Guild briefly during the winter season of 1931-32 to direct the University Players through its 18-week winter season in Baltimore. Windust's first major credit as a professional theatre director was the 1932 West End production of Eugene O'Neill's Strange Interlude. He directed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in The Taming of the Shrew and Amphitryon 38 (which he translated from the original French) and appeared with them in Idiot's Delight, his last work as an actor. Windust's first major Broadway hit was Life with Father, the Russel Crouse/Howard Lindsay play based on the memoirs of Clarence Day, Jr., a distant relative on Windust's mother's side. (At 3,224 performances, it held the record for the longest-running Broadway production for many years. It remains the longest running non musical show in Broadway history) In quick succession, he followed with Arsenic and Old Lace and Strip for Action, giving him three hits running on Broadway at the same time. In 1947, Windust relocated to Hollywood, where he worked as the dialogue director on Stallion Road starring Ronald Reagan. His film directing career included two 1948 Bette Davis vehicles, the melodramatic Winter Meeting and the screwball comedy June Bride. The latter part of his career was spent working in the television division of Universal, directing episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Wagon Train, Leave It to Beaver, and Bachelor Father, in addition to the Thanksgiving 1957 special The Pied Piper of Hamelin, later released as a feature film. Death On March 19, 1960, Windust was taken to the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital for an operation. There he died at the age of 54.

It is named in honour of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The QEH is located on a large forested campus originally known as Falconwood Farm in the northeast corner of the city adjoining the neighbourhoods of East Royalty and Sherwood, overlooking the Hillsborough River. The Hillsborough Hospital is a psychiatric hospital located on the same campus.

At the same time, the main entrance to the QEH off Riverside Drive was upgraded and the emergency department was expanded. The opening of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in 1982 also saw the end of abortion services in the province, which had been provided at the Prince Edward Island Hospital since the late 1960s. One of the conditions that the Roman Catholic Church placed on the provincial government of Premier James Lee for merging the Catholic-affiliated Charlottetown Hospital with the secular and publicly operated Prince Edward Island Hospital into the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital was that all abortion services in the province be discontinued.

Completed in 1764, it is one of the best-preserved examples of a colonial-era brick tavern house. From 1828 to 1965 the structure was used as a county alms house. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. and Description The William Brown House is located northeast of the Woodland Beach community in Edgewater, Maryland, at the end of Londontown Road on the south bank of South River, about four miles from Annapolis. Woodland Beach is now also known locally as Londontowne. The William Brown House is a two-story brick structure with an elevated basement, seven bays wide and three deep. The hipped roof is cut off to form a deck or terrace with a massive chimney at each end. Windows in the front (south) facade are topped by brick flat arches, while windows in the rear and ends have segmental arches. Windows are nine- over-nine sashes at the first floor and nine-over-six at the second floor. A three-bay-wide pedimented pavilion projects from the center of the main facade, containing the main entrance and approached by a flight of brick and stone steps. The house is unique in its use of all-header-bond on all four sides. The interior features a wide living hall extending from front to back, intersected at its midpoint by smaller side halls leading to doors in the ends of the house. The rear (north) portion of the hall contains a fireplace and was used as a living space, while the front portion contains the stairs. Four equal-sized rooms are located in the corners formed by the hall arrangement. There are doors in each of the four elevations. History The William Brown House was built by William Brown between 1758 and 1764. It was located on the main road connecting Williamsburg, Virginia and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The South River was crossed at that point by a ferry, which was also owned by Brown. It was part of a community of about 100 lots, of which it is the only substantial survivor. The house was an extravagance for Brown, and his debts eventually caused him to convey the house and property to the estate of James Dick, who had lent Brown the money for the house and lots. The house was acquired by the county for use as a poorhouse in 1828, a role it served until 1965. It is presently a museum, operated by the London Town Foundation.

It was founded in 1997 by Vikram Akula, who served as its executive chair until November 2011. The company's mission is to provide financial services to the poor under the premise that providing financial services to poor borrowers helps to alleviate poverty.The Microfinance Promise. Jonathan Murdoch, JSTOR In 2013, the company operated across 17 Indian states.SKS Microfinance concludes two securitisation transactions Business Standard. 1 April 2013 History In an early interview at Wharton in 2008, Akula recounted having worked with an NGO in India as a loan officer on the field in 1997. The potential for impact that these loans had given him the idea of setting up SKS as a more scaled up version for micro finance. He formed it as a charity in 1998 in Hyderabad, India as a part of his PhD studies to explore the then non existent micro finance industry in India. Though claimed to be based on the Grameen bank model, SKS granted high interest (36%) loans of Rs. 10,000 to R. 2 lakh to men and women in Andhra Pradesh belonging to poor families (as compared to Grameen bank which grants income producing loans at 20% APR). However, unlike Grameen bank, SKS used an aggressive commission based system to encourage loans, thus forming a network of loan marketers who were not direct employees of SKS, but worked on a commission basis in smaller villages of Andhra Pradesh. SKS used a network of loan sharks to pursue matters with defaulters. Meanwhile, Akula got married and his wife Malini Byanna, a lawyer by profession was appointed director of some of the organisations of SKS. By this time, SKS had four major arms - SKS Foundation, SKS Education, SKS Microfinance and SKS Technologies. The foundation was subsequently able to receive grants from Indian and foreign institutions, mainly for their education related charity. 1997 to 2005 BFIL was started as a non-profit NGO named Swaya Krishi Sangam (SKS Society) in 1997 by Vikram Akula. In 2003, Akula created SKS Mutual Benefit Trusts (MBT) to change SKS Society into a for-profit entity named as SKS Microfinance. The trusts raised INR 20 million through donations as it was the minimum capital required to form an NBFC entity. With its invested capital, the trusts held 99.5% stake in SKS Microfinance. SKS Microfinance secured a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) licence in 2005 by the Reserve Bank of India. In 2004, Sitaram Rao was appointed as the company CEO after Akula. Akula retook the position in 2005. 2005 to 2010 In 2007, SKS Microfinance raised $11.5 million through equity investments led by Sequoia Capital. In 2008, it further raised $74.5 million through equity investments led by Sandstone Capital. On 28 July 2010, SKS Microfinance debuted on the Bombay Stock Exchange with an IPO that was oversubscribed 14 times.

Ravi Kumar became the non-executive chairman.Care Ratings - SKS Microfinance Limited. 6 April 2015 The company's shares meanwhile lost 96% of their value from a high of Rs. 1491.50 in 2010. 2012 to 2018 In a 2012 cover story, The Hindu reported that a marked shift took place in the values and incentives of SKS in 2008, after largescale investment began to flow in from venture capitalists and prospectors including Boston based Sandstone capital and Sequoia capital. In September 2010, reports surfaced in the media of nearly 200 suicides by defaulters of a number of micro finance institutions, including SKS finance. This led to an enquiry by the Andhra Pradesh government. In 2014, the investors in the SKS Microfinance, Mauritius Unitus Corporation, Sequoia Capital India Growth Investments and SKS Mutual Benefit Trust as well as its founder Vikam Akula relinquished their roles as promoters. In 2016, SKS Microfinance was renamed to Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd. In 2017, the company launched a loan approval system based on Adhaar to reduce the time and cost involved in the loan approval process. In the same year, it also launched its Kirana store (general store) service which allowed its customers to do financial transactions by visiting its designated stores. Later in 2017, the company entered into discussions of a possible merger with IndusInd Bank. The merger received approvals from Reserve Bank of India, National Stock Exchange of India and Bombay Stock Exchange later in 2018. MFI Crisis in India in 2011 In 2011, the micro finance industry (MFI) in India suffered a crisis due to the growing news of suicides by borrowers, and SKS to faced the brunt. In 2012, an independent investigation commissioned by the company linked SKS employees to at least seven suicides of creditors in Andhra Pradesh. A second investigation said SKS may have been involved in two other suicide cases. In 2012, SKS Microfinance cut 1200 jobs and closed 78 branches in Andhra Pradesh. Interviews with family members of the deceased, by BBC suggested that the reason for these suicides appeared to be large sub-prime loans taken by the villagers, with the active encouragement of SKS loan agents. Products SKS Microfinance offers life assurance and a variety of financial loans ‚Äì income generation loans; mid-term loans; long- term Loans; loans for purchase of products like cook-stoves, solar lights, water purifiers, mobile phones, bicycles and sewing machines; and loans secured on gold jewellery. The company lists some of the social benefits of its financial product and service offerings as \\"providing self-employed women financial assistance to support their business with enterprises, such as raising livestock, running local retail shops called kirana stores, providing tailoring and other assorted trade and services.\\" Loans were subsequently also offered to men, and for various reasons including marriage expenses and to purchase seeds.  Operations  SKs Microfinance follows the Joint Liability Group model. The methodology involves lending to individual women, using five‚Äì member groups as the ultimate guarantor for each member. Through group lending, situations of adverse selection and moral hazard due to asymmetric information are better managed. Prabal Roy Chowdhury, \\"Group-lending with sequential financing, joint liability and social capital,\\" \\"Social collateral\\" replaces asset collateral (which is lacking in the poorer segments of society). Such a system works because India is still a highly community- centric society. The concept of honour and respect within society is deeply rooted in Indian culture and willful default invites condescending glances, humiliation and even ostracism.Eric Savage, Abhijit Ray & Abhishek Fogla, \\"Indian Microfinance: Swimming Fully Clothed!,\\" In Nov 2015, SKS Microfinance Ltd has cut interest rates by one percentage point to 19.75% on the loans it offers to low-income women borrowers, making it the sole Indian microlender to offer loans at a rate below 20%.The move came after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to double the borrower limit for microfinance loans for less than 24 months. Lower interest rates can attract more borrowers in an increasingly competitive market. Microfinance companies, which had started lending at around 28-34% in 2010, are now able to charge lower interest rates because of newer avenues to raise funds at lower cost and their ability to operate more efficiently than before.\\"SKS is the first company to charge sub-20% interest rates on the core income generating loans,\\" the company claimed in a statement on Friday. This is the fourth time SKS has reduced interest rates since October 2014.

As the follow-up to Constance (1998), it was the second hard-core pornographic film ever to have been produced by an established mainstream film production company. Pink Prison is based on the Puzzy Power Manifesto developed by Zentropa in 1997, as were Zentropa's two other sex films for women: Constance (1998), and All About Anna (2005).  Plot  Katja Kean stars as a photo journalist, Mila, who breaks into a men's penitentiary to get an interview with the mysterious warden and thus win a bet with her publisher. Encounters with various inmates and staff members, including the helpful Prison Chef (Mr. Marcus), lead her gradually closer to her goal, but all is not what it seems.  Critical reception  Pink Prison was shown at Stockholm Film Festival in 1999, and at Rotterdam Film Festival in 2000. The film maintains a dreamy atmosphere and manages to turn a number of porn film conventions upside down. It became a huge success, especially in Scandinavia, and won a Venus Award in Berlin as Best Scandinavian Film. In July 2009, women's magazine Cosmopolitan (German edition) ranked Pink Prison as #1 in its Top Five of Die Besten Frauenpornos (best women's porn), calling it the \\"Vorbild f√ºr die neue Porno- Generation\\" (role model for the new porn-generation).Cosmopolitan, Juli 2009, page 30  References   External links  Official Pink Prison site * Norwegian Media Authority none-censorship decision, involving Pink Prison 1999 films Danish films 1990s erotic films 1990s pornographic films Danish erotic films ","title":"Pink Prison"},{"id":"14348009","title":"NJ Bloodline"},{"id":"14348013","text":"Vaca, In English it is used as the abbreviation of \\"vacation\\" It also may refer to: Geography *Vaca Mountains, a mountain range in Napa County, California *Vaca D√≠ez Province, Bolivia *Vaca Mare River, a tributary of the Siriu River in Romania *Vaca MicƒÉ River, a tributary of the Siriu River in Romania *Mount Vaca, located in northern California *Key Vaca, an island in the middle Florida Keys *Vaca, the former name for Cri»ôan village, Ribi»õa Commune, Hunedoara County, Romania People *Danny Vaca (born 1990), Ecuadorian football (soccer) player *Doyle Vaca (born 1979), Bolivian football (soccer) player *Edder Vaca (born 1985), Ecuadorian football (soccer) player *Eduardo Vaca, Argentine politician *Jorge Vaca (born 1959), Mexican boxer *Joselito Vaca (born 1984), Bolivian football (soccer) player Other uses *Vaca Valley Railroad, operated at Vacaville, California in the late 19th century *Vacation See also * Lavaca (disambiguation) * Vaka (disambiguation) ","title":"Vaca"},{"id":"14348027","text":"Sir Ian Thomas Gilmore DL PRCP (born 1947) is a professor of hepatology and previous president of the Royal College of Physicians of London (PRCP).

Plot A Polish translator, Ulla (Gra≈ºyna Szapo≈Çowska), grieves for her recently deceased lawyer husband. As she copes with her loss, the family of her husband's last client, Darek Stach, contacts her in need of legal documents and advice. Ulla struggles with caring for her son, and alternately trying to remember and to forget her husband, while Darek struggles to come to terms with his imprisonment for political dissidence.

As in his later scores, Preisner's music is explicitly referenced by the characters in the film itself, in this case with the main character's son playing the theme on a piano at home. Reception No End received positive critical reviews. In his review in The A.V. Club, Noel Murray felt that the film deserved to be \\"counted among his acknowledged classics.\\" Murray gave it an A+ rating. In an interview, Kie≈õlowski later said of the film: In his review in Cinemania, Dan Jardine wrote, \\"No End is Kieslowski‚Äôs dry run for Blue, both are wrenching and lensed studies of one woman‚Äôs struggle to deal with the death of loved ones in a larger charged context.

It was the first public hospital established in the province. The facility was established in 1879 under the leadership of Bishop McIntyre of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlottetown. It was the first hospital in Charlottetown and was established in the former Bishop's Residence on the site of the present-day St. Dunstan's Basilica at the corner of Dorchester and Great George streets. A large annex was constructed in 1882 and the hospital was open to people of any religious background. New facilities The increased use of the Charlottetown Hospital saw it outgrow its original building on Great George Street. In 1902, the Diocese of Charlottetown moved the hospital to larger quarters on Haviland Street in the west end of the city. A new maternity department opened in 1918 and the Charlottetown Hospital School of Nursing was established in 1920. The Charlottetown Hospital was administered by the Order of Sisters of Charity of the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral of Montreal from its establishment in 1879‚Äì1925. The Sisters of Saint Martha of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island took over the administration of the Charlottetown Hospital and St. Vincent's Orphanage, another Diocese of Charlottetown responsibility. In 1925 the Charlottetown Hospital moved into a new brick building on Haviland Street and the original wood building was converted into a nursing home which was staffed by the Sisters of St. Martha and named \\"Sacred Heart Home\\". The Diocese of Charlottetown was involved in one final health care project in Prince Edward Island when it opened the Western Hospital in Alberton in 1944, also under the administration of the Sisters of St. Martha. The Charlottetown Diocese undertook a major fundraising campaign during the late 1940s and early 1950s to finance major interior renovations to the Charlottetown Hospital, resulting in the construction of a new wing. Government operation In 1969 the provincial government took over the operation of health care facilities from the Diocese of Charlottetown as part of the provincial development plan under premier Alex Campbell. The Prince Edward Island Hospital and the Charlottetown Hospital were identified for replacement with a single modern facility. Closure In 1982, after 102 years of service, the Charlottetown Hospital closed its doors when the Queen Elizabeth Hospital opened. The opening of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in 1982 also saw the end of abortion services in the province, which had been provided at the Prince Edward Island Hospital since the late 1960s. One of the conditions that the Roman Catholic Church placed on the provincial government of Premier James Lee for merging the Catholic- affiliated Charlottetown Hospital with the secular and publicly operated Prince Edward Island Hospital into the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital was that all abortion services in the province be discontinued. The building on Haviland Street remained standing into the mid-1990s as it was re-purposed for provincial government offices, including motor vehicle licensing and driver testing under the Department of Transportation and Public Works. The Charlottetown Hospital School of Nursing was merged with other nursing schools in the province in 1969 to form the Prince Edward Island School of Nursing. This education facility closed in 1994 when its diploma programs transferred to the bachelor program at the University of Prince Edward Island. In 1995, the provincial government funded the conversion of the waterfront building housing the Charlottetown Hospital School of Nursing into a new Holland College campus called the Tourism and Culinary Centre, which houses a variety of management programs in the tourism and hospitality sector as well as the Culinary Institute of Canada. As part of the expansion of the new Holland College facility, the former Charlottetown Hospital building was demolished to make room for a parking lot. The adjoining Sacred Heart Home had been moved into a new brick structure during the 1950s.. It was closed by the Sisters of St. Martha of Prince Edward Island and was subsequently sold to a private developer and renovated into a senior citizen apartment complex.

He was an underwater pioneer, who had been diving since the 1930s.  Biography  He was the younger son of F√©lix Tailliez, a career sailor then in station in Tahiti, told in his letters the stories of pearl divers, which fascinated Philippe (who had a brother, Jean, sailor also, and a sister, Monique). Philippe Taillez left the naval college in 1924, was affected in Toulon. He became a career naval officer. He became passionate about underwater breath-holding, hunting and photography, and became the French Navy's swimming champion. Inspired by the philosophy of the Swiss naturalist Jacques Grob, whom he met in Carqueiranne where he lived, of gardening and underwater fishing, he already took heed of the fragility of the sea: \\"the fertile coastal belt, rich in colors and in fish\\", he wrote in 1937, \\"is not broader than a river.\\". Officer on the destroyer Condorcet, Tailliez made the acquaintance of a young ensign of the vessel with whom he later discovered diving and nature: the gunner Jacques-Yves Cousteau. In 1936 he introduced Cousteau, while both were officers on the Condorcet, to the sport of spearfishing and two years later to Fr√©d√©ric Dumas, another diving companion. These three men would start the history of deep-sea diving. Passionate about cinema and owner of a camera, Cousteau dreamed of making underwater films at once, but for lack of time the dream spent several years to be carried out, and the German Hans Hass made the first underwater film in the Antilles in 1939. Tailliez acquired a passion for free-diving and underwater photography. In the summer and autumn of 1943 he aided Cousteau in testing the prototype of the aqualung, making about five hundred dives, gradually going to deeper depths. These three divers would become known as the three mousquemers (musketeers of the sea). The Second World War separated their team temporarily and Tailliez in particular would take part at the time of the campaign in Syria, with naval action against the Vichy navy. On armistice leave and thus having time, in 1942 they made without breathing apparatus the first French underwater film: Par dix-huit m√®tres de fond (= \\"18 meters deep\\"), and the next year Epaves (= \\"Wrecks\\"), this time with the Cousteau-Gagnan aqualung, and with the funds of the Marseilles company of reinflation \\"Marcellin\\". In the wartime shortages, to get movie film to make Epaves, Cousteau had to buy up hundreds of unexposed short small-gauge films intended for children's toy cameras, and splice them end-to-end into movie-length reels.The Silent World (book) In 1945, the Gaullist admiral Lemonnier, having viewed this film, entrusted to Tailliez the direction of the G.R.S. (Group of Underwater Research) (which in 1950 became the G.E.R.S. (Group of Studies and Underwater Research), and is now CEPHISMER - CEllule Plong√©e Humaine et Intervention Sous la MER). He had Cousteau and Dumas assigned there, and obtained a ship, the sloop \\"Elie Monnier\\". Admiral Lemonnier appointed him as the first commanding officer of the Elie Monnier, with which the three made innumerable missions of mine clearance, underwater exploration, physiological tests (discovering the principle of the diving tables), of underwater archaeology (in Mahdia in Tunisia) and of supporting the first bathyscaphes of Professor Jacques Piccard: the FNRS II in 1949 in Dakar. At the same time they started their underwater exploration and archaeological finds off the coast of Mahdia, Tunisia. They did physiological tests, discovering the principle of diving tables. In 1949 they helped Jacques Piccard off the coast of Dakar with his prototype of the bathyscaphe. Tailliez has described these adventures in his book Plong√©es sans c√¢ble (Diving without a cable). These adventures are told in the book of Philippe Tailliez \\"Plong√©es sans c√¢ble\\" (\\"Dives without cable\\") and in the book of James Dugan, Frederic Dumas and Jacques-Yves Cousteau \\"Le Monde du silence\\" (= \\"The Silent World\\") (former to film of the same name). In 1949, Philippe Taillez was sent to French Indo-China, where he was involved in combat diving during the anti-colonial rebellion there, leaving the direction of the G.E.R.S. to Cousteau and Jean Alinat. On his return to France, Taillez began, together with Hans Sellner, the development of the Aquarius, a new type of bathyscaphe that used liquid air to float; the previous bathyscaphe used a big bag full of petrol as a float. Through lack of financial support, they could not make it technically perfect and their prototype sank during the first test. On 20 January 1955 he was designated Commander of the Northern Rhine Flotilla and of the building base \\"the Vosges\\" at Koblenz-Bingen in Germany and took its command with the centre of the Maritime Forces of the Rhine on April 24. President Nasser's plan to nationalize the Suez Canal in 1956, involved the Franco-English reaction of November 1956, marked Commander Tailliez deeply. He was also responsible for a part of a crawling \\"channel\\" of life, the Rhine, an artery essential for the economic welfare of his residents whose traffic is equivalent to that of Suez Canal: 100 million tons! He was joined soon there by the leading seaman Elies, who had been, in the Far East, one of the most solid monitors of his section of underwater intervention. Elies arrived to form, then to direct, the underwater intervention group, which obviously, was lacking with the flotilla. The binomial Taillez - Elies carried out 222 April 1956 the first dive in the pit of the narrows of Binger Loch, the deepest place in the Rhine. Taillez told about this dive in an article of the Maritime Review special number 172 of Christmas 1960, entitled \\"Dive in the Lorelei\\". On 1 August 1956, he left this Command to join a new assignment close to the diving at the edges of the Mediterranean. At the same time he conducted several underwater archaeological explorations. In 1960 he retired from the French Navy. From then on he devoted himself to the protection of the sea from environmental pollution. In 1964 he was a founding member of the scientific committee of the Port-Cros National Park. In 1982 he became the president of the GRAN (Groupe de Recherche en Arch√©ologie Navale). He was, from 1960 to 1963, the president of the technical commission of the F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise d'√©tudes et de sports sous-marins (French association for underwater studies and sports). He was also one of the founding member of the Conf√©d√©ration Mondiale des Activit√©s Subaquatiques (World Underwater Federation). Philippe Tailliez is considered as one of the fathers of modern deep-sea diving. He inspired Cousteau to his environmental consciousness. He was given many awards in France and abroad, for his multiple contributions. From 1960 to 1963 Philippe Tailliez was president of the National Technical Commission of the FFESSM and one of the founder members of the CMAS (World Confederation of the Subaqueous Activities). He was at the same time in underwater archaeology and led many sites with the assistance of the Management of underwater archaeological research and Navy. He chaired, as of his creation (1982), the GRAN (Group of Research in Naval Archaeology). After 1960, date of his retirement from the Navy, he was devoted to marine environmental protection. Keeping away from the media contrary to Cousteau, he was nevertheless very active. Founder member of the scientific Committee of the national park of Port-Cros, created in 1964 and of the Paul Ricard Oceanographical Institute, he helped and advised with a constant generosity of many impassioned explorations, cinema and sea, of which some became famous. Considered the modern \\"father of deep-sea diving\\" and the inspirer of the environmental conscience of Cousteau, Philippe Tailliez received many distinctions, in France and abroad, for his many contributions.  Movies  In 1943 he was awarded, with Cousteau and Dumas, the first prize ex-aequo on the Congr√®s du film documentaire for the first French underwater film Par dix- huit m√®tres de fond (Eighteen meters deep), shot the year before. He was awarded, again together with Cousteau and Dumas, the CIDALC Prize at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival for their film Epaves (shipwrecks).1946 Cannes Film Festival  Bibliography  Books in French about Philippe Tailliez: * Philippe Tailliez, le p√®re de la plong√©e.

Clad daily in the frugal rural dress of the camis√≥n, saya and chinelas, Do√±a Sisang, as she was widely known, was already a 61-year-old widow when she entered the film industry. Nonetheless, she chartered her family-owned LVN Pictures into a dominant position in post-World War II Philippine cinema. In addition, de Leon was one of the most highly regarded Filipino businesswomen of the first half of the 20th century. Her grandson, Mike de Leon, emerged as a highly acclaimed film director beginning in the 1970s. His 1977 film Kung Mangarap Ka't Magising was dedicated to his late grandmother on the occasion of her birth centenary. In the 1930s was the growth of Philippine cinema, and the new production studios started by her. In the nearby Hacienda Hamady, the Sampaguita Pictures Studio set up shop, while along Justice Pedro Tiangco Tuazon Boulevard in Cubao the LVN Pictures Studio opened in 1936. The studio was named using the initials of the founding families of De Leon, Villonco and Navoa, and continued to operate up to 2005. Now what is left of this historic film studio is a commemorative fountain, dedicated to her as the LVN studio‚Äôs co-founder and chairperson. The said fountain has been transferred to the Quezon Memorial Circle‚Äôs Quezon City Experience Museum, in 2017. Commemorative fountain dedicated to Do√±a Narcisa Buencamino-De Leon located in Quezon Memorial Circle, Quezon City Early life Family home of Do√±a Sisang in San Miguel, Bulacan She was born Narcisa Buencamino in San Miguel, Bulacan at October 1877, the daughter of a poet and the granddaughter of a Chinese merchant. Her father died when she was five, and she was later forced to stop schooling after the fourth grade to work for a living. In her teens, she was working odd jobs as a cook and a seamstress, and she would eventually enter the business of making umbrellas. In 1904, she married Jos√© de Le√≥n, a local government official in San Miguel, with whom she would have five children. The family settled in San Miguel, Bulacan. Businesswoman The de Le√≥n couple ventured into the rice production business, and soon would be recognized as among the leading rice producers in Luzon. By the 1920s, the couple would own several high-valued real properties in Bulacan, Manila, and other prime locations within Luzon. They also engaged in philanthropic activities and donated a hospital to their hometown of San Miguel. De Le√≥n was widowed in 1934. She moved her family to Manila, took charge of the family business, and refocused it towards real estate. It was said that the business soared to new heights when she took full control after her husband's death. She would also become the first woman appointed to the board of directors of a government corporation when she was named by President Manuel Quezon to the board of the National Rice and Corn Corporation. In the 1950s, De Le√≥n would be among the organizing shareholders of Republic Cement Corporation, which soon became among the leading cement producers in the country. Filipino film industry. She agreed, and in 1938, her family, along with the Villongco and Navoa families, contributed capital to establish a film studio. The company was named LVN Pictures, the name taken from the respective initials of the three founding families. Apart from de Leon, the two other principal founding partners of LVN Pictures were Carmen Villongco and Eleuterio Navoa Sr. LVN broke into the Philippine film industry with the successful release of its first feature, Carlos Vander Tolosa's musical Giliw Ko, released in 1939. De Le√≥n was elected president of LVN Pictures in 1940, and she eventually bought out the shares of her other partners, gaining full control over the studio. Giliw Ko was followed with another successful film, Manuel Conde's Ibong Adarna (1941), which featured the first color sequence in a Filipino film and was the first local film to earn more than a million pesos.Garcia, J. \\"A Movie Quizbook\\", page 136 However, LVN Pictures was forced to close shop upon the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. It resumed operations after the Liberation of Manila in 1945, and produced the first post-war Filipino movie, Orasang Ginto (1946). In 1949, LVN produced the first full-color Filipino feature film, Batalyon XIII. Dissatisfied by the color-processing of that film, De Le√≥n bought her own color laboratory for LVN. LVN Pictures saw the peak of its success in the decade following the war, hosting a stable of the most prominent film stars who had joined its studios such as Rogelio de la Rosa. In addition to producing commercially successful films, LVN also featured critically acclaimed prestige films such as Lamberto Avellana's Anak Dalita (1956), which was named Best Film at the 1956 Asia- Pacific Film Festival. In the late 1950s, LVN capitalized on the unexpected stardom of one of its contract players, the singer Diomedes Maturan who emerged as the top box-office draw of 1958‚Äì1959. =Thematic influence on LVN films= During her years at the helm of LVN Pictures, de Le√≥n retained absolute control over the operations of the studio and of the films it produced. She personally read and approved the final scripts prior to production, later with the assistance of her son Manuel. Her personal tastes dictated the themes of LVN films. Reflecting her upbringing and age, she was partial to rural romances and stories based on the traditional forms of awit and corrido, and populated her movies with Philippine folk dances. She resisted copying Hollywood trends and insisted on injecting Filipino culture into LVN films. Devoutly Catholic, she demanded that each of LVN's films contain a moral lesson. She disallowed sex scenes and permitted only love scenes that featured no more than a peck on the cheek. Her idiosyncrasies aside, de Leon used the phrase \\"Kung ano ang kikita\\" (\\"Whatever makes money\\") to justify the choices of scripts LVN adapted into film. As a result, she resisted making \\"prestige films\\" that delved into socially conscious issues. She was hesitant to produce Avellana's bleak drama Anak Dalita, and only did so at the insistence of her son, Manuel. The film earned poorly, but received several international awards which failed to mollify de Leon. She told her son, \\"Ano ngayon ang gagawin ninyo sa mga kopang iyan? Makakain ninyo ba iyan?\\" (\\"What will you do with all those trophies? Can you be fed with those?\\") =Star maker= Mila del Sol rose to stardom after being cast by Do√±a Sisang in Giliw Ko, LVN Pictures' first production De Le√≥n was known for her acumen in selecting and cultivating stars. This was manifested early on in the casting of the very first LVN film, Giliw Ko. De Leon was instrumental in the casting of the then-unknown Mila del Sol in a romantic leading role, over the objection of director Vander Tolosa who felt that the 12-year-old actress was too young for the part. Del Sol would be but the first of many Filipino actors whom de Leon would \\"discover\\" and groom for stardom. Among the other discoveries of de Leon and LVN Pictures were Charito Solis, Nida Blanca, Armando Goyena, Luz Valdez, Delia Razon, and Mario Montenegro. Razon and Montenegro were signed by LVN after De Leon espied them in bit roles in other films. De Le√≥n was a fiery disciplinarian whom, it was joked, would fall ill when she had no one to scold. She maintained a strict supervision over the behavior of her stars, restraining their spending habits by withholding portions of their salaries until their withheld pay was sufficient to buy a new house or car. De Le√≥n though would periodically hand out cash advances to LVN actresses so they could purchase new gowns. She would involve herself into the personal lives of her stars, engineering for example, the reconcillation between Nestor de Villa and his father, with whom he had become estranged after he disapproved of his becoming an actor. She frequently invited many of her actors to her Quezon City home along Broadway Street. De Le√≥n was also willing to help in manually sewing the costumes of her actresses. In line with her frugal nature, De Le√≥n was hesitant to spend on publicity for LVN films. Instead, she would develop \\"love team\\" tandems among her stars, such as Nestor de Villa and Nida Blanca, and encourage them to \\"Magpa-chismis kayo.\\" (\\"Make gossip for yourselves.\\") Lifestyle De Le√≥n was known for her extreme humility. She favored her simple rural attire even when attending the most lavish receptions, and would immediately deflect any praises directed at her. She insisted on using an old diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz even after it had fallen out of fashion and in disrepair. De Le√≥n also continued her philanthropic activities, providing for a school building to her native San Miguel, contributing to the renovation of the San Miguel Church, and even donating parcels of land in Bulacan and Cabanatuan to the needy. Despite her financial success, de Leon never learned to read English and could only speak the language at a most rudimentary level. She was however, well-versed in Spanish and Tagalog. Later years Despite the box-office success of the films of LVN Pictures in the 1940s and 1950s, it was unable to sustain financial liquidity, and by 1961, it stopped producing movies and redirected its operations for post-production services. Despite being in her eighties, De Le√≥n continued on as a film producer with Dalisay Pictures, an independent production outfit. She likewise attended to her other businesses and was active until the week before her death at age 88 in 1966. De Leon is buried at the Manila North Cemetery.

Biography and career Thosopon Sitiwatjana was born the son of Sophorn Sitiwatjana (Deceased) Ex-Police Chief and Sudsac Sitiwatjana. From the age of 5 years old Thosophon has been fascinated by martial arts including Tae Kwon Do and Muay Thai. By the age of 13 he had acquired a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. Thosophon trained in Muay Thai under Seri Ramaruud, Sanong Rakwanid and Pansak Ratanaprasit. At 16 years of age he was given his first chance to teach Muay Thai after his teacher fell ill and within just a few years he became head coach at his school. Thosophon started to adapt his training style including various capabilities of strength and style. He would train his own agility, skill and strength by wrestling crocodiles at the Samut Prakarn crocodile farm which was previously owned by his parents. Muay Thai is seen by many in Thailand as being a poor man's sport and as such Thosophons' parents were opposed to him taking part in fights. Thosophon would often sneak out and take part in bare Knuckle fights on the streets of Bangkok as well as temple fights when they were offered to him. After graduating from college Thosophon decided to audition for a role in the James Bond film \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\". In order to get the part he fought four of six students from Bruce Lees' school of Jet Kune Do. After beating four of the students the remaining two withdrew and thus Thosophon had gotten the part. He also gave special training to Roger Moore for his part in the film. After filming \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" Thosophon made his way to England in 1975. He is widely known there as the \\"Father of Muay Thai\\" where he is widely credited with introducing Muay Thai to England. Thosophon moved to Manchester where he opened a Muay Thai Gym. There he trained many fighters such as \\"Kash \\"The Flash\\" Gill\\" and Lisa Howarth but arguably his most successful fighter was Ronnie Green who became 5 time world Muay Thai Champion under Thosophon. His gym in Manchester, England is still running today and is now owned by his younger brother (himself a highly successful Muay Thai Instructor) Master A. in 1993, Thosophon left England and moved to Las Vegas, America.

Once Upon a Berlin Time: The Big Nansen, Author House, 2010. is a ski jump located along Route 16 in Milan, New Hampshire. Built in 1936, it was the largest ski jump of its time. It is now within the Nansen Ski Jump State Historic Site, a New Hampshire state park, which also features a picnic area and boat launch on the Androscoggin River. Named for Norwegian explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, the ski jump has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description Nansen Ski Jump before the restoration, 2011 The Nansen Ski Jump is just north of the Berlin city line. It was constructed in 1936 by the city of Berlin and the National Youth Administration and was once the largest of its time. The ski jump has a steel frame and is in length. It has a tower, a vertical drop, and a descent angle of approximately 37.5 degrees. The jump is approximately a K-80 jump. However, the trestle and outrun hill do not conform to modern specifications. History For almost fifty years this was the largest ski jump in the eastern United States and the foremost jump in the country. The architect of the ski jump was John Barnard Nichol, a resident of neighboring Berlin. The Nansen Ski Jump was the site of major championship ski jumping competitions. In 1938, the first Olympic trials were held at the Nansen Ski Jump. The jump was closed in 1988. In November 2011, a New Hampshire historical marker (number 227) was placed to commemorate the ski jump. Over time the ski jump evolved into a state of disrepair. In 2015, brush clearing work was started as Phase 1 torward a goal of restoring the site so visitors can view it as it once was. The state of New Hampshire owns and manages the jumping facility as a state park. In 2016 and 2017, repairs to the ski jump's decking were made by Knollstone Contracting of Bow, New Hampshire, in preparation for a celebratory jump by Olympian Sarah Hendrickson, which occurred early in the morning of March 4, 2017. In January 2019, the state agreed to allow the Friends of Big Nansen to continue renovations of the jump and to hold ski jumping and other events at the site. In February 2019, it was announced that plans were underway to return competition ski jumping to the jump.

Backward diode symbol according to IEEE 315 In semiconductor devices, a backward diode (also called back diode) is a variation on a Zener diode or tunnel diode having a better conduction for small reverse biases (for example ‚Äì0.1 to ‚Äì0.6 V) than for forward bias voltages. The reverse current in such a diode is by tunneling, which is also known as the tunnel effect.  Current‚Äìvoltage characteristics of backward diode  Band diagram of a backward diode. Electron energy is on the vertical axis, position within the device is on the horizontal axis. The backward diode has the unusual property that the so-called reverse bias direction actually has more current flow than the so-called forward bias. The forward I‚ÄìV characteristic is the same as that of an ordinary P‚ÄìN diode. The breakdown starts when reverse voltage is applied. In the case of Zener breakdown, it starts at a particular voltage. In this diode the voltage remains relatively constant (independent of current) when it is connected in reverse bias. The backward diode is a special form of tunnel diode in which the tunneling phenomenon is only incipient, and the negative resistance region virtually disappears. The forward current is very small and becomes equivalent to the reverse current of a conventional diode.  Applications of backward diodes  ;Detector: Since it has low capacitance and no charge storage effect, and a strongly nonlinear small-signal characteristic, the backward diode can be used as a detector up to 40 GHz. ;Rectifier: A backward diode can be used for rectifying weak signals with peak amplitudes of 0.1 to 0.7 V. ;Switch: A backward diode can be used in high speed switching applications.

It can be seen as analogous to gothic schools of ornamentation in carving, painting or ceremonial armoury. In terms of prosody it stands in direct contrast to plain language and its use is sometimes regarded, by current standards of literary taste, as overblown and exaggerated. But aureated expression does not necessarily mean loss of precision or authenticity in poetry when handled by good practitioners. In the British Isles, aureation has often been most associated with Scottish renaissance makars, especially William Dunbar or Gavin Douglas, who commonly drew on the rhetoric and diction of classical antiquity in their work. In the context of language development, aureation can be seen as an extension of processes in which historically vernacular languages are expanded through loan words. In Europe this usually meant borrowings from Latin and Greek. The medieval and renaissance periods were a fertile time for such borrowings and in Germanic languages, such as English and Scots, Greek and Latinate coinages were particularly highlighted (see classical compounds especially), though this has sometimes been decried as pretentious, these coinages being criticized as inkhorn terms. After Europe's colonial era widened the orbits of cultural contact, aureation could in theory draw on other ancient languages such as Sanskrit. While many classically derived loan words become useful new terms in the host language, some more mannered or polysyllabic aureations may tend to remain experimental and decorative curiosities. Words such as , , or are examples in Scots. Aureation commonly involves other mannered rhetorical features in diction; for example circumlocution, which bears a relation to more native literary devices such as the kenning. Example An example of considered diction with an aureate inflection occurs in the Scots couplet , and are aureate words. Aureate diction occurs in the noun phrase golden candle matutine, a circumlocution which stands for sun. The couplet can thus be translated as: up rose the sun with clear pure crystal light. Dunbar himself uses the term later in the same poem in a passage that employs the limits to expression topos. It occurs as part of a dream vision in which the makar is describing the army of goddesses he has witnessed alighting upon the earth: I would (attempt to) describe (the scene), but who could satisfactorily frame in verse the way in which all the fields were radiantly adorned by those white lilies (the landing army) that shone upwards into the sky? Not you, Homer, sublime as you were in writing, for all your faultlessly ornate diction; nor you, Cicero, whose sweet lips were so consistently lucid in rhetoric: your aureate tongues both (the Greek and the Roman) were not adequate to describe that vision in full.

Specifically, HT involves installation of multiple wells in an aquifer, which are partitioned into several intervals along the depth using packers. A sequential aquifer test at selected intervals is then conducted. During the test, water is injected or withdrawn (i.e. a pressure excitation) at a selected interval in a given well. Pressure responses of the subsurface are then monitored at other intervals at this well and also in other wells. This test produces a set of pressure excitation/response data of the subsurface. Once a given test has been completed, the pump is moved to another interval and the test is repeated to collect another set of data. The same procedure is then applied to the intervals at other wells. Afterward, the data sets from all tests are processed by a mathematical model to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties of the aquifer. These pairs of pumping and drawdown data sets at different locations make an inverse problem better posed, because each pair cross-validates the others such that the estimates become less non-unique. In other words, predictions of ground water flow based on the HT estimates will be more accurate and less uncertain than those based on estimates from traditional site-characterization approaches and model calibrations.

This typewriter was popular amongst journalists and students. The typewriter is sized about 34x35x10 cm (with the carriage return lever adding about 1‚Äì2 centimeters in height), making it portable at least for the time's standards, even though its 5.9 kg weight may limit portability somewhat. Mechanics The Lettera 32 is a downstrike typebars typewriter. The typebars strike a red/black inked ribbon, which is positioned between the typebar and the paper by a lever whenever a key is pressed; a small switch located near the upper right side of the keyboard can be used to control the strike position of the ribbon, in order to print with black, red, or no ink (for mimeograph stencils). Ribbon movement, which also occurs at every keypress, automatically reverses direction when there is no ribbon left on the feed reel; two mechanical sensors, situated next to each wheel, move when the ribbon is put under tension (indicating ribbon end), attaching the appropriate wheel to the ribbon transport mechanism and detaching the other. Keyboard A Lettera 32 with Arabic keyboard The keyboard uses QWERTY, AZERTY and various other layouts. Apart from the typing keys, the keyboard includes a space bar, two shift keys, a caps lock, a backspace key, margin release key, paragraph indentation key and a tab-stop set/unset key. As was common in older typewriters, it lacks the number 1, which is supposed to be substituted by the lowercase l. Popular culture Cormac McCarthy used an Olivetti Lettera 32 to write nearly all of his fiction, screenplays, and correspondence, totalling by his estimate more than 5 million words. The Lettera 32 that he purchased in 1963 was auctioned at Christie's on December 4, 2009, to an unidentified American collector for $254,500, more than 10 times its high estimate of $20,000.

Molin began his career playing in the Elitserien, or Swedish Elite League, for VIK V√§ster√•s HK. In his debut season, at just 21 years old, he played in over thirty games for the club. Molin became an important player for V√§ster√•s, and remained there for two further seasons, with his points return improving each season. In his final season with V√§ster√•s, Molin totalled 22 points in 48 games. For the following season, Molin switched clubs to play for the Bryn√§s IF, again in the Elitserien. He performed at a solid if unspectacular standard, but unfortunately was not re-signed by Brynas. He would take the opportunity to move to the U.K. and play for the ill-fated Ayr Scottish Eagles organisation, then playing in the ISL. In 15 games for the Eagles, Molin managed to net 12 points. Due to limited opportunities despite his scoring, Molin moved again and played the 2002‚Äì03 season as a TWK Innsbruck player. In 42 games in the Austrian Hockey League, Molin scored 50 points with just 24 minutes of penalties against his name. His best season to date saw him acquired in the off-season by the DEG Metro Stars of the DEL. Molin played more than 50 times for the Metro Stars but failed to find his scoring touch, managing just 5 goals and 6 assists. Despite this disappointment, Molin later found a new team and return home to Sweden to play for Hammarby IF at Allsvenskan level. He again failed to produce points on a regular basis and moved to sign for his seventh club, HC Fassa of the Italian Serie A. Molin's output improved significantly, and he scored 29 points in 42 games. His potential was spotted by Tony Hand, the player-coach of the Manchester Phoenix, who took the opportunity to bring Molin to Manchester in the summer of 2006. It was a move that ignited Molin, who provided the Phoenix with a reliable goalscorer - in 60 EIHL games, Molin totalled 83 points, with 36 penalty minutes. His first season led to Molin's signature being sought by several clubs during the off-season. Molin decided to remain in the U.K., and agreed to play for the Nottingham Panthers in the 2007‚Äì08 season. He has again started well, and so far has managed a ratio in excess of one point per game for his new team. Molin resigned for the Nottingham Panthers for season 2008/09. It was confirmed that Molin would not be returning to Nottingham for a third season in 2009-2010 . However, when Kevin Bergin failed a fitness test before a game against the Coventry Blaze, he was drafted in for a game under the new EIHL rules whereby a club could retain up to 15 players requiring ITC cards on its books providing it only iced its allotted number of imports in any one game (Molin had been visiting friends in England that week) . Later that year, in preparation for the EIHL's inaugural \\"Twenty20\\" Hockey tournament, Molin came in to assist a weakened Nottingham Panthers team in the tournament. Over the weekend of 12‚Äì13 December 2009, Molin again turned out for the Nottingham Panthers in games against the Newcastle Vipers (at Whitley Bay Ice Rink) and the Hull Stingrays (at the National Ice Centre). Molin scored a goal in regulation time against the Stingrays and again found the net as the game went to penalty shots, scoring what proved to be the winning goal. After the game against Edinburgh on 19 December 2009, it is announced that Molin would remain with the Panthers on a full-time basis until the end of the season, leaving the Panthers with two extra imports, however before he was eventually picked up by the Norwegian elite team Sparta Warriors. As he was no success, and by the fans rated the biggest mistake ever to play in the club, he was released from the Norwegians right after they were eliminated in the playoffs (went to semifinals). He produced 2 points in 8 playoff-games, and 3 points during the regular season (only played 8 games during series as well). Molin then signed for Bajen Fans IF, a supporter-operated club that was formed following the bankruptcy of Hammarby IF. He stayed for two seasons before retiring in 2012.

Founded in 2005 as Charlottetown Transit, the 150th anniversary year of the city's incorporation. It is funded by the municipal and federal levels of government and provides service throughout the city's neighbourhoods. The province of Prince Edward Island does not provide transit subsidies toward the service. The last attempt at public transit was in the form of Charlottetown Urban Transit Systems Limited from late 1979 to 1981. The name \\"Charlottetown Transit\\" was merely a marketing name and not a legally incorporated company. All buses are owned by the City of Charlottetown but are operated under contract by privately owned Trius Tours Limited. In February, 2012, Charlottetown Transit changed its name to T3 Transit - Take Transit Today. The new brand offers services to Charlottetown, Cornwall, and Stratford, as well as a Summerside and County Line Express. Most buses are designed to have the appearance of a tram or streetcar and were constructed by Dupont Industries (Thomas MVP EF Champlain 1608 LF and HF), as well as MCI Classic buses). The trolley buses are smaller than conventional transit bus designs and must be able to navigate the narrower streets and intersections in the city's downtown core. Current operations have 10 bus routes running from Monday to Friday with reduced routes on Saturday as follows: * University Avenue * Charlottetown East to West * Charlottetown West to East *Airport and Winsloe Collector * Cornwall * Stratford *QEH and East Collector * Community Bus Route 5 * County Line - Serving points between Summerside and Charlottetown * Summerside - Serving the city of Summerside In 2018, T3 Transit ran a demonstration with an electric bus, an American made New Flyer Xcelsior CHARGE.

The single was first played live at Guilfest 2007 in Guildford, England, and this live version was then released as a free download via the band's website (as was its B-side \\"345\\"). It is the first official single from the band's sixth album, Diamond Hoo Ha, and was released on 14 January 2008 as a vinyl-only single, limited to 1,500 copies, thus limiting its chances of charting, which it failed to do. An instrumental version of the song was recorded by Biff Hyman (Mick Quinn) for the Duke Diamond and Friends: Glange Fever Motion Picture Soundtrack. Danny Goffey described the character of the \\"Diamond Hoo Ha Man\\" mentioned in the song; \\"Maybe he's like a really dodgy Fear and Loathing [in Las Vegas]-type travelling salesmen ‚Äì he does his work but always has another plan in his head, something a bit seedy.

But upon hearing the song on Radio Free Europe, Berlin's Diamond Hoo Ha Men decided to create their own cinematic salute to Supergrass. Thank you & enjoy\\" This is because the other members of the band (Mick Quinn and Rob Coombes) are not present, instead Danny Goffey and Gaz Coombes take on the role of the Diamond Hoo Ha Men under their alter-egos of Randy Hoo Ha and Duke Diamond. Mick's absence was probably due to his accident in August 2007. The first scene shows Danny Goffey opening the door of a house in response to the doorbell being rung. There, additional guitarist Charly Coombes stands at the doorway, dressed as a 1970sesque badminton player under the alter-ego of Chas Harrison (ex-Middlesex County Champion Badminton Pro, now 'manager' of the band.) Charly then shouts \\"Randy, come on! Where's Duke? The car's here!\\", to which Danny calls out \\"Duke!\\" to encourage Gaz Coombes to hurry up. Gaz joins them as they progress to the Cadillac waiting outside, with pink furry dice hanging from its rear view mirror, where a chauffeur opens the car door for them all. As they drive off the song itself begins. Then footage of the Diamond Hoo Ha Men live onstage is shown, with captions of 'Duke Diamond' and 'Randy Hoo Ha' to coincide with their appearance in the video and Charly joining them onstage to hit shuttlecocks at the audience with his badminton racket (This is because Gaz Coombes is apparently afraid of feathersPickard of the pops: Diamond Hoo Ha Man by Supergrass  Music  guardian.co.uk Music). The video then changes between film of scenes such as the band live (sometimes in black outfits, sometimes in the same outfits but white), in the Cadillac, Gaz and Danny as seen through a fisheye lens camera, people with obscure clown-like masks playing table tennis and dancing and images of the two during a sunset. As the handclaps in the song begin, the camera focuses on the Diamond Hoo Ha Men's clapping hands and duplicates the image of this several times across the screen. Finally the video ends with the Cadillac driving into the sunset. Gaz Coombes plays a black Fender Telecaster Deluxe guitar throughout the video.

The precursor NPPC protein is cleaved to the 22 amino acid peptide C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).  Function  Natriuretic peptides comprise a family of 3 structurally related molecules: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), encoded by a gene symbolized NPPC. These peptides possess potent natriuretic, diuretic, and vasodilating activities and are implicated in body fluid homeostasis and blood pressure control. Unlike ANP and BNP, CNP does not have direct natriuretic activity. This is because CNP is a selective agonist for the B-type natriuretic receptor (NPRB) whereas ANP and BNP are selective for the A-type natriuretic receptor (NPRA).

The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name by Grace Zaring Stone (under the pseudonym Ethel Vance), was written by Catherine Turney. Plot summary Disenchanted poet Susan Grieve, escorted by her friend Stacy Grant, meets embittered World War II naval hero Lieutenant Slick Novak at a Manhattan restaurant where a dinner party is being held in his honor. He is more interested in Susan than his blind date Peggy Markham and offers to take her home at the end of the evening. The two become better acquainted over coffee in Susan's apartment, and she initially resists but then succumbs to his charms when he tries to kiss her. The following day, Slick returns to see Susan, and she spontaneously invites him to spend the remainder of his leave with her at her country house. In this setting, the two share secrets about each other, Susan telling him about her clergyman father's descent into insanity and eventual suicide, and how it estranged her from her mother, he confessing his longtime desire to become a priest and revealing the guilt he feels about surviving the war while others died in battle. Slick returns to the city alone, and Susan later accidentally runs into him and Peggy in the restaurant where they first met. The following day, he visits Susan's apartment and suggests they try to make their relationship work, but she urges him to reconsider the priesthood and the two part ways. Susan, having learned her mother has been hospitalized, then calls her in the hope they can reunite. Cast *Bette Davis as Susan Grieve *Janis Paige as Peggy Markham *James Davis as Slick Novak *John Hoyt as Stacy Grant *Florence Bates as Mrs. Castle *Walter Baldwin as Mr. Castle *Ransom Sherman as Mr. Roderick Moran, Jr. Production William Grant Sherry introduced his wife Bette Davis to the novel Winter Meeting and suggested it as a possibility for her next film. Davis enlisted her friend Catherine Turney to write a screen adaptation and stayed in close touch with her throughout the process, sending her memos about sequences that concerned her. \\"I am very rested and very ambitious to do something really outstanding - and I don't feel this, the way it is, answers the requirements,\\" the actress noted at one point. She later recalled, \\"Winter Meeting was a great book . . . We should never have tried to make it. This is where censorship really hurt us. We were not allowed to be honest about the differences of opinion between a Catholic and a non-Catholic. It was, therefore, a dull and meaningless film.\\" Davis spoke at length about the censorship problems with Winter Meeting in a later interview with Thomas M. Pryor of the New York Times, insisting the original story \\"would have made an engrossing film drama, but unfortunately much of the novel had to be bowdlerized to meet production code requirements.\\" From the film's trailer The casting of Slick Novak proved to be problematic. Burt Lancaster turned the role down because he didn't like the script and did not find the character to be believable. Richard Widmark tested well, but studio executives were concerned his portrayal of a sadistic killer in the previous year's Kiss of Death would make it difficult for audiences to accept him in a sympathetic role. Thirteen additional actors were considered, and of them all Davis thought James Davis was best suited for the part. New York theatrical director Bretaigne Windust had been assigned the film because of his intimate knowledge of the Manhattan social scene, but Bette Davis felt that he ultimately was responsible for her leading man's lackluster performance. \\"Because of the overanalytical approach of Bretaigne Windust,\\" she later observed, \\"Jim Davis never again during filming showed any signs of the character he portrayed in the test that made me want him for the part. No help I tried to give him could offset the effect of the detailed direction of Windust. He was lost and openly admitted it.\\" Box Office The film cost $1,927,000 and took in $1,083,000 at the box office, $880,000 domestic and $203,000 foreign. It was Davis' second film to lose money. Deception, made in 1946, was her first financial failure. Winter Meeting was her least financially successful Warners release. As a result, Jack L. Warner lost confidence in Davis as an asset to the studio, and Winter Meeting marked the beginning of her final days as a Warners star. Reception In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther opined > \\"Of all the frustrating experiences that Bette Davis has had in > films...[this] is clearly the most bewildering, not only for her but for > us... No doubt, the people at Warners thought they were doing Miss Davis a > good turn by putting her in this situation which would tax the composure of > a lady Job...But actually [their] generosity is Miss Davis' misfortune in > this case and her manner of handling the situation is much better than that > of the script...she actually catches at times some sense of a woman's deep > disturbance at a most puzzling turn in an affair of love.

Various alterations of the Barbara Gordon character, who is typically portrayed as Batgirl in mainstream continuity, have appeared in storylines published in mainstream continuity titles. These variants often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series Zero Hour: Crisis in Time, a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as Elseworlds and All Star DC Comics have also featured alternative versions of the character. The Elseworld's imprint has featured Barbara Gordon in starring roles such as the popular noir-style storyline Thrillkiller: Batgirl & Robin and the one-shot comic Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl. After DC Comics launched its All Star imprint in 2005, an alternative Barbara Gordon was adapted into Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder. In addition, another version of the Barbara Gordon character was set to star in the now cancelled All-Star Batgirl comic book series. Mainstream continuity *Zero Hour: Crisis in Time: In the company wide crossover limited series Zero Hour: Crisis in Time (1994), an alternative Barbara Gordon, unaffected by the events of Batman: The Killing Joke fights alongside the mainstream DC Universe heroes as Batgirl. During this time, she forms a strong bond with Green Arrow, the older hero seeing a lot of himself in her willingness to challenge such powerful foes as Parallax without any powers. During the struggle against Parallax, she sacrifices herself to save Damage, with her timeline being erased as the universe is re- created by the new Big Bang. As the heroes return to their own time, Green Arrow promises that, even if she never existed, she will never be forgotten. This version of Batgirl was honored with post-mortem membership in the Justice League. *Batman #666: In \\"Numbers of the Beast\\" (by Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert), Barbara Gordon is the Police Commissioner in a dystopian future Gotham.

She wears her hair short, making her appearance closer to Ellen Yindel, the commissioner in The Dark Knight Returns. Gordon dogs Damian Wayne, who has taken up the Batman mantle after the death of his father. When asked why she pursues Batman so ruthlessly, she replies, \\"That monster was responsible for the death of... of a good friend.

Following Flashpoint (2011), DC rebooted the worlds of its Multiverse; many worlds stayed conceptually or entirely the same, but several altered substantially, as part of DC's The New 52 line relaunch. *New Earth: The designated home of the Barbara Gordon who is featured in regular DC Comics continuity. Following Flashpoint, the timeline is altered and Barbara regains use of her legs. The pre-Flashpoint version of Barbara will be revisited in Convergence (2015). *Earth One: Inhabited by modernized interpretations of DC Comics' characters, featured in the Batman: Earth One graphic novel, in which a young Barbara Gordon is a 17-year-old library assistant intrigues with crimefighting and inspired to become Batman's partner, after he saved her from serial killer Ray Salinger, a.k.a. \\"the Birthday Boy\\", with her father and Harvey Bullock. She begins studying martial arts and criminology for that goal, and starts drawing herself in a female version of Batman's costume on her sketchpad. It is also implied that her mother was murdered under the order of Oswald Cobblepot. In the sequel, it is referred by her father that Barbara has enrolled to University of California, Berkeley, majoring in computer science. *Earth-2: In the setting of Earth 2 (2012-), post-Flashpoint, Barbara Gordon never served as Batgirl or partnered with Batman. As an adult, she married Richard Grayson, also a civilian, and had a son with him. Barbara's death during Darkseid's invasion of Earth later motivates her husband to train in fighting. *Earth-12: This universe mirrors the animated television series Batman Beyond, wherein Barbara Gordon is police commissioner of Gotham City. *Earth-31: Prior to Flashpoint, this is the official home of Frank Miller's \\"Dark Knight Universe\\" which consists of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again and All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder, in which a young Barbara Gordon becomes Batgirl at age fifteen. After Flashpoint. it is a post- apocalyptic waterworld and Barbara's analogue has not been depicted. *Earth-33: Following 52, Earth-33 is revealed in the series Countdown as a world of magicians, where Barbara Gordon is a true Oracle who can see the future. Following Flashpoint, The New 52 version of Earth-Prime, the world without superheroes. *Earth-37: This universe closely follows the Elseworlds limited series Thrillkiller set in the 1960s in which Barbara and Dick Grayson target corrupt cops as Batgirl and Robin. *Earth-43: This universe continues the story of the Elseworlds graphic novels Batman & Dracula: Red Rain, Batman: Bloodstorm and Batman: Crimson Mist, where Barbara Gordon is a vampire who is eventually staked by Dick Grayson. *Earth-50: This universe runs parallel to the universe of Earth-12, and is home to the Justice Lords. This version of Barbara Gordon is married to Dick Grayson, and has a teenage son. Imprints =Elseworlds= Elseworlds is an imprint of DC Comics which takes place outside of mainstream continuity. Its purpose is to take the company's iconic characters and place them in alternative timelines, places and events making heroes \\"as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow.\\" Barbara Gordon, as both Batgirl and Oracle, has made several appearances in Elseworlds comics since 1997. *Batman: Nine Lives: In the graphic novel Batman: Nine Lives by Dean Motter and Michael Lark, Barbara is a secretary working for Private Eye Dick Grayson. Nine Lives is set in the 1940s where Batman's rogues are normal criminals. Barbara is an aspiring photographer, and has a romantic attraction to Grayson. Cover to Thrillkiller: Batgirl & Robin by Howard Chaykin and Daniel Brereton. *Batman: Thrillkiller: In the Elseworlds miniseries Thrillkiller: Batgirl & Robin, Barbara Gordon is a rebellious young woman in the early 1960s. Alienated from her father, Commissioner Gordon, due to the unsolved murder of her mother, she becomes a thrill-seeking vigilante with her boyfriend, a circus acrobat named Richard Graustark, who goes by the alias Dick Grayson. Gordon is a wealthy heiress, receiving a large inheritance from the death of her mother and purchases Wayne Manor -- the Waynes having been ruined by the Great Depression. Bruce Wayne is a full-time detective in the Gotham police. A sequel, Batgirl + Batman: Thrillkiller '62, teams Batgirl with Bruce Wayne as Batman and Barbara giving up the Batgirl mantel in exchange for that of Robin, so as to honor Dick's passing. *Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl: In the one-shot comic Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl, Barbara Gordon is a wealthy novelist and a take-no- prisoners Batgirl in a world where Batman and Superman did not exist. She is darker than in mainstream continuity due to the death of Jim Gordon, who was killed when he saved the Wayne family from a street thug. Bruce Wayne becomes not only her foster brother, but also serves as her \\"Alfred\\". *Superman & Batman: Generations: Barbara Gordon is James Gordon's granddaughter in Superman & Batman: Generations and Generations II, and as Batgirl fights crime alongside Batman II (an adult Dick Grayson), who is also her lover, during the 1960s. By the 1990s, she has retired as Batgirl, and serves as President of the United States. *Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham: The H. P. Lovecraftian Elseworlds Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham features a version of Oracle. Completely paralyzed following an undisclosed accident, Barbara Gordon's artificial voicebox also gives her the power to speak to the dead. *JLA: Created Equal: In JLA: Created Equal, after all males on Earth (apart from Superman and Lex Luthor) are killed by a strange plague, Barbara Gordon becomes the Green Lantern after she is given Kyle Rayner's power ring. The ring was found by an amoral comedian named Maria Contranetti, who used the ring for her own purposes until it was taken away by the Justice League. Using the ring allows Barbara to walk again. *JLA: The Nail: In JLA: The Nail, Batgirl and Robin are brutally murdered by the Joker, who uses Kryptonian gauntlets provided by the deranged Jimmy Olsen to tear them apart while forcing Batman to watch. This drives Batman to the brink of madness and results in him beating the Joker to death. The Joker later returns in JLA: Another Nail as a demon, and intends to drag Batman to Hell with him. The Joker is once again defeated with help from the spirits of Batgirl and Robin, who convince Batman to move on from his guilt at failing to save them. *Batman: Year 100: In Batman: Year 100, Barbara has long since retired from crime-fighting, and her son James has taken over as the police commissioner of Gotham. A teenaged girl named Tora Goss now acts as the future Batman's version of Oracle. =All Star DC Comics= In 2005, DC Comics launched its All Star imprint - an ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company's most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry. All Star is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership. According to Dan DiDio, \\"These books are created to literally reach the widest audience possible, and not just the comic book audience, but anyone who has ever wanted to read or see anything about Superman or Batman.\\" *All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder: In All Star Batman and Robin #6, a fifteen-year-old version of Barbara Gordon becomes Batgirl. Reducing the character to her iconic roots, Frank Miller establishes Gordon as a thrill seeker. Her father, Captain James Gordon, has growing concern over Batman's influence in Gotham. While he praises Batman for effectively undermining the corrupt operations of the city's police department, he shows discontent over the Dark Knight's urban legend inspiring the youth of the city to emulate him. *All Star Batgirl: Batgirl was at the forefront of the list of characters chosen to receive an independent title, in addition to being given a supporting role in Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder. In an interview with Wizard magazine, comic book author Geoff Johns announced that he will team with J. G. Jones for the All Star Batgirl series. Johns stated: \\"We‚Äôre doing the first six issues, the first of which will hit in late 2007 well after J.G. and I are done with 52, so it's monthly. It's a mystery revolving around Barbara Gordon and Arkham Asylum, why she's become Batgirl and more importantly why she remains Batgirl. It's essentially our Batman: The Long Halloween or Superman For All Seasons for Batgirl.\\" This series will not follow the continuity of Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin, giving Barbara Gordon two independent featured roles in DC's All Star imprint. When asked why Batgirl would be the first character to be given an All Star title outside the DC Trinity of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Johns responded, \\"She's one of the most prominent female superheroes in the world. She's on lunchboxes, there's a Barbie of her, cartoons ‚Äî even after she's been Oracle in the DC Universe for 15 years now, people, us included, love this character as Batgirl. That's why J.G. and I wanted to do this: to focus on the first and best Batgirl.\\" =Smallville= Barbara Gordon appears in the fifth issue of the comic book continuation of the television series Smallville. In Smallville Season Eleven, she is Nightwing in this continuity instead of Batgirl or Oracle. She does however, joke about her mainstream code name, stating that she chose Nightwing instead because she hated how Batgirl sounded.DC Comics She later introduces her boyfriend Richard \\"Dick\\" Grayson to Batman as her replacement after she is selected to be a Blue Lantern. It is also implied that, prior to becoming Batman's partner as Nightwing, she dressed in a female version of her mentor's costume at a costume ball, a nod to the original character.Smallville Season Eleven: Continuity vol. 1 #4 (March 2015) =Batman: Li'l Gotham= Barbara Gordon appears at Oracle in the digital comic series Batman: Li'l Gotham by Dustin Nguyen and Derek Fridolfs. In this series, she possesses an aquatic mech suit and is fond of ice pops. She is also in a relationship with Dick Grayson (Nightwing), and they are shown getting engaged in the series finale. =The New 52: Batman '66= In the Batman '66 title, Barbara Gordon is Batgirl as portrayed in the third season of the sixties Batman show: daughter of Commissioner James Gordon and a Gotham City librarian, whose secret identity is unknown to Batman, Robin and her father. =DC Bombshells= In 2015, DC started publishing DC Bombshells, a title that places its characters in an alternate history primarily set during the 1930s and 1940s. In Digital Issue 42 (collected in Print Issue 14), Harley Quinn tells Pamela Isley about encountering \\"the Belle of the Bog\\", who appears to be a vampire version of Batgirl. DC Comics Bombshells Annual #1 (August 2016) reveals that Barbara Gourdon was a French fighter pilot during World War I. After she lost her boyfriend during the war, she traveled to Louisiana and did indeed become a vampire, and joins forces with the Ravager and Enchantress. After Francin Charles reveals that Luc Fuchs is still alive, she joins Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad. =Injustice: Gods Among Us= In the prequel comic to the game, Barbara as Oracle is a member of Batman's Insurgency, and one of his most trusted allies. It is presumed that she was in a relationship with Dick Grayson at some point before the latter's death at the hands of Damian Wayne. In Years Two through Five, she aids the Insurgency in whatever way she can, even retaking her mantle as Batgirl after Lex Luthor repairs her spine. During the second year of the conflict, Barbara loses her father, Jim Gordon, when he sacrifices himself in order to protect her. By the time Batman calls upon the help of the Prime Justice League, Barbara is left the last member of the Insurgency (the others having gone into hiding, sided with the Regime or died during the conflict). After Superman's defeat and the Regime's collapse, she continues to help Batman as he attempts to rebuild society. Crossovers *Oracle appears as one of the principal characters in JLA/Witchblade, which takes place in a continuity where the characters of DC Comics and Top Cow Productions coexist on the same Earth. In the story, it is stated that Barbara is the childhood friend of Sara Pezzini, the main protagonist of the Witchblade series. When Sara shows up at Barbara's apartment after being injured by Lex Luthor's androids, she inadvertently passes the Witchblade onto Barbara, which transforms her into a large spider- like creature. She is eventually saved when her teammates in the Justice League forcibly remove the Witchblade from her body. *In the Amalgam Universe, Barbara is combined with Spider-Man supporting character Black Cat into the character Black Bat. Barbara Gordon Hardy was an ex-thief who was determined to become a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Using her natural athletic skills to fight crime, she created a superheroic identity, the Black Bat. She quickly proved her worth to S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Bruce Wayne. Barbara was invited to join the secret organization. She falls in love with Bruce in the process. In other media *DCAU: Barbara Gordon is a recurring character in the Batman-related cartoons of the DCAU, namely Batman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, and Batman Beyond, as well as the feature films based on those shows. In this continuity, the events of The Killing Joke either never take place, or have not yet taken place; Barbara has not been paralyzed, and she does not become the Oracle (though she was meant to, temporarily, on the Justice League episode that became \\"Double Date\\").

It was written by Jennifer L. Holm, the author of another Newbery Honor book, Our Only May Amelia. It was first published by Random House. Plot  Penny from Heaven is the story of an eleven-year-old-girl named Barbara \\"Penny\\" Falucci. She believes that people call her Penny because her father, Alfred Falucci, loved the Bing Crosby song \\"Pennies from Heaven.\\" After her father's death, Penny lives with her mother, Ellie, and grandparents, Me-Me and Pop-Pop. She has her old dog Scarlett O'Hara to play with, and Penny also loves to spend time with her father's Italian family. Her father was the oldest son of her grandmother Nonny, and the only one of her six children who was born in Italy. Penny does not know why both sides of her family are distant, or why nobody will tell her her father's real cause of death. Penny's best friend is her cousin, Frankie, who is a troublemaker. Once, he persuaded Penny to lie to her grandparents and go to the public pool against her strict mother's wishes. She does not allow her to do anything that Penny considers \\"fun.\\" Frankie also steals and is frightened that he will go to jail. It is a surprise when her mother allows Penny to work in her Uncle Ralphie's meat store. Her favorite uncle, Dominic, works there as well. Though he is her favorite uncle, she sometimes wishes that he would be less eccentric. Many years ago, only Dominic supported Penny's parents' marriage while the rest of his family wanted him marry an Italian girl. Her uncle and her mom used to be good friends. Penny wants him to marry her mother and become her new father. She is disappointed when she finds out her mother is dating the milkman, Mr. Mulligan. She decides to break her mother's relationship with Mr. Mulligan, and is rude during a dinner party. She asks him uncomfortable questions and compares him to her father. One of her uncles tells Penny and Frankie that their grandfather Falucci hid money in their backyard but died before he could tell anyone his secret. They decide to find the money, and search all over the backyard. After they are unsuccessful, they want to look for the money in the basement. They wait for all the adults to leave and pretend to do laundry. Frankie finds money and is so excited. Penny is distracted and her right arm is pulled through the wringer all the way up to her armpit and is stuck, while the wringer is still going down. She wakes up in the hospital, where in a dream she hears her mother accusing her uncle Dominic for her father's death. After several weeks in the hospital, Penny still is not able to move her right arm's fingers. A doctor says that Penny's chances of remaining disabled are high. Penny wakes up at night and heard two nurses talking about her mother. They say her father was an Italian spy and was killed by the American government. When she asks her mother about this, she starts crying. Her aunt decides to tell her the truth. When Penny was a baby, her uncle Dominic bought her father a new radio. He didn't know Italians were not allowed to have this kind of radio. After Pearl Harbor, the country went crazy and all non-citizens were considered spies. Unfortunately, her father was born in Italy and was a not U.S. citizen. He got sick in the jail and died. In the last letter he wrote, \\"Baby is just like a lost penny, I'll never hold again\\". This is the real reason why everyone calls her \\"Penny\\". She realizes why her mom said Dominic killed her husband; he had bought the radio. She wants to see him and say that it is not his fault, but he never visits her in the hospital. All she has left is her lucky bean from him. The girl who lives with Penny in the same room asks to see her lucky bean. Penny wants to reach it, but loses her balance and the bean slides off the table. She doesn't want to drop it, and catches it with her fingers. She moves her fingers and believes it was a mystery of her lucky bean.  Characters  * Barbara Ann Falucci \\"Penny\\" ‚Äî age 11.

Six years later, on 30 June 1933, the Communist Party of China's Central Committee for Military Revolutionary Cases voted to declare 1 August an annual holiday, being solidified later on 11 July by the government of the Chinese Soviet Republic. Traditions Every year, the PLA Honour Guard marches on Tiananmen Square for a traditional Flag Raising Ceremony. The Central Military Band of the People's Liberation Army often gives holiday performances. Army Day is a working day, although soldiers have a shortened work schedule. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party holds an annual meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Events are hosted by the military attaches of China in foreign embassies such as the Chinese Embassy in Russia or Cambodia. Ceremonial events between the Indian Armed Forces and the PLA on PLA Day are traditionally held at the Border Personnel Meeting point. The first instance of this was in 2015. Military parades Parades held on Army Day are not very common. In 2004, the first military parade held on PLA Day took place in Hong Kong to mark the PLA's 77th anniversary.

The company has since moved to the Wall Street area in 2013. After 140 years, the company remains a family-owned business, publishing both performance and educational music for students, teachers, and virtuosos. Carl Fischer's composers and editors give clinics and sessions all over the country, and the company claims to serve more than 1400 retailers around the world. History =1870s into the 20th century= In 1872, Carl Fischer opened his musical instrument repair shop in the East Village neighborhood of New York City. Noticing that many of his customers were searching for instrumental arrangements of well-known works that didn't exist, Fischer began creating and reproducing arrangements, which led him into the music publishing business. Carl Fischer became the pre-eminent publisher of music for concert band composers such as Percy Grainger, John Philip Sousa and the famous transcriptions of Erik W. G. Leidz√©n and Mayhew Lake. Carl Fischer also was a Musical Instrument Dealer, and imported wooden flutes made by Emil Rittershausen, Berlin Germany, from the 1890s to 1914. Rittershausen is well documented in the New Langewell Index of musical instruments. In 1910 Fischer won the importation rights for woodwinds manufactured by Buffet-Crampon of France. In 1929 the C.G. Conn Ltd. corporation acquired the musical instrument department from the company, maintaining the Carl Fischer retail operations as a consortium between Conn and the music publisher under the Carl Fischer name. Instruments from various leading manufacturers of the period were sold under the Carl Fischer house brand. Walter S. Fischer, son of the founder and President from 1923-1946, sits at his desk in the 1940s. As the company grew and diversified, Fischer's three sons joined the team: Carl, Jr., Walter S. and George. In 1924, Carl Fischer Music was invited to be a member of ASCAP, adding the company's publications to a respected network of artists and composers. The company continued to grow, necessitating the building of Carl Fischer's new headquarters in 1926, located in Cooper Square, Manhattan. This building housed administrative offices and a sprawling retail store. =1930s and 1940s= Walter S. Fischer succeeded his father as President of Carl Fischer Music in 1923 and in 1939 his son-in-law, Frank Hayden Connor became his assistant. Though they began contributing in the 1920s, it was the 1930s and 1940s that were marked by the significant contributions of works and arrangements from classical music superstars such as Mischa Elman, Jascha Heifetz, and Joseph Szigeti. Frank Hayden Connor became the president of the company and opened Carl Fischer's second retail location, which also housed a beautiful concert hall, in midtown Manhattan. This five-story building was the largest music store in New York City until it was sold in 1959. In 1940 the company acquired the York Band Instrument Company for $300,000. Production at the York facility was switched over to munitions during World War II and the York brand was subsequently downgraded to budget lines of instruments provided by various suppliers. =1950s through the 1970s= Notable additions to the catalog during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s include significant works by Howard Hanson, Norman Dello Joio, Lukas Foss, Peter Mennin, Douglas Moore, Alliene Brandon Webb, and Anton Webern. During this period, Carl Fischer Music represented Oxford University Press, Paterson's of London, Henle Verlag of Germany, Cundy-Bettoney, Eastman School of Music (containing music by then- director Howard Hanson), the Fillmore Music catalog (containing Henry Fillmore's marches), and the Charles Foley catalog (containing the compositions of Fritz Kreisler). =1980s and 1990s= Walter Fischer Connor became President and Chairman of the Board, as well as Chairman of Boosey and Hawkes, a British music publishing company, for a short time. During this time, Carl Fischer Music developed the Rack Sense program, the first sophisticated computerized system for stocking music stores with high-turnover print music product. Composer Andrew Balent created the Sounds Spectacular series for band, a forerunner in the area of music for young bands. It was also during the 1980s and 1990s that Carl Fischer Music began to publish the works of fast-rising composers such as Henry Brant, Michael Colgrass, Sebastian Currier, Jason Eckardt, Daron Hagen, Lee Hyla, Martin Bresnick, David Carlson, Paul Lansky, Daniel S. Godfrey, Samuel Jones, and David Maslanka. In 1999, F. Hayden Connor, the great grandson of founder Carl Fischer, became chairman, and music publishing icon Sandy Feldstein was hired to lead the firm into the 21st century. Carl Fischer Music moved its corporate headquarters to the landmark Bayard-Condict Building in the NoHo neighborhood of Greenwich Village. =2000s - present day= The 2000s began with the launch of the Performance Series for school concert band and string orchestra, featuring innovative original works and arrangements, organized by grade level for directors‚Äô ease of use. In 2008, BriLee Music joined the Carl Fischer choral catalog. Carl Fischer Music also continues to release enhanced editions of essential methods such as the Wohlfahrt Violin Studies, the Rose Studies for Flute and Clarinet, and many others. Former TMEA president and active educator Denise Eaton joined the editorial team in 2011 as choral editor. Carl Fischer Music is under the leadership of CEO Sonya Kim. In 2013 the Carl Fischer Music administrative offices moved to 48 Wall Street.

The Wildings were a series of definitive postage and revenue stamps featuring the Dorothy Wilding photographic portrait of Queen Elizabeth II that were in use between 1952 and 1971. The Wildings were the first and only British stamps to feature graphite lines on the back, and the first to feature phosphor bands on the face ‚Äì both aids to automation. The stamps were also the first British pictorial high value stamps and the first to include regional emblems. Design history The stamps reproduced a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II taken during a photographic session on 26 February 1952 by Dorothy Wilding, who had been working at the Royal Court since 1937.\\"The Life of Dorothy Wilding\\", Stamp Magazine website, retrieved 21 November 2007. Archived here. Seventy five designs were considered to frame the portrait and five basic designs by Edmund Dulac, Enid Marx, Mary Adshead, Michael Farrar- Bell and George Knipe were selected. Four symbolic flowers of each country of the United Kingdom were also depicted, imitating one of the definitive stamp designs of King George VI's reign. Dorothy Wilding's photograph depicts The Queen wearing the State Diadem made for George IV in the 1820s, which was designed to be worn outside a Cap of Maintenance. This diadem was also worn by Queen Victoria on stamps such as the Penny Black. The original photograph was re-touched to bring the diadem further forward on The Queen's head. The replacement of the Wildings was initiated by stamp designers Michael Goaman and Faith Jacques. In a letter sent to the Post Office in April 1961, they expressed the difficulty of including the large Wilding portrait in their designs for commemorative stamps and the fact that the Queen was half turned to the viewer was also felt to be unsatisfactory. They proposed an image that would represent the monarchy more than the person of the queen.Letter kept by The British Postal Museum & Archive (code POST 122/10703), quoted in Muir, Douglas (2007). A Timeless Classic, chapter 2, \\"A Portrait with problems\\", pages 15‚Äì17. In 1963, comparing the Wilding portrait with Jacques' proposed design, the Stamp Advisory Committee acknowledged the need for a replacement,Muir, Douglas (2007). A Timeless Classic, pages 17‚Äì19. and in 1967 the stamps were replaced by the Machin head though the design continued to be used for regional issues until decimalisation in 1971.  Low values  A 3d Wilding Overprinted with black bars for use as a training stamp, 1954 or later. Eighteen values ‚Äì in d increments up to 3d, 1d increments (plus d) up to 1s, 1s 3d and 1s 6d ‚Äì were issued starting with the d and d on 5 December 1952. All were printed in photogravure by Harrison and all were perforated 15 (more accurately ) √ó 14. Three separate watermarks were used: * Tudor crown + E2R (1952 to 1954) * St. Edward's crown + E2R (1955 to 1958) * St. Edward's crown (1958 on) For brevity these are known as 'Tudor Crown', 'St. Edward's Crown' and 'Crowns' (or 'Multiple crown') respectively. The Tudor crown watermark was replaced because the dandy roll was worn, and the St. Edward's Crown watermark was replaced because of the introduction of Scottish regional issues and perceived sensitivities as Elizabeth is the first Elizabeth to rule Scotland not the second. As well as the normal upright watermark ‚Äì on values up to and including 4d ‚Äì the stamps are also found with inverted, sideways and sideways inverted watermarks from booklets and coils. The original cream paper was changed to white from April 1962 resulting in two variants of the 'crowns' watermark stamps. The 6d is also sometimes found on slightly pinkish paper. Several of the values are found in a variety of shades, the most obvious being a red brown and a dark red brown for the 2d and two distinct blues for the 4d. There are also two distinct dies of the d red, easily distinguished by the outlining of the central gem on the Queen's crown.  Technical innovation  Automatic Letter Facing (ALF) was introduced on an experimental basis in 1957 so as to automatically orient envelopes for postmarking. The original system used graphite lines on the back of the stamp. This was later (1960) replaced by a system based on detecting phosphor bands on the face of the stamp following an intermediate stage of both phosphor and graphite lines. The first phosphor lines were 'green'. For technical reasons 'green' phosphor was replaced by 'blue' phosphor (1961) and finally 'violet' phosphor (1965). The significant distinguishing feature is the afterglow time ‚Äì 'blue' 20 sec., 'green' 10 sec., 'violet' 5 sec. ‚Äì rather than the colour as such.Uvitec Minor Instruction leaflet  High values  The castles high value definitive stamps of Great Britain. In 1955 four large format high values ‚Äì Castles ‚Äì designed by L. Lamb were introduced. These were the first true British pictorials ‚Äì previous designs, for example the 1953 Coronation issue, had all featured symbolic designs ‚Äì and showed the Wilding head plus a castle. The four were: * 2s 6d ‚Äî Carrickfergus Castle * 5s ‚Äî Caernarvon Castle * 10s ‚Äî Edinburgh Castle * ¬£1 ‚Äî Windsor Castle All stamps were recess printed on a variety of papers. Three separate printers, Waterlow (up to 1957), De La Rue (1958 on) and Bradbury Wilkinson (1963 on), were used. Two watermarks ‚Äì St. Edward's Crown and Crowns were used. All stamps were perforated 11 √ó 12 (more accurately ).  Regional issues  A British regional stamp for Guernsey. Regional issues (also known as Country Definitives), for Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man, were first introduced in 1958. Whilst the Wilding head was common to all stamps the frames differed in that they incorporated regional symbols such as the Scottish thistle or the Welsh dragon. The stamps remained in use longer than the national Wildings. The Guernsey and Jersey stamps were withdrawn in 1969 when these islands became postally independent; the others at decimalisation. Due to this extended life later issues had no watermark ‚Äì mirroring the Machins. Otherwise technical details are as for the national Wilding issues.  Other uses  In addition to their use in the United Kingdom both low and high values were overprinted for use in North Africa (Morocco Agencies, Tangier) and the Middle East (Bahrain, Kuwait, Muscat, Qatar).  Commemoration  In 1998, a commemorative booklet was produced by the British Post Office containing new Wilding stamps in decimal currency, and in 2002 and 2003 miniature sheets were issued each containing stamps in the Wilding style. The commemorative miniature sheet of definitives issued by the Royal Mail for the 2012 Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II included one stamp with photography by Dorothy Wilding based on the 1952 design by Edmund Dulac.

Timberlake (born October 18, 1943) is a former American football player who played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1962 to 1964 and for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) in 1965. Timberlake was the starting quarterback for Michigan who led the Wolverines to the 1964 Big Ten Conference championship and a 34‚Äì7 victory over Oregon State Beavers in the 1965 Rose Bowl. Timberlake was selected as a first-team All-American in 1964, received the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten, and finished fourth in the 1964 Heisman Trophy voting. Over his three years at Michigan, Timberlake rushed for 315 yards and passed for 1,507 yards. He was responsible for 19 touchdowns, eleven rushing and eight passing. He also served as the team's punter and placekicker with six field goals, 36 extra points, and a total of 121 points scored. After a brief career in professional football, Timberlake became an ordained Presbyterian minister. Even during his football career, Timberlake was outspoken about his Christian faith. He has also been active in Habitat for Humanity. Since 2003, he has been on the faculty of Marquette University where he teaches courses in community service and affordable housing. College football Timberlake was born in Middletown, Ohio, but he was raised in Franklin, Ohio and played football for the Franklin Wildcats. He was originally recruited as a halfback and played more than any other Michigan player at halfback in 1962. However, he was later switched to the quarterback position and had his greatest success there. =1964 regular season= In 1964, Timberlake led the Wolverines football team to their first Big Ten Conference championship since 1950, breaking the longest championship drought in school history. Playing quarterback, Timberlake's total offense of 1,381 yards (807 passing and 574 rushing) was the second highest in Michigan history at that time. The 1964 Wolverines outscored their opponents 235‚Äì83, finished the regular season 8‚Äì1, and narrowly missed an undefeated season with a 21‚Äì20 loss to a Purdue Boilermakers team led by sophomore Bob Griese. By virtue of turnovers, Purdue led 21‚Äì14 with five minutes remaining. Timberlake ran an option play to the left side and went 54 yards for a touchdown. Rather than kick the extra point for the tie, Timberlake carried again on the option play to the right, but was tackled one foot short of the goal line, and two points short of an undefeated season. When Michigan and Ohio State met in Columbus, Ohio on November 21, 1964, both teams were in the Top 10 in the national rankings. Michigan had not beaten Ohio State since 1959. Michigan won 10‚Äì0, as Ohio native Timberlake was responsible for all ten points, including a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jim Detwiler and a fourth-quarter, 27-yard field goal to clinch the game. =1965 Rose Bowl= Rose Bowl. The Wolverines (ranked No. 4) advanced to the Rose Bowl where they defeated Tommy Prothro's Oregon State Beavers, 34‚Äì7, on New Year's Day. Prior to the Rose Bowl, much of the attention was focused on Michigan's veteran quarterback. The Pasadena Star- News wrote that Timberlake was \\"the key\\" to Michigan's attack: \\"He does everything--run, pass, kick field goals, soup up the team‚Ä¶Timberlake has had that strength. The Wolverines listen to him and they believe in him. At 6‚Äì4 and weighing 215 pounds, Timberlake is a Lincoln to look up to.\\" Mel Anthony scored three touchdowns for Michigan, and Timberlake and the Wolverines gained 415 yards in the game. Timberlake was 7-for-10 passing for 77 yards, and added 57 yards rushing, including a 24-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. =Post-season honors= At the end of the 1964 season, Timberlake was awarded the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference. He placed fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting (losing to Notre Dame's John Huarte), and was also named to multiple All-American teams. After attending an All-American dinner at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Timberlake reported, \\"There is a great deal of loneliness in being an All- America. . . . I get sick of it. They all want to shake your hand, but they don't really know you. All they do is stick out the glad hand. I don't mind talking to anyone who is interested in ideas, but nothing makes me sicker than having my name dropped by people who don't know anything about me except that I'm an All-America.\\" He joked that he might write an autobiography called, \\"The Loneliness of an All-America.\\" He was also an A-minus student majoring in sociology, was named a scholar-athlete by National Football Association, and was placed on the Big Ten All-Academic team two years in a row. Religion in Timberlake's life Timberlake was outspoken during his time in the limelight about the importance of his Christian faith. Timberlake taught Sunday school in Ann Arbor while attending the University of Michigan and said he intended to become a Presbyterian minister. At a speech in Mansfield, Ohio, shortly after winning the Rose Bowl in January 1965, Timberlake said, \\"I couldn't have played football if it hadn't been for Jesus Christ.\\" He continued, \\"God changed my life. He promises the abundant life, which he has given me, and eternal life, which if I die I'm sure I will have. There's peace associated with being a Christian.\\" Timberlake also spoke openly of his personal conversion as he walked in a parking lot while on a night watchman's job at a Chevrolet plant in Warren, Michigan. Timberlake defined a Christian as \\"one who has Christ as his personal savior,\\" and not just a person who was brought up in a Christian home or goes to church. When he signed a professional football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated that he intended to take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off- season. He noted, \\"I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete.\\" He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: \\"I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it.\\" Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. He recalled that those 20 minutes were \\"horrible.\\" \\"You want to go home. You want to quit football. It is times like these when something happens to me. I can't explain it. I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace.\\" When a boy asked Timberlake for his autograph at the Giants' rookie camp in 1965, Timberlake signed his name but also wrote citations to two Bible verses: John 3:16 and 1 Peter 1:5‚Äì9. The boy asked, \\"What's that?\\" Timberlake explained they were Bible verses, and he told reporters he started doing it about six months earlier, hoping the kids would look up the verses. In 1965, such public religious expressions were not common among athletes, and columnists made note of the fact that Timberlake \\"packs a Bible in his suitcase and keeps one in his locker.\\" While playing for the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: \\"I'm playing football to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football. I guess you can say my goal is to spread a Christian message.\\" At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that \\"you don't need to hurt anyone to get by\\" in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. He then joked, \\"There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence.\\" Professional football The New York Giants drafted Timberlake in the third round of the 1965 NFL Draft. He signed a two-year contract with the Giants for an estimated $85,000 ($12,500 per year base plus $60,000 in bonuses and fringe benefits). Timberlake turned down offers from the Buffalo Bills in the American Football League and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Canadian Football League because he had an opportunity to compete for a starting job with the Giants. Future Pro Football Hall of Famer Y. A. Tittle‚Äôs tenure with the Giants was over, and Timberlake was expected to compete in a new system that would emphasize rushing quarterbacks. Timberlake did not get the quarterback spot with the Giants and was assigned as kickoff specialist; he was also used as a kicker on long field goals for the 1965 NFL season. In a nationally televised game on October 3, 1965, at Pittsburgh, Timberlake hit a 43-yard field goal in a 23‚Äì13 win. Timberlake‚Äôs kick against the Pittsburgh Steelers was the last field goal by any Giants kicker that season. Early in an October 24 game against the Cleveland Browns, the Giants' main placekicker twisted an ankle. Timberlake took over as the team‚Äôs full-time kicker until the season‚Äôs final week. Timberlake went 0-for-14 in field goal attempts for the rest of the season, and three of his shorter attempts were blocked. Though he went 1-for-15 in field goal attempts, Timberlake converted all but one of his extra points. After his one miss, he said: \\"I‚Äôm the guy who put the suspense back in the extra point.\\" In the 1966 pre-season, Timberlake was third on the Giants' depth chart at quarterback. In the September 1966 issue of the Sporting News, Timberlake lamented: \\"I‚Äôm not doing anything. For four days the other week, I didn‚Äôt throw a single pass. Not a single pass.\\" After just one season, the Giants cut Timberlake from the team on August 29, 1966, at their camp in Fairfield, Connecticut. In an article concluding that Timberlake may have been the worst placekicker in NFL history, the writer concluded: \\"Timberlake‚Äôs 1-for-15 performance makes him look like a laughingstock. He‚Äôs better remembered as one of Michigan‚Äôs great quarterbacks, a Rose Bowl hero who might have had what it took to be a fine pro quarterback or running back. It‚Äôs a shame he was asked to do what he couldn‚Äôt.\\" Sports blog Deadspin ranked Timberlake the 2nd-worst player to ever play in the NFL, only behind quarterback Rusty Lisch.The Bottom 100: The Worst Players in NFL History. Deadspin. Retrieved August 14, 2014. =Impact on the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger= Because of Timberlake's poor performance as a kicker in 1965, the Giants signed Buffalo Bills kicker Pete Gogolak in 1966, who was also football's first soccer-style kicker. Previously, kickers kicked the ball straight on instead of at a soccer-style angle, which improved accuracy and is the standard at all levels of football today. This ended a \\"gentleman's agreement\\" between the NFL and the AFL in not signing each other's players, and would start a rash of signings that would eventually led to the two leagues merging. In an NFL Films documentary featuring Timberlake, Steve Sabol called Timberlake the \\"father of the Super Bowl\\", because his poor performance indirectly led to the two leagues merging and the Super Bowl being formed. Life after football Timberlake went on to become an ordained Presbyterian minister and a hospital administrator at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, which is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 2003, Timberlake joined the faculty of Marquette University where he teaches courses on community service and faith, and mentors the student Habitat for Humanity chapter. In 2007, Timberlake said he saw the community service course as \\"an excellent opportunity to bring along the next generation\\" to address problems of neighborhood blight, poverty, family disorganization, failure in school, and incarceration for African-American males. He described the problems facing the poor as \\"a colossal, colossal waste of human life.\\" Timberlake has been a volunteer for several years with Milwaukee's Habitat for Humanity chapter, and one of the courses he teaches at Marquette is called \\"Decent and Affordable Housing,\\" in which students are instructed in construction methods (and use of power tools), investigate the causes of hyper-segregation, study substandard housing as a social injustice issue, and spend part of the semester at a Habitat for Humanity work site helping to build a house. The course is taught through the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, which has hired Timberlake as an adjunct professor. Timberlake, who is not an engineer by trade, has overseen the construction of eleven garages through the project. Timberlake is a proponent of gay marriage.

Biography Cornish was a child prodigy graduating from the University of California, Berkeley with honors at the age of 18 and receiving a doctorate by the time he was 22. He worked on various projects including one that allowed for reading newspapers under water with special lenses. In 1932 he became interested in the idea that he could restore life to the dead. The cornerstone of his plan consisted of a teeterboard or see-saw that was used to get the blood flowing in the recently deceased patients while a mixture of epinephrine (adrenaline) and anticoagulants was injected into their circulatory system. In 1933 he attempted to revive victims of heart attack, drowning, and electrocution with the teeter board, but had no success. Cornish decided to perfect his method on animals and managed to revive two dogs (Lazarus IV and V) clinically put to death on May 22, 1934 and in 1935.

The homestead is a Vermont State Historic Site owned by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, a state agency, and is open for tours from May to October. Description and history The Morrill Homestead is set on of land on the east side of Justin Morrill Memorial Highway, just south of the village green and the heart of Strafford Village. The property includes, in addition to the main house, several barns and sheds as outbuildings, and is set off from the road by a flush-boarded fence with granite posts, all painted a reddish color. The main house is a rambling 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, set on a brick foundation. The walls are finished in flushboarding, and it has a steeply-pitched slate roof. Portions of the roof are decorated with vergeboard, finials, and crenellated parapets. The interior features elaborate mahogany woodwork, and is predominantly Gothic Revival in character (matching the building's exterior), although the main parlor is more Greek Revival in character. Original furnishings and Morrill family possessions remain in the house, from the furniture to linens and kitchen implements. The interior walls have seen only minimal alterations, which have generally been limited to maintenance such as new coats of paint. Exterior alterations are similarly modest, including the replacement of rotted trim elements with matching materials. The house in 2003 The main construction phase of the house was between 1848 and 1851, and was personally overseen by Justin Morrill to his own design. Its year of completion was also the year of Morrill's marriage to Ruth Barrell Swan, with whom he had two children. Morrill primarily used the house as a summer residence, as a spent much of his time in Washington, DC, where he died in 1898. The property remained in the Morrill family, with little alteration, until World War II, when the property was sold to a concern planning to establish a boarding school. This plan was quickly shelved, and the house was then acquired by preservationists, who sold it to the state in 1969. Morrill's primary legacy to the nation consists of two landmark pieces of legislation, both bearing his name. The Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890 respective established and expanded on the concept of the land-grant university, by which the federal government gave land (and in the 1890 act, funding) to the states for the establishment of universities. These acts made possible the establishment of a significant number of state-run universities, as well as a few private schools that were contracted to the state to fulfill the requirements needed to receive the federal grants. Other significant accomplishments by Morrill during his long tenure in Congress include seeing through the completion of the Washington Monument, the construction of the Library of Congress Building, and the landscaping of the United States Capitol Building grounds.

Tanner Co. Early life and education Tanner was born in Farmington, Utah to Joseph Marion Tanner and Annie Vilate Clark. His mother was Tanner's second (polygamous) wife, and they spent their wedding night apart because of the Federal government opposition to polygamy. O.C. Tanner was the youngest of Annie's 10 children, and he would later publish her memoirs as A Mormon Mother: An Autobiography by Annie Clark Tanner. It details how his father, exiled to Canada because of his practice of polygamy, was a fading presence in the life of his son. Annie struggled to survive financially, and O.C. felt a responsibility to contribute financially from an early age, doing odd jobs that included stoking furnaces at the university to pay his tuition. One of the persons whose fires he maintained showed him how to enter the jewelry business, and he started selling seminary graduation pins and class rings from the back of his car. He founded the O.C. Tanner Co. in 1927, while he was still an undergraduate‚Äîa company that is now one of the largest manufacturers of retail and corporate awards in the U.S. He married Grace Adams in 1931. He completed his B. A. degree in 1929 at the University of Utah, his L.L.B., also from the University of Utah in 1936, his M.A. from Stanford University in 1937, and his J.D. degree from the University of Utah in 1967. He has received numerous honorary degrees from Utah universities and colleges. The family foundation endowed the University of Utah Obert C. and Grace A. Tanner Humanities Center. Tanner took an interest in Mormon studies and once offered Fawn Brodie, famous for her psycho-biography of Joseph Smith, $10,000 for a similar biography of Brigham Young. Professional career, awards and philanthropy In 1927 he founded O.C. Tanner Co. by selling class rings and pins to graduates.

He was the author or co- author of 10 books, including New Testament Studies, The New Testament Speaks, Christ‚Äôs Ideals for Living, and co-author of Toward Understanding the New Testament. His autobiography One Man's Journey: In Search of Freedom, discusses his views about his commitment to learning and freedom. Tanner was a recipient of the National Medal of Arts and an honorary fellow of the British Academy, Oxford University, and Cambridge University. In 1978, he permanently endowed the Tanner Lectures on Human Values, which are presented annually at several universities in England and the United States. He enjoyed donating fountains, often to universities and hospitals, which can be found at the University of Utah, Stanford University, Westminster College, Primary Children's Hospital, among others. Tanner contributed enormously to Utah's cultural community, chairing the commission that planned the construction of Abravanel Hall, the Utah Art Center, and the restoration of the Salt Lake Capitol Theatre. He also served on the Utah American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, the Utah Symphony Board, and the White House Conference on Children and Youth. Tanner collaborated with his friend Gordon B. Hinckley to create and endow the O.C. Tanner Gift of Music concert series which began in 1983 and continues. These free concerts, combining the world class talents of the Utah Symphony and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, build unity and enhance the arts in the Wasatch Front communities of Utah.

The school has two academically oriented general upper secondary programmes: * the 3-year Upper Secondary School Leaving Examination (STX) and * the 2-year Higher Preparatory Examination Course (HF) Both programmes prepare pupils for further studies and, at the same time, they develop the pupils' personal and general competence. The programmes aim to enhance the pupils' independent and analytical skills as well as preparing them to become democratic and socially conscious citizens with a global outlook. The programmes comprise a wide range of both compulsory and optional subjects at different levels. The curriculum and examinations must follow national standards and are subject to external evaluation. Apart from subject-specific oral and written examinations, students must also prepare one or two major written assignments. Admission requirements for STX are 9 years of basic school as well as certain subject requirements. For HF, admission requirements are 10 years of basic school or the equivalent thereof. STX is for those aged 16‚Äì19, whereas HF attracts both young people and adults.  History  Svendborg Gymnasium was founded in 1872. The school was originally located in Bagergade, one of Svendborg‚Äôs oldest streets. To begin with the school offered an elementary programme with a school-leaving examination. In the 1909 the new Education Act was introduced, restructuring the educational system in Denmark. Hence the upper secondary school was founded and the first class from Svendborg Gymnasium graduated in 1912 with six students only. The official opening of the extension at Svendborg Gymnasium & HF, 2006 Throughout the years the school's ownership changed from private to public and the ever-growing number of students result in the relocation of the school, twice. In 1932 the school was moved to a new building at Vieb√¶ltet and in the 1970s the school was relocated again to its present location at A.P. M√∏llersvej. In 2006 a new extension was added and a new sports centre was built. The school has had several different names throughout the years: * Svendborg Realskole 1872‚Äì1912 * Svendborg Realskole og Gymnasium 1912‚Äì1920 * Svendborg Statsskole 1920‚Äì1932 * Svendborg Statsgymnasium 1932‚Äì1986 * Svendborg Gymnasium 1986‚Äì2007 * Svendborg Gymnasium & HF 2007 - The School's Headmasters List of Headmasters * 1872‚Äì1914: Johannes Moeller * 1914‚Äì1927: Axel Mossin * 1927‚Äì1942: Dietrich Petersen * 1942‚Äì1952: Karl Nielsen * 1952‚Äì1960: Poul Kierkegaard * 1960‚Äì1979: Ejnar Sneskov * 1979‚Äì2005: Ole Visti Petersen * 2005-: Jesper Vildbrad The current headmaster Jesper Vildbrad graduated from the Universities of Odense and Copenhagen in History and Sports.

Intranet  Svendborg Gymnasium uses a learning management system, Fronter, which enables the students and the teachers to communicate with each other. Furthermore, the system allows for the provision of online learning and online assessment. All students have access to a wireless connection from anywhere at school. In recent years an increasing number of students have brought their notebooks to school, thus allowing for a flexible learning environment. Students also get easy access to virtual tools such as dictionaries, article archives and online libraries.  The Sport Centre  Free sport activities: volleyball, basketball, handball, ultimate etc. Ultimate is not very common in Denmark, but the students at Svendborg Gymnasium are very talented and might become a great ultimate-disc-team in Denmark. Svendborg Gymnasium has qualified for the next national cup for secondary schools. The new sport centre, Gymnasiehallen, is also used for throwing the big annual dance party for all students and staff, The Lanciers. The entire school and parents participate in this yearly event.  Student Democracy  The students are represented in all councils and committees set up by the school which deal with matters of interest to them. Also, they have representatives on the school board. Furthermore, each class is represented by two students in the students' council which has a meeting once a week. These meetings are led by the two presidents who are elected by the students themselves. In the student council everything that concerns the daily life at the school is discussed, and subsequently, students' proposals are brought forth in the relevant committees or to the headmaster.  BAENK  BAENK is the school paper of Svendborg Gymnasium and is run by the students. The origin of BAENK is unknown.

Thorne had Karen move in with him and his wife Macy Alexander. Throne admit having feelings for both of them and Karen won. Karen also befriended Brooke Logan. Thorne went back to Macy and Karen began a friendship with attorney Connor Davis. Sheila Carter wanted more power in Forrester Creations and by taking a picture of Karen and Connor kissing and got Connor fired but when Karen admit he was just a friend Shelia's plan failed.

Karen felt terrible, made peace with Connor, and returned Spectra to Sally Spectra before leaving L.A. =Becoming Co-CEO of Spencer Publications= It was revealed that Karen had been working for her father at Spencer Publications in New York City. Stephanie called her to offer her condolences about the death of her father. She was present for the reading of her father's will where in it, he bequeathed 50% of Spencer Publications to her and the other 50% to her half-brother Bill Spencer Jr. She and Bill Jr. were also named the successor Co-CEOs of Spencer Publications. Although Karen was hesitant to assume the role, Stephanie assured her she would do a fine job. Karen then decided to stay around town and befriended Nick Marone. Karen attended her half-brother's wedding to Katie Logan in November 2009. She left town again shortly after, and focused on running the East Coast division of Spencer Publications back in New York. She returns in for Katie's surprise vow renewal ceremony in 2011. =Return to L.A. & Coming Out= Karen had a surprise of her own: a grown-up daughter she named after her late twin sister. Caroline was a budding designer that Brooke recruited to work with her son, Rick Forrester, in an attempt to keep Rick away from his scheming ex-wife, Amber Moore. Caroline moved to Los Angeles in 2012, and was soon followed by Karen and Karen's friend, Danielle. Karen invites Caroline and her boyfriend, Thomas over. However, Karen insisted that Caroline keep the \\"family secret\\" when Thomas kept asking about Caroline's father. But Caroline finally convinced Karen to admit that Danielle was her spouse and Caroline's second mother. Thomas took the news in stride, but Karen was adamant that Bill not discover she had come out as a lesbian, even as Karen arranged to have Danielle interview with Bill for a job at Spencer. Caroline later reveals to Thomas that Karen's father wanted Karen to marry a junior executive at Spencer Publications but she refused. When he found out about Karen's relationship with Danielle, he refused to meet Danielle or acknowledge that Karen had a partner. He also forced Karen to keep it a secret from everyone, including Bill Spencer, Jr., and nearly disinherited Karen. With Danielle's encouragement, Karen finally found the courage to come out to Bill. Bill accepted Danielle into the family. Months later, Karen and Danielle rushed to Caroline's side when she fell over a balcony during an argument with Bill. Caroline swore it was an accident, but Karen, among others, couldn't help wondering if Bill had pushed Caroline. When it's revealed that Bill had an affair with his sister-in-law, Brooke Logan, Katie divorces Bill and, as part of the settlement, Katie receives 1% ownership of Spencer Publications. Karen and Katie combine their stock, fire Bill from Spencer Publications and make Katie CEO of Spencer Publications. Many months later, with Spencer faltering under Katie's leadership, Brooke and Bill approached Karen, asking her to reinstate Bill as CEO. Karen appreciated Bill's efforts to change, but she opted to keep Katie in the position. However, Brooke had kept papers Bill once tricked Katie into signing, documents which would give Bill joint custody of his and Katie's son, Will, as well as control of Spencer Publications again. Brooke had stopped Bill from filing them, but now used them to force Katie to relinquish the CEO position to Bill. =Return to New York= Karen once again leaves L.A. for New York, this time leaving with Danielle. The two make their home in NYC once again, with Karen back to running the East Coast operations of Spencer Publications. Karen and Danielle later hosted Caroline for an extended visit.

With \\"The Third Planet\\", he produced two albums, \\"Kurdistani\\" and \\"The Third Planet\\". The band gave numerous concerts in Italy. In 1997 his collaboration with Lapo Lombardi and Ranieri Cerelli lead to the \\"Alkemya\\" project, releasing an album with CNI. In 2000 he created his own label, Hot Elephant Music. At the same time, he and Ludus Pinsky (Lapo Lombardi) explored new sounds and technologies, resulting in the production of Underwater Caf√©. He also produced E.A.S.Y. vol.1 (Elephants Are Sometimes Young). In 2002 he returned to the \\"Electro\\" style of his musical d√©but, producing \\"Oh no...Robotnick\\" in collaboration with Max Durante. The album, despite its dark humor, so typical of Robotnick's early tracks, was insufficiently disco-dance and fashion-conscious and therefore received mixed reviews. In 2002 he released \\"Melt in Time\\", the third album by The Third Planet in collaboration with Nazar, Paolo Casu, Arup Kanti Das and Smail Kouider. In April 2003 he started to DJ, an activity he had never previously considered. In summer 2003 he worked with Kiko and The Hacker on a new track, \\"Viens Chez Moi\\".

Kinley is the author of illustrative charts and the book Elohim the Archetype (Original) Pattern of the Universe. The illustrations and book document his belief that Yahweh-Elohim is the archetype pattern by which every aspect of life, law and matter can be explained and verified. Students of the Institute study these in an effort to gain an understanding of the purpose, pattern and plan of Yahweh-Elohim for themselves and to present the teaching in the simplest manner to others. The principal laws are applied to the various natural sciences, physics, cosmology, ontology, current human events, as well as what is written in the Bible. These fields of study and their co- relationship are made apparent by this archetype providing proof of the existence of Yahweh, humans inseparable relationship with this source, and the operation of a purpose and plan.http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Jhn&c;=10&t;=KJV#34http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&c;=1&t;=KJV#27 Early Life & Ministry Henry Clifford Kinley was born in Greenville, Kentucky to Ada Luvenia Higgins and George Edward Kinley. After moving to Springfield, Ohio, his father worked as a drayman at Wickham & Chapman Piano Plate Company. He left school during the 6th grade to work at Wickham & Chapman and later became a master molder. Kinley entered the Ohio National Guard during World War I. He also joined the Church of God in Christ in Springfield, Ohio. He quickly advanced in the ministry, becoming an assistant pastor and a member of the General Council. He was well known as a healer, preacher and a \\"walking bible\\"; being able to quote any chapter and verse in the Holy Scriptures. Over the years he became a member of the Masonic Order (3rd Degree) and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Archetype Pattern of the Universe The Springfield Interdenominational Bible Ecclesia was formed in 1932 in Springfield, Ohio by Henry Clifford Kinley and Carl Franklin Gross. A series of charts were created to illustrate the operation of a single, archetype pattern documented in the Holy Bible and operating throughout history and the sciences. The first chart was successfully created on a bed sheet in 1932. Kinley named it the Chart on the Pattern or Plan of Salvation (known to the school's students as the Elementary Chart) and was illustrated according to a threefold pattern containing 10 principle laws and several concurrent cycles. The second chart that was made was entitled Elohim the Archetype (Original) Pattern of the Universe, and is also known as the Moses Chart. Additional charts on chronology, religious and political history, and how man is made in the image and likeness of Elohim were created. All of these charts (and others) are similar to the ones copied and used in all of the schools today. To view the only available video footage of Henry Clifford Kinley explaining this philosophy, go to YouTube Channel: Archetype Pattern. Institute of Divine Metaphysical Research On October 11, 1935 the Kinley Divinity School was legally incorporated as a non-profit corporation in the State of Ohio. The Articles of Incorporation listed several trustees and a purpose: \\"...is not for profit but to promote the cause of the Christian religion; to operate a school to prepare students for the ministry and laymen for scientific study to better understand and serve both God and their fellowmen...\\" Another name change for the school came in the 1940s while the founder was living in Cincinnati, Ohio. The school was renamed the Kinley Institute of Divine Metaphysical Research, Incorporated and the duties of headquarters was held between those in Springfield and Cincinnati. Several years later, in 1958, after moving to Los Angeles, California for the express purpose of getting the teaching into motion picture, headquarters has remained in Los Angeles, California. The school was legally established as a separate organization and renamed the Institute of Divine Metaphysical Research. The Kinley Institute was then dissolved in Ohio and all schools became branches of the Institute in California. Introduction to Divine Metaphysical Philosophy and the Divine Pattern of the Universe, Dr. Henry Clifford Kinley (c.1950s) Beliefs of Followers The Institute of Divine Metaphysical Research has acquired many followers during Henry Clifford Kinley's(God Himself) life and long after. At some point during the organizations lifetime the belief that Henry C. Kinley is the physical manifestation of Yahweh started circling in the minds of its members. After his death in 1976 his successor Dr. Robert Harris, took up the mantle as \\"Dean\\" of the \\"school\\". After this time it became a widely held belief that Dr. Harris was the physical embodiment of Yashuwa (Jesus) before his death in 2018. Followers also believe in a concept known as \\"birth son\\". A \\"birth son\\" is never clearly defined, however the closest analogy may be \\"one who is chosen to enter heaven after death\\". This is similar to the belief of PredeterminationDeterminism held by CalvinistsCalvinism . Though their belief is related to Predeterminism, they also believe that one's vessel can be saved if Yahweh places a \\"righteous\\" spirit within one's body. It follows that followers of IDMR also believe that everyone who is not \\"spiritually cleansed\\" is what they refer to as a \\"negative three fold entity\\", and the belief is that most of the human population fits this description. Though it is not clearly stated how one can become \\"spiritually cleansed\\" by the will of Yahweh, followers are encouraged to attend sessions at IDMR during their free lectures 3 days a week where prominent leaders attempt to interpret passages of the bible, occasionally in conjunction with the speakers personal ideological beliefs as well as misinterpretations of physics, chemistry, and biology. These speakers are typically referred to as \\"Dr.\\" even though most do not possess PhD's or Medical Degrees of any kind.http://theunadulteratedtruth.net/audio-files/ External links * ThePatternOfEverything.Org is a free, searchable library maintained by the family of Dr. Henry Clifford Kinley. * YouTube Channel: Archetype Pattern film recorded in 1958 of Henry Clifford Kinley.

It is located about 24km northwest of the city of Yorkton along the Yellowhead Highway.  History  Springs of pure water along the old Dakota trail attracted settlers to make the present site of Springside, a main stopping place on their trek farther west. The CP railway line was laid parallel with this trail and the siding was named Patrick in honour of the Yorkton district pioneer doctor, T. A. Patrick. The first settlers in the vicinity of the village were from the British Isles or from Ontario, also of British extraction. To the north east of Springside, Ukrainians homesteaded and to the northwest, German-speaking peoples made homes on their claims. By 1903 the railway was under construction and a post office was being considered for the newly incorporated village however another community in the territory was already named Patrick so it was decided that the name should be changed. The presence of the springs beside the trail prompted the residents to petition the Post Master General to call the post office Springside. F. H. Willis was appointed post master that summer and received the first batch of mail on July 1, 1904. The Saskatchewan government declared Springside a village in 1909. During the Great Depression the Yellowhead Highway was built linking Springside to nearby Yorkton through the efforts of A. C. Stewart, Minister of Highways and Member for Yorkton. As a result, many businesses and services began to close down as people travelled to Yorkton to shop. In 1985, Springside officially became a town.  Education  Springside has one school that covers Kindergarten through grade 8 in the Good Spirit School Division. Enrollment for 2008 is 95 students. Attractions Springside is close to Spiritwood Acres 18-hole golf course and Good Spirit Provincial Park as well a Theodore Dam.

Early life Ulrich was the third son of Duke Albrecht VII and Anna of Brandenburg. Ulrich was educated at the Bavarian court. Later, he studied theology and law in Ingolstadt. After the death of his father, he took up residence in B√ºtzow and succeeded his cousin Duke Magnus III of Mecklenburg- Schwerin as Lutheran administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin in 1550. Later, he married Magnus's widow, Elizabeth, a daughter of King Frederick I of Denmark. His wife was actually a first cousin of his maternal grandmother Elizabeth of Denmark, daughter of John, King of Denmark. They were first cousins, twice removed. After the death of Elizabeth he married Anna, daughter of Philip I, Duke of Pomerania. After the death of his uncle, Henry V, Duke of Mecklenburg, Ulrich participated in the national government, especially during Mecklenburg's participation in the Schmalkaldic War. It erupted from an inheritance dispute, which was settled by the \\"Ruppiner dictum\\" of the Elector of Brandenburg. Reign On 17 February 1555, Ulrich succeeded his brother John Albert I in partitioned Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. In 1556, he received, while maintaining common state government with his brother, the eastern part of Mecklenburg with the capital in G√ºstrow, while John Albert received the western part with the residence Schwerin. After the death of his brother in 1576, Ulrich was made guardian of his offspring, among them his nephew and successor in G√ºstrow John Albert II. Ulrich built the castle at G√ºstrow as his principal residence. Ulrich embodied an educated, modern prince, and was a devout Lutheran. He developed into one of the leading princes of the Mecklenburg dynasty. He left behind, at his death, a fortune of about 200,000 guilders. Ulrich participated in the exchange with Tycho Brahe and David Chytraeus in the scientific discourse of his time and corresponded with humanists like Heinrich Rantzau. In 1594, as Chief of Lower Saxony imperial circle, he organized military and financial assistance against the Turkish threat. In the dispute between Frederick II of Denmark and his brother-in-law Duke John Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp Ulrich served as a mediator, having excellent relations to both. As Administrator of the Prince- Bishopric of Schwerin he was succeeded by his grandson the last Bishop of Schleswig, Prince Ulrich of Denmark (30 December 1578 ‚Äì 27 March 1624 in R√ºhn), who married with Lady Catherine Hahn-Hinrichshagen. Ulrich's granddaughter Anne of Denmark married James VI of Scotland. In 1598 James VI was anxious to secure the throne of England. He sent his ambassadors to his wife's family and allies, to discuss his right to Elizabeth's throne and that the Princes of Europe should supported him against Spanish claims, with military help if required. Ulrich wrote to James on 20 August with a letter of cautious support, counselling that Elizabeth should name him her successor, and was lukewarm on a definite pledge of arms.Annie I.

The Vostochny Cosmodrome ( Kosmodrom Vostochny \\"Eastern Spaceport\\") is a Russian spaceport (still partly under construction) above the 51st parallel north in the Amur Oblast, in the Russian Far East. It is intended to reduce Russia's dependency on the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The first launch took place on 28 April 2016 at 02:01 UTC. As of July 2019, five launch attempts have been made with four successes.http://russianspaceweb.com/meteor-m2-2.html  Location  Vostochny (which means \\"eastern\\" in Russian) is in the Svobodny and Shimanovsk districts of Amur Oblast in the Russian Far East, on the watershed of the Zeya and Bolshaya Pyora rivers, approximately from the Pacific Ocean, depending on launch azimuth. The planned total area is 551.5 km2, being a region approximately 30 km in diameter centred on . The nearby train station is Ledyanaya and the nearest city is Tsiolkovsky. The cosmodrome's latitude, 51¬∞ north, means that rockets will be able to carry almost the same amount of payload as they can when launched from Baikonur at 46¬∞ N. Other arguments for choosing this location include the ability to use sparsely populated areas and bodies of water for the rocket launch routes; proximity to major transportation networks such as the Baikal‚ÄìAmur Mainline and the Chita‚ÄìKhabarovsk Highway; abundance of electricity production resources in the area (necessary for hydrogen rocket fuel electrolysis and liquefaction); and the infrastructure supporting the former Svobodny Cosmodrome, on which the new spaceport will be based. The site's location in the Russian far eastern region allows for easier transport of materials to the site, and allows rockets to jettison their lower stages over the ocean. It was expanded as part of a plan to modernize the supporting infrastructure. Russian president Putin said that among places offered was an area on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, near Vladivostok, but that experts recommended not to locate it there since the proximity to the ocean can create problems and delays in launches, and as a result the current site was chosen.  History  Russian president Vladimir Putin made several statements emphasizing the importance of the new cosmodrome. In August 2010 he said, \\"The creation of a new space center... is one of modern Russia's biggest and most ambitious projects\\". In January 2011, he ordered the government to complete the paperwork as soon as possible so that construction can start on schedule. The general designer of the cosmodrome is Ipromashprom (Mechanical Engineering Project Institute). The main contractor is the Federal Agency for Special Construction. Construction of the cosmodrome began in January 2011 and was expected to be completed in 2018. During a visit to the site in July 2011, the newly appointed chief of Roscosmos, Vladimir Popovkin, promised 20 billion rubles for Vostochny during 2012. A month later the head of Spetstroy, Grigory Naginsky, told the press that the first blueprints for the center went through the project expertise and the first contract worth 1.6 billion rubles was signed with Roscosmos, covering construction of a railway line and a road. Naginsky also promised completion of the initial makeshift housing for construction workers at the site by 1 October 2011. Although the Angara pad at Vostochny had originally been planned for completion in 2018, as part of the second phase of construction of the new launch center, Dmitry Rogozin announced in January 2013 that the Angara would fly from Vostochny earlier, in 2015. However, Roscosmos announced in November 2014 a postponement, saying that the first unmanned test mission of Angara would not launch until 2021. Over 100 construction workers went on strike to protest unpaid wages in March and April 2015. Following corruption allegations and findings by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office that \\"a number of labor laws have been violated during the construction. [Vladimir Putin said he is] taking personal control of the cosmodrome's construction\\". In June 2015, the installation of support equipment and assembly of the first floor of the command post of the Vostochny Cosmodrome was handed over to specialists from the Centre for Operation of Space Ground-Based Infrastructure (TsENKI). In October 2015, it was announced that parts of the assembly complex for the Soyuz-2 rocket were designed for a different variant of the rocket and were too small, so the planned launch date of the first Soyuz-2 from Vostochny Cosmodrome in December 2015 was under review. A spokesperson for a Russian government space infrastructure agency reported that \\"work with the rocket at the integration and testing complex now can not be conducted because the facility is not ready\\", and added that \\"there are still imperfections in the construction\\". However, later this information was disproved by the cosmodrome's operation centre and the rocket was set into the facility. The first launch of a Soyuz-2 rocket from Vostochny took place on 28 April 2016. = Construction = The construction of residential buildings in Tsiolkovsky, Amur Oblast, next to Vostochny Cosmodrome. The President of Russia Vladimir Putin in Vostochny Cosmodrome, on 14 October 2015 Early plans projected that seven launch pads would be built at the site, including two for crewed flights. On 1 September 2009, Medvedev signed Presidential decree No. 562 designating Spetstroy as the cosmodrome's sole construction contractor. Construction began in January 2011 and was expected to be completed by 2018. Russian engineers looked to apply knowledge gained from building the Soyuz launch facilities in Kourou spaceport and the Angara pad at Naro Space Center in South Korea. As a cost-saving measure, no defensive military structures like those at Baikonur cosmodrome will be built at Vostochny. More than 400 social, engineering and transport infrastructure facilities, of roads and of railway lines are projected to be built at the cosmodrome. In December 2011, ARMS-TASS reported with reference to the director of the Federal Special Construction Agency, Grigory Naginsky, that hotels and barracks were being constructed within the cosmodrome. Regarding housing plans, he noted that a town for 40 thousand people would be built near the cosmodrome. In January 2012, a Russian Government Decree signed by Prime Minister Medvedev transferred of forest lands in the Amur Oblast for construction of the spaceport from Shimanovsky and Svobodensky districts. On 2 March 2012, Deputy Prosecutor General Yuri Gulyagin said at a meeting with the Presidential representative in the Far Eastern Federal District Viktor Ishayev that timely payment of wages, as well as registration of vehicles and people involved in the construction of the cosmodrome, will soon be the focus of regulatory authorities. According to him, construction of the launch site should not be admitted to the violations that were in the construction of the 2012 APEC Summit projects. As noted at the meeting, the number of workers and organizations each month will only increase, and therefore requires strict control. The number of employees at the facility by the end of 2012 was projected to increase from 5,000 to 7,000. In April 2013, Minister of Far Eastern Development Viktor Ishayev said that 2014 will be the busiest year in the construction period and the number of workers will rise to 7,000. He also said he was sorry for the delay in reconstructing and developing worker residence sites that were handed over by the Russian Ministry of Defense in Tsiolkovsky. On 12 April 2013, which is Cosmonautics Day in Russia, Putin suggested naming the town that will be built near the cosmodrome after the founder of theoretical astronautics Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, saying that there was not a single locality in Russia bearing the name of the scientist. Later it was decided to assign this name to Uglegorsk, the nearest city. In November 2013, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported that the three-month delay that existed in July was reduced by November to 10 days. By this time the first stage of the project, the construction of roads at the cosmodrome, had been completed. , more than 4,000 personnel, 680 pieces of construction equipment and vehicles were working at the site. With personnel working on a rotational basis, the overall number of people involved in the project had reached 5,246. In December 2013, specialists chose sites for Angara facilities at the cosmodrome and transported the mockup of a carrier rocket from Moscow-based Khrunichev Space Center to the spaceport. In March 2014, Russia's federal network grid operator FGC UES completed the first phase of power supply to the cosmodrome. The first phase consists of a modernized \\"Ledyanaya\\" 220 kV substation which connects power receivers for complex structures to the Unified National Power Grid. In the same month, Spetstroy said it was hoping to finish building the launch pad for Soyuz-2 carrier rockets before the end of July 2015. In July 2015, reconstruction of the Ledyanaya railway station was completed; it includes a garage, service and domestic building and treatment facilities, 20 new turnouts and communications systems. In the shortest possible time, an extension was built to the post of electric interlocking and high loading platform, in addition to the construction of railway stations Promishlennaya-1 () and Promishlennaya-2. They are located within the territory of the cosmodrome. On 25 September 2015, the first rocket destined for a launch at Vostochny Cosmodrome arrived by train. The rocket, Soyuz-2.1a, was planned to launch in December 2015. The launch took place on 28 April 2016. On 23 January 2019, Roscosmos cancelled the agreement with the troubled PSO Kazan company to build the launch pad for the Angara rocket in Vostochny. Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has harshly criticized Director General of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin and the top brass at the state space agency: \\"We should stop the project-mongering, quit blabbing about where we'll fly to in 2030, we should work, talk less and do more\\", Medvedev said.  Launches  Soyuz-2.1a from Vostochny Cosmodrome, 28 April 2016. The first launch at the complex occurred on 28 April 2016, at 02:01 UTC, when a Soyuz-2 launched from pad Site 1S, carrying the gamma-ray astronomy satellite Mikhailo Lomonosov. The second launch occurred on 28 November 2017, also from Site 1S, with a Soyuz-2.1b/Volga upper stage carrying Meteor-M No.2-1. The mission was declared a failure after telemetry was lost and the rocket re- entered the atmosphere due to the Fregat upper stage being programmed for a launch from Baikonur rather than the new Vostochny Cosmodrome. The third launch occurred on 1 February 2018 from Site 1S, with a Soyuz 2.1a. It was successful.https://www.roscosmos.ru/24635/ On 27 December 2018, the fourth launch from Vostochny, using a Soyuz 2.1a, was conducted. The primary payloads were two Russian government Earth observation satellites, Kanopus-V 5 and 6. Also aboard were 26 small satellites that were deployed as secondary payloads. The launch of these small satellites was organized by GK Launch Services, a commercial subsidiary of Roscosmos. The fifth launch took place on 5 July 2019. The Soyuz-2 rocket delivered weather satellite Meteor-M2-2 into orbit.  Purpose  The new cosmodrome will enable Russia to launch most missions from its own land, and reduce the dependency of Russia on the Baikonur Cosmodrome which is leased from the government of Kazakhstan. Currently, Baikonur is the only launch site operated by Russia with the capability to launch crewed missions to ISS or elsewhere. The Russian government pays a yearly rent of $115 million to Kazakhstan for its usage. Satellites bound for geostationary orbit and high inclination orbits can be currently launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia. The new site is intended mostly for civilian launches. Roscosmos plans to move 45% of Russia's space launches to Vostochny by 2020, while the share from Baikonour will drop from 65% to 11%, and Plesetsk will account for 44%. In 2012, the share of space launches from the territory of Russia stood at 25%. By 2030, this figure is projected to increase to 90%.  Economic aspects  Development of the Vostochny Cosmodrome is expected to have a positive impact on the economy of the relatively poorly developed Russian Far East. The Russian government has a strategic policy to bring high-tech companies into the Far East region, and several enterprises involved in human space flight are expected to move their activities there when the new cosmodrome is completed. Development of the new site is also expected to dramatically increase employment in the towns of Tsiolkovsky, Shimanovsk, Svobodny and others. According to a 2009 estimate, the construction will cost 400 billion rubles (US$13.5 billion). Along with the launch pads and processing facilities, an airport and a satellite city will be constructed. The city will be designed to accommodate 35,000 people as well as tourists. It will contain a full supporting infrastructure with schools, kindergartens and clinics. Architect Dmitry Pshenichnikov has stated that the city is to become a \\"one-of-its-kind scientific and tourist space town with a unique design and a beautiful landscape\\". When completed, the cosmodrome will permanently employ 20,000‚Äì25,000 people. In November 2012, press reports indicated that the Russian government is having difficulty in finding a good use for the new spaceport, and that other government ministries have been avoiding the project, calling it a \\"dolgostroy\\", which is Russian for an \\"endless construction boondoggle\\". = Controversies = Corruption severely set back construction of the new Vostochny Cosmodrome. According to Russian prosecutors, at least $165 million was embezzled during the construction process (critics claim that these numbers are severely downplayed), and in 2015, 350 workers painted giant messages on their barracks, asking Vladimir Putin to help after long payment delays. The current price of the spaceport is $7.5 billion with costs rising every year (for example, an additional $105 million was requested in 2016).https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/vostochny-cosmodrome-russian- space-project-isn-t-going-plan-n618846 Launch pads Seven launch pads are planned to be built at Vostochny over several years.

He is said to have trained with the minor artists Damiaan Wortelmans II and Hans Biermans. Larder with two figures Van Herp may have spent some time abroad after his training. He was listed as an independent master in the Guild of St. Luke beginning in 1637. He spent his entire career in Antwerp. He married Artus Wolffort, daughter of the painter Artus Wolffort. He was the father of Norbertus en Willem (II) van Herp, who both became painters, and daughters Maria Anna and Anna Maria.Jahel Sanzsalazar, Van Herp, Willem van (Antwerpen, 1614-1677), in: Allgemeines K√ºnstler-Lexikon, Band 72, pp. 319-321 He was the master of Norbertus van Herp and Melchior Hamers. Work =General= Van Herp painted mainly genre scenes and religious compositions. It is not possible to discern a development in his style since he only dated a few of his pictures. His style is characterised by its somewhat mannered way of drawing and the expressiveness of the figures. His large output point to a large workshop with an almost industrial operation. Tavern with merrymakers and card players Many of his paintings can be regarded as copies or pastiches of original compositions by Antwerp painters such as Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Gerard Seghers, Jan Boeckhorst, Hendrick van Balen, Erasmus Quellinus the Younger, Gaspar de Crayer and Artus Wolffort as well as of Italian masters such as Raffael and Guido Reni. =Typical works= Typical examples of his work are the painting A Poor Company at Table in a Rustic Kitchen held by the National Trust at Tyntesfield and oil on copper religious paintings, such as Daniel in the Lion's Den (c. 1650, Los Angeles County Museum of Art). In the former, a genre scene, the figures demonstrate a small- scale use of Rubensean figures in an interior reminiscent of contemporary works by David Teniers the Younger. A poor company at a table in a rustic kitchen The latter is more representative of the small religious scenes on copper that make up most of his oeuvre, with a highly polished finish and borrowings from Rubens' treatment of the same subject. He also painted large altarpieces of churches in Flanders such as in Antwerp, Herentals, Ostend and Londerzeel. Many of his paintings can be regarded as copies or pastiches of original compositions by Antwerp painters such as Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Gerard Seghers, Jan Boeckhorst, Hendrick van Balen, Erasmus Quellinus the Younger, Gaspar de Crayer and Artus Wolffort as well as of Italian masters such as Raffael and Guido Reni. He often worked from prints made after the works of these masters to create his own compositions. An example is the Baptism of Christ (Prado Museum), which is based on a print after Rafael.J. J. P. P., Herp, Willem van at the Prado Museum website =Collaborations= A bordello scene with ladies carousing and drinking with their client As was the custom at the time, he regularly collaborated with other painters. He worked with Jan van Kessel the Elder, Lambert de Hondt the Elder and Guillam Forchondt in the production of landscapes (painted by the other artist) with figures (painted by van Herp). Examples are The departure of the Israelites, St. Anthony Preaching to the Animals and Noli me tangere. These paintings are similar in composition and are a variation of the type of the so-called 'paradise landscape'. Paradise landscapes depict the Garden of Eden as described in the Book of Genesis, filled with all the animals, fish and birds that were believed to be God's creation. The type was invented and popularized by Jan Brueghel the Younger.Lambert de Hondt the Elder (before 1622-before 1655) and Willem van Herp the Elder (1613/14-1677), Saint Francis with the Animals at Haldane Fine Art =Works on copper= Although only moderately successful in Antwerp, as suggested by the infrequent occurrence of his paintings in local inventories, many of his small works were probably intended as export items destined for Spain.Jes√∫s √Ångel S√°nchez Rivera, \\"Sobre una serie de cobres flamencos de pintores en la estela de Rubens\\", Anales de Historia del Arte, vol. extraordinario: \\"Saberes art√≠sticos bajo signo y designios del \\"Urbinate\\"\\" (2011), pp. 483-505 Most of these were on copper, a material for painting that was highly prized both for durability and its glossy finish in Spain. Van Herp's works were also influential in spreading copper painting in Mexico by way of trade from Spain to Latin America, and reflect a taste for small paintings reminiscent of Rubens' style abroad. He also became well known in England through engravings after his works, in particular of his genre scenes.J. de Maere, Jennifer A. Martin, and Marie Wabbes.

Brussels: Renaissance du livre, 1994; p. 210. =Tapestry designs= Saint Anthony of Padua distributing bread Van Herp also produced designs for tapestries. In 1663 he was together with Jan van Kessel the Elder, David Teniers the Younger and Luigi Primo one of the painters who painted on copper a six-part series representing the history of the Moncada family. These were used as designs for tapestries manufactured in Brussels.Margarita Garcia Calvo.

Biography Coat of arms of Lodovico Jacobini Born in Genzano, Lodovico Jacobini studied at the seminary in Albano before being ordained to the priesthood in Rome on September 23, 1854. He then furthered his studies at the Sapienza University in Rome, where he obtained his doctorate in theology (July 20, 1857) and his doctorate in civil and canon law (June 25, 1858). Jacobini then entered the Roman Curia, serving as a staff member in the Secretariat of Ecclesiastical Affairs. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness, and also became Secretary of the Congregations of Propaganda Fide, which at that times also was responsible for relations with Oriental Rites. In 1862, he was appointed secretary to the first commission for the preparation of the Syllabus. Later named a canon of the Lateran Basilica, Jacobini served as a referendary on the Apostolic Signatura as well. In 1867, he was charged with the weighty task of gathering and publishing the answers of the world's bishops to the questionnaire for the preparation of the First Vatican Council. During the Council, Jacobini was secretary of the preparatory commission for Church discipline, also serving as Undersecretary of the Council from 1869 to 1870. On March 20, 1874, Jacobini was appointed Titular Archbishop of Thessalonica by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 24 from Cardinal Costantino Patrizi Naro. He was named Nuncio to Austria three days later, on March 27, 1874. Pope Leo XIII created Jacobini Cardinal-Priest of S Maria della Vittoria in the consistory of September 19, 1879. He was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Austrian Order of Sankt Stefan in 1880. On December 16 of that same year, Jacobini was appointed Vatican Secretary of State (essentially the Pope's prime minister) and Administrator of the Wealth of the Holy See. The Cardinal died in Rome, at age 55, from an illness that had lasted nearly two years. Buried on March 6, 1887, he is buried in the Chapel of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide in the Campo Verano cemetery.

It is also called UFT or UFUR.  Description  UFT is a first generation dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitory fluoropyrimidine drug. It is an oral agent which combines uracil, a competitive inhibitor of DPD, with the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) prodrug tegafur in a 4:1 molar ratio.  Mechanism of action  Excess uracil competes with 5-FU for DPD, thus inhibiting 5-FU catabolism. The tegafur is taken up by the cancer cells and breaks down into 5-FU, a substance that kills tumor cells. The uracil causes higher amounts of 5-FU to stay inside the cells and kill them. Tegafur is a type of antimetabolite. Uracil has also been stated to help protect the gastrointestinal tract from 5-FU toxicity and the related metabolites, with less side effects than 5-FU and other 5-FU related (pro)drugs. Tetrahydrofuran metabolites from the tegafur metabolism, unique among 5-FU based drugs, have also been shown to improve the antiangiogenic and cytocidal performance of 5-FU, particularly in patients with over-expressed HIF-1.  Trial results  Trials using UFT for cancer treatment include pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and breast cancer with significant gains over existing treatments, with reduced side effects, improved quality of life, improved disease free survival and/or overall survival. History The UFT combination was developed in Japan during the 1980s. UFT is approved in over 50 countries as a cancer therapy, most commonly for advanced colorectal cancer to replace 5FU, and has a low cost. \\"[P]atients appeared strongly to prefer treatment with [oral] UFT/LV over [intravenous] 5-FU/LV.\\" In Japan, UFT is approved for cancer treatments including tumors of the colon/rectum, lung, breast, stomach, head and neck, liver, gallbladder, bile duct, pancreas, bladder, prostate, and cervix.

She was arrested for murder and fraud, and was sent to trial in one of the most famous cases in the Victorian-era. Scandal Emma Cunningham was a young woman in New York City when she married a widower, George Cunningham in 1835. When he died in 1852 his life insurance policy amounted to $10,000, a tidy sum. As an attractive widow, she met Dr. Harvey Burdell, a prosperous dentist and rented a suite of rooms in his mansion as did other tenants, such as John J. Eckel (later to be accused as an accessory). It was intimated that Cunningham was sexually involved with both of these men. Dr. Burdell resided and practiced dentistry at his townhouse on 31 Bond Street in New York City, one of the most affluent blocks in pre-Civil War New York. This area declined rapidly in the mid-century and only a few traces of the thirty-five Greek Revival homes remain. Burdell, like his neighbors, was very wealthy, although his reputation was far from sterling as he was accused of embezzlement, reneging on debts and causing a scandal on his wedding day by demanding money from the bride's father who was enraged and canceled the wedding. Murder On the morning of January 31, 1857, Dr. Burdell's servants discovered his body in his office, at 31 Bond Street, covered with blood, brutally stabbed multiple times and strangled. Upon police interrogation, some of the servants testified that they heard angry words between the victim and his assailant the night before. The police determined that Dr. Burdell had been stabbed at least 15 times by an assailant who was left-handed. Since Emma Cunningham was left- handed, she was an immediate suspect and was arrested for Burdell's murder and imprisoned for trial. Trial The trial, at its time, was as notorious as the O.J. Simpson trial was in the 1990s and was accompanied by a media circus akin to such trials today. A reputed 8,000 people tried to cram into the church for the funeral and Cunningham reportedly threw herself dramatically on Burdell's casket. During the first evening of the Coroner's investigation, on January 31, 1857, Mrs. Cunningham produced a certificate of marriage revealing that she and Dr. Burdell had been married on October 28, 1856. This gave the prosecutor a suspected motive for murder, for as wife, she would inherit his fortune. Dr. Burdell's estate was estimated at $100,000, which included the townhouse where he was murdered, and various other real estate. All the members of the household, including servants and Emma Cunningham and her family were placed under house arrest by Coroner Edward Connery, as was custom at the time. After a fourteen-day coroner's investigation, which took place in the parlor of 31 Bond Street, the case was delivered to a grand jury, where Emma Cunningham was indicted for the murder of Dr. Burdell. She was placed in jail awaiting her trial. The top defense attorney, Henry Lauren Clinton, represented Emma Cunningham. The New York City District Attorney, Abraham Oakey Hall was the prosecutor. Hall later became Mayor of New York City in 1869. At the murder trial, which began in May 1857, there was much testimony from all sides. Cunningham did not testify. One of Burdell's maids testified that she had called him a bad man who was not fit to live. A man named John Eckels, a boarder at the home of Dr. Burdell, was labeled an accessory to the murder, but testimony to his actions was not heard during Cunningham's trial. Also, all testimony to the marriage certificate was not heard, as its validity was being tested in the Surrogate's Court. Burdell's widely known unsavory reputation made accusation against Cunningham difficult for the prosecutor to make credible. On May 9, 1857, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty and Cunningham was free to go. Baby scandal After Emma Cunningham's acquittal, she was permitted to return to the townhouse on 31 Bond Street, pending a hearing and decision of the Surrogate's Court to determine if in fact her marriage to Dr. Harvey Burdell was valid, and if that entitled her to his house and other property. At the time, marriage was conducted by a clergyman, and witnessed, but was not registered with any office of the state to make it legal and valid. The marriage certificate in question was signed by a clergyman, both parties and two witnesses. The clergyman recalled the event. The only way to invalidate the marriage was to prove that it was an imposter and not Dr. Burdell himself who appeared to be married. The Surrogate's decision on the matter of the marriage and the inheritance was scheduled for August 1857. Prior to that decision, a scandal erupted involving Emma Cunningham. It was purported by District Attorney Oakey Hall that Cunningham had \\"procured\\" a baby by paying $1000 to declare a false heir, with the father as Dr. Burdell. This would entitle her to all of Dr. Burdell's fortune, instead of just her widow's share. The prosecutor and chief of police raided her home and removed Cunningham, who was delirious and under the influence of drugs. Also present was a doctor and a baby that had been marked under the arms with acid, as it had been prepared by the district attorney prior to the sting. The \\"baby scam\\" had been engineered by the district attorney, and the doctor who testified to the events was his close associate, Dr. de la Montagnie, who was also the godfather of Hall's daughter. Emma Cunningham was briefly taken to the Tombs, the New York City jail, where she had already spent two months while awaiting the murder trial. Her defense attorney, Henry Clinton, had the charges swiftly dismissed based on lack of evidence of a crime, and due to entrapment. Cunningham was again released. To this day it is unclear if the 'baby scam' was fabricated and engineered by the district attorney or if Emma Cunningham was delusional and engaged in the act of attempting to buy an heir. It would be an unlikely move for her to attempt when she was already in line to split a significant fortune with Burdell's relatives. All of the testimony and reportage of her claimed pregnancy was after-the-fact hearsay and never verified as fact. However, the judge in the Surrogate's case was negatively influenced by the incident, and ruled that Emma Cunningham, although acquitted of any wrongdoing, would not inherit any money or property from Burdell's estate. From August 1857 onward, Emma Cunningham was a free woman; however her reputation was forever tainted, as she would always be suspected of being involved in the infamous murder. By the end of that year, she was penniless and eventually moved to the West Coast. She returned to New York City in 1887, where she died at the home of a cousin; she was 69. Her death was reported in the New York Times on September 18, 1887. During the following century, many of the accounts of the murder repeated the disproved or uncorroborated hearsay that had, at the time of the trial, been eliminated from the court proceedings as hearsay or corrected in the press. Over time, there were several unverified confessions to the murder. The murder was never solved. Significance In contrast to the trial of Judith Catchpole in 1636 in which an all-female jury was empaneled to inspect her body and determine if she had been pregnant and given birth, Victorian morality prevented such a direct approach. Without proper medical evidence of her condition, there was not a way to prove during the trial that she was not pregnant. Gravesite Emma's story was featured a season 1 episode of Monumental Mysteries. According to the series, Cunningham is buried at Green- Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Her gray-granite tombstone reads, Emma Augusta Hempstead Cunningham 1818-1887 ‚Äì \\"May God Rest Her Troubled Soul\\" and depicts a beautiful tree etched into the stone. And in a twist of fate, Burdell's grave is only a hundred yards away from hers. Burdell‚Äôs gray-granite tombstone is etched with a weeping willow reads, Harvey Burdell 1811-1857 ‚Äì \\"We humbly beseech thee, O father, to raise us from the life of righteousness; that when we shall depart this life we may rest in him.\\"http://www.murderbygaslight.com/2011/03/bond-street-tragedy.html Footnotes External links *Emma Cunningham Trial: 1857 *Benjamin Feldman '76 Writes Book on NY Murder Mystery *150 Year Old Murder Victim And His Suspect Properly Laid to Rest at Green-Wood * 1816 births 1887 deaths 1857 murders in the United States 1857 in United States case law People from Manhattan New York (state) state case law ","title":"Emma Cunningham"},{"id":"14349486","text":"Deccan Development Society is an Indian agri-based NGO in Medak district in the state of Telangana, India.

It was introduced in 2002‚Äì03 and changed the entire system of higher education in Norway to comply with the Bologna process. This process is intended to take place throughout Europe to better integrate the higher educations systems, and Norway is among the first to implement this process. The Norwegian approach was a quick and brutal removal of the old system and replacement to the new instantly. The main changes included a switch from the old system of Latin degrees to the international Bachelor, Master and Philosophiae Doctor degrees. This replaced the former system of three and a half or four year cand.mag. degrees followed by one and a half or two year hovedfag degrees. The system abolished many old master-level degree titles, including cand.scient. (sciences), cand.polit. (social sciences), cand.philol. (humanities), cand.oecon. (economics), cand.agro. (agronomy), cand.jur. (law), cand.theol. (theology), sivilingeni√∏r (engineering) and sivil√∏konom (management). The length varied, and depended on the area of study, ranging from four to six years. The cand.psychol. (clinical psychology), cand.med. (medicine) and cand.med.vet. titles have been retained as six-year studies in clinical psychology, medicine and veterinary medicine. All master-level titles are now awarded as Master of Science, Master of Technology or Master of Philosophy, all taking five years. Other changed included replacing the former number scale (from 1.0 to 4.0) grades to A to F letter scale, reducing the number of passing grades from 41 to five. It also changed the former system credits of vekttall (with nominal 10 vekttall per semester) to the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) with nominal 30 credits per semester. The reform set new requirements to the follow-up on students, forcing universities and colleges to spend more resources per credit, specially on demands related to assignments.

Ferry donated the land immediately north of Regents Field to the university. In June 1902, Regents Field was renamed Ferry Field. When it opened, Ferry Field had a single wooden bleacher section that seated 400 people. The bleachers burned down in 1895 and were replaced the following year with a new covered grandstand seating 800. Because of the demand for tickets, additional open bleachers seating about 6,000 were built adjoining the covered grandstand. The Athletic Association also had \\"one thousand circus seats and materials for sloping platforms which will permit 8,000 more people to view a football game.\\" Bleachers were later constructed along the south side of the field and the end zones, bringing capacity to over 15,000. The largest crowd ever at Ferry Field was for the second to last game at the old stadium. By one account, 17,000 fans watched the Wolverines defeat Wisconsin in the 1905 homecoming game. In the 1890s a three dollar membership in the Athletic Association gained students admission to all athletic events. By 1904 a general admission ticket cost $3.00. Michigan compiled an overall record of 87‚Äì2‚Äì3 at Ferry Field from 1893 to 1905. Between 1901 and 1904, Fielding H. Yost's \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams went 44‚Äì0 at Ferry Field, outscoring their opponents 2,821‚Äì42. In 1904, the Wolverines beat the undefeated University of Chicago team (coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg) at Ferry Field.

He is portrayed by Agust√≠n Sierra. He serves as a witness with the letter sent by the journalist N√©stor Montero as evidence to Mayor Bustamante's plot against the land of the community people. In later episodes of season one he becomes close to Marizza, Luj√°n, and Luna because they took care of him while they hide his existence from the school. =Javier Alanis= Javier Alanis is the son of Sergio's girlfriend, Pablo's step brother, and is portrayed by Mariano Bertolini. He is in love with Marizza and stops at noting to become her boyfriend; because of this he and Pablo become enemies. Javier frequently interferes in Pablo and Marizza's relationship. He is an antagonist in season 2.  Adults  =Sonia Rey= Sonia Rey is Marizza's mother and one of the most popular celebs in Argentina. She is portrayed by Catherine Fulop. She is very beautiful,charismatic, and easily gets attention, which makes her daughter Marizza somewhat jealous because her mother gets more attention than her.

Bustamante is the antagonist of the story. He does not like Marizza for dating Pablo because he thinks she is beneath him. He kicks Mora out of Pablo's life when Mora stood up for her son and tells Pablo that she left them. He takes joy in torturing Pablo and embarrasses him in any given chance. He owns exactly 51% of Elite Way School. He always gets what he wants at any cost: for example, he pays a prostitute, Paola, to sleep with Pablo so he could lose his virginity and fall in love with her. The relationship is short-lived after he finds out why she met him. Pablo develops a hatred for his dad and eventually, with the help of Matias (the art teacher), he cuts loose. In the end, Bustamante is arrested for corruption. =Marcel Dunoff= Marcel Dunoff is the long-suffering school principal and father of Pilar, and is portrayed by Arturo Bonin. Although he portrays a model of disciplined and honest person, he can be bribed by someone as powerful as Mayor Bustamante. He is very strict when it comes to Pilar. He used to have a relationship with Marizza's mother Sonia Rey, which is why he allows Marizza to attend Elite Way School. =Mat√≠as Miranda= Mat√≠as Miranda is the new art professor in Elite Way School and is portrayed by Federico D'Elia. He appears in season two after Martin Andrade leaves. He spent many years teaching in Spain. At first, the kids (especially Marizza and Pablo) do not like him because they were used to Andrade and Miranda is very strict. He becomes the students' guardian: he helps Luj√°n face Blas' death, Felicitas with her pregnancy, Laura with her sister Lola and the situation with Lola's two mothers, and help and encourages Pablo to confront his father. In the final episode, he gives a job for the class ‚Äì to prepare for the ceremony for the end of the school year. He is named special education worker and gains acceptance from all the kids. =Martin Andrade= Martin Andrade is the real father of Marizza and is portrayed by Miguel √Ångel Cherutti. Marizza was told that her father is Fabrizio Spirito. In season two, he comes back as Octavio the art professor in Elite Way school and Marizza finds out the truth.

It is the province's only mental health facility. Operated by Health PEI, the Hillsborough Hospital is a 75-bed facility providing 24 hr/day, 7 day/week medical services for individuals who are facing acute or enduring mental illnesses. Mission As the provincial in-patient psychiatric facility, Hillsborough Hospital's mission is to offer specialized acute and long-term treatment and rehabilitation to the people of Prince Edward Island who have enduring mental illness, persons with mental handicaps and psycho-geriatric patients. In addition the hospital provides day services to former patients. Services The major specialized services offered include: * assessment/admission/acute and sub-acute treatment and management * behavioural management * rehabilitation/life skills * domiciliary nursing assessments * psycho-geriatric services. The Hillsborough Hospital kitchen also helps provide the 17,000 meals delivered by Meals on Wheels each year. History The Prince Edward Island Hospital for the Insane was established in December 1879 on the present location of the Hillsborough Hospital. This property was known as Falconwood Farm and comprised of land along the Hillsborough River northeast of Charlottetown. It succeeded a facility for the care of the mentally ill which had been built in 1845 at Brighton Shore and had doubled in service as a Poor House. In 1907 the Provincial Infirmary was built on the west end of the facility and this part of the building became part of the Prince Edward Island Hospital for the Insane when the Provincial Infirmary moved to the original Prince Edward Island Hospital site on Kensington Road in 1933. The name of the facility changed to Falconwood Hospital in 1911 and the building was reconstructed in 1933-34 following a disastrous fire in 1931 which took the lives of 8 patients. In 1957 the facility was renamed Riverside Hospital when a central section of the building was completed and connected by tunnels to east and west wings. The Active Treatment Centre was named Hillsborough General Hospital. In the 1970s the entire facility was renamed Hillsborough Hospital. The Riverside Home for Special Care is located in an adjacent facility. In 1982 the Queen Elizabeth Hospital was opened on an adjacent property.

From 6 August 1917 to 9 July 1918, he served as Germany's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In December 1917 von K√ºhlmann explained the main goals of his diplomacy was to subvert and undermine the political unity of the enemy states: :The disruption of the Entente and the subsequent creation of political combinations agreeable to us constitute the most important war aim of our diplomacy. Russia appeared to be the weakest link in the enemy chain. The task therefore was gradually to loosen it, and, when possible, to remove it. This was the purpose of the subversive activity we caused to be carried out in Russia behind the front--in the first place promotion of separatist tendencies and support of the Bolsheviks. It was not until the Bolsheviks had received from us a steady flow of funds through various channels and under different labels that they were in a position to be able to build up their main organ, Pravda, to conduct energetic propaganda and appreciably to extend the originally narrow basis of their party. The Bolsheviks have now come to power; how long they will retain power cannot be yet foreseen. They need peace in order to strengthen their own position; on the other hand it is entirely in our interest that we should exploit the period while they are in power, which may be a short one, in order to attain firstly an armistice and then, if possible, peace.Z. A. B. Zeman. Germany and the Revolution in Russia, 1915-1918: Documents from the Archives of the German Foreign Ministry (1958) p 193 Biography K√ºhlmann was born in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). From 1908 to 1914, he was councillor of the German embassy in London, and was very active in the study of all phases of contemporary political and social life in Great Britain and even in Ireland from where his reports may have helped persuade Berlin that Britain was unlikely to enter a continental fray. K√ºhlmann may have secretly visited Ireland twice in the months before the outbreak of war, where, on either side of the question of Home Rule, Unionists in the north and Nationalists in the south were arming (with German munitions). In an account that appeared in Manchester's Daily Despatch, K√ºhlmann's dispatches from London were interpreted in Berlin as evidence that Britain was so embarrassed by the Irish Question that in all probability she would be unable to participate in a war-- that her hands were tied. K√ºhlmann had gone so far as to report \\"in all seriousness\\" the \\"solemn declaration\\" of \\"a most loyal Ulsterman\\" that \\"we would rather be ruled by the Kaiser than by the Pope.\\" At the outbreak of War, K√ºhlmann was councillor of the embassy at Constantinople. In October 1914 he founded the News Bureau which became a vehicle for German propaganda in the Ottoman Empire. This included postcards of ruined Belgian churches, which were used to appeal to the Jihadist sentiments held by those who had participated in massacres of Christians in Constantinople in 1896 During the Armenian Genocide, K√ºhlmann was initially reluctant to expose the massacres against the Armenian population. K√ºhlmann, who held sympathetic beliefs toward Turkish nationalism, repeatedly used the term \\"alleged\\" and excused the Turkish government for the massacres. K√ºhlmann, in defense of the Turkish government and the German-Turkish World War alliance, stated that the policies against the Armenians was a matter of \\"internal politics\\". However, K√ºhlmann eventually stated that, \\"The destruction of the Armenians was undertaken on a massive scale. This policy of extermination will for a long time stain the name of Turkey.\\" He was subsequently minister at The Hague, and from September 1916 until August 1917, ambassador at Constantinople. Foreign Secretary Appointed foreign secretary in August 1917, he led the delegation that negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which removed the Russian Empire from World War I. He also negotiated the Peace of Bucharest of 7 May 1918, with Romania. In the treaty negotiations, K√ºhlmann encountered opposition from the higher command of the army, and, in particular, of Erich Ludendorff, who desired fuller territorial guarantees on Germany's eastern frontier, the establishment of a German protectorate over the Baltic States and stronger precautions against the spread of Bolshevism. In July 1918, he delivered in the Reichstag a speech on the general situation, in the course of which he declared that the war could not be ended by arms alone, implying that it would require diplomacy to secure peace. This utterance was misinterpreted in Germany, and the higher command was drawn into the controversy which arose over it, so that K√ºhlmann's position became untenable. He was practically thrown over by the Chancellor, Georg von Hertling, in a speech intended to explain away his statement and, after an interview with Emperor Wilhelm II at the front, he tendered his resignation in July 1918.

Discovered by Tsujimoto and Koyanagi in 1933,Tsujimoto M, Koyanagi H. (1933). New unsaturated acid in the kernel oil of \\"akarittom\\", \\"Parinarium laurinum\\". I. Kogyo Kagaku Zasshi 36 (Suppl): 110‚Äì113. it contains 18 carbon atoms and 4 conjugated double bonds. The repeating single bond-double bond structure of Œ±-parinaric acid distinguishes it structurally and chemically from the usual \\"methylene-interrupted\\" arrangement of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have double-bonds and single bonds separated by a methylene unit (‚àíCH2‚àí). Because of the fluorescent properties conferred by the alternating double bonds, Œ±-parinaric acid is commonly used as a molecular probe in the study of biomembranes. Natural sources Œ±-Parinaric acid occurs naturally in the seeds of the makita tree (Parinari laurina), a tree found in Fiji and other Pacific islands. Makita seeds contain about 46% Œ±-parinaric acid, 34% Œ±-eleostearic acid as major components, with lesser amounts of saturated fatty acids, oleic acid and linoleic acid.Hilditch TP et al. (1964). The Chemical Constitution of Natural Fats, Fourth Edition. pg. 253. Œ±-Parinaric acid is also found in the seed oil of Impatiens balsamina, a member of the family Balsaminaceae. The major fatty acids of Impatiens balsamina are 4.7% palmitic acid, 5.8% stearic acid, 2.8% arachidic acid, 18.3% oleic acid, 9.2% linoleic acid, 30.1% linolenic acid and 29.1% Œ±-parinaric acid. It is also present in the fungus Clavulina cristata,Endo S, Zhiping G, Takagi T. (1991). Lipid components of seven species of Basidiomycotina and three species of Ascomycotina. Journal of the Japan Oil Chemists' Society 40(7): 574-577. and the plant Sebastiana brasiliensis (family Euphorbiaceae).Spitzer V, Tomberg W, Zucolotto M. (1996). Identification of alpha-parinaric acid in the seed oil of Sebastiana brasiliensis Sprengel (Euphorbiaceae). Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society 73(5): 569-573. Synthesis =Biosynthesis= The biochemical mechanism by which Œ±-parinaric acid is formed in the plant Impatiens balsamina was elaborated using techniques of molecular biology. The enzyme responsible for the creation of the conjugated double bonds was identified using expressed sequence tags, and called a \\"conjugase\\". This enzyme is related to the family of fatty acid desaturase enzymes responsible for putting double bonds into fatty acids. =Chemical synthesis= Œ±-Parinaric acid may be synthesized chemically using Œ±-linoleic acid as a starting compound. This synthesis enables the transformation of 1,4,7-octatriene methylene-interrupted cis double bonds of naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids to 1,3,5,7-octatetraenes in high yield. More recently (2008), Lee et al. reported a simple and efficient chemical synthesis using a modular design method called iterative cross-coupling. Uses =Membrane probes= Both the alpha and beta (all trans) isomers of parinaric acid are used as molecular probes of lipid-lipid interactions, by monitoring phase transitions in bilayer lipid membranes. Œ±-Parinaric acid was shown to integrate normally into the phospholipid bilayer of mammalian cells, nervous tissue, with minimal effects on the biophysical properties of the membrane. Molecular interactions with neighboring membrane lipids will affect the fluorescence of Œ±-parinaric acid in predictable ways, and the subsequent subtle changes in energy intensities may be measured spectroscopically. Researchers have put Œ±-parinaric to good use in the study of membrane biophysics. For example, it was used to help establish the existence of a \\"fluidity gradient\\" across the membrane bilayer of some tumor cells ‚Äï the inner monolayer of the membrane is less fluid than the outer monolayer. =Lipid-protein interactions= Œ±-Parinaric acid is also used as a chromophore to study interactions between membrane proteins and lipids. Because of the similarity of Œ±-parinaric acid to normal membrane lipids, it has minimal perturbing influence. By measuring shifts in the absorption spectrum, enhancement of Œ±-parinaric acid fluorescence, induced circular dichroism, and energy transfer between tryptophan amino acids in the protein and the bound chromophore, information may be gleaned about the molecular interactions between protein and lipid. For example, this technique is used to investigate how fatty acids bind to serum albumin (a highly abundant blood protein),Keuper HJK, Klein RA, Spener F. (1985). Spectroscopic investigations on the binding site of bovine hepatic fatty-acid binding protein: evidence for the existence of a single binding site for two fatty-acid molecules. Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 38(1-2): 159-174. lipid transport processes including structural characterization of lipoproteins, and phospholipid-transfer proteins. =Clinical uses= The concentrations of fatty acids in blood serum or plasma can be measured using Œ±-parinaric acid, which will compete for binding sites on serum albumin.Berde CB, Kerner JA, Johnson JD. (1980). Use of the conjugated polyene fatty-acid parinaric-acid in assaying fatty-acids in serum or plasma. Clinical Chemistry 26(8): 1173-1177. =Food chemistry= Œ±-Parinaric acid has been used to study the hydrophobicity and foaming characteristics of food proteins,Townsend A-A, Nakai S. (1983). Relationships between hydrophobicity and foaming characteristics of food proteins. Journal of Food Science 48(2): 588-594.Zhu H, Damodaran S. (1994). Heat-induced conformational changes in whey protein isolate and its relation to foaming properties. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 42(4): 846-855. as well as the foam stability of beer. In this latter research, Œ±-parinaric acid was used in a fluorescent assay to assess the lipid‚Äìbinding potential of the proteins in the beer, as these proteins help protect beer from foam‚Äìreducing medium‚Äì and long‚Äìchain fatty acids. Cytotoxic effects on tumor cells Œ±-Parinaric acid is cytotoxic to human leukemia cells in cell culture at concentrations of 5 ŒºM or less, by sensitizing the tumor cells to lipid peroxidation, the process where free radicals react with electrons from cell membrane lipids, resulting in cell damage. It is similarly cytotoxic to malignant gliomas grown in cell culture. Normal (non-tumorous) astrocytes grown in culture are far less sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of Œ±-parinaric acid. This preferential toxicity towards tumor cells is due to a differential regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and forkhead transcription factors between malignant and normal cells.

Her last husband was the glass and ebony dealer Cornelis de Wael. After his marriage to Fourmenois, Musson started to deal in art and his wife played an important role in this trading business. Musson had contacts with dealers throughout Europe. In Flanders, he was active mainly in Antwerp and Brussels. About 60 painters worked for Musson and Fourmenois including Joos de Momper, David Teniers the Younger, Abraham Willemsens, Victor Wolfvoet II and Willem van Herp. After discovering that works of painters from Mechelen, a city situated between Brussels and Antwerp, were of high quality and relatively inexpensive he started sourcing from this city. As a trained painter, he did not limit himself to trading. He gave detailed instructions to his artists and for instance paid Pieter van Lint to make changes to a human figure in one of his paintings.Abraham Willemsens (active 1627-1672), A peasant family in a yard at Christies In 1657 Matthijs Musson bought the art works from the estate of Frans Snyders, which included great works by Rubens and van Dyck as well as examples by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Joachim Patinir, Jan Brueghel the Younger, Joos van Cleve and Frans Ykens.Frans Snyders (Antwerp 1579-1657), 'A partridge, snipe, sparrow, finch, and other birds with a basket of grapes and langoustines in Wan-li kraak porcelain bowls, a mounted stoneware jug, saltcellar, and glasses on a tabletop at Christie's Many of his correspondences have been published and studies of his business relationships with other dealers across Europe have contributed to an understanding of the 17th-century art trade and its economics.Neil De Marchi, Hans J.

Work Only very few artistic works of Matthijs Musson are known. His style was clearly influenced by his master Rubens in his preference for ornamental opulence, sumptuous still lifes and a dramatic sense of narration. The human figures in his compositions are more stylised and svelte in comparison with the Rubenesque models. A work entitled Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary (Collection of the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria) uses a biblical subject as a pretext to create a sumptuous still life. His rendition of the vase of flowers in the centre of the composition is reminiscent of works by the Flemish artist Jan Philip van Thielen, for whom Musson acted as a dealer.Matthijs Musson, 'Jesus in the House of Martha and Mary' at the BBVA Collection) References Flemish Baroque painters Flemish history painters Flemish art dealers People from Antwerp 1598 births 1678 deaths ","title":"Matthijs Musson"},{"id":"14349752","text":"Bilistiche (Greek: ŒíŒπŒªŒπœÉœÑŒØœáŒ∑Belistiche in Pausanias; Belestiche in Plutarch; Blistichis in Clement (Protrepticus 4.42); Philistaikhus in Eusebius (Chronikon); Bilistiche in pCairZen 2.59289.) or Belistiche was a Hellenistic courtesan of uncertain origin.

The treaty ended the destructive Lithuanian Civil War, launched in 1389 by Vytautas who hoped to gain political power, and concluded the power struggle between the two cousins that erupted in 1380 after Jogaila secretly signed the Treaty of Dovydi≈°kƒós with the Teutonic Knights. The Ostr√≥w Agreement did not stop attacks from the Teutonic Knights and the territorial dispute over Samogitia continued up to 1422. According to the treaty, Vytautas became the ruler of Lithuania (styled Grand Duke), but he also acknowledged Jogaila's (styled Supreme Duke) rights to Lithuania. The details of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relationship were clarified in several later treaties, including the Union of Vilnius and Radom in 1401 and Union of Horod≈Ço in 1413. Background In 1389, Vytautas started a civil war against Skirgaila, Jogaila's unpopular regent in Lithuania. Skirgaila was appointed after Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo in 1385 and was crowned King of Poland in 1386. The Lithuanians were dissatisfied with the growing Polish influence in Lithuania. Vytautas promised Samogitia to the Teutonic Knights in reward for their military assistance. Their joint armies made frequent incursions into Lithuania; the largest attack was launched in the early fall of 1390 when Vilnius was besieged for five weeks. Invaders managed to capture the Crooked Castle and turn much of the suburbs into ruins, but failed to take the city. Both sides realized that a quick victory would be impossible and raids were devastating the same country which they sought to rule. Polish nobles were dissatisfied that Jogaila spent so much attention on Lithuanian matters and that the Union of Krewo did not bring the expected results. In such situation Jogaila decided to seek a compromise with Vytautas. Negotiations and treaty Jogaila sent a secret envoy, Henry of Masovia, Bishop of P≈Çock, to negotiate with Vytautas and convince him to accept Jogaila's compromise. The negotiations were started in the Ritterswerder Castle on an island the Neman River near Kaunas, where Vytautas resided at the time. To avoid arousing the suspicion of the Teutonic Knights, Henry proposed to Vytautas' sister Rymgajla and they soon married. The quick marriage of a Catholic official (though he had not received the Holy Orders of priesthood) and his sudden death within a year were scandalous and sparked many rumors and speculations. Vytautas accepted Jogaila's proposal, but could not act immediately, as the Knights held many Vytautas' relatives as hostages. It took some time for him to receive permission from the Knights to transfer the relatives to relative safety. For example, his wife Anna was freed so that she could travel to Lithuania and spread pro-Lithuanian rumors and convert remaining pagans; many nobles were asked to take part in military campaigns. In July 1392 Vytautas openly turned against the Teutonic Knights. He spread false rumors that the army of Jogaila and Skirgaila was moving towards Hrodna and organized his forces for a campaign against them. However, instead of marching to Hrodna, Vytautas attacked Ritterswerder and two other understaffed Teutonic castles on the Neman River before returning to Vilnius. His brother Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis remained in Prussia as prisoner until the Treaty of Salynas in 1398. Simon Grunau spread a false rumor that Iwan and Georg, two young sons of Vytautas, were poisoned by a knight to revenge their father for the betrayal. No reliable historical sources know about such incident or any sons that Vytautas fathered. During the summer Jogaila met Vytautas in person in the Ostrovo (Polish: Ostr√≥w, Lithuanian: Astravas) mansion near Lida in modern Belarus. Its exact location is not known, but one suggested site is near Dzitva River to the east of the village of Yantsavichy. Jogaila handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace. Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as its Grand Duke (Magnus Dux), while Jogaila adopted the higher title Supreme Prince (Prince Supremus). Thus Vytautas recognized that he was Jogaila's vassal whose lands upon his death would pass to the King of Poland. Skirgaila was removed from the Duchy of Trakai to become Duke of Kiev. The treaty was ratified in separate documents of the Polish and Lithuanian states as well as in separate documents signed by Anna, wife of Vytautas, and Jadwiga, wife of Jogaila. The treaty was enacted in several phases, adjusting the equivocal points stated in the Union of Krewo. The treaty strengthened Lithuania's central government as well. Aftermath Vytautas began his reign as the Grand Duke. It is not entirely known what powers were given to him by Jogaila, but he had considerable independence. He replaced some of Jogaila's brothers and supporters with trusted viceroys appointed from Lithuanian nobles: Skirgaila was removed from Polotsk, ≈†vitrigaila from Vitebsk, Kaributas from Severian Novgorod, Vladimir from Kiev, Fyodor Koriatovych from Podolia, and Fyodor Lubartovich from Volhynia. He also made territorial secession in 1398 without approval from Jogaila. While Skirgaila always signed documents first in the name of Jogaila and only then in his own name, Vytautas used only his own name. Lithuania was drifting away from Poland, but the defeat of Vytautas army in the Battle of the Vorskla River against the Golden Horde in 1399 forced to renew the union and conclude the Union of Vilnius and Radom in 1401. It legalized Vytautas independence in the Grand Duchy giving him all the powers of sovereign ruler. However, after his death all lands and powers were to return to the King of Poland. The two countries turned their joint forces against the Teutonic Knights delivering a crushing defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. The Ostr√≥w Agreement ended the civil war and over decade of power struggle, but not the war with the Teutonic Knights. They sought Samogitia, which was promised to them by Vytautas. In January 1393 Hrodna fell; in 1394 a large army assembled in Prussia. Grand Master Konrad von Jungingen led crusaders to Kaunas and then south along the Neman River to Merkinƒó. One body of the invaders was left to plunder the countryside and secure route of retreat, another marched about sixty miles east of Hrodna, and the main force reached Navahrudak deep inside Lithuania. Later the same year another campaign was organized. The crusaders marched through Kernavƒó and on 29 August 1394 attacked Vilnius. While the siege failed it prompted Vytautas to start negotiations. He was still busy establishing his newly acquired power in the east. The Knights contemplated expedition against the Victual Brothers in Gotland as their piratical activities interfered with trade of the Hanseatic League. A preliminary truce was signed in 1396 and final Treaty of Salynas in 1398. It was only a temporary peace and hostilities would lead to the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and would drag until the Treaty of Melno in 1422.

This property located immediately west of Charlottetown's original \\"500 lots\\" was roughly eight times larger than the thirty-six \\"estates\\" established in the northern part of the Queens Royalty. It was envisioned that the property would be used to provide farmland for the governor and a site for an official residence. Prior to the War of 1812, the Prince Edward Battery established a fortification along the shore of the property facing the main shipping channel into Charlottetown Harbour. This battery was manned by British Army regulars, as well as colonial militia until the mid-19th century. In 1809 an Act of the Legislative Assembly was passed to establish a meridional line for surveyors in the colony. In 1820, three commissioners reported to Governor Charles Douglass Smith their calculations of magnetic declination and placed stone markers to this effect in a field cleared immediately north of the Prince Edward Battery. In 1846 additional markers were placed at right angles to the meridional lines (by another Act of the Legislative Assembly). These survey stones remain in the park to this day. The property known as the Governor's Bank (as in land bank) was nicknamed \\"Fanning's Bank\\" and eventually shortened to simply Fanning Bank. In 1826, a farm house and barns were built and in 1832, a tender was called for constructing Government House to house the colonial administrator which opened in December 1834. Public pressure began to build for access to the property and in 1869, the colonial government of the day stated that of land was \\"quite sufficient for Government House\\" and that the remainder should be procured for the public \\"as a place of retreat from the heat, filth and dust of the city\\". On June 14, 1873, only 16 days before the colony became a province of Canada, Governor William Cleaver Francis Robinson vested responsibility of of the Government House Farm, also known as the Fanning Bank Farm, to the City of Charlottetown \\"to and for the use of all her Majesty's subjects as a park, promenade and pleasure ground. On no condition may it be used for circuses, shows or exhibitions of any kind...\\" Shortly after this proclamation, the name Victoria Park was assigned in honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. British military forces left Canada in 1905 and in that year the property containing the Prince Edward Battery and a field adjacent to Government House were given to the City of Charlottetown to add to Victoria Park. Following its transfer of ownership in 1873, the City of Charlottetown began making improvements to Victoria Park, including planting trees, removing stumps, constructing bath houses, and dredging Dead Man's Pond. In 1896 a roadway was built along the shore in front of Government House from Government Pond to the Prince Edward Battery; this occurred only after a legal struggle between the Lieutenant-Governor of the day and the city. The road, now the eastern part of the Park Roadway, was opened in 1897 for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. In 1903 the western part of the Park Roadway was constructed from the Prince Edward Battery along the shoreline to Brighton Road. The entire Park Roadway was paved with gravel in 1925. Development pressures The park has experienced tremendous development pressures during the 20th century: * In 1934, the northern portion of the adjoining Government House property (along the eastern boundary of the park) was secured for the Prince Edward Island Hospital. * A \\"caretaker's cottage\\" was built in the early part of the 20th century to house a park warden, typically a military veteran. * On September 20, 1947, a baseball field and running track named \\"Memorial Field\\" was dedicated in honour of Prince Edward Island athletes who sacrificed their lives in World War I and World War II. * A service road, named the Park Driveway, was constructed at this time to access the baseball field from Brighton Road, continuing south to the Prince Edward Battery, bisecting the park. * In 1955 an ice cream parlour was constructed and operated as a fundraising enterprise for the non-profit Kiwanis Club. * Tennis courts and a clubhouse were constructed off the Park Driveway west of the Prince Edward Battery. * A public swimming pool was built in the 1950s at the northwest corner of the park. * Two softball fields were built on the east side of the Park Driveway opposite Memorial Field during the 1970s-1980s. * A playground was established in the 1970s near the swimming pool. * A skate park was constructed between Memorial Field and the swimming pool/playground in the early 2000s. * Additional tennis courts were constructed in 2008 in preparation for Prince Edward Island to host the 2009 Canada Games. Memorial Field was upgraded at this time. * The Canada Day fireworks displays and associated public celebrations were held at the park near Fort Edward until being moved to Confederation Landing Park in the mid-1990s. The Canada Day fireworks returned to Victoria Park in 2011. * A for-profit children's winter carnival was held in the park during the early 2000s before moving elsewhere. This was moved after being found to be in violation of the park's founding charter.

TSVs are high-performance interconnect techniques used as an alternative to wire-bond and flip chips to create 3D packages and 3D integrated circuits. Compared to alternatives such as package-on-package, the interconnect and device density is substantially higher, and the length of the connections becomes shorter. Classification Visualizing via-first, via- middle and via-last TSVs Dictated by the manufacturing process, there exist three different types of TSVs: via-first TSVs are fabricated before the individual devices (transistors, capacitors, resistors, etc.) are patterned (front end of line, FEOL), via-middle TSVs are fabricated after the individual devices are patterned but before the metal layers (back-end-of-line, BEOL), and via-last TSVs are fabricated after (or during) the BEOL process. Via- middle TSVs are currently a popular option for advanced 3D ICs as well as for interposer stacks. TSVs through the front end of line (FEOL) have to be carefully accounted for during the EDA and manufacturing phases. That is because TSVs induce thermo-mechanical stress in the FEOL layer, thereby impacting the transistor behaviour. Applications =Image sensors= CMOS image sensors (CIS) were among the first applications to adopt TSV(s) in volume manufacturing. In initial CIS applications, TSVs were formed on the backside of the image sensor wafer to form interconnects, eliminate wire bonds, and allow for reduced form factor and higher-density interconnects. Chip stacking came about only with the advent of backside illuminated (BSI) CIS, and involved reversing the order of the lens, circuitry, and photodiode from traditional front-side illumination so that the light coming through the lens first hits the photodiode and then the circuitry. This was accomplished by flipping the photodiode wafer, thinning the backside, and then bonding it on top of the readout layer using a direct oxide bond, with TSVs as interconnects around the perimeter.F. von Trapp, The Future Of Image Sensors is Chip Stacking http://www.3dincites.com/2014/09/future-image-sensors-chip- stacking =3D packages= A 3D package (System in Package, Chip Stack MCM, etc.) contains two or more chips (integrated circuits) stacked vertically so that they occupy less space and/or have greater connectivity. An alternate type of 3D package can be found in IBM's Silicon Carrier Packaging Technology, where ICs are not stacked but a carrier substrate containing TSVs is used to connect multiple ICs together in a package. In most 3D packages, the stacked chips are wired together along their edges; this edge wiring slightly increases the length and width of the package and usually requires an extra ‚Äúinterposer‚Äù layer between the chips. In some new 3D packages, TSVs replace edge wiring by creating vertical connections through the body of the chips. The resulting package has no added length or width. Because no interposer is required, a TSV 3D package can also be flatter than an edge-wired 3D package. This TSV technique is sometimes also referred to as TSS (Through-Silicon Stacking or Thru-Silicon Stacking). =3D integrated circuits= A 3D integrated circuit (3D IC) is a single integrated circuit built by stacking silicon wafers and/or dies and interconnecting them vertically so that they behave as a single device. By using TSV technology, 3D ICs can pack a great deal of functionality into a small ‚Äúfootprint.‚Äù The different devices in the stack may be heterogeneous, e.g. combining CMOS logic, DRAM and III-V materials into a single IC. In addition, critical electrical paths through the device can be drastically shortened, leading to faster operation. The Wide I/O 3D DRAM memory standard (JEDEC JESD229) includes TSV in the design. History The origins of the TSV concept can be traced back to William Shockley's patent \\"Semiconductive Wafer and Method of Making the Same\\" filed in 1958 and granted in 1962,J.H. Lau, Who Invented the Through Silicon Via (TSV) and When? 3D InCites, 2010 which was further developed by IBM researchers Merlin Smith and Emanuel Stern with their patent \\"Methods of Making Thru-Connections in Semiconductor Wafers\\" filed in 1964 and granted in 1967, the latter describing a method for etching a hole through silicon. TSV was not originally designed for 3D integration, but the first 3D chips based on TSV were invented later in the 1980s. The first three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) stacked chips fabricated with a TSV process were invented in 1980s Japan. Hitachi filed a Japanese patent in 1983, followed by Fujitsu in 1984. In 1986, Fujitsu filed a Japanese patent describing a stacked chip structure using TSV. In 1989, Mitsumasa Koyonagi of Tohoku University pioneered the technique of wafer-to-wafer bonding with TSV, which he used to fabricate a 3D LSI chip in 1989. In 1999, the Association of Super-Advanced Electronics Technologies (ASET) in Japan began funding the development of 3D IC chips using TSV technology, called the \\"R&D; on High Density Electronic System Integration Technology\\" project. The Koyanagi Group at Tohoku University used TSV technology to fabricate a three-layer stacked image sensor chip in 1999, a three-layer memory chip in 2000, a three-layer artificial retina chip in 2001, a three-layer microprocessor in 2002, and a ten-layer memory chip in 2005. The inter-chip via (ICV) method was developed in 1997 by a FraunhoferSiemens research team including Peter Ramm, D. Bollmann, R. Braun, R. Buchner, U. Cao-Minh, Manfred Engelhardt and Armin Klumpp. It was a variation of the TSV process, and was later called SLID (solid liquid inter- diffusion) technology. The term \\"through-silicon via\\" (TSV) was coined by Tru- Si Technologies researchers Sergey Savastiouk, O. Siniaguine, and E. Korczynski, who proposed a TSV method for a 3D wafer-level packaging (WLP) solution in 2000. Savastiouk later became the co-founder and CEO of ALLVIA Inc. From the beginning, his vision of the business plan was to create a through silicon interconnect since these would offer significant performance improvements over wire bonds. Savastiouk published two articles on the topic in Solid State Technology, first in January 2000 and again in 2010. The first article ‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs Law ‚Äì The Z Dimension‚Äù was published in Solid State Technology magazine in January 2000.AUTHOR(S)Savastiouk, Sergey, Moore's Law in the Z-Direction, Solid State Technology; Jan 2000, Vol. 43 Issue 1, p84 http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/2668333/moores-law-z-dimension This article outlined the roadmap of the TSV development as a transition from 2D chip stacking to wafer level stacking in the future. In one of the sections titled Through Silicon Vias, Dr. Sergey Savastiouk wrote, ‚ÄúInvestment in technologies that provide both wafer-level vertical miniaturization (wafer thinning) and preparation for vertical integration (through silicon vias) makes good sense.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúBy removing the arbitrary 2D conceptual barrier associated with Moore‚Äôs Law, we can open up a new dimension in ease of design, test, and manufacturing of IC packages. When we need it the most ‚Äì for portable computing, memory cards, smart cards, cellular phones, and other uses ‚Äì we can follow Moore‚Äôs Law into the Z dimension.‚Äù This was the first time the term \\"through-silicon via\\" was used in a technical publication. CMOS image sensors utilising TSV were commercialized by companies including Toshiba, Aptina and STMicroelectronics during 20072008, with Toshiba naming their technology \\"Through Chip Via\\" (TCV). 3D-stacked random-access memory (RAM) was commercialized by Elpida Memory, which developed the first 8GB DRAM chip (stacked with four DDR3 SDRAM dies) in September 2009, and released it in June 2011. TSMC announced plans for 3D IC production with TSV technology in January 2010. In 2011, SK Hynix introduced 16GB DDR3 SDRAM (40nm class) using TSV technology, Samsung Electronics introduced 3D-stacked 32GB DDR3 (30nm class) based on TSV in September, and then Samsung and Micron Technology announced TSV-based Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) technology in October. SK Hynix manufactured the first High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chip, based on TSV technology, in 2013.

It followed Operation PBSuccess, which led to the overthrow of Guatemalan President Jacobo √Årbenz in June 1954 and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. PBHistory attempted to use documents left behind by √Årbenz's government and by organizations related to the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour to demonstrate that the Guatemalan government had been under the influence of the Soviet Union, and to use those documents to obtain further intelligence that would be useful to US intelligence agencies. It was an effort to justify the overthrow of the elected Guatemalan government in response to the negative international reactions to PBSuccess. The CIA also hoped to improve its intelligence resources about communist parties in Latin America, a subject on which it had little information. The first phase of the operation began soon after √Årbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954: several agents were dispatched to Guatemala beginning on July 4. These included agents of the CIA and the Office of Intelligence Research (OIR). The first phase involved the collection of 150,000 documents from sources including √Årbenz's personal possessions, trade union offices, and police agencies. The ruling military junta led by Carlos Castillo Armas aided these efforts. Following a presentation made to US President Dwight Eisenhower on July 20, a decision was taken to accelerate the operation, and the number of people working in Guatemala was increased. The new team members posed as unaffiliated with the US government to maintain plausible deniability. The operation helped set up the Guatemalan National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which was covertly funded by the CIA: agents of the committee became involved in PBHistory. The team studied over 500,000 documents in total, and finished processing documents on 28 September 1954. PBHistory documents were used to support the CIA's existing operations Kufire and Kugown, which sought to track Latin American communists and to disseminate information critical of the √Årbenz government. Documents were also shared with the Kersten Committee of the US House of Representatives, which publicized PBHistory within the US. The documents uncovered by the operation proved useful to the Guatemalan intelligence agencies, enabling the creation of a register of suspected communists. Operation PBHistory did not succeed in its chief objective of finding evidence that the Guatemalan communists were being controlled by the Soviet government, and was unable to counter the international narrative that the United States had toppled the government of Jacobo √Årbenz to serve the interests of the United Fruit Company. Background and origins A mural in Guatemala City celebrating the 10-year Guatemalan Revolution and Guatemalan President Jacobo √Årbenz, who was overthrown in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'√©tat The October revolution of 1944 in Guatemala led to the election of Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo as President of Guatemala, who initiated reforms based on liberal capitalism. Ar√©valo was an anti-communist, and cracked down on the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour (Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo, PGT). The US government was nonetheless suspicious that he was under the influence of the Soviet Union. Ar√©valo's defense minister Jacobo √Årbenz was elected president in 1950. Influenced partly by McCarthyism, the US government was predisposed to see communist influence in √Årbenz's government, particularly after the legalization of the PGT. √Årbenz also had personal ties to some PGT members. In 1952 √Årbenz began an agrarian reform program that transferred uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers in return for compensation. In response the US-based United Fruit Company, which had large landholdings in Guatemala, intensively lobbied the US government for √Årbenz's overthrow. US President Dwight Eisenhower authorized a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation to overthrow √Årbenz, code-named Operation PBSuccess in August 1953. Within the CIA, the operation was headed by Frank Wisner, who had worked in the US intelligence services since World War II. While preparations for Operation PBSuccess were underway, the US government issued a series of statements denouncing the Guatemalan government, alleging that it had been infiltrated by communists. On 18 June 1954 Carlos Castillo Armas, a Guatemalan army Colonel in exile since a failed coup in 1949, led an invasion force of 480 men into Guatemala. The invasion was supported by a campaign of psychological warfare, which presented Castillo Armas's victory as a fait accompli to the Guatemalan people. Worried by the possibility of a US invasion, the Guatemalan army refused to fight, and on June 27 √Årbenz resigned. A map showing the position of the Republic of Guatemala in North America The actions of the United States resulted in international outrage. Media outlets across the world accused the US of sponsoring a coup to reverse √Årbenz's agrarian reform in the interests of the United Fruit Company. This criticism was influenced by the coverage put out by media outlets in communist-controlled countries, but was repeated in the media in countries that were US allies, with Britain's Labour Party and the Swedish Social Democratic Party joining in. Latin American opposition to the US reached a new peak: author Daniel James stated that \\"No one could recall so intense and universal a wave of anti-US sentiment in the entire history of Latin America.\\" Although people within the US saw the coup as a triumph for US foreign policy, CIA officials felt that in order for Operation PBSuccess to be termed a success, further action was needed. Thus, the CIA was interested in finding documents that would allow it to portray the administration of √Årbenz as being controlled by Soviet communists, and thus to justify the coup. Due to the quick overthrow of the √Årbenz government, the CIA believed that the government and the PGT leaders would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate √Årbenz's supposed ties to the Soviet Union. According to historian Nick Cullather, Wisner hoped to \\"expose Soviet machinations throughout the hemisphere\\". The CIA also believed that it could better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little information. Although there had been an active communist movement in Latin America since 1919, it had largely been clandestine, and the CIA knew little about the methods that parties like the PGT used. The CIA hoped that PGT records left behind in haste would enable its international Communism Division to reconstruct the party's leadership and organizational structure, and possibly do the same for other communist parties in the region. The CIA also hoped to exploit the aftermath of the coup to bolster its own intelligence resources. Wisner, who was serving as Deputy Director for Plans at the time of the coup, hoped to recruit agents both from among communists who wanted to defect, and from other Guatemalans who might become a part of the new government. In Wisner's words, he wished to identify \\"people who can be controlled and exploited to further US policy\\". Furthermore, the agency hoped to use the findings of the operation to demonstrate the extent of Soviet influence for propaganda purposes, and also to use the information gathered to completely eliminate any communist influence in Guatemala. Document analysis =First phase= On June 30, 1954, three days after the resignation of √Årbenz, Wisner sent a telegram that later became known as the \\"shift of gears cable\\". Two agents from the CIA, and two from the Office of Intelligence Research (OIR), arrived in Guatemala City on July 4. Castillo Armas had arrived in the capital on the previous day to assume the presidency. One of the CIA officers was Lothar Metzl, who was on the counterintelligence staff of the CIA. Metzl was an Austrian, who had studied communist movements since the 1930s, including in Europe. In Wisner's words, the agents were supposed to perform a \\"snatch job on documents while the melon was freshly burst open\\". The initial targets of the operation were the personal possessions and documents of √Årbenz and those of Carlos Enrique D√≠az (who had been chief of the armed forces under √Årbenz, and briefly his successor as president), the offices of trade unions, known front organizations, police agencies, and the headquarters of the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT). The results of the initial searches were disappointing for the CIA; many of the offices had already been plundered both by the Guatemalan army and by other looters. The CIA were particularly interested in finding documents that mentioned the √Årbenz government's purchase of weapons from Czechoslovakia, but they were unsuccessful. They were also unsuccessful in finding any evidence that the Soviet Union had controlled the communist movement in Guatemala. Despite these difficulties, the agents collected 150,000 documents, in addition to a number of government files, which the agency judged to be useful. The CIA received assistance in collecting these from Castillo Armas's junta, and from the Guatemalan army. The haul was described as the \\"greatest catch of documents ever left behind by a Communist Party and its auxiliaries\\". Most of these had nothing but \\"local significance\\". Although no documents were discovered demonstrating Soviet influence, the CIA hoped to use the large number of papers to show that the communists in Guatemala had had a large influence over the government, through institutions like labor unions, peasant organizations, student unions, and youth groups. On July 20, the CIA agents presented the results of their first two weeks of work in Washington. At Wisner's request, Tracy Barnes‚Äîprincipal manager of CIA operations in PBSuccess‚Äîcreated a booklet from these documents to show to US President Dwight Eisenhower. The 23 documents in the booklet included communist literature owned by √Årbenz, such as a Chinese study on agrarian reform and some Marxist volumes, as well as diplomatic records implying communist sympathies, and a biography of Joseph Stalin belonging to √Årbenz's wife Maria Cristina Villanova. After the presentation, Wisner decided that the examination of the seized documents needed to proceed faster, and so expanded the group of agents working in Guatemala. One of the aims of the new team was to help Castillo Armas establish an intelligence agency that would be able to fight communism in Guatemala. Castillo Armas was pressured to create an anti-communist task force, which he did on July 20‚Äîcreating the National Committee of Defense Against Communism (Comit√© de Defensa Nacional contra el Comunismo). The purpose of this group was to create an anti-communist bureaucracy and intelligence service and to organize records and facilitate PBHistory. The Comit√© secretly received funds from the CIA, with the understanding that this fact could prove \\"very embarrassing\\" and that a new source would eventually need to be found. Although the Comit√© was theoretically an intelligence agency, it also had some police powers. It could order the arrest of anybody suspected of being a communist, and had oversight over all army and police authorities. The CIA team was supposed to help it set up by creating a nucleus of information about people associated with the PGT. The Comit√© was not, however, granted the power to arrest or search house of prominent government officials who had served under √Årbenz. This was largely because Castillo Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comit√©. Nevertheless, the Comit√© was able to conduct personal searches of exiles as they left the country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing. =Second phase= On August 4, a new and larger US contingent was deployed to Guatemala. In order to remain covert, this group identified itself to Armas as the \\"Social Research Group\\", composed of businessmen and experts from universities. It consisted of eight CIA officers, three men from the State Department, and one from the US Information Agency. It was led by an officer working under the pseudonym \\"Francis T. Mylkes,\\" and included David Atlee Phillips, who was fluent in Spanish and had been part of the PBSuccess team. The group presented itself as unaffiliated with the US government in order to avoid nationalist backlash and to maintain plausible deniability. The new PBHistory group worked directly with the new Guatemalan Comit√© training its 25 agents and using them to procure documents; the training covered topics including screening, organizing, and classifying confiscated documents, as well as \\"the rudiments of mail control, logging, abstracting, and cryptic reference\\". Eventually, the 25 personnel of the Comit√© joined the CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side entrance to the building in which the operations took place, in order to maintain the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of each one were to remain in Guatemala. Approximately half of the paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT. By September 1954, the PBHistory agents had found only a small number of top secret documents. Some of the documents showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed √Årbenz's overthrow, a member of one of the series of ruling juntas had prevented the Comit√© from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed. The CIA finished processing documents on September 28, 1954. By this point, the agents had parsed through more than 500,000 unique documents. Photostatic copies were taken of 2,095 important documents, 750 photographs of the material were published for the use of the media, and 50,000 documents were microfilmed. Copies of a handful of important documents were distributed to the various agencies that had been a part of PBHistory, as well as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. Document exploitation The agencies that participated in Operation PBHistory had different aims in mind for the products of the operation. The CIA was most interested in using the information gathered against communist movements in Latin America and elsewhere. The State Department wanted to use them to reconstruct the history of the communist party within Guatemala, while the highest priority of the United States Information Agency was to use the documents to release information that could be used to change international opinion. The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSuccess. =Operation Kufire= Cuban revolutionary Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara. The CIA opened a file on him as a consequence of Operation PBHistory and Operation Kufire, while he was still only known as a physician. Operation Kufire was a wide-ranging effort to track communists from various countries across Latin America who had come to Guatemala during the presidency of √Årbenz. The CIA expected that these individuals would return to their home countries, or to other countries that had liberal policies about political asylum, and by tracking them, the CIA hoped to disrupt their activities. During the course of this operation, a CIA analyst asked Philips whether to open a file on a 25-year old physician, who did not at the time appear to be particularly threatening. Philips said yes, thereby opening a file on Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara, which would quickly become one of the thickest files the CIA had on a single individual. Che's name was added to a secret CIA kill list of individuals targeted for assassination. Few other documents resulted in files that were of enduring value to the CIA. =Operation Kugown= Operation Kugown was the name given to the psychological warfare operation that had played an important part in the overthrow of √Årbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the √Årbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about √Årbenz, and to convince Guatemalans‚Äîand the rest of the world‚Äîthat √Årbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation covering it. This would then be released to the press by the Comit√©, so that the local agency could receive some credit. The Comit√© also released a short documentary film, titled Despues Descubrimos La Verdad (\\"Later We Discover the Truth\\"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the √Årbenz government had been controlled by communists. While the press releases had a substantial impact within Guatemala, the CIA was unable to staunch the continued criticism of the US role in the coup, which came from virtually all countries except for West Germany and the US itself. Very few news agencies chose to run the press releases from the Comit√©, even though a number of them were put out. Information was sent to press agencies worldwide describing infiltration by the PGT and links among Communists elsewhere; nonetheless, their impact remained minimal. The lack of attention frustrated the PBHistory agents to the point where they planned to stage a false flag attack on their own headquarters, which would later be described as the work of Guatemala's remaining communists. However, the CIA decided that such an attack would need the cooperation of too many \\"indigenous\\" people, and the plan was scrapped as being too risky. Operation Kugown also released a large quantity of communist propaganda material that had entered Guatemala from countries within the Soviet sphere of influence; these convinced American journalists such as Donald Grant, of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, that there must have been a connection between √Årbenz and the Soviet government. Ultimately, these operations were unsuccessful in convincing Latin America that the 1954 coup was justified. =Kersten committee= Information from the PBHistory documents was disseminated by the officials of both the US and Guatemalan governments. US ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge made use of 21 documents in a speech he made at the United Nations. Information was also funneled to US ambassadors and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the few Republican controlled Congresses in many years. Republicans sought to use an anti-communist push to generate support for themselves and to erode the voting base of the Democratic party. Anti-Communist members of the US Congress, such as Charles J. Kersten and Patrick J. Hillings of the Kersten Committee, enthusiastically involved themselves with PBHistory. By August 1954, Kersten was receiving PBHistory documents from Dulles so he could use them in speeches to Congress about the Soviet Union's influence in Guatemala. In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held hearings purportedly investigating the penetration of communist influence. PBHistory documents were used in this process, and Castillo Armas became the first head of state to testify before a US Congress committee (although he did so through the use of a tape recording of his testimony). Although the hearings did little to unearth information about communist presence in Guatemala, they provided Operation PBHistory with huge publicity within the US. At the same time, the involvement of the Kersten committee and of Kersten and Hillings caused concern for the CIA. Dulles constantly worried that their investigation would damage CIA operations, particularly when Hillings visited Guatemala shortly before PBSuccess was to begin. Congresspeople had not officially been informed of the CIA's role in the coup, and Dulles wished to keep them uninformed. By supplying them with PBHistory documents, Dulles hoped to forestall them from inadvertently exposing the CIA's other projects. Following the hearings, a subcommittee headed by Hillings produced a final report. In addition to stating without evidence that the Guatemalan government had been acting under orders from the Soviet Union, this report falsely claimed that Soviet weapons had been brought covertly to Guatemala by submarine. This unintentionally drew attention to Operation Washtub, a CIA effort to foist incriminating weapons on the Guatemalan government. =Other uses= Once the CIA had stopped using the documents for propaganda purposes, the agents in charge of PBHistory decided that the best use of the documents they had uncovered would be to record the growth of the communist movement in Guatemala. This research was undertaken by the US State Department's Office of Intelligence Research. The OIR produced a 50-page report after five months of work; the State Department considered it the \\"definitive answer\\" to the question of how communism had arisen in Guatemala. The government of Honduras, which had allowed its territory to be used as a \\"staging area\\" for the coup against √Årbenz, also made use of the PBHistory papers to justify its position. It argued that it had been facing interference in its internal matters from communists in Guatemala. Aftermath and analysis Max Holland, analyzing PBHistory in 2004, wrote that although very few highly sensitive communist documents were found, the operation provided the CIA with its first detailed look at the development of a powerful communist movement. It also allowed them to set up a Guatemalan service that would work against the communists, and for these reasons, the CIA judged the operation to be a success. Historian Kate Doyle stated that the documents uncovered by PBHistory allowed the CIA to create a register of suspected communists. The documents were described by participants as an \\"intelligence goldmine\\"; the register that the CIA left with the Guatemalan security forces contained information on thousands of citizens. PBHistory documents were used for years afterward to discredit √Årbenz (living in exile) and to counter Soviet propaganda about American imperialism in Guatemala. When √Årbenz moved to Montevideo in 1957, the CIA used the PBHistory documents to produce a biography of √Årbenz that described him as a Soviet agent, in an attempt to prevent him from moving to Mexico, where opposition to Castillo Armas' regime was coalescing. Nonetheless, √Årbenz remained a symbol of principled resistance to the United States, helped in part by Soviet propaganda to that effect. When some of the PBHistory documents were published, they received little attention in Latin America. Though PBSuccess was viewed positively within the US soon after it occurred, the violence perpetrated by the Guatemalan governments supported by the US in the 1970s and 1980s changed the perception of the coup among the US public. Despite the report produced by the Office of Intelligence Research, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version of the history of the √Årbenz government and the coup was not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the √Årbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US. As a result, the US government decided to allow Ronald Schneider, a historian who was in the process of completing his Ph.D, to access the PBHistory archive. Schneider published Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954 in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the Comit√© was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the Comit√©, nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that he gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received. The operation failed in its main purpose, which was to find evidence that the government of √Årbenz was under Soviet control. A CIA report published on October 1, 1954, stated that \\"'very few' 'Communist damaging' documents had been found\\". The US failed to persuade Latin Americans of its point of view on communism: most people viewed the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution in a positive light, and even Schneider's account, described by Holland as a balanced portrayal, was unable to persuade the public that the Soviet Union was involved in the rise of Guatemalan communism. Political scientist Jeremy Gunn, who was given access to the material collected by the operation, stated that it \\"found no traces of Soviet control and substantial evidence that Guatemalan Communists acted alone, without support or guidance from outside the country\\". Nothing useful was discovered with respect to international communism either. In contrast, the Soviet government's portrayal was of a Guatemalan government that did not threaten the interests of the US, but which was nonetheless overthrown in order to protect the United Fruit Company. Over time, this description of the events became the favored one in Latin America. The Soviet narrative was further strengthened in 1957, when Castillo Armas was overthrown and replaced with a highly reactionary government which further rolled back the reforms of the 1944 revolution; the Eisenhower administration did not react to the coup in any significant way. When Richard Nixon, then US vice-president, visited Latin America in 1958, he encountered severe abuse wherever he went, even from people who were not communists or their sympathizers. PBHistory was also unable to change the strong resentment against the CIA that the Guatemalan coup had created. Writing in 2008 Gunn compared PBHistory to a similarly unsuccessful attempt by the US to justify the invasion of Iraq after it had occurred. Historian Mark Hove has written that \\"Operation PBHistory proved ineffective because of 'a new, smoldering resentment' that had emerged in Latin America over US intervention in Guatemala.\\" References Sources     * Further reading 1954 in Guatemala Central Intelligence Agency operations Historical revisionism Guatemalan Revolution Covert operations ","title":"Operation PBHistory"},{"id":"14350287","text":"1888 Philadelphia Quakers The history of the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball's National League is a long and varied one. The Phillies are based in Philadelphia, and are a member of the National League East division. Since 2004, the team's home has been Citizens Bank Park in the South Philadelphia section of the city. The franchise has won two World Series championships (against Kansas City in 1980, Tampa Bay in 2008), and seven National League pennants. After replacing the Worcesters in 1883, the franchise made its first post-season appearance in 1915, losing to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. The Phillies franchise also has the second- longest streak of consecutive losing seasons in American professional sports, 16 straight from 1933 to 1948; the record stood until 2009, when it was broken by the Pittsburgh Pirates. After another National League pennant in 1950, the Phillies did not return to the post-season until 1976, beginning a period of extended success for the franchise. Compared to the team's early days, the Phillies have recently been more successful than not, with two such periods: the first from 1975 to 1983, when they won five East Division championships as well as the first-half championship in the strike-shortened 1981 season, and the second starting in 2001, with a winning percentage of .534 in those eight seasons, finishing above .500 in all but one, and making the playoffs from 2007 through 2011. In its 127-season history, the franchise has employed 51 managers and 10 general managers (GMs). Dallas Green and Charlie Manuel are the only Phillies managers to win a World Series: Green in 1980, and Manuel in 2008. Manuel is also the only Phillies manager to win two pennants, and on the last day of the 2011 regular season, surpassed Gene Mauch's 644-win record as the winningest manager in franchise history, taking two fewer seasons than Mauch to accomplish that feat. The longest-tenured general manager is Paul Owens, with 11 years of service to the team as the general manager, from 1972 to 1983. Owens also served as the team manager in 1972, and from 1983 to 1984. After this time, he served as a team executive until 2003, and was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame in recognition of his services. The manager with the highest winning percentage over a full season or more was Arthur Irwin, whose .575 winning percentage is fourth on the all-time wins list for Phillies managers. Origins Ed Delahanty, one of the Phillies' standout players in the early era of the franchise. In 1883, sporting goods manufacturer Al Reach (a pioneering professional baseball player) and attorney John Rogers won an expansion National League franchise for Philadelphia, one of what are now known as the \\"Classic Eight\\" of the National League. They were awarded a spot in the league to replace the Worcester Brown Stockings, a franchise that had folded in 1882. The new team was nicknamed the \\"Quakers\\", and immediately compiled a .173 winning percentage, which is still the worst in franchise history. Although many sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from Worcester ended up with the 1883 Quakers. In 1884, Harry Wright, the former manager of baseball's first openly professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was recruited as manager in hopes of reversing the team's fortunes. Also in 1884, the team changed its name to the \\"Philadelphias\\", as it was common for baseball teams in that era to be named after their cities (for instance, the \\"Bostons\\" and \\"New Yorks\\"). However, as \\"Philadelphias\\" was somewhat hard to fit in newspaper headlines, some writers still continued to call them the \\"Quakers\\" while others began shortening the name to \\"Phillies.\\" The nickname \\"Phillies\\" first appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer for April 3, 1883, in the paper's coverage of an exhibition game by the new National League club. At some point in the 1880s, the team accepted the shorter nickname \\"Phillies\\" as an official nickname. \\"Quakers\\" continued to be used interchangeably with \\"Phillies\\" until 1890, when the team officially became known as the \\"Phillies.\\" This name is one of the longest continually used nicknames in professional sports by a team in the same city.http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/history/timeline01.jsp In 1887, they began play at the stadium eventually known as Baker Bowl. Despite a general improvement from their dismal beginnings, they never seriously contended for the title. The standout players of the franchise in the era were Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, and Ed Delahanty, who in 1896 set the major- league record (since tied by several others) with 4 home runs in a single game. Due to growing disagreements about the direction of the team, Reach sold his interest to Rogers in 1899. Early 20th century With the birth of the more lucrative American League in 1901, the Phillies saw many of their better players defect to the upstart, including a number of players who ended up playing for their crosstown rivals, the Athletics, owned by former Phillies minority owner Benjamin Shibe. Starting pitchers Ernie Shore and Grover Cleveland Alexander shake hands during the 1915 World Series. While their former teammates throve (the AL's first five batting champions were former Phillies), the remaining squad fared dismally, finishing 46 games out of first place in 1902‚Äîthe first of three straight years finishing either seventh or eighth. To add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker Bowl in 1903, killing 12 and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits. The Phillies won their first pennant in 1915 thanks to the pitching of Grover Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy Cravath, who set the major-league single-season record for home runs with 24. However, by 1917 Alexander had been traded away when owner William Baker refused to increase his salary. Baker was known for running the Phillies very cheaply; for instance, during much of his tenure there was only one scout in the entire organization. The effect of the Alexander trade was immediate. In 1918, only three years after winning the pennant, the Phillies finished sixth, thirteen games under .500. It was the start of one of the longest streaks of futility in baseball history. From 1918 to 1948, the Phillies had only one winning record (78‚Äì76 in 1932), only finished higher than sixth twice, and were never a serious factor past June. During this stretch, they finished last a total of 17 times and next to last seven times. This saddled the franchise with a reputation for failure that dogged it for many years. For instance, a 1962 cartoon in a baseball magazine depicted a ballplayer arriving at a French Foreign Legion outpost, explaining, \\"I was released by the Phillies!\\" The team's primary stars during the 1920s and 1930s were outfielders Cy Williams, Lefty O'Doul, and Chuck Klein, who captured the vaunted Triple Crown in 1933. Unfortunately, Philadelphia's cozy Baker Bowl proved to be a fertile hitting ground for Phillies opponents as well, and in 1930, the team surrendered 1199 runs, a major-league record still standing today. 1930s‚Äì1940s Baker died in 1930. He left half his estate to his wife and the other half to longtime team secretary Mae Mallen. Five years earlier, Mallen had married leather goods and shoe dealer Gerald Nugent. With the support of Baker's widow, Nugent became team president. Baker's widow died in 1932, leaving Nugent in complete control. Unlike Baker, Nugent badly wanted to build a winning team. However, he didn't have the financial means to do so. He was forced to trade what little talent the team had to make ends meet, and often had to use some creative financial methods to even field a team at all.http://www.sabr.org/cmsFiles/Files/Bill_Veeck_and_the_1943_sale_of_the_Phillies.pdf One problem was Baker Bowl. Once considered one of the finest parks in baseball, it was not well maintained from the 1910s onward. For instance, until 1925 the Phillies used a flock of sheep to trim the grass. Fans were often showered with rust whenever one of Klein's home runs hit girders. The entire right field grandstand collapsed in 1926, forcing the Phillies to move to the A's Shibe Park (five blocks west on Lehigh Avenue from Baker Bowl) for 1927. Shibe Park / Connie Mack Stadium, home of the Phillies from 1938 to 1970 For several years‚Äîparticularly after Nugent took control of the team‚Äîthe Phillies tried to move to Shibe Park on a permanent basis as tenants of the A's. However, Baker Bowl's owner, Charles W. Murphy, refused to let the Phillies out of their lease at first. He finally relented in 1938, and only then because the city threatened to condemn the dilapidated park. Despite the move, attendance rarely topped 3,000 a game. The nadir came in 1941, when the Phillies finished with a ghastly 43‚Äì111 record, setting a franchise record for losses in a season. A year later, they needed an advance from the league just to go to spring training. Nugent realized he didn't have enough money to operate the team in 1943, and put it up for sale. He found a willing buyer in minor-league executive Bill Veeck, who had the intention of stocking it with Negro League stars. Unfortunately for Veeck, when Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, an ardent segregationist, found out about it, he pressured National League president Ford Frick to have the league take over the Phillies. The story was initially challenged by a 1998 article in the Society for American Baseball Research's The National Pastime, arguing that Philadelphia's black press made no mention of a sale to Veeck. However, in 2006, Jules Tygiel published an article in the 2006 edition of Baseball Research Journal which proved Veeck indeed planned to buy the Phillies.Revisiting Bill Veeck and the 1943 Phillies, The National Pastime, 2006 issue, page 109. Retrieved 2012-05-12. He expanded on it in an appendix, entitled \\"Did Bill Veeck Lie About His Plan to Purchase the ‚Äô43 Phillies?,\\" published in Paul Dickson's biography, Bill Veeck: Baseball's Greatest Maverick. Joseph Thomas Moore wrote in his biography of Doby, \\"Bill Veeck planned to buy the Philadelphia Phillies with the as yet unannounced intention of breaking that color line.\\" A week later, the league sold the Phillies to a wealthy lumber broker named William B. Cox. Nugent had begun phasing out \\"Phillies\\" in favor of \\"Phils\\" during the 1942 season, but Cox almost immediately restored \\"Phillies\\" to the team's jerseys. For the first time in decades, the Phillies had an owner who was not only committed to building a winner, but had the financial resources to do so. He immediately poured some of his wealth into the team payroll. He also devoted significant resources to player development, including the farm system, for the first time in the history of the franchise. His efforts had an immediate impact. By July, they had won only four fewer games than they had in the previous season, and ultimately managed to get out of the National League cellar for the first time in five years in 1943. Although they were still a long way from contention, the Phillies' long-suffering fans appreciated what Cox was trying to do; attendance rose for the first time in nearly 30 years. However, Cox was a very hands-on owner. When manager Bucky Harris objected to Cox's interference, Cox fired him. Harris was still simmering the next day, and dropped a bombshell to the Philadelphia press in his hotel room: he had evidence that Cox was placing bets on his own team. Cox initially claimed that the bets were made by his business associates. However, he eventually admitted to placing several small bets, not knowing it was against the rules. This made no difference to Landis, who banned Cox from baseball for life. Author Rich Westcott was quoted by Sports Illustrated as saying Cox knew \\"next to nothing about baseball. Otherwise, why would he have bet on the Phillies?\\" Soon afterward, Cox sold controlling interest in the Phillies to DuPont heir Robert R.M. Carpenter, who turned control over to his son, Bob, Jr. Carpenter's first act was to try to change the team's name (and more importantly, its image as a chronic loser) to the \\"Blue Jays\\" after a citywide vote on a new nickname. In announcing the change, Carpenter said \\"he had always admired the blue jay and its scrappy qualities.\\"\\"Jays Are Blasted For Lifting Johns Hopkins' Nickname\\", UP report in Fresno Bee, March 9, 1944, p21 However, \\"Phillies\\" continued to appear on the team's jerseys, with a blue jay appearing on the sleeves. The student council of Johns Hopkins University, whose varsity teams are also known as the Blue Jays, vehemently protested Carpenter's decision,\\"Blue Jays Already Creating Squawks\\" The Sporting News, March 16, 1944 claiming that the change dishonored their school due to the Phillies' losing history. The nickname was officially dropped on January 10, 1950.\\"Blue Jay Nickname Junked by Phillies\\" United Press Associations, Tuesday, January 10, 1950 1950s =In general= On May 16, 1953, Curt Simmons pitched an almost-perfect game, when he retired 27 consecutive batters, after the Milwaukee Braves' leadoff batter reached base in the first inning on a single.See: Perfect game. A year later, on May 13, 1954, Robin Roberts likewise pitched an almost-perfect game, when he retired 27 consecutive batters, after the Cincinnati Reds' leadoff batter hit a home run in the first inning. =The Whiz Kids and refusal to integrate= Like Cox, Bob Carpenter, Jr. wasn't afraid to spend the money it took to build a contender. He immediately started signing young players and invested even more money in the farm system. The Phillies quickly developed a solid core of young players, known as the \\"Whiz Kids\\", that included future Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts. This coincided with the final collapse of the A's. Philadelphia had been an \\"A's town\\" for most of the first half of the 20th century. Even though the A's had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies for most of the time since the 1930s, the A's continued to trounce the Phillies at the gate. However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions on the A's part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia's long-suffering fans. Things started coming together for the Phillies in 1949, when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81‚Äì73 record. Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in the first division in 31 years. It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter, Sr., who had died in June and left Bob, Jr. in full control of the team. Although the Phillies led the National League standings for most of the 1950 season, a late-season tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung onto a one-game lead when Dick Sisler's dramatic tenth-inning, three-run home run against the Dodgers clinched the Phils' first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and recipients of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies' status as the city's favorite team. In 1954, the Athletics moved to Kansas City, and sold Shibe Park (renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953) to the Phillies. Carpenter didn't want to buy it, believing it would cost the Phillies more in the long run to own the park than it would renting it from the Athletics. For the past 16.5 years, the Phillies had paid the A's ten cents' rent for every person that came through the turnstiles at their games. However, no other facility in the Delaware Valley was suitable even for temporary use, so Carpenter reluctantly bought the park.Warrington, Robert D. Departure Without Dignity: The Athletics Leave Philadelphia. Society for American Baseball Research, 2010. Many thought that the Whiz Kids, with a young core of talented players, would be a force in the league for years to come. However, the team finished with a 73‚Äì81 record in 1951, and except for a 2nd-place tie in 1964, did not finish higher than third place again until 1975. Their lack of success was partly blamed on Carpenter's unwillingness to integrate his team after winning a pennant with an all-white team. The Phillies were the last National League team to sign a black player, a full 10 years after Jackie Robinson made his debut for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Their competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900. In 1947, when Robinson was signed to the Brooklyn Dodgers, Phillies general manager Herb Pennock called Dodgers team president Branch Rickey and told him not to \\"bring that nigger here with the rest of the team.\\" When the Dodgers arrived with Robinson in the lineup, Philadelphia players stood on the top step of the dugout and pointed bats at him while making shooting noises. Earlier in the season, when the Phillies had visited Ebbets Field, the Phillies players, led by their manager, Ben Chapman, directed so much verbal abuse at Robinson that it served to rally the Dodgers around their teammate and defend him against further attacks. \\"Phold\\" of 1964 Between 1953 and 1962, the Phillies finished at least 18 games out of first place every year, hitting a low point in 1961 when they lost 107 games and finished 46 games out of first. During the 1963 season, the Phillies began to climb back to respectability. Throughout the 1964 season, they seemed destined to make it to the World Series, with excellent performances from players such as rookie third baseman Dick Allen (who won the Rookie of the Year award), starters Jim Bunning (obtained from the Detroit Tigers at the start of the season to shore up the pitching staff) and Chris Short, and star right fielder Johnny Callison. On Father's Day, Bunning pitched a perfect game against the New York Mets, the first in Phillies history. TV Guide went to press with a World Series preview that featured a photo of Connie Mack Stadium. However, with a -game lead on the Cincinnati Reds with 12 games remaining in the season, Philadelphia collapsed in a 10-game losing streak (the first seven played at home). The crucial series came when the now second- place Phillies traveled to St. Louis to play the Cardinals after their losing home stand. They dropped the first game of the series to Bob Gibson by a 5‚Äì1 score, their eighth loss in a row, dropping them to third place. The Cardinals would sweep the three-game set and assume first place for good. The Phillies still had a chance to force an unprecedented three-way tie for first after the Cardinals dropped the first two games of their last season series to the New York Mets. However, the Cardinals won their last game of the season, leaving the Phillies tied with the Reds for second place‚Äîjust one game out of first. The \\"Phold of '64\\" is frequently mentioned as the worst collapse in sports history. 1970s By the late 1950s, Carpenter decided that the Phillies needed a new home. As mentioned above, he never wanted to buy Connie Mack Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced there was no way he could make money playing there. The stadium didn't have nearly enough parking; indeed, it had never been well suited to automobile traffic, having been built before the Model T was introduced. The neighborhood around it had already gone to seed. To that end, he sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a million-dollar loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. The Phillies remained at the old stadium until 1970. In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2‚Äì1. The Phillies opened the new Veterans Stadium in 1971, with hopes of a new beginning. In their first season there, pitcher Rick Wise hurled a no-hitter. On September 18, 1971, Wise pitched another near-perfect game, in which he gave up a home run to the Chicago Cubs' leadoff batter in the second inning, but then did not allow another baserunner until the 12th inning, with two outs. He had been perfect for retiring 32 consecutive batters‚Äîthe record for most consecutive outs in a game by a winning pitcher. That same season, Harry Kalas joined the Phillies broadcasting team. In 1972, the Phillies were the worst team in baseball, but newly acquired Steve Carlton won nearly half their games (27 of 59 team wins). In that same year, Bob Carpenter retired and passed the team ownership to his son Ruly. By 1974, the Phillies began their quest for a championship that would be theirs 6 years later. That year second baseman Dave Cash coined the phrase \\"Yes We Can\\" for the Phils. Indeed, for a while, it looked as if they could. They led the division for 51 days; however, in August and September, the Phillies went 25‚Äì32 and it was \\"No They Couldn't\\". The Phillies achieved some success in the mid-1970s. With such players as Carlton, third baseman Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976‚Äì78). However, they fell short in the NLCS, against the Reds in 1976 and the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, the Phillies acquired Pete Rose, the spark that would put them over the top. 1980: First World Series championship The Phils won the NL East in 1980, but to win the league championship, they would have to defeat the Astros. In a memorable NLCS, with 4 of the 5 games needing extra innings, they fell behind 2‚Äì1 but battled back to squeeze past the Houston Astros on a tenth-inning game-winning hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first pennant in 30 years. The entire series saw only one home run hit, a game-winning two-run home run by Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski in the Phillies' opening 3‚Äì1 win in Game 1 at Philadelphia. Facing Kansas City in the 1980 World Series, the Phillies won their first world championship in 6 games, thanks to the timely hitting of Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. Schmidt, who was the NL MVP for the 1980 season, also won the World Series MVP finals award on the strength of his 8 for 21 hitting (.381 average), including game-winning hits in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6. Thus, the Phillies became the last of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues from 1901 to 1960 to win a World Series. By comparison, the other 15 teams had each appeared in at least three World Series and won it at least once. 1981‚Äì1992 During the early 1980s, when baseball was becoming more drug-conscious, several Philadelphia players admitted to having used amphetamines from time to time. A memorable Philadelphia Daily News headline dubbed the team \\"The Pillies\\". The team made the playoffs in the strike-shortened 1981 season losing to Montreal in the special pre-LCS playoff series. After the 1981 season Ruly Carpenter, dissatisfied with changes in baseball's labor environment, sold the team to a group of investors led by team executives Bill Giles and David Montgomery for $32.5 million‚Äîa handsome return on his grandfather's $400,000 investment 38 years earlier. In 1983, the \\"Wheeze Kids\\" won their fourth pennant, but lost the 1983 World Series to Baltimore in 5 games. The 1983 season was the Phillies' centennial year. On September 28, they defeated the Chicago Cubs, 13‚Äì6, at Wrigley Field. This victory gave the Phillies the National League East Division championship. It was also the 7,000th win in team history. The Phillies struggled for most of the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s. Aside from a distant second-place finish in 1986 ( games behind the Mets), they were not a serious factor in a pennant race for the rest of the decade. During this stretch, the 1984 team was the only other one that even managed to get to the .500 mark. During this time, the Phillies often struggled to attract more than 25,000 people to Veterans Stadium, the biggest in the National League at the time (at over 62,000 people). Even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment. One factor in the Phillies' decline was the acquisition of Iv√°n DeJes√∫s from the Cubs in return for Bowa and a young prospect named Ryne Sandberg. Although the trade is now reckoned as one of the most lopsided trades in baseball history, it may have made some sense at the time from the Phillies' perspective. Although Sandberg had clearly earned a spot in the majors (he'd hit .290 in the minors for two years in a row), the Phillies didn't think they had a position for him. He'd seen time in the minors at shortstop, second base, third base and center field‚Äîspots held by Bowa, Manny Trillo, Schmidt and Maddox, respectively. Nonetheless, the Phillies didn't get nearly enough in return. DeJesus only batted .249 in three years with the Phillies, and was out of baseball by 1988. Meanwhile, Sandberg went on to a Hall of Fame career. On August 15, 1990, Terry Mulholland lost a perfect game in the seventh inning when a San Francisco Giants' batter reached base on a throwing error. The next batter grounded into a double play. Thus, Mulholland faced the perfect-game maximum of 27 batters, but did not qualify for a perfect game. He was credited, however, with a no-hitter.See: Perfect game. The 1992 season would end with the Phillies at the bottom of the barrel, at last place in the National League East. However, their fortunes were about to change. 1993: Fifth National League championship: Worst to First Curt Schilling, pictured here with Boston, was an instrumental cog in the Phillies' 1993 National League pennant win. The 1993 Phillies were led by stars such as Darren Daulton, John Kruk, Lenny Dykstra, and Curt Schilling. The team was often described as \\"shaggy\\", \\"unkempt\\", and \\"dirty.\\" This team was known as a bunch of throw back, whatever it takes kind of players. The previous year, noting the presence of the clean-cut Dale Murphy, Kruk himself described the team as \\"24 morons and one Mormon\\" or a bunch of idiots and Murph. Their character endeared them to fans, and attendance reached a record high the following season. As a play on the legendary 1927 New York Yankees' Murderers' Row, the team's dirty, mullet-wearing look was dubbed \\"Macho Row.\\" To the surprise of their city and the nation, the Phillies powered their way to a 97‚Äì65 record and an East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the Fightin's went 17‚Äì5. Each game brought a new hero, and the season was filled with odd and extraordinary games. The 1993 Phillies team was also noted for the close bond between the players and coaching staff. A ticket for a 1993 game between the Phillies and the Chicago Cubs. The Phillies' major contributors on offense were OF Lenny Dykstra, 1B John Kruk, SS Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and OF Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch \\"Wild Thing\\" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA. The Phillies beat the Atlanta Braves (the two-time defending National League champions) in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth pennant in franchise history. They faced the defending world champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. Philadelphia lost the Series in six games, with Toronto's Joe Carter hitting a walk-off three-run home run off of Mitch Williams in Game 6, to win a second consecutive championship for the Blue Jays. Following that loss, Williams was the subject of death threats and other hostile reaction from some irate Phillies' fans; he left for the Astros. 1994‚Äì2005 With the 1994 players' strike, most of the Phillies' fan base was greatly offended, and afterward, the team had little success either on the field or at the gate for a decade. Both were negatively affected by the realignment of the Atlanta Braves into the National League East in 1994, as the Braves won the division every year until 2006, often by wide margins. In addition, the nucleus of the 2008 World Series-winning club (Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, Jimmy Rollins, Brett Myers, and Cole Hamels) was developed during this era. Former Phillie Larry Bowa was hired as manager for the 2001 season, and led the Phillies to an 86‚Äì76 record, their first winning season since the 1993 World Series year. They spent most of the first half of the season in first place, and traded first place with the Braves for most of the second half. In the end, they finished two games out of first, the Braves' tightest division race in years. Bowa was named National League Manager of the Year. The Phillies continued to contend for the next few years under Bowa, with the only blemish being an 80‚Äì81 season in 2002. This marker in the Citizens Bank Park parking lot commemorates Veterans Stadium, the Phillies' home for many years. The following year, in their last season at Veterans Stadium, the Phillies were expected to contend for the World Series after adding such players as Jim Thome, Kevin Millwood, and David Bell to go along with the emerging nucleus of Rollins, Burrell, Wolf, and Vicente Padilla. However, Burrell and Bell slumped miserably at the plate, and the Phillies' inconsistent bullpen led to the team finishing 86‚Äì76 and in third place behind the Braves and eventual World Series-winning Florida Marlins. The opening of the new Citizens Bank Park brought fans new hope, and the team was expected to win the NL East. However, they finished a distant second, and Bowa was fired with two games to go in the season. Charlie Manuel took over as manager for 2005, and kept the Phillies in contention throughout the season; they were only eliminated from wild card contention on the next- to-last day. However, it was not enough to save the job of general manager Ed Wade; he was fired after his eighth season. Soon after, the Phillies hired Pat Gillick, who, ironically, was the general manager of the 1992 and 1993 Toronto Blue Jays' Championship teams. Despite another late-season disappointment, 2005 saw the Phillies core shift away from veterans such as Thome, Polanco, Abreu, and Wolf to younger home-grown stars such as Rollins, Utley, Brett Myers and Ryan Howard. 2006 Continuing what he had begun in the off- season, Gillick engaged in a flurry of trades in an effort to transform the character of the team and to obtain financial flexibility for what he termed \\"retooling.\\" On July 26, 2006, the Phillies traded backup catcher Sal Fasano to the New York Yankees for minor league infielder Hector Made. Two days later, the Phillies traded third baseman David Bell, who was due to become a free agent during the off-season, to the Milwaukee Brewers for minor league pitcher Wilfredo Laureano. Gillick did not stop there, making a deadline deal that sent outfielder Bobby Abreu and pitcher Cory Lidle to the Yankees in exchange for Matt Smith, C.J. Henry, Carlos Monastrios, and Jesus Sanchez. The Liberty Bell replica at Citizens Bank Park rings for every Phillies home run and victory.The team responded well to the changes. All-Star second baseman Chase Utley was free to bat third, and Ryan Howard batted cleanup; more importantly, they assumed a team leadership role along with shortstop Jimmy Rollins. On August 18, Gillick acquired veteran left-hander Jamie Moyer, a native of the Philadelphia suburb of Souderton, Pennsylvania, for the starting rotation. Immediately afterwards, and following a win over the Washington Nationals on August 29, the Phillies' record stood at 66‚Äì65, trailing the San Diego Padres by a mere half game in the wild-card race. By September 24, the Phillies had captured and lost the wild-card lead and were tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers. With identical 82‚Äì74 records, both teams took to the road for the final six games, the Phillies to Washington and Florida, the Dodgers to Colorado and San Francisco. On September 30, both the Dodgers and Padres won their respective games and as a result, the Phillies were eliminated from playoff contention while two games behind with only one left to play. Ryan Howard was named the National League's Most Valuable Player, narrowly edging the St. Louis Cardinals' Albert Pujols to claim the top honor in the National League. 2007‚Äì2011: NL East Dominance =2007: 10,000 losses and an incredible regular-season finish= The special assistant to the general manager and long-time Phils coach, John Vukovich, died of brain cancer on March 8, 2007, and was honored on August 10, 2007 by the Phillies organization, which installed a plaque bearing Vukovich's name and accomplishments on the \\"Wall of Fame\\" in the Ashburn Alley outfield concourse at Citizens Bank Park. For the 2007 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch on their right uniform sleeves bearing the letters \\"VUK\\" in white. The Phillies began the 2007 season with a 5‚Äì3 home loss on April 2 to the Atlanta Braves after 10 innings. After the first 15 games, the Phillies limped to a 4‚Äì11 record, but then found a five-game winning streak to put them back into contention in the National League East. After 40 games, the Phillies finally reached the .500 mark at 20‚Äì20. Heading into the All-Star break, the Phillies split their win/loss record at 44‚Äì44, hampered by the loss of starting pitchers Freddy Garc√≠a and Jon Lieber due to injuries that sidelined them for the remainder of the season. They found a bright spot in young pitcher Kyle Kendrick, who rose from the Phillies' AA team in Reading, Pennsylvania to the Phils starting rotation in 2007. Three Phillies were named to the 2007 All Star Game in San Francisco. Chase Utley was the starting second baseman for the National League squad and center fielder Aaron Rowand was named as a backup (his first All Star appearance). Starting pitcher Cole Hamels also appeared in his first All Star Game. 2007 MVP Jimmy Rollins recorded the fourth 20‚Äì20‚Äì20‚Äì20 season in MLB history. On July 15, 2007, the Phillies lost their 10,000th game, 10‚Äì2 to the St. Louis Cardinals on a nationally televised ESPN game.The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Game Wrapup The Phillies became the first North American professional sports franchise to lose 10,000 games. On September 21, Jimmy Rollins became the first player in major league history to collect 200 hits, 15 triples, 25 home runs, and 25 stolen bases in the same season. Rollins also became the 4th player to have at least 20 home runs, 20 triples, 20 doubles, and 20 stolen bases in a season on September 30, securing the feat on the last day of the season with a sixth inning RBI triple. On September 12, the Phillies were seven games behind the New York Mets in the National League East, and it appeared as if their division hopes were dashed. However, the Mets suffered an epic collapse on the likes of the \\"Phold of 1964\\", going 4‚Äì11 over the next 15 games while the Phillies parried with a strong 12‚Äì3 record. The Phillies had defeated the Mets in eight consecutive encounters (between July 1, 2007 and September 16, 2007) and ultimately overtook the Mets by one game on September 28. The Phillies fell back into a first-place tie the following day with a Mets win and a Phillies loss, with only one game remaining in the regular season to decide the champion of the National League Eastern Division. The Mets would lose their final game of the season. Only minutes later, the Phillies defeated the Washington Nationals, clinching the division for the Phillies for the first time in 14 years. The Phillies won the final game behind 44-year-old Jamie Moyer, who in 1980 had skipped a day of high school to attend that year's Phillies championship parade down Philadelphia's Broad Street. After their historic comeback, they were swept in three games by the Colorado Rockies after losing 2‚Äì1 in Game 3 on October 6, 2007. It was the first time since 1976 that the Phils were swept in a postseason series. On November 20, 2007, Jimmy Rollins was named National League MVP, edging out Colorado Rockies left fielder Matt Holliday by 17 votes, making it one of the closest contests since the voting format was adopted in 1938. Along with Ryan Howard's 2006 win, they became the first baseball club with back-to-back MVP winners since the San Francisco Giants's Jeff Kent and Barry Bonds in 2000 and 2001, respectively. 2007‚Äì08 offseason: Philly favorites Even though their sweep from the playoffs was a disappointment, the Phillies started on their quest for October baseball in 2008 by trading OF Michael Bourn, RHP Geoff Geary, and 3B Michael Costanzo (since traded to the Baltimore Orioles) to the Houston Astros for RHP Brad Lidge and IF Eric Bruntlett. They also re-signed LHP J. C. Romero to a three-year deal, in addition to bringing back manager Charlie Manuel and the rest of the coaching staff. The Phillies signed OF Geoff Jenkins to a two-year deal, to be the left-handed part of a platoon with right-handed OF Jayson Werth. They also signed OF So Taguchi to a one-year deal, as a pinch hitter/backup outfielder. With these new outfielders coming into town, the Phillies sold OF Chris Roberson to the Baltimore Orioles. Most recently, the Phillies acquired free-agent 3B Pedro Feliz, formerly of the San Francisco Giants, inking him to a two-year contract worth $8.5 million.The Official Site of The Philadelphia Phillies: News: Phillies solidify hot corner with Feliz These additions relegated IF/OF Greg Dobbs to a utility role, where he excelled in the previous season as the team's primary left-handed pinch hitter. On February 21, 2008 an arbitrator ruled in Ryan Howard's favor, giving him a $10 million salary for the 2008 season. Major League Baseball's website also named the Phillies as the favorites for the National League East championship for 2008.The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Phillies, Mets, Braves to go back at it Meanwhile, in the wake of the 2007 season and Carlos Beltr√°n's calling out of the 2008 Phillies' team, the Mets‚ÄìPhillies rivalry now stood as one of the most intense in baseball. =2008: A second World Series championship= Chase Utley's hot bat powered the Phillies to their first winning April in five years. Though the Phillies were named in some sources as the favorites to repeat as division champions, they did not get off to the blazing April start that many had hoped for. Still, they managed their first winning opening month since 2003, and only their fourth since their last World Series appearance. With a batting average of .360 and his MLB-leading 11 home runs, Chase Utley paced the team's offense, followed closely by a resurgent Pat Burrell and his 25 runs batted in. Though team speed was hampered by the loss of Shane Victorino and Jimmy Rollins to the disabled list, the latter for the first time in his career, the Phillies still pushed forward to a 15‚Äì13 record. The pitching rotation was led by ace Cole Hamels, who led the team in wins (3), ERA (2.70), and innings pitched (). Reliever J. C. Romero and new closer Brad Lidge both went the entire month without sacrificing a single run, over and 11 innings respectively. Jayson Werth emerged as a valuable asset to the team in the month of May. Expected to be primarily a platoon player coming into the season, Werth showed flashes of the form that once made him such a highly regarded prospect with the Dodgers. While Utley's bat cooled, Werth had a game with three home runs and stole four bases in the month. Unfortunately, as Rollins and Victorino returned, Werth was lost to the disabled list. Ryan Howard broke out of his early-season slump, hitting .245 in May, nearly an 80-point increase from his average in April, and slugging ten home runs. Hometown pitcher Jamie Moyer also became the sixth pitcher in Major League Baseball history to defeat all 30 teams in the league on May 26, in a 20‚Äì5 Phillies win over Colorado.The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News Kyle Kendrick posted a 3‚Äì1 record in June 2008. June was a tale of two halves for the Phillies, as they ended May and started June with a strong run of offense and excellent pitching. From May 26 to June 13, the Phillies posted a 14‚Äì4 record, starting their run with a 15‚Äì6 win over the Astros and ending with a 20‚Äì2 win over the Cardinals. However, the offense took a downturn as the Phillies pitchers began to sacrifice more runs in the latter part of the month. The Phillies went 3‚Äì11 over the remainder of June, with the pitchers allowing an average of 4.79 runs per game, to the offense's 3.36 runs scored per game. This was punctuated by a season-high 6-game losing streak. The poor records coincided with the Phillies' stretch of interleague play for 2008, as they were swept by the Angels, and lost their series with the Red Sox, A's, and Rangers, in addition to dropping two NL series against the Cardinals and Marlins. While Hamels and Kyle Kendrick each managed to post a 3‚Äì1 record in the rotation, the other starters (Moyer, Adam Eaton, and Brett Myers) were not so lucky. Myers' poor performance received arguably the most scrutiny, based on management's decision to move him back to the rotation from the bullpen after the 2007 season. Myers would eventually accept a demotion to AAA Lehigh Valley to work on his confidence and mechanics. July began with the announcement that Chase Utley and Brad Lidge would represent the team at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, with Utley garnering the most votes of all National League players. The Phillies went 8‚Äì4 in July before the All- Star break, compiling a four-game win streak, a four-game losing streak, and winning four of their last five. In a move to bolster their starting rotation in preparation for the pennant race, the Phillies traded three minor league players, including second baseman Adrian Cardenas, pitcher Josh Outman, and outfielder Matthew Spencer to the Athletics for starting pitcher Joe Blanton on July 17. On September 27, the Phillies clinched the National League East for the second year in a row, once again helped by a late September slump from the New York Mets. The Phillies redeemed their previous year's playoff performance by winning the NLDS three games to one against the Brewers, and they defeated the Dodgers in Los Angeles as well, 4‚Äì1. As the National League champions, the Phillies advanced to the 2008 World Series to play the Tampa Bay Rays. After a power outage by the offense in which they went 1 for 33 with runners in scoring position and the first-ever suspended postseason game in World Series history in game five, the Phillies rode their pitching rotation to a 4‚Äì1 victory in the Fall Classic; Hamels was named the series MVP for both the NLCS and the World Series. =2009: Two straight Series appearances= The Phillies posted a second consecutive winning April to open the season with an 11‚Äì9 record, but the month was marred by the death of legendary broadcaster Harry Kalas. After opening the month of May against the rival New York Mets, the Phillies met President Barack Obama to celebrate their World Series victory the previous season, and had two rookie pitchers win consecutive starts for the first time since 2007. Starting pitcher Jamie Moyer earned his 250th career win during the month, while first baseman Ryan Howard and outfielder Ra√∫l Iba√±ez became the first Phillies teammates to hit 10 home runs in the same month. Echoing their strong run in the middle of the 2008 season, the Phillies compiled a 16‚Äì4 record in late May and early June, which was countered by weakness during interleague play in late June. After the team's largest victory of the season (22‚Äì1 over the Cincinnati Reds) in early July, five Phillies‚ÄîHoward, Ib√°√±ez, second baseman Chase Utley, and outfielders Shane Victorino and Jayson Werth‚Äîwere selected to the All-Star team. July was the team's best showing of the season, as they compiled their first 20-win month since the 2001 season. The Phillies traded for starting pitcher Cliff Lee at the end of the month to bolster their starting rotation, who won his first five starts with the team, and signed free-agent pitcher Pedro Mart√≠nez. In August, Eric Bruntlett turned the first game-ending unassisted triple play in National League history, and only the second unassisted triple play in team history. The following month, the team clinched its third consecutive division championship on September 30, becoming the first Phillies team to make a third straight playoff appearance since the 1976‚Äì1978 Phillies. Philadelphia defeated the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series (NLDS), 3‚Äì1, and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) for the second consecutive year, 4‚Äì1. Howard was named the most valuable player of the NLCS. The Phillies were defeated by the Yankees in the World Series, four games to two. On December 7, 2009, Baseball America named the Phillies as its Organization of the Year. On December 9, Chase Utley was named by Sports Illustrated as the second baseman on its MLB All-Decade Team. On December 22, Sports Illustrated named retired general manager Pat Gillick as number 7 on its list of the Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade (in all sports).The list's only other MLB GMs were Boston's Theo Epstein (No. 3) and Oakland's Billy Beane (No. 10). =2010: Fourth consecutive NL East title= After the 2010 season, Jayson Werth left the Phillies to pursue a more- lucrative contract with the Washington Nationals. One of the highlights of the season occurred on May 29, when Roy Halladay pitched a perfect game, the second in franchise history. The Phillies finished with a 97‚Äì65 record, the best record in major league baseball. In the NLDS, they swept the Cincinnati Reds, 3‚Äì0. In Game 1, Halladay's first career postseason start, he hurled a no-hitter, giving up only one walk. It was only the second postseason no- hitter in Major League Baseball history, and the first since Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series. The Phillies lost the 2010 National League Championship Series, 4 games to 2, at the hands of the San Francisco Giants, who went on to win their first World Series title since 1954, defeating the Texas Rangers. Halladay was named the National League's Cy Young Award winner. =2011: Fifth consecutive NL East title= In 2011, the Phillies amassed a starting pitching rotation that ESPN referred to as the \\"best rotation in major league history.\\" This rotation included Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt, Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels and Joe Blanton. Blanton was sidelined with injury and was replaced with Vance Worley, a AAA pitcher from the Lehigh Valley IronPigs who amassed an 11‚Äì3 record in the 2011 season. The Phillies won 14 consecutive games when Worley started, including games where he did not receive the decision. On August 16, after a two-day delay because of inclement weather, the Phillies, led by Steve Carlton and Jimmy Rollins, and hosted by Phillies public address announcer Dan Baker, unveiled a tall bronze statue of Hall of Fame announcer Harry Kalas in the left field side of the Ashburn Alley outfield concourse at Citizens Bank Park, between the Harry the K's restaurant and the center field statue of Kalas' best friend, Richie Ashburn. Privately commissioned and funded entirely by donations by fans, this statue shows Kalas standing cross-legged on top of a home plate, with a microphone in his right hand, which is also on top of a baseball bat, which Kalas is leaning upon. A bronze plaque embedded in the concrete walkway at the foot of the statue carries the originally planned August 14 unveiling date. The Phillies amassed a 102‚Äì60 record, the best in franchise history, and the best regular-season record in MLB in 2011. The previous record of 101‚Äì61 was set in both 1976 and 1977. Immediately after the Phillies clinched their division championship in mid-September, while playing several bench players and shuffling their batting order, they suffered an 8-game losing streak, becoming the first team in MLB history to lose 8 straight after winning their division and winning 98 games in a season. The Phillies eliminated the Atlanta Braves from wild card contention on the last day of the regular season, sweeping a 3-game series against the Braves in Atlanta, erasing an game lead that the Braves held in the wild card lead as of September 1, 2011. The St. Louis Cardinals caught and surpassed the Braves on the last game of the season, and faced the Phillies in the 2011 National League Division Series, which was tied at 2 games apiece as of October 6, 2011. The Phillies lost the deciding Game 5 at Citizens Bank Park the next night. The Cardinals went on to win their 11th World Series title (most in the National League), defeating the Texas Rangers. 2012‚Äì2017: Collapse and Rebuilding =2012: End of streak= In the 2011‚Äì2012 off- season, the Phillies re-signed Jim Thome and signed closer Jonathan Papelbon and Laynce Nix, as well as obtaining Ty Wigginton via a trade with the Colorado Rockies. During the season, the Phillies put up a sub-par performance during the early and middle months of the season, and fell into last place for much of the season. The Phillies traded away Shane Victorino, Joe Blanton and Hunter Pence during August, as team management did not see the possibility of reaching the post-season. In August, not long after the trades, the Phillies caught fire, and finished with an 81‚Äì81 record, after being 14 games below .500 at mid-season. The Phillies finished in 3rd place in the NL East, 17 games behind the Washington Nationals and 13 games behind the Atlanta Braves, who went on to win one of the wild card spots. The Phillies finished 7 games out of contention for the wild card. =2013: Struggles continue= During the offseason the Phillies didn't make a lot of moves in the off-season in hopes of returning to form. The major one was when they acquired Ben Revere from the Twins in exchange for Vance Worley and Trevor May. They struggled throughout the season and never managed a winning record in any months of the season. On August 16, 2013 the Phillies fired Charlie Manuel after posting a 53‚Äì67 record. He was replaced by third base coach Ryne Sandberg for the rest of the season as the Phillies ended the season 73-89 and missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. Many fans criticized the firing of Manuel as they felt the general manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. was to blame for not getting enough free agents to help the team on the downturn. =2014: Stagnation= After the 2013 season, Roy Halladay retired from baseball and many transactions were made to the Phillies roster. Despite the changes made to the roster, the team still struggled to find any consistency especially on offense. The Phillies wouldn't have a winning record in any month on the season until August where they posted a 14‚Äì13 record. The Phillies ended the season 73‚Äì89, the same record as the previous year. =2015: Bottom of the league= Low expectations were set for the Phillies as they were predicted to be the worst in the MLB due to their aging core. Many of the veteran players on the Phillies were traded away like Jimmy Rollins, Chase Utley, and Cole Hamels. Cliff Lee would be injured during the season and would become a free agent in 2016. Ruben Amaro, Jr. was fired near the end of the season and Ryne Sandberg would resign during the middle of the season. Pete Mackanin would take over as the interim head coach of the Phillies. They ended the season with a 63‚Äì99 record, the worst in the MLB. =2016: Glimmers of hope= The Phillies got off to a surprising start during the first quarter of the season when they posted a 22‚Äì16 record by mid May. This was due to a dominant pitching rotation with Aaron Nola and Vince Velasquez earning the most praise. This wouldn't last as they would eventually collapse from a promising start to finish 71-91 and miss the playoffs for the fifth consecutive year. Ryan Howard would not be signed again and Carlos Ruiz would be traded removing the last of the original 2008 Phillies core from the roster. =2017: Regression= The Phillies would take a step back this season as the pitching and offense remained inconsistent throughout the season. One of the lone bright spots on the team was Rhys Hoskins who was called up from Triple-A as he would hit 18 home runs in just 34 games. The Phillies would regress from the 2016 season to 66-96 and miss the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year. At the end of the season Pete Mackanin stepped down as the head coach of the Phillies and would instead take an office role with the Phillies. 2018‚Äìpresent: Slow rise =2018: Promising future= The Phillies would name Gabe Kapler as the next head coach of the Philadelphia Phillies on October 30, 2017. Kapler was a retired baseball player who last played for the Tampa Bay Rays in 2010. Kapler and the Phillies were surprise contenders in the NL East as they would trade places with the Washington Nationals and the Atlanta Braves. The Phillies would collapse at the end of the season going an abysmal 8‚Äì20 in September to end 80-82 and miss the playoffs for the seventh consecutive year. =2019: Major signings= Because of the amount of money available for the Phillies to spend, many reporters believed the Phillies would make a lot free agent signings to add onto a promising 2018 season. The Phillies would sign Andrew McCutchen to a three-year deal, trade for Jean Segura and J. T. Realmuto, and sign Bryce Harper to a record setting (at the time as Mike Trout would sign an even bigger contract later in the season) 13-year, $330 million contract. In the first Phillies at bat of the season, Andrew McCutchen hit a home run which would help the Phillies win opening day against the Braves. The Phillies went on to sweep the reigning NL East champs Braves in the first series of the season, and they started 4-0 after routing the Nationals in the fourth game of the season, where Bryce Harper hit his first home run against his former team. While the team started off very well, midseason slumps, injuries suffered by many outfielders and bullpen players, and general underperformance as the season drew to a close led to the team finishing with an 81‚Äì81 record, and again missing the playoffs. While the team was showing glimpses of a bright future to come, there were some glaring problems that needed to be addressed. On October 10, 2019, Gabe Kapler was fired as manager of the Phillies. =2020: Beginning of Joe Girardi era= The Phillies started the offseason by hiring Joe Girardi as their new manager of the Phillies. The Phillies would address their starting pitching by signing Zack Wheeler to a five-year, $118 million contract. During the offseason they would not resign Maikel Franco and C√©sar Hern√°ndez making them free agents. To fill the void in the infield, the Phillies would sign shortstop Didi Gregorius to a one-year, $14 million contract. The year was plagued by underperformance, specifically from the bullpen, which, if extended over a full 162 games (the season was shortened due to COVID), would be among the worst bullpens in baseball history. High points of the season included a stretch in which Bryce Harper was in the MVP conversation, and when, after losing consecutive games in which the team had a lead which prompted Harper to say that the team needed to win 9 of 10 games, the team did just that. To close out the season, the Phillies went 2-6, getting swept by the Rays in the final series to miss out on the playoffs. The Phillies lost over 15 games in which they had a lead in the 60 game season.

In conventional in vitro systems, each cell type is studied in isolation ignoring critical interactions between organs or cell types. IdMOC technology is based on the concept that multiple organs signal or communicate via the systemic circulation (i.e., blood). Schematic representation of an IdMOC plate The IdMOC plate consists of multiple inner wells within a large interconnecting chamber. Multiple cell types are first individually seeded in the inner wells and, when required, are flooded with an overlying medium to facilitate well-to-well communication. Test material can be added to the overlying medium and both media and cells can be analyzed individually. Plating of hepatocytes with other organ-specific cells allows evaluation of drug metabolism and organotoxicity.Li AP, Bode C, Sakai Y.

Chem Biol Interact. 2004 Nov 1;150(1):129-36 The IdMOC system has numerous applications in drug development, such as the evaluation of drug metabolism and toxicity. It can simultaneously evaluate the toxic potential of a drug on cells from multiple organs and evaluate drug stability, distribution, metabolite formation, and efficacy. By modeling multiple-organ interactions, IdMOC can examine the pharmacological effects of a drug and its metabolites on target and off-target organs as well as evaluate drug-drug interactions by measuring cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction or inhibition in hepatocytes. IdMOC can also be used for routine and high throughput screening of drugs with desirable ADME or ADME-Tox properties. In vitro toxicity screening using hepatocytes in conjunction with other primary cells such as cardiomyocytes (cardiotoxicity model), kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (nephrotoxicity model), astrocytes (neurotoxicity model), endothelial cells (vascular toxicity model), and airway epithelial cells (pulmonary toxicity model) is invaluable to the drug design and discovery process.Li, AP.

World War I  The squadron was first formed during the First World War, from two former Royal Naval Air Service flights, No. 439 and No. 440, on 27 September 1918 at Souda Bay, Crete. It performed anti-submarine patrols with the Short 184 floatplanes, over the Aegean. 264 Squadron was disbanded, following the end of the war, on 1 March 1919. World War II Boulton Paul Defiant gunner of 264 Squadron entering his turret at RAF Kirton in Lindsey On 8 December 1939 it was re-formed at RAF Station Martlesham Heath to bring the Boulton Paul Defiant fighter into service. Operations began in March 1940 when the squadron started convoy patrols. After initial successes, the Luftwaffe soon realised that the Defiant was vulnerable to frontal attack, and the squadron started to have heavy losses of aircraft and crew. At the end of May 1940 the squadron was withdrawn from day fighting operations and began to train in the night fighter role. It was called into action again in day fighting at the height of the Battle of Britain, but again suffered losses and returned to night fighting. After a number of moves around England, including Luton Airport,History Of London Luton Airport (website accessed: 16.07.2010) in May 1942 the squadron moved to RAF Colerne to operate the de Havilland Mosquito II, later trading them in for the later Mark VI. The Mosquitos were operated as night fighters in the west of England, and on day patrols in the Bay of Biscay and western approaches. In 1943, after concentrating on night intruder missions, the squadron operated in support of the Bomber Command, defending bomber formations against enemy night-fighters. In 1944 it re-equipped with the newer Mosquito XIII and returned to defensive roles. In June it carried out patrols over the Normandy beaches, until returning to night patrols from western England in the western approaches. As the Allied forces advanced, the squadron became part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force providing night patrols. By the end of the war it was carrying out patrols over Berlin from its airfield at Twente in the Netherlands. It was disbanded at Twente on 25 August 1945. Postwar operations Gloster Meteor NF.14 of 264 Squadron in 1955 The squadron was re- formed again on 20 November 1945 at RAF Church Fenton when 125 Squadron was renumbered. It operated the de Havilland Mosquito NF30 and NF36 in the night fighter role as part of the peacetime Fighter Command. By 1951 the squadron was posted to RAF Linton-on-Ouse, where that November its Mosquitos were replaced by the Gloster Meteor NF11, and in October 1954 by the Gloster Meteor NF14. From February 1957 the squadron was based at RAF Middleton St George until 30 September 1957, when it was disbanded after being re-numbered 33 Squadron at RAF Leeming.

It includes at least twenty separate settlement sites with documented occupation dates from 2500 BCE to recent (post-contact) history. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. The site is partly occupied by the Brooks Camp, one of the major visitor areas of the park. Description The Brooks River is a relatively short river which connects Brooks Lake to Naknek Lake on the upper part of the Alaska Peninsula in Katmai National Park and Preserve. The river is the site of a salmon run that attracts large numbers of bears, and has been used since the establishment of the park as a hunting, fishing, and sightseeing location. Brooks Camp is located on the north bank of the river, near Brooks Falls. Since the 1960s the area has been the subject of regular archaeological activity, often in regard to the management of the facilities at the camp. This research has regularly exposed evidence of human habitation in the area. The geological history of the site provides remarkably well-demarcated periods of occupation, because regular volcanic activity in the region has deposited a number of (sometimes deep) ash layers in the area. The most recent of these eruptions was that of Novarupta in 1912, which was at least partly responsible for the creation of Katmai National Park. The eruption resulted in the destruction of a number of Native villages (including Savonoski), closer to the volcano, and the Brooks River area was one place they migrated to afterward. Bedded between the deposits of at least ten separate major volcanic events dating back to 6500 BCE, are numerous occurrences of evidence of human habitation. The oldest sites found at Brooks River date to c. 3000 BCE. Finds include the remains of pit houses (similar to barabaras), stone tools, projectile points, and evidence of toolmaking (debitage). Some of the oldest discoveries were made when the National Park Service wanted to prepare the site of a house for public display: during the excavation of one of the candidate sites, rains prompted the digging of a trench to channel water away from that site, and resulted in the discovery of additional sites in the new trench.

The prokaryotic cytoskeletal elements are matched with their eukaryotic homologue and hypothesized cellular function. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is the collective name for all structural filaments in prokaryotes. It was once thought that prokaryotic cells did not possess cytoskeletons, but advances in visualization technology and structure determination led to the discovery of filaments in these cells in the early 1990s. Not only have analogues for all major cytoskeletal proteins in eukaryotes been found in prokaryotes, cytoskeletal proteins with no known eukaryotic homologues have also been discovered. Cytoskeletal elements play essential roles in cell division, protection, shape determination, and polarity determination in various prokaryotes. FtsZ FtsZ, the first identified prokaryotic cytoskeletal element, forms a filamentous ring structure located in the middle of the cell called the Z-ring that constricts during cell division, similar to the actin-myosin contractile ring in eukaryotes. The Z-ring is a highly dynamic structure that consists of numerous bundles of protofilaments that extend and shrink, although the mechanism behind Z-ring contraction and the number of protofilaments involved are unclear. FtsZ acts as an organizer protein and is required for cell division. It is the first component of the septum during cytokinesis, and it recruits all other known cell division proteins to the division site. Despite this functional similarity to actin, FtsZ is homologous to eukaryal tubulin. Although comparison of the primary structures of FtsZ and tubulin reveal a weak relationship, their 3-dimensional structures are remarkably similar. Furthermore, like tubulin, monomeric FtsZ is bound to GTP and polymerizes with other FtsZ monomers with the hydrolysis of GTP in a mechanism similar to tubulin dimerization. Since FtsZ is essential for cell division in bacteria, this protein is a target for the design of new antibiotics. There currently exist several models and mechanisms that regulate Z-ring formation, but these mechanisms depend on the species. Several rod shaped species, including Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus, use one or more inhibitors of FtsZ assembly that form a bipolar gradient in the cell, enhancing polymerization of FtsZ at the cell center. One of these gradient-forming systems consists of MinCDE proteins (see below). MreB MreB is a bacterial protein believed to be analogous to eukaryal actin. MreB and actin have a weak primary structure match, but are very similar in terms of 3-D structure and filament polymerization. Almost all non-spherical bacteria rely on MreB to determine their shape. MreB assembles into a helical network of filamentous structures just under the cytoplasmic membrane, covering the whole length of the cell. MreB determines cell shape by mediating the position and activity of enzymes that synthesize peptidoglycan and by acting as a rigid filament under the cell membrane that exerts outward pressure to sculpt and bolster the cell. MreB condenses from its normal helical network and forms a tight ring at the septum in Caulobacter crescentus right before cell division, a mechanism that is believed to help locate its off-center septum. MreB is also important for polarity determination in polar bacteria, as it is responsible for the correct positioning of at least four different polar proteins in C. crescentus. Crescentin Crescentin (encoded by creS gene) is an analogue of eukaryotic intermediate filaments (IFs). Unlike the other analogous relationships discussed here, crescentin has a rather large primary homology with IF proteins in addition to three-dimensional similarity - the sequence of creS has a 25% identity match and 40% similarity to cytokeratin 19 and a 24% identity match and 40% similarity to nuclear lamin A. Furthermore, crescentin filaments are roughly 10 nm in diameter and thus fall within diameter range for eukaryal IFs (8-15 nm). Crescentin forms a continuous filament from pole to pole alongside the inner, concave side of the crescent-shaped bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Both MreB and crescentin are necessary for C. crescentus to exist in its characteristic shape; it is believed that MreB molds the cell into a rod shape and crescentin bends this shape into a crescent. ParM and SopA ParM is a cytoskeletal element that possesses a similar structure to actin, although it behaves functionally like tubulin. Further, it polymerizes bidirectionally and it exhibits dynamic instability, which are both behaviors characteristic of tubulin polymerization. It forms a system with ParR and parC that is responsible for R1 plasmid separation. ParM affixes to ParR, a DNA-binding protein that specifically binds to 10 direct repeats in the parC region on the R1 plasmid. This binding occurs on both ends of the ParM filament. This filament is then extended, separating the plasmids. The system is analogous to eukaryotic chromosome segregation as ParM acts like eukaryotic tubulin in the mitotic spindle, ParR acts like the kinetochore complex, and parC acts like the centromere of the chromosome. F plasmid segregation occurs in a similar system where SopA acts as the cytoskeletal filament and SopB binds to the sopC sequence in the F plasmid, like the kinetochore and centromere respectively. Lately an actin-like ParM homolog has been found in a gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, which assembles into a microtubule-like structure and is involved in plasmid segregation. MinCDE system The MinCDE system is a filament system that properly positions the septum in the middle of the cell in Escherichia coli. According to Shih et al., MinC inhibits the formation of the septum by prohibiting the polymerization of the Z-ring. MinC, MinD, and MinE form a helix structure that winds around the cell and is bound to the membrane by MinD. The MinCDE helix occupies a pole and terminates in a filamentous structure called the E-ring made of MinE at the middle-most edge of the polar zone. From this configuration, the E-ring will contract and move toward that pole, disassembling the MinCDE helix as it moves along. Concomitantly, the disassembled fragments will reassemble at the opposite polar end, reforming the MinCDE coil on the opposite pole while the current MinCDE helix is broken down. This process then repeats, with the MinCDE helix oscillating from pole to pole. This oscillation occurs repeatedly during the cell cycle, thereby keeping MinC (and its septum inhibiting effect) at a lower time-averaged concentration at the middle of the cell than at the ends of the cell. The dynamic behavior of the Min proteins has been reconstituted in vitro using an artificial lipid bilayer as mimic for the cell membrane. MinE and MinD self- organized into parallel and spiral protein waves by a reaction-diffusion like mechanism. Bactofilin Bactofilin () is a cytoskeletal element that forms filaments throughout the cells of the rod-shaped proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus. The bactofilin protein, BacM, is required for proper cell shape maintenance and cell wall integrity. M. xanthus cells lacking BacM have a deformed morphology characterized by a bent cell body, and bacM mutants have decreased resistance to antibiotics targeting the bacterial cell wall. M. xanthus BacM protein is cleaved from its full-length form to allow polymerization. Bactofilins have been implicated in cell shape regulation in other bacteria, including curvature of Proteus mirabilis cells, stalk formation by Caulobacter crescentus, and helical shape of Helicobacter pylori. Crenactin Crenactin is an actin homologue unique to the archaeal kingdom Crenarchaeota that has been found in the orders Thermoproteales and Candidatus Korarchaeum. It has the highest sequence similarity to eukaryotic actins of any known actin homologue. Crenactin has been well characterized in Pyryobaculum calidifontis () and shown to have high specificity for ATP and GTP. Species containing crenactin are all rod or needle shaped and in P. calidifontis Crenactin has been shown to form helical structures that span the length of the cell, suggesting a role for crenactin in shape determination similar to that of MreB in other prokaryotes. CfpA Within the phylum Spirochaetes, a number of species share a filamentous cytoplasmic ribbon structure formed by individual filaments, composed of the protein CfpA (Cytoplasmic filament protein A, ), linked together by bridging components and by anchors to the inner membrane. While present in genera Treponema, Spirochaeta, Pillotina, Leptonema, Hollandina and Diplocalyx, they are however, absent in some species as per the example of Treponema primitia. With a cross-section dimension of 5 x 6 nm (horizontal/vertical) they fall within diameter range of eukaryal intermediate filaments (IFs) (8-15 nm). Treponema denticola cells lacking the CfpA protein form long concatenated cells with a chromosomal DNA segregation defect, a phenotype also affecting the pathogenicity of this organism. The absence of another cell ultrastructure, the periplasmic flagella filament bundle, do not alter the structure of the cytoplasmic ribbon.

Bonding Comparison between hydrogen and halogen bonding: ;Hydrogen bonding: A \\\\cdots H-D ;Halogen bonding: A \\\\cdots X-D In both cases, A (the hydrogen/halogen bond acceptor) is the atom, group, or molecule that donates electrons to the electron poor species H-D or X-D (the hydrogen or halogen bond donors respectively). H is the hydrogen atom involved in hydrogen bonding, and X is the halogen atom involved in halogen bonding. Note the halogen bond donor accepts electrons while the halogen bond acceptor donates electrons. A parallel relationship can easily be drawn between halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding (HB). In both types of bonding, an electron donor/electron acceptor relationship exists. The difference between the two is what species can act as the electron donor/electron acceptor. In hydrogen bonding, a hydrogen atom acts as the electron acceptor and forms a non- covalent interaction by accepting electron density from an electron rich site (electron donor). In halogen bonding, a halogen atom is the electron acceptor. Simultaneously, the normal covalent bond between H or X and D weakens, so the electron density on H or X appears to be reduced. Electron density transfers results in a penetration of the van der Waals volumes. Figure 2: XB in complex between iodine monochloride and trimethylamine. Halogens participating in halogen bonding include: iodine (I), bromine (Br), chlorine (Cl), and sometimes fluorine (F). All four halogens are capable of acting as XB donors (as proven through theoretical and experimental data) and follow the general trend: F < Cl < Br < I, with iodine normally forming the strongest interactions. Dihalogens (I2, Br2, etc.) tend to form strong halogen bonds. The strength and effectiveness of chlorine and fluorine in XB formation depend on the nature of the XB donor. If the halogen is bonded to an electronegative (electron withdrawing) moiety, it is more likely to form stronger halogen bonds. For example, iodoperfluoroalkanes are well-designed for XB crystal engineering. In addition, this is also why F2 can act as a strong XB donor, but fluorocarbons are weak XB donors because the alkyl group connected to the fluorine is not electronegative. In addition, the Lewis base (XB acceptor) tends to be electronegative as well and anions are better XB acceptors than neutral molecules. Halogen bonds are strong, specific, and directional interactions that give rise to well-defined structures. Halogen bond strengths range from 5‚Äì180 kJ/mol. The strength of XB allows it to compete with HB, which are a little bit weaker in strength. Halogen bonds tend to form at 180¬∞ angles, which was shown in Odd Hassel‚Äôs studies with bromine and 1,4-dioxane in 1954. Another contributing factor to halogen bond strength comes from the short distance between the halogen (Lewis acid, XB donor) and Lewis base (XB acceptor). The attractive nature of halogen bonds result in the distance between the donor and acceptor to be shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii. The XB interaction becomes stronger as the distance decreases between the halogen and Lewis base. History In 1814, Jean-Jacques Colin described the formation of a liquid ‚Äî with a metallic lustre ‚Äî when he mixed together dry gaseous ammonia and dry iodine. The precise composition of the resulting I2¬∑¬∑¬∑NH3 complex was established fifty years later by Frederick Guthrie. In his experiment, he added I2 to aqueous ammonia. The true nature of the molecular interaction was perhaps first understood only half of a century ago following Robert Mulliken's groundbreaking discoveries on charge-transfer interactions, and their detailed description by Odd Hassel. In 1950s, Robert S. Mulliken developed a detailed theory of electron donor-acceptor complexes, classifying them as being outer or inner complexes. Outer complexes were those in which the intermolecular interaction between the electron donor and acceptor were weak and had very little charge transfer. Inner complexes have extensive charge redistribution. Mulliken‚Äôs theory has been used to describe the mechanism by which XB formation occurs. Figure 3: Chains in the 1:1 adduct of 1,4-dioxane and bromine. In 1954, Hassel provided evidence for the first X-ray crystallography study done with halogen bonding. Around the same time period that Mulliken developed his theory, crystallographic studies performed by Hassel began to emerge and became a turning point in the comprehension of XB formation and its characteristics. The first X-ray crystallography study from Hassel‚Äôs group came in 1954. In the experiment, his group was able to show the structure of bromine 1,4-dioxanate using x-ray diffraction techniques. The experiment revealed that a short intermolecular interaction was present between the oxygen atoms of dioxane and bromine atoms. The O‚àíBr distance in the crystal was measured at 2.71 √Ö, which indicates a strong interaction between the bromine and oxygen atoms. In addition, the distance is smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii of oxygen and bromine (3.35 √Ö). The angle between the O‚àíBr and Br‚àíBr bond is about 180¬∞. This was the first evidence of the typical characteristics found in halogen bond formation and led Hassel to conclude that halogen atoms are directly linked to electron pair donor with a bond direction that coincides with the axes of the orbitals of the lone pairs in the electron pair donor molecule. In 1969, Hassel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his outstanding discovery that halogens can act as electrophilic, electron acceptors, and self-assemble into highly directionally organised crystalline charge-transfer complexes in presence of electron donors. An early review about electron donor-acceptor was provided by Bent in 1968. The use of the term \\"halogen bond\\" was not implemented until 1978 by Dumas and coworkers, who investigated complexes of CCl4, CBr4, SiCl4, and SiBr4 with tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, pyridine, anisole, and di-n-butyl ether in organic solvents. However, it was not until the mid-1990s, that the nature and applications of the halogen bond began to be intensively studied. Systematic and extensive work by Legon and coworkers, who studied a wide variety of halogen-bonded adducts formed in the gas phase via microwave spectroscopy, drew attention to the similarities between halogen-bonding and better-known hydrogen-bonding interactions. Computational calculations by Politzer and Murray were particularly significant as they revealed that the high directionality of the halogen bond is the result of an anisotropic distribution of electron density around the halogen nucleus and paved the way to the definition of the ‚ÄúœÉ-hole‚Äù. Currently, XB is being exploited for a range of functional applications, e.g., crystal engineering, supramolecular chemistry, polymer sciences, liquid crystals, conductive materials and medicinal chemistry. Applications =Crystal engineering= Br¬∑¬∑¬∑O halogen bonds observed in crystal structure of 3D silsesquioxanes. Crystal engineering is a growing research area that bridges solid-state and supramolecular chemistry. This unique field is interdisciplinary and merges traditional disciplines such as crystallography, organic chemistry, and inorganic chemistry. In 1971, Schmidt first established the field with a publication on photodimerization in the solid-state. The more recent definition identifies crystal engineering as the utilization of the intermolecular interactions for crystallization and for the development of new substances with different desired physicochemical properties. Before the discovery of halogen bonding, the approach for crystal engineering involved using hydrogen bonding, coordination chemistry and inter-ion interactions for the development of liquid-crystalline and solid-crystalline materials. Furthermore, halogen bonding is employed for the organization of radical cationic salts, fabrication of molecular conductors, and creation of liquid crystal constructs. Since the discovery of halogen bonding, new molecular assemblies exist. Due to the unique chemical nature of halogen bonding, this intermolecular interaction serves as an additional tool for the development of crystal engineering. The first reported use of halogen bonding in liquid crystal formation was by H. Loc Nguyen. In an effort to form liquid crystals, alkoxystilbazoles and pentafluoroiodobenzene were used. Previous studies by Metrangolo and Resnati demonstrated the utility of pentafluoroiodobenzene for solid-state structures. Various alkoxystilbazoles have been utilized for nonlinear optics and metallomesogens. Using another finding of Resnati (e.g. N‚àíI complexes form strongly), the group engineered halogen-bonded complexes with iodopentafluorobenzene and 4-alkoxystilbazoles. X-ray crystallography revealed a N‚àíI distance of 2.811(4) √Ö and the bonding angle to be 168.4¬∞. Similar N‚àíI distances were measured in solid powders. The N‚àíI distance discovered is shorter than the sum of the Van Der Waals radii for nitrogen and iodine (3.53 √Ö). The single crystal structure of the molecules indicated that no quadrupolar interactions were present. The complexes in Figure 4 were found to be liquid-crystalline. To test the notion of polarizability involvement in the strength of halogen bonding, bromopentafluorbenzene was used as a Lewis base. Consequently, verification of halogen bond complex formation wasn‚Äôt obtained. This finding provides more support for the dependence of halogen bonding on atomic polarizability. Utilizing similar donor-acceptor frameworks, the authors demonstrated that halogen bonding strength in the liquid crystalline state is comparable to the hydrogen-bonded mesogens.  Preparation of poly(diiododiacetylene)  PIDA, monomer, and host scaffolds used. Applications utilizing properties of conjugated polymers emerged from work done by Heeger, McDiaramid, and Shirakawa with the discovery that polyacetylene is a conducting, albeit difficult to process material. Since then, work has been done to mimic this conjugated polymer‚Äôs backbone (e.g., poly(p-phenylenevinylene)). Conjugated polymers have many practical applications, and are used in devices such as photovoltaic cells, organic light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and chemical sensors. Goroff et al. prepared ordered poly(diiododiacetylene) (PIDA) via prearrangement of monomer (2) with a halogen bond scaffolding. PIDA is an excellent precursor to other conjugated polymers, as Iodine can be easily transformed. For instance, C‚àíI cleavage is possible electrochemical reduction. Crystal structures of monomer (2) are disordered materials of varying composition and connectivity. Hosts (3‚Äì7) were investigated for their molecular packing, primarily by studying co-crystals of monomer (2) and respective host. Both (3) and (4) pre- organized monomer (2), but steric crowding around the iodines prevented successful topological polymerization of the monomer. Hosts (5‚Äì7) utilize hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds to hold monomer (2) at an optimal distance from each other to facilitate polymerization. In fact, when host 7 was used, polymerization occurred spontaneously upon isolation of the co-crystals. Crystal structures show the polymer strands are all parallel to the hydrogen- bonding network, and the host nitriles are each halogen-bonded to iodine atoms. Half of the iodine atoms in (1) in the crystal are in close contact to the oxalamide oxygen atoms. Oxygen atoms of host 7 are acting as both hydrogen and halogen bond acceptors. Above is the molecular packing of the co-crystal of 2 and 6. The repeat distance is 5.25 √Ö, with a declination angle of 51.3Àö. Above is a representation of a crystal structure of 1 and 7. As shown, the oxalamide oxygen (in purple) forms a hydrogen bond with the amide below (blue dashed line) and forms a weak halogen bond with the iodine on 1 (purple dashed line). This weak halogen bond further stabilizes this co-crystal. Halogen bond between the nitrile and iodine is represented with a red dashed line. Porous structures Porous inclusion complexes 1 and 2. Porous structures have a variety of uses. Many chemists and material scientists are working to improve metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to store hydrogen to use in cars. These highly organized crystalline inclusion complexes have potential uses in catalysis and molecular separation devices. Molecular organization is often controlled via intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding. However, utilizing hydrogen bonding often limits the range of pore sizes available due to close packing. Pigge, et al., utilized halogen bonding interactions between amines, nitrogen heterocycles, carbonyl groups, and other organic halides, to construct their porous structures. This is significant because organic crystalline networks mediated by halogen bonds, an interaction significantly weaker than hydrogen bond, are rare. Crystal structures of 1 and 2 [below] were obtained in a variety of solvents, such as dichloromethane, pyridine, and benzene. The authors note that the porous inclusion complexes appear to be mediated in part by unprecedented I-œÄ interactions and by halogen bond between iodine and carbonyl groups. The crystal structure [shown below] come together in a triangular array and molecules of 2 are approximately symmetric. Additionally, all of the sets of halogen bonding interactions are not identical, and all of the intermolecular interactions between halogen and halogen bond acceptor slightly exceed the sum of the Van der Waals radius, signifying a slightly weaker halogen bond, which leads to more flexibility in the structure. The 2D layers stack parallel to each other to produce channels filled with solvent. 2-D layers of 2:3CHCl3. Halogen bonds are shown in red, and the solvent molecules are not shown. This motif is mediated with halogen bonds and halogen-œÄ interactions. Solvent interactions are also noted in the formation of the hexagonal structures, especially in pyridine and chloroform. Initially, crystals that form these solutions form channeled structures. Over time, new needle-like solvate-free structures form are packed tighter together, and these needles are actually the thermodynamically favored crystal. The authors hope to use this information to better understand the complementary nature of hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds in order to design small molecules predict structures. =Halogen bonding in biological macromolecules= For some time, the significance of halogen bonding to biological macromolecular structure was overlooked. Based on single-crystal structures in the protein data bank (PDB) (July 2004 version), a study by Auffinger and others on single crystals structures with 3 √Ö resolution or better entered into the PDB revealed that over 100 halogen bonds were found in six halogenated-based nucleic acid structures and sixty-six protein-substrate complexes for halogen-oxygen interactions. Although not as frequent as halogen-oxygen interactions, halogen-nitrogen and halogen-sulfur contacts were identified as well. These scientific findings provide a unique basis for elucidating the role of halogen bonding in biological systems. On the bio- molecular level, halogen bonding is important for substrate specificity, binding and molecular folding. In the case of protein-ligand interactions, the most common charge-transfer bonds with polarizable halogens involve backbone carbonyls and/or hydroxyl and carboxylate groups of amino acid residues. Typically in DNA and protein-ligand complexes, the bond distance between Lewis base donor atoms (e.g. O, S, N) and Lewis acid (halogen) is shorter than the sum of their Van der Waals radius. Depending on the structural and chemical environment, halogen bonding interactions can be weak or strong. In the case of some protein-ligand complexes, halogen bonds are energetically and geometrically comparable to that of hydrogen bonding if the donor-acceptor directionality remains consistent. This intermolecular interaction has been shown to be stabilizing and a conformational determinant in protein-ligand and DNA structures. For molecular recognition and binding, halogen bonding can be significant. An example of this assertion in drug design is the substrate specificity for the binding of IDD 594 to human aldose reductase. E.I. Howard reported the best resolution for this monomeric enzyme. This biological macromolecule consists of 316 residues, and it reduces aldoses, corticosteroids, and aldehydes. D-sorbitol, a product of the enzymatic conversion of D-glucose, is thought to contribute to the downstream effects of the pathology of diabetes. Hence, inhibiting this enzyme has therapeutic merit. Aldehyde-based and carboxylate inhibitors are effective but toxic because the functional activity of aldehyde reductase is impaired. Carboxylate and aldehyde inhibitors were shown to hydrogen bond with Trp 111, Tyr 48, and His 110. The ‚Äúspecificity pocket,‚Äù created as a result of inhibitor binding, consists of Leu 300, Ala 299, Phe 122, Thr 113, and Trp 111. For inhibitors to be effective, the key residues of interaction were identified to be Thr 113 and Trp 111. IDD 594 was designed such that the halogen would provide selectivity and be potent. Upon binding, this compound induces a conformational change that causes halogen bonding to occur between the oxygen of the Thr and the bromine of the inhibitor. The bond distance was measured to be 2.973(4) √Ö. It is this O‚àíBr halogen bond that contributes to the large potency of this inhibitor for human aldose reductase rather than aldehyde reductase. Within the specificity pocket of the protein-inhibitor complex, a short Br‚àíO halogen bond contributes to inhibitor potency.

It was the first public general hospital established in the province and the largest such facility throughout its history. The facility was established by the provincial government on January 28, 1884 on a property known as \\"Haszard House\\" located at present-day 24-36 Longworth Avenue in the northeast part of the city. The Prince Edward Island Hospital was predated by the Charlottetown Hospital, which was established in 1879 by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlottetown. The city's residents demanded that the government open \\"a general\\" hospital that was not affiliated with a religious body. As such, the Prince Edward Island Hospital was frequently referred to as the \\"Protestant\\" hospital, however the facility was secular and had no affiliation with a religious denomination. In 1891 the first nursing school in the province was opened when the Prince Edward Island Hospital School of Nursing was established. In 1896 the trustees of the Prince Edward Island Hospital foresaw a greater need than Haszard House could provide and accepted the gift of Rev. Ralph Brecken's property at present-day 31 Kensington Road in the neighbouring then-rural community of Parkdale. Architect C.B. Chappell was commissioned to design and build the large brick building in June 1898 and it opened in March 1900. By the 1920s it became apparent that the Kensington Road location for the hospital was becoming over-crowded, thus the provincial government built a much larger facility on the northern part of the Government House property adjacent to Victoria Park. This new building opened in 1934 at present-day 5 Brighton Road. In 1969 the provincial government took over the operation of the Charlottetown Hospital from the Roman Catholic Church as part of the provincial development plan under premier Alex Campbell. The Prince Edward Island Hospital and the Charlottetown Hospital were identified for replacement with a single modern facility. The Prince Edward Island Hospital School of Nursing was merged with other nursing schools in the province in 1969 to form the Prince Edward Island School of Nursing. This education facility closed in 1994 when its diploma programs transferred to the bachelor program at the University of Prince Edward Island. In 1982, after 97 years of service, the Prince Edward Island Hospital closed its doors when the Queen Elizabeth Hospital opened. The opening of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in 1982 also saw the end of abortion services in the province, which had been provided at the Prince Edward Island Hospital since the late 1960s. One of the conditions that the Roman Catholic Church placed on the provincial government of Premier James Lee for merging the Catholic-affiliated Charlottetown Hospital with the secular and publicly operated Prince Edward Island Hospital into the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital was that all abortion services in the province be discontinued. Prince Edward Home In 1982 the Prince Edward Island Hospital building at 5 Brighton Road was re-purposed by the provincial government and called the Prince Edward Home. From 1982 to 2014 the building was used for the following health care services: * Palliative Care * Convalescent/Restorative Care * Respite Care * Long-Term Nursing Home Care for individuals over the age of 60 who do not require acute general hospital care * Long-Term Medical Nursing Care for individuals under the age of 60 and who suffer from chronic disabilities In November 2013 a new \\"provincial manor\\" opened in the neighbourhood of West Royalty and residents were moved to that location.120 P.E.I. seniors move into new home A new palliative care facility which opened in 2014, has left the building at 5 Brighton Rd with no purpose in 2015 and it is expected to be decommissioned.Palliative care facility gets go-ahead on heritage site The adjacent building that housed the Prince Edward Island Hospital School of Nursing was re-purposed by the provincial government and currently houses offices for the Department of Education and called the Aubin Arsenault Building.

Stocking may be done for the benefit of commercial, recreational, or tribal fishing, but may also be done to restore or increase a population of threatened or endangered fish in a body of water closed to fishing. Fish stocking may be conducted by governmental agencies in public waters, or by private groups in private waters. When in public waters, fish stocking creates a common-pool resource which is rivalrous in nature but non-excludable. Thus, on public grounds, all can enjoy the benefits of fishing so long as fish continue to be stocked. History Fish stocking is a practice that dates back hundreds of years. According to biologist Edwin Pister, widespread trout stocking dates back to the 1800s. For the first hundred years of stocking, the location and number of fish introduced was not well recorded; the singular goal of stocking was to enhance sport fishing regardless of ecological ramifications such as erosion of biodiversity. As biologist Edwin Pister states, \\"When trout planting was first implemented, the nation was gripped with a highly utilitarian resource management ethic that placed short-term human interests above virtually any other consideration\\". Recently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service along with state fishery branches have done a better job of recording exactly what species of fish are stocked at any given location. This began in the 1960s when research suggested the negative impacts of fish stocking on the ecological complexity of other life forms. The Wilderness Act of 1964 also opened the public's eyes to the impact stocking has on other organisms. Thus, fish stocking is now the subject of much debate as there are various costs and benefits associated with the practice. In the United States, stocking non-native fish for sport and food was just beginning in 1871 when the US Fish Commission was established. The head of the new agency, Spencer Fullerton Baird, was tasked to research \\"the decrease of the food fishes of the seacoasts and the lakes of the United States and to suggest remedial measures.\\" Baird made his headquarters at Woods Hole on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. There, his team of scientists and researchers conducted studies on striped bass, blue fish, and many other commercial and sport fish. They compiled their research into a 255-page report on United States fish resources. Congress granted the team $15,000 to develop food fish stocks, and nonnative fish such as rainbow trout, salmon, striped bass, and carp were subsequently introduced successfully into United States lakes and rivers.Ben Schley (1971) \\"A Century of Fish Conservation (1871-1971)\\" US Fish and Wildlife Service. In the early years, fish were stocked by sports clubs and private citizens. Today, state fish and wildlife agencies along with hatcheries are responsible for distributing fish. And until recently, their goal was to plant as many fish as possible into as many bodies of water as possible. Now, with knowledge of the detrimental effects fish stocking has on invertebrate and amphibian populations, it is conducted much more selectively. Stocking today Today, much more thought is put into introducing non-native species as they can severely damage the populations of fragile natives; practices lean more towards sustainability. Stocking is used to restore native species to waters where they have been overfished or can no longer breed. \\"Give and take\\" stocking practices are those where fish are stocked only to be fished and then restocked. In response, most states have adopted regulations that prohibit fish stocking in areas that may damage aquatic life or ecosystem diversity, and encourage stocking in bodies of water where no harm will result from doing so. Trout Unlimited has a policy, for example, that states \\"where a body of scientific evidence shows that stocking in historically non-salmonid waters adversely affects native biodiversity, such stocking should cease.\\" While many organizations remain focused solely on providing quality fishing opportunities, policies and attitudes are shifting toward resource integrity and protection. Costs and benefits of fish stocking In Pennsylvania alone, the PA Fish & Boat Commission is scheduled to stock 4,398,227 trout (brook, brown, and rainbows) into its streams and lakes in 2019. Also in 2019, Lake Ontario, one of the five great lakes, is projected to receive 2,767,660 stocked salmon and trout. According to data by state agencies, in 2004 roughly 1.7 billion fish were stocked across the United States. With 104 different species of fish stocked, a total of 43.65 million pounds of fish were released, primarily in the Western states. In the US, common species that are currently stocked for sport include trout, bass, salmon, muskellunge, walleye, and several species of panfish. Before being released into rivers, lakes, ponds, and occasionally oceans across the country, fish are raised in a fish hatchery. Just like humans have a demand for groceries, anglers have a demand for fish. When the supply is running low in a given body of water, fish are transported from hatcheries in a large water tank or airplane to their respective locations. The costs associated with stocking are typically covered by angler associations, commercial fishermen, state fish and game agencies, and at times government subsidies; today, most stocking is conducted by state fish and game departments. Benefits of stocking Stocking fish provides a variety of benefits to society. Fishing is a popular pastime, with 101.6 million Americans over 16 years old participating in wildlife-related activities such as fishing and hunting. Additionally, a report by the U.S. Department of the Interior recorded an 8% increase in angling participation between 2011 and 2016. In 2017, just over 49 million Americans participated in some form of fishing, of which 11.9 million were youth. Most anglers even fish between four and eleven times per year, with some reporting over 100 trips. Adding fish to public lakes and streams makes fishing more fun, especially for young anglers. Fishing also provides Americans the opportunity to enjoy nature in solitude and escape from their busy lives. It is a form of exercise and a great way to bond with friends and family; fishing has also been linked to increased patience among children. According to a survey by the Outdoor Foundation, 60.3% of fisherman report fishing as a means of getting exercise, 59.1% report fishing to bond with family, and 51.2% report fishing to be close to nature and observe the scenery. Some of the fish caught are also large, providing a source of nutrition to successful fishermen. Roughly 40% of fisherman eat the fish they catch, according to a survey by the Outdoor Foundation. Stocking can also restore threatened, endangered, or native fish species. The Union for Conservation of Nature's red list of endangered species has 1,414 species of fish that are at risk of extinction. Stocking them into lakes, rivers, and streams can support existing populations that are threatened and reduce the number of endangered or extirpated species. Many of the fish commonly used for stocking also have low reproductive rates and tend to be overfished if not stocked annually. Moreover, as stocked fish tend to contain larger trophy fish, many anglers are more willing to pay for a fishing license, meaning state fishing departments have more revenue to spend on natural resource management and conservation efforts. In 2018, there were roughly 30 million paid license holders in the US, grossing $720 million that year. Fishing for stocked trout in Wyoming Many species of fish including grass carp and the suckermouth catfish help clean bodies of water by eating algae and other green organisms. Algae can take over stagnant ponds, attracting insects and making lakes, rivers, and ponds unpleasant to look at. To treat them, many individuals will choose to stock certain species of fish. This creates a positive externality for those who enjoy a variety of water activities. Studies have also examined the economic viability of fish stocking. Hansson, Arrheniusm, and Nellbring of Stockholm University find that simple economic analysis suggests Volga pikeperch stocking can be profitable; based on the capital invested in the stock, the economic yield results in an annual interest rate of 43% (from the viewpoint of anglers). These authors also find that increased populations of stocked fish decreases manpower and equipment costs associated with each catch. They also find that specifically for pikeperch, stocking can restore food web interactions to a more \\"natural\\" level where herring populations are reduced and zooplankton flourish, thus benefiting the ecosystem as a whole. Drawbacks and risks Although there are many benefits of stocking, some groups, including the Pacific Rivers Council, believe that it diverts money away from more effective conservation and protection efforts. In addition, declining populations of native golden trout, a now threatened species, has been linked to stocking of nonnative species. As a matter of fact, 35 species of fish and amphibians have been negatively affected by stocking practices in California. Scientists have established a direct link between nonnative fish stocking and these declines: golden trout, Lahontan cutthroat trout, mountain yellow-legged frog, Yosemite toad, and Cascades frog are all threatened by the practice. Mating between native and introduced fish species can lower the fitness of natural populations, thereby introducing diseases that affect fish and other wildlife. In fact, a study conducted in Virginia streams found that an infectious virus was found only in brook trout populations that had a history of stocking. These diseases may affect humans who consume them as well. Maintaining a balanced ecosystem with biological diversity is also extremely important. Many scientists have claimed that because fish that are stocked tend to be apex predators, native species may become prey and have to compete with the oftentimes larger introduced fish for food and cover. Additionally, the use of aircraft to stock fish in the second half of the twentieth century meant pilots often stocked the wrong lakes or rivers. In many cases, this had disastrous consequences. When fish, specifically trout, are stocked into ecologically sensitive bodies of water, invertebrate populations and amphibians are threatened, altering the natural selection pressures within the ecosystem. Stocked rainbow trout have been outcompeting native brook trout in many southeastern United States bodies of water, for example. Even bird populations such as cormorants are affected. According to findings by the Ecological Society of America, when gulls in the Great Lakes area were examined after fish stocking, they consumed more garbage, presumably due to the decrease in native fish by the predatory stocked fish. Another study found that stocked fish in the Pacific Northwest spread a disease that caused a 15% increase in amphibian embryo mortality. In 2005, the Center for Biological Diversity studied bodies of water across California and found that nonnative trout had been stocked in at least 47 areas where rare species were present, damaging 39 imperiled fish and amphibians. Members of the Wilderness Research Institute claim that fish stocking compromises the \\"naturalness\\" of aquatic ecosystems and that protecting water quality is more important than recreational opportunities. Although stocking programs were designed to boost conservation, in some cases they have harmed them. The increased boat traffic associated with better fishing opportunities creates negative externalities. These include water contamination, congestion, noise pollution, and disruption of wilderness experiences. Fish are stocked all over the world. This river in Mount Aspiring National Park, New Zealand, is stocked with trout. However, there are benefits to fish stocking. Anglers across the country spend millions of dollars through license fees (which benefit state governments) and fishing equipment such as rods, reels, and lures. Members of fishing societies such as the International Game Fish Association and the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society also enjoy fishing in more robust bodies of water. It is important to note that despite the findings mentioned above, Virginia researchers have found that even with stockings of rainbow trout, 80% of fish in its stocked streams are still natives. The Department of Natural Resources in Minnesota also found that stocked muskie can coexist because biologically-based guidelines are used when choosing what and where to stock. Until recently, the ecology of lakes and rivers was not well understood. In order to maximize the benefits of stocking and control the costs, fish must be stocked strategically in places where they can be enjoyed but do not pose a threat to native species. How to stock a private pond When stocking a private pond, it is important to introduce three prey fish for every predator fish. This ensures that predatory fish have enough nutrition to survive and that prey fish can still reproduce. It is also recommended to stock fathead minnows so that both predator and prey fish have enough to feed on. Introducing fish of similar sizes is another important step to ensure that the population grows together. At the same time, make sure that the existing fish in the pond are not significantly larger than the ones being added. For a standard one-quarter acre pond, it is recommended to stock 120 sunfish, 60 yellow perch, 15 largemouth bass, and 8 pounds of fathead minnows. One way to determine what kinds of fish are already living in a given body of water is to monitor local streams, rivers, and lakes and record what species of fish are being caught. The best time to stock is in the spring or fall due to mild temperatures and higher levels of oxygen in the water. To acclimate the fish, place the transportation bag in a shaded part of the water and leave it floating for 15-20 minutes. Before releasing the fish, make sure that larger fish and smaller fish are released at different ends of the pond, giving the prey an opportunity to find shelter. Studies show that releasing small numbers of fish at regular intervals is more effective than releasing all at once, so if possible, plan to release them over a few weeks. It is also important to stock the correct species of fish. For warm water ponds, it is recommended to stock largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, and bullheads. For larger and deeper lakes, stocking cool water game fish such as walleye and trout species is recommended. Lastly, it is important to make sure that no pond or body of water is overstocked. Each has a carrying capacity, meaning that any given body of water can only sustain a certain amount of fish. If this carrying capacity is exceeded, fish will have to compete for food and cover, resulting in damage to all organisms in the water. Legislation Yellowstone has adopted a \\"catch-and-release\\" policy for fishermen Different countries and states have their own regulations regarding fish stocking. These regulations also differ depending on if it is a government office or private individual conducting the stocking. In the past century, many areas have banned fish stocking for a variety of reasons. In 1959, for example, Yellowstone National Park fish stocking was banned due to cross-breeding between native and nonnative species that was harming the genetic uniqueness of existing populations. This makes fish populations more susceptible to disease. Today, Yellowstone has adopted the \\"catch-and-release method\\" to ensure that fishermen release fish back into the water after catching them. There are also restrictions on what types of lures can be used; for example, some sections of the park are open to fly fishing only, a much safer form of fishing that does not damage aquatic life. There is a Native Trout Conservation Area where regulations are structured so that fishermen can selectively remove nonnative fish from the water without damaging native fishery. In 2005, California's Center for Biological Diversity submitted a petition to the Department of Fish and Game requesting that the state initiate a review of its fish stocking practices. The reform campaign aimed to protect existing habitats and native populations of fish and amphibians. Finally, in 2008, the Sacramento Superior Court ordered the state to consult with various groups in finding ways to protect native species from fish stocking practices. Initially, the California Department of Fish and Game agreed to eliminate the environmental harm of its stocking practices, but when it filed its impact report in 2011, protection of native fish and amphibians was clearly not a priority. The agency was brought to court again but was promptly denied. With the state Commission denying the Department of Fish and Game's proposed changes for fish stocking, private hatcheries continue to stock state waters under the same permit regulations. The Department aimed to require that all hatcheries and fisheries pay for biological assessment before stocking, thus preventing many of its negative consequences. However, the state of California made it clear that it will not make fisheries go through the stringent permitting process. In February of 2015, the California Third District of Appeals struck down the Department of Fish and Wildlife's permitting requirement on recreational fishing, which would have essentially driven fish farms and hatcheries out of business. This ruling ensures fishermen in California will have the opportunity to fish in stocked lakes and ponds in the future. Each state has its own regulations regarding fish stocking. Though some state stocking programs restore native populations, others compromise the ecological values of the wilderness areas. The Bureau of Land Management regulates that fishless waters may only be stocked after considering the scientific value of the waters on a case-by-case basis. Fish stocking, however, is not entirely monitored by the Federal government; most current federal regulations hand authority for fish stocking to the states, except on federal lands or when \\"direct involvement of federal wilderness\\" managers is necessary for decision making. Historically, there has been a jurisdictional debate between state and federal agencies, with states arguing that fish stocking is a prerogative supported by the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. Interestingly, the roots of wildlife ownership are grounded in feudal Europe where fish were considered to be common property to all citizens, subject to government control. However, this control over wildlife was transferred to the states with the separation of the Colonies from Britain. Despite the federal government's right to exercise wildlife authority, current regulation states that \\"Congress has, in fact, reaffirmed the basic responsibility and authority of the States to manage fish and resident wildlife.\\" In the future, if more differences in opinion between state and federal managers arise, there may be a need for increased cooperation and coordination between state and federal wilderness managers. Colorado, for example, has regulations to control the stocking of nonnative fish, but only below 6,500 feet. To find out more about each state's fish stocking regulations, visit their respective Department of Fish and Wildlife websites. Today, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (IAFWA), a series of policies for fish management, is used between state and federal agencies to provide a framework for cooperation and coordination related to fish stocking in America.

They offered their company three times for service in the Confederate army, but were denied each time by Governor Pickens. History The company was first organized as a ceremonial unit to honor and commemorate General Lafayette during his visit to Columbia in March 1825. Called the Lafayette Guards,Levasseur, p. 43 they were authorized by Governor Richard Irvine Manning I and were provided with arms from the state armory. The dress uniform worn by the company was a dark grey swallowtail coat, white lafayette pants and chapeau for the head dress. The cadets so distinguished themselves that the company was made a permanent organization of the college.Green, p. 39 However, the company was disbanded in 1856 when a riot between the students and the Columbia police almost descended into bloodshed. After John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, the students unsuccessfully petitioned for the reorganization of the cadet company. As the secession movement picked up pace after the election of Abraham Lincoln in the fall of 1860, the Board of Trustees voted to allow the students to reorganize the cadet company on December 3, 1860. They were placed under the strict supervision of the faculty and were only able to be called out for service with the approval the college president. The first company organized in the spring of 1861 was composed of four officers, thirteen non-commissioned officers, and ninety privates. They were trained and drilled according to Hardee's tactics by the captain of the state arsenal, Hugh Smith Thompson. On April 12 with the outbreak of hostilities at Fort Sumter, the cadet company tendered its services to Governor Pickens. He accepted the unit as part of the militia and ordered the company to hold in Columbia. The students wanted to take part in the action in Charleston and felt that the holding order was meant to keep them away from the fight. The cadets disbanded their company and telegraphed Governor Pickens just before their train left for Charleston that they had reorganized a new company. They arrived in Charleston during the evening, received orders from General Beauregard, and spent the night at the Hibernian Hall. On the morning of April 13, the cadets boarded a tug boat bound for Sullivan's Island. While en route, Major Anderson and the Union garrison fired upon the cadets on the boat, although no one was hit. The cadets were quartered at Fort Moultrie and their duty was to guard against a possible amphibious assault by the Union army. At the end of three weeks, the cadets received orders to return to Columbia to resume their classes. During the latter part of June, the students reformed the cadet company to volunteer for service in Virginia. They chose the college's professor of mathematics and native of Virginia, Charles Scott Venable, to lead the company. Nevertheless, Governor Pickens denied the students permission to join the fight in Virginia stating that \\"the war would be of short duration and that the Government needed statesmen more than soldiers.\\"Green, p. 369 The governor also felt that the students would be better served if they were scattered about rather than in one compact body. The cadet company disbanded and many left the college to volunteer for service in the Confederate Army. The Union victory at the Battle of Port Royal alarmed the students since a great number came from the Lowcountry. On November 8, the cadet company offered their services to Governor Pickens for coastal defense. The same day, they proceeded to Charleston before heading to Port Royal to report to General Drayton. However, once in Charleston, the students were detained by the governor to act as his bodyguard. Governor Pickens ordered the cadet company to be mustered out of service on December 10 after a lack of Union activity in South Carolina. Rather than head back to college, most of the students enlisted in the army and the college was eventually forced to close on March 8, 1862 due to lack of students.

It involved the infiltration by Swedish feminists of University of London medical lectures; pitched battles between medical students and the police; police protection for the statue of a dog; a libel trial at the Royal Courts of Justice; and the establishment of a Royal Commission to investigate the use of animals in experiments. The affair became a cause c√©l√®bre that divided the country.; . The controversy was triggered by allegations that, in February 1903, William Bayliss of the Department of Physiology at University College London performed an illegal vivisection, before an audience of 60 medical students, on a brown terrier dog‚Äîadequately anaesthetized, according to Bayliss and his team; conscious and struggling, according to the Swedish activists. The procedure was condemned as cruel and unlawful by the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Outraged by the assault on his reputation, Bayliss, whose research on dogs led to the discovery of hormones, sued for libel and won. Anti-vivisectionists commissioned a bronze statue of the dog as a memorial, unveiled on the Latchmere Recreation Ground in Battersea in 1906, but medical students were angered by its provocative plaque‚Äî\\"Men and women of England, how long shall these Things be?\\"‚Äîleading to frequent vandalism of the memorial and the need for a 24-hour police guard against the so-called anti-doggers.; . On 10 December 1907, hundreds of medical students marched through central London waving effigies of the brown dog on sticks, clashing with suffragettes, trade unionists and 300 police officers, one of a series of battles known as the Brown Dog riots.; . In March 1910, tired of the controversy, Battersea Council sent four workers accompanied by 120 police officers to remove the statue under cover of darkness, after which it was reportedly melted down by the council's blacksmith, despite a 20,000-strong petition in its favour. A new statue of the brown dog, commissioned by anti-vivisection groups, was erected in Battersea Park in 1985. Background =Cruelty to Animals Act 1876= There was significant opposition to vivisection in England, in both houses of Parliament, during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837‚Äì1901); the Queen herself strongly opposed it.; . The term vivisection referred to the dissection of living animals, with and without anaesthesia, often in front of audiences of medical students. In 1878 there were under 300 experiments on animals in the UK, a figure that had risen to 19,084 in 1903 when the brown dog was vivisected (according to the inscription on the second Brown Dog statue), and to five million by 1970.For 1878 and 1970: ; for 1903: \\"Monument to the Little Brown Dog, Battersea Park\\", Public Monument and Sculpture Association's National Recording Project. Physiologists in the 19th century were frequently criticized for their work. The prominent French physiologist Claude Bernard appears to have shared the distaste of his critics, who included his wife, referring to \\"the science of life\\" as a \\"superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen\\". In 1875 Irish feminist Frances Power Cobbe founded the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) in London and in 1898 the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV). The former sought to restrict vivisection and the latter to abolish it. The opposition led the British government, in July 1875, to set up the first Royal Commission on the \\"Practice of Subjecting Live Animals to Experiments for Scientific Purposes\\".; . After hearing that researchers did not use anaesthesia regularly‚Äîone scientist, Emmanuel Klein told the commission he had \\"no regard at all\\" for the suffering of the animals‚Äîthe commission recommended a series of measures, including a ban on experiments on dogs, cats, horses, donkeys and mules. The General Medical Council and British Medical Journal objected, so additional protection was introduced instead.; for Klein, see . The result was the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, criticized by NAVS as \\"infamous but well-named\\".; . \\"An Act to amend the Law relating to Cruelty to Animals (15th August 1876)\\", archive.org. The Act stipulated that researchers could not be prosecuted for cruelty, but that the animal must be anaesthetized, unless the anaesthesia would interfere with the point of the experiment. Each animal could be used only once, although several procedures regarded as part of the same experiment were permitted. The animal had to be killed when the study was over, unless doing so would frustrate the object of the experiment. Prosecutions could take place only with the approval of the Home Secretary. At the time of the Brown Dog affair this was Aretas Akers- Douglas, who was unsympathetic to the anti-vivisectionist cause. =Ernest Starling and William Bayliss= In the early 20th century, Ernest Starling, Professor of Physiology at University College London, and his brother-in-law William Bayliss, were using vivisection on dogs to determine whether the nervous system controls pancreatic secretions, as postulated by Ivan Pavlov. Bayliss had held a licence to practice vivisection since 1890 and had taught physiology since 1900. According to Starling's biographer John Henderson, Starling and Bayliss were \\"compulsive experimenters\\", and Starling's lab was the busiest in London. The men knew that the pancreas produces digestive juices in response to increased acidity in the duodenum and jejunum, because of the arrival of chyme there. By severing the duodenal and jejunal nerves in anaesthetized dogs, while leaving the blood vessels intact, then introducing acid into the duodenum and jejunum, they discovered that the process is not mediated by a nervous response, but by a new type of chemical reflex. They named the chemical messenger secretin, because it is secreted by the intestinal lining into the bloodstream, stimulating the pancreas on circulation. In 1905 Starling coined the term hormone‚Äîfrom the Greek hormao meaning \\"I arouse\\" or \\"I excite\\"‚Äîto describe chemicals such as secretin that are capable, in extremely small quantities, of stimulating organs from a distance. Bayliss and Starling had also used vivisection on anaesthetized dogs to discover peristalsis in 1899. They went on to discover a variety of other important physiological phenomena and principles, many of which were based on their experimental work involving animal vivisection.; for peristalsis, ; also see . \\"Ernest Henry Starling\\" and \\"Sir William Maddock Bayliss\\".

In 1900 the women visited the Pasteur Institute in Paris, a centre of animal experimentation, and were shocked by the rooms full of caged animals given diseases by the researchers. When they returned home, they founded the Anti-Vivisection Society of Sweden, and to gain medical training to help their campaigning, they enrolled in 1902 at the London School of Medicine for Women, a vivisection-free college that had visiting arrangements with other colleges. They attended 100 lectures and demonstrations at King's and University College, including 50 experiments on live animals, of which 20 were what Mason called \\"full-scale vivisection\\". Their diary, at first called Eye-Witnesses, was later published as The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology (1903); shambles was a name for a slaughterhouse.; . The women were present when the brown dog was vivisected, and wrote a chapter about it entitled \\"Fun\\", referring to the laughter they said they heard in the lecture room during the procedure.; . The brown dog =Vivisection of the dog= According to Starling, the brown dog was \\"a small brown mongrel allied to a terrier with short roughish hair, about 14‚Äì15 lb [c. 6 kg] in weight\\". He was first used in a vivisection in December 1902 by Starling, who cut open his abdomen and ligated the pancreatic duct. For the next two months he lived in a cage, until Starling and Bayliss used him again for two procedures on 2 February 1903, the day the Swedish women were present.\\"The little brown dog\\". National Anti-Vivisection Society, accessed 12 December 2013. Outside the lecture room before the students arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again to inspect the results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure.; The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled. According to Bayliss, the dog had been given a morphine injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that the dog had been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, and that there was no smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.; ; . In front of around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with electricity for half an hour, but was unable to demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony, Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife. =Women's diary= On 14 April 1903 Lind af Hageby and Schartau showed their unpublished 200-page diary, published later that year as The Shambles of Science, to the barrister Stephen Coleridge, secretary of the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Coleridge was the son of John Duke Coleridge, former Lord Chief Justice of England, and great-grandson of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His attention was drawn to the account of the brown dog. The 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act forbade the use of an animal in more than one experiment, yet it appeared that the brown dog had been used by Starling to perform surgery on the pancreas, used again by him when he opened the dog to inspect the results of the previous surgery, and used for a third time by Bayliss to study the salivary glands.; . The diary said of the procedures on the brown dog: > Today's lecture will include a repetition of a demonstration which failed > last time. A large dog, stretched on its back on an operation board, is > carried into the lecture-room by the demonstrator and the laboratory > attendant. Its legs are fixed to the board, its head is firmly held in the > usual manner, and it is tightly muzzled. There is a large incision in the > side of the neck, exposing the gland. The animal exhibits all signs of > intense suffering; in his struggles, he again and again lifts his body from > the board, and makes powerful attempts to get free. The allegations of repeated use and inadequate anaesthesia represented prima facie violations of the Cruelty to Animals Act. In addition the diary said the dog had been killed by Henry Dale, an unlicensed research student, and that the students had laughed during the procedure; there were \\"jokes and laughter everywhere\\" in the lecture hall, it said. =Stephen Coleridge's speech= Stephen Coleridge According to Mason, Coleridge decided there was no point in relying on a prosecution under the Act, which he regarded as deliberately obstructive. Instead he gave an angry speech about the dog on 1 May 1903 to the annual meeting of the National Anti-Vivisection Society at St James's Hall in Piccadilly, attended by 2,000‚Äì3,000 people. Mason writes that support and apologies for absence were sent by Jerome K. Jerome, Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling. Coleridge accused the scientists of torture: \\"If this is not torture, let Mr. Bayliss and his friends ... tell us in Heaven's name what torture is.\\"; . Details of the speech were published the next day by the radical Daily News (founded in 1846 by Charles Dickens), and questions were raised in the House of Commons, particularly by Sir Frederick Banbury, a Conservative MP and sponsor of a bill aimed at ending vivisection demonstrations. Banbury asked the Home Secretary to state \\"under what certificate the operation on a brown dog was performed at University College Hospital on Feb. 2 last; and, whether, seeing that a second operation was performed upon this animal before the wounds caused by the first operation had healed, he proposes to take any action in the matter.\\"\\"Vivisection at University College, London\\". The Observer. 10 May 1903. p. 6. Bayliss demanded a public apology from Coleridge, and when by 12 May it had failed to materialize he issued a writ for libel. Ernest Starling decided not to sue; The Lancet, no friend of Coleridge, wrote that \\"it may be contended that Dr. Starling and Mr. Bayliss committed a technical infringement of the Act under which they performed their experiments.\\" Coleridge tried to persuade the women not to publish their diary before the trial began, but they went ahead anyway, and it was published by Ernest Bell of Covent Garden in July 1903.; . Bayliss v. Coleridge =Trial= The Daily Graphic, November 1903. Starling is in the lower right corner; Bayliss, holding equipment, is in the centre. The trial opened at the Old Bailey on 11 November 1903 before Lord Alverstone, the Lord Chief Justice, and lasted four days, closing on 18 November. There were queues 30 yards long outside the courthouse. Bayliss's barrister, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as his first witness. Starling admitted that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. The tubes were fragile, he said, and had the dog been struggling they would have broken. A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, said the system Bayliss was using was unlikely to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; there was even a claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. According to Bayliss, the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement reported by Lind af Hageby and Schartau had not been not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, testified that the dog had seemed unconscious. Coleridge's barrister, John Lawson Walton, called Lind af Hageby and Schartau. They repeated they had been the first students to arrive and had been left alone with the dog for about two minutes. They had observed scars from the previous operations and an incision in the neck where two tubes had been placed. They had not smelled the anaesthetic and had not seen any apparatus delivering it. They said, Mason wrote, that the dog had arched his back and jerked his legs in what they regarded as an effort to escape. When the experiment began the dog continued to \\"upheave its abdomen\\" and tremble, they said, movements they regarded as \\"violent and purposeful\\". Bayliss's lawyer criticized Coleridge for having accepted the women's statements without seeking corroboration, and for speaking about the issue publicly without first approaching Bayliss, despite knowing that doing so could lead to litigation. Coleridge replied that he had not sought verification because he knew the claims would be denied, and that he continued to regard the women's statement as true. The Times wrote of his testimony: \\"The Defendant, when placed in the witness box, did as much damage to his own case as the time at his disposal for the purpose would allow.\\" =Verdict= Lord Alverstone, the Lord Chief Justice. Lord Alverstone told the jury that the case was an important one of national interest. He called The Shambles of Science \\"hysterical\\" and advised the jury not to be swayed by arguments about the validity of vivisection. After retiring for 25 minutes on 18 November 1903, the jury unanimously found that Bayliss had been defamed, to the applause of physicians in the public gallery. Bayliss was awarded ¬£2,000 with ¬£3,000 costs; Coleridge gave him a cheque the next day. The Daily News asked for donations to cover Coleridge's costs and raised ¬£5,700 within four months. Bayliss donated his damages to UCL for use in research; according to Mason, Bayliss ignored the Daily Mails suggestion that he call it the \\"Stephen Coleridge Vivisection Fund\\". Gratzer wrote in 2004 that the fund may still have been in use then to buy animals. The Times declared itself satisfied with the verdict, although it criticized the rowdy behaviour of medical students during the trial, accusing them of \\"medical hooliganism\\". The Sun, Star and Daily News backed Coleridge, calling the decision a miscarriage of justice. Ernest Bell, publisher of The Shambles of Science, apologized to Bayliss on 25 November, and pledged to withdraw the diary and pass its remaining copies to Bayliss's solicitors.. The Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society, founded by Lind af Hageby in 1903, republished the book, printing a fifth edition by 1913. The chapter \\"Fun\\" was replaced by one called \\"The Vivisections of the Brown Dog\\", describing the experiment and the trial.\\"The Brown Dog\\", NAVS. The novelist Thomas Hardy kept a copy of the book on a table for visitors; he told a correspondent that he had \\"not really read [it], but everybody who comes into this room, where it lies on my table, dips into it, etc, and, I hope, profits something\\". According to historian Hilda Kean, the Research Defence Society, a lobby group founded in 1908 to counteract the antivivisectionist campaign, discussed how to have the revised editions withdrawn because of the book's impact. In December 1903 Mark Twain, who opposed vivisection, published a short story, A Dog's Tale, in Harper's, written from the point of view of a dog whose puppy is experimented on and killed. Given the timing and Twain's views, the story may have been inspired by the libel trial, according to Mark Twain scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin. Coleridge ordered 3,000 copies of A Dog's Tale, which were specially printed for him by Harper's. Second Royal Commission on Vivisection On 17 September 1906, the government appointed the Second Royal Commission on Vivisection, which heard evidence from scientists and anti- vivisection groups; Ernest Starling addressed the commission for three days in December 1906.; . After much delay (two of its ten members died and several fell ill), the commission reported its findings in March 1912.; ; . Its 139-page report recommended an increase in the number of full-time inspectors from two to four, and restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments. The Commission decided that animals should be adequately anaesthetized, and euthanized if the pain was likely to continue, and experiments should not be performed \\"as an illustration of lectures\\" in medical schools and similar. All the restrictions could be lifted if they would \\"frustrate the object of the experiment\\". There was also a tightening of the definition and practice of pithing. The Commission recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.; . Brown Dog memorial After the trial Anna Louisa Woodward, founder of the World League Against Vivisection, raised ¬£120 for a public memorial and commissioned a bronze statue of the dog from sculptor Joseph Whitehead. The statue sat on top of a granite memorial stone, 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m) tall, that housed a drinking fountain for human beings and a lower trough for dogs and horses. It also carried an inscription (right), described by The New York Times in 1910 as the \\"hysterical language customary of anti-vivisectionists\\" and \\"a slander on the whole medical profession\\". The group turned to the borough of Battersea for a location for the memorial. Lansbury wrote that the area was a hotbed of radicalism‚Äîproletarian, socialist, full of belching smoke and slums, and closely associated with the anti-vivisection movement. The National Anti- Vivisection and Battersea General Hospital‚Äîopened in 1896, on the corner of Albert Bridge Road and Prince of Wales Drive, and closed in 1972‚Äîrefused until 1935 to perform vivisection or employ doctors who engaged in it, and was known locally as the \\"antiviv\\" or the \\"old anti\\".; . The chairman of the Battersea Dogs Home, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland, rejected a request in 1907 that its lost dogs be sold to vivisectors as \\"not only horrible, but absurd\\". Battersea council agreed to provide space for the statue on its Latchmere Recreation Ground, part of the council's new Latchmere Estate, which offered terraced homes to rent for seven and sixpence a week.; \\"Latchmere Recreation Ground Park Management Plan 2008\\" , Wandsworth Borough Council, 3, 6. The statue was unveiled on 15 September 1906 in front of a large crowd, with speakers that included George Bernard Shaw, the Irish feminist Charlotte Despard, the mayor of Battersea, James H. Brown (secretary of the Battersea Trades and Labour Council), and the Reverend Charles Noel.; .\\"Monument to a Dog: Antivivisectionist Memorial Unveiled at Battersea\\". The Observer. 16 September 1906, 5. Riots =November‚ÄìDecember 1907= The old Brown Dog by Joseph Whitehead Medical students at London's teaching hospitals were enraged by the plaque. The first year of the statue's existence was a quiet one, while University College explored whether they could take legal action over it, but from November 1907 the students turned Battersea into the scene of frequent disruption. The first action was on 20 November, when undergraduate William Howard Lister led a group of medical students across the Thames to Battersea to attack the statue with a crowbar and sledgehammer. One of them, Duncan Jones, hit the statue with a hammer, denting it, at which point all ten were arrested by just two police officers.; .\\"Medical students fined\\". The Times. 22 November 1907, 13. According to Mason, a local doctor told the South Western Star that this signalled the \\"utter degeneration\\" of junior doctors: \\"I can remember the time when it was more than 10 policemen could do to take one student. The Anglo-Saxon race is played out.\\" The students were fined ¬£5 by the magistrate, Paul Taylor, at South-West London Police Court in Battersea and warned they would be jailed next time. This triggered another protest two days later, when medical students from UCL, King's, Guy's, and the West Middlesex hospitals marched along the Strand toward King's College, waving miniature brown dogs on sticks and a life-sized effigy of the magistrate, and singing, \\"Let's hang Paul Taylor on a sour apple tree / As we go marching on.\\"; .\\"Indignant students: The Memorial to the Brown Dog\\". The Manchester Guardian. 26 November 1907, 4. The Times reported that they tried to burn the effigy but, unable to light it, threw it in the Thames instead. Women's suffrage meetings were invaded, although the students knew that not all suffragettes were anti-vivisectionists. A meeting organized by Millicent Fawcett on 5 December 1907 at the Paddington Baths Hall in Bayswater was left with chairs and tables smashed and one steward with a torn ear. Two fireworks were let off, and Fawcett's speech was drowned out by students singing John Brown's Body, after which they marched down Queen's Road led by someone with bagpipes. The Daily Express reported the meeting as \\"Medical Students' Gallant Fight with Women\\".; .\\"Students and Woman Suffrage\\". The Times. 6 December 1907. Issue 38509, 8. =10 December 1907= The rioting reached its height five days later, on Tuesday, 10 December, when 100 medical students tried to pull the memorial down. The previous protests had been spontaneous, but this one was organized to coincide with the annual Oxford- Cambridge rugby match at Queen's Club, West Kensington. The protesters hoped (in vain, as it turned out) that some of the thousands of Oxbridge students would swell their numbers. The intention was that, after toppling the statue and throwing it in the Thames, 2,000‚Äì3,000 students would meet at 11:30 pm in Trafalgar Square. Street vendors sold handkerchiefs stamped with the date of the protest and the words, \\"Brown Dog's inscription is a lie, and the statuette an insult to the London University.\\" In the afternoon protesters headed for the statue, but were driven off by locals. The students proceeded down Battersea Park Road instead, intending to attack the Anti-Vivisection Hospital, but were again forced back. When one student fell from the top of a tram, the workers shouted that it was \\"the brown dog's revenge\\" and refused to take him to hospital.; . The British Medical Journal responded that, given that it was the Anti-Vivisection Hospital, the crowd's actions may have been \\"prompted by benevolence\\". A second group of students headed for central London, waving effigies of the brown dog, joined by a police escort and, briefly, a busker with bagpipes. As the marchers reached Trafalgar Square, they were 400 strong, facing 200‚Äì300 police officers, 15 of them on horseback. The students gathered around Nelson's Column, where the ringleaders climbed onto its base to make speeches. While students fought with police on the ground, mounted police charged the crowd, scattering them into smaller groups and arresting the stragglers, including one undergraduate, Alexander Bowley, who was arrested for \\"barking like a dog\\". The fighting continued for hours before the police gained control. At Bow Street magistrate's court the next day, ten students were bound over to keep the peace; several were fined 40 shillings, or ¬£3 if they had fought with police.\\"The Police Courts: Student demonstration\\". The Times. 12 December 1907. Issue 38514, 15. \\"Brown Dog Riots\\". Los Angeles Times. 31 December 1904, 7; . =Strange relationships= Students let off stink bombs at a Brown Dog meeting, December 1906 Rioting broke out elsewhere over the following days and months, as medical and veterinary students united. Whenever Lizzy Lind af Hageby spoke, students would shout her down. When she arranged a meeting of the Ealing and Acton Anti-Vivisection Society at Acton Central Hall on 11 December 1906, over 100 students disrupted it, throwing chairs and stink bombs, particularly when she objected to a student blowing her a kiss. The Daily Chronicle reported: \\"The rest of Miss Lind-af-Hageby's indignation was lost in a beautiful 'eggy' atmosphere that was now rolling heavily across the hall. 'Change your socks!' shouted one of the students.\\" Furniture was smashed and clothing torn. For Susan McHugh of the University of New England, the political coalition of trade unionists, socialists, Marxists, liberals and suffragettes that rallied to the statue's defence reflected the brown dog's mongrel status. The riots saw them descend on Battersea to fight the medical students, even though, she writes, the suffragettes were not a group toward whom male workers felt any warmth. But the \\"Brown Terrier Dog Done to Death\\" by the male scientific establishment united them all. Lizzy Lind af-Hageby and Charlotte Despard saw the affair as a battle between feminism and machismo.; . According to Coral Lansbury, the fight for women's suffrage became closely linked with the anti- vivisection movement, and the iconography of vivisection struck a chord with women. Three of the four vice-presidents of the National Anti-Vivisection Hospital were women. Lansbury argues that the Brown Dog affair became a matter of opposing symbols: the vivisected dog on the operating board blurred into images of suffragettes force-fed in Brixton Prison, or women strapped down for childbirth or forced to have their ovaries and uteruses removed as a cure for \\"mania\\". The \\"vivisected animal stood for vivisected woman\\". Both sides saw themselves as heirs to the future. Hilda Kean writes that the Swedish activists were young and female, anti-establishment and progressive, and viewed the scientists as remnants of a previous age. Their access to higher education had made the case possible, creating what feminist scholar Susan Hamilton called a \\"new form of witnessing\\". Against this, Lansbury writes, the students saw themselves and their teachers as the \\"New Priesthood\\" and the women and trade unionists as representatives of superstition and sentimentality. =\\"Exit the 'Brown Dog'\\"= The Daily Graphic, 11 March 1910, shows the empty spot where the Brown Dog had stood. Questions were asked in the House of Commons about the cost of policing the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of ¬£700 a year. In February 1908 Sir Philip Magnus, MP for the London University constituency, asked the Home Secretary, Herbert Gladstone, \\"whether his attention has been called to the special expense of police protection of a public monument at Battersea that bears a controversial inscription\\". Gladstone replied that six constables were needed daily to protect the statue, and that the overall cost of extra policing had been equivalent to employing 27 inspectors, 55 sergeants, and 1,083 constables for a day.\\"Vivisection‚ÄîThe Battersea Brown Dog\\". Hansard. Volume 183. 6 February 1908. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to the cost. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London,\\"John Archer honoured by High Commission of Barbados\\", Wandsworth Borough Council, 7 April 2017. told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying ¬£22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves. Other councillors suggested the statue be encased in a steel cage and surrounded by a barbed wire fence. Suggestions were made through the letters pages of the Times and elsewhere that it be moved, perhaps to the grounds of the Anti-Vivisection Hospital. The British Medical Journal wrote in March 1910: > May we suggest that the most appropriate resting place for the rejected work > of art is the Home for Lost Dogs at Battersea, where it could be \\"done to > death\\", as the inscription says, with a hammer in the presence of Miss > Woodword, the Rev. Lionel S. Lewis, and other friends; if their feelings > were too much for them, doubtless an anaesthetic could be administered. Demonstration on 19 March 1910, Trafalgar Square, to protest the statue's removal. Battersea Council grew tired of the controversy. A new Conservative council was elected in November 1909 amid talk of removing the statue. There were protests in support of it, and the 500-strong Brown Dog memorial defence committee was established. Twenty thousand people signed a petition, and 1,500 attended a rally in February 1910 addressed by Lind af Hageby, Charlotte Despard and Liberal MP George Greenwood. There were more demonstrations in central London and speeches in Hyde Park, with supporters wearing masks of dogs. The protests were to no avail. The statue was quietly removed before dawn on 10 March 1910 by four council workmen, accompanied by 120 police officers. Nine days later, 3,000 anti-vivisectionists gathered in Trafalgar Square to demand its return, but it was clear by then that Battersea Council had turned its back on the affair.Daily Graphic, 11 March 1910, cited in Kean 2003, 364‚Äì365; . The statue was at first hidden in the borough surveyor's bicycle shed, according to a letter his daughter wrote in 1956 to the British Medical Journal, then reportedly destroyed by a council blacksmith, who melted it down.; . Anti-vivisectionists filed a High Court petition demanding its return, but the case was dismissed in January 1911. New memorial The new Brown Dog by Nicola Hicks On 12 December 1985, over 75 years after the statue's removal, a new memorial to the brown dog was unveiled by actress Geraldine James in Battersea Park behind the Pump House. Created by sculptor Nicola Hicks and commissioned by the National Anti-Vivisection Society and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, the new bronze dog is mounted on a Portland stone plinth and based on Hicks's own terrier, Brock. Peter Mason described it as \\"a coquettish contrast to its down-to-earth predecessor\\".\\"Monument to the Little Brown Dog, Battersea Park\\", Public Monument and Sculpture Association's National Recording Project; . In a direct echo of the past, the British Medical Journal (Clinical Research Edition) published an editorial on 8 March 1986 condemning, in no uncertain terms, the \\"New Antivivisectionist Libellous Statue At Battersea\\", and the Greater London Council for enablng it; and recounted as uncontestable fact the medical practitioner view of the original brown dog's vivisections. Echoing the fate of the previous memorial, the new dog was moved into storage in 1992 by Battersea Park's owners, the Conservative Borough of Wandsworth, they said as part of a park renovation scheme. Anti-vivisectionists campaigned for its return, suspicious of the explanation. It was reinstated in the park's Woodland Walk in 1994, near the Old English Garden, a more secluded spot than before. The new statue was criticized in 2003 by historian Hilda Kean. She saw the old Brown Dog as a radical statement, upright and defiant: \\"The dog has changed from a public image of defiance to a pet\\". For Kean, the new Brown Dog, located near the Old English Garden as \\"heritage\\", is too safe; unlike its controversial ancestor, she argues, it makes no one uncomfortable. Miscellaneous A BBC Radio 4 play about the Brown Dog affair was broadcast in 1999.

In addition, he sat on the Colorado Water Congress Policy Committee, the Logan County Planning Commission and was on the boards of the Colorado Farm Bureau and the Republican River Conservation District. Sonnenberg also worked in education, substitute teaching in Sterling Public Schools, in addition to teaching in the Farm Business Management Department at Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, Colorado. He served as chairman for the Colorado Preschool Pilot Program and was on the Sterling Schools Building Accountability Committee. His leadership expanded into sports, where he was on the board of the Sterling Baseball Organization, and coached and umpired Colorado high school baseball, among other sports. Sonnenberg also worked as the director of music ministry at Sterling's First Christian Church and was choir director at Sterling's Berean Church. Legislative career A former precinct chairman for the Logan County Republican Party, Sonnenberg ran unopposed and won the Colorado legislature in 2006. or the general election. =2006 election= Out of 24 first-term house members elected in 2006 -- the largest freshman class since Colorado statehood -- Sonnenberg was the only one elected without any electoral opposition. =2007 legislative session= During the 2007 legislative session, Sonnenberg sat on the House Agriculture, Livestock and Natural Resources Committee and the House Transportation and Energy Committee. During his first term, Sonnenberg was also appointed to the state's Correctional Industries Advisory Committee. Sonnenberg's top-priority legislation during the 2007 session of the Colorado General Assembly was a bill restricting the ability of Colorado governments to obtain water rights through eminent domain. The bill was denounced as unconstitutional by the Colorado League of Municipalities, and only narrowly passed the state house. Senate sponsor Brandon Shaffer modified the Senate version of the bill, which passed by a wide margin, to call only for a study on the issue; Sonnenberg publicly called Shaffer a \\"turncoat\\" for amending the Senate bill and then refusing to call for a conference committee to reconcile the two versions of the legislation. Sonnenberg intends to introduce the legislation again during the 2008 session. Sonnenberg also sponsored legislation to allow state inspectors to inspect livestock records in order to prevent the spread of mad cow disease, and to increase funding for rural district attorneys. After the 2007 legislative session, Sonnenberg was recognized by the Colorado Union of Taxpayers as one of its \\"Outstanding Legislators of 2007\\" for his support of lower taxes and private property rights Sonnenberg also sits on two interim committees -- on transportation and on allocation of severance tax and federal mineral lease revenues. =2008 legislative session= In the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Sonnenberg sits on the House Agriculture, Livestock, & Natural Resources Committee and the House Transportation and Energy Committee. For the 2008 session, Sonnenberg sponsored legislation to limit the power of the Colorado Department of Wildlife to purchase land, by requiring that any purchase be matched by a sale of other assets of equal value. The bill was opposed by the Department of Wildlife, and failed to pass a House committee. Sonnenberg did credit the measure, however, with leading to the DOW's formation of a landowners‚Äô advisory group and a meeting with the DOW and landowners in northeastern Colorado. Sonnenberg also introduced legislation to allow special districts in Colorado to retain tax revenue that otherwise would have been diverted because of tax increment financing; the bill also died in committee. Other bills, to create a sales tax holiday for school supplies and to enhance funding for special districts that provide emergency services, also died in committee. Sonnenberg also introduced a bill, authored by students from Sterling High School, to except school fundraisers from sales tax. The bill was killed in committee, but later revived by House Democrats after pressure from Sonnenberg. A similar but narrower measure was introduced by Rep. Joe Rice, and the two legislators agreed to work to reconcile the two bills. Ultimately, Sonnenberg's measure was passed by the legislature, with Sterling High School students testifying in support of it, and was signed into by Gov. Ritter. During debate on the state budget, Sonnenberg offered an unsuccessful amendment, mirroring one of his defeated 2007 bills, to increase funding for rural district attorneys offices; he also unsuccessfully attempted to eliminate 21 jobs within the Oil and Gas Commission created to monitor compliance with new environmental rules, arguing that the positions should have been attached to the original 2007 legislation that enacted the new rules. During the session, Sonnenberg sponsored 11 bills, of which seven passed. Following the session, he expressed concern over the legislature's failure to provide addition transportation funding and announced his intention to introduce legislation providing additional funding for road repair and water storage in the 2009 legislative session. =2008 campaign= In February 2008, Sonnenberg announced his bid for re-election to a second two-year term in the state house. He faced only unaffiliated write-in candidate Dan Conn in the general election. Sonnenberg emphasized water, infrastructure, and rural development issues during his campaign. Sonnenberg's re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, the Sterling Journal- Advocate, and the Windsor Beacon. Facing only a write-in opponent, Sonnenberg received 98.6% of the votes cast to win a second term. =2009 legislative session= For the 2009 legislative session, Sonnenberg was named to seats on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Agriculture, Livestock, and Natural Resources Committee. Sonnenberg plans on sponsoring legislation regarding urban renewal authorities, and legislation mandating reparations from the Colorado Division of Wildlife for game damage to agricultural land, a proposal which was weakened in House committee. Sonnenberg also proposed legislation to allocate a portion of sales tax revenue directly to transportation; his legislation was a major portion of Republicans' alternative proposals to a registration fee increase proposed by Democrats. Sonnenberg sponsored legislation to allow betting on \\"historic\\" horse races at three locations statewide; his bill was killed in favor of an alternative proposal to expand simulcast betting. Sonnenberg also introduced a bill to allow heavier trucks on Colorado roadways, arguing it would increase transportation efficiency for farmers. Sonnenberg was also a vocal opponent of new rules on oil and gas drilling passed by the legislature. Following the legislative session, the Colorado Union of Taxpayers named Sonnenberg a \\"Taxpayer Guardian;\\" his 90 percent rating on their legislative scorecard identified him as one of the most fiscally conservative legislators in the state. =2010 legislative session= =2010 campaign= =2011 legislative session= =2012 legislative session= =2012 campaign= In the 2012 General Election, Representative Sonnenberg was again unchallenged in his bid for a fourth term in the Colorado House. Unsurprisingly, Sonnenberg was declared the winner with 100% of votes cast in his favor. =2013 legislative session= =2014 legislative session= =2014 campaign= In 2014, Rep. Sonnenberg chose to run for State Senate District 1. =2015 legislative session= =2017 legislative session= In November 2016, Sonnenberg was elected Senate President Pro Tempore. =2018 Legislative Session= In 2018, Senator Sonnenberg, President Pro Tempore of the Colorado Senate, continued to serve on several committees including Legislative Council, Appropriations, State Affairs and as Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee where he draws upon his experience as a farmer/rancher. Among the bills he sponsored that were signed into law by the Governor is Senate Bill 123 which is designed to create more transparency within asbestos claims proceedings. He also sponsored a bill, Senate Bill 33, that extends the repeal date for the Department of Public Health and Environment‚Äôs animal feeding operation permit program into 2025. The Second bill introduced in the Senate in 2018 was Senate Bill 2, which allocated funding for broadband development in rural areas of the state.

Ranald MacDougall's screenplay, based on the unproduced play Feature for June by Eileen Tighe and Graeme Lorimer, was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Comedy. The film starred Bette Davis and Robert Montgomery. The Warner Bros. release marked the screen debut of Debbie Reynolds, although her appearance was uncredited. Plot Foreign correspondent Carey Jackson (Robert Montgomery) returns to New York City when his newspaper's Vienna office is closed and is offered a job on a women's magazine called Home Life. He accepts the position only because it will put him in daily contact with editor Linda Gilman (Bette Davis), whom he once loved. Linda is averse to the idea because of his leaving her three years earlier, but agrees to hire him if he will keep their relationship on a strictly professional level. The two head for the Brinker home in Crestville, Indiana, to prepare a feature story about eldest daughter Jeanne's (Barbara Bates) wedding to Bud Mitchell (Raymond Roe) for the June issue. Linda wants Carey to write a simple story about the young couple, but he insists on looking for an angle, which presents itself in the form of Jeanne's younger sister Barbara (nicknamed \\"Boo\\") (Betty Lynn), who confesses she always has been in love with Bud, the brother of Jeanne's former beau Jim (Ray Montgomery), who was dumped by Jeanne when he joined the Army. At first Carey proposes they ask an officer he knows to order Jim home for the wedding, but thinks better of it, knowing he will lose his job if the wedding plans are disrupted. Boo, however, secretly telephones Carey's friend and arranges a leave for Jim. Complications ensue when Jim arrives home and Carey tries to get rid of him while Linda, unaware of the reality of the situation, intervenes and makes him stay. Jim and Jeanne elope, Linda fires Carey, Carey feigns interest in Boo to make Bud jealous, and the scheme succeeds, with Bud proposing to Boo. Despite losing his job, Carey writes his story, Linda realizes he always knew the truth about the couples, and the two reconcile. Cast * Bette Davis as Linda Gilman * Robert Montgomery as Carey Jackson * Fay Bainter as Paula Winthrop * Betty Lynn as Barbara (\\"Boo\\") Brinker * Tom Tully as Whitman Brinker * Barbara Bates as Jeanne Brinker * Jerome Cowan as Carleton Towne * Mary Wickes as Rosemary McNally * Raymond Roe as Bud Mitchell * Ray Montgomery as Jim Mitchell Production Paramount Pictures also considered producing a film version of Tighe and Lorimer's play which Tighe, the editor of House and Garden, had considered adapting into a stage musical. Bette Davis wanted either Dennis Morgan or Jack Carson for her co-star, but director Windust and producer Henry Blanke convinced her to accept Robert Montgomery as her leading man, arguing he had a larger fan base. Blanke later admitted they believed the mid-forties Montgomery would make 40-year-old Davis look younger, but after watching the rushes, he realized the casting achieved the opposite effect, with Davis making Montgomery look younger. June Bride was filmed during the 1948 Presidential campaign. A line of dialogue delivered by Mary Wickes, referring to the refurbishment the old-fashioned Brinker home, a dowdy house crammed full of Victoriana kitsch, desperately needed, was filmed twice, once as \\"How can I convert this McKinley stinker into a Dewey modern?\\" and the second time with the name Truman substituted for Dewey. When the film opened in New York City in late October, Dewey seemed a sure win, so the Dewey line was retained. When Truman unexpectedly won the election, a revised reel was sent to theaters. Davis, a staunch Truman supporter, sent Montgomery, who had headed the Hollywood Republican Committee to elect Dewey, a gloating telegram. The film's success proved to be an oasis for Davis and Warner Brothers; her previous two pictures were box-office disappointments. It was the first comedy film Davis had made since 1941. In that year, she starred in two comedies: The Bride Came C.O.D. and The Man Who Came to Dinner. As a result, Davis was given a new, four-picture contract with a salary of $10,285 a week, making her the highest-paid woman in the United States at the time.June Bride at Turner Classic Movies June Bride was also reunion for Davis and two prominent cast members - Fay Bainter, who in 1938, along with Davis, won an Oscar for Jezebel, and Mary Wickes, who was featured in both The Man Who Came to Dinner in 1941 and Now Voyager in 1942. In addition, the two young actresses who played the Brinker sisters - Barbara Bates and Betty Lynn - were also cast in two future Bette Davis films. Although she had no scenes with Davis, Barbara Bates was memorably featured in the last scene of the classic 1950 Twentieth-Century-Fox Oscar-winning film All About Eve as Phoebe, a young ruthless, opportunistic actress very much like Eve Harrington (played by Anne Baxter). In 1951, Betty Lynn was cast as Davis's daughter in the RKO film Payment on Demand. June Bride was the penultimate Warner Brothers film for Bette Davis. In 1949, Davis made Beyond the Forest against her will and after the film was completed, she and Warner Brothers parted company after eighteen years. Davis reprised her role of Linda Gilman in an August 29, 1949, Lux Radio Theatre broadcast co-starring James Stewart as Carey Jackson. Irene Dunne and Fred MacMurray assumed the roles in a second Lux adaptation on December 28, 1953, and Marguerite Chapman and Jerome Thor starred in a Lux Video Theatre telecast on August 25, 1955.June Bride at Turner Classic Movies Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther described the film as \\"a delightful vehicle [and] a sophisticated thing, largely dependent for its humors upon a complex of wry attitudes...[It is] also a pretty solid story of good old home-town folks, never too soggy with sentiment and just a shade satiric around the edge...Maybe we owe our fullest tributes to Ranald MacDougall, who...has written some urbane dialogue which has more bounce and bubble in it than any we've recently heard. Maybe we owe Bretaigne Windust our particular votes of thanks for a fine job of volatile directing...Maybe we owe Miss Davis and Mr. Montgomery our special gratitude for playing a couple of smart worldlings with a lovely talent for the comic touch, for timing a line or a gesture to the micrometric dot...But this isn't a case where special mentions should be too specifically indulged. Everybody concerned does a grand job.\\"New York Times review Time wrote \\"Thanks largely to some bright dialogue and an artful performance by Robert Montgomery, this is the best Bette Davis picture in some time.\\"Time review Box office According to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,882,000 domestically and $552,000 foreign.

Biography Georg Brockhoff Quistgaard was born on 19 February 1915 in Peder Skramsgade 11-3, Copenhagen to Cand.polit., secretary at B√∏rsen Georg Brockhoff Quistgaard and wife Marie Bolette n√©e Breyen, and was baptized on 3 May 1915 in the Church of Holmen. His father had died before his birth, on 18 December 1914 at Rigshospitalet at the age of 40. In 1924 Quistgaard together with his mother and his older sister Bodil had moved to Sankt Mortensvej 6, Roskilde, the residence of his maternal grandmother Eleonora Isidora Wilhemine n√©e Nielsen widow after brewer in Roskilde Marius Henrik Gustav Emil Breyen. On Palm Sunday 1929 Quistgaard was confirmed in Roskilde Cathedral, still residing Sankt Mortensvej 6, Roskilde. The following year he lived at the same address with his mother, his older sister Bodil and a housekeeper. The mother had not remarried and worked as a county treasurer. As a youth, Quistgaard dropped out of high-school and travelled through Europe on foot and bicycle. In Paris, he met the two year younger Ellen Nielsen who was also from Copenhagen and they returned to Denmark. On 24 September 1938 he and Ellen married in Copenhagen City Hall, while residing D√∏nnerupvej 1, Vanl√∏se, he as an art dealer she as a secretary. They opened a small shop of art works in Copenhagen, which went out of business in 1940. In 1944 he and his wife had registered a phone as translators at the address Aabenraa 10, Copenhagen. Resistance The last page of his diaryThe first part of a letter to this mother, written on toilet paper During the occupation of Denmark, Quistgaard was connected to \\"Hjemmefronten\\" (the home front) og Special Operations Executive for whom he was a contact person and courier. He scouted for new airdrop sites, helped found the Hvidsten group as well as participating in their initial airdrop receptions. Quistgaard and his wife provided support for Special Operations Executive (SOE) operatives organized by British Intelligence. Additionally Quistgaard participated in the reception of allied airdropped weapons in the area of Gyldenl√∏ves H√∏j. On several occasions Quistgaard demanded (in vain) that one SOE operative, an Englishman who had parachuted into Denmark, should be returned as inadequate. During a subsequent interrogation of this operative by the Gestapo, he identified Quistgaard as being with the Resistance. On 13 January 1944 the Gestapo arrested Quistgaard in his home (Abenraa 10, Copenhagen) after an exchange of fire; they incarcerated him in Vestre F√¶ngsel. His wife was not at home and managed to escape to Sweden, a fact which the resistance later communicated to Quistgaard. The January 1944 issue of De frie Danske describes a drawn out firefight around 3 pm in the Copenhagen street Aabenraa between the Gestapo and Danish patriots. The newspaper learned that five people were arrested in a building there, after they ran out of ammunition. On 28 January 1944 the Gestapo arrested Quistgaard's mother. The interrogation by the Gestapo took place at their headquarters in Dagmarhus. Quistgaard's prison diary and letters to his wife and mother suggest that he did not feel he was subjected to torture, but rather that there was some element of mutual respect between him and his interrogators. Quistgaard's initial interrogation included sleep deprivation, including one 28-hour interrogation, and thinly veiled threats of being beaten with a rubber baton. This changed one day when his interrogator proclaimed: \\"It is up to you alone how long this woman has to remain here\\", after which the woman was revealed to be his mother. His mother was released after about two weeks of imprisonment. On 2 March 1944 Quistgaard was moved with eight others to Schwerin. On 25 April 1944 he was transferred back to Vestre F√¶ngsel. On 12 May 1944 Quistgaard was put on trial as one of twelve members of the resistance in front of three judges from the SS. As witnesses, the prosecution presented two SOE operatives, known as Jacob Jensen and Bent. The former incriminated eight of the twelve to the point where they admitted to the charges. Quistgaard along with two other men and Monica Wichfeld were condemned to death with the execution pending any new acts of sabotage. Two days later the four death sentences were published in the Danish newspapers. On the evening of 20 May 1944 Quistgaard wrote what was to be his last letter, to his mother. It was smuggled out the following day by J√∏rgen Kieler. On 20 or 21 May 1944 Quistgaard and the two other men condemned at the trial were executed. Monica Wichfeld had her sentence commuted to life imprisonment but died in German captivity before the end of the war. The news of the execution was published by the papers on 23 May. After his death On 14 June 1945 an inquest in the Department of Forensic Medicine of the university of Copenhagen showed that Quistgaard was executed with gunshot wounds to the chest. On 26 June a memorial service was held for Quistgaard in Grundtvig's Church and on 29 August he and 105 other victims of the occupation were given a state funeral in the memorial park founded at the execution site in Ryvangen. Bishop Hans Fuglsang-Damgaard led the service with participation from the royal family, the government and representatives of the resistance movement. In 1946 his prison diary and letters were published, prefaced by Elias Bredsdorff. The royalties from the book were donated to Frihedsfonden.

She was more commonly known as USRC Forward. Forward served with the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy in Mexican waters during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and was commended for her actions during the Tabasco River landings by Commodore Matthew C. Perry, U.S. Navy. After the war, she was transferred to the U.S. Coast Survey for a short time as USCS Walter Forward before being returned to the Revenue Marine for service during the 1850s and the American Civil War. Construction and commissioning The cutter Forward was built in Washington, D.C. at a cost of 3,786.75 by William Easby with construction was supervised by Captain Henry Prince, Revenue Marine.\\"And Other Duties as Assigned\\", Pickled Fish and Salted Provisions, p 5Noble, p 58 Prince apparently captained Forward from 23 April 1842 to 18 April 1843. Forward was a topsail schooner of conventional copper-sheathed wood-hull construction with no machinery on board, was long and had a displacement of 139 tons. She was designed to enforce customs laws and to assist mariners in distress. Forward was named for Walter P. Forward, 15th United States Secretary of the Treasury Early service Forward was commissioned 23 June 1842 and was initially assigned patrol duties at Baltimore, Maryland. On 18 April 1843, she exchanged crews with and was assigned a homeport of Wilmington, Delaware. On 16 May 1846 she received orders to report to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for repairs in preparation to being assigned duties with the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.Smith, p 75 Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War operations =Service with the U.S. Army= She set sail for the gulf on 23 May 1846 in company with another cutter, USRC Ewing, and arrived at Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on 19 June 1846. There, General Zachary Taylor ordered the ship to blockade a stretch of the Mexican coast near Soto la Marina and capture any ships engaged in trade with the enemy. The squadron that Forward was assigned to performed scouting, convoy, towing, and blockade duties as well transporting troops and supplies for the Army and occupied her during mid-summer 1846. =Service with the U.S. Navy= On 23 August 1846, she received orders to report to Commodore David Conner's naval squadron off Tampico, Mexico. Four days later, she entered the anchorage at Ant√≥n Lizardo and began patrolling off Tampico. That assignment lasted until 15 September 1846 when she received orders transferring her to the U.S. Navy under Commodore Conner at which time she moved farther down the coast to join the blockade of Veracruz.Record of Movements, p 99 In mid-October 1846, she joined a force commanded by Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry, U.S. Navy. On 15 October 1846, Perry's squadron attempted to cross the bar at the mouth of the river at Alvarado. The steamer led the way and succeeded in making her crossing, Forward followed, in tow of sister revenue cutter, . McLane grounded on the bar while the three ships she towed fouled each other's towlines. Vixen engaged the Mexican batteries on shore but, when it became apparent that McLane would never succeed in getting across the bar, she and her tows retired. Luckily, McLane came off the bar, and all American ships retired.King, p 133 On 16 October Forward set sail for a similar, but far more successful, amphibious operation at the mouth of the Tabasco River. Successfully navigating the bar on 23 October 1846, the force quickly seized the town of Frontera and took several prizes in the process. Forward and the other small steamers attached to Perry's force then continued the foray, sailing up the river through hostile territory to the town of Tabasco. Forward supplied part of her crew as a landing party along with Marines that were from USS Vixen and they captured the town of Tabasco.Evans, p 62 The flotilla seized 10 vessels as prizes before returning to the ocean on 26 October 1846.Record of Movements, p 101 However, Forward along with McLane remained at Frontera until late November 1846, engaged in the destruction of the captured Mexican shipping and maintaining a blockade of the river.Evans, p 63 She departed the area on 21 November 1846 and returned to the base at Anton Lizardo on 21 November 1846.Record of Movements, p 102 In December 1846, Forward left the Mexican coast to carry dispatches to Belize City in British Honduras and New Orleans, Louisiana. She returned to blockade duty on 7 February 1847 and took station off Veracruz once again on 9 February 1847. She continued routine blockade operations at various points along the eastern coast of Mexico until April 1847. On 15 April 1847, she received orders to set sail for Wilmington voyaging by way of New Orleans, and reached her destination on 23 May 1847.Record of Movements, p 104 Repairs completed in the summer of 1847 after reaching Wilmington cost about 2,500.King, p 136 Forward received a commendation from Commodore Perry for her participation in the Tabasco River landings, where-in he said in part: Transfer to the U.S. Coast Survey On 30 October 1847, Forward was transferred to the United States Coast Survey. On 16 December the Revenue Marine traded the Coast Survey the newly commissioned steamer for Forward. Forward returned to Revenue Marine service 6 March 1848 with a homeport of Wilmington. 1848‚Äì1861 On 6 January 1854 she was one of six Revenue Marine cutters stationed along the Atlantic coast ordered to search for the disabled steamer San Francisco in the vicinity of Bermuda.

She returned to the yard on 21 October 1857 for additional repairs and was able to return to service at Wilmington 1 December. On 26 April 1861 she was ordered to Philadelphia to receive additional armament and to cooperate with the U.S. Navy. American Civil War service On 4 May 1861, she sailed for Annapolis, Maryland under the orders of General Benjamin F.

Biography Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, Ryan graduated from Holy Cross in 1930, where he established himself as an outstanding two-sport athlete for the Crusaders. In 1926, as a member of the football team, Ryan tossed two touchdown passes to Hymie Shanahan against Harvard in a 19-14 HC victory. It was, however, in baseball where Ryan gained the most fame, as he was the star shortstop on Crusader teams that won the Eastern Intercollegiate Championship in 1929 and 1930. The team posted a 45-5-1 record in those years. Ryan was inducted into the Holy Cross Varsity Club Hall of Fame posthumously in 1964. While a student at Holy Cross, Ryan spent the summer of 1928 playing for the Orleans town team in the Cape Cod Baseball League, and returned to the league in 1929 to play for the Osterville team. Ryan's 1934 Goudey baseball card After college graduation, Ryan signed with the Chicago White Sox and hit a home run in his first time at bat at Comiskey Park. In 87 at bats, however, Ryan batted only .207 that year and showed little of the fielding range that later became his hallmark. In 1932, he was traded to the Giants for Doc Marshall. The Giants won the World Series in 1933 and Ryan, batting .238 in 146 games, finished ninth in National League MVP voting. An AP piece appearing in the New York Herald Journal January 28, 1934, celebrating the signing of Ryan's contract for that year said, \\"Ryan, only 26 years old and not long out of Holy Cross, was a sensation in his first full year as a major leaguer. He not only plugged the hole at shortstop left by Jackson, but had much to do with instilling a conviction they could win the pennant. Typical of this inspiration was the telegram he sent to (Giants‚Äô manager Bill) Terry, at a time when the team was in a bad slump in the West, Ryan out of the game with a spike wound. The telegram said, ‚ÄòThey cannot beat us. En route. J.C. Ryan.‚Äô\\" The next year he was at his best. Ryan's fielding range factor was 0.47 above the league average. He had 125 hits, batting .242 in 110 games. But the Giants traded him in a four-player deal to get All-Star shortstop Dick Bartell. Ryan did not sustain the form he had shown in 1934, however. After a respectable 1935 season in backup roles for the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees, he did not play in 1936 but spent 1937 and 1938 back with the Giants. After his Major League career ended in 1938, Ryan joined the Navy and served in World War II with Naval Intelligence. He later married and raised a family in Swampscott, Massachusetts, where, in 1959, he died at age 53.

It was first formed on 1 August 1916 as a squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. It was disbanded on 31 January 1991 at RAF Leuchars. History =1916 to 1919= No. 64 Squadron Royal Flying Corps was formed at Sedgeford in Norfolk on 1 August 1916. Initially, it was equipped with a variety of types for training purposes, including Henry Farmans, Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2bs, Avro 504s and Sopwith Pups. In June 1917, the squadron re-equipped with its intended operational equipment, the Airco DH.5 fighter, and began to work up ready for operations.Halley 1980, pp. 101‚Äì102. The DH.5 had poor altitude performance,Bruce 1965, p. 131. and so the squadron extensively practiced low- level flying both prior to and following its move to France on 14 October 1917.Jones 1934, p. 235. On 20 November, the British launched the Battle of Cambrai, an offensive supported by the use of large number of tanks and No. 64 Squadron supported the British troops, flying many low-level ground attack missions, both during the British attack,Jones 1934, pp. 235‚Äì240, 243‚Äì247. and during the German counterattack that followed.Jones 1934, pp. 253‚Äì254. The DH.5s were replaced by SE.5As in March 1918 and conducted both fighter and ground-attack operations for the remainder of the First World War. It returned to Narborough in February 1919, where it was disbanded on 31 December 1919. During the World War I era, the squadron claimed in excess of 130 victories, and produced eleven aces, among whom were James Anderson Slater, Edmund Tempest, Philip Scott Burge, Thomas Rose, Charles Cudemore, William H. Farrow, Dudley Lloyd-Evans, Edward Dawson Atkinson, and Ronald McClintock. =1936 to 1939= On 1 March 1936, 64 Squadron reformed at Heliopolis, Egypt, from two flights detached from 6 and 208 Squadrons, both equipped with the Hawker Demon two-seat biplane fighters although it was officially announced that it was based at Henlow, Bedfordshire in order to not give the impression that British air strength in Egypt was being built up.Dunnell 2015, p. 34. Italy had invaded Ethiopia in October 1935, and Britain feared that the war could escalate into a conflict between Britain and Italy. As a result, the squadron moved to Ismailia in North-East Egypt on 9 April 1936. If hostilities broke out, its orders were to move west to Mersa Matruh, with duties of attacking Italian airfields and providing fighter cover to refuelling bombers at advance airfields.Dunnell 2015, pp. 32‚Äì35. By the beginning of June 1936, Italy had conquered Ethiopia, ending the risk of war between Britain and Italy. The squadron left Egypt for the United Kingdom in August 1936 to become part of the UK air defences.Dunnell 2015, p. 36. 64 Squadron Demon I in June 1938 On return to Britain, the squadron was based at RAF Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, initially as part of 11 Group and transferring to 12 Group in October 1937. From May 1938 64 squadron's two-seat Demons were based at RAF Church Fenton, North Yorkshire and the unit was reequipped with Bristol Blenheim Mk I(F) fighters starting in December 1938. After the outbreak of the Second World War, the squadron was engaged in patrols off the British East Coast and in December 1939 provided fighter defence for the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow from Evanton, Scotland, for a month. =1940 to 1967= A Meteor NF.14 from 64 Sqn. at the Midland Air Museum. In April 1940 the squadron converted to the Supermarine Spitfire Mk I. It was immediately engaged in the covering of the Dunkirk evacuation and later took part in the Battle of Britain. In short order 64 squadron operated from Kenley starting 16 May 1940, from Leconfield starting 19 August, from Biggin Hill starting 13 October, from Coltishall starting 15 October, and from Boscombe Down starting 1 September 1940. In May 1941, No. 64 Squadron moved up to Scotland for air defence duties but moved back south in November to take part in sweeps over northern France, until March 1943 when it moved back up to Scotland again. Then in August 1943 it moved back south again to resume offensive operations and in June 1944, moved to Cornwall for 2 months before beginning long-range escort missions from East Anglia. During that time the squadron was equipped with various marks of the Spitfire: Mk IIA January to November 1941, Mk VB November 1941 to July 1942, and March to September 1943, Mk VC September 1943 to July 1944, and finally Mk IX June 1942 to March 1943, and June to November 1944. In 1944 64 Squadron took part in the operations of the Normandy Landings, Operation Market Garden, and the Battle of the Scheldt. Personnel of 64 Squadron in front of their Gloster Javelin FAW.7 at RAF Duxford in 1959. In November 1944 the squadron received the North American Mustang III and flew these for the rest of the war covering daylight raids of the RAF Bomber Command on Germany. After the end of hostilities the squadron moved to RAF Horsham St Faith and received the Mustang IV in August 1945. In March 1946 No. 64 Squadron received De Havilland Hornet F.1 twin-engined fighters and moved to RAF Linton-on-Ouse in August of the same year. The F.1 was replaced by the Hornet F.3 in April 1948. In March 1951 the squadron converted to the Gloster Meteor F.4/F.8 jet fighter. The squadron was also relocated to RAF Duxford. In September 1956 the F.8s were replaced by the radar-equipped, two seat Meteor NF.12/NF.14. In September 1958 64 squadron then converted to the Gloster Javelin FAW.7/FAW.9. In 1964 the squadron moved to RAF Tengah, partnering No. 60 Squadron RAF. The squadron was disbanded on 16 June 1967. =1968 to 1991= Since then the squadron had been the 'Shadow'/Reserve identity of No. 228 OCU, flying the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FG.1/FGR.2, first from RAF Coningsby since 16 May 1968 and then from RAF Leuchars, to where the OCU moved on 22 April 1987. When No. 228 OCU was disbanded on 31 January 1991, so was No. 64 Squadron.

The poem seems to exist in order to refute an ascription to Homer himself. Oechalia (also known as the \\"city of Eurytus\\") was an ancient Greek city whose capture by Heracles was said to be the main subject of the epic. It is debated, based on a scholium from a line in Euripides' Medea whether Medea's poisoning of Creon may have been another feature,Medea 264. which Franz Stoessl suggested will have been a comparative aside in the telling of Deianira,Stoessel, Der Tod des Heracles (Zurich, 1945:16ff), noted in Malcolm Davies, \\"Deianeira and Medea: A foot- note to the pre-history of two myths\\", Mnemosyne, Fourth Series, 42.3/4 (1989:469-472) p. 469 note 6. in her original guise as the \\"man-destroyer\\" of her etymology: \\"the innocent Deianeira, whose murder of Heracles is tragically inadvertent, will be a later invention,\\" Malcolm Davies asserts,Davies 1989:469; Davies raises doubts about the use of Medea as a parallel in . \\"perhaps the brain-child of Sophocles.\\"In Sophocles' Women of Trachis. The ancient Greek geographer Strabo noted in his Geographica that the true location of the city was unknown even to him, saying that various sources referred to Oechalia by many different names and placed it in various locations around Greece. Further complicating the factual details behind the epic is the fact that there seemed to have been several different cities called Oechalia, only one of which was discussed in it.Strabo. Geography, 9.301. In his play The Women of Trachis, Sophocles however seems to locate the city of Oechalia on the island of Euboea, making reference to the fact that Heracles, who had sacked the city all for the love of Eurytus's beautiful daughter Iole, had just returned from the island after having taken her, as well as other Oechalians, captive in the opening scenes of the play. When the wife of Heracles, Deianira, asks who this beautiful woman is who has been brought to her home, Lichas responds by telling her that \\"she's a Euboean\\".Sophocles. \\"The Women of Trachis\\".

He contributed to the team having a 10-3 record and reaching the third round of the UIL playoffs. He was a two-time first-team All-District selection and an all-state running back. He was ranked by Rivals.com as the 38th best high school running back in America. College career Battle accepted a football scholarship from the University of Houston, while majoring in Sports administration. As a redshirt freshman, he appeared in 11 games (no starts); collecting 102 carries for 560 yards (second on the team), a 5.5-yard average and 9 rushing touchdowns (tied for the team lead). In the 2003 Hawaii Bowl he had 19 carries for 124 yards (6.5-yard avg.) and 3 touchdowns. As a sophomore, he appeared in 5 games (one start). He missed the last 5 contests of the season after tearing a tendon in one of his fingers. He tallied 49 carries for 209 yards (third on the team) and 2 touchdowns. As a junior, he appeared in 12 games (3 starts). He compiled 106 carries for 408 yards (second on the team) and 5 touchdowns. As a senior, he formed a potent running back duo with Anthony Alridge.

Professional career =2007 NFL Combine= =Dallas Cowboys= Battle was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 2007 NFL Draft. He couldn't pass running backs Marion Barber III, Julius Jones and Tyson Thompson on the depth chart during training camp. He was waived injured with a sprained ankle on August 27. =Kansas City Chiefs= Battle while with the Chiefs in 2010. 2007 On November 21, 2007, He was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs to their practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on December 12. On December 23, Battle scored a touchdown in his first NFL carry in a 25-20 loss to the Detroit Lions. A week later, on December 30, Battle set a career-high of 44 rushing yards on 13 carries in an OT loss to the New York Jets. As a rookie, he finished with 47 yards on 14 carries. 2008 Battle was released by the Chiefs during the final roster cuts in 2008. Battle was then signed to the practice squad. Battle was made active again on November 1, 2008 to back up Kolby Smith, who was replacing the suspended Larry Johnson. He was cut and re-signed later that month. The only statistics he recorded in the season were two special teams tackles and a -2 yard reception on a screen pass against the Denver Broncos. 2009 In a game against the Dallas Cowboys during week 5 of the 2009 NFL season, Battle suffered a torn rotator cuff in his shoulder while trying to bust a wedge during kick coverage. He underwent surgery and was put on injured reserve, ending his season. Ironically, Larry Johnson, who was at the time the only back ahead of Battle on the depth chart, left the team a mere three weeks later. Battle was re-signed to a 1-year contract the following off-season. 2010 In the 2010 season, Battle came in behind a lot of depth. Jamaal Charles had had a breakout performance to end the 2009 season, and the Chiefs had also recently signed veteran Thomas Jones from the New York Jets, drafted rookie Dexter McCluster from Ole Miss. Battle dominated in the preseason, leading the Chiefs in rushing yards with 180 yards on 35 carries. However, he saw little action to start the regular season. Battle saw his first carries late in the fourth quarter of a week 3 game against the San Francisco 49ers. Later, Battle scored his second career touchdown in the 4th quarter of a 42-20 week 7 rout of the Jacksonville Jaguars. The next week vs. the Buffalo Bills, Battle converted a key 3rd down run during a 13-10 overtime win. 2011 In game 2 of the 2011 season, starter Jamaal Charles went-down with an ACL injury for the year, giving Battle more carries. He got two carries and a critical first-down late in the Chiefs' week 4 22-17 comeback win over the Minnesota Vikings, their first win of the season. He had a career day the next week, rushing for 119 yards on 19 carries, including a career-long 24-yard carry in a 28-24 comeback win over the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts jumped to a 17-0 lead, but the Chiefs' renewed rushing attack controlled the ball for a full 20:15 in the 2nd half, preventing the Colts from scoring in the final 30:09. In week 16 of the 2011 NFL season, Battle injured his foot during the Chiefs/Raiders game, which eventually would lead to a Chiefs loss and end their playoff hopes. Battle was placed on injured reserve, but would be the Chiefs leading rusher by the end of the season. Battle became a free agent after his contract expired. Battle as a member of the Tennessee Titans in 2013 =San Diego Chargers= 2012 Battle signed with the San Diego Chargers to a one-year contract on July 20, 2012. He started in Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs. He had 15 carries for 39 yards with a team-high four catches for 42 yards. =Tennessee Titans= 2013 On July 24, 2013, Battle signed with the Tennessee Titans on a one-year contract. He was fined $21,000 for lowering the crown of his helmet while running a route against the Houston Texans on September 20, 2013. He was the first running back in the league to be fined under this newly implemented rule, however under further investigation, the fine was retracted. 2014 Battle re-signed with the Titans on a one- year deal on February 25, 2014. It was announced that he would be learning the fullback position to provide competition to Collin Mooney. He was not re- signed after the season.

Though nominally a vassal of the sovereign Duke of Brittany, L√©on was functionally independent of any external controls until the viscounts came under attack by Henry II of England. It thus became the focus of revolts and wars when Brittany was drawn into the Angevin empire. The history of L√©on's early counts is obscure. The original vicecomites (viscounts) of L√©on were public officials appointed by the comites (counts) of Cornouaille, but by the mid-eleventh century they had usurped public authority in their province. Their ability to remain independent of both count and duke was likely due to their remoteness in the extremity of the Armorican peninsula. Unlike their Breton neighbours they did not participate in the Norman conquest of England in 1066.Everard, 16. Count Harvey, however, did participate on the side of Stephen of Blois in the nineteen years of civil war in England called The Anarchy. The viscounts also fought with the Duke of Brittany in attempts to maintain their independence. Henry II had ordered Conan IV, Duke of Brittany, to march against L√©on. Conan IV's eventual successor, Henry II's son, Geoffrey Plantagent, went to war against Guihomar IV, Viscount of L√©on. In the course of these wars most of the castles of the viscounts of L√©on were razed and Guihomar's lands‚Äîhis source of revenue‚Äîwere significantly reduced. These conflict over authority in L√©on continued down to the reign of John II. In 1235 the subvassals of L√©on and Penthi√®vre brought a series of complaints, the Communes petitiones Britonum, against the duke, Peter of Dreux, to Louis IX of France.Everard, 18. They claimed that the viscounts of L√©on had never theretofore been subject to the custody of or relief from the duke nor had they been required to seek permission for the construction of fortresses. They had always had the right of wreck, that is, a monopoly on shipwrecks and their cargoes on the coasts. They had the right to draw up testaments and to dispense with alms and make arrangements for debt-payment freely. The duke, they said, did not have a right to exact oaths of homage from the viscount's men and the viscount had the right of placitum spade (\\"pleas of the sword\\"). The right of wreck alone yielded 100,000 solidi per annum in revenues from a single rock on the treacherous coast, which an earlier viscount, Guihomar, had called his \\"most precious stone.\\" Panorama of Brest from the pont de Recouvrance of the Ch√¢teau de Brest and the Tour Tanguy.

Playing career After one season of junior hockey playing for the Soo Indians, Battaglia played college ice hockey for Western Michigan University. He spent four years at WMU and played in 139 games, and scored 47 points in the process. His solid but unspectacular scoring record led to him signing for the Florida Everblades in the ECHL for the 2002‚Äì03 season. Battaglia played almost 50 games for the Everblades, but managed just 13 points. He would also play at the higher AHL level for the Lowell Lock Monsters on 9 occasions, but failed to score a single point. For the 2003‚Äì04 season, Battaglia would sign for another ECHL organization, the Mississippi Sea Wolves. Battaglia settled well, and in his first season made 67 regular season appearances, scoring 37 points. He would also feature in the post-season and was one of the Sea Wolves' most reliable players, with 6 points in 5 games. His productivity meant that he would remain in Mississippi for the 2004‚Äì05 season, and Battaglia again flourished. In 75 games, he managed to score 60 points, proving his quality at ECHL level. Battaglia also played with his brother Jon Bates Battaglia, who signed with the Sea Wolves during the NHL lockout. The Sea Wolves suspended operations in the middle of the off-season because of Hurricane Katrina. Battaglia would remain in the ECHL, but split the 2005‚Äì06 season between the Utah Grizzlies and the Augusta Lynx. Despite the lack of consistency, Battaglia managed to maintain his level of play, and in 72 games for the two teams, scored 54 points. Battaglia would again move teams in the off-season, signing for the Columbia Inferno. He played well and in 47 games scored 45 points. This led to his mid-season move in March 2007 to sign for the EIHL team, the Manchester Phoenix. It was Battaglia's first taste of European hockey, but he continued to impress with 13 points in the 13 games he featured in before the season ended. Despite impressing, Battaglia returned to North America and re-signed for the Inferno, and once again became an important player for the organization. In March 2008, Battaglia was part of a 5 player swap which sent him again to the Augusta Lynx. On 4 September 2008 his move to the Mississippi Sea Wolves was confirmed. For the 2009‚Äì10 season, Battaglia played with the Amarillo Gorillas of the Central Hockey League. On August 24, 2010, Battaglia signed with the Mississippi RiverKings, to remain in the Central Hockey League. After playing in 16 games with the RiverKings to start the 2010‚Äì11 season, Battaglia was released and signed with fellow CHL team the Tulsa Oilers on December 24, 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 season, Battaglia moved to the Federal Hockey League, playing for the New Jersey Outlaws. He followed the franchise to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, for the 2012‚Äì13, playing with team until it folded on January 21, 2013. He then joined the Huntsville Havoc of the Southern Professional Hockey League. Battaglia played in the Federal Hockey League for the Dayton Demonz. He finished his hockey days with the Mississippi Surge of the Southern Professional Hockey League when he retired on February 18, 2014.

Drevja Church was the main church for the municipality. History Drevja Church The municipality of Drevja was established on 1 July 1927 when the large Vefsn Municipality was divided into three municipalities: Drevja (population: 964) in the north, Grane (population: 1,746) in the south, and Vefsn (population: 3,119) in the center. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the municipality of Drevja (population: 1,001) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Elsfjord (population: 920) and Vefsn (population: 5,358) and with the town of Mosj√∏en) to form a new, larger Vefsn Municipality. Name The municipality was named after the river Drevja (which flows from the lake Drevvatnet to the Vefsnfjorden). The name of the river is derived from the word (meaning 'rubbish' or 'waste'), thus the meaning is 'the river with unclean water'. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Drevja, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Drevja was made up of 13 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

Antarctica was chosen as the optimal site to study the atmosphere because of its remote location and relatively undisturbed environment. Research in many fields has been conducted in Antarctica through ITASE, including astronomy, atmospheric sciences, biology, earth sciences, environmental science, geology, glaciology, marine biology, oceanography, and geophysics. History A 1990 meeting held in Grenoble, France, served as a site of discussion regarding national ice coring efforts and the possibility of international collaboration between the world‚Äôs top scientists. As a result, nineteen nations worldwide, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K. and the United States, teamed up to study the surface and subsurface record of Antarctica‚Äôs ice cores. These countries agreed that an understanding of Antarctica‚Äôs climate and atmospheric composition (gathered through ice core examination) would provide greater insight into the understanding of climate change on a global level. The ITASE Planning Document was formally recommended to XXII SCAR (Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research) in a 1992 meeting in Bariloche, Argentina, by the Working Group on Glaciology. The SCAR officials approved this preliminary implementation of the ITASE project, naming it ‚ÄúRecommendation Glaciology XXII-5.‚Äù SCAR allowed ITASE to contribute to its six main initiatives regarding Antarctica, and further accepted ITASE under one of its primary initiatives, GLOCHANT (Global Change in Antarctica) during the XXIII SCAR meeting in Cambridge, England. ITASE was also adopted as a Past Global Changes (PAGES) project in 1993. The ITASE project reached its culmination in a workshop in Cambridge, U.K., during August 2-3, 1996. The US ITASE Science and Implementation Plan was published a few months before, in May, following a US ITASE workshop in Baltimore, Maryland. Objective Because Antarctica has played a major role in global systems (i.e. atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, etc.) scientists hoped to expand on the little knowledge of Antarctica‚Äôs complex climate that was available. This data was collected primarily during the past 30 to 40 years. High resolution ice cores have been recognized, since, as the most direct and reliable record of the ‚Äúsoluble, insoluble and gaseous components of the atmosphere at resolutions as fine as seasonal and, potentially, on time scales as long as a million years‚Äù (International). Through ice core analysis, scientists are able to study past environments on earth and, more importantly, predict future environmental trends. Ice cores formed from polar glaciers generally contain the best preserved records of all geographic locations. Substances transported by the atmosphere and trapped within glacial ice reveal factors that cause environmental change as well as global responses to this change. Results from deep ice core studies conducted in Greenland correspond with results of these Antarctic studies. Similar changes in parameters such as temperature, snow accumulation, wind-blown dust, sea-salt loading and methane composition indicate global climatic trends ‚Äì that conclusions made from studies done in Antarctica may very well apply to the entire globe.

History On 14 September 1866 the 36th Peel Battalion was authorized. During the Boer War the regiment, as a unit, did not go to war; however, many officers and men from the regiment served there. During the First World War, the regiment as such were not mobilized but drafts from various units were called up and formed into numbered battalions. After the war, the 36th Peel Regiment was reorganized, becoming the Peel and Dufferin Regiment in 1923. The regimental badge adopted was the Demi Lion which was the personal crest of Sir Robert Peel. On 15 December 1936, following a general reorganization of the Militia, the Lorne Rifles and the Peel and Dufferin Regiment were amalgamated to form the present regiment, The Lorne Scots (Peel, Dufferin and Halton Regiment).http://www.army.dnd.ca/LORNE_SCOTS/content/welcome.htm =Peel Regiment (1921‚Äì1923)= The county regiments, which had been by-passed during the First World War, were in dire need of revitalization. Lieutenant-Colonel McCausland, who had commanded the 74th Battalion, was appointed to command the 36th Peel Regiment in 1920, and the regiment was disbanded and reorganized as the Peel Regiment. Some of the officers felt they would have to recruit from beyond the bounds of the county in order to be viable, the Headquarters, A and B Companies were located in a large second story flat at the corner of Pacific and Dundas Streets in West Toronto; C Company was in Brampton and D Company in Port Credit. Some of the Toronto regiments had objected to this incursion, and in March 1922, the unit was directed that its officer personnel should reside within the recruiting area. McCausland, who lived in Toronto, resigned, as did numerous other officers. Major RV Conover, who had served with the Halton Rifles, but commanded the company in Brampton, where he now lived, was selected to succeed in command. The regiment perpetuated the 74th, 126th and 234th Battalions, Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). [69th Bn?] It could have been expected that it would also perpetuate the 20th, but some of its veterans could not come to an agreement on the project, so the regiment missed the opportunity to perpetuate a CEF battalion that had seen service in the field. On Sunday, November 5, 1922 a memorial window was dedicated in the Church of the Epiphany on Queen Street, West Toronto to the 3,200 all ranks who had passed through the Peel Regiment from 1914‚Äì1918, and the five hundred who had given their lives. =The Peel and Dufferin Regiment (1923‚Äì1936)= The Peel Regiment had had a presence in Dufferin county, in Orangeville and Shelburne. Perhaps the insistence on officers coming from the recruiting area led to the formal inclusion of Dufferin in the regimental title. In 1923 The Peel and Dufferin Regiment was authorized, to draw from both counties. D Company was headquartered at Orangeville. Early that year the Regiment had received permission from Sir Robert Peel (after whose family the county had been named), to use part of his crest as a regimental badge. The crest is 'a demi- lion rampant, gorged and collared, charged with three bezants, between the paws a shuttle'. (A bezant in heraldry is a gold roundel, and takes its name from the gold coins 'of Byzantium' which circulated in England in medieval times). The demi-lion was quickly incorporated into the design of the buttons, and in 1925 into the cap badge and collar badges of the new unit. Annual training in 1925 was conducted at local headquarters; because of fiscal restraints, in three sessions of three days each. Lieutenant-Colonel Conover, who was now on the district staff, arranged a three-day musketry camp at Long Branch Rifle Ranges over Labour Day, introducing the idea of district training. The three regiments of the 25th Infantry Brigade who attended, however, had to pay for their own transportation and ration expenses. The training exercises now went beyond the drill and rifle practice of earlier days, and during the inter-war years involved attack and defensive positions, inter-arm co-operation (the artillery came out to the farmlands west of Brampton and demonstrated a smoke screen), ground to air signalling, and even aerial bombardment. The colours of the old 36th Regiment had been laid up in Christ Church, Brampton in 1924, and the following year the Peel Chapter, Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire, presented a king's colour to The Peel and Dufferin Regiment. The county of Peel gave a grant in 1924 towards the purchase of a regimental colour, but its production was delayed pending a decision on the granting of battle honours to militia regiments. The battle honours assigned to The Peel and Dufferin Regiment in 1930 were: *Ypres, 1915 & '17, Festubert 1915, Somme 1916, Arras 1917, '18, Hill 70, Amiens, Hindenburg Line, Pursuit to Mons. The Department of National Defense approved the design for the regimental colour, incorporating these battle honours, and on 22 May 1930 the Governor General, Viscount Willingdon, presented the colour on behalf of the county council. Major CM Corkett had served during the First World War as an officer with The Lancashire Fusiliers, and The Peel and Dufferin Regiment sought an alliance with that regiment. The negotiations went slowly because the 2nd Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers, were serving in India, but eventually they signified their favour and in November 1929 the unit was informed that the king approved of the alliance. To symbolize the link, permission was received to adopt the white facings of the Fusiliers.

Biography Anatol von Lieven was born on November 16, 1872 in St. Petersburg, Russia. He has studied law in the University of St. Petersburg but later was admitted into Nicholas cavalry school which he graduated with the rank of podporuchik. From 1896 until 1908 he served as an officer in Cavalry Guards regiment. In 1908 he left the army and traveled to Courland where his family owned several manors. Until the First World war he owned and lived in the Me≈æotne Palace near Bauska. When the war started he returned into active service in his cavalry regiment and in 1917 was granted rank of the rotmistr (cavalry captain). After the October Revolution, he returned to Latvia and in December 1918, arrived in LiepƒÅja. In January 1919, he started formation of LiepƒÅja volunteer rifleman unit. Core of the newly established unit was 60 officers of Russian Imperial army. Soon, this unit was complemented with one company of Baltische Landeswehr and one company under command of captain Didorov. The unit became known as Lƒ´venie≈°i and it participated in Latvian War of Independence fighting against Bolsheviks. During pro-German coup in April 1919, Lieven refused to collaborate with pro-German government. Later, his unit was incorporated into Baltische Landeswehr and participated in battles around Ventspils, Jelgava and also liberation of Riga. On 24 May 1919, Lieven was seriously wounded near Ropa≈æi, and injury left him slightly lame for the rest of his life. On June 6, 1919, Lieven's unit was transformed to Russian volunteer corps with around 4000 man. Lieven forbade his men to fight the Estonian Army and Northern Latvia brigade in Vidzeme, unlike the rest of the Baltische Landeswehr. His detachment only performed rear security duties for the Landeswehr during the campaign. When the Strazdumui≈æa ceasefire was signed between Baltische Landeswehr and Estonian army, Lieven transformed his corps into West Russian Volunteer Army. Another two Russian units joined his army. Those were partisan unit Cavalry General count Keller under command of Pavel Bermondt Avalov and infantry brigade under command of colonel Virgolitz. On 9 July, his army received an order from Nikolai Yudenich to move to Narva and join his northwest army's offensive to Petrograd. Pavel Bermondt Avalov and colonel Virgolitz refused to leave Latvia and stayed in Jelgava. Bermondt took over command of the army and during October‚ÄìNovember 1919, was defeated by Latvian army. Lieven went to Estonia and until December 1919, fought with Yudenich army around Petrograd. He also traveled to London and Paris and tried to negotiate further military support to Yudenich, however unsuccessfully. After the civil war, Lieven became a Latvian citizen and a manufacturer of bricks. Early in 1920, he returned to his Me≈æotne palace but soon traveled to France. He returned to Latvia in 1924; but meanwhile, Latvian agrarian reforms were launched and his Me≈æotne palace was nationalized and lands divided. However, he was granted small manor nearby Mazme≈æotne manor, and he lived there and also in Riga for the rest of his life. Later, he established Mazme≈æotne brick factory. He was also active in the anticommunist movement and led a local detachment of the Brotherhood of Russian Truth. Anatoly von Lieven died on April 3, 1937 in ƒ∂emeri, Latvia. He was buried in the yard of the Me≈æotne lutheran church.

The judgment was issued on 21 October 2004 and relates to the scope to be accorded to patent claims, including the doctrine of equivalents. The case and subsequent judgment affirmed principles from a prior case, Catnic Components Ltd. v. Hill & Smith Ltd. The issue was whether the claims of a European patent granted to Kirin-Amgen, Inc. were infringed by Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. and Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd in a situation where there was a remarkable similarity between the technologies employed by the two parties for producing the hormone erythropoietin. Infringement was not found due to the language used in the claims of the Amgen patent. The reasoning in the judgment has presently formed a basis for the current practice of the UK Intellectual Property Office, and other countries that take great consideration of the legal implications of British case law, when assessing whether a patent has been infringed by a device or process which is equivalent to the patented invention. (See also Doctrine of equivalents.) Background Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (\\"Amgen\\"), a Californian pharmaceutical company, was the proprietor of relating to the production of the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (EPO) by recombinant DNA technology. Amgen sued Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (\\"TKT\\") for patent infringement. TKT, a Massachusetts corporation, had also developed a method of making EPO using a process of gene activation. Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (\\"Hoechst\\") was sued for proposing to import TKT‚Äôs EPO into the United Kingdom. EPO, a previously known glycoprotein hormone, is made in the kidney and stimulates the production of red blood cells by the bone marrow. =Kirin-Amgen‚Äôs invention versus TKT‚Äôs invention= The Amgen team succeeded for the first time in establishing the correct sequence of the amino acid residues in the EPO gene which coded for human EPO and its leader sequence. The Amgen patent addressed introducing this newly characterised gene into another organism (a self- replicating unicellular organism such as bacteria, yeast or mammalian cells in culture). The result was that the existing machinery for gene expression in the transfected microbial host cells operated to construct the desired product, EPO. The Amgen technique described using exogenous DNA as a template for transcription of mRNA which is then translated into a continuous sequence of amino acid residues within the transformed microbial host cells. In TKT's gene activation method, the EPO is expressed in a human cell by an endogenous gene that is naturally present but typically dormant, or by cells derived by replication from such a cell. The TKT technique involved introducing the necessary control sequence into the DNA within a human cell upstream from the latent EPO gene. This different exogenous control sequence DNA had to be inserted into the human DNA at exactly the right point upstream of the EPO gene to enable it to activate or \\"switch-on\\" the inherent EPO gene in a human cell, which would not ordinarily express the EPO glycoprotein. The essential difference between Amgen's EPO and TKT's EPO (which are chemically identical) is that the former is made by an exogenous DNA sequence coding for EPO that had been introduced into an host cell; and the latter is made by an endogenous DNA sequence coding for EPO in a human cell into which an exogenous promoter sequence has been inserted. However, the technique of inserting a promoter sequence to transform microbial host cells to construct a desired product was not generally known at the time that the Amgen patent application was published, and was not addressed in the Amgen patent specification or claims. =Infringement= The principal issue in the case was whether TKT's EPO fell outside the claims of Amgen's patent suit because of the difference in the way it was made. The key Amgen claims in issue can be summarised as: *(1) a DNA sequence for use in securing the expression of EPO in a host cell, *(19) EPO which is characterised by being the product of eucaryotic expression of an exogenous DNA sequence with further characteristics that made it different from pre-existing EPO, and *(26) EPO which is the product of the expression in a host cell of a DNA sequence according to claim 1. Only claims 19 and 26 were alleged to have been infringed because TKT did not make any of its EPO in the UK. The alleged infringement was by importation. Claim 26 cannot be understood without interpretation of claim 1. =Amgen‚Äôs claims= Amgen's asserted Claims were expressly as follows: Claims 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 were all dependent on claim 1 in the sense that if the TKT method did not involve using a \\"DNA sequence for use in securing expression (of EPO) in a‚Ä¶host cell\\" within the meaning of Claim 1, then TKT would not infringe any of the other claims either. =The law= Prior to the UK Patents Act 1977, which gave effect to the European Patent Convention (\\"EPC\\") in the UK, the extent of protection conferred by a patent was governed by the common law, the terms of the royal grant and general principles of construction of documents. Lord Diplock expounded his new principles of \\"purposive construction\\" in the leading case of Catnic Components Ltd. v. Hill & Smith Ltd., in respect of a patent granted before 1977. After the UK Patents Act 1977 the extent of protection conferred by a UK-EPC patent was governed by specific EPC provisions. Article 84 of the EPC specifies the role of the claims in an application to the European Patent Office for a European patent as follows: > The claims shall define the matter for which protection is sought. They > shall be clear and concise and be supported by the description. Article 69 of the EPC, which applies to infringement proceedings for a European patent in the domestic courts of all EPC Contracting States provides: > The extent of the protection conferred by a European patent or a European > patent application shall be determined by the terms of the claims. > Nevertheless, the description and drawings shall be used to interpret the > claims. And a further \\"Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69\\" reads as follows:Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69, MR/13/00 dated 20 November 2000, submitted by the United Kingdom delegation. > Article 69 should not be interpreted in the sense that the extent of the > protection conferred by a European patent is to be understood as that > defined by the strict, literal meaning of the wording used in the claims, > the description and drawings being employed only for the purpose of > resolving an ambiguity found in the claims. Neither should it be interpreted > in the sense that the claims serve only as a guideline and that the actual > protection conferred may extend to what, from a consideration of the > description and drawings by a person skilled in the art, the patentee has > contemplated. On the contrary, it is to be interpreted as defining a > position between these extremes which combines a fair protection for the > patentee with a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties. Before the EPC came into effect, and until the House of Lords decision in Catnic, the words and grammar of a patent claim, in the absence of ambiguity, were to be given their natural and ordinary meaning. That is to say, they were to be given the meanings assigned to the words by a dictionary and to the syntax by a grammar. This meaning was to be adopted regardless of the context or background against which the words were used, unless the words used were \\"ambiguous\\"; i.e., capable of having more than one meaning. The previous law was declared by Lord Porter in Electric & Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd (1938) 56 RPC 23, 57 as follows: > If the Claims have a plain meaning in themselves, then advantage cannot be > taken of the language used in the body of the Specification to make them > mean something different. Lord Diplock changed this principle in the House of Lords decision in Catnic Components Ltd v Hill & Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183, 243 when he said that the new British approach to contract interpretation should also be applied to the construction of patent claims. He summarises this as: \\"A patent specification should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one\\", where \\"purposive construction\\" means understanding language in accordance with what a reasonable person would understand the author to be using the words to mean. \\"Purposive construction\\" as applied to patent claims does not mean extending or going beyond the definition of the technical matter for which the patentee seeks protection in the claims. The question is always what the person skilled in the art would have understood the patentee to be using the language of the claim to mean. There is no presumption about the width of the claims. A patent may, for one reason or another, claim less than it teaches or enables. By way of contrast, the effect of the doctrine of equivalents under United States law is to extend protection to something outside the claims which performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result. Lord Diplock preferred to adopt a principle of construction which actually gave effect to what the person skilled in the art would have understood the patentee to be claiming. Subsequently, Article 69 of the EPC has confirmed that there can be no patent protection under UK law which extends protection outside the scope of the claims, so interpreted. The Protocol requires a UK court, in interpreting patent claims, to reconcile the objectives of giving a Patentee the full extent of the monopoly which the person skilled in the art would think he was intending to claim, without giving the patentee more than the full extent of the monopoly which the person skilled in the art would think that he was intending to claim. In other words, a Patentee is to be bound by his claims, properly understood. This means giving the patentee the full extent, but not more than the full extent, of the monopoly which a reasonable person skilled in the art, reading the claims in context, would think he was intending to claim. A corresponding United States decision which may represent the beginning of a similar tendency is Phillips v. AWH (CAFC 2005, en banc), 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1332 (2006). The principal question in that case was the extent to which a court should resort to the patent specification in seeking to ascertain the proper scope of its claims. The conclusion was that claims should definitely be read in the context of the specification. In passing, the court cited Bates v Coe 98 US 31, 38 (1878), but otherwise does not focus on the intent of a Patentee, as discernible from a patent specification. > [I]n case of doubt or ambiguity it is proper in all cases to refer back to > the descriptive portions of the specification to aid in solving the doubt or > in ascertaining that true intent and meaning of the language employed in the > claims. For UK-EPC patents, while Article 69 prevents equivalence from extending protection outside the claims, equivalence can be an important part of the background of facts known to the skilled person which would affect what he understood the claims to mean. This is also expressly provided by the new Article 2 added to the Protocol by the Munich Act revising the EPC, dated 29 November 2000 (but which has not yet come into force): > (2) For the purpose of determining the extent of protection conferred by a > European patent, due account shall be taken of any element which is > equivalent to an element specified in the claims. The principles that Lord Diplock offered in the Catnic case were summarized by Lord Hoffmann in Improver Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181, 189 in terms of the three Improver principles or test procedures. Lord Hoffmann in that same decision observed that a patentee may have intended a word or phrase to have not a literal but rather a figurative meaning, the figure being a form of synecdoche - (a form of the metaphor in which the part mentioned signifies the whole); or metonymy (a form of metaphor denoting the relation between two objects. Metonymy is to synecdoche what a metaphor is to a simile). The Catnic decision established the \\"Catnic principle\\": the principle of purposive construction, but it also provided guidelines for applying that principle to equivalents. Those principles are encapsulated in the Protocol questions. However, the principle of purposive construction is the bedrock of patent construction, universally applicable. The guidelines are only guidelines, more useful in some cases than in others. Opinion of the court =Composition of the court= The case was heard by five sitting Lords of Appeal in Ordinary: *Lord Hoffmann *Lord Hope of Craighead *Lord Rodger of Earlsferry *Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, and *Lord Brown of Eaton- under-Heywood =The Amgen decision on its facts= Interpreting the claims of the Amgen patent in the context of its specification, the claims are concerned with the expression of EPO by a gene which is exogenous to the cell. But the genes which express EPO in cells by the TKT process are not exogenous. They come into existence when the cell is formed by division and simply replicate the pre-existing genes already present in the TKT cells. The TKT process works by a technique not generally known at the time when the Amgen patent application was published. A claim may, upon its proper construction, cover products or processes which involve the use of technology unknown at the time the claim was drafted. The question is whether the person skilled in the art would understand the description in a way which was sufficiently general to include the new technology. Lord Hoffmann concluded that TKT did not infringe any of the claims and dismissed Amgen's appeal. The other lords all agreed. Consequences This case affirmed that: \\"Construction is objective in the sense that it is concerned with what a reasonable person to whom the utterance was addressed would have understood the author to be using the words to mean. Notice, however, that it is not, as is sometimes said, \\"the meaning of the words the author used\\", but rather what the notional addressee would have understood the author to mean by using those words.\\" (Paragraph 32 of the judgement) It is a common misunderstanding that the words of the claims should be understood as what the author used them to mean. This is not the case. Rather, the claims should be understood as what a skilled person (at the date of filing of the application) would have understood the author to be using the words to mean. Additionally, if a claim is intended to cover products or processes which involve the use of technology unknown at the time the claim was drafted, then the patent specification and claims based thereon should be drafted so that a person skilled in the art would understand the description in a way which was sufficiently general to include the new technology.

He played football with his local clubs Ballinascarthy and St. Finbarr's and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 1969 until 1970. Holland is best known in recent times for his short-lived appointment as manager of the Cork senior football team during a period when they were on strike. Playing career =Club= Holland played his early club football with his local Ballinascarty side. He also lined out with the Carbery division in the county senior championship before moving to the famous Cork club St Finbarr's club in the early 1970s. It was with 'the Barr's' that Holland enjoyed much success. It was here that he won his first Cork Senior Football Championship medal in 1976. He won two further county medals in 1979 and in 1980. The latter victory was converted into a Munster Senior Club Football Championship title as well as an All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship title. Holland won a fourth county medal in 1982. Managerial career =Early experience= Holland's time off the field with Cork GAA began as a selector with the county senior football team in 1993. It was a great era for Cork as the team captured three successive Munster titles, however, the team failed to capture an All-Ireland crown. Holland later moved onto the Cork under-21 team where he worked as a selector again. In 1998 Holland took over as manager of the Cork minor football team. His first season in charge brought a surprise loss to Limerick. The following year saw Cork win the Munster title before going on to be defeated by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final. Holland's team retained their provincial title in 2000 before going on to win the All-Ireland title. He was appointed manager of the Cork football team in 2007 while the players were on strike protesting about the process for picking selector. The players refused to play under Holland as he was appointed during the strike. The player strike lasted until February 18, 2008 when he resigned as manager as one of the conditions of resolving the strike without ever actually working with the players. He was succeeded as team manager by Conor Counihan.

J. Holladay & Co. in the United Kingdom during the 1930s and 1940s. These kits were designed by James Hay Stevens and comprised shaped wooden blanks with cast metal detail parts. The kits were intended to educate their assemblers of the aircraft. They were designed to be built similarly to real aircraft construction. The kits were supposedly approved by \\"educational and air-minded organisations\\". These were the first model aircraft kits in the world made to a constant scale of 1:72. This scale was later adopted by many other model manufacturers, such as Frog and Airfix. Around 80 different Skybirds kits were released from 1932 onwards, marketed towards those aged 12 and over. Subjects ranged from First World War to Second World War military aircraft, plus a number of inter-war period civilian types. The company endorsed the foundation of clubs, specifically for model-making. Together, these formed the Skybird League which had its own magazine of which new issues were published four times a year. Photographs of aircraft models built could be submitted into competitions, in order to be displayed within the windows of the Hamleys toyshop in London.Page 172 of It was marvelled, by customers, that a photograph of a completed model, if finished properly, looked identical to the original article. Of course, this was somewhat easier to achieve with a completed model in the 1930s due to the fact that all photography was monochromatic. The kits encouraged photographers to experiment with scale and trickery to make the model seem more like an actual vehicle. Magazine readers sent their photographs to Skybirds, hoping them to be published within an upcoming issue. Modellers were also encouraged to produce a diorama of their completed vehicle, setting it amidst scratch-built accessories. During the Second World War, modelling became a vital part of morale for children. They could participate within the dogfights above them during the Battle Of Britain. It is possible that model making popularised the Supermarine Spitfire, despite it being statistically out-performed and out- numbered throughout the conflict by the, then, more-successful Hawker Hurricane. Manufacture ceased in 1942, and in 1945 the company closed but was soon relaunched under new management. However the Skybirds range did not survive the company's acquisition by Zang shortly afterwards.

History Nirimba is a Darug word meaning pelican. Schofields aerodrome was evaluated for use as the site of the RAN Aircraft Repair Yard, following the formation of the Royal Australian Navy Fleet Air Arm in November 1950. The RAN moved in and Schofields was temporarily commissioned as HMAS Albatross II, RANARY Schofields with a contingent of Royal Navy officers and sailors supplementing the RAN Component. In January 1952, the Royal Australian Air Force transferred control of the base to the RAN, but remained in residence until September 1952. On 1 April 1953, the Royal Australian Naval Air Repair Yard Schofields was commissioned as HMAS Nirimba, a joint RANARY and technical training establishment for RAN Fleet Air Arm. The Aircraft Repair Yard was short lived however, and was closed down in early 1955 and HMAS Nirimba and the airfield were reduced to \\"Care and Maintenance\\" status. In September 1955, preparations began to recommission HMAS Nirimba as the RAN Apprentice Training Establishment (RANATE) for Naval Apprentice training. The establishment reopened in January 1956, Captain F L George RAN assumed command. On 4 January 1956, HMAS Nirimba was paid off to recommission the next day as HMAS Nirimba, RAN Apprentice Training Establishment. Nirimba was finally decommissioned on 25 February 1994, having trained some 13,000 young men and women from the RAN and other Commonwealth navies.

A native of Evansville, Indiana, Koch was the son of Louis J. and Clarice Koch. He graduated from Purdue University in 1937 with a degree in architecture, but, although he worked in that field while in the Navy during World War II, it would be a project started by his father that would change his life. Holiday World In the 1940s, Louis Koch retired, and decided he wanted to expand the small town of Santa Claus. He started a mail-order gift shop, and, in 1946, a small theme park that he called Santa Claus Land. At first, Bill Koch didn't think much of his father's project. \\"I thought it was sort of a folly,\\" he said later. \\"I didn't think it would go anywhere.\\" In 1955, Ronald Reagan, then an actor and spokesman for General Electric, stopped for a visit. In 1984, Koch and his family, in order to make even more money from the locals & tourists, decided to include other holidays (namely Halloween and Fourth of July) in the park and the name was changed to Holiday World. In 1993, a water park - Splashin' Safari - was added, and a new Thanksgiving-themed area was also constructed in 2006. Over a million visitors a year now visit the park. Bringing an Interstate With so many projects going - seemingly all at once - Bill Koch discovered in the late 1950s that Indiana's segment of Interstate 64 was going to run from Vincennes to New Albany. This did not go over well with the man who wanted the new highway to bring people to his theme park and growing town. So, Koch started knocking on doors and attending meetings. Recalled Koch: \\"I told them, 'Gentlemen, I think the route for 64 is too far north. What do I need to do to get it to go straight across?' They said, 'You have to get the governors of Indiana and Illinois to agree to get the road changed so the Bureau of Roads will agree to relocate it.'\\" The governors couldn't resist Koch's insistent efforts, which gained traction when Evansville interests got involved as well. The highway moved south to its current location. Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial Spencer County and the state of Indiana had for many years worked to build a memorial to the formative years of Abraham Lincoln, who lived in the area around what is now Lincoln City from 1816 to 1830. In 1962, Congress approved the creation of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, and Bill Koch and his wife, Patricia, were on hand as President John F. Kennedy signed the bill into law. Personal life Bill Koch was 45 when he married Patricia Yellig, the daughter of Santa Claus Land's original Santa Claus, Jim Yellig. Patricia Yellig had been a nun, but left the Daughters of Charity in the late 1950s to move back home. Despite their age difference (Bill was 16 years her senior), Patricia and Bill were married in 1960 and had five children. Building a town around the park As Santa Claus Land grew, Koch believed that the town of Santa Claus needed to grow along with it. In the mid-1960s, he developed a gated community known as Christmas Lake Village, where the majority of the town's residents now live. He also built the town hall and a shopping center that today is decorated in a Christmas theme all year long. When Koch started, the unincorporated town had a population of 37 people; though hundreds more lived in the surrounding area. Today, more than 2,200 call Santa Claus home; though most were raised nearby in other small towns and simply moved inside the town limits of Santa Claus. This is clearly reflected in the small, near stagnant growth of the local school system. Death Bill Koch died at his home in Santa Claus on September 17, 2001, at the age of 86. Following his death, and in recognition of the many developments he was responsible for, the state of Indiana named Indiana State Highway 162 from Gentryville to Interstate 64 as the \\"William A.

George Bullock was born in Birmingham, where his mother ran an exhibition of wax models in the late 1790s. His brother, William Bullock, opened a museum of curiosities in the city in 1800. He moved it to Liverpool the next year, and George went with him. By 1804, George Bullock had left his brother's museum, and gone into business with a looking-glass maker called William Stoakes. They advertised themselves as \\"Cabinet Makers, General Furnishers and Marble Workers\\", trading from a showroom called the \\"Grecian Rooms\\" in Bold Street, Liverpool. Around 1806, Bullock dissolved his partnership with Stoakes and took over the Mona marble quarries at Llanvechell on the island of Anglesey for a lease of ¬£1000. The marble was shipped to Liverpool, where it was used for chimneypieces and other decorations. He used it widely in his furnishing schemes, such as the refurbishment of Thomas Johnes‚Äô house at Hafod. He also supplied marble to other sculptors. At about this time, a guide to Liverpool described his Grecian Rooms as offering \\"an extensive assortment of elegant and fashionable furniture; as also, statues, figures, tripods, candelabra, antique lamps, sphinxes, griffins, &c.;, in marble, bronze, and artificial stone.\\" Bullock also stocked \\"a good collection of ancient and modern busts; among the latter, those of many of the most distinguished characters in Liverpool and its neighbourhood, modelled by himself.\\" Following the success of his company he moved to London in 1813, becoming director of the company. These marbles were used in the monuments to the Rev Glover Moore in St Cuthbert's in Halsall, Lancashire, and to Anna Maria Bold in St Luke's in Farnworth, Lancashire. He exhibited at the Royal Academy in London and the Liverpool Academy between 1804 and 1816. He was the President of the Liverpool Academy in 1810 and 1811.

Stotz Memorial Little League Bridge, formerly known as the Market Street Bridge, carries approximately 27,700 vehicles a day on U.S. Route 15 over the West Branch Susquehanna River between Williamsport and South Williamsport in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is the seventh bridge on the site and was built at a cost of over $60,000,000. In October 2007 the new northbound bridge over the river and the new \\"direct connect\\" single-point urban interchange with Interstate 180 was completed and opened to traffic. The overall project, which included the reconstruction of Via Bella, was completed in summer 2008. History The Carl E. Stotz Memorial Little League Bridge is the seventh bridge to span the West Branch Susquehanna River between Williamsport and South Williamsport at Market Street since the 1840s. It was built to replace the sixth Market Street Bridge, a steel deck structure which the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation originally intended to rehabilitate and widen. When this proved to be unfeasible, plans for a new bridge were put into place. The first permanent bridge between was constructed beginning in 1844 and completed on July 5, 1849 (prior to its completion ferry boat service was available). This first Market Street Bridge, a wooden covered bridge, cost $23,797 to construct. It was owned by a private corporation, operated it as a toll bridge, and stood until March 17, 1865 when it was destroyed by a flood that left 90 percent of Williamsport underwater. The second Market Street Bridge opened on December 1, 1865 and was a wire suspension bridge built for $58,068. The bridge was dismantled in 1886. It was also owned by a private corporation. The bridge, redesigned by Alfred P. Boller in 1886, was apparently a unique looking structure that caused some embarrassment to the owners. The third Market Street Bridge was built in 1886 at a cost of $30,000 to $40,000. It was an iron truss bridge built by the Berlin Iron Company of Connecticut. It was partially destroyed by a flood on June 1, 1889, when the bridge was forced off its piers by timber that was swept down the river. This came from the Susquehanna Boom, part of the lumbering industry that helped make Williamsport one of the wealthiest cities in the world during the late 1800s. The fourth Market Street Bridge was built upon the piers of the third bridge, using parts of the third truss bridge that had been swept downstream in 1889. The fourth bridge was opened in 1890 at a cost of $38,000, and was purchased in 1891 by the Lycoming County commissioners for $113,700, who declared to be free of tolls. Improvements to the bridge included raising it by 5 feet (1.5 m) and adding a sidewalk for pedestrian traffic. The fourth Market Street Bridge was destroyed by a flood on May 21, 1894. The West Branch Susquehanna River was spanned by a fifth Market Street Bridge from 1894 until 1949. The two lane truss bridge was built by the Crofton Bridge and Manufacturing Company of Croton, New York. The bridge was nearly destroyed in 1909 when a discarded cigarette set a fire among the wooden planks of the bridge. Market Street Bridge number five was dynamited into the river and dismantled in 1949. Market Street Bridge number six was a steel deck bridge. Construction was completed in 1951 at a cost of over $3,000,000. The sixth bridge was constructed by George Vang Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was dynamited and dismantled in 2007. Construction View south from Williamsport on Carl E. Stotz Memorial Little League Bridge, showing Single Point Urban Interchange The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced its plans for the seventh Market Street Bridge in the year 2000. A groundbreaking ceremony for the new bridge was held on May 7, 2004, with the actual construction beginning on May 10. The original estimated cost of the project was $60,000,000. The new bridge was built as two spans, with the southbound span constructed first, just west (upstream) of the sixth bridge. The southbound bridge was opened to traffic on July 11, 2006. In August 2006, the old Market Street bridge was demolished. After the demolition of the old bridge, the southbound bridge carried traffic in both directions as single lanes separated by a temporary concrete barrier. Meanwhile, the new northbound span was built in the same location as the old bridge, just east (downstream) of the southbound span. The northbound bridge opened to traffic on October 10, 2007, originally as a single lane. There were two lanes of traffic in both directions on the bridge by October 15, 2007, the day that three of the four \\"direct connect\\" ramps between Interstate 180 and the bridge officially opened. The traffic lights controlling the new single- point urban interchange were activated the same day, and the last ramp, from the bridge to westbound I-180, opened by October 18. (The ramp from eastbound I-180 to the bridge had been open over a year, but only to traffic then going south.) The new Market Street Bridge was officially dedicated on October 18, 2007 at a ribbon-cutting ceremony with speeches by Mayor Mary B. Wolf of Williamsport, Lycoming County Commissioner Rebecca Burke, State Senator Roger A. Madigan, State Representative Steven W Capelli, and others. The bridge was renamed in August 2011 to honor Carl Stotz the founder of Little League Baseball. In addition to the river, Carl E. Stotz Memorial Little League Bridge crosses Via Bella, the street parallel to the river, I-180, and the Lycoming Valley Railroad (LVRR) on the Williamsport side, and the Norfolk Southern Railway on the South Williamsport side. Participants in the ribbon- cutting ceremony rode to it in restored passenger cars on the LVRR line. The LVRR track was moved several feet south to accommodate the new bridge. As of summer 2008, roadwork on the project is complete, but some final touches are still planned for the site. The Court Street roundabout will be the site of a negative relief sculpture depicting scenes from the history of Williamsport and Lycoming County, and will serve as a \\"welcome portal\\" to the city. The new bridge has pedestrian ramps to the flood control levee on the north bank of the river. This will be developed into a \\"river walk\\" attraction. The final cost of the new bridge and associated construction is expected to be $67 million, about 12% over the original budget.

The abbey, established in 1175, is one of the largest Christian architectural complexes in the world and is considered a masterpiece of Baroque Silesian architecture. Description The area of the roofs is about 25,000 square metres. The fa√ßade, with a length of , is the longest in Europe after that of El Escorial in Spain. In the crypts are 98 well-preserved mummies of Silesian dukes. Built over centuries, the abbey - the biggest Cistercian abbey in the world - is currently rated in the highest class (\\"0\\") of landmarks of the world's cultural heritage. Abbey history The abbey is situated near a ford across the Odra river, where a Benedictine monastery and church of Saint James may have been established about 1150, but had already been abandoned before 1163. At this time the area belonged to the Duchy of Silesia, bequeathed by Duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth of Poland to his eldest son W≈Çadys≈Çaw II in 1138. In a fratricidal conflict of the Polish Piast dynasty, W≈Çadys≈Çaw was expelled by his younger brother and fled to Altenburg in the Holy Roman Empire. With the aid by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, however, his sons were restored to their Silesian heritage in 1163. W≈Çadys≈Çaw's eldest son, Duke Boles≈Çaw I the Tall, had spent several years in German exile. When he assumed the rule of Lower Silesia, he invited Cistercian monks from Pforta Abbey on the Saale River (in present-day Thuringia) and settled them in LubiƒÖ≈º as the first of their order in Silesia. The first monastery complex was under construction up to 1175, when Duke Boles≈Çaw I issued the official foundation charter at Grodziec Castle. Through drainage works the monks reclaimed land in the swampy environs of the monastery, implemented three-field crop rotation and laid out vineyards. Their efforts were successful and marked the beginning of the medieval German Ostsiedlung to Silesia. About 1200 the abbey church was rebuilt, at that time the first Brick Gothic building in the region. When Duke Boles≈Çaw I died in 1201, he was buried here. The rise of Leubus continued under the rule of his son Duke Henry I the Bearded and his consort Hedwig of Andechs. In 1202 the couple established Trzebnica Abbey, which in 1220 became a daughter house of Leubus by order of Pope Honorius III. It was followed by the establishment in 1222 of Mogi≈Ça Abbey (nowadays part of Nowa Huta) in Lesser Poland and Henryk√≥w Abbey in 1227. In 1249 the monks of Leubus took over the former Augustinian abbey of Kamieniec and in 1256 even established a monastery at Byszewo in Kuyavia, relocated to Koronowo in 1288. From 1249 to 1844, the place held town privileges. In 1327 the Silesian duke Henry VI the Good declared himself a vassal of King John of Bohemia, and when he died without male heirs in 1335, his lands including Leubus fell to the Kingdom of Bohemia. The monastery complex was devastated by the Hussite Wars, and furthermore the monks were expelled by warlike Duke Jan II the Mad in 1492, who turned the abbey into a hunting lodge. The Cistercians were not able to return until Jan II retired to Frankfurt an der Oder in Brandenburg. In the 16th century the abbey had to deal with the Protestant Reformation and the inheritance of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown by the Austrian House of Habsburg. During the Thirty Years' War, Leubus was occupied and plundered by Swedish troops in 1638. The painter Michael Willmann, after his conversion to the Catholic Church, was patronized by the abbey from about 1660 till his death in 1706. The Cistercians were expelled from LubiƒÖ≈º in 1810 by King Frederick William III of Prussia. During World War II, the buildings of the former abbey were used for secret research laboratories and manufacturing facilities, among other things for the development of radar components (by Telefunken), housed a company named \\"Schlesische Werkst√§tten Dr. F√ºrstenau & Co., G.m.b.H.\\", and then saw production of engines for V1 and V2 rockets (using prisoners for labour). At the end of the war, the former abbey housed soldiers of the Red Army, and then a Russian military psychiatric hospital, with significant damage (e.g., wooden furnishings were burned in stoves). Decades of neglect followed. Since 1989, the abbey has been under renovation and has become a significant tourist destination. As of 2020, the renovation is not yet complete.

Landscape. Vitosha Nature Park website.) is a rock landform resulting from the erosion of particular rock varieties caused by freezing-thawing cycles in periglacial conditions during the last Ice Age. The actual formation of stone runs involved five processes: weathering, solifluction, frost heaving, frost sorting, and washing.Stone, Phillip. Periglacial Princes Street - 52¬∞ South. The Edinburgh Geologist. Issue No 35, 2000. The stone runs are essentially different from moraines, rock glaciers, and rock flows or other rock phenomena involving the actual flow of rock blocks under stress that is sufficient to break down the cement or to cause crushing of the angularities and points of the boulders.Harris, Stuart A. Climatic Zonality of Periglacial Landforms in Mountain Areas. Arctic, Vol. 47, No. 2, June 1994, pp. 184-92. By contrast, the stone run boulders are fixed quite stably, providing for safer climbing and crossing of the run. Stone runs are accumulations of boulders with no finer material between them. In the Falklands, they occur on slopes of between 1 and 10 degrees, and are the product of mass-movement and stone sorting during past periods of cold climate. They everywhere occur in association with poorly sorted, clay-rich solifluction deposits.ALDISS, D T, and EDWARDS, E J. 1999. The Geology of the Falkland Islands. British Geological Survey Technical Report, WC/99/10. Geographic distribution Vitosha Mountain, Bulgaria. The Falkland Islands and Vitosha Mountain, Bulgaria, both have an abundance of large stone runs. The highly specific combination of particular climatic conditions and rock varieties that existed there during the Quaternary explains both the formation of stone runs in those two territories and their absence in areas with otherwise comparable nature conditions. For instance, while the present Falklands climate is quite similar to that of Scotland, the latter was completely glacial rather than periglacial during the relevant period, which would not allow for the formation of stone runs. On the other hand, due to geological and other specifics of the southern temperate and sub- Antarctic territories with climatic history similar to that of the Falklands (Prince Edward Islands, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Macquarie Island, Campbell Islands, or nearby Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia), none of them features landforms comparable to the Falklands stone runs.Hall, Kevin.Review of Present and Quaternary periglacial processes and landforms of the maritime and sub-Antarctic region. South African Journal of Science, Vol. 98, January/February 2002. pp. 71-81. Likewise, the specific geology of Vitosha accounts for the fairly restricted examples of similar landforms in other Bulgarian or indeed Balkan mountains with comparable climatic record among which Vitosha is one of the smallest, extending just by . However, even on that small territory the stone runs exist along with screes and other rock landforms, suggesting that the right periglacial conditions and rock composition are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the formation of stone runs.Vitosha Nature Park: Management Plan 2005-2014. Ministry of Environment and Waters, Sofia, 2005. (in Bulgarian). Other examples of stone runs occur in England, including at the Stiperstones, Shropshire.GOUDIE, A S, and PIGGOTT, N R. 1981. Quartzite tors, stone stripes, and slopes at the Stiperstones, Shropshire, England. Biuletyn Periglacjalny, Vol. 28, 47-56.CLARK, R. 1994. Tors, rock platforms and debris slopes at Stiperstones, Shropshire, England. Field Studies, Vol. 8, 451 - 472. They are also known in Pennsylvania.SMITH, H T U. 1953. The Hickory Run boulder field, Carbon County, Pennsylvania. American Journal of Science, Vol. 251, 625-642. Small examples are probably very widespread where solifluction deposits contain large concentrations of frost-resistant rock blocks. Falklands stone runs Stone runs on Weddell Island, Falkland Islands; Circum Peak and New Year Cove from Mount Weddell. The Falklands stone runs are made up of hard quartzite blocks. They are more widespread and larger on East Falkland, especially in the Wickham Heights area where the largest of them extend over 5 km in length. Those on West Falkland and the minor islands are fewer in number and of smaller dimensions. Darwin's \\"great valley of fragments\\", subsequently renamed Princes Street Stone Run after Edinburgh's Princes Street that was cobbled at the time, occupies a 4 km long and 400 m wide shallow valley trending east- west. The feature is situated off the road to Port Louis, some 20 km northwest of Stanley.Andersson, J.G. 1907. Contributions to the geology of the Falkland Islands.

Stone runs in the Falkland Islands. Geology Today. Vol. 12, 1996. pp. 151-54. An early description of the Falklands stone runs was given in Antoine-Joseph Pernety‚Äôs account of his exploration of the islands during the 1763-64 French expedition under Louis Antoine de Bougainville, which established the Port Saint Louis settlement on East Falkland. While crossing the neck between Baye Accaron (Berkeley Sound) and Baye Marville (Salvador Water) he described in detail two particular stone features he called ‚ÄòCity Gates‚Äô and ‚ÄòAmphitheatre‚Äô: Pernety's observations were continued by young Charles Darwin, who visited the Falklands in 1833 and 1834: Vitosha stone rivers Stone river at Malak Rezen Peak, Vitosha Mountain. The Vitosha stone rivers (), located in Bulgaria, are situated in the middle and upper mountain belts at elevation over 1,000 m above sea level. Among the largest ones are those on the Subalpine plateaus surrounding the summit Cherni Vrah (2290 m), and in the upper courses of the mountain's rivers, extending over 2 km at the Zlatnite Mostove (‚ÄòGolden Bridges‚Äô) site in the upper course of Vladayska River, and over 1 km in the case of Boyanska, Bistritsa, and Struma Rivers. Golyamata Gramada (Big Pile) Stone River in Vitoshka Bistritsa River valley is up to 300 m wide, and other stone run formations sprawl even wider on the mountain slopes, notably the ‚Äòstone sea‚Äô at the northern foot of Kamen Del Peak. Some boulders are several dozen to over three hundred cubic metres in volume, and sixty to several hundred tons weight. While Vitosha was known already to Thucydides, Aristotle, and Pliny the Elder in Antiquity, its first modern geological survey was made as late as 1836 by the German-French-Austrian scientist Ami Bou√© who incidentally had studied medicine at Edinburgh University just a few years before Charles Darwin did. Since Bou√©, it took several decades of argument to conclude that Vitosha stone rivers were not true glacial moraines as some believed.Bou√©, Ami. La Turquie d'Europe; observations sur la g√©ographie, la g√©ologie, l'histoire naturelle, etc. 4 vols. Paris: A. Bertrand, 1840. 2247 pp. (in French). Exploited in the past as a source of cobblestone material for Sofia‚Äôs streets, nowadays the stone rivers are protected by law. Special permission has been granted in exceptional cases for the removal of some material for sculpture artwork. As a nature park situated right by the outskirts of Sofia (Cherni Vrah itself being 16 km away from the central square of Sofia), Vitosha is a major tourist destination. Some 1.5 million people from dozens of nations visit the mountain annually, and the stone rivers feature high on the list of tourist attractions.Vitosha Map. Vitosha Nature Park website.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways.  Constructed in Kearny, New Jersey as Wamsutta  Wamsutta‚Äîa screw steamer built in 1853 at Hoboken, New Jersey‚Äîwas purchased by the Union Navy on 20 September 1861 at New York City from H. Haldrege; and commissioned on 14 March 1862, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant William L. Stone in command.  Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockade  Wamsutta was assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and arrived in Port Royal, South Carolina, harbor on 14 April 1862. The next day, she received orders to report to Comdr. Edmund Lanier, in Alabama, for blockade and reconnaissance duty in St. Simon's Sound, Georgia. = Battle of the Riceboro River = On 27 April, while on an expedition to destroy a brig believed to be near Dorchester, Georgia, Wamsutta and Potamska engaged a company of dismounted Confederate cavalry on Woodville Island in the Riceboro River. The battle lasted 40 minutes. Wamsutta suffered two casualties and received superficial damage to her port side. On 8 May, again accompanied by Potomska, Wamsutta proceeded to Darien, Georgia, to capture stored lighthouse machinery. However, a search of the town on the 9th found nothing, and the two gunboats withdrew that evening. Wamsutta remained off Darien, blockading Doboy Sound, Georgia. On 4 August 1862, Wamsutta departed Doboy Sound to blockade St. Catherine's Sound, Georgia. There, she and Brazileira captured the schooner Defiance on 19 September. On 8 November, a broken air pump forced Wamsutta to Port Royal, South Carolina, for repairs. Ultimately, she proceeded to the New York Navy Yard where she was decommissioned on 3 December 1862. = Recommissioned and returned to duty with the blockade = Wamsutta was recommissioned there on 2 February 1863 and returned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, arriving off Port Royal on the 13th. Five days later, she proceeded to Doboy Sound to tow Fernandina into position to blockade the entrance to the sound. = Operating in the Georgia sounds = On the 28th, Wamsutta was ordered to Sapelo Sound, Georgia, to relieve Potomska and remained until ordered to Wassaw Sound, Georgia, on 29 March to relieve Marblehead. By 1 May, Wamsutta lay off Charleston, South Carolina, but spent the remainder of May and the first two weeks of June repairing and re-provisioning in Port Royal. Wamsutta arrived back off Sapelo Sound on 15 June 1863. Four days later, she was relieved by Midnight and ordered to proceed to Doboy Sound to relieve Fernandina. After serving there for most of the summer, Wamsutta headed north on 5 September for repairs in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was decommissioned there on 14 September 1863. = Reactivated after repairs and returned to the blockade = Wamsutta was reactivated on 24 April 1864 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was ordered back to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She arrived in Port Royal harbor on 6 May and was assigned to blockade duty off Georgetown, South Carolina. = Capturing and burning the British runner Rose = On 3 June, she chased the British steamer Rose aground there and burned the blockade runner. On 9 June, while reconnoitering Confederate island batteries scattered about Winjah Bay, South Carolina, she drew sporadic fire from shore batteries. On 14 July, Wamsutta returned to duty in Charleston and carried out frequent operations against Confederate vessels from her anchorage off Morris Island, South Carolina. On 22 October, she helped chase the blockade runner Flora aground near Fort Moultrie, South Carolina. On 5 December 1864, she drove off an unidentified blockade runner attempting to slip into port. On 4 February 1865, Wamsutta and Potomska ran another schooner aground, but the crew of the potential prize burned the ship before the Federals could take possession of her. Finally, two days later, Wamsutta turned back a blockade runner attempting to reach Charleston.  End-of-war operations and decommissioning  Late in April, Wamsutta was reassigned to duty off St. Simon's Island, Georgia. She remained there through May and sailed for the Portsmouth Navy Yard (Kittery, Maine) early in June. She was decommissioned at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 29 June 1865 and was sold at public auction there on 20 July to Otis Seabury.

The composition of Earth's paleoatmosphere can be inferred today from the study of the abundance of proxy materials such as iron oxides, charcoal and the stomatal density of fossil leaves in geological deposits. Although today's atmosphere is dominated by nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), and argon (about 1%), the pre- biological atmosphere is thought to have been a highly reducing atmosphere, having virtually no free oxygen, virtually no argon, which is generated by the radioactive decay of 40K, and to have been dominated by nitrogen, carbon dioxide and methane. Appreciable concentrations of free oxygen were probably not present until about 2,500 million years ago (Ma). After the Great Oxygenation Event, quantities of oxygen produced as a by-product of photosynthesis by cyanobacteria or blue-green algae began to exceed the quantities of chemically reducing materials, notably dissolved iron. By the beginning of the Cambrian period 541 Ma, free oxygen concentrations had increased sufficiently to enable the evolution of multicellular organisms. Following the subsequent appearance, rapid evolution and radiation of land plants, which covered much of the Earth's land surface, beginning about 450 Ma, oxygen concentrations reached and later exceeded current values during the early Carboniferous, when atmospheric carbon dioxide was drawn down below current concentrations.RA Berner (1998) The carbon cycle and over Phanerozoic time: the role of land plants.

This may have contributed to the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse during the Moscovian and Kasimovian ages of the Pennsylvanian subperiod. Indirect measurements Geological studies of ancient rock formations can give information on paleoatmospheric composition, pressure, density, etc. at specific points in Earth's history. = Density and pressure= A 2012 study looked at the imprints made by falling raindrops onto freshly deposited volcanic ash, laid down in the Archean Eon 2,700 Ma in the Ventersdorp Supergroup, South Africa. They linked the terminal velocity of the raindrops directly to the air density of the paleoatmosphere and showed that it had less than twice the density of the modern atmosphere, and likely had similar if not lower density.Som, Sanjoy M., et al. \\"Air density 2.7 billion years ago limited to less than twice modern levels by fossil raindrop imprints.\\" Nature 484.7394 (2012): 359-362. A similar study in 2016 looked at the size distribution of gas bubbles in basaltic lava flows that solidified at sea level also during the Archean (~2,700 Ma). They found an atmospheric pressure of only 0.23 ¬± 0.23 bar (23 kPa).Som, Sanjoy M., et al. \\"Earth's air pressure 2.7 billion years ago constrained to less than half of modern levels.\\" Nature Geoscience (2016). Both results contradict theories that suggest the Archean was kept warm during the Faint Young Sun period by extremely high levels of carbon dioxide or nitrogen. =Oxygen content= A 2016 study performed mass spectrometry on air bubbles trapped inside rock salt deposited 813 Myr ago. They detected an oxygen content of 10.9%, much higher than had been expected from indirect measures. This suggested the Great Oxygenation Event may have happened much earlier than previously thought.Nigel J.F.

It connected the villages of Dryburgh and St. Boswells (part of a ribbon of settlements including Newtown St. Boswells), across the River Tweed. A crossing had existed here for centuries, originally with a ferry service. The bridge had been commissioned by David Stewart Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan, an eccentric Scottish aristocrat who later died in Dryburgh. It was long. At the time, the cable-stayed type of bridge was undergoing a period of rapid growth in popularity. The Earl opened the completed bridge on 1 August 1817, but in January 1818 it collapsed. After a redesign a replacement was built, but this too collapsed in 1838, by which time the Earl had been dead for several years. The 1818 collapse, together with that of a slightly shorter bridge across the Saale River in Germany in 1824, caused the reputation of cable-stayed bridges to decline rapidly, and despite a history dating back to the 17th century, the design was almost completely abandoned for over a century, with suspended-deck suspension bridges gaining favour. Later research in the 1930s, and experience with reconstruction after the Second World War, demonstrated that with sound design, cable-stayed bridges are not without advantages, and the first modern design, the Str√∂msund Bridge in Sweden, was completed in 1955. Very shortly after the 1818 collapse (between 1819 and 1820) another bridge, the Union Bridge, was built some downstream. It was an iron suspended-deck suspension bridge, the longest in the world upon its completion. A third Dryburgh Suspension Bridge was built in 1872 to replace the 1838 loss.

She studied the effect of environmental conditions such as heat, radiation and pollution on metabolic activity and genetic mutability in the fruit fly Drosophila. From the late 1980s, Lamb collaborated with Eva Jablonka, researching and writing on the inheritance of epigenetic variations, and in 2005 they co-authored the book Evolution in Four Dimensions, considered by some to be in the vanguard of an ongoing revolution within evolutionary biology. Work on evolutionary themes Building on the approach of evolutionary developmental biology, and recent findings of molecular and behavioral biology, they argue the case for the transmission of not just genes per se, but heritable variations transmitted from generation to generation by whatever means. They suggest that such variation can occur at four levels. Firstly, at the established physical level of genetics. Secondly, at the epigenetic level involving variation in the ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù of given DNA strands, in which variations in DNA translation during developmental processes are subsequently transmitted during reproduction, which can then feed back into sequence modification of DNA itself. These epigenetic changes - chemical modifications and markers that change the way enzymes and regulatory proteins have access to DNA - are currently being studied to explain many non-Mendelian patterns of inheritance. The best understood mechanism is nucleotide methylation that silences a gene. Methylation can be inherited during cell division, both asexually (mitotic) during development and wound healing, but in some instances also sexually (meiotic). Methylation is linked in some instances to RNA interference, the new and emerging science of RNA regulation of gene expression. The third dimension comprises the transmission of behavioural traditions. There are for example documented cases of food preferences being passed on, by social learning, in several animal species, which remain stable from generation to generation while conditions permit. The fourth dimension is symbolic inheritance, which is unique to humans, and in which traditions are passed on ‚Äúthrough our capacity for language, and culture, our representations of how to behave, communicated by speech and writing.‚Äù In their treatment of the higher levels, Jablonka and Lamb distinguish their approach from the banalities of evolutionary psychology, of \\"memes\\", and even from Chomskyian ideas of universal grammar. They argue that there are constant interactions between the levels - epigenetic, behavioural and even symbolic inheritance mechanisms also produce selection pressures on DNA-based inheritance and can, in some cases, even help direct DNA changes themselves - so \\"evolving evolution\\". To liven their text, they use thought experiments and dialogue with a sceptical enquirer, one IM-Ifcha Mistraba, Aramaic, they say, for \\"the opposite conjecture\\". Since publication of this book, Lamb and Jablonka have responded to critics, citing evidence which affirms their view that evolutionary change is facilitated by all types of hereditary information that they have identified: genetic, epigenetic, behavioural and cultural. They claim that their approach broadens the definitions of terms such as ‚Äòunits of heredity‚Äô, ‚Äòunits of evolution‚Äô, and ‚Äòunits of selection‚Äô, and they maintain that ‚Äòinformation‚Äô can be a useful concept if it is defined in terms of its effects on the receiver. They concede that evolutionary theory is not undergoing a paradigm shift or Kuhnian revolution, but argue that the incorporation of new data and ideas about hereditary variation, and the role of development in generating it, is leading to a very different version of Darwinism than the gene-centred one which has dominated evolutionary thinking in the second half of the twentieth century. In 2008, Jablonka and Lamb published the paper Soft inheritance: Challenging the Modern Synthesis which claimed there is evidence for Lamarckian epigenetic control systems causing evolutionary changes and the mechanisms underlying epigenetic inheritance can also lead to saltational changes that reorganize the epigenome.Eva Jablonka, Marion J. Lamb. (2008). Soft Inheritance: Challenging the Modern Synthesis. Genetics and Molecular Biology. 31: 393. Thomas Dickens and Qazi Rahman have written epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection and do not challenge the modern evolutionary synthesis.

The first wave took place between 1850 and 1880, when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) invited all the new converts, who were mostly from Northern Europe, to ‚Äúgather in Zion.‚Äù The second one occurred between 1880 and 1920 and involved people from all over the world. This happened in connection with the booming railroad and mining industries. The third one, after World War II, was slower and it is still happening to this day. It involves mostly people from Mexico and Latin America. All these peoples brought with them the cultures of their countries of origin. National and ethnic cultures are a big part of diversity in any state and city, because they are the result of thousands of years of traditions and civilization. There is no easy substitute for these cultural treasures. In today's always increasing globalized economy, people are better prepared for its challenges if they are exposed to a variety of different cultures.Cultural competence Demographic data According to 2000 official estimates,Official Census data the population of the state of Utah was 2,470,000. * The percentages of ethnic groups are as follows: Asian 2.4%, American Indian 1.7%, Black 1.3%, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 0.9%. This is a total of 6.3%. * The percentages of the major national groups are as follows: German: 11.5%, Hispanic (mostly Mexicans) 10.4%, Danish: 6.5%, Irish 5.9%, Scottish 4.4%, Swedish 4.3% Italian 2.1%. This is a total of 45.1. * Other national groups, such as people from Bosnia, France, Russia, Sudan, Venezuela and so on, total 12.8%. * The percentage of the English and American (mostly of English ancestry) population is respectively 29% and 6.8%, for a total of 35.8% From this data it can be inferred that the ancestry of a little over half of the population of Utah belongs either to the ethnic groups or, for the most part, to the non-English speaking national groups. Ethnic and national groups Scholars have never reached stable consensus on the distinction between ethnic and national groups, because their meaning can change according to political opinions. Nationality and ethnicity refer both to a combination of race and customs. However, \\"ethnic group\\", especially in the United States, is linked more with people of common genetic origin, or race. Therefore, Asians, African Americans, and Native Americans (or American Indians) are typically associated with the ethnic groups because of their evident physical traits. \\"National group\\", instead, is linked more with the differences in language and customs. Therefore, it usually refers to Caucasians belonging to nation-states with specific cultures, such as Russians, Germans, Turks, and so on. ‚ÄúHispanic‚Äù or ‚ÄúLatino‚Äù people are often placed in an intermediate category, because they are mostly (mixed), due to the diffused intermarriage between Caucasians from Spain and Native Americans. The two terms are fairly vague and they can often be interchangeable. In this article current American terminology is mostly adopted, but readers should be aware of the various points of view. Ethnic groups =African Americans= There were about sixty blacks in 1850 and the majority of them worked in farms. In 1900 blacks increased to 677 because of the railroad construction companies. By the 1890s two churches were already established in Salt Lake City, the Trinity African Methodist and the Calvary Baptist. Discrimination against blacks was in that period pretty common. They had limited access to public positions and good professions. Many young blacks emigrated in other states because of that situation. Interracial marriage was illegal. There was even a lynching episode in Price, Utah, in 1925. A chapter of the NAACP was established in Salt Lake in 1919. This situation of discrimination started to improve in the 1960s, as a result of national campaigns for equality. In the past, the Utah State Legislature has not been active in promoting civil rights. In 1976, the Reverend Robert Harris, a Democrat from Ogden, became the first African American elected to the Utah Legislature. In 1978 the LDS Church allowed blacks to be ordained to the priesthood. Since those years the situation of African Americans in Utah has improved. According to the 2000 Census, there are about 30,000 blacks in Utah. This is 1.3 percent of the total population.Ronald G. Coleman article in Utah History Encyclopedia, by Allen Kent Powell, University Press, 1994, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah * Organizations. NAACP Salt Lake Branch. Black Affairs, Ethnic Office, Utah Government. =Native Americans = Utes 1878 The most important Utah tribes today, the Utes, the Shoshone, the Goshute and the Paiutes are the descendants of the so-called Numic population who settled in Utah and bordering states around 1200 a. D. They displaced populations like the Fremont and the Anasazi who had lived in that territory for several centuries, starting from about 400 a. D.\\"The Earliest Peoples\\", and \\"The Indians of Utah Territory\\", in Utah's History, ed. by Richard Poll, et al. (1989) When the Mormon pioneers arrived in Utah in 1847, these tribes numbered about 20,000 people. Notwithstanding several programs aimed to maintain their survival, for several years they lost control of their ancestral territory. In 1960 the tribes‚Äô population was down to around 7,000 people. Following the implementation of more favorable federal and state programs, in 1970 their population increased to 11,000 and in 1980 returned toward the same figure of 1847, about 19,000. Today (2007) many of Utah's American Indians are experiencing a better balance between tribal life and coexistence with the dominant society.Fred A. Conetah, A History of the Northern Ute People (1982) =Chinese= Chinese workers started to arrive in Utah around 1860 in connection with the railroad construction companies. They were very appreciated as skillful and dependable workers. After the railroads were built, at the beginning of 1900 some found occupations in the new mining industry and others dedicated themselves to independent businesses such as laundries, restaurants and mini markets. They lived in their humble but colorful chinatowns, mostly singles without families, because they had the intention to return one day to China. Many of them had periods of hard times and experienced discrimination. For example, in 1902 the mining unions decided to boycott their businesses. The major Chinese communities before World War II were in Ogden, Salt Lake City and Park City. In 1890 there were about 500 Chinese people in Utah. This number grew a little at the beginning of 1900, but then, as a result of the Depression, in 1940 declined to about 500. After World War II it started to steadily grow. In 1970 Chinese numbered about 1.200, and in 1990 their population increased to over 5,000 people.Don C. Conley, \\"The Pioneer Chinese of Utah\\", in Helen Zeese Papanikolas, ed., The Peoples of Utah (1976) * Organizations. UOCA, Utah Organization of Chinese Americans. =Japanese= Similar to the Chinese, the Japanese started to arrive in Utah in the 1860s as laborers in the railroad companies. By 1900, according to the census, over 400 Japanese people were living in Utah. Their number grew in the next twenty years as a result of the booming mining industry. In 1910 their number was 2,100 and in 1920 they reached almost 3,000 people. The most important areas where they were located were Ogden, Salt Lake City and Carbon County. Due to this significant population a newspaper was started, a Buddhist Temple, and a Christian church were built near Japan Town in Salt Lake City. All three are still in existence today (2007). Instead, Japan Town was razed to build the Salt Palace. A similar destiny had China Town in Plum Alley. This short period of prosperity was followed by the anti- immigration laws of 1924. Discrimination worsened when Japanese children were denied access to activities in the public schools. The really big blow came with World War II, when almost all Japanese were segregated in Camps in remote areas of Utah, such as Topaz. Their cemetery was vandalized by paranoid people. Many Japanese from California were also sent to the Camps in Utah. Some of them remained after the end of the war. Because of this, according to the 1950 Census, Utah's Japanese population almost doubled. Since the 1950s the Government has acknowledged the bad treatment suffered by the Japanese Americans and has offered some form of reparation. Today the Japanese in Utah continue to keep their national traditions while actively contributing to the local community.Helen Zeese Papanikolas and Alice Kasai, \\"Japanese Life in Utah\\", in Helen Zeese Papanikolas, ed., The Peoples of Utah (1976) * Organizations. Salt Lake Buddhist Church, Japanese Church of Christ, Utah Nippo newspaper, Japanese-American Citizen's League. National groups from Africa =Sudan ‚Äì Sudanese= As of 2005, there were about 2,000 Sudanese in Utah. Most of these were recent immigrants. They included young families with children and young singles. They started to arrive in 1999 as refugees, and many are still coming, because of the war going on in Sudan between the Muslims of the North and the Christians of the South. For them life in Utah is better and they especially enjoy the security, far from the dangers of the war. They live mostly in Salt Lake County, with concentration in Salt Lake City and West Valley. They plan to remain in the USA. Most of them are working and many are also studying at college. They have found jobs at convenience stores like 7-Eleven or in warehouses. Several of the Sudanese women are attending school at Horizonte High School to obtain the skills necessary to start their own businesses. Almost all of them are renting their homes and apartments. The official language in Sudan is Arabic, but most of them know English, also because of the proximity with Kenya. Some of those not from the cities speak their dialects instead of Arabic, but they also know some English. Since they are mostly from South Sudan, they are in great majority Christians (95%), and the rest are Muslims. They are very religious and meet every Sunday at church. * Organizations. Sudanese Association of Utah, a 501c3 non-profit organization. National groups from Latin America =Hispanics= Hispanics (or Latino) are so called because of their mainly Spanish (or Portuguese) cultural heritage. Genetically, their heritage is also, for a good part, American Indian. Consequently, the immigrants from the various states of Central and South America are grouped under the term \\"Hispanics.\\" =Mexico - Mexicans= About 80 percents of the Hispanics in Utah come from Mexico, and the rest from other countries of Central America and South America. After World War II they have become the fastest growing group of immigrants, and they are the largest of the recent wave of immigrants. According to 2005 data, they represent 8.3 percent (eighty percent of 10.4 percent) of the state's population. This is a big jump from the 3.9 percent (eighty percent of 4.9 percent) of the 1990 census.State of Utah official data The first European to explore Utah was Spanish friar Father Escalante and Francisco Dominguez in 1778. Until 1848 Utah was part of Mexico. No permanent Mexican settlements were ever established, but the Spanish Trail was built in the state's southern boundaries, and several geographic names remain. The first Hispanics to settle in Utah were ranchers coming from New Mexico and Colorado who found jobs in the southwestern part of the state, near Monticello in the 1880s. By 1900 a good number of families lived in that area, some of them on their own homesteads. At the same time a good number of Mexicans immigrated to the Salt Lake and Ogden area to work in the railroad and mining companies. They associated with the organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. In the 1920s a congregation called La Rama Mexicana was established by the LDS Church, to cater to the Hispanics of Central and South America converted by the Mormon missionaries. Social organizations of mutual aid were founded also by the immigrants. These included the Cruz Azul (Blue Cross) similar to the Red Cross, and Union y Patria (union and fatherland). After World War II the Centro Civico Mexicano was started in Salt Lake City, and still exists (2007). Today, a good number of Mexicans are well integrated in Utah, but many social problems remain. High rates of school dropouts, of unemployment, and of poverty are still too common among Mexican immigrants.Vicente V. Mayer, Jr., Utah: A Hispanic History (1975); Orlando A. Rivera, Chicanos in Utah (1976) * Organizations. Centro Civico Mexicano, Salt Lake City National groups from Europe =Basque= Most Basques immigrated to Utah at the end of the 1800s. Their major occupation was at first shepherding on big ranches. They were considered the most reliable ranchers in the West. In fact, shepherding had been for centuries their profession in their rugged land of origin, between France and Spain. Many of them went to work in the mines when they were opened at the beginning of 1900. Today the Basques number just a few hundred in Utah, but they are still very dedicated to their ancestral culture.Lisa Carricaburu article in Utah History Encyclopedia, by Allen Kent Powell, University Press, 1994, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah * Organizations. Utah Basque Club, member of the North American Basque Organization. Utah'ko Triskalariak Basque Dancers, a traditional folk dance troupe. =Spaniards= Spaniards were the first Europeans to visit Utah. After visiting, steady waves of migrants from Spain and New Spain continued throughout the next century. Many Spaniards in the 18th century immigrated to the northern region of Utah. Many lived in ranches and in small villages. =Denmark - Danes= The pattern of immigration of Danes in Utah mirrors closely the British immigration: both came in big numbers the early years, and both were converts to Mormonism. The difference was that the Danes were not native English speakers. By 1869 about 17,000 Danes had come to Utah. This number was inferior only to the British. In the 1890 census 10 percent of the Utah population had Danish connections. This trend remained unchanged for many years until 1970. In the 2000 census the percentage had dropped to 6.5. Most of the Danes were farmers from Northern Jutland and settled in the agricultural counties of Box Elder and Cache in the north of Utah, and Sevier and Sanpete in the south. Although LDS Church leaders encouraged assimilation, and participation in English speaking wards, a number of language based organizations flourished. In 1876 a periodical in Danish, Norwegian and sometimes Swedish, appeared, and lasted until 1935. Several Danes soon became prominent in all sectors of civil and ecclesiastical activities, but for most of those of the first generation the language barriers were difficult to overcome.William Mulder, Homeward to Zion (1957) * Organizations. Danish consulate =Finland - Finns= Finnish immigrants (also called Finns or Finlanders) came to America in big numbers in search of better opportunities, also because their Country was engaged in a bloody war of independence against Russia. It is calculated that about 375,000 emigrated to the United States in the years around 1900. Most of them settled in the Midwest and a few came to Utah. A couple hundred, according to the 1900 census, were living in Utah in the mining districts, especially in Carbon County. They were happy when they could recreate a Little Finland in their communities, with a Finn hall, a boarding house, and especially a sauna. Their community received a big blow when sixty of them died in 1900 in the Scofield mine disaster at the Winter Quarters mine near Scofield, Utah. Many of the surviving Finns left Utah, but a few remained. Some of them, like John Westerdahl became successful entrepreneurs. Today the Finnish group is small, but is still very active in keeping their ancestral culture alive.Yvonne R. Lockwood, \\"The Sauna: An Expression of Finnish-American Identity\\", Western Folklore 36 (1977); A. William Hoglund, Finnish Immigrants in America, 1880-1920 (1960) * Organizations. Finlandia Society, Salt Lake City. =Greece - Greeks= The Greeks, along with the Italians, are the largest Mediterranean community in Utah. They immigrated to Utah at the beginning of the 1900s in connection with the development of the railroad and of the mining industries. These industries were not attractive to local Mormons. According to the 1910 census, the Greeks numbered about 4,000, but probably much more. Greeks showed high appreciation of their religious heritage by building their first Greek Orthodox Church near downtown. At that time they were mostly single men. Their work was dangerous and they wanted to be buried according to their religious traditions. Over one hundred funerals were performed in the period between 1910 and 1924 for men killed by work related accidents. At the beginning these men hoped to return to their homeland, but then they decided to remain and started to marry \\"picture wives.\\" With the large increase of immigrants, businesses related to their national culture were started, such as coffeehouses, bakeries, and grocery stores with Greek products. They also opened a school dedicated to teaching Greek language and culture to their children. When war was declared by Greece against Turkey in 1912, about 200 men went to fight for their country. All these elements were considered by the Americans as a clear sign that the Greeks had no intention of assimilating. Anti Greek sentiment was well spread in the 1920s. A severe episode of lynching happened when a Greek gave a ride to an American girl. World War II brought prosperity to the community because of many government related jobs. Almost 600 men served in the Army, 22 died in combat. After the war two more churches were opened, and today the Greek community is thriving. The Greek festival organized by the Holy Trinity Church in Salt Lake City attracts over 100,000 people every September.Helen Zeeze Papanikolas, Toil and Rage in a New Land: The Greek Immigrants in Utah (1970); and \\"The Exiled Greeks\\", in Helen Zeese Papanikolas, The Peoples of Utah (1976) * Organizations. Hellenic Cultural Center of Salt Lake City. =Germany ‚Äì Germans= Of the 143 Mormon pioneers who first entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, one of them was German. German immigration in Utah was closely connected with the Mormon ‚ÄùGathering in Zion,‚Äù but a small percentage had connection with the mining and railroad industries, and a few with the Jewish community. The most famous of this early immigration was Karl G. Maeser, founder of Brigham Young University. By 1910 the number of Germans reached over 5,000. They had to solve a dilemma when the United States declared war on Germany in World War I, but the great majority sustained their new country. During World War II about 7,000 German soldiers were kept as prisoners of war in Utah, mostly in Ogden. Some of them remained after the war ended. Also, about 3,000 German Mormons immigrated to Utah in the aftermath of the war. Famous Germans in Utah include a long list of musicians, architects, painters, scholars, and Church leaders. German language and traditions have always been kept alive with various organizations and a newspaper, the Salt Lake Beobachter, that ended publication in the 1930s after forty years of activity. Today similar organizations continue to prosper. There is a radio program and a choir Harmonie. A German American Society of Utah was organized in 1983. Around 100,000 tourists from Germany visit Utah every year.Allan Kent Powell, Splinters of a Nation: German Prisoners of War in Utah (1989); Utah Historical Quarterly (Fall 1984) =Great Britain - British= The immigrants in Utah from the British Isles were different from most of the others for several reasons. They came early, they came in big numbers, they were mostly Mormons. Particularly, they were English speaking, and they soon became part of the leadership both in the LDS Church and in the civil society. Many arrived as part of the initial Mormon migration to Utah, and a big influx continued for the next twenty years. The 1870 census shows that about 24 percent of Utah population were born in Great Britain. If their American born children are included in this count, their percentage could almost reach fifty percent. An even higher proportion of British is reflected in their participation in the leadership of the LDS Church. For example, the successor of Brigham Young as President of the Church was John Taylor, a Briton. The same situation happened in the government and in the business sectors. Being of the same language, culture and religion of the Mormon leadership greatly helped them to completely integrate to early Utah culture. On the other side, British immigrants greatly helped American Mormons to start the development of the new land, in the critical first years before the arrival of the railroad. Their immigration continues today, even though at much lower rates. According to the 1980 census, 3.2 percent of Utahns were born in the British Isles.P. A. M. Taylor, Expectations Westward: The Mormons and the Emigration of their British Converts in the Nineteenth Century (1966) * Organizations. Cambrian Society, Caledonia Society, Scottish social club. =Italy ‚Äì Italians= Price is the governmental seat of Carbon County and the economic center for the county and East-Central Utah A small group of about 60 Waldensians came to Utah in the 1860s from Piedmont, Italy, following Mormon missionary efforts by Lorenzo Snow. They were followed by the big \\"wave\\" of the 1880-1920. They came by the thousands, and soon in the west side of Salt Lake City a Little Italy was formed, with a cluster of stores where Italian cuisine and merchandise were sold. Italian presence was mainly in Salt Lake County, in Carbon County, and in Ogden. Several local Italian newspapers, such as Il Minatore (the miner) and La Scintilla (the sparkle) were keeping the new immigrants informed. The Italians who came to Utah were mostly Catholic, and were taken care of by a parish priest, Monsignor Giovannoni, sent from Italy to ease the language barriers they encountered. The Italian Vice Consul Fortunato Anselmo, from Calabria, helped them with government documents and bureaucracy. During World War II about 4,000 Italian soldiers were kept as prisoners in Utah camps. Some of them remained after the war. The first generation of immigrants, as usually happens, had to accept mostly menial jobs, but the next generations have shown that the Italians have adjusted very well to the new country. Italian Americans can be found in all professions and businesses, in percentages similar to those of any national group. The first Italian to become state legislator was Frank Bonacci, in the 1930s. Today Italian immigration in Utah has practically come to an end. An exception is represented by a few converts to the LDS Church.Philip F. Notarianni, \\"Italianita in Utah: The Immigrant Experience\\", in Helen Z. Papanikolas, ed., The Peoples of Utah (1976) =Sweden ‚Äì Swedes= Most Swedes came to Utah as a result of their conversion to the LDS Church, similar to the Danes and the British.Woods, Fred E., and Nicholas J. Evans, 'Latter-day Saint Scandinavian Migration through Hull, England, 1852-1894' , BYU Studies, Volume 41, Number 4 (2002), pp. 75-102. They were in smaller numbers. According to the 1910 census about 17,000 Swedes and their children were living in Utah. This is a 4.6 percent of the state's population. They must have been fairly successful, because the 2000 census confirmed a similar 4.3 percentage. The counties with the highest rate of Swedes were Tooele, Salt Lake and Cache. Grantsville and a neighborhood in Salt Lake City had a Swedish majority. As usually happens when foreign immigrants transplant to a foreign country, they had the desire to keep their language and culture. The LDS Church encouraged them to participate in the English-speaking wards. A group of them asked instead for Swedish-speaking wards. The refusal of the church caused what was called the ‚ÄúSwedish rebellion,‚Äù of 1902, and a few people left the Church as a result of that situation. One of these ‚Äúrebels‚Äù was Johan Ahmanson, who became a state legislator in Nebraska and wrote a book against the Mormons. On the whole, the Swedish integrated very well in the new society. They prospered in the various fields of business, industry, and in the political and in the ecclesiastical institutions. The former President of the LDS Church, Thomas S. Monson, has Swedish ancestry. The most famous Swedish remains Joe Hill (Hagglund), who was a Union leader of the mining period.William Mulder, Homeward to Zion: The Mormon Migration from Scandinavia (1957); and Allan Kastrup, The Swedish Heritage in America (1975) * Organizations. Swedish Honorary Consulate of Salt Lake City. =Switzerland ‚Äì Swiss= Swiss immigrants started to come to Utah in the 1850s as a result of the proselytizing efforts of Mormon missionaries in Switzerland. The 1860 census showed the presence of 78 Swiss in Utah, and by 1910 that number reached 1,700, a considerable figure for a small country. A group of them were sent by Brigham Young to start the town of Santa Clara, near St George, and they accomplished the task in an excellent way. Another city with Swiss majority is Midway, near Heber. Swiss presence is also notable in Providence, near Logan and in other communities of Cache Valley. Typical Swiss industries like cheesemaking and watchmaking have been transplanted to Utah. Several notable Utahns are descendants of Swiss pioneers, professors, artists, musicians, businessmen and politicians. The Swiss influence in Utah is still alive today, and it becomes very visible during the Swiss Days in Midway, that attracts over 60,000 visitors every year.Douglas F. Tobler article in Utah History Encyclopedia by Allen Kent Powell, University Press, 1994, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah * Organizations. Swiss Festival of Midway. Swiss Honorary Consulate of Salt Lake City. Religious groups =Jewish community= The Jews who first settled in Salt Lake City in the 1850s were merchants and businessmen of German and Hungarian origin coming from the Eastern United States. They started successful stores and enterprises. Their number increased with the opening of the railroad. In 1876 there were some forty families, and by 1891 that number was already doubled. Several of them became prominent businessmen and citizens, occupying top positions in the city council, in the legislature, and in the chamber of commerce. Simon Bamberger became the first non-Mormon Governor in 1916, and Louis Marcus became mayor of Salt Lake in 1932. On the religious side, the Jewish community built their first synagogue in 1883, in the downtown area. They had problems because of the antagonism between the orthodox minded East Europeans and the liberal Germans. At the end they decided for separation and the building was sold. Another beautiful synagogue was built by the liberal group in 1891. For their social events the Jewish community purchased a large and elegant building near downtown, that remained active for many years. In 2003 a new Jewish Community Center was purchased near the campus of the University of Utah. Also the synagogue has been moved from downtown, closer to a residential area. In 2005 the Jewish community counted about 5,000 members.Juanita Brooks, The History of the Jews in Utah and Idaho (1973); Louis C. Zucker, Jews of Salt Lake City (1975) * Organizations.

Elizabeth was born at Rivi√®re House, in the parish of Phillack, near Hayle, Cornwall, and baptised in Phillack church on 15 May 1820. At Rivi√®re House, owned by the Cornish Copper Company of which her father was the Company Director, the cellars were fitted out as laboratories where smelting processes of copper and tin were tested, and minerals and rocks studied for their constituents. To that laboratory had come, before she was born, Davies Gilbert, PFRS, bringing with him the young Humphry Davy to view the workings of a scientific environment.History of the Cornish Copper Company, W. H. Pascoe Born into an influential and wealthy Methodist family of mining agents and merchants, Elizabeth was acutely aware throughout her life of poverty and deprivation in surrounding mining areas, and the dire need for education and social support for those less fortunate. She read widely, studied mathematics, the classics, and learned several languages.

Educated at home in Chapel Street, Penzance, with her sisters, she assisted her father with his extensive mineral collections and shared his keen interest in geological formations, age and density. A close and devoted friend, with whom she regularly corresponded, was the notable Quaker diarist, Caroline Fox of Falmouth's distinguished shipping and mining family. Charitable works On her father's death in 1858, she came into a large fortune, and used this legacy, following the charitable habits of her parents and family, to share considerable sums for educational and other philanthropic purposes. She gave the site for St Paul's school which opened, after her death, at Penzance on 2 February 1876, and founded schools at Wesley Rock (Heamoor), Carfury, and Bosullow, three thinly populated districts in the neighbourhood of Penzance. She made possible by donating the purchase price for the land upon which St John's Hall (the town hall) was constructed and separately built a museum on Lower Queen's Street near her home, in which to exhibit the fine collection of minerals which she had assisted her father in amassing. Geologist and author She took up her father's partnership from 1858 until her death, as head of the Penzance Bank founded by her grandfather, William Carne, in 1795 (Batten, Carne and Oxnam).

Furthermore, the Romanian Ministry of Environment and Water Management is making efforts to align the Romanian environment standards with the European standards. One of the ongoing projects in the country is the construction work on the various sections of the Bucharest-Brasov motorway. An increasing number of foreign companies are showing interest in electrical production capacities in the country. Companies include Germany's Siemens, U.S-based AES Corporation and Geneva-based Societe Bancaire Private. However, the construction industry is subject to a number of risks, which can affect its growth. The rising budgetary deficit, for example, has had an increasingly adverse impact on the availability of funds for the infrastructure sector.

The M√°nes Association of Fine Artists ( or S.V.U.; commonly abbreviated as Manes) was an artists' association and exhibition society founded in 1887 in Prague and named after painter Josef M√°nes. The Manes was significant for its international exhibitions before and after World War I that encouraged interaction between Czech artists and the foreign avant- garde. It played an important role in the development of Czech Cubism and Rondocubism. Between 1928 and 1930, Manes built a complex with a restaurant, club, showroom and offices at the site of the ≈†t√≠tkovsk√Ω Mill and water tower on the Vltava. The architect of the 1928 Manes pavilion was member .M√°nes restoration aims to return functionalist gallery‚Äôs former glory by Ian Willoughby, czechposition.com, 12 January 2012. Retrieved 24 May 2013. Archived here. The union was liquidated under the Communists and was revived after the Velvet Revolution in 1990. Its headquarters became the Diamond House in Prague, itself a landmark of cubist architecture.  Formative years (1885‚Äì1899)  Svaz v√Ωtvarn√Ωch umƒõlc≈Ø M√°nes (\\"Association of Fine Artists M√°nes\\") was established in 1887 as a group of Bohemian artists in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. Its forerunner was ≈†kr√©ta, spolek mlad√Ωch ƒçesk√Ωch v√Ωtvarn√≠k≈Ø v Mnichovƒõ (\\"≈†kr√©ta, a Fellowship of Young Czech Artist in Munich\\"), an organization of Czech art students in Munich, an art center largely visited by Central and Eastern European art students. The name of this society came from seventeenth century Bohemian painter Karel ≈†kr√©ta. Formed in 1885 it became one of the largest communities of Czech students abroad. It had its own infrastructure and annual show. It had regular contact with the homeland and published a journal in two parts: Paleta & ≈†pachtle (\\"Palette\\" and \\"Spatula\\"). This journal was circulated within the association only and all members had to contribute to it on weekly bases. Their focus was mainly on the German art scene. The group accepted other Slavic students as members. The ≈†kr√©ta Fellowship renamed itself to Svaz v√Ωtvarn√Ωch umƒõlc≈Ø M√°nes (abb. SVU M√°nes), after painter J. M√°nes, who lived and worked in the first half of the nineteenth century in Czech Lands and Germany, and who attended the Munich Art Academy. Many founding members of the ≈†kr√©ta moved to Prague in 1887 ‚Äì probably due to reforms at the Prague Art Academy ‚Äì and finished their studies there. The ≈†kr√©ta Fellowship continued until its members Alfons Mucha and Ludƒõk Marold left Munich for Paris. Between 1885 and 1899 the focus was mainly on Palette and Spatula. Palette was a journal of art and literature and Spatula was a satirical magazine. These first fourteen years were the most important for the future development of modern Czech art scene. SVU M√°nes took under its wings painting, sculpture and architecture. This notion was reflected in their emblem of three shields representing each the three art forms. The goals of SVU M√°nes were mainly based on an old idea of patriotism with allegorical paintings from the Czech history, but they soon moved to modern art and its influx in Bohemia. One of the main differences from neighboring groups such as Munich and Viennese Secession was in their constant fight against pan-Germanism. One difference from Polish group Sztuka was in SVU M√°nes‚Äô openness to the international art scene.  Infrastructure  SVU M√°nes averaged some 300 members between 1887 and 1899. It was a large organization for the Prague environment and for a secessionist group. Its first elected president was painter and illustrator Mikol√°≈° Ale≈°, a (Ale≈° illustrated Old Czech manuscripts and was proclaimed by the critics as na√Øve, but SVU M√°nes supported him and presented him with a diploma). Ale≈°, twenty years older than the rest of the members, had strong leadership and organization skills. Along with a sculptor, principal patron and chief organizer of SVU M√°nes, Stanislav Sucharda, they formed a strong lead. The editorial board was elected annually. The first most influential editors were painter Karel V√≠tƒõzslav and painter and draughtsman Jan Preisler. Probably the most important role in SVU M√°nes had , a journalist and an art critic.  Notable members  A 2012 exhibition at the Manes.  Evolution of secession in Prague  SVU M√°nes rebelled against the old and rigid system of art exhibitions, art politics and pan-Germanism of art in Czech. Multiple events helped the patriotic SVU M√°nes to achieve its success before their first exhibition in 1898. * Jubilejn√≠ V√Ωstava Jubilee Exposition in Prague in 1891 included an art exhibition. * In 1893 student political party Omladina [The Youth] was established looking for autonomy from the Empire. * In 1893 Czech artists published a petition in general newspapers. They appealed to citizens to support Czech art by commissions and visitations of Czech art exhibitions. * In 1895 the Manifest of Czech Modernism was published, signed mainly by writers and critics (including F. X. ≈†alda). It proclaimed neutrality in politics and humanist ideals. They were interested in Czech history, in feminist issues and individualism even in politics. M√°nes was their great example. * A book by Toma≈° Garigue-Masaryk (future first president of Czechoslovakia) ƒåesk√° ot√°zka (Czech Question) whose focus was the nation‚Äôs evolution based on humanist principles, solution of social problems and anti- Semitism. Masaryk compared Czech history with the world‚Äôs historical evolution. * The first Czech art exhibition in Topiƒç salon produced a promotional poster by Viktor Oliva that was the first Bohemian poster exhibited internationally. * In 1897, Rudolf√≠num (an equivalent to Parisian Salon) exhibited 950 works of art and received mocking reviews of a tasteless and overcrowded installation. * In 1898 Czech language decrees (attempt to promote Czech as an equal language to German) reached their height with victory for Czechs. The Austrian government in Prague fell. The national celebration was visible in an annual exhibition of the German Art Union trying to exhibit a painting by Franz von Lenbach Theodor Mommsen. Mommsen was a German historian who the Czech public viewed as a great chauvinist. The reaction against this painting by the Czech audience caused the painting‚Äôs removal to protect it. This was followed by an appeal in newspapers for artists to leave the German Art Union and to boycott this show. * In 1898, SVU M√°nes exhibited its first group show.  Important Exhibitions  = 1897-98 = In 1897, SVU M√°nes opened its first preliminary exhibition of competing posters. These were designed for its first exhibition the following year. SVU M√°nes' first exhibition was 5 February to 5 March in 1898 in Topiƒç salon (a commercial gallery in the center) in Prague. With this exhibition, SVU M√°nes proclaimed its secession. Thirty participants among the eighty members with landscapes dominating the show. The installation was similar to that in Rudolf√≠num, but many fewer works were selected. On 3 November another exhibition was held in the same location, exhibiting fifty works from artists Jo≈æa Uprka, Franti≈°ek B√≠lek, Zdenka Braunerov√°, Anton√≠n Hudeƒçek and Anton√≠n Slav√≠ƒçek. With this exhibition, the members refused Rudolf√≠num as an exhibiting society, and stepped toward their own exhibiting building. This exhibition went up during the same time of preparation of the first exhibition of the Viennese Secession with which they had a competitive relationship. SVU M√°nes show attracted members of Viennese society, who offered participation to Czech painters to exhibit in Vienna. Franti≈°ek B√≠lek agreed, while Stanislav Sucharda refused absent an autonomous Czech show in Vienna. = 1899-1900 = In 1899, SVU M√°nes began organizing traveling exhibitions in other towns of Bohemia and Moravia to increase public awareness. In 1900 SVU M√°nes exhibited in Viennese K√ºnstlerhaus. Also in 1900, SVU M√°nes opened its third exhibition, showing sixty works in the Topiƒç salon. KU Ministerium supported this show. It toured Brno and Vienna, getting more credit on its home soil as a competitor to Rudolf√≠num, but it brought new audiences and recognition in the international press. Among the exhibiting artists was Jan Preisler with his The Wind and Breeze, Franti≈°ek B√≠lek, who caused surprise and Franti≈°ek Kupka. After this exhibition, Anton√≠n Slav√≠ƒçek and Maxmili√°n ≈†vabinsk√Ω (The Poor Country) were invited to Miethke gallery in Vienna and ≈†vabinsk√Ω became the most exportable Bohemian artist. For the first time, SVU M√°nes‚Äô exhibition had a designer in architect Jan Kotƒõra who focused on simplicity and purity with respect to painting, sculpture and prints. This differed from the over- crowdedness of Rudolf√≠num and the over-ornamentation of the Viennese Secession. Sculptures were not for decoration but they were installed as autonomous art works. = 1902 = In 1902, SVU M√°nes exhibited in Hagenbund, which became its frequent host. After a visit to Paris Exposition of 1900, Alfons Mucha and Josef Ma≈ôatka invited sculptor Auguste Rodin to exhibit his works in Prague. This event took place in Manes‚Äô new exhibiting building, the M√°nes Pavilion in 1902, designed by Jan Kotƒõra. Kotƒõra took on an idea of Paradise with each sculpture displayed in its own space, not competing with the others, with floors covered with gravel and shrubs expanding the garden theme. This show utterly overshadowed Rudolf√≠num, making SVU M√°nes the main exhibiting body in Bohemia. The exhibition also increased public interest in foreign art. Rodin influenced artists such as Sucharda, Ladislav ≈†aloun and Bohumil Kafka. This show had a political background of Czech intellectuals looking toward France, appealing to French republican artistic freedom. Rodin showed eighty sculptures and seventy drawings. His sculptures revealing intimate bodily details, sexuality and psychological expression, was new to Prague. He was taken as a genius by artists and critics, who appealed for Czech artists to follow his path by looking to themselves. This exhibition had a further impact on Austria and Germany. After Prague, Rodin took some of his pieces to Vienna. This show made Prague an international exhibiting city. Following Rodin‚Äôs exhibition, SVU M√°nes presented a retrospective of contemporary French painting the Nabis who Czech artists knew since the 1890s from their Parisian visits for their freedom of form and deliberate experiments. Another exhibit presented works of Mikola≈° Ale≈°, Hudeƒçek and French graphic arts. The year's last exhibition was a visiting show in Krak√≥w hosted by Sztuka. Among the 132 Czech artists who exhibited there, belonged Franti≈°ek B√≠lek, Sucharda, Kafka, ≈†aloun, Jo≈æa √öprka, Maxmili√°n ≈†vabinsk√Ω, Alois Kalvoda, Anton√≠n Slav√≠ƒçek, Franti≈°ek Kupka and others. = 1903 = A similar exhibition opened in 1903 in the M√°nes Pavilion, surveying Czech art production, followed by a retrospective of Josef M√°nes. He was the only non- contemporary artist exhibited in SVU M√°nes. An exhibition of Worpswede continued SVU M√°nes‚Äô interest in international art scene along with another show of Croatian contemporary art of Dru≈æstvo umjetnosti [Association of Art]. = 1904 = Returning to the domestic art scene, SVU M√°nes hosted a retrospective of Jo≈æa √öprka. SVU M√°nes members had their first group show in their new building, followed by a group show of Anton√≠n Slav√≠ƒçek, Bohumil Kafka, Josef Ma≈ôatka, Stanislav Sucharda and Ladislav ≈†aloun. = 1905 = SVU M√°nes presented an exhibition of Edvard Munch. Following Munch show was another group exhibition and after that an exhibition of T. F. Simon. In the winter of 1905-06, SVU M√°nes hosted Danish artists. = 1906-07 = 1906 brought an exhibition of N. K. Roerich along with Francisco Goya and another member show. The following year Henri le Sidaner together with Louis Dejean exhibited. After that, French Impressionism occupied the M√°nes Pavilion. Members and architects established Sdru≈æen√≠ architekt≈Ø M√°nese [Association of M√°nes‚Äô Architects] that, a year later, began publishing its journal Styl [Style] concentrating on contemporary art and design. At the turn of 1907 and 1908, English etchings arrived to Prague under the SVU M√°nes‚Äô umbrella. = 1908-10 = Auguste Rodin together with Ludwig v. Hofmann exhibited in 1908, followed by SVU M√°nes‚Äô group show. √âmile Bernard; E. A. Bourdelle; SVU M√°nes‚Äô group show came in 1909. In 1910 SVU M√°nes‚Äô presented a group show of sketches: Les Independents; Slav√≠ƒçek; Axel Gellen-Kellela; Munch; and Swedish Art.  Impact of Munch Show  When SVU M√°nes presented Edvard Munch, the audience was shocked. This artist had an immense impact on the future development of modern art in Bohemia. No other show divided Czech artists as much. The artist community fell into two hostile camps. In 1907, eight art students formed \\"Osma\\" [The Eight], finding SVU M√°nes too provincial. F. X. ≈†alda was the only critic who agreed with the new group. The main two members of Osma were Bohumil Kubi≈°ta and Emil Filla. Kubi≈°ta responded with Night of Love in 1908 and Filla with Reader of Dostoevsky in 1907. Jan Preisler was the only SVU M√°nes member who responded to Munch with his painting Woman by a Lake, however after harsh criticism he abandoned this style. Criticism of Preisler‚Äôs work angered Osma even more.  1912‚Äì1914: Cubist schism  In 1912, SVU M√°nes split, following the Cubist art scene in Paris: the Montmartre Cubism of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, and Section d'Or Cubism led by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger. Prague's key followers of Montmartre Cubism in Prague were artists Emil Filla and Otto Gutfreund, while the nucleus of the opposing camp was created around the ƒåapek brothers. Bohemian Cubists combined Cubism with Expressionism, some with Futurism, Orphism and Rayonism, while others concentrated on national or existential subject matters. The artists influenced by Montmartre Cubism established Skupina v√Ωtvarn√Ωch umelc≈Ø [Group of Artists].  Voln√© Smƒõry journal  Voln√© Smƒõry (Free Currents)Voln√© Smƒõry, available online: November 1896 - 1902 (61 issues), Blue Mountain Project was a journal of SVU M√°nes first published in 1896. At first the association oriented its journal mainly toward literature, another driving force behind the Czech secessionist movement. Association members competed in its pages. The journal worked as a Gesamtkunstwerk [total work of art]. The editors also included information about international and domestic art scene and art criticism. In 1902, installation designs began to appear. The journal competed mainly with Ver Sacrum of the Viennese Secession in content and form. At this point, its primary goal was promotion of Czech art along with introduction and commentary on the international art scene. Its funding came at first from members. The main editors were Vojtƒõch Preisler and Arno≈°t Hofbauer. Voln√© smƒõry reached a wide public, with coverage better than its main competitor journal Modern√≠ revue [Modern Review]. Other competing journals in Czech at the time were: L‚ÄôArt, L'Art et industrie, Gazette des Beaux-Arts, Revue des Arts Decoratifs, La Plume, L‚Äô Art et les artistes, The Art Amateur, Art Journal, Art Pictorial & Industrial, The Studio, Formenschatz, Dekorative Kunst, Die Kunst, Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration, Kunst und Handwerk, Skulpturenschatz, Zeitschrift f√ºr Bildende Kunst and Die Graphischen Kunste. In 1897, in its second volume, a special issue was dedicated to regionalist painter √öprka. A year later, Kotƒõra published an essay to appeal to Czech citizens to think for themselves when looking at art and architecture. He stated that Czech art and architecture should be Czech, with Czech form, using local materials and technologies. Form should reflect modern times and should not mimic foreign art and architecture. Kotƒõra used a universal and pragmatic tone in his essay, without providing a definition of the Czech form. Open debates in Voln√© smƒõry and other journals considered the planned destruction of Prague‚Äôs historical center. In 1899, a special issue was dedicated to symbolist sculptor Franti≈°ek B√≠lek. In the same year, Kotƒõra became one of the main editors and a professor of University of Architecture and Applied Arts in Prague. He studied directly under Otto Wagner in Vienna. At the turn of the century, a special issue devoted to the Third SVU M√°nes exhibition was produced for the first time for Viennese audiences. The Rodin show was accompanied by a special double-issue dedicated to the sculptor in 1901, a year before its opening. By 1903, the journal established a comfortable position financially with approximately 1800 subscribing readers.  M√°nes Pavilion  In 1902 Kotƒõra designed the M√°nes Pavilion for the Rodin exhibition. It was supposed to be only a temporary building, erected in four weeks. The pavilion was functional and flexible. Lit from the top, it had movable walls and Karel ≈†pillar adorned it with a patriotic Slavic wooden lintel and allegorical mosaic. Manes used it until 1914. Its location was near the city center, close to a space where Prague officials wanted to build a modern gallery.

It was completed by the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD) in 1998 to improve the quality of drinking water for its 550,000 customers in Central and Eastern Contra Costa County, and the reservoir is accessible via Vasco Road, a road which connects Brentwood and Livermore. History Los Vaqueros Reservoir is named for the 19th century Mexican Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros land grant that included its site. The Spanish word vaquero means \\"cowboy\\" in English. Incursions of saline water into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta from the San Francisco Bay has been a concern since the 1870s. This concern was one of the reasons CCWD was formed in 1936. A drought in 1977, caused salinity levels to exceed public health standards. It forced CCWD to ration deliveries of fresh water to its customers.Los Vaqueros Project History . An expansion project begun in 2010 raised the height of the dam to increase storage capacity from 100,000 acre-ft to 160,000 acre-ft of water.

Watershed Description The Los Vaqueros watershed comprises of open space surrounding the reservoir. Water is pumped into the reservoir from a Delta intake on Old River in the Sacramento- San Joaquin Delta. The intake is located just east of Discovery Bay. Water is pumped into the reservoir when salinity is low, and used for drinking water when salinity in the Delta is too high. Water from the reservoir is released via a pipeline to the Contra Costa Canal, which conveys water to six water treatment plants throughout the Water District's service area. The reservoir can store up to of water. The earthen dam is high with a crest length. It is made of 2.7 million cubic yards of fill material. The Watershed hosts the Mallory Ridge RAWS weather data collection site on the ridge above the Marina. It is maintained by the Los Vaqueros Watershed staff and linked to the National Fire Weather System.Contra Costa Water District - Los Vaqueros Reservoir and Watershed weather Other benefits of the reservoir include water storage for drought or emergencies, a protected open space, and recreation. There are of hiking trails in the watershed. The watershed is open for fishing, hiking and other activities year-round.

The watershed is currently home for many rare, threatened and endangered species including fairy shrimp, bald and golden eagles, Alameda whipsnake, western pond turtle, California tiger salamander, California red-legged frog, San Joaquin kit fox, and the San Francisco dusky-footed wood rat. It also provides habitat for hundreds of common plant and animal species in the area. Strict environmental commitments with State and federal agencies, and a commitment to preserving the resource help preserve this site. As of February 17, 2017, seven of the trails on the Los Vaqueros property have been temporarily closed to protect possible golden eagle nests. Four pairs of eagles have exhibited nesting behavior, according to CCWD, and the number may change during the spring. More trails may be closed, or some that have been closed may be reopened, depending on how productive the nests are. The closures typically last until late May or June, when the eaglets are fledged. Visiting Los Vaqueros The north entrance is about south of Brentwood on Walnut Blvd, leading to the main parking area and is near the start of the Interpretive Center and the main hiking trails. The south entrance is off of Vasco Road, north of Livermore and leads to the marina area and four fishing piers. There is no road inside the property that connects the two entrances.

It is expressed in the extracellular matrix of various tissues during development, disease or injury, and in restricted neurogenic areas of the central nervous system. Tenascin-C is the founding member of the tenascin protein family. In the embryo it is made by migrating cells like the neural crest; it is also abundant in developing tendons, bone and cartilage.  Gene and expression  The human tenascin C gene, TN-C, is located on chromosome 9 with location of the cytogenic band at the 9q33. The entire Tenascin family coding region spans approximately 80 kilobases translating into 2203 amino acids. Expression of TN-C changes from development to adulthood. TN-C is highly expressed during embryogenesis and is briefly expressed during organogenesis, while in developed organs, expression is absent or in trace amounts. TN-C has been shown to be upregulated under pathological conditions caused by inflammation, infection, tumorigenesis, and at sites that are subject to unique biomechanics forces. The regulation of TN-C is induced or repressed by a number of different factors that are expressed during embryonic tissue, as well as developed tissues during remodeling, injured, or neoplastic. TGF-Œ≤1, tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, interleukin-1, nerve growth factor, and keratinocyte growth factor are factors that have been shown to regulate TN-C. Other extracellular matrix components such as matrix metalloproteins and integrins are also frequently co-expressed with TN-C. In the developing central nervous system, TN-C is involved in regulating the proliferation of both oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes. Expression of TN-C by radial glia precedes the onset of gliogenesis, during which time it is thought to drive the differentiation of astrocytes. In the adult brain, TN-C expression is downregulated except for the areas that maintain neurogenesis into adulthood and the hypothalamus. TN-C is also present in central nervous system injuries and gliomas.  Structure  Tenascin C is an oligomeric glycoprotein composed of individual polypeptides with molecular weights ranging from 180 to ~300kDa. The Tenascin family of proteins shares a similar structural pattern. These similar modules include heptad repeats, EGF-like repeats, fibronectin type III domains, and a C-terminal globular domain shared with fibrinogens. These protein modules are lined up like beads on a string and give rise to long and extended molecules. At the N-terminus each Tenascin has an oligomerization domain which in the case of TN-C leads to the formation of hexamers. TN-C and -R are known to be subject to alternative splicing. In human TN-C there exists, in addition to the eight constant repeats, nine extra repeats subject to alternative splicing. This results in a multitude of TN-C subunits differing in the number and identity of fibronectin type III domain repeats.  Interactions  Tenascin-C has been shown to interact with fibronectin. This interaction is shown to have the potential to modify cell adhesion. A solid-state interaction between fibronectin and TN-C results in cellular upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase expression. TN-C also interacts with one or more TN-C receptors on cells which activate and repress the same signal transduction pathway. An example of this interaction is the adhesion of SW80 carcinoma cells to the third FN-III repeat of TN-C via the Œ±vŒ≤3 integrin receptor leads to cell spreading, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin and ERK2 MAPK, and proliferation. In contrast, when these same cells use either Œ±9Œ≤1 or Œ±vŒ≤6 integrins to adhere to the same third FN type III repeat, cell spreading is attenuated and activation of these signaling mediators and cell growth is suppressed or fails to occur.  Function  Tenascin C is a very diverse protein that can produce different functions within the same cell type. This myriad of functions is accomplished through alternative splicing of mRNA as well as the temporal activation of signal transduction pathways and/or target genes at different stages of growth or differentiation. TN-C is classified as an adhesion-modulating protein, because it has been found to inhibit cellular adhesion to fibronectin. Much of the functional studies are inferred from various TN-C knockout mice models. TN-C clearly plays a role in cell signaling as evidenced by its ability to be induced during events such as trauma, inflammation, or cancer development. Also, TN-C is important in regulating cell proliferation and migration, especially during developmental differentiation and wound healing.  Clinical significance  Tenascin C continues to be researched as a potential biomarker for a number of diseases such as myocarditis and different forms of cancer. The numerous involvements with cellular functioning and signaling make TN-C a popular protein to study in developing new therapies and detection methods. Recent work has shown that TN-C inhibits HIV infection in immune cells by binding to a chemokine coreceptor site on the HIV-1 envelope protein, blocking the virus' entry into the host cells. =Role in cancer= Tenascin C is implicated in a number of different cancers such as osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, bladder cancer, and glioblastomas. In glioblastoma cells, Tenascin-C expression provides much clinical and functional significance in terms of cancer prognosis and tumor progression. The endogenous pool of tenascin-C isoforms in gliomas supports both tumor cell proliferation and migration. Because tenascin-C is essential to the survival of these various forms of cancers, tenascin-c expression could be a potential biomarker for cancer detection. Also, tenascin-C antibodies have been used to diagnose and create therapies for many different types of cancers.

Symbolic meaning  An un-gy≈ç komainu Meant to ward off evil spirits, modern komainu statues usually are almost identical, but one has the mouth open, the other closed (however, exceptions exist, where both komainu have their mouth either open or closed.Shogakukan Encyclopedia, Komainu). The two forms are called and or referred to collectively as a-un.Iwanami Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version This is a very common characteristic in religious statue pairs at both temples and shrines. The pattern is Buddhist in origin (see the article about the Ni≈ç, human-form guardians of Buddhist temples) and has a symbolic meaning: The open mouth is pronouncing the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, which is pronounced \\"a\\", while the closed one is uttering the last letter, which is pronounced \\"um\\", to represent the beginning and the end of all things.JAANUS, A un, accessed on July 10, 2010 Together they form the sound Aum, a syllable sacred in several religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.  History  A statue of a guardian lion looking over Mount Emei, China Komainu strongly resemble Chinese guardian lions and in fact originate from Tang dynasty China.Encyclopedia of Shinto, Komainu The Chinese guardian lions are believed to have been influenced by lion pelts and lion depictions introduced through trade from either the Middle East or India, countries where the lion existed and was a symbol of strength.Shisa Travelogue, Culture of the lion around the world; roots of the shisa During its transportation along the Silkroad, however, the symbol changed, acquiring a distinctive look. The first lion statue in India appears around the 3rd century BC on top of a column erected by King Ashoka. The tradition later arrived in China where it developed into the guardian lion that was later exported to Korea, Japan, and Okinawa. During the Nara period (710‚Äì794), as in the rest of Asia, the pair always consisted of two lions.Kyoto National Museum Dictionary Used only indoors until the 14th century, they were made mainly of wood. During the Heian period (794‚Äì1185), for example, wooden or metal pairs were employed as weights and door-stops, while at the Imperial Palace they were used to support screens or folding screens. During the early Heian period (ninth century), the tradition changed and the two statues started to be different and be called differently. One had its mouth open and was called because, as before, it resembled that animal. The other had its mouth closed, looked rather like a dog, was called komainu, or \\"Goguryeo dog\\", and sometimes had a single horn on its head.JAANUS, Komainu, accessed on July 16, 2010 Gradually the animals returned to be identical, but for their mouths, and ended up being called both komainu. Ubiquitous as they are now at shrines, Komainu have been used outdoors only since the 14th century. In Asia, the lion was popularly believed to have the power to repel evil, and for this reason it was habitually used to guard gates and doors. In Japan, too it ended up being installed at the entrance of shrines and temples next to the lion- dog.Shogakukan Encyclopedia, Shishi As a protection against exposure to Japan's rainy weather, the komainu started being carved in stone. The , the stone animals that in Okinawa guard the gates or the roofs of houses, are close relatives of the shishi and the komainu, objects whose origin, function and symbolic meaning they share.Shisa Travelogue, The Chinese lion-Guardian dogs Their name itself is centuries old regional variant of . Starting from the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868) other animals have been used instead of lions or dogs, among others wild boars, tigers, dragons and foxes. Foxes at Inari shrines A pair of foxes at an Inari shrineThe most frequent variant of the komainu theme is the fox, guardian of shrines dedicated to kami Inari. There are about 30 thousand Inari shrines in Japan, and the entrance of each is guarded by a pair of fox statues. Often one, and sometimes both, has a s≈´tra roll, a key or a jewel in its mouth (s≈´tras are Buddhist texts, a fact which attests to the Buddhist origins of the Inari cultOn the fusion of Shint≈ç and Buddhism, see the article Shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç). The statues do not symbolize the animals' proverbial malice, but the magic powers they are believed to possess. Sometimes the guardians are painted, and in that case they are always white. White foxes are messengers of the kami, who is sometimes himself believed to be, and portrayed as, a fox.Scheid, Inari Fuchsw√§chter Although visible genitals are rare, the left fox is believed to be male, the right one female.Smyers (1999:229) Often the foxes wear red votive bibs similar to those worn by statues of other figures: for example, the Buddhist bodhisattva figure Jiz≈ç.

The subcomponents of services are financial, renting, and business activities (20.5%); trade, hotels and restaurants, and transport (18%); and other service activities (21.7%). The service sector in Romania is vast and multifaceted, employing some three quarters of Romanians and accounting for two thirds of GDP. The largest employer is the retail sector, employing almost 12% of Romanians. The retail industry is mainly concentrated in a relatively small number of chain stores clustered together in shopping malls. In recent years the rise of big- box stores, such as Cora (hypermarket) (of the France) and Carrefour (a subsidiary of the French), have led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of retail jobs to the suburbs. The second largest portion of the service sector is the business services, employing only a slightly smaller percentage of the population. This includes the financial services, real estate, and communications industries. This portion of the economy has been rapidly growing in recent years. It is largely concentrated in the major urban centres, especially Bucharest (see Banking in Romania). The education and health sectors are two of Romania's largest, but both are largely under the purview of the government. The health care industry has been rapidly growing, and is the third largest in Romania. Its rapid growth has led to problems for governments who must find money to fund it. Romania has an important high tech industry, and also an entertainment industry creating content both for local and international consumption. Tourism is of ever increasing importance, with the vast majority of international visitors coming from the EU, though the recent strength of the Romanian leu has damaged this sector. Tourism Sibiu, the 2007 European Capital of Culture Tourism is a significant contributor to the Romania Economy. In the 1990s the government heavily promoted the development of skiing in the Romanian Carpathians. Domestic and international tourism generates about 6% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 0.8 million jobs. Following commerce, tourism is the second largest component of the services sector. In 2006 Romania registered 20 million overnight stays by international tourists, 4% higher than in the previous year and an all-time record. Two-thirds of all major trade fairs from Central Europe are held in Romania, and each year they attract 2 to 3 million business travelers, about 20% of whom are foreigners. The four most important trade fairs take place in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Ia≈üi, Timi»ôoara. In the year 2007, 7,722,000INSSE Romania official figures Numar de turisti straini in Romania tourists vacationed in Romania. The total revenue was $2.1 billionBulgaria atrage turistii straini, Romania producatorii de filme and with an average expenditure of $300 per tourist. Over the years, Romania has emerged as a popular tourist destination for many Europeans, often competing with Greece, Italy and Spain. Romania destinations such as Constan»õa and Mamaia (sometimes called the Romanian Riviera) have become very popular among European tourists. Romania has a highly developed tourism infrastructure, making it a good market for tourism-related equipment and services. In 2006 it is reported that the hotel and restaurant industry added gross value of $8,074 million to the Romanian economy in 2005. Banking and finance Headquarters of Banca Transilvania in Cluj-Napoca (right). To the left headquarters of the county branch of BCR Romania's capital is Bucharest. The City of Bucharest is Bucharest's major financial district, and one of the regional's leading financial centres. The city is where the Bucharest Stock Exchange, as well as many other exchanges, are based. Service industries, particularly banking, insurance, and business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP and employ around 55% of the working population. Many other international banks are beginning to operate bases in Romania, as the sector expands. In 2007 there were 52 banks. In the first four years of the twenty-first century, Romania's BET Index was the best-performing stock market index in the world as declared by the international magazine Business Week. The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Romania was valued at $56 billion in 2008 by the World Bank. As a result, the corporate sector of Romania has grown dramatically in significance in recent times.

He was also the author of several well known medical books. Although he worked primarily as a lecturer in physiology he spent time in the laboratory of Walther Flemming at Kiel in Germany, where pioneer work in cytological technique was going on, and then at W√ºrzburg where he carried out research under Adolf Eugen Fick and Eduard von Rindfleisch. In Oxford, where he then worked as a demonstrator in physiology, he collaborated with Professor J.S. Haldane in determining the composition of air. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, (FRS) in 1922. Many of his hundreds of old students from Guy's Hospital went on to become eminent physicians, surgeons, clinical chemists, haematologists and gynaecologists of their day. For some 30 years until his retirement in 1933, he was chairman and Treasurer of the Guy's Hospital Physiological Debating Society. Biography Marcus Seymour Pembrey was born in 1868 at 164 Walton Street, Oxford where his father John Cripps Pembrey Jnr, a distinguished Oriental scholar, was reader and textual editor for the Oxford University Press. From Oxford High School, he gained a science scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford at the age of 17, and in 1889 he obtained a 1st Class Honours degree in the newly established School of Physiology. In 1892, he graduated from the University College Hospital in London with an MB in medicine and gained various university honours, including the Johnson and the Rolleston Memorial Prizes. He was also awarded the Radcliffe Travelling Fellowship where he spent some time in Flemming's laboratory at Kiel in Germany, where the pioneer work in cytological technique was still going on and at Wurzburg, Germany where he carried out research under Fick and Rindfleisch. He returned to Oxford as Demonstrator of Physiology under Burdon- Sanderson, where he collaborated with Professor J.S. Haldane in determining the composition of the air. In 1895, he took up the Lectureship in Physiology at Charing Cross Hospital in London and gained his MD from Oxford. He married Elizabeth Cicely Crake in 1895 at Jevington Church, near Eastbourne. She was the eldest daughter of the Reverend Edward Ebeneezer Crake and Elizabeth Tanner of the Old Rectory. In 1900, he migrated to Guy's Hospital, London as Lecturer in Physiology, jointly with John W. Washbourn and later with Ernest Starling. He succeeded Professor Starling and became sole Lecturer and in 1920, the post was converted into a London University Professorship. He was the author of a number of papers, published mainly in the Journal of Physiology and the Proceedings of the Royal Society and Guy's Hospital Reports. He was joint author of several well- known medical books. In recognition of his own pioneering experimental work in human physiology, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1922. Marcus Pembrey For many years he was in great demand as a lecturer or as chairman of various debating societies, which had a practical medical interest, such as the Associations of Nurses, Midwives and School Inspectors, Sanitary Institutes and the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). A provocative raciness and a facility with quip and proverb made him the ideal inciter of controversy and the records of these associations are a mine of his sayings, which Old Guy's Men will at once recognise as 'Pembreyisms'. For example; \\" Fasting does not make one more spiritual but compels the victim to live upon his own flesh ‚Äì to become a cannibal\\" ; \\" The petty pilfering of orchards by children should be regarded as a sign, not of original sin but of an imperative demand for vitamins\\" and \\" The toilet of the human breast is to be condemned as a fad ‚Äì the infant desires the taste of its mothers milk and skin, not of scented soap, eau de cologne or tannic acid\\". These 'Pembreyisms' were all quoted from the record of just one meeting! Marcus Seymour served with distinction on the War Office Committee for the Physiological Effects of Food, Training and Clothing on the Soldier and took an active part in experimental marches with the troops.. One of his most famous quotes stated \\"The human or horse works best when well fed, and feeds best when well worked\\". He carried out important work as adviser to the Army Medical Service where he recommended that \\"The short man, in nearly every respect, made a better soldier than his taller comrades\\". He was also an advocate of early marriages and during a speech in Sheffield during 1923 he stated: \\"The greatest service a woman can do is marry early ‚Äì and if I were in America, I should say marry early and often!\\" Many of his hundreds of old students from Guy's Hospital went on to become eminent physicians, surgeons, clinical chemists, haematologists and gynaecologists of their day. For some 30 years until his retirement in 1933, he was chairman and Treasurer of the Guy's Hospital Physiological Debating Society. Apparently, in recognition for his superb influence and brilliant Physiological lecturing skills, he was offered the 'Freedom of the City of London' but modestly declined to accept the great honour due to his dislike of accolades. Marcus and his artistic wife Cicely brought up ten children, most of whom went on to become either doctors, vets or nurses, as did a number of his grandchildren. He died of a pulmonary embolism aged 66 years.

He was one of the founders of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a non-partisan research institute which offers comment on the economic impact of political proposals. Hopper enjoyed a brief political career as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Conservative Party. Education Hopper was brought up in Glasgow where he attended Langside Elementary School followed by Queen's Park Secondary School. He went to the University of Glasgow to read modern languages, and graduated with a 1st Class Master of Arts degree in 1953.\\"Who's Who\\", A & C Black. He served in the Royal Air Force with the rank of Pilot Officer\\"Debrett's People of Today\\". in the education branch from 1953 to 1955. Business career In 1956 Hopper joined W. R. Grace and Company in New York City to work as a financial analyst. After three years, he returned to Britain to be London office manager of H Hentz & Co, who were members of the New York Stock Exchange. After six years he became general manager of S. G. Warburg & Co Ltd, and three years after that he was made a Director of Hill Samuel. Institute for Fiscal Studies Hopper had discussed with three friends, all of whom were professional finance employees, the way in which Capital Gains Tax had been introduced in 1965, which all concerned thought had been disastrous. Over dinner in July 1968 the friends decided that what was needed was a non-partisan Institute which would research such proposals and report on them to the political world and the wider public; the Institute for Fiscal Studies was formally launched on 21 May 1969 with Hopper as founder chairman. The Institute also had undeclared objectives of improving procedures for changing taxation, and making taxation more rational.Bill Robinson, \\"The early days of IFS\\" in Fiscal Studies, Vol. 11, No. 3, August 1990. While at Hill Samuel, he became involved in examining the possibility of the Common Market developing a Common Capital Market which might include the United Kingdom; he knew this would transform the operation of the London capital markets.Peter Hill, \\"Common Market fishing policy is 'badly designed for Britain'\\", The Times, 30 June 1971, p. 19. In 1975, Hopper left Hill Samuel to become a director of Morgan Grenfell. He was awarded the 'Deal of the Year' by Institutional Investor magazine in 1976 for his handling of a bond issue for the European Investment Bank. European Parliament Hopper became increasingly involved in politics in the late 1970s. In August 1977 he wrote to The Times to criticise Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey for threatening retaliation against companies who broke Government incomes policy; Hopper considered that doing so was arbitrary and amounted to an abandonment of the rule of law. He asked rhetorically whether \\"liberal democracy [is] dead in the land of its birth?\\"\\"Pay policy and rule of law\\" (letter), The Times, 16 August 1977, p. 11. For the 1979 European Parliament election, Hopper was chosen as the Conservative Party candidate for Greater Manchester West, a constituency which included Bolton, Salford and Altrincham. The constituency had had a Labour majority at the 1979 general election but Hopper succeeded in scoring a surprise victory by 302 votes, which made it the narrowest win in the country.F.W.S. Craig and T.T. Mackie, \\"Europe Votes 1\\", Parliamentary Research Services, 1979. Monetary union Hopper specialised in economic policy at the European Parliament. In November 1980 he made a speech on behalf of the European Democratic Group in which he urged that member states not adopt economic policies which were in competition with each other. He said that the European Monetary System needed central supervision but should not concentrate on keeping currency exchange rates within narrow bands and instead make it difficult for member states to export unemployment to each other.\\"Closer economic links in Europe urged\\", The Times, 20 November 1980, p. 5. The next month he criticised the government of Japan for managing its exchange rates to promote exports, particularly of cars, which meant that there had never been fair competition.\\"Crisis facing Europe's car industry: attack on Japanese exchange policy\\", The Times, 18 December 1980, p. 8. 1981 budget When 364 economists wrote to denounce the Conservative government's 1981 budget, Hopper defended the government by arguing that the group \\"had 364 different opinions\\" on an alternative policy, and that their call would lead to \\"fiscal stimulation which will end in renewed inflation and yet higher unemployment\\".\\"Monetarism: the blame and the sequel\\" (letter), The Times, 1 April 1981, p. 15. Later that year he criticised Edward Heath for advocating a \\"ringfence\\" of exchange controls across the European Community, which Hopper described as \\"beguiling nonsense\\".\\"Exchange controls in practice\\" (letter), The Times, 16 October 1981, p. 15. At the 1984 European Parliament election, Hopper's constituency underwent unwelcome boundary changes which removed Altrincham and added Bury. In addition, he was opposed by Barbara Castle, the sitting Labour member for Greater Manchester North who was a very well known figure. Hopper was defeated for re-election by 37,698 votes.F.W.S. Craig and T.T. Mackie, \\"Europe Votes 2\\", Parliamentary Research Services, 1984. Later career Hopper had remained at Morgan Grenfell as an adviser while serving in the European Parliament, and he swiftly became a Director of Wharf Resources Ltd., a firm based in Calgary in Canada. His constituency connections in Manchester paid off when he was made a Director of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from 1985 to 1987. He was executive chairman of Shire Trust Ltd from 1986 to 1991 and chairman of Robust Mouldings Ltd from 1986 to 1990; Hopper also served as an adviser to Yamaichi International (Europe) from 1986 to 1988. In 1996 he set up W J Hopper & Co Ltd, an investment banking company, of which he remains executive chairman. Outside of business Hopper has been involved in voluntary sector activities. He was a trustee of the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases Development Trust from 1986 to 1990. He is a Unitarian and was a member of the Committee of Management of Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel from 1995 to 2000, returning in 2004 (he served as chairman in 1995 to 1998). He was also a member of the London District and South Eastern Provincial Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches from 2000 to 2004. Personal Awards 'Deal of the Year' by Institutional Investor magazine in 1976 for his handling of a bond issue for the European Investment Bank.

Early life and family Born to Dan Paull and Theresa Paull (n√©e Lacket-Joe) of a prominent family, and was known to have a particularly close relationship with his maternal grandmother. It was his grandmother that gave him the name Xwecht√°al (\\"the Serpent Slayer\\"), passed down from a legendary ancestor.Patterson, E. Palmer. \\"Andrew Paull and Canadian Indian Resurgence\\" (University of Washington Ph.D. thesis), 1962. His maternal grandfather was known as \\"Hundred Dollar Charlie,\\" who reportedly gave the last potlatch on Burrard Inlet before it was banned by the Canadian government in 1885. Paull was raised in the village of Stawamus, near Squamish, British Columbia, but later his family moved to the village of Eslha7an in North Vancouver, British Columbia where he began to attend St. Paul's Indian Residential School when it first opened in 1899. After six years at residential school, Paull spent two years learning from local S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh chiefs. Paull's time at residential school was clearly important to him as he maintained a close relationship with a number of the oblates and nuns for his entire life.Herbert Francis Dunlop, \\"Andy Paull: As I Knew Him and Understood His Times\\" (Vancouver: The Order of the O.M.I. of St. Paul's Province, 1989). Nevertheless, he held his S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh \\"education\\" to be at least equally important: In 1907, he began on-the-job training with the law offices of Hugh St. Quentin Cayley, and spent four years there learning the practice of law. He never became a professional lawyer, as he would have to become \\"enfranchised\\" (and give up his Indian status) to join the bar association. He worked instead as a longshoreman, as secretary to Chief Harry of Eslha7an Activism Paull eventually moved on to organizing in political struggles on behalf of his people, and indigenous peoples across the country. In 1927 he testified before a special joint committee in Ottawa as an executive and secretary of the Allied Tribes of British Columbia. But after the Canadian federal government made it illegal for indigenous peoples in the country to organize funds for land claims issues, the Allied Tribes of BC quickly dissolved. At home he organized bands, orchestras, athletic teams and labor groups. In 1942 he became the business manager for the Native Brotherhood of British Columbia, but in 1942 he split with the organization and formed the North American Indian Brotherhood. He spoke against enfranchisement for Aboriginals saying, \\"You would be merely selling your birthright for the doubtful privilege of putting a cross on a ballot every four years.\\" A number of issues he fought for were Aboriginal rights and title, education, potlatching, and political organizing.

Born in Paris, he emigrated to London in 1732, where he quickly became a central figure in the introduction of the Rococo style in British design, which was disseminated from London in this period, through the media of book illustrations and engraved designs as well as by the examples of luxury goods in the \\"French taste\\" brought down from London to provincial towns and country houses.  Education  Gravelot was a mediocre student, who did not profit from a premature stay in Rome, financed by his father,He was not a winner of the Prix de Rome nor a pensioner of the French Academy in Rome. from which he returned, his funds depleted, without a stay in Lyon, an artistic center that often provided a stop-over for art students between Paris and Rome. Unsuccessful in a commercial venture at Saint Domingue on his father's account, he returned to Paris and became the pupil first of Jean II Restout, and then of Fran√ßois Boucher. Etching, 1733-1744, Hubert Gravelot (Victoria and Albert MuseumMuseum no. E.2456-1932.)  Early career  His years in London, 1732‚Äì45 were fruitful ones. They coincided with a period when Britain and France were not at war.The period of peace lasted from 1713 to 1744. Though French-trained craftsmen, engravers and even some painters,Antoine Watteau's visit to London was a personal one, to consult Dr. Mead, but several lesser painters were already making careers in Britain, notably Philip Mercier, an early practitioner of the \\"conversation piece\\", and Andien de Clermont. were already working in London, but the Rococo style in luxury works of art was relatively new: the Spitalfields silk industry, always dominated by Parisian innovations rendered by Huguenot designers and weavers, produced its earliest asymmetrical and naturalistic floral designs in the early 1730s,Peter K. Thornton, Baroque and Rococo Silks (London: Faber and Faber) 1965. and the earliest identified full-blown Rococo piece of London silver, by the second-generation Huguenot Paul de Lamerie, can be dated about 1731.Philip A.S. Phillips, Paul de Lamerie: A study of His Life and Works (London) 1935: pls. lxx, lxxiii and lxxix; noted by Michael Snodin, \\"English Rococo and its Continental origins\\", in Rococo: Art and design in Hogarth's England (Victoria and Albert Museum, 1984:27-33) p. 29. Gravelot's trip was not a speculation; he had been invited by Claude du Bosc to engrave designs for an English translation of Bernard Picart's Ceremonies and Religious Customs of... the Known World.Snodin 1984:29. The chronicler of English art and artists George Vertue, an engraver himself, soon took note of Gravelot: \\"His Manner of designing neat and correct much like Picart\\" he noted in 1733. \\"A very curious pen & writes neatly. He has been lately in Glocestershire where he was imployed to drawn Antient Monuments in Churches & other Antiquities... He has tryd at painting a small piece or two.\\"The Note- Books of George Vertue vol. III, Walpole Society,22 (1934). George Vertue noted in 1741 that Gravelot's \\"drawings for Engraving and all other kinds of Gold & Silver worksThere are drawings for snuff-box lids at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at the Morgan Library; an engraving that includes a design for an etui was included in the 1984 Victoria and Albert Museum exhibition Rococo: Art and Design in Hogarth's England shews he is endowed with a great fruitfull genius for desseins inventions of history and ornaments\\"Vertue, vol. III:105 By that time Gravelot had become a central figure in the artistic set that gathered at Slaughter's Coffee House in St Martin's Lane and formed the St. Martin's Lane Academy organised by William Hogarth in the premises of his father-in-law Sir James Thornhill. The St. Martin's Lane Academy was an unofficial precursor of the Royal Academy at a time when there were no public exhibitions of art in London, no annual salons as in Paris, no public museums and no places to see or copy from good examples of paintings save in the houses of the rich or noble.A point made by Alice Newlin, \\"The Celebrated Mr. Gravelot\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, 5.2 (October 1946:61-66) p 61. As a drawing-master Gravelot had Thomas Gainsborough for a pupil.  Personal adult life  Gravelot himself was an inveterate, even obsessive reader; his brother's √âloge reports that he would take a small volume to bed with him, in case of insomnia. His easy and elegant book illustrations\\"Gravelot's easy and elegant handling and composition, both of which can be described as rococo in character, were probably his chief contributions to English art.\\" (Snodin 1984:30); a full section of the 1984 exhibition and its catalogue (D1-28) was devoted to \\"Gravelot and printmaking\\". were worked up from dressed mannikins, fully jointed down to their fingers, which he had made expressly in London.√âloge 1774.  Late career  Gravelot's rococo book illustrations in London reached a peak in the designs he contributed to Theobald's 1740 edition of the complete works of William Shakespeare, for which Gravelot provided 35 frontispieces.  Escape back to France  Anti-French sentiments in London after the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 forced Gravelot's return to Paris that October, accompanied by his student Thomas Major, later the first engraver voted an Associate of the Royal Academy, and with a fortune of 10,000 pounds sterling;The figure reported by Whitley (Artist and Their Friends in England, 1700-1799 [1928] I:94I) is ¬£10,000. Whitley also describes how Gravelot was later able to arrange for Major's release from the Bastille, after the English had been rounded up in Paris and incarcerated. there he soon settled down as a book illustrator: among his book illustrations, projects were Tom Jones (Paris and London, 1750), Manon Lescaut (1753, illustration, left) a D√©cam√©ron (1757), La Nouvelle H√©lo√Øse (1761), the Contes moraux of Marmontel (1765), a French translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses (1767‚Äì71), and of Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata (1771). He died in Paris. His work  His illustrations of contemporary manners and costumes are known to have influenced English artists. Gravelot revitalized illustrative engraving in England, and after his return to Paris, a group of accomplished engravers continued to work in his manner. The descriptive precision and elegance of his line and the variety of his inventions can be seen in the drawings for two of his more important commissions, the second volume of Gay‚Äôs Fables and the second edition of L. Theobald's The Works of Shakespeare in Eight Volumes, and in his illustrations for the first French translation of Boccaccio Le Decameron, 1757.The 5 volumes contain 89 plates, 97 tailpieces and 111 headpieces designed by Gravelot, Fran√ßois Boucher, Eisen and Charles-Nicolas Cochin. The books are listed by Gordon Ray as one of the most outstanding illustrated books of all time. Gravelot's designs for the decorative arts were limited to a suite of engravings for wrought iron work, but his rocailles, his cartouches for maps, his rococo borders provided inspiration for goldsmiths and silversmiths, cabinet-makers like Thomas Chippendale, tapestry cartoons made at the Soho works, and china painters at the Chelsea porcelain manufactory. Gravelot's older brother was the geographer Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville, whose \\"√âloge de M.

There are units (Divisions) in Arbroath, Gosport, Lympstone, Portsmouth, and Plymouth. The RMVCC is exists alongside other Sea Cadets and Royal Marines Cadets as part of the Royal Navy's sponsored cadet organisations. History The RMVCC traces its history back to the formation of the Royal Marines Artillery Cadet Corps in the Mission Hall, Prince Albert Street, Eastney on 14 February 1901. The new Cadet Corps was then based at the now closed Royal Marines Eastney Barracks in Portsmouth. It was formed, so the story goes, to \\"gainfully occupy the spare time of sons of senior Non- Commissioned Officers (SNCOs)\\" after an occasion when the colonel's office window was broken by a ball kicked by an SNCO's son playing outside. The RMACC was initially formed with the motto 'Manners Maketh Man', and re-titled as the Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps in the mid-20th century (sometimes also known as the RM Volunteer Boys Corps). Royal Marines Girl Cadet Corps (also known as the Royal Marines Volunteer Girls Corps) and the Girl Ambulance Corps units existed alongside RMVBC units for some time, and these were merged with the RMVBC after the Second World War, with the current title being adopted by all units in the 1970s. However, RMVCC Portsmouth only accepted girls from the mid-1990s. The RMVCC is also the first military cadet organisation to be titled 'Royal'; indeed, its cadets were 'Royal Marines Cadets' from the date of the organisation's formation (the Marine Cadets of the SCC and CCF have only recently been given this distinction). Since 1901, units were also formed at: *Royal Marine Barracks, Chatham. *Royal Marines School of Music in Deal, Kent. *Forton Barracks, Gosport. *RM Stonehouse in Plymouth. *Commando Training Centre Royal Marines, Lympstone in Devon.

She was a member of the Irish Senate. Early life Nora Connolly was the daughter of Irish republican and socialist leader James Connolly and his wife Lillie Connolly. She was born in Edinburgh, one of seven children. She moved with her family to Dublin when she was three years old. Her formal education in Dublin extended to weekly Gaelic League classes to learn the Irish language. Otherwise, her mother, a former nursery maid, taught her how to read by the age of three and how to write, and arithmetic. The family moved to Troy, New York, when she was nine years old for her father to work at an insurance company. That work fell through, at which time he became increasingly political, prompting the family's eventual return to Ireland, this time to Belfast in 1910, with Nora going ahead a year earlier. After her father's execution, the surviving Connollys tried to depart for America but were denied passports by the British government. Undeterred, they travelled to Boston via Edinburgh with Nora using the pseudonym Margaret (her middle name). In Boston, she met Seamus O'Brien, a courier for Michael Collins, whom she later married in 1922. When she wanted to return to Ireland, she was denied entry but stowed away on a boat from Liverpool dressed as a boy. Her marriage to Seamus was happy but produced no children. Political career Connolly O'Brien in her Cumann na mBan uniform = Influence = Connolly O'Brien was heavily influenced in her political beliefs by her father James Connolly, who was a committed Republican and Socialist. From a young age she attended her father's political meetings, accompanying him on a four-month Scottish lecture tour at age 8. After moving to Belfast in 1911, she began to get more involved in the labour and republican movements while her father James remained in Dublin and became an organizer of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU) in Dublin. She was a founding member of the Young Republican Party, advocating against Partition of Northern Ireland as the Home Rule Crisis increased. She also helped to found the Belfast branch of Cumann na mBan, the women's section of the Irish Volunteers = Prior to the 1916 Rising = At eight years old, she saw her father speak at many socialist clubs in Glasgow, she thereafter became a devotee of socialist politics. She moved to Belfast in 1910 for work, and her family followed soon after. She participated in her first strike whilst working in Belfast over the conditions in which factory workers were being forced to work under. While she was in Belfast she became a founding member of the Young Republican Army and of the girl's branch of the Fianna. She was also a founding member of Cumann na mBan in Belfast. In 1914, plans were being put in place for a rebellion in Ireland. She and her sister helped courier ammunition and arms to hiding places for Erskine Childers and were then rewarded with two rifles. She was then sent to America with a message from her father about the rising planned for 1916. When Connolly O'Brien returned to Dublin she met members of the Military Council who were planning the rising. In the days before the rising, she was sent back to Belfast to try and convince the leading activist there to join the fight. Under the command of a 23-year-old Connolly O'Brien, she and nine other members of Cumann na mBan returned to Dublin to take part in the fight and were the only organised group to leave Ulster to take part in the rising. = 1916 Rising = In her statement to the Bureau of Military History, she described \\"the rare privilege\\" of cooking breakfast for the leaders of the rising at Liberty Hall on the morning of the rising. She was sent back to Co.Tyrone for their safety and to re-muster the Northern Division of the Irish Volunteers, under orders from Patrick Pearse. After the attempt failed, she returned to Dublin with her sister, but due to train disruptions walked from Dundalk, and spending a night in a field near Balbriggan only to arrive hours after the leaders of the Easter Rising surrendered. She vividly remembers visiting her father James Connolly, in Dublin Castle the night before his execution, where she smuggled out statements to the court martial; Before they said goodbye, as he feared for his family, he advised them that there would be resentment against them and advised them to go to the United States = Political career 1916 - 1918 = While in Boston she spoke for hours at Faneuil Hall in order to gain American support and recognition of the Irish Republic. She furthered her efforts by writing a book titled \\"The Unbroken Tradition\\" in which she describes the events of the Easter Rising, which was subsequently banned as President Woodrow Wilson entered the United States in World War One and it was labelled \\"anti-British\\" In 1917 she returned anonymously to Ireland, and remained quiet for some time. She disagreed with the Labour Party's policy on neutrality, and canvassed for Sinn F√©in in the 1918 general election.

Sitting L-R: Thomas Foran, Nora Connolly O'Brien, David O'Leary, Seamus Hughes and Patrick O'Kelly = War of Independence and Civil War 1919‚Äì1923 = Following her return to Ireland in 1917, she remained active in Cumann na mBan and fought during the War of Independence from 1919 to 1921. Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Cumann na mBan had sided on the anti treaty side. Following the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, she supervised an Anti-Treaty first aid post at Tara Hall. Cumann na mBan was outlawed by the Free State government and in November 1922 she was arrested and imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol, with many other members. She was released in 1923 on the writ of Habeas corpus on the grounds her arrest had been unlawful. = Later political career = In 1926 she, along with her brother, founded the short lived Workers Party of Ireland from 1926‚Äì27. Following the meeting of the Republican Congress on 29‚Äì30 September 1934 in Rathmines Town Hall. The Socialist movement in Ireland was divided on whether the Congress should resolve itself into a new revolutionary Socialist Party, or remain as a united front of all progressive forces against Fascism. She supported forming a new political party, but when a resolution was passed to remain as a united front, she and her group withdrew from the congress. She operated the Labour Party's Drimnagh, Dublin Branch, but resigned from the party when the workers- republic cause was deleted from its constitution in 1939. During the 1930s, she was a statistician in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU) and a telegraph agent during the Second World War, until ill-health forced her retirement. She was nominated to the Seanad √âireann in 1957 by nomination of the Taoiseach, √âamon de Valera, and stressed that she would not join his Fianna F√°il Party and remain independent, although she is listed as a Fianna F√°il senator. During her time, she blocked many bills, including the 1959 proposal to abolish Proportional Representation and a church-promoted bill to consign female juvenile offenders to Magdalene Laundries. She was renominated in 1965 by Se√°n Lemass, but his successor Jack Lynch failed to re- nominate her, ending her political career. =Support for Republicans during The Troubles= Connolly O'Brien supported the Provisional IRA during The Troubles. In 1977, she gave the funeral oration of INLA chief of staff Seamus Costello, saying, \\"Of all the politicians and political people with whom I have had conversations, and who called themselves followers of Connolly, he was the only one that truly understood what James Connolly meant when he spoke of his vision of the freedom of the Irish people.\\" Shortly before her death in 1981, she spoke at the 1980 Ardfheis of Sinn F√©in. Death Nora Connolly O'Brien died in Meath Hospital, Dublin, on 17 June 1981, ten days after being admitted due to failing health. She was 88, and was the last of seven children. She had no children of her own. Her husband Seamus had died in 1962. She is buried in Dublin's famous Glasnevin Cemetery. Before she died, she asked to be given a Republican funeral. More than 200 people gathered at her graveside in Glasnevin on that date, and her life was celebrated in the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel, Drimnagh. The Taoiseach at the time, Charles Haughey, did not attend her funeral, even though he had planned to do so; when asked to comment on his absence, he refused, but sources claimed that Haughey decided to avoid the funeral because of its overtly Republican nature.

History Manx Software Systems of Shrewsbury, New Jersey, produced C compilers beginning in the 1980s targeted at professional developers for a variety of platforms up to and including PCs and Macs. Manx Software Systems was started by Harry Suckow, with partners Thomas Fenwick, and James Goodnow II, the two principal developers. They were all working together at another company at the time. Suckow had started several companies of his own anticipating the impending growth of the PC market, with each company specializing in different kinds of software. A demand came for compilers first and he disengaged himself from the other companies to pursue Manx and Aztec C. Suckow took care of the business side, Fenwick specialized in front-end compiler development, and Goodnow specialized in back-end compiler development. Another developer, Chris Macey, worked with them for a while on 80XX development and in other areas. The name \\"Manx\\" was selected from a list of cats for no particular reason except that the name Suckow wanted to use was taken. One of the main reasons for Aztec C's early success was the floating point support for the Z80 compiler which was extended to the Apple II shortly after. Suckow insisted on adding floating point. During the move to ANSI C in 1989, Robert Sherry who was with Manx at the time and interested in the minutiae of standards represented them on the ANSI committee but left shortly after. He also fixed numerous bugs in the Aztec C after Chris Macey and Thomas Fenwick left the company. By this time Microsoft had targeted competitors for their C compiler and Aztec C was being pushed-out of the general IBM-PC compiler market, followed by competition with Apple's MPW C on the Macintosh side and Lattice C on the Amiga after SAS bought them. In 1989 Thomas Fenwick left to work for Microsoft, and James Goodnow worked on Aztec C occasionally but was pursuing other projects outside the company and eventually left the company altogether. Suckow employed about 20 people at that time. Chris Macey returned as a consultant but eventually left to become chief scientist for another company. Mike Spille joined Manx as a developer along with the late Jeff Davis (embedded systems). Throughout the 1990s they continued to make their Aztec C.

Early career Born in Eulogy, Texas, Robinson attended primary school in Walnut Springs, Texas, high school in Dublin, Texas, and college at Fort Worth University before entering the U.S. Naval Academy in 1899. Graduating in 1903, he saw service in the Asiatic Station before making a cruise from Honolulu, Hawaii to Panama aboard the Paul Jones, the first long voyage undertaken by a destroyer. From 1907 to 1909, he circumnavigated the globe with the Great White Fleet aboard the battleship Vermont. During the round-the-world cruise, he met his future wife on a port call in San Francisco, California, and they were married on March 9, 1909, two weeks after Vermont returned with the fleet to Hampton Roads, Virginia. Later that year, the Navy established a formal graduate program at the Academy, and Robinson was one of 10 students selected for the first class of the School of Marine Engineering, alongside future four-star admiral James O. Richardson.Mechanical & Aeronautical Engineering Department - About the Department USS Jupiter (AC-3), on trials near Mare Island Navy Yard, October 16, 1913. Electric drive pioneer Robinson was credited with pioneering electric drive propulsion in the U.S. Navy, beginning with his tour as executive officer and chief engineer of the newly built collier Jupiter. Jupiter was the first major ship equipped with turboelectric drive by the U.S. Navy, as part of a controlled experiment to evaluate the relative merits of competing propulsion mechanisms. Three new colliers of the same class were each equipped with a different propulsion type: Cyclops with reciprocating engines, Neptune with geared turbines, and Jupiter with a turboelectric drive supplied by the General Electric Company. The results of the collier trials would determine which mechanism would be selected to propel future battleships. In August 1913, Jupiter's trials almost ended before they began. While underway off the coaling station in Tiburon, California in preparation for its shakedown cruise, Jupiter took evasive action to avoid an accidental collision with a passing submarine. During the sudden maneuver, a fuse on the main electrical panel blew, shutting down every piece of machinery on the ship, including its steering. With only four minutes before the ship would run aground, Robinson restored power; Jupiter got underway with 30 seconds to spare. Robinson remained with Jupiter for its shakedown cruise, during which the collier traveled from the West Coast to the Atlantic and became the first naval vessel to transit the Panama Canal. At the end of Jupiter 's trials, Robinson reported that turboelectric drive was lighter and more compact than the competing propulsion methods, and moreover was easily operated by relatively unskilled sailors, permitted accurate speed control, and exceeded General Electric's economy estimates by a remarkable 18 percent. Based on his report, turboelectric drive was selected for installation in the new battleship California, and Robinson was assigned to superintend the construction of California's electric equipment at the Mare Island Navy Yard. He was assigned to the Bureau of Engineering from 1914 to 1919, where he helped design five battleships in rapid succession. In spring 1917, he sailed by convoy to Britain to study technical developments of the Royal Navy and spent time as an observer with the British Grand Fleet. From 1919 to 1921 he had sea duty as fleet engineering officer to the commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet. He returned to the Bureau of Engineering in 1921 to begin six years as officer in charge of the Design Division. He became manager of the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Washington in 1927. As chief of Bureau of Engineering (far left), attending Medal of Honor ceremony for Cdr. Claud A. Jones, August 1, 1932. Chief of BuEng In 1931, Robinson was commissioned chief of the Bureau of Engineering (BuEng) with the rank of rear admiral, succeeding Rear Admiral Harry E. Yarnell. During this first of two nonconsecutive terms as the chief Navy engineer, Robinson helped stimulate the development of submarine electric propulsion. At the time, lightweight, high-speed engines were still in the experimental phase and no existing engine was suitable for submarine electric drive. Procuring such an engine was a venture requiring a level of risk and capital investment that was considered prohibitive for a private company. Rather than wait for the private sector to catch up to the Navy's requirements, Robinson launched an innovative bureau-sponsored competition that successfully drew private diesel contractors into the submarine propulsion market. He was relieved as chief of BuEng on May 29, 1935 by Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr. and became inspector of naval materiel at the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York. He was senior member of the Navy Compensation Board in 1938. In September 1939 he was appointed for a second term as chief of BuEng and put in charge of the shipbuilding program as coordinator of shipbuilding. Chief of BuShips In 1940, Robinson became the first chief of the Bureau of Ships (BuShips), a new division formed by consolidating the Bureau of Engineering with the Bureau of Construction and Repair. The merger was the brainchild of Secretary of the Navy Charles Edison, who wanted centralized control of shipbuilding but had failed in a previous effort to create a chief of shore operations, which the sea-going admirals had resisted as placing excessive responsibility and power in the hands of a mere technical officer. In the Bureau of Ships, Robinson generated designs for the ship types ordered by the Chief of Naval Operations. According to Robinson, picking a ship design was like buying a hat: for every new class of ship, the Bureau drafted up to ten different designs, unofficially nicknamed \\"spring styles\\". After six or eight months of drafting work, these tentative blueprints were submitted for consideration by the General Board of the Navy, which then informed the Bureau which choice it preferred. As coordinator of shipbuilding, Robinson laid the groundwork for the dramatic expansion of the fleet under the two-ocean Navy program. Under Robinson, the time between contract plans and working plans was cut from between 15 and 18 months to less than a year, an efficiency achieved in part by Robinson's decision to freeze the designs of combat ships in each category in order to stop the endless engineering delays incurred by frequent design changes. He mustered legislative support by testifying some 50 times before Congressional committees to explain the Navy's materiel requirements, and mobilized industry resources by exhaustively surveying and reserving the nation's shipbuilding facilities. Thanks in large part to Robinson's careful preparation, when Congress appropriated the funds to expand the fleet by 70% in September 1940, the Navy awarded almost every contract within an hour after President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill. By March 1942, the completion date for the two- ocean Navy program, originally projected for 1947, had already been pushed forward to 1945-46. Every major shipyard in the United States was either building or repairing some kind of Navy vessel. Many vessels would be completed more than a year ahead of the schedules specified by their original contracts, including aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and other light warships. By the end of Robinson's tenure, the Bureau of Ships was churning out ships faster than the other bureaus could outfit them with instrumentation and other essentials. World War II Upon America's entry into World War II, Robinson was elevated to production chief for the entire Navy. As director of the newly created Office of Procurement and Material in the Navy Department, Robinson was in charge of all naval material procurement activities, including the construction of ships, aircraft, and shore bases; the manufacture of guns and ordnance; and the purchase of oil, food, clothing, and other supplies. He was promoted to vice admiral on January 31, 1942, the highest rank ever attained by an American staff officer up to that point. In his new role, Robinson exercised unprecedented control over the Navy Department bureau system. For over eighty years, the various bureaus - Ordnance, Supplies and Accounts, Medicine and Surgery, etc. - had functioned more or less autonomously, and the decentralized bureau system had acquired a reputation for parochialism and inefficiency. Bureau chiefs reigned supreme within their own domains, reporting only to the secretary or undersecretary of the Navy, and jealously guarded their statutory prerogatives against repeated attempts to consolidate uniformed authority in the person of the chief of naval operations. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the two-ocean Navy, by now scheduled to arrive in 1944, suddenly was needed immediately. To maximize construction speed, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox created a new Office of Procurement and Material and placed Robinson at its head. The new office worked through the existing bureaus to coordinate all Navy procurement, giving Robinson supervisory authority over all the bureau chiefs, a change in Navy Department governance as sudden and sweeping as the simultaneous consolidation of line authority in the hands of the commander in chief of the United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest J. King. As Navy production chief, Robinson formed one leg of a Navy high command triumvirate whose other members were King, as chief of naval operations and commander in chief of the United States Fleet; and Vice Admiral Frederick J. Horne, as vice chief of naval operations. Robinson delivered naval hardware and supplies to Horne, who combined Robinson's materiel with the manpower trained by the Bureau of Personnel and passed the battle-ready products to King, who deployed them. Robinson and his Army counterpart, Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, reported directly to the chairman of the War Production Board, Donald M. Nelson, who delegated them responsibility for all military procurement in the United States. Robinson was promoted to full admiral on August 27, 1945, twelve days after the victory over Japan, the first staff officer to achieve that rank in the history of the U.S. Navy. He retired from the Navy in 1946 to serve as administrator of the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture in Glen Cove, New York until 1952. Personal life He married the former Emma Mary Burnham on March 2, 1909, and they had two sons: James Burnham Robinson, a naval reservist in the Civil Engineer Corps who was captured at Wake Island in December 1941 and interned as a prisoner of war in Shanghai; and Murray Robinson, a patent attorney in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. He died of pneumonia in Houston, Texas in 1972. His written work includes several technical articles on turboelectric drive; the 1922 textbook Electric Ship Propulsion; and A Brief History of the Texas Navy, an appraisal of the strategic value of the Texas Navy that was published by the Sons of the Republic of Texas in 1961 and mailed to every senior and junior high school in Texas, and to all universities and colleges, as a supplemental chapter in the teaching of Texas history.History of the Sons of the Republic of Texas, Page 4 He recorded an oral history that is archived at the Columbia University Oral History Research Office.Document Details: Reminiscences of Samuel Murray Robinson He was presented the John Scott Award in 1942 for outstanding work in warship design and construction.John Scott Award Recipients 1941-1950 The Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers awarded him the 1942 David W.

During the earliest era of electric power development, coal fired electric stations in urban areas were common prior to the use of Alternating current for lighting as Direct current electricity could only travel short distances.Using English Example industries include: *Iron and steelworks *Automotive industry *Chemical industry *Electric industry Smokestacks are large industrial chimneys used in the process of combusting mostly fossil fuels in furnaces with the goal of producing steam to drive generators for electricity, for the smelting ores, or as a separation or refinery process. The carefully constructed circular stacks were used to both increase the flow of combustible air but also isolate exhaust gases, carbon dioxide and pollutants from ground level releases during ever larger industrial activities. The difference in temperature between the bottom inside and outside of the stack helped to increase the rate air flow through the furnace known as the stack effect. History Smokestacks were first used during industrial revolution between the 17th century and 19th centuries and were known to foul the airs in most larger cities but were most noted in large industrial centers like Manchester England or Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. During the dramatic growth and evolution of systems used to produce electricity coal burning central electric stations that relied on direct current were found throughout cities that released noxious fumes and soot into the city air. Taller smokestacks helped to reduce this environmental issue.

I knew that the sexual, if liberated and ethically expressed, must somehow hold the mystery of return to the much larger-than-sexual Eros.\\" In 2010, Gafni, Mariana Caplan‚Äîthe mother of his son, Sally Kempton, and Lori Galperin, founded the Center for World Spirituality. At the Center, Gafni and Ken Wilber founded a Wisdom Council to envision a spirituality based on Integral Principles. The Wisdom Council includes members such as Gafni, Wilber, Tony Robbins, Warren Farrell, Lori Galperin, Sally Kempton. The co-chair of Center for World Spirituality was Whole Foods CEO John Mackey. Gafni was a Scholar in Residence at the Integral Institute and the Director of the Integral Spiritual Experience but was asked to leave after the 2011 allegations of his sexual misconduct. =Writing= Gafni is the author of eight books on spirituality and religion, including the 2001 Soul Prints. Marc Gafni's second English- language book, The Mystery of Love, was later converted to an audio lecture series called The Erotic and the Holy, published by Sounds True. He also co- authored Who is Afraid of Lilith? Rereading the Kabbalah of the Feminine Shadow with Ohad Ezrachi. He wrote Radical Kabbalah, a two-volume work published by Integral Publishers in 2012. In 2012, he published Your Unique Self: The Radical Path to Personal Enlightenment with a foreword written by Wilber. It won a 2012 USA Best Book Awards in Spirituality: General category. =Television= While in Israel, Gafni hosted (), a television program broadcast on Israel's Channel 2. Gafni also did a series of weekly television spots with Israeli comedian Gil Kopatch on biblical wisdom for every day life. Sexual assault allegations Gafni has been accused of sexual assault multiple times dating back to the 1980s. In early January 2016, Judy Mitzner alleged that she was one of two teenage girls whom Gafni molested in New York City in 1986. She reiterated those claims on an appearance on the Dr. Phil show of January 19, 2018, in which Gafni also appeared. Mitzner was 16 and Gafni was 24 and he was her Jewish Youth Leader at the time. In January 2016, an unnamed woman wrote that she was married to Gafni from 1999 to 2004 in an opinion piece in The Times of Israel. The article was in response to a New York Times article about Gafni the preceding week. She catalogued what she described as her story of abuse and wrote that she had gone public to \\"Protect some girl. Protect some woman. Some student. Some unsuspecting soul.\\" Within two weeks of the publication of the piece in The Times of Israel, Sara Kabakov revealed in The Forward that she was the other formerly unnamed teenage girl who had been abused by Gafni in the early 1980s, beginning when she was thirteen years old. Gafni commented, \\"she was 14 going on 35, and I never forced her.\\" In a subsequent article, The Forward published Gafni's response together with the analysis of sexual abuse experts. Gafni included polygraph results to support his claim that his relationship with Kabakov was consensual. Afterwards, Kabakov responded to Gafni's comments and reiterated her claim that the relationship was not consensual. In February 2017, the National Coalition for Men published an article by Gafni in which he defended himself, calling the allegations \\"a long-standing smear campaign\\". This accusation was also addressed on the Dr. Phil episode of January 19, 2018. In 2006, after he moved to Israel, Gafni was accused by five women who attended the () spiritual center in Jaffa, which Gafni opened in the late 1990s. Gafni acknowledged relationships with some of the women. However, he characterized the relationships as consensual and supported his claim by posting polygraph results on his website. Because of the allegations, and because Gafni fled the country to avoid prosecution, he was dismissed from , which closed within days. Back in the United States, Gafni sent a remorseful letter to his congregation saying he regretted his actions and... \\"Clearly all of this and more indicates that in these regards I am sick. I need to acknowledge that sickness and to get help for it.\\" Gafni later claimed the letter was not an admission of guilt but an attempt to cool the controversy. Gafni was the subject of new allegations of sexual misconduct in 2011. As a result, Integral Life, one of Gafni's promoters, deleted his contributions from its website and announced that it was distancing itself from him. Tami Simon, CEO of Sounds True, canceled her planned publication of Gafni's book, Your Unique Self, and issued a statement denouncing him. The board of directors of the Center for World Spirituality, an organization co-founded by Gafni and of which he is CEO, issued a statement of \\"unequivocal support\\" for Gafni. Wilber first separated from Gafni, but the two eventually reconciled and Wilber rejoined Gafni at the Center for World Spirituality. Your Unique Self was ultimately published by Integral Publishers. As a result of these allegations, a number of new-age spiritual leaders, who had previously worked with and endorsed Gafni, have publicly withdrawn their support and written a public statement disavowing themselves from him, including Deepak Chopra, Joan Borysenko, Andrew Harvey, author Jean Houston, and Stephen Dinan. Additionally, Reb Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, revoked his rabbinical ordination of Gafni, stating, \\"It goes without saying that I withdraw my support of the Smikhah he obtained from me by deceiving me concerning his past unethical behavior. It is null and void.\\" Bibliography *1999 A Certain Spirit {Vadai}: Re-Defining Certainty *1999 Uncertainty {Safek}: Reclaiming the Spirituality of Uncertainty *2002 Soul Prints: Your Path to Fulfillment *2002 Seelenmuster *2003 The Mystery of Love *2005 Who is Afraid of Lilith?

Lateral flow tests,Concurrent Engineering for Lateral-Flow Diagnostics (IVDT archive, Nov 99) also known as lateral flow immunochromatographic assays, are simple devices intended to detect the presence of a target substance in a liquid sample without the need for specialized and costly equipment. These tests are widely used in medical diagnostics for home testing, point of care testing, or laboratory use. For instance, the home pregnancy test is a lateral flow test that detects a certain hormone. These tests are simple, economic and generally show results in around 5-30 minutes. Many lab-based applications increase the sensitivity of simple lateral flow tests by employing additional dedicated equipment. Lateral flow tests operate on the same principles as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In essence, these tests run the liquid sample along the surface of a pad with reactive molecules that show a visual positive or negative result. The pads are based on a series of capillary beds, such as pieces of porous paper, microstructured polymer, or sintered polymer. Each of these pads has the capacity to transport fluid (e.g., urine, blood, saliva) spontaneously. The sample pad acts as a sponge and holds an excess of sample fluid. Once soaked, the fluid flows to the second conjugate pad in which the manufacturer has stored freeze dried bio-active particles called conjugates (see below) in a salt-sugar matrix. The conjugate pad contains all the reagents required for an optimized chemical reaction between the target molecule (e.g., an antigen) and its chemical partner (e.g., antibody) that has been immobilized on the particle's surface. This marks target particles as they pass through the pad and continue across to the test and control lines. The test line shows a signal, often a color as in pregnancy tests. The control line contains affinity ligands which show whether the sample has flowed through and the bio-molecules in the conjugate pad are active. After passing these reaction zones, the fluid enters the final porous material, the wick, that simply acts as a waste container. Lateral flow tests can operate as either competitive or sandwich assays.  Colored particles  In principle, any colored particle can be used, however latex (blue color) or nanometer sized particles of gold (red color) are most commonly used. The gold particles are red in color due to localized surface plasmon resonance. Fluorescent(Point-of-Care Technologies) Developing rapid mobile POC systems - Part 1: Devices and applications for lateral-flow immunodiagnostics (IVDT archive, Jul 07) or magneticParamagnetic-particle detection in lateral-flow assays (IVDT archive, Apr 02) labelled particles can also be used, however these require the use of an electronic reader to assess the test result.  Sandwich assays  Sandwich assays are generally used for larger analytes because they tend to have multiple binding sites. As the sample migrates through the assay it first encounters a conjugate, which is an antibody specific to the target analyte labelled with a visual tag, usually colloidal gold. The antibodies bind to the target analyte within the sample and migrate together until they reach the test line. The test line also contains immobilized antibodies specific to the target analyte, which bind to the migrated analyte bound conjugate molecules. The test line then presents a visual change due to the concentrated visual tag, hence confirming the presence of the target molecules. The majority of sandwich assays also have a control line which will appear whether or not the target analyte is present to ensure proper function of the lateral flow pad. The rapid, low-cost sandwich- based assay is commonly used for home pregnancy tests which detect human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG, in the urine of pregnant women. Illustrating the difference between sandwich assay and competitive assay formats of lateral flow tests  Competitive assays  Competitive assays are generally used for smaller analytes since smaller analytes have fewer binding sites. The sample first encounters antibodies to the target analyte labelled with a visual tag (colored particles). The test line contains the target analyte fixed to the surface. When the target analyte is absent from the sample, unbound antibody will bind to these fixed analyte molecules, meaning that a visual marker will show. Conversely, when the target analyte is present in the sample, it binds to the antibodies to prevent them binding to the fixed analyte in the test line, and thus no visual marker shows. This differs from sandwich assays in that no band means the analyte is present.  Quantitative tests  Most tests are intended to operate on a purely qualitative basis. However it is possible to measure the intensity of the test line to determine the quantity of analyte in the sample. Handheld diagnostic devices known as lateral flow readers are used by several companies to provide a fully quantitative assay result. By utilizing unique wavelengths of light for illumination in conjunction with either CMOS or CCD detection technology, a signal rich image can be produced of the actual test lines. Using image processing algorithms specifically designed for a particular test type and medium, line intensities can then be correlated with analyte concentrations. One such handheld lateral flow device platform is made by Detekt Biomedical L.L.C.. Alternative non-optical techniques are also able to report quantitative assays results. One such example is a magnetic immunoassay (MIA) in the lateral flow test form also allows for getting a quantified result. Reducing variations in the capillary pumping of the sample fluid is another approach to move from qualitative to quantitative results. Recent work has, for example, demonstrated capillary pumping with a constant flow rate independent from the liquid viscosity and surface energy. Mobile phones have demonstrated to have a strong potential for the quantification in lateral flow assays, not only by using the camera of the device, but also the light sensor or the energy supplied by the mobile phone battery.  Control line  While not strictly necessary, most tests will incorporate a second line which contains an antibody that picks up free latex/gold in order to confirm the test has operated correctly.  Blood plasma extraction  Because the intense red color of hemoglobin interferes with the readout of colorimetric or optical detection-based diagnostic tests, blood plasma separation is a common first step to increase diagnostic test accuracy. Plasma can be extracted from whole blood via integrated filters or via agglutination.  Speed and simplicity  Time to obtain the test result is a key driver for these products. Tests can take as little as a few minutes to develop. Generally there is a trade off between time and sensitivity: more sensitive tests may take longer to develop. The other key advantage of this format of test compared to other immunoassays is the simplicity of the test, by typically requiring little or no sample or reagent preparation.  Patents  This is a highly competitive area and a number of people claim patents in the field, most notably Alere (formerly Inverness Medical Innovations, now owned by Abbott) who own patentsU.S. Patent No. 6,485,982 originally filed by Unipath. A group of competitors are challenging the validity of the patents. A number of other companies also hold patents in this arena.  Applications  Lateral flow assays have a wide array of applications and can test a variety of samples like urine, blood, saliva, sweat, serum, and other fluids. They are currently used by clinical laboratories, hospitals, and physicians for quick and accurate tests for specific target molecules and gene expression. Other uses for lateral flow assays are food and environmental safety and veterinary medicine for chemicals such as diseases and toxins. Lateral flow tests are also commonly used for disease identification such as ebola, but the most common lateral flow test is the home pregnancy test.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 11 May. 2017 He was the first painter of the Venetian school who commenced the move away from the Byzantine models preferred by the Venetians towards the Gothic style.Giorgio Tagliaferro, Lorenzo Veneziano at Treccani His work had an important influence on the next generation of Venetian painters. Life The artist's activity is confirmed during the period of 1356 to 1372. Art historians have gradually abandoned the view that the artist should be identified with the painter who signed as 'Lorenzo pentor di S Marina' in 1379. It was formerly believed that the artist trained with Paolo Veneziano but there is no evidence to support this view. (p. 98; plate 42) He appears to have worked extensively outside the Venetian area, possibly because he was not successful in getting commissions from the Venetian Republic. Work Annunciation Polyptych The lack of biographical data on the artist have made it difficult to assess his evolution and influences. His earliest signed work is an altarpiece referred to as the Annunciation Polyptych or the Lion Polyptych painted for the high altar of the church of Sant' Antonio di Castello (now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice). It is dated 1357. An inscription on the polyptych claims it was commissioned by the patrician Domenico Lion. The altarpiece represents the Annunciation with a portrait of the donor Domenico Lion, the Christ in benediction, and figures of various Saints. The scene of the Annunciation on the central table and the Prophets of the upper register manifest an increased modern sensibility as well as a receptiveness to new artistic directions already present in Piedmont. Various features of the Annunciation Polyptych seem to point to Lorenzo's direct knowledge of Venetian and Emilian models. These include the expressive intensity of the faces, the dynamic articulation of the drapes and the abandonment of the Byzantine manner of letting the dark base colors shine through the flesh of persons. Lorenzo favored a chromatic quality with refined timbres and delicate nuances of the local tone. The Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice also possesses an altarpiece by Lorenzo executed in 1371. It originally consisted of five panels, on which an Annunciation and six figures of saints were painted, but it is now broken up into separate works. Also by Lorenzo is Saviour Enthroned with Saints and Angels dated 1369 in the Museo Correr, Venice.Raimond Van Marle, The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting, Volume 4, Springer Science & Business Media, 2012, pp. 51-62 Lorenzo had an important impact on painting in Venice in the last decades of the 14th century. Artists such as Guglielmo Veneziano, Giovanni da Bologna, Catarino Veneziano, Stefano di Sant'Agnese, in particular, and Jacobello di Bonomo, to a more limited extent, were influenced by his style.

Born to a distinguished Swedish family, Lind af Hageby and another Swedish activist enrolled at the London School of Medicine for Women in 1902 to advance their anti-vivisectionist education. The women attended vivisections at University College London, and in 1903 published their diary, The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology, which accused researchers of having vivisected a dog without adequate anaesthesia. The ensuing scandal, known as the Brown Dog affair, included a libel trial, damages for one of the researchers, and rioting in London by medical students.Coral Lansbury, The Old Brown Dog: Women, Workers, and Vivisection in Edwardian England, University of Wisconsin Press, 1985, pp. 9‚Äì11. In 1906 Lind af Hageby co-founded the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society and later ran an animal sanctuary at Ferne House in Dorset with the Duchess of Hamilton. She became a British citizen in 1912, and spent the rest of her life writing and speaking about animal protection and the link between that and feminism.Leah Leneman, \\"The awakened instinct: vegetarianism and the women's suffrage movement in Britain\\", Women's History Review, 6(2), 1997, p. 227.

Early life Born into a wealthy and noble Swedish family, Lind af Hageby was the granddaughter of the chamberlain to the King of Sweden, and the daughter of Emil Lind af Hageby, a prominent lawyer. She was educated at Cheltenham Ladies College in England, which gave her access to the kind of education unavailable to most women at that time. This, combined with a private income from her family, enabled her to pursue her political activism, writing and travelling around the world to deliver lectures, first in opposition to child labour and prostitution, then in support of women's emancipation, and later animal rights.Mike Roscher, \\"Louise Lind-af-Hageby, die kosmopolitische Tierrechtlerin\\", www.tier-im-fokus.ch, 19 December 2010.

Summary: http://lisagalmark.se/sumlindafhageby.htm When Lind af Hageby spoke to the Glasgow Vegetarian Society in 1914, a Daily Mail journalist reported that he had expected to find a \\"square jawed, high browed, slightly angular, and severely and intellectually frugal looking\\" woman, but instead found \\"a pretty, little, plump woman, with kind brown eyes, eyes that twinkle ... She was not even dowdy and undecorative. Her blue dress was ... pretty as anyone could wish.\\" He wrote that he was \\"almost converted to vegetarianism\\" by her \\"straight, hard logic.\\"Leneman 1997, p. 286, n. 49. After college Lind af Hageby spent time in Paris in 1900, where she and a Swedish friend, Leisa Katherine Schartau, visited the Pasteur Institute.Peter Mason, The Brown Dog Affair: The Story of a Monument that Divided a Nation, Two Sevens Publishing, 1997, p. 8. They were distressed by the vivisection they saw there, and when they returned to Sweden joined the Nordiska samfundet till bek√§mpande av det vetenskapliga djurpl√•geriet (the Nordic Anti-Vivisection Society). Lind af Hageby became its honorary chair in 1901. In 1902 the women decided to enrol at the London School of Medicine for Women to gain the medical education they needed to train themselves as anti-vivisection activists. The Shambles of Science Lind af Hageby and Schartau began their studies at the London School of Medicine for Women in late 1902. The women's college did not perform vivisection, but its students had visiting rights at other London colleges, so Lind af Hageby and Schartau attended demonstrations at King's College and University College, the latter a centre of animal experimentation. The women kept a diary and in April 1903 showed it to Stephen Coleridge, secretary of the British National Anti-Vivisection Society. The 200-page manuscript contained one allegation, in a chapter called \\"Fun,\\" that caught his eye, namely that a brown terrier dog had been operated on multiple times over a two-month period by several researchers, then dissected ‚Äì without anaesthesia, according to the diary ‚Äì in front of an audience of laughing medical students: > A large dog, stretched on its back on an operation board, is carried into > the lecture-room by the demonstrator and the laboratory attendant. Its legs > are fixed to the board, its head is firmly held in the usual manner, and it > is tightly muzzled. > > There is a large incision in the side of the neck, exposing the gland. The > animal exhibits all signs of intense suffering; in his struggles, he again > and again lifts his body from the board, and makes powerful attempts to get > free.Lansbury 1985, pp. 126‚Äì127, citing The Shambles of Science, pp. 19‚Äì20, > 29. If true, the allegations meant that the experiment had violated the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, which required for that kind of procedure that the animal be anaesthetized and used once before being euthanized. (Other licences permitted the vivisection of conscious animals.) Coleridge accused Bayliss in public of having broken the law. Bayliss responded with a lawsuit. The trial opened in November 1903, by which time the diary had been published by Ernest Bell of Covent Garden, first as Eye-Witnesses, later as The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology. Lind af Hageby and Schartau testified that they had watched as the dog was brought into the lecture theatre, said they had not smelled or seen any apparatus that would deliver the A.C.E. mixture normally used as an anaesthetic. They testified that the dog had made movements they regarded as \\"violent and purposeful.\\"Mason 1997, p. 15. Bayliss testified that the dog had been anaesthetized and was suffering from chorea, a disease that caused involuntary spasms. The jury accepted Bayliss's account and awarded him ¬£2,000 with ¬£3,000 costs.\\"Vivisectionist exculpated\\", The New York Times, 19 November 1903. The publisher withdrew the diary and handed all remaining copies to Bayliss's lawyer. Lind af Hageby later republished it without the chapter called \\"Fun,\\" and with a new chapter about the trial, printing a fifth edition by 1913. The protracted scandal prompted the government to set up the Second Royal Commission on Vivisection in 1907; it appointed vivisectors to the commission and allowed it to sit in private.Lansbury 1985, pp. 13‚Äì14. Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society Lind af Hageby co-founded the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society (ADAVS) in 1906 with the Duchess of Hamilton, with a shop and office at 170 Piccadilly, London. As part of the society's work, Lind af Hageby drafted a petition in or around 1906, An Anti-Vivisection Declaration, which was distributed around the world, translated into several languages, and signed by prominent anti-vivisectionists.Rod Preece, Awe for the Tiger, Love for the Lamb: A Chronicle of Sensibility to Animals, Routledge, 2002, p. 363. In July 1909 she organized the first international anti-vivisection conference in London; Mary Ann Elston writes that the conference promoted gradualism in the fight to end vivisection.Mary Ann Elston, \\"Lind-af-Hageby, (Emilie Augusta) Louise (1878‚Äì1963),\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004. In 1911 she was living with Margaret Damer Dawson Commandant & founder of the Women Police Service who also helped organise the International Congress of Animal Protection Societies in London in 1906. Lind-af-Hageby v Astor and others Lind af Hageby sued Caleb Saleeby over articles he wrote about her in the Pall Mall Gazette. Lind af Hageby became known as a distinguished orator, particularly after a second libel trial in 1913, when she sued Dr. Caleb Saleeby, a physician, the Pall Mall Gazette, its owner William Waldorf Astor, its editor James Louis Garvin, and its printer D. C. Forrester. The suit was in response to two articles by Saleeby in May 1912, prompted by a graphic vivisection display ADAVS had run in its Piccadilly shop, which Helen Rappaport writes attracted crowds of horrified onlookers. Saleeby accused Lind af Hageby in the Gazette of \\"a systematic campaign of falsehood.\\" Lind Af Hageby represented herself; this was at a time when women could not be admitted as lawyers in the UK, because they were not regarded as \\"persons\\" within the terms of the 1843 Solicitors Act. The trial lasted from 1‚Äì23 April 1913. Lind af Hageby's opening statement lasted nine-and-a-half hours, her evidence nine hours, her cross-examination eight-and-a-half hours, and her closing statement three-and-a-half hours. The New York Times reported that she had uttered 210,000 words and had asked 20,000 questions of 34 witnesses. The case apparently broke records for the number of words. The judge, Mr. Justice Bucknill, said Lind af Hageby had cross-examined as well as any barrister could have done. \\"Her final speech was a very fine one,\\" he said. \\"She is a woman of marvellous power. Day after day she showed no sign of fatigue and did not lose her temper.\\" Lind af Hageby lost the case, but it attracted welcome publicity for her work.\\"1912.-L.-No. 928\\", writ issued 8 May 1912, between Emelie Augusta Louise Lind-Af-Hageby and William Walford Astor, and others; and \\"1912.-L.-No. 1113\\", writ issued 6 June 1912, High Court of Justice, King's Bench Division. \\"Lind-af-Hageby Libel Case\\", Wellcome Collection, accessed 23 April 2012. \\"In the High Court of Justice Kings Bench Division, Before: Mr Justice Bucknill and a Special Jury Lind-af-Hageby v Astor and others, Wellcome Collection, accessed 23 April 2012. > The long trial revealed the most brilliant piece of advocacy that the Bar > has known since the day of Russell, though it was entirely conducted by a > woman.

One after- dinner speaker, Colonel Sir Frederick Cardew, spoke about the importance of women to the anti-vivisectionist cause, wrongly predicting that: \\"The day that women get the vote will be the day on which the death-knell of vivisection will be sounded.\\"Leneman 1997, p. 280. Biography of August Strindberg In 1913, Lizzy Lind af Hageby published a biography of the author and playwright August Strindberg. She praised his work, but did not abstain from criticising his views on women. The book was widely acclaimed.Lisa G√•lmark, The Spirit of Revolt, Lizzy Lind af Hageby, Emma Goldman and August Strindberg, in Strindbergiana, ed. Per Stam, David Gedin, Anna Cavallin, vol. 29, 2014, pp 37-58. First World War, peace movement During World War I Lind af Hageby joined the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace, set up veterinary hospitals for horses hurt on the battlefield, and with the co- operation of the French government created the Purple Cross Service for wounded horses. She also opened a sanatorium in France for soldiers wounded at Carqueiranne, and wrote anti-war pamphlets, including one that appealed to women: \\"Be Peacemakers. An Appeal to Women of the Twentieth Century to Remove the Causes of War\\" (1924). Rappaport writes that she became involved after the war in protesting against cruel sports, including the hunting of pregnant hares, supported the Our Dumb Friends' League, and opposed the sale of old horses to slaughterhouses. Ideas =Anti-vivisection= Horse and cart belonging to Lind Af Hageby's Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society, c. 1910 Lind af Hageby was opposed to vivisection both for the sake of the animals and because she regarded it as bad science, though she told a Royal Commission on Vivisection that she had \\"no objection to vivisection, provided that the vivisectors experiment on themselves.\\"Frederic S. Lee, \\"Miss Lind and her views\\", The New York Times, letter to the editor, 3 February 1909. She argued that it was not enough to vilify vivisection; activists had to educate themselves so that they understood the science well enough to be able to argue their case.Hilda Kean, \\"Aspects of the history of anti-vivisection\\" , Voice for Ethical Research at Oxford, 16 January 2007. She continued throughout her life to advocate social reform and economic equality as the main way to overcome human disease,G√•lmark 2000, p. 1. living as a strict vegetarian and becoming a board member of the London Vegetarian Society. She was also active in Henry Stephens Salt's Humanitarian League. Leah Leneman writes that Lind af Hageby saw Darwin's theory of natural selection ‚Äì the Origin of Species had been published in 1859 ‚Äì as essential to the cause of animals, because it \\"brought about the decay of the old anthropocentric idea of man ... It taught that if there is this kinship physically between all living creatures, surely a responsibility rests upon us to see that these creatures, who have nerves as we have, who are made of the same flesh and blood as we are, who have minds differing from ours not in kind but in degree, should be protected ...\\" =Feminism= She was also active in several women's organizations, including the Women's Freedom League, arguing that the kinship she felt between humans and non-humans had implications for the enfranchisement and education of women, and that support for animals and women was connected to a \\"general undercurrent of rising humanity.\\" Indeed, the connection between rights for women and animals, neither of them regarded as persons during Lind af Hageby's lifetime, had been starkly illustrated a century earlier when Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792) was swiftly followed by a parody and reductio ad absurdum, Vindication of the Rights of Brutes, written anonymously by a Cambridge philosopher.Mary Ann Elston, \\"Women and Anti-vivisection in Victorian England, 1870‚Äì1900,\\" in Nicolaas A. Rupke (ed.), Vivisection in Historical Perspective, Routledge, 1987, p. 259ff. Following the lead of Frances Power Cobbe, Lind af Hageby regarded feminism and animal rights (and, in particular, vegetarianism), as strongly linked, seeing the advance of women as essential to civilization, and the tension between women and male scientists as a battle between feminism and machismo.Lynda Birke, \\"Supporting the underdog: Feminism, animal rights and citizenship in the work of Alice Morgan Wright and Edith Goode\\", Women's History Review, 9(4), 2000, p. 701. Craig Buettinger writes that feminism and anti-vivisection were strongly linked in the UK, where the comparison between the treatment of woman and animals at the hands of male scientists (and, indeed, their husbands) dominated the discourse. But in the United States, the antivisectionists based their need to protect animals on their duties as mothers and Christians, and did not see advancing women's rights as part of that.Craig Buettinger, \\"Women and antivivisection in late nineteenth century America\\", Journal of Social History, 30(4), Summer 1997, pp. 857‚Äì872. Lind af Hageby saw the spirituality and Christianity of the American anti- vivisectionists as directly tied to women's rights and progress in general. \\"[W]hat is called effeminacy by some ...,\\" she wrote, \\"is really greater spirituality ... and identical with the process of civilization itself.\\" Leneman writes that this view accounted for the involvement of feminists in the theosophy and other spiritual movements.Leneman 1997, pp. 227, 280‚Äì281. Lind af Hageby was herself involved with the London Spiritualist Alliance from 1935 until 1943.Mercy Phillimore, \\"Emilie Augusta Louise Lind-af-Hageby\\", obituary, Light, LXXXIV(3), 1964, p. 456. Animal sanctuary and later life In 1950, at the age of 73, she attended The Hague World Congress for the Protection of Animals. From 1954 she ran a 237-acre animal sanctuary at Ferne House near Shaftesbury, Dorset, an estate left to the Animal Defence and Anti- Vivisection Society by the Duchess of Hamilton on the latter's death in 1951; the Duchess, a friend of Lind af Hageby, had been using the estate as an animal sanctuary since the Second World War.Kean 1995, pp. 16‚Äì38; Andy McSmith, \\"Press dynasty is coming home from exile to a '¬£6m' mansion\\", The Observer, 13 June 1999.

He pursued his studies in his own country till nineteen, studying architecture with Antonio Gaidon in Bassano del Grappa and engraving, particularly stipple, which he practised in the studio of Antonio Suntach. He then moved to London, and completed his artistic education under Francesco Bartolozzi. In 1802 he married an English wife, and in 1805 he went to Russia, and spent two years in that country. He was patronized by the Emperor and the court, and his talents so highly appreciated, that he was refused a passport when he was desirous of returning to England. He, however, with the assistance of his friend, the Duke of Saracapriolo at that time Neapolitan ambassador, contrived to escape, disguised us a courier charged with dispatches. His departure was hastened by an accident that happened to a large cameo, Alexander and Olympia, from which he had to engrave a plate for the emperor. On his return to England he engraved several popular pictures by contemporary painters. Among these are, The Vision of S. Catherine, after Paolo Veronese; S. Sebastian after Jusepe Ribera; Leda after Leonardo da Vinci; and lastly, the Raising of Lazarus after Sebastiano del Piombo. Vendramini was a very accurate draughtsman, and frequently engraved from a picture without making a preparatory drawing. He died in London.

In the 1960s, she actively fought for women's rights and civil rights and she protested the Vietnam War. In college, she helped to establish a new chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Later, she became a member of the Weathermen, also called the Weather Underground, a militant leftist group. After leaving the Weather Underground, Bakke moved to Seattle, Washington. In Seattle, Bakke became a mother and worked as a nurse for many years. In 2006, her bio-memoir Miss Alcott's E-mail was published. Early life Christopher Lynn Bakke, otherwise known as \\"Kit\\" Bakke, was born in 1946. She grew up in a rural area near Seattle, Washington, with liberal parents and two younger brothers in a household that valued success in school above all else. Her father, Jack Bakke, was a physician with a passion for human biology, anatomy and the practice of medicine. Her mother, an active member of the League of Women Voters, championed various causes including voter education and keeping water supplies clean. All of her grandparents were college graduates. Kit Bakke lived in a highly intellectual environment in which political awareness and activism were highly valued. On the other hand, her family was also very traditional with the bread-winning dad and the stay at home mom who volunteered and helped the children strive for success in school. SDS After graduating from high school, Bakke went on to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. While there, she helped to establish a new Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) chapter at her college. As a member of SDS, she was involved with issues including civil rights, women's liberation, and anti-war demonstrations. Kathy Boudin, a key figure in the Weathermen and Diana Oughton, a member of the Weathermen who was killed in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, also went to Bryn Mawr College. Bakke and Boudin, along with other members of the SDS participated in various protests, for example, for 24 days she refused to eat or drink in protest against the war in Vietnam. Bakke also helped end the dress requirement of women being required to wear skirts in class, and helped to unionize the \\"live in maids\\". In her last undergraduate year, she shifted her focus to issues in the inner city rather than problems going on in the college. In the summer of 1969 at the SDS Convention in Chicago, SDS came apart. Bakke became part of a group of people, in SDS, labeled as the \\"Action Faction\\" or the \\"Weatherman\\", that broke away from the SDS. They believed that in order for a revolution to occur, they had to take militant action to provoke it. She graduated in 1968, but after earning her undergraduate degree in political science, Kit got a job as a journalist for a Seattle suburban newspaper with the intent of better understanding by getting an inside view of the \\"nominating conventions\\". When reporting on demonstrations, she took pictures, interviewed participants, and wrote articles. Cuba Bakke went to Havana, Cuba, for eight days in July 1969 to meet with the members of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Provisional Revolutionary Government to discuss the opposition movements going on in the United States. While accounts of the number of SDS participants vary, according to the FBI summary, 13 people, including Bernardine Dohrn, a key figure in the Weatherman went on the trip to Cuba. The experience was life changing for Kit and the others, according to a member of SDS. In Cuba, they learned the revolutionary tactics used by Cuba and other developing countries. This experience shaped the militant characteristic of the Weatherman. Only a few months after returning from Cuba, in October 1969, she participated in the Chicago riot termed the \\"Days of Rage\\" and was arrested. Bakke was also jailed in Cook County for three days after \\"some particularly aggressive street fighting\\". Life underground Bakke lived in political collectives in Oakland, Cleveland, New Mexico and the Westside of Chicago. While in Chicago, Bakke helped to print the Weatherman's publication, the New Left Notes. She says that in the communes she lived with \\"no more than ten or eleven...\\" of her fellow Weathermen. All competed with one another to give up their white middle-class benefits, \\"We held frequent Maoist criticism sessions, confessing our failures to each other, worrying about our weaknesses, and concocting na√Øve improvement strategies.\\" While she was in the Weather Underground the FBI amassed a file of over 400 pages on Kit Bakke and classified her as a \\"'Priority I Security Index Subject.'\\" In the early 1970s, Kit was pregnant with her first child, Maya, while she participated in a demonstration to protest against the Vietnam war. The demonstration got out of hand. Fleeing from the police, trying to avoid the teargas, police batons and the barrels of firearms, Kit decided to leave the Weather Underground. She was a political activist who got worn down by circumstance: \\"My revolutionary days in the passionate and violent Weather Underground were like the ruins of Pompeii, the sharp edges silted over by the ash of graduate school, marriage, kids in college, professional career, husband with ditto, vacations gardening, dinners in nice restaurants.\\" Life after Weathermen Bakke has earned two bachelor's degrees and two master's degrees: two nursing, one political science and one in public health. She moved to Seattle with her young daughter, Maya, to be close to family. She married in 1982. For thirteen years, Kit worked as an oncology nurse at Children's Regional Hospital in Seattle. Today, Bakke is involved with charities that tackle local issues, such as drug abuse and homelessness. Bakke remained underground for two years, and in that time cut off all contact with her parents. She has expressed guilt and regret about how her actions have affected her parents, but according to Flanigan, \\"Bakke says she doesn't have any regrets. ‚ÄòOf course we made mistakes, but everyone makes mistakes... I believe in putting yourself out there for the things you care about. If you don't do that, you're going to live a diminished life.'\\" In another interview, Bakke describes the Students for a Democratic Society as being arrogant bullies. Kit Bakke has raised two daughters and currently lives in Seattle with her husband. In 2006, Kit Bakke wrote a bio-memoir, Miss Alcott's E-mail. Notes References   C02.

He was posthumously awarded the George Cross, the highest award for heroism or courage not in the face of the enemy, that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. Matthews was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and was schooled there before moving to Victoria. He trained as a signalman in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve before joining the Militia in April 1939. Commissioned as an officer in the Australian Corps of Signals, Matthews transferred to the 8th Division of the Second Australian Imperial Force after the outbreak of World War II. Sent to Singapore with the rest of the 8th Division, Matthews served as the brigade signals officer of the 27th Brigade during the Malayan campaign and the Battle of Singapore, and at the surrender of Singapore he became a prisoner-of-war (POW). While in captivity he was awarded the Military Cross for displaying a high standard of courage, energy and ability while maintaining communications under fire in the earlier fighting. In July 1942, he was a member of a group of POWs sent to the Sandakan POW camp in British North Borneo. There, Matthews established an intelligence network, collecting information, weapons, medical supplies and radio parts, and made contact with organisations outside the camp, including Filipino guerrillas who assisted POWs to escape. In July 1943, members of his organisation were betrayed, and Matthews and others were arrested, beaten, tortured and starved by their Japanese captors. Matthews refused to provide any information on his organisation or its members to the Kenpeitai, and was executed by firing squad at Kuching, Sarawak, in March 1944. After the war, he was posthumously awarded the George Cross in recognition of his gallant and distinguished services while a POW in Japanese hands. Early life and career Lionel Colin Matthews was born in the Adelaide inner north-eastern suburb of Stepney on 15 August 1912, the third child of Edgar Roy Matthews, a plumber, and his wife Ann Elizabeth Jeffery. He attended East Adelaide Public School and Norwood High School. After graduation, he started work as a salesman in a department store. In his spare time he was an assistant scoutmaster at 1st Kensington Sea Scouts from 1931, and excelled at swimming and was a handy amateur boxer. In 1930 he enlisted in the part-time Militia and served with the 10th Battalion; then transferred to the Royal Australian Naval Reserve and trained as a signalman. On 26 December 1935 he married (Lorna) Myrtle Lane at St Matthew's Church, Kensington. Lorna was 21 at the time, and working as a packer. In 1937‚Äì1938, Lionel was engaged in social work at Pentridge Prison in Melbourne, a role sponsored by the Boy Scout's Association. After they moved to Melbourne, Matthews transferred back to the Militia and was posted to the 3rd Division Signals in April 1939. Lionel and Lorna had one child, Lionel David (known as David). World War II After the outbreak of World War II, Matthews was promoted to lieutenant on 18 January 1940. He transferred from the Militia to the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (Second AIF) at Caulfield, Victoria, on 10 June and was allocated to the 8th Division Signals. He was formally appointed as a lieutenant in the Second AIF on 1 July. Matthews underwent training in Victoria and later in New South Wales, including a course at the Army School of Signals. The 8th Division Signals embarked aboard the converted ocean liner for Singapore on 3 February 1941, arriving on 18 February. alt=a head and shoulders mugshot of a male in uniform =Malayan campaign= Matthews wore a clipped moustache, and was nicknamed \\"The Duke\\" because of his physical resemblance to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. He was posted as the signals officer for the 27th Brigade, which arrived in Malaya in August. The Australians formed part of a defensive garrison that had been established due to growing concerns about a possible war with Japan. Under the command of Brigadier Duncan Maxwell, the brigade moved to Jemaluang, as part of the 8th Division under Major General Gordon Bennett. Consisting of only two brigades, the division was tasked with securing the eastern part of Johore. Bennett pushed the 22nd Brigade forward around Mersing and held the 27th Brigade back as his reserve. In December 1941 the Japanese invaded Malaya, and the 27th Brigade was committed to the Allied resistance in the Malayan campaign, although the initial stages of the fighting were in the north, away from the Australians' area of responsibility. As the Japanese quickly advanced down the Malay Peninsula, the Australian force was reorganised. While the 22nd Brigade assumed control of eastern Johore, the 27th moved to the west where it was joined by several British and Indian units to create an ad hoc formation called \\"Westforce\\" under Bennett's command. Throughout January 1942, the brigade fought delaying actions around the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, including the Battle of Gemas and the wider Battle of Muar, as the Allies were pushed back towards Singapore. The Japanese advance continued, and eventually the 27th Brigade withdrew to Simpang Renggam through Yong Peng and Ayer Hitam. As efforts were made to delay the Japanese, the brigade headquarters temporarily took several British units under its command. The brigade carried out delaying actions before withdrawing to Yong Peng, and then fought to maintain control of the crossroad around Ayer Hitam. Matthews was promoted to captain on 21 January. On 28 January, further fighting occurred around the Namazie rubber plantation, where a strong Japanese attack was repelled, forcing the Japanese to carry out a flanking action that exploited a gap in the line to the west. This nearly rolled through the 27th Brigade, forcing it to withdraw. By the end of January the Allied forces were withdrawn to Singapore, and defensive preparations began to repel a Japanese assault across the Johore Strait. =Battle of Singapore= After the Malayan campaign, the 27th Brigade initially took part in the defence of Singapore by defending the Causeway area. The Japanese assault began on the night of 8/9 February, and fell largely on the 22nd Brigade's sector, where two Japanese divisions landed during the Battle of Sarimbun Beach. The brigade's troops managed to hold their area, fending off some flanking efforts by the Japanese along the Kranji River, and the 2/29th Battalion was sent south to help bolster the 22nd Brigade. The following night, another Japanese landing fell in the 27th Brigade's area, and heavy fighting took place during the Battle of Kranji. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties from the defenders' machine guns and mortars, as well as burning oil that had been sluiced across the water. The attacking troops managed to establish a beachhead and the 27th Brigade's headquarters was subsequently cut off from its battalions, as the Allies were pushed back towards the centre of the island. As the Allied perimeter continued to shrink around the town, the 8th Division units were brought together around Tanglin Barracks, where they remained until the garrison surrendered on 15 February. =Prisoner-of-war= Matthews was initially interned in the Changi prisoner-of-war camp on Singapore. In May, captured elements of Malaya Command authorised the award of the Military Cross to Matthews for his actions at Gemas and on Singapore. The citation, which was not officially gazetted until 8 January 1946, read: In July, \\"B\\" Force, consisting of nearly 1,500 Australian prisoners-of-war (POWs), including Matthews, was sent to the Sandakan POW camp in occupied British North Borneo. Once they arrived, Matthews set up a complex intelligence-gathering network that was linked to several key figures; including J. P. Taylor, an Australian doctor in charge of the local hospital, as well as Europeans interned on nearby Berhala Island. Matthews and his second-in-command, Lieutenant R. G. Wells, also established links with Asians, some of whom were Chinese, along with members of the British North Borneo Constabulary, which was operating under Japanese supervision. The police passed them information, maps, a revolver, radio parts and medical supplies. Their smuggling of medical supplies saved dozens of lives. By September 1942, Matthews and Wells had consolidated and expanded their organisation. All intelligence gathered was passed to Matthews and collated. He managed to make contact with Filipino resistance fighters operating on the Sulu Archipelago in the south-west Philippines, who assisted Australian POWs to escape. The Japanese transferred the civilian internees from Berhala Island to the Batu Lintang camp near Kuching in Sarawak in January 1943. Matthews had gained the trust of the Governor of North Borneo, Robert Smith, who had been interned nearby and, when the civilian internees departed he was placed in effective command of the British North Borneo Constabulary despite being a POW. While he had several opportunities to escape, Matthews decided to remain with his fellow POWs and continue running his covert organisation at great risk to himself. He made plans to rise up against the Japanese if the Allies landed in Borneo, and initiated the building of a radio transmitter. In July 1943, four Chinese members of Matthews' intelligence network were betrayed to the Japanese. Tortured, they confessed to providing radio parts. The Japanese then arrested Matthews, Wells, Taylor and other members of the organisation. They were beaten, tortured and starved as part of their interrogation, then transported to Kuching. Matthews was sentenced to death, along with two members of the British North Borneo Constabulary and six other Asians. Throughout their confinement, Matthews had encouraged the other suspects, and had refused to divulge any information about their activities. Matthews was executed by a firing squad on 2 March 1944, refusing the offer of a blindfold. As well as the Military Cross, he was entitled to the 1939‚Äì1945 Star, the Pacific Star, the Defence Medal, the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945, and the Australia Service Medal 1939‚Äì1945. Matthews' body was later exhumed and reinterred in the Labuan War Cemetery. Matthews' older brother Geoffrey commanded the 9th Battalion in the latter stages of World War II, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. George Cross alt=a plain silver cross with circular medallion in the centre depicting the effigy of St George and the Dragon, surrounded by the words \\"FOR GALLANTRY\\" After the war, on 25 November 1947, Matthews was posthumously awarded the George Cross for his actions while a POW. The citation read: alt=an image of a bronze plaque listing highly decorated service personnel of World War II Matthews' Military Cross was received by his nine-year-old son, David, from the Governor-General, William McKell, at Government House, Adelaide, in late November. David also received his George Cross from the Governor of South Australia, Lieutenant General Sir Willoughby Norrie, in Adelaide on 4 October 1949. A fund was established to pay for David's education. Matthews' George Cross, Military Cross and service medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

Usually this occurs when the virus has modulated one or several of the host cellular intrinsic defenses and the host immune system. The permissive state of a host has now been determined to be the primary factor in determining whether a virus will cause pathological symptoms in a host.N.J. Dimmock et al. \\"Introduction to Modern Virology, 6th edition.\\" Blackwell Publishing, 2007.  Susceptible versus permissive  A virus can enter a susceptible cell, but it cannot replicate. A virus can both enter and replicate in a permissive cell. The significance between the difference of the two has now been elucidated with study of the rabbit-lethal myxoma virus. Many species of rabbit cells in culture (without the presence of any antiviral defenses that would normally be in a host) can be infected by the myxoma virus, causing infection and cell death. However, inoculation of the myxoma virus in many species of rabbit shows that only one species of rabbit is affected, the rest being completely unharmed by the virus (lack of even viral shedding). This has been determined to be a result of the myxoma virus's inability to suppress other species' interferon expression, and hence resulting in the interferon in turn suppressing the myxoma virus. This is a result of the positive susceptibility of many species of rabbit's cells, but negative permissibility of all but one of the rabbit species' cells.Nash P. et al. \\"Immunomodulation by viruses: the myxoma virus story.\\" Immunol Rev. 1999 Apr;168:103-20.

On 10 October 1923 he appointed two members of the Communist Party as members of the government. On 27 October 1923, German Chancellor Gustav Stresemann issued an ultimatum demanding a dismissal of the Communist ministers. Zeigner refused to comply and, two days later, was deposed as prime minister by the President of Germany Friedrich Ebert (SPD) under the authority of Article 48 of the Weimar constitution. Zeigner was replaced by a commissioner. On 21 November 1923 Zeigner was arrested for alleged corruption in office and sentenced in the spring of 1924 to three years in prison, from which he was released on probation in August 1925.

Originating in Native American cuisine, they are a traditional sweet and savory snack in the Southern United States, as well as Indonesia where they are known as perkedel jagung or bakwan jagung. History Native Americans had been using ground corn (maize) as food for thousands of yearsTeosinte was known in Rio Balsas (Mexico) valley from 9000 BP and was introduced in what is now the United States by the Anasazis circa 1000 AD before European explorers arrived in the New World. Corn-based products, such as corn flatbread, arepa and cornbread were staple foods in Pre-Columbian Americas. Native Americans did not use deep frying techniques, however, which require ample supplies of cooking oil as well as equipment in which the oil can be heated to high temperatures. European settlers learned recipes and processes for corn dishes from Native Americans, and soon devised their own cornmeal-based variations of European breads made from grains available on that continent. The corn fritter probably was invented in the Southern United States, whose traditional cuisine contains a lot of deep fried foods, none more famous perhaps than Southern fried chicken. On the other side of the world, maize seeds from the Americas were introduced into Southeast Asia in the late 16th century through Spanish and Portuguese traders. The plant thrived in the tropical climate of Indonesia, and soon became a staple food plant in drier areas of central and southeastern Indonesia, since it requires much less water than wet rice. Coconut and palm oil have been essential elements of Indonesian cuisine for centuries. The deep fried technique using palm oil was probably borrowed from Portuguese colonists; and Indonesia has its own type of corn fritter, called perkedel jagung or bakwan jagung. Corn fritters at an event in Sonoma, California Ingredients =Southern United States= Traditional corn fritters in the American South use corn kernels, egg, flour, milk, and melted butter. They can be deep fried, shallow fried, baked, and may be served with jam, fruit, honey, or cream. They may also be made with creamed corn, baked, and served with maple syrup. Corn fritters can be made to have a similar appearance to, and thus be mistaken for, johnnycake. =Indonesia= Bakwan jagung, Indonesian corn fritters Indonesian corn fritters are not sweet but savoury. They have a more granulated texture, as the corn kernels are not finely ground and blended into the dough, so they retain their kernel shapes. The fritter is made from fresh corn kernels, wheat flour, rice flour, celery, scallion, eggs, shallots, garlic, salt and pepper, and deep fried in coconut oil. They are a popular snack and are often served as an appetizer.

CIRC.626-1969 A sewing table or work table is a table or desk used for sewing. Generally it has large amounts of space and a full set of sewing tools. Nearby there will be a chair and a waste bin. A common attachment is a dropleaf to give expanded space. Other attachments can be a cloth bag for storing sewing materials, drawers, or shelves.  History  The sewing table originated in England around 1770 and was adopted in post- Revolutionary War America. Prior to the use of the sewing table, women kept needlework in a basket or bag. It was designed to provide a surface and storage for a gentlewoman‚Äôs needlework or other leisure actives, including basket-weaving, crochet, macram√© and painting as it was customary for women to gather and take up work around the table. The majority of tables created in the U.S. during this time were of Sheraton or Empire style and constructed of mahogany. In the mid-1800s, sewing machines were developed and the sewing table was altered to accommodate a machine. The Singer cabinet works was established in 1868 as a contractor constructing the Singer Company‚Äôs sewing tables in South Bend, Indiana.

Worth 30 to 150 dollars A classic hard times token, sometimes referred to as a \\"not cent\\" Hard-times tokens are American large or half cent- sized copper tokens, struck from about 1833 through 1843, serving as unofficial currency. These privately made pieces, comprising merchant, political and satirical pieces, were used during a time of political and financial crisis in the United States. Today, hard-times tokens are collectible and usually very affordable as coins or as political history. Background 1837 \\"Not One Cent for Tribute\\" token (HT#293) In 1832, President Andrew Jackson ran for re-election and called for the abolition of the Second Bank of the United States. While he won the election, he worked to weaken the bank before the charter expired in 1836. Without the Bank of the United States, state banks attempted to fill the paper money gap and issued a large number of bank notes, which fueled inflation. Hoping to halt the inflation and speculation in public lands, Jackson and his Treasury secretary, Levi Woodbury, issued the Specie Circular on July 11, 1836. The circular simply stated that as of August 15 1836, banks and others who received public money were required to accept only gold and silver coins in payment for public lands. Instead of the intended results, the circular spelled the end of a time of economic prosperity. The circular set into motion a panic, and the public began hoarding specie. Without specie to pay out, banks and merchants began having financial troubles. It wasn't too long before the effects of Jackson's decision were felt across the nation as banks and businesses failed, and a depression ensued. By this time, Jackson's vice president, Martin Van Buren, was the elected president in office. The period of economic hardship, the Panic of 1837, during Van Buren's presidency came to be known as the \\"Hard Times\\".

Once replication has been completed and the host cell is exhausted of all resources in making viral progeny, the viruses may begin to leave the cell by several methods.N.J. Dimmock et al. \\"Introduction to Modern Virology, 6th edition.\\" Blackwell Publishing, 20hif ilikr 07. The term is used to refer to shedding from a single cell, shedding from one part of the body into another part of the body, Massachusetts Department of Public Health ‚Äì Rabies Control Plan ‚Äì Chapter 1: General Information ‚Äì \\"Definitions as Used in this Document [...] Shedding ‚Äì The release of rabies virus from the salivary glands into the saliva.\\" and shedding from bodies into the environment where the viruses may infect other bodies. Via budding \\"Budding\\" through the cell envelope ‚Äîin effect, borrowing from the cell membrane to create the virus's own viral envelope‚Äîis most effective for viruses that need an envelope in the first place. These include enveloped viruses such as HIV, HSV, SARS or smallpox. When beginning the budding process, the viral nucleocapsid cooperates with a certain region of the host cell membrane. During this interaction, the glycosylated viral envelope protein inserts itself into the cell membrane. In order to successfully bud from the host cell, the nucleocapsid of the virus must form a connection with the cytoplasmic tails of envelope proteins. Though budding does not immediately destroy the host cell, this process will slowly use up the cell membrane and eventually lead to the cell's demise. This is also how antiviral responses are able to detect virus-infected cells. Budding has been most extensively studied for viruses of eukaryotes. However, it has been demonstrated that viruses infecting prokaryotes of the domain Archaea also employ this mechanism of virion release. Via apoptosis Virus forcing cell to undergo apoptosis to infect macrophages. Animal cells are programmed to self-destruct when they are under viral attack or damaged in some other way. By forcing the cell to undergo apoptosis or cell suicide, release of progeny into the extracellular space is possible. However, apoptosis does not necessarily result in the cell simply popping open and spilling its contents into the extracellular space. Rather, apoptosis is usually controlled and results in the cell's genome being chopped up, before apoptotic bodies of dead cell material clump off the cell to be absorbed by macrophages. This is a good way for a virus to get into macrophages either to infect them or simply travel to other tissues in the body. Although this process is primarily used by non- enveloped viruses, enveloped viruses may also use this. HIV is an example of an enveloped virus that exploits this process for the infection of macrophages. Via exocytosis Virus leaving via exocytosis. Viruses also leave cells through exocytosis, in which the host cell is not destroyed. Viruses that have envelopes that come from nuclear or endosomal membranes can leave the cell via exocytosis. Viral progeny are synthesized within the cell and the host cell's transport system is used to enclose them in vesicles; the vesicles of virus progeny are carried to the cell membrane and then released into the extracellular space. This is used primarily by non-enveloped viruses, although enveloped viruses display this too. An example is the use of recycling viral particle receptors in the enveloped varicella-zoster virus. Contagiousness A person with a viral disease is contagious if they are shedding viruses. The rate at which an infected person sheds viruses over time is therefore of considerable interest. Some viruses such as HSV-2 (which produces genital herpes) can cause asymptomatic shedding and therefore spread undetected from person to person, as no fever or other hints reveal the contagious nature of the host during this kind of shedding. . Another crucial component to viral shedding is whether or not the age of the individual infected plays a role in how long the individual will shed the virus. The University of Milan conducted a study on the A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus to determine if the shedding of the novel pandemic occurs for a longer time in youth than in adults. Only children who had symptoms that appeared two days before hospital attendance, were under 15 years of age, and did not face any serious complications were included in the study. After physical exams and nasopharyngeal samples from all of the positive cases, the results determined that the length of viral shedding (in days) does not correspond to age. The virus shedding was not related to age because there was no difference between the children in the different age groups. Contagiousness in this situation could last up to 15 days, which means that when viral diseases infect much of a localized population, the proper quarantine precautions need to take place to prevent further spread of the virus through viral shedding. .

It consists of a handle with a circular blade that rotates, thus the tool's name. Rotary cutter blades are very sharp, can be resharpened, and are available in different sizes: usually smaller blades are used to cut small curves, while larger blades are used to cut to straight lines and broad curves. Several layers of fabric can be cut simultaneously with a sharp (fresh) blade, making it easier to cut out patchwork pieces of the same shape and size than with scissors. Quilters use rotary cutters with specially designed templates and rulers made of approximately 1/8-inch thick clear or color-tinted plastic. History The first rotary cutter was introduced by the Olfa company in 1979 for garment making, however, it was quickly adopted by quilters. Prior to the invention of the rotary cutter, quilters traced handmade templates of the necessary shapes onto the wrong side of the fabric and added 1/4-inch seam allowances all around. Templates were often handmade of (cereal box type) cardboard and the pencil wore down the edges with repeated tracings, rendering them inaccurate; new templates would be made several times until all the patchwork pieces were cut. Pieces were usually cut one at a time with dressmaking scissors, which were often heavy and had long blades that were designed for cutting large pieces for garments but were cumbersome to use for cutting small pieces for patchwork. The rotary cutter gained almost immediate widespread use among quilters after its introduction and, along with the accompanying development of strip techniques, revolutionized quilting. Today there are many companies making rotary cutters. Cutters come in a variety of handle types and some include specialty blades to cut curved or zigzagged lines. Most have retractable blades that can be locked to prevent injury.

Marin based on the 1935 novel Dark Dame by Wilson Collison. The rights to the novel were originally purchased by MGM for a Jean Harlow film, but Harlow died in 1937 before a shooting script could be completed. The project was put on hold until 1939, when Ann Sothern was hired to star in the film with Robert Young as leading man. It was the first of 10 films starring Sothern as Maisie Ravier. In Mary C. McCall, Jr.'s screenplay, Maisie is stranded penniless in a small Wyoming town, takes a job at a ranch, and gets caught in a web of romantic entanglements. Plot When Brooklyn burlesque showgirl Maisie Ravier arrives at a small Wyoming town, she finds her new employer has folded after a single performance, leaving her stranded and nearly penniless. She persuades Rico to hire her for his midway shooting gallery. Her first customer is the unfriendly \\"Slim\\" Martin, the manager of a ranch. Slim accidentally drops his wallet full of money. Rico picks it up and leaves town. Slim has Maisie arrested for theft, but when a search finds she only has 15 cents, he admits his mistake. The deputy sheriff informs Maisie that as a vagrant, she must leave town by midnight, so she hides in the back of Slim's truck. When Slim returns to the ranch, he is displeased to discover the stowaway. He has Maisie driven to the railway station the next morning. Maisie meets the ranch owners, Cliff and Sybil Ames, who arrive on the train. Maisie fast-talks herself into being hired as Sybil's maid. The Ameses are trying to rebuild their marriage after Cliff discovered Sybil's extramarital affair with Richard \\"Ray\\" Raymond. Maisie's warm personality gradually overcomes Slim's hostility. Slim's demeanor is the result of past hard luck: he confessed to embezzlement to protect his girlfriend and spent a year in prison, only to discover after his release that she had run off with another man. Maisie also becomes friends with Cliff. Maisie and Cliff volunteer to drive needed supplies to the old ranch house but their car overturns and Cliff is pinned under the wreck. Maisie limps to the house and walks in on Sybil kissing Ray Raymond. Maisie sends the ranch hands to rescue Cliff, who is not seriously injured. Slim asks Maisie to marry him, and she gleefully accepts. Sybil privately confronts Maisie about Ray. Maisie informs her that she has told no one, to spare Cliff's feelings, but Sybil remains fearful that Maisie may expose her affair. Sybil lies to Slim that Maisie has been pursuing Cliff romantically, and that she only settled for Slim after she realized that Cliff would not leave her. Slim confronts Maisie. Maisie is insulted by Slim's lack of trust, so she breaks their engagement and leaves. Cliff commits suicide after realizing his wife is still unfaithful. The death is ruled a homicide, and Slim is accused of the crime. Maisie rushes to the courtroom but she is unable to convince the judge that Slim is innocent. However, Cliff had mailed a letter to his lawyer to deliver to Maisie. The letter details the reasons for Cliff's suicide, exonerating Slim, and names Maisie as Cliff's sole heir. Maisie inherits the ranch and plenty of money to run it. Cast Lobby card showing Young and Sothern Reception Frank Nugent, critic for The New York Times, wrote, \\"Don't let all this advertising talk about 'Maisie, the Explosive Blonde' ... mystify you too unbearably. It's just Ann Sothern, who is probably already one of your favorite flouncers, flouncing through an unconventional Western comedy ... Incidentally, the character of Maisie is, as promised, 'explosive.' Miss Sothern, hitherto a reasonably restrained actress, throws left hooks, gags and fits of temperament with surprising abandon.\\" References External links  1939 films 1939 comedy films American films American comedy films American black-and-white films English-language films Films based on American novels Films directed by Edwin L.

It was inspired by Ernest Thompson Seton's Woodcraft Indians, and Seton was its honorary Grand Chieftain. Whilst largely being contemporary to Baden-Powell's Scouting movement, it differed from it in that it does not have the perceived military overtones of Scouting, instead focusing on the virtues of kindness, fellowship and woodcraft. The Order was small compared to Scouts, having only 1,200 members by 1926. By the 1950s it had ceased to have a major public presence. It still exists (2016) as a semi-formal network of personal friends with historic family links to the original formal organisation, with little interest in publicity and few surviving overt connections with the Woodcraft Folk or the Forest School Camps. The Order accepted many premises of Neopaganism. It has been suggested by writer Steve Wilson that it provided the basis for the New Forest coven, and through that the Neopagan religion of Wicca. History =Founding= Westlake was a naturalist, anthropologist and traveller of Quaker upbringing, however in 1909 he began to fault Quakerism and extol the \\"old gods\\" of paganism. He was inspired by authors such as Edward Carpenter, Nietzsche, Havelock Ellis, Jane Ellen Harrison, Tylor and Frazer, and saw the Order as saving people from \\"the cul de sac of intellectualized religion\\" and reviving the \\"greater Hellas\\" of modern civilisation. He saw women as incarnations of God, to be \\"worshipped in spirit and in truth\\"; he revered the Jack-in-the-Green, which he considered to be the English equivalent of Dionysus, and held that the \\"Trinity of Woodcraft\\" consisted of Pan, Artemis and Dionysus.Hutton, pp. 164-5. The first folkmoot ceremony of the Order was held at Sandy Balls, Westlake's estate on the northern edge of the New Forest, on Lammas 1921, with the sacred fire lit by four people dressed in colours of the elements of each quarter, bringing greetings from the elemental powers in succession from north round to west. Despite these pagan themes, Westlake did not consider they were departing from Christianity, and claimed that \\"one must be a good pagan before one can be a good Christian\\". He held that after his resurrection Jesus Christ had become dissolved into nature, and that by recognising the divinity inherent in nature people would come closer to Christ.Hutton, p. 166. Consequently, the Order promoted a \\"mystical and animist\\" view of nature.Steven J. Sutcliffe, Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices, Routledge, London, 2002, p.41 The Order had a considerable influence in the founding of the Forest School Camps movement. There is little evidence of interactions between the Order and the Woodcraft Folk, which was also a breakaway from the Kibbo Kift and was similarly inspired by Seton. This may have been because the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry was non-political and had a mainly affluent middle-class membership (e.g. Westlake owned a country estate) while the Woodcraft Folk, which styled itself 'The Movement for Workers Children' in the 1920s, was predominantly a socialist working-class organisation at the time. =After Westlake= After Westlake's death in a motoring accident in 1922, the role of British Chief of the Order fell to Harry Byngham, who subsequently changed his name to Dion, short for Dionysus. Unlike Westlake, Dion Byngham found no attraction in Christianity, and zealously promoted paganism, naturism and phallic worship as a veneration of the life force. He started publishing an Order periodical called The Pinecone, which contained many provocative items, including a nude Dionysus on the cover of one issue, a photograph of a nude Byngham and his semi-nude girlfriend in Grecian dress, and a verse play by Victor Benjamin Neuburg, who also introduced Byngham to the ideas of the famous occultist Aleister Crowley. All this brought Byngham into strife with many of the Christian members of the Order, which was primarily aimed at children and had, by its pacifist stance, particularly appealed to Quaker families as an alternative to Scouting. In 1924 Byngham was replaced as editor and in 1925 he was suspended from the Council of Chiefs after posing nude with his girlfriend for press photographs to promote nudism.Hutton, pp. 166-8. Between 1922 and 1927 the rituals of the order continued to evolve along Masonic and quasi-Masonic lines, adopting elaborate titles and ritual equipment. In 1928 a compromise was accepted between the pagan- and the Christian-inclined members whereby the order would promote both the sanctity of nature and Christian ethics, while criticising the \\"repressive\\" aspects of Christianity. However membership fell. In 1929 the Society of Friends formally withdrew support for the Order, and by 1930 there were only 400 members remaining. In 1934 Aubrey Westlake, the son of Ernest, resigned as Chieftain, and in 1935 he left the order, depriving it of its meeting place at Sandy Balls.Hutton, pp. 168-170. Steve Wilson argues that some of the pagan-inclined members split off to form the New Forest coven, which became the origin of the religion of Wicca. =Contemporary= Hutton stated in 1999 that \\"The Order continues to survive with a stable but small membership\\".Hutton, p. 170. In the 1990s Martin Westlake, son of Aubrey and grandson of Ernest, allowed the Order to celebrate its anniversary at Sandy Balls estate again.Wilson, Steve (1996). \\"Woodcrafting the Art of Magic\\". Aisling #8. A website in the Order's name exists and was last updated in Feb 2015. http://www.orderofwoodcraftchivalry.org.uk/ It seems to be mainly used by existing members to post photographs, etc, and contains little to attract potential new members. The Order survives as a small network of personal friends linked to the earlier formal organisation. The OWC is a co-host, together with the Liga Lesni Moudrosti (The Woodcraft League of the Czech Republic), of the Blue Sky! World Woodcraft Gathering which takes place every three years alternately in the UK and the Czech Republic. Started in 1996, the gathering in 2017 will be the 8th meeting and will be held in the UK.

Later, from 1871 to 1873, Peterson returned to the Scandinavian Mission as the Mission president, where he guided the missionary work in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. In 1867, Peterson was asked to move to Ephraim, Utah to be a bishop of the church there. Peterson was instrumental in assisting the Latter-day Saints make peace with the Native Americans in Sanpete County.

Eleanor Percy married Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, who was beheaded in 1521 on false charges of plotting to overthrow the king, Henry VIII. As a result, the Dukedom of Buckingham and estates were forfeited, and her children lost their inheritance. Biography Eleanor Percy was born about 1474 in Leconfield, Yorkshire. On 14 December 1490, at about sixteen years of age, Eleanor married Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, who was five years old when his father, the rebellious 2nd Duke of Buckingham, was attainted and executed for high treason. Edward Stafford's mother, Catherine Woodville, went on to marry Jasper Tudor, the first Duke of Bedford and thirdly, Richard Wingfield. Two years after his father's execution, when Henry VII ascended the throne, the attainder was reversed, and the title and estates of Edward's father were restored to him. At seven, Edward became the third Duke of Buckingham and also the ward of King Henry VII's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort. After Edward's death, Eleanor remarried to John Audley. Her second marriage was childless.

Description  The red hickory is generally encountered as a medium-sized tree, capable of growing to in height.Plants For A Future: Carya ovalis The single trunk is straight and often continues for the entire height of the tree, although sometimes splits into several large limbs once the canopy has been breached. The branches are strong, stout and long, ascending in the upper crown and drooping in the lower crown; the branches around mid- height are more or less horizontal. This creates a broad, thick, column-shaped form that casts dense shade. Individuals have been known to live from 100‚Äì250 years of age. the thin shelled nuts of red hickory The leaves are pinnately compound, typically producing 5-9 leaflets (7 being the most common). The terminal leaflet is often the largest, with the auxiliary leaflets decreasing in size from the tip to the base of the rachis. Leaflets are broadest above or at their median length, with finely serrated margins. They are dark green and smooth or glaucous above and paler and finely pubescent underneath. the rachis of the leaves are usually bright red or purple in color, a distinctive feature of red hickory that helps to separate it from pignut hickory.Ohio Trees Bulletin 700-00: Carya ‚Äì Hickory The bark of a mature red hickoryThe bark of mature trees is grey, composed of tight, flat-topped intersecting ridges that can appear quite blocky but are generally strap-like. Occasionally, the ridges may separate from the trunk in peeling strips, loose at both ends, a trait characteristic of Shagbark and Shellbark Hickories. Young, vigorously growing trees are more prone to producing peeling bark than mature individuals. Like all hickories, the fruit is a small round or slightly elliptical nut, born singly or in groups of 2-3 on the ends of bearing branches. When immature, the nut is encased in a thin, green husk with 4 distinct seams. Upon maturity (late September to mid-October) the husk changes from being green, fleshy and flexible to dark brown and very brittle. The seams then split from the base upwards and may or may not completely separate from the ripe nut. The nut itself is smooth, tan to beige in color and has 4 shallow ridges from the seams. The inner kernel is very oily and varies in flavor from bitter and unpalatable to mildly sweet. For such as small nut, the shell is thick and the kernel difficult to extract. These nuts are relished by countless wildlife species, including many rodents and birds, as well as raccoons and wild turkeys. The flowers emerge in the spring at the same times as the developing leaves (early to late May). The male flowers are long, green, inconspicuous drooping catkins that develop between the base of the petiole and the developing twig. The female flowers are bizarre looking, with a tuft of sticky green tissue emerging from a swollen base. These develop individually or in groups at the end of a new twig, after the expanding leaves. All hickories are self-infertile and monoecious.

He was made a cardinal in 1921. Biography Giovanni Tacci Porcelli was born in Mogliano to Professor Luigi Tacci and Maria Monti Guarnieri. He studied at the seminary in Tolentino and earned doctorates in theology and canon law at the Pontifical Roman Seminary. To prepare for a career in the diplomatic service he attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. He was ordained a priest on 19 September 1886. He then did pastoral work in Fermo and Rome until 1895 and was raised to the rank of Domestic Chamberlain of His Holiness. He also served as Dean of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, a member of the Commission of Pontifical Schools, and an ecclesiasticus of several monasteries. On 18 March 1895, he was appointed Bishop of Citt√† della Pieve by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on 5 May from Cardinal Amilcare Malagola. He was named Apostolic Delegate to Constantinople and Patriarchal Vicar for Latin-rite Catholics there on 19 December 1904, after being named Titular Archbishop of Nicaea. He was appointed Nuncio to Belgium on 31 December 1907 and then Internuncio to the Netherlands on 18 March 1911.

The organisation was established in 1931 by a group inspired in part by the example of the Scottish Protestant League. It initially had some links with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), and UUP members such as James Hanna McCormick attended its meetings.Graham Walker, A History of the Ulster Unionist Party: Protest, Pragmatism And Pessimism The UPL complained that, during a time of economic depression, some jobs were being given to Roman Catholics, proposing that unemployed Protestants should be given priority. It also raised concerns that some Catholics were allowed to work in organisations such as the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and noted that some Orange Order marches were occasionally banned by the government of Northern Ireland. In 1932, the UPL campaigned against the Outdoor Relief Strike, a cross-community protest for improved unemployment benefits. They claimed that the strike was a cloak for \\"the communist Sinn Fein element to attempt to start a revolution in our province\\", and congratulated the government on breaking up the strike.Michael Farrell, Northern Ireland: The Orange State The Catholic Truth Society organised a Eucharistic Congress at the Ulster Hall in 1934, but this was called off after the UPL organised large protests in central Belfast. Two demonstrators, UPL leader Dorothy Harnett and Presbyterian minister Samuel Hanna, were convicted of incitement to disorder.Oliver P. Rafferty, Catholicism in Ulster, 1603-1983: An Interpretative History By the mid-1930s, the UPL was in sharp opposition to the ruling Ulster Unionist Party, which they regarded as untrustworthy and soft on Catholics. Members of the group were active in anti-Catholic riots in 1935, and later in the year, some members gained seats in local elections. The group announced a new policy on Catholics: \\"neither to talk with, nor walk with, neither to buy nor sell, borrow nor lend, take nor give, or to have any dealings with them at all, nor for employers to employ them nor employees to work with them.\\" The UUP were concerned at the growing Protestant discontent and sought to move closer to the Orange Order. By the 1938 Northern Ireland general election, the UPL was in decline, and the main loyalist challenge to the UUP came from the Ulster Progressive Unionist Association, although independent Unionist John William Nixon who had become close to the UPL retained his seat, and the UPL candidate in Belfast Willowfield took 34.9% of the votes cast.Northern Ireland Parliamentary Election Results: Boroughs: Belfast The UPL remained active until the start of World War II.

It seeks to explain two related issues: # The process by which oral poets improvise poetry. # The reasons for orally improvised poetry (or written poetry deriving from traditions of oral improvisation) having the characteristics that it does. The key idea of the theory is that poets have a store of formulas (a formula being 'an expression that is regularly used, under the same metrical conditions, to express a particular essential idea')Milman Parry, L‚Äôepith√®t traditionnelle dans Hom√®re (Paris, 1928), p. 16; cf. Albert B. Lord, The singer of tales (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1960), p. 4 and that by linking the formulas in conventionalised ways, poets can rapidly compose verse. In the hands of Milman Parry and Albert Lord, the approach transformed the study of ancient and medieval poetry and oral poetry generally. The main exponent and developer of their approaches was John Miles Foley. Homeric verse In Homeric verse, a phrase like eos rhododaktylos (\\"rosy fingered dawn\\") or oinops pontos (\\"winedark sea\\") occupies a certain metrical pattern that fits, in modular fashion, into the six-colon Greek hexameter, which aids the aoidos or bard in extemporaneous composition. Moreover, such phrases would be subject to internal substitutions and adaptations, permitting flexibility in response to narrative and grammatical needs: podas okus axilleus (\\"swift footed Achilles\\") is metrically equivalent to koruthaiolos ektor (\\"glancing-helmed Hector\\"). Formulas can also be combined into type-scenes, longer, conventionalised depictions of generic actions in epic like the steps taken to arm oneself or to prepare a ship for sea. Work of Parry and successors Oral-formulaic theory was originally developed, principally by Parry in the 1920s, to explain how the Homeric epics could have been passed down through many generations purely through word of mouth and why its formulas appeared as they did. His work was influential (see Homeric scholarship#Oral Theory and Homeric Question). The locus classicus for oral-formulaic poetry, however, was established by the work of Parry and his student Lord on the Serbian oral epic poetry of what was then of Yugoslavia, where oral-formulaic composition could be observed and recorded ethnographically. Formulaic variation is apparent, for example, in the following lines: :a besjedi od Orasca Tale (\\"But spoke of Orashatz Tale\\") :a besjedi Mujagin Halile (\\"But spoke Mujo's Halil\\"). Lord, and more prominently Francis Peabody Magoun, also applied the theory to Old English poetry (principally Beowulf) in which formulaic variation such as the following is prominent: :Hrothgar mathelode helm Scildinga (\\"Hrothgar spoke, protector of the Scildings\\") :Beowulf mathelode bearn Ecgtheowes (\\"Beowulf spoke, son of Ecgtheow\\") Magoun thought that formulaic poetry was necessarily oral in origin. That sparked a major and ongoing debate over the extent to which Old English poetry, which survives only in written form, should be seen as, in some sense, oral poetry. The oral-formulaic theory of composition has now been applied to a wide variety of languages and works. A provocative new application of oral-formulaic theory is its use in explaining the origin of at least some parts of the Quran.Bannister, Andrew G. 2014. An Oral-Formulaic Study of the Qur'an. Lanham, Maryland: Lexington Books. Oral-Formulaic theory has also been applied to early Japanese worksTokita, Alison McQueen. 2015. Japanese Singers of Tales: Ten Centuries of Performed Narrative. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing. The oral-formulaic theory has also been helpfully applied to the Olonko epic of the Sakha people of Siberia.Harris, Robin. 2017. Storytelling in Siberia: The Olonkho Epic in a Changing World. Urbana- Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press. =Precursors of Parry= Before Parry, at least two other folklorists also noted the use of formulas among the epic tale singers of Yugoslavian (known as guslars), (something acknowledged by Parry):Parry, Adam, ed. 1971. The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry, Oxford: Clarendon Press, p.270 n.1Dundes, Fables of the Ancients?, 2003: p.16 #Friedrich Salomon Krauss (1859-1938), a specialist in Yugoslavian folklore, who had done fieldwork with guslars, believed these storytellers depended on \\"the fixed formulas from which he neither can nor wishes to vary\\".1908 paper, ‚ÄòVon wunderbaren Guslarengeldachtnis‚Äô, by Friedrich Krauss #Arnold van Gennep (1873-1957), suggested that \\"the poems of the guslars consist of a juxtaposition of cliches relatively few in number and with which it suffices merely to be conversant ‚Ä¶ A fine guslar is one who handles these cliches as we play with cards, who orders them differently according to the use he wishes to make of them\\".Arnold van Gennep. 1909.

Xanthias refers to several characters, notably all slaves,Xanthias who appear in plays by the Ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes. History In The Frogs, Xanthias is the slave of Dionysus. He delivers the opening line of the play, riding on Dionysus' donkey and debating with Dionysus about what jokes Xanthias can make. He and Dionysus trade barbs throughout the play, with Xanthias generally coming out on top. When they cross the Acheron, Xanthias is forced to carry the luggage around the lake because he was unable to participate in the Battle of Arginusae, allegedly due to pinkeye. In the underworld, Xanthias is forced by Dionysus to trade attire three times, to comedic effect‚Äîwhen Dionysus is dressed as Heracles, he is threatened by Aeacus, the hostess, and an ornery maid, while Xanthias as Heracles is welcomed joyfully by a nice maid. Xanthias also manages to trick Aeacus into whipping both him and Dionysus to avoid having monsters set upon him. Once the confusion about master and slave is sorted out, Xanthias flirts with the nice maid, discussing ways they secretly rebel against their masters. Importance Xanthias of The Frogs defies the convention of slaves introduced in earlier works by Aristophanes. In The Knights, The Wasps, and Peace, slaves fulfill two functions‚Äîthey introduce the situation at the beginning of the play and they provide comedic relief by being threatened or frightened.Dover, Kenneth, ed. Frogs. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997. Questia. 3 Dec. 2007 http://www.questiaschool.com/PM.qst?a=o&d;=91394614. However, in The Frogs, Xanthias begins by debating with his master about what kind of joke he can tell to initiate the play. Aristophanes uses their banter to blast the low level of humor used by contemporaries, referencing Phrynichus, Lykis, and Ameipsias. Aristophanes represents Xanthias as braver and cleverer than Dionysus. Xanthias pretends to see Empousa, frightening the bumbling, slouching Dionysus. Then Xanthias tricks Aeacus into whipping both of them to differentiate between master and servant. Xanthias is clearly dominant during the latter situation, as Dionysus pleads and whines to let Xanthias change clothes with him. Despite Xanthias' superiority, however, Dover cautions against an interpretation that Aristophanes supported emancipation‚Äîhe points out that Aristophanes' audience may quite possibly have seen little more in Xanthias' dominance than a confirmation of the impudence of the servant class, and the comedy of the situation can arise from a reversal of roles, similar to the comedy evoked in Aristophanes' Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae with respect to women. Brow-beating & topping a bumbling living god, Dionysus, during his multiple hallowed citations, may have had something to do with it, too. =Other appearances= *The Wasps, as Bdelycleon's slave *The Clouds, as Strepsiades' slave *The Birds, as a slave *The Acharnians, as a slave ordered to hold phallus upright  References  Fictional Greek and Roman slaves ","title":"Xanthias"},{"id":"14353694","text":"The Mediator is a series which contains six novels written by Meg Cabot.

It was signed in Krak√≥w by Polish nobility on 6 May 1499 and Vilnius by Lithuanian nobility on 24 July 1499. Casimir IV Jagiellon was both King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In his last will Casimir stipulated that the two states would be ruled by separately two of his sons. Thus after his death in 1492, John I Albert was elected to the Polish throne, while the Lithuanian Council of Lords chose Alexander Jagiellon. Thus the personal union between Poland and Lithuania was broken. The union at that time could be described as a dynastic union. In the late 1490s, Poland faced pressure from the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire, while Lithuania faced the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Ivan III of Russia claimed that he inherited rights to all Russian and Orthodox lands after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. His ambitions led to beginnings of the century- long Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian Wars. After the Tatars invaded Volhynia and Podolia in late 1494, John Albert suggested a military and further political alliance to his brother Alexander. He agreed, but negotiations dragged until spring 1498, when the Tatars invaded Podolia and Galicia and took thousands of prisoners. Reacting to these threats and wishing to secure Lithuanian military assistance, Polish nobles agreed with all Lithuanian suggestions and demands. The Union of Vilnius was based on the Union of Horod≈Ço of 1413. It was an alliance of two equal states. It was agreed that future rulers of both countries would be chosen separately, but with consent of the other state. The Union also provided for mutual aid and assistance in various armed conflicts. Historian Tomas Baranauskas interpreted it as the most advantageous for Lithuania of all Polish‚ÄìLithuanian unions. However, almost immediately Polish nobles began protesting the union on a technicality ‚Äì the act referenced the Union of Horod≈Ço, which they did not have available.
