He considered attending the University of Notre Dame, where his brother Jack had been a running back. Elder, who ran the 100-yard dash in 9.9 seconds, said that he chose Fordham to avoid comparisons to his brother. Elder ended up playing for the freshman team in 1941 and the varsity team in 1942. In October 1942, he sustained a broken foot in a game against West Virginia University. In the summer of 1943, Fordham shut down its football program. Elder went to Dartmouth College that fall as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program. When he arrived at Dartmouth, he was described as dealing with some chronic injuries, and he elected to play baseball instead of football. Elder later played baseball at UCLA. Baseball career In 1947 and 1948, Elder appeared with the Toledo Mud Hens, a minor league affiliate of the St. Louis Browns. In the spring of 1948, he was also named to the UCLA baseball coaching staff. He played for several other minor league teams before making his major league debut in July 1949.

The school occupied the block bounded by Ludstone, Favril and Passchendaele Streets. Established in 1935, the school was closed in 1988. Alumni are known as Old Hamptonians.  History  In 1924, the Education Department purchased land in Ludstone St Hampton from the War Homes Commission. The land had previously been a part of the Castlefield Estate, which later became Hailebury College. Following the purchase, a single story building designed by architect Percy Everett was built. The school campus also included a sporting oval on the western side of the property. While the sports field was utilised for various sporting activities, football and cricket were played on the Castlefield Reserve. In 1952, a two-storied Manual Arts Block in the modernist style (again designed by Percy Everett) was built to provide additional accommodation, as well as provide facilities for teaching art, craft, woodwork, metalwork and domestic science. In 1957, a fire destroyed the majority of the main building. A newly renovated building was opened in 1959, which was representative of the style of the original 1930s building. During this time, a new single-storied building was erected on the western side of the main building to support the growing number of matriculation students. This building became the prototype for many Victorian high schools that were built to support other schools throughout Victoria. In 1966, the main building was partly demolished to make way for new science laboratories, which were funded through a federal government grant.

The first suit, Montauk Tribe of Indians v. Long Island R.R. Co., brought by Wyandank Pharaoh in the name of the tribe, was dismissed because the tribe had not been explicitly authorized by the state to sue in its own name. As recommended by the Appellate Division's opinion, the second suit, Johnson v. Long Island R.R. Co., was brought in the name of Eugene M. Johnson, a citizen and tribal member. The New York Court of Appeals disavowed the previous dicta of the Appellate Division, and held that neither an individual Indian nor a tribe could sue in court without enabling legislation. The tribe failed in its efforts to convince the federal government to pass legislation enabling the tribe to bring the claim in federal court. In 1906, the state passed a statute enabling the tribe to sue, and Wyandank Pharaoh brought a third suit, Pharaoh v. Benson, in the name of the tribe. Reaching the merits, the New York courts held that the tribe no longer existed and that the transactions were valid. Since the litigation, the Montauks have failed in their efforts to obtain compensation from the federal and state government, and much of the land in question has come to be held by public parks.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/27/travel/history-at-the-tip-of-long- island.html?pagewanted=3 Background Map of the Long Island Rail Road, circa 1876 Circa 1875, the Montauk tribe began renting out Montauk Point for pasturage through the Proprietors' Company; the company took possession of the grazing allotments, and paid the tribe an annuity. Circa 1880, the shareholders of the company disagreed over whether the lands should continue to be leased, or whether they should be re-apportioned. In 1878, Robert M. Grinnell sued Edward M. Baker et al. for partition and division of the allotments.Pharaoh, 149 N.Y.S. at 440. In Grinnell v. Baker (unreported), the court ordered the lands sold at public auction (subject to the Montauk claim), with the proceeds distributed equally among the non-Indian lessees, rather than the Montauk tribe. The auction took place at the home of Jehial Parsons.John A. Strong & Philip Wyppensenwah-Rabito, More on How Montauk Was Parceled Out, New York Times letter to the editor, at LI11. Arthur W. Benson bought the at auction for $151,000 in 1879. In turn, Benson sold of the land to the Long Island Rail Road for $600,000. Benson hired Nathaniel Dominey to negotiate the removal of the Montauks still living on the reservation. At a later, Senate Sub-Committee hearing, Dominey testified that eight Indians remained on the reservation at the time, including: future Chief Wyandank Pharaoh (10 years old at the time), his mother, and two of her brothers. Later, Dominey experienced a change of heart and cooperated with the Montauks in their claim, and turning over his letters from Benson. Dominey testified that he compensated Wyandank Pharaoh's mother with a $100 semi-annual annuity and two houses, to be inherited by Pharaoh, $80 each to her two brothers, and $10 to Wyandank. Arthur Benson had viewed Montauk as \\"his private playground\\"; after his death, his son approached Austin Corbin, President and controlling shareholder of the Long Island Rail Road, and Charles Pratt, of Standard Oil, about the possibility of voiding his fathers will and opening Montauk to development. Montauk Point was purchased by Corbin and Pratt in 1895. On October 30, 1895, Chief Wyandank Pharaoh returned from a research trip to Brooklyn and Washington, D.C. to gather evidence to pursue a claim.Montauks to Make a Test Case, New York Times, Oct. 30, 1895, at 1. Pharaoh declared his intentions to undertake a hunting trip on the disputed land and initiate a lawsuit if he was interfered with. The New York Times blamed Chief Pharaoh for the dispute: > If King Wyandank Pharaoh of the Montauk Tribe of Indians had not given for > $10 the living members of the Montauk tribe might now be wealthy, instead of > being poor and fighting for their rights with a desperate hope of regaining > at least part of what they claim to be their lawful heritage.Indians Claim > Lands, New York Times, Sept. 23, 1900, at 15. Montauk Tribe of Indians v. Long Island R.R. Co. (App. Div. 1898) =Supreme Court= Judge Edgar M. Cullen delivered the opinion of the Appellate Division. Chief Wyandank Pharaoh, on behalf of the tribe, filed suit, stating a cause of action for ejectment on February 5, 1897.Strong, 2001, at 120. For proof of tribal status, the tribe cited a partition action decided by Judge Dykman and the 1890 United States Census. The complaint valued the land at approximately $300,000. On June 5, 1897, Judge Wilmot Moses Smith of the New York Supreme Court set a hearing date for June 19 in Patchogue to hear the oral arguments for the defendants' demurrer.Indians' Claim for Montauk Point, New York Times, June 5, 1897, at 21. The matter was transferred to Judge Samuel T. Maddox in Brooklyn. Judge Maddox granted the demurrer, dismissing the action but allowing the tribe to re-plead if they paid costs. =Appellate Division= The Montauk's, represented by ex-judge George M. Curtis, filed a notice of appeal on December 22, 1897.Indians Want the Land, New York Times, Dec. 22, 1897, at 1. Before the Appellate Division, the Montauk's case was argued by Leman B. Treadwell, with Francis M. Morrison (both Boston lawyers) also on the brief.Montauk Tribe of Indians v. Long Island R.R. Co., 51 N.Y.S. 142 (App. Div. 1898). Alfred A. Gardner argued on behalf of the LIRR, with William J. Kelly on the brief. The Appellate Division panel consisted of Judges Goodrich, Edgar M. Cullen, Willard Bartlett, Hatch, and Woodward. The Appellate Division of the Second Department unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Suffolk Special Term on April 19, 1898.Legal Notes: Rights of Indian Tribes, New York Times, Apr. 29, 1900, at 16. Citing Strong v. Waterman and Seneca Nation of Indians v. Christy, Judge Cullen noted that \\"no provision had been made by law for bringing ejectment to recover possession of [Indians]\\" and \\"as a body or tribe, the Indians have no corporate name by which they can institute such a suit.\\" Judge Cullen suggested that the tribe either petition the legislature for enabling legislation to allow them to sue as a tribe, or have individual members bring the suit. Johnson v. Long Island R.R. Co. (N.Y. 1900) Judge Edward T. Bartlett held that neither an individual Indian nor a tribe could sue, unless authorized by state statute. =Supreme Court= Eugene M. Johnson, a U.S. citizen of Montauk descent, and a member of the tribe since birth, brought a similar suit in his own name, on behalf of himself and other similarly interested. The Special Term sustained a demurrer. =Appellate Division= The divided panel of the Appellate Division of the Second Department reversed on July 1, 1899.Johnson v. Long Island R.R. Co., 61 N.Y.S. 1139 (App. Div. 1899) (per curiam), rev'd, 56 N.E. 992 (N.Y. 1900). In a per curiam opinion, joined by all but Judge Willard Bartlett, the Appellate Division held: > While the right to maintain this action in its present form is not free from > doubt, still, as it is brought in accordance with the view expressed by us > on the prior appeal, we think we should adhere to our former decision, and > allow the question to be finally determined by the court of appeals.Johnson, > 61 N.Y.S. at 1139 (citation omitted). =Court of Appeals= The Appellate Division certified three questions to the Court of Appeals: > 1. Has the plaintiff in this action legal capacity to sue? > 2. Is there a defect of the parties plaintiff in this action, in that the > members of the alleged Montauk Tribe of Indians are not made parties > plaintiff? > 3. Does the complaint herein state facts sufficient to constitute a cause > of action?Johnson, 56 N.E. at 992. Before the Court of Appeals, Treadwell and Morrison again argued for the Montauks, while Gardner and Kelly again argued for the LIRR. The New York Court of Appeals reversed the Appellate Division, and affirmed the Special Term, on April 17, 1900. The court answered all three certified questions in the negative, without costs to either party.Johnson, 56 N.E. at 468. Judge Edward T. Bartlett, joined by Judges Denis O'Brien, Albert Haight, and Celora E. Martin, held that Johnson had no capacity to bring a suit on the tribe's behalf. The Court held that Indians, as wards of the state, had no right to sue unless conferred by statute: > A decision holding that this action could be maintained either by the tribe, > or an individual member thereof on behalf of himself and all others who > should come in and contribute, would be contrary to the policy and practice > which have been long established in our treatment of the Indian tribes. They > are regarded as the wards of the state, and, generally speaking, possessed > of only such rights to appear and litigate in courts of justice as are > conferred upon them by statute.Johnson, 56 N.E. at 467-68. Chief Judge Alton B. Parker concurred in the result, without separate opinion; Judges Irving G. Vann and Landon dissented, without opinion. Senate Indian Affairs Sub-Committee hearing (1900) The Fifth Avenue Hotel, the site of the Sub-Committee hearing Chief Pharaoh, along with representatives of the Shinnecock Tribe, Narragansett Tribe, and Mohegan Tribe, testified before a Sub-Committee of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on September 22, 1900, at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. The Sub-Committee consisted of Senators John M. Thurston (R-NE) and Orville H. Platt (R-CT). In addition to Pharaoh, the testifying Indians were: Rev. Eugene A. Johnson, Nathan J. Cuffee, and James Cuffee (of the Montauk Council), John Noka, Joshua Noka, and Donald Seeter (of the Narragansett Council), David Kellis (of the Shinnecock Council). Maria Crippen and Dr. William H. Johnson of the Montauk tribe were among the spectators. Rev. Johnson testified that there were 300 living members of the Montauk tribe. Johnson also testified that the New York state legislature had denied the Montauks a hearing because they were not \\"persons.\\" Johnson argued that the Montauks could not alienate property without the consent of both New York and the federal government. He valued the disputed property at $3,000,000. The tribes requested special legislation to allow them to bring their land claims, for fraud, in the United States circuit court. The Montauks and Shinnecocks claimed of Montauk Point; the Narragansetts an eight-square- mile tract near Narragansett Bay; the Mohegans a reservation in and near Norwich, Connecticut. Tredwell and Morrison continued to represent the tribes before the hearing. State enabling legislation (1906) A bill granting the Montauks permission to sue was introduced in February 1903.Strong, 2001, at 125. The Montauk's lawyer, Charles O. Maas, was the key lobbyist for the bill. On April 10, 1906, the New York legislature passed a statute enabling the Montauk tribe to bring suit,1906 N.Y. Laws, ch. 177. The act contained the following proviso: \\"the question as to the existence of the Montauk Tribe of Indians shall be a question of law and fact to be determined by the court.\\"Strong, 2001, at 127. Judge Blackmar interpreted the act as \\"providing that the act should not be construed as conferring tribal rights on any individuals, but that the question of the existence of the Montauk Tribe should be determined by the court.\\"Pharaoh, 127 N.Y.S. at 1038. Pharaoh v. Benson (N.Y. 1918) Montauk LIRR station house =Supreme Court= Pursuant to the enabling act, Chief Wyandank Pharaoh brought a third suit on behalf of the tribe in 1906. The named defendants were: Jane Ann Benson and Mary Benson, the executrices of Arthur Benson's will, John J. Pierrepoint and Henry R. Hoyt, the executors and trustees of Frank Sherman Benson's will, Mary Benson, the Montauk Company, the Montauk Dock and Improvement Company, Alfred W. Hoyt, the Montauk Extension Railroad Company, and the Long Island Rail Road. An area of was named in the third complaint ( of it adjacent to the LIRR). Chief Pharaoh was represented by Maas and Lawrence W. Trowbridge (of counsel). The defendants were represented by Daly, Hoyt & Mason (for the Bensons), Austin & McLanahan (for the Dock and Improvement Co.), A. T. Mason (for Pierrepoint and Henry Hoyt), P. Tecumseh Sherman (for Alfred Hoyt), and Joseph Keany (for the LIRR). According to a 1910 Q&A; in the New York Times, the lawyers fees were \\"long since supposed to have eclipsed the value of the land in litigation.\\"Queries and Answers, New York Times, Nov. 6, 1910, at X11. The trial took place, without a jury, before Judge Abel Blackmar of the Supreme Court of Suffolk County, Special Term.Strong, 2001, at 128. Fourteen of the sixteen living Montauk men appeared as witnesses at trial. Judge Blackmar, ruled against the Montauks on October 11, 1910.Indians Can't Get Lands, New York Times, Oct. 12, 1910, at 6. According to Blackmar, the Montauks individually conveyed all their lands and claims to Arthur Benson between 1885 and 1894, in exchange for $100 to $250 each, except for Wyandank Pharaoh who received only $10, plus between in Freetown and East Hampton, plus a $240 annuity to be divided per capita. Judge Blackmar also relied upon a December 1686 patent granted by Governor Thomas Dongan to the freeholders of East Hampton, granting them the exclusive right to purchase Indian lands in the area. Benson had separately purchased the fee rights from the descendants of the patentees. Judge Blackmar also held that the Montauks were no longer a tribe: > During this long period the number of the Indians was greatly reduced. Their > blood became so mixed that in many of them Indian traits were obliterated. > They had no internal government, and they lived a sort of shiftless life, > hunting, fishing, cultivating the ground 'Indian fashion' as a witness > called it, and often leaving for long periods and working in some menial > capacity for the whites.Pharaoh, 126 N.Y.S. at 1037-38. Indian Fields Montauk Big Reed Nature Trail =Appellate Division= On appeal, the Montauks found a new lawyer: Allen Caruthers.Strong, 2001, at 141. The Appellate Division--composed of Judges Jenks, Burr, Rich, Stapleton, and Putnam--affirmed on October 16, 1914. On appeal, the Montauks were represented by Allen Caruthers, while the defendants were represented by Charles K. Carpenter, with Alexander T. Mason and George T. Austin on the brief. Judge Burr, for a unanimous court, wrote the opinion. =Court of Appeals= The Court of Appeals--composed of Chief Judge Frank Harris Hiscock and Judges Emory A. Chase, Frederick Collin, William Herman Cuddeback, John W. Hogan, McLaughlin, and Frederick E. Crane--affirmed (per curiam, without opinion) on January 29, 1918, without costs.Pharaoh v. Benson, 126 N.Y.S. 1035 (Sup. Ct. 1910), aff'd, 149 N.Y.S. 438 (App. Div. 1914), aff'd, 119 N.E. 1072 (N.Y. 1918) (per curiam). Aftermath Montauk Point State Park Hither Hills State Park =Federal lobbying= Maas departed for Washington, D.C. after the passage of the state enabling legislation. The Interior Department endorsed the idea on July 7, 1906. In January 1921, Senator James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr. (R-NY) and Representative Homer P. Snyder (R-NY) introduced legislation and asked the Interior Secretary to report to Congress on the Montauk's tribal status and the merits of their land claim.Strong, 2001, at 147-48. The Secretary prepared a report agreeing with the conclusions of Judge Blackmar and the New York appellate courts in Pharaoh v. Benson.Strong, 2001, at 150-52. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs received the report on April 22, 1922, and introduced the Wadsworth bill that June; the bill did not make it out of committee.Strong, 2001, at 152. In 1996, represented by Bell, Boyd & Lloyd, the Montauks filed a letter of intent with the Branch of Acknowledgement and Research of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the first step towards federal recognition.Strong, 2001, at 167. The petition for recognition was submitted on June 23, 1998.Strong, 2001, at 174. The tribe received a request for documents from the BIA in January 1999.Strong, 2001, at 174-75. =State lobbying= On February 14, 1922, New York state assemblyman John J. O'Connor introduced legislation to compensate the Montauks.Strong, 2001, at 149-50. The bill excluded James Waters and the other members of the Montauk diaspora.Strong, 2001, at 150. The bill would have created a three-person committee--composed of two assembly members and one state senator--to determine whether the land claim had been meritorious. The bill never reached the floor. =Montaukett burial grounds= In 1983, Fort Hill Associates and Signal Hill Associates applied to the town of East Hampton for a permit to build homes on North Neck hill, above the Montauk's ancestral burial ground.Strong, 2001, at 160. As quoted in the New York Times, the East Hampton town supervisor said, \\"Who cares about a bunch of dead Indians?\\" The Montauketts won a temporary injunction in court that July. That November, the town board voted to purchase the for $1.4 million and preserve the burial ground. In 1989, developers announced plans touching on a different Montaukett burial ground in North Neck. After protests, the town government agreed to preserve the site in 1991.Strong, 2001, at 163. =State parks= In 1984, the federal government announced plans to sell Montauk Air Force Station, a air force installation south of Montauk Point, to real estate developers.Strong, 2001, at 162. New York State and the Town of East Hampton sued to block the sale. The land was eventually turned over to the New York State Park Service, becoming Camp Hero State Park. The state purchased of Hither Woods in 1986 and created Hither Hills State Park. In 1988, the state purchased more to augment the park. Notes References *John A.

Seismicity refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The Sumatran coast is in the subduction zone where the Indian plate meets the Burma plate beneath the Andaman Sea, forming the northern part of the Sunda trench. The shallow seismicity is characteristically distributed across a wide area of plate movement.Barber, A. J. (2005). The Sunda trench is also closely related to the Sumatran Fault, a transform fault running the entire length of the island.

It is a biopic of the Catalan poet Jaime Gil de Biedma, based on a biography written by Miguel Dalmau. Plot In 1959, Jaime Gil de Biedma, a wealthy poet from Barcelona, is visiting Manila on business trip as director of the Philippine Tobacco Company. At night, the poet gives free rein to his homosexuality. He meets Johnny, a young man who works in an erotic nightclub, and they have sex. The poverty of Manila makes a deep impression on Jaime and heightens his social conscience. Back in Barcelona, the Spanish police interrogate Jaime about some of his subversive friends who are still dreaming of regime change in Spain. Jaime is refused membership in the Communist Party because he is gay. He visits his friend and editor Carlos Barral, and meets Juan Marsé, a young writer about to publish his first novel. Jaime is trying to save his relationship with Luis, his lover, but although in love with him, Jaime treats Luis, who is of humble background, with contempt. After a heated argument Luis leaves him for good. Describing himself as \\"a Sunday poet with a Monday conscience\\", Jaime mixes his weekly working days for his family's company with a bohemian lifestyle on weekends. Don Luis, Jaime's father, takes care of Jaime's troubles with the police, but he warns his son he has to sort his life out because he is putting his family and the business in jeopardy. By the mid 1960s, Jaime favorite spot is the Bocaccio nightclub where he meets the sexy and enigmatic Bel, a divorced woman with two kids. They quickly establish a relationship. Bel is entangled in a bitter battle with her ex-husband for the custody of her children. Jaime buys an apartment and asks Bel to marry him, but she turns him down. They are two free spirits, getting married would condemn their relationship to failure. Overwhelmed by the events, Jaime loses himself in the night and gets drunk. That same night, Bel dies in a tragic accident. When he hears the news, Jaime, in despair, tries to take his own life. He manages to get back on his feet with the support of friends and family. However, Jaime will never write poetry again. At the beginning of the 1970s, Jaime goes to the Philippines and has to deal with the economic changes which the company is going through under Ferdinand Marcos's dictatorship. On his return, Jaime meets Toni, a young assistant of photography of humble background, and they begin a sentimental relationship. In spite of his class awareness, he seems to be attracted to men of lower background. Toni, for his part, insists on learning all he can from Jaime and asks him to introduce him into his sophisticated world. One day, at the beach with Tony and some friends, Jaime is move to tears watching the freshness of a girl dancing with Tony. As a middle-aged poet, Jaime is painfully aware of the passage of time, his misspent youth, and the death that patiently awaits him. He writes in a poem: \\"What do you want now, youth, you impudent delight of life?,\\" \\"What brings you to the beach? We old ones were content until you came along to wound us by reviving the most fearful of impossible dreams. You come to rummage through our imaginations.\\" Jaime's father dies and events pile up. The growing tension between Jaime and Toni leads to a violent confrontation in the country house which Jaime has bought as their love nest. Toni throws him out, and Jaime trips and is injured in the snow. He almost dies. \\"The fact that life was to be taken seriously we understand only later\\", he narrates in another poem, \\"Like all young people, I was going to change the world. I wanted to make my mark and withdraw to applause. Growing old, dying, it was all a question of the size of the theater. But time has passed and I see the unpleasant truth. Growing old, dying, is the play's only plot.\\" Years later, old and tired, Jaime lives out his days with a young stage actor. He finds out that he has AIDS. The passing of time and illness have left their mark on him. His friends, who know that Jaime is dying, organize a poetry recital at Madrid's famous Students Residence, which turns into a public acclamation of the poet. Although old and approaching death, he still yearns for youth and beauty. He hires a young male prostitute, but in a hotel room he can only passively observe the young naked man dancing to The Pet Shop Boys' song Always on My Mind.

The Nelson firm of H Baigent and Sons Ltd was formed by him. His funeral was noted as one of the largest that had ever taken place in Nelson.  Family  Henry Baigent was the son of Edward and Mary Ann Baigent (née Hern). His parents had come out to Nelson from Windlesham, Surrey, England in 1842 on the Clifford. His brother Joseph was born three days after his parents' arrival in the colony and Joseph was only the seventh child to be born in Nelson. His father was a member of the Provincial Council throughout its existence, and afterwards in the House of Representatives. Baigent was married twice, firstly to Margaret Inglis Wallace in 1866, who died in 1880. He then married Phoebe Atmore in 1885, an older sister of Harry Atmore, who would later represent the Nelson electorate in Parliament for several decades. Phoebe had previously been married to William Wilkie. She died in March 1920 after a long period of illness.Obituary, Colonist, Volume LXII, Issue 15328, 17 March 1920, Page 1 Baigent had at least eight children; Albert Henry Baigent and Edward Sydney James Baigent by his first wife Margaret and the remaining six by his second wife Phoebe. Baigent's eldest son Albert died suddenly in October 1905 of an illness. His son John was part of the 29th Reinforcements Canterbury Infantry Regiment, C Company. He embarked for Glasgow on 15 August 1917 the New Zealand Shipping Company liner the SS Ruahine and then to France. He was killed in action on the Somme while part of the Canterbury Infantry Regiment, 2nd Battalion on 29 March 1918.Commonwealth War Graves CommissionNominal Rolls of New Zealand Expeditionary Force Volume III. Wellington: Govt. Printer, 1918 His son Cyril from his second marriage died in 1923 as a result of war disabilities.  Origins of his timber business His father brought a small gristmill and also a saw-milling plant with him. In February 1843 he settled in Wakefield where he set up the gristmill, a small affair two feet in diameter driven by a water wheel. Then in 1845 he erected his sawmill.Nelson Corporation - Mayor, pages 37-28, The Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Nelson, Marlborough & Westland Provincial Districts], The Cyclopedia Company, Limited, 1906, Christchurch Owing to a meagre supply of iron his father was compelled to use such hard woods as manuka, akiaki, or black mairi for cog wheels. From this small a beginning did Baigent's timber merchants grow. A flour mill was worked in conjunction with the timber mill, complete machinery and proper stones in the meantime having been obtained. The same water power was used as for the sawmill, the latter working by day, and the flour mill by night, and eventually the flour mill was handed over to the charge of a brother of Henry Baigent, who worked it for some years later. In the 1860s his father installed a steam powered mill on another site. Baigent was entrusted with the task of opening a branch in Nelson in the 1870s. He established a manufacturing plant and in 1882 his father gave him the Nelson business. The principal timber milled was white, red, and black pine, totara, rimu, and birch. The factory produced sashes, doors, blinds, and building timber for the Nelson district and employed, on an average, between forty and fifty men.  Local politics  In 1893 he was elected by a substantial majority to a seat in the Council having defeated, among others, John Graham who went on to represent Nelson in Parliament. Baigent remained a councillor until he became Mayor in 1901. He lost the 1904 election to Jesse Piper but regained it in April 1905. The voting was Baigent 728 and Piper 563. He did not stand in 1906 and Jesse Piper succeeded him.  Community organisations  Mr Baigent represented Golden Bay on the Charitable Aid Board. He has had an extended connection with the Masonic and Oddfellows Societies. He was President of the Nelson Cricket Association and the Wakatu Hockey Club; and Vice-President of the Waimea Agricultural and Pastoral Association as well as a number of other clubs and societies. Death Baigent died on Saturday, 31 August 1929, aged 84 years. His funeral was noted as one of the largest that had ever taken place in Nelson. Among the pall bearers was Harry Atmore, a noted local politician and his brother in law.

U.S. Navy humanitarian flight undergoes radioactive decontamination The international reaction to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has been diverse and widespread. Many inter- governmental agencies responded to the Japanese Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, often on an ad hoc basis. Responders included International Atomic Energy Agency, World Meteorological Organization and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which has radiation detection equipment deployed around the world. In September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster \\"caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power\\". Many countries have advised their nationals to leave Tokyo, citing the risk associated with the nuclear plants' ongoing accident. Nonetheless, estimates of radioactivity leakage into the Pacific Ocean remain modest with National Geographic reporting the leakage of approximately 0.3 Tbq per month of both 137Cs and 134Cs. 0.3 TBq is equal to 1/40th of the natural radiation in one km3 of seawater and 1/50000000000th of the total natural radioactivity in the oceans. Following the Fukushima I accidents, The Economist reported that the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035. Germany accelerated plans to close all of its old nuclear power reactors and to phase the rest out entirely by 2022. The policy is controversial leading to electricity twice the price of that in neighbouring France. Der Spiegel reported that German Economy and Energy Minister Sigmar Gabriel admitted that \\"exiting nuclear and coal-fired power generation at the same time would not be possible\\". In Italy there was a national referendum, in which 94 percent voted against the governments plan to build new nuclear power plants. Elsewhere in the world, nuclear power continues to be discussed in Malaysia, and plans are well-advanced in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Bangladesh. China briefly paused its nuclear development program, but has since restarted it. China plans to triple its nuclear capacity to at least 58 GWe by 2020, then some 150 GWe by 2030, and much more by 2050. Nuclear industry According to Areva's Southeast Asia and Oceania director, Selena Ng, Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster is \\"a huge wake-up call for a nuclear industry that hasn't always been sufficiently transparent about safety issues\\". She said \\"There was a sort of complacency before Fukushima and I don't think we can afford to have that complacency now\\". In September 2011, German engineering giant Siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world. The company's chairman, Peter Löscher, said that \\"Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company, in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades\\". Siemens is to boost its work in the renewable energy sector. Regulatory agencies Many inter-governmental agencies are responding, often on an ad hoc basis. Responders include International Atomic Energy Agency, World Meteorological Organization and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which has radiation detection equipment deployed around the world. Some scientists say that the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents have revealed that the nuclear industry lacks sufficient oversight, leading to renewed calls to redefine the mandate of the IAEA so that it can better police nuclear power plants worldwide. There are several problems with the IAEA says Najmedin Meshkati of University of Southern California: > It recommends safety standards, but member states are not required to > comply; it promotes nuclear energy, but it also monitors nuclear use; it is > the sole global organization overseeing the nuclear energy industry, yet it > is also weighed down by checking compliance with the Nuclear Non- > Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The journal Nature has reported that the IAEA response to the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan was \\"sluggish and sometimes confusing\\", drawing calls for the agency to \\"take a more proactive role in nuclear safety\\". But nuclear experts say that the agency's complicated mandate and the constraints imposed by its member states mean that reforms will not happen quickly or easily, although its INES \\"emergency scale is very likely to be revisited\\" given the confusing way in which it was used in Japan. Russian nuclear opponent Iouli Andreev was critical of the response to Fukushima, and says that the IAEA did not learn from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. He has accused the IAEA and corporations of \\"wilfully ignoring lessons from the world's worst nuclear accident 25 years ago to protect the industry's expansion\\". The IAEA's role \\"as an advocate for nuclear power has made it a target for protests\\". One of the IAEA statutory functions is to establish safety standards to protect the health, life and property in the use of nuclear power. When reports of the damaged nuclear power plants at Fukushima emerged, many countries looked immediately to the IAEA for more information. But its initial reports provided scant and at times contradictory information from Japanese sources and it took a week for the IAEA to dispatch a team to Japan to gather more facts on the ground. While the IAEA has stated that it was hampered by lack of official information from Japan, this \\"has nonetheless prompted analysts to question the efficacy of the Agency\\". Olli Heinonen has said that \\"Fukushima should be a wake-up call to re-evaluate and strengthen the role of the IAEA in boosting nuclear safety, including its response mechanism\\". On 28 March 2011, at a special briefing on the Fukshima nuclear accidents held for IAEA Member States, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano announced that a high-level IAEA Conference on Nuclear Safety should take place in Vienna. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Japan \\"underestimated the danger of tsunamis and failed to prepare adequate backup systems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant\\". This repeated a widely held criticism in Japan that \\"collusive ties between regulators and industry led to weak oversight and a failure to ensure adequate safety levels at the plant\\". The IAEA also said that the Fukushima disaster exposed the lack of adequate backup systems at the plant. Once power was completely lost, critical functions like the cooling system shut down. Three of the reactors \\"quickly overheated, causing meltdowns that eventually led to explosions, which hurled large amounts of radioactive material into the air\\". On 30 March, Denis Flory, IAEA deputy director general and head of the agency's nuclear safety and security department, said readings from soil samples collected in Iitate indicate that one of the IAEA operational criteria for evacuation is exceeded there. On 31 March, In response to the IAEA, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Thursday the government may implement measures, if necessary, such as urging people living in the area to evacuate, if it is found that the contaminated soil will have a long-term effect on human health. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told a press conference in the afternoon that the agency's rough estimates have shown there is no need for people in Iitate to evacuate immediately under criteria set by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan.http://e.nikkei.com/e/fr/tnks/Nni20110331D3ZJF606.htm The Japanese government declined recommendation of IAEA. In April 2011, representatives from dozens of countries met in Austria to scrutinize safety at each other's power plants with the aim of avoiding accidents such as the Japanese nuclear crisis. The meeting was hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency and focused on the Convention on Nuclear Safety that came into being in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident and Chernobyl disaster. On 12 April 2011, the IAEA reported that the nuclear accident at Fukushima I is now rated as a Level 7 \\"major accident\\" on the INES scale. Level 7 is the most serious level on INES and is used to describe an event consisting of \\"a major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures.\\" Over the previous month, some scientists in the United States and the head of France's Nuclear Safety Authority argued that the accident was, at that time, already worse than the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, which was rated a 5. Following the Fukushima I accidents, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035. In September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster \\"caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power\\". Non-government organizations Linda Gunter of Beyond Nuclear spoke to the World Socialist Web Site on 19 March 2011. Gunter stated that the disaster could not be called an accident because it was the outcome of a \\"gamble [that] has been going on since the dawn of the nuclear age\\". She also voiced concern over Fukushima-style reactors operating in the United States. Beyond Nuclear began a campaign to shut these reactors down on 13 April 2011. The World Future Council issued a \\"Statement on the Japanese Nuclear Disaster\\" on 29 March 2011, supported by many Right Livelihood Award Laureates. It said that the disaster in Japan has demonstrated the limits of human capability to keep dangerous technologies free from accidents with catastrophic results: > The conclusion we draw from the nuclear power plant accident in Japan is > that the human community, acting for itself and as trustees for future > generations, must exercise a far higher level of care globally in dealing > with technologies capable of causing mass annihilation, and should phase > out, abolish and replace such technologies with alternatives that do not > threaten present and future generations. This applies to nuclear weapons as > well as to nuclear power reactors. Citing the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, environmental activists at a U.N. meeting in April 2011 \\"urged bolder steps to tap renewable energy so the world doesn't have to choose between the dangers of nuclear power and the ravages of climate change\\". Some shipping lines restricted their ships from calling on the Tokyo Bay ports of Tokyo and Yokohama over radiation concerns. Vessels risk facing extra delays for checks at subsequent destinations if they pick up even trace contamination. =Greenpeace= Greenpeace sent radiology experts to the villages of Iitate and Tsushima in the Fukushima Prefecture. They found levels up to 100 μSv/h in the village of Iitate, and based on that, recommended that the government widen the 20 km no-go zone, which Iitate lies outside of, to at least 30 km. An official of the NSA said that high radioactivity levels detected by the NGO could not be considered reliable, although some members of Greenpeace stressed that their numbers corresponded in other areas. The New York Times called the reporting by Greenpeace (with a well-known anti-nuclear position) a \\"guarded endorsement to the radiation data published by the Japanese government\\", due to the general correspondence between the numbers. Members of Greenpeace stressed that there has been distrust of the official data, and that their contention was not the radiation levels, but the action that was taken. Financial markets As a result of the accidents, stock prices of many energy companies reliant on nuclear sources and listed on stock exchanges have dropped, while renewable energy companies have increased dramatically in value. In Germany, demand for renewable energy has increased among private consumers. Funds that invested in companies tied to renewable energy, clean technology, the oil industry and other natural resources rose 13.7% in the first three months of 2011, \\"benefiting from turmoil in the oil-rich Middle East and the anti-nuclear sentiment after the accident in Japan\\". Actions and recommendations related to the Fukushima disaster =Evacuation from Tokyo and Japan= On 14 March, France became the first country to advise its nationals to leave Tokyo, citing a probable large aftershock in the Kanto area and the risk associated with the nuclear plants' ongoing accidents. Embassies of other countries, including UK, Germany,German embassy in Japan moved to Osaka amid nuclear fears. Xinhua News Agency. Retrieved 19 March 2011. Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Kenya, Israel repeated similar advice in the following days. German, Austrian, Finnish and Bulgarian embassies were temporarily relocated in southern parts of Japan. Russian authorities were reported on 15 March to be ready to evacuate the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin, if needed. On 12 April, the Philippines government announced that they would pay for the repatriation of any Filipinos living in the evacuation zone. On 16 March, Voice of America reported that the US Embassy in Tokyo had advised Americans to evacuate to at least 80 km from the plant, or to stay indoors. US officials have concluded that the Japanese warnings have been insufficient, and that, deliberately or not, they have understated the potential threat of what is taking place inside the nuclear facility, according to The New York Times. Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), earlier said he believed that all the water in the spent fuel pool at Unit 4 had boiled dry, leaving fuel rods stored there exposed. \\"We believe that radiation levels are extremely high, which could possibly impact the ability to take corrective measures,\\" he told a Congressional committee. United States government officials moved to allay fears of nuclear fallout, stating that people do not need to take or stockpile potassium iodide pills, after a spike in calls from the West Coast to health hotlines, and runs at pharmacies with people buying the iodine tablets on the Pacific Coast. = Potassium Iodide = A number of embassies in Tokyo, including Australia, France, Sweden,http://www.swedenabroad.com/News____4211.aspx?slaveid=123145 Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States issued potassium iodide tablets as a precautionary measure to their citizens and immediate family members. On 20 March, Swedish citizens in Tokyo were recommended to begin taking potassium iodide as a precautionary measure. This recommendation was lifted on 29 March. Due to a run on potassium iodide tablets in pharmacies in Western Canada, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, issued statements on 15 March of reassurance that Canada was not at risk from the fallout, and that taking the iodine tablets was unnecessary. British Columbia's health officer Dr. Perry Kendall, urged residents not to stockpile the tablets. On 17 March, the United States newsmagazine Time reported on the Southern Californian residents reaction to the risk from the fallout, and the run on iodine tablets. On 18 March, France was reported to be shipping iodide tablets to French Polynesia as a preventative measure, in light of the fallout cloud drifting across the Pacific. =Requests and offers for help= The Japanese government and Tokyo Electric asked France's Areva to provide technical assistance in the process of removing radioactive water from the nuclear power facility. On 16 March, Korea was reported to be sending boron for the production of boric acid to dampen fission reactions. A Ukrainian group of specialists who were involved in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster proposed liquid metal cooling with a low-melting and chemically neutral metal, such as tin, to cool the fuel rods even if they are molten or damaged. A team of Ukrainian nuclear specialists was reported on 17 March to be ready to fly out to realize this. The United States launched Operation Tomodachi to assist the Japanese in their recovery. Readings from aerial survey conducted by United States federal agencies after the Fukushima accident Three days after the earthquake, the U.S. Department of Energy in cooperation with the NNSA sent 33 people and 8.6 tons of equipment to Japan to assist efforts to monitor radiation, including consequence management response teams and a NNSA aerial system that took thousands of radiation readings over the next two weeks. =Cleanup= International experts have said that a workforce in the hundreds or even thousands would take years or decades to clean up the area. John Price, a former member of the Safety Policy Unit at the UK's National Nuclear Corporation, has said that it \\"might be 100 years before melting fuel rods can be safely removed from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant\\". Edward Morse, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, has said: > ...there would be at least six months of emergency stabilisation, about two > years of temporary remediation and up to 30 years of full-scale clean-up. > Furthermore, the high levels of ground contamination at the site are raising > concerns about the viability of individuals to work at the site in coming > decades. =Other reactions= The Hong Kong Government issued a black outbound travel alert for Fukushima prefecture on 12 March urging to avoid all travel. The alert came in addition to the red outbound travel alert for the rest of Japan. On 19 March 2011, Indonesia began screening passengers and luggage on direct flights from Japan for radiation. No radiation has been detected. On 16 March, Swedish citizens were advised to avoid staying within 80 km of the Fukushima nuclear power plants, and all travel to Japan was advised against. On 29 March the travel advice eased to only apply to non-necessary travel. The South Korea Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute operates 59 radiation monitoring centers across the nation of South Korea. After the Fukushima disaster begun, radiation monitoring activities increased across the country but radiation levels remained normal. Protests and politics by country =Taiwan= In March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate halt to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant. The protesters were also opposed to plans to extend the lifespan of three existing nuclear plants. Amid Japan's ongoing nuclear crisis, nuclear energy is emerging as a contentious issue for next year's presidential election in Taiwan, as opposition leader Tsai Ing-wen declared her intention to abandon nuclear power by 2025 if elected. Taiwan is on the West Pacific Rim earthquake zone, like Japan. George Hsu, a professor of applied economics at National Chung Hsing University in central Taiwan, said nuclear power plants in quake- prone areas need to be redesigned to make them more resistant, an investment that would reduce their original cost advantage. In May 2011, 5,000 people joined an anti-nuclear protest in Taipei City, which was characterized by a carnival-like atmosphere, with protesters holding yellow banners and clutching sunflowers. This was part of a nationwide \\"No Nuke Action\\" protest, urging the government to stop construction of a Fourth Nuclear Plant and pursue a more sustainable energy policy. On the eve of World Environment Day in June 2011, environmental groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 environmental groups and legislators, gathered in Taipei with banners that read: \\"I love Taiwan, not nuclear disasters\\". They protested against the nation's three operating nuclear power plants and the construction of a fourth plant. They also called for \\"all nuclear power plants to be thoroughly re-evaluated and shut down immediately if they fail to pass safety inspections\\". According to Wang To- far, economics professor at National Taipei University, \\"if a level-seven nuclear crisis were to happen in Taiwan, it would destroy the nation\\". =United States= What had been growing acceptance of nuclear power in the United States was eroded sharply following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, with public support for building nuclear power plants in the U.S. dropping slightly lower than it was immediately after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, according to a CBS News poll. Only 43 percent of those polled after the Fukushima nuclear emergency said they would approve building new power plants in the United States. Activists who were involved in the U.S. anti-nuclear movement's emergence (such as Graham Nash and Paul Gunter), suggest that Japan's nuclear crisis may rekindle an interest in the movement in the United States. The aim, they say, is \\"not just to block the Obama administration's push for new nuclear construction, but to convince Americans that existing plants pose dangers\\". In March 2011, 600 people gathered for a weekend protest outside the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant. The demonstration was held to show support for the thousands of Japanese people who are endangered by possible radiation from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The New England region has a long history of anti-nuclear activism and 75 people held a State House rally on 6 April 2011, to \\"protest the region's aging nuclear plants and the increasing stockpile of radioactive spent fuel rods at them\\". The protest was held shortly before a State House hearing where legislators were scheduled to hear representatives of the region's three nuclear plants – Pilgrim in Plymouth, Vermont Yankee in Vernon, and Seabrook in New Hampshire—talk about the safety of their reactors in the light of the Japanese nuclear crisis. Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim have designs similar to the crippled Japanese nuclear plant. The nuclear disaster in Japan is likely to have major effects on US energy policy, according to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Buffet said that the \\"United States was poised to move ahead with nuclear plans here, but the events in Japan derailed that\\". In April 2011, Rochelle Becker, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility said that the United States should review its nuclear accident liability limits, in the light of the economic impacts of the Fukushima I nuclear disaster. In December 2011, as Japan completed \\"step 2\\" of its control roadmap at Fukushima, U.S. NRC chairman Jaczko visited the plant and said afterwards \\"that there was no longer enough energy in the reactors at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant to produce an offsite release of radiation, but pointed out that a large cleanup task remained\\". =Other= ;France In France around 1,000 people took part in a protest against nuclear power in Paris on 20 March, and some 3,800 French and Germans demonstrated for the closure of the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant on 8 April; a larger demonstration is expected on 25 April. Opinion polls on the topic indicated that 55% of the population were in favour of nuclear power in the days following Fukushima, but 57% against by the end of March. ;Germany In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen, with police estimating that 100,000 people turned out in Berlin alone. Hamburg, Munich and Cologne also saw big demonstrations. The New York Times reported that \\"most Germans have a deep-seated aversion to nuclear power, and the damage at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan has galvanized opposition\\". After Japan's nuclear disaster, there was an all-time best state election result for the anti-nuclear Green Party in Germany in the Baden-Württemberg election on 27 March 2011. However, the Greens' rise in popularity, which began October 2010 in the polls, has also been attributed to the unanimous opposition to Stuttgart 21. The CDU-led government under Chancellor Angela Merkel made an aboutface in their nuclear energy policy. In 2010 the Government had just prolonged the retention period of nuclear power plants which were scheduled to be phased out in 2021 by the nuclear phase-out plan of 2000. In light of the Fukushima disaster, the Government changed its mind: > A physicist by training and a former environment minister, Merkel understood > what Fukushima meant. Germany has 17 reactors, providing 23 percent of the > electrical power in the country and making it the sixth largest nuclear > electricity producer in the world. The eight oldest reactors were taken off > the grid within days of 3/11 and will not return to operation. In record > time, what once was the most pro-nuclear German government in decades > prepared comprehensive legislation to phase out the remaining nine reactors > by 2022 at the latest, starting in 2015. In June, parliament overwhelmingly > passed the law (513 in favor, 79 against, 8 abstentions). ;India In India, there has been rapid growth in energy use and there are plans to build the world's largest nuclear plant in Jaitapur, but anti-nuclear protests have intensified following the Fukushima crisis. On 18 April one man was shot and killed by police and eight were injured after protests against the planned Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project turned violent. Although protests have been ongoing for some years, they have gained greater prominence and support since Fukushima. ;Italy Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi announced in 2009 that Italy would go nuclear again after its four atomic power plants were shut down following a 1987 nationwide referendum. But in the wake of the Fukushima crisis, antinuclear rallies drawing thousands have erupted in Italy, and the Italian government has \\"decided on a one-year moratorium on its plans to revive nuclear power\\". A further Italian nuclear power referendum was held on 13 June 2011 and the No vote won 94,05 %, leading to cancellation of future nuclear power plants planned during the previous years, and due to the Italian nuclear power referendum turn out being over 50%+1 of the Italian population creates a legally binding cancellation of future plants. ;Spain In March 2011, hundreds of people took part in protests held across Spain to demand the closure of the country's six nuclear power stations, after Japan's nuclear accidents. Demonstrators, many with signs that read \\"No nuclear power, neither here nor in Japan\\", gathered in small groups in more than 30 cities, including Madrid, Barcelona, Seville and Valencia. ;Sweden A 2011 poll suggests that scepticism over nuclear power is growing in Sweden following Japan's nuclear crisis. 36 percent of respondents want to phase-out nuclear power, up from 15 percent in a similar survey two years ago. ;Switzerland Japan's Fukushima Dai- ichi nuclear disaster \\"has entirely changed the energy debate in Switzerland\\". In May 2011, some 20,000 people turned out for Switzerland's largest anti- nuclear power demonstration in 25 years. Demonstrators marched peacefully near the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant, the oldest in Switzerland, which started operating 40 years ago. Days after the anti-nuclear rally, Cabinet decided to ban the building of new nuclear power reactors. The country's five existing reactors would be allowed to continue operating, but \\"would not be replaced at the end of their life span\\". ;TEPCO violates Human Rights On 7 January 2014 the largest pension fund in The Netherlands announced, that it had sold all its investments in TEPCO, because the ABP found it unethical to invest in this company any longer. TEPCO was blamed for its conduct during and after the disaster. TEPCO had ignored the U.N. human rights, and had demonstrated that it had insufficient attention for public safety\\". There were insufficient measures to prevent environmental damage and it was impossible to move the company to different behavior. After all attempts of the ABP to change the attitude of the company had failed, all stock was sold in the first week of 2014. Re-evaluation of existing nuclear energy programs =Overview= Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its reactors and pledged to close the rest by 2022. The Italians have voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear. Switzerland and Spain have banned the construction of new reactors. Japan's prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in Japan's reliance on nuclear power. Taiwan's president did the same. Mexico has sidelined construction of 10 reactors in favor of developing natural-gas-fired plants. Belgium is considering phasing out its nuclear plants, perhaps as early as 2015. China—nuclear power's largest prospective market—suspended approvals of new reactor construction while conducting a lengthy nuclear-safety review. Neighboring India, another potential nuclear boom market, has encountered effective local opposition, growing national wariness about foreign nuclear reactors, and a nuclear liability controversy that threatens to prevent new reactor imports. There have been mass protests against the French-backed 9900 MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in Maharashtra and the 2000 MW Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu. The state government of West Bengal state has also refused permission to a proposed 6000 MW facility near the town of Haripur that intended to host six Russian reactors. In the United States, new-reactor construction has also suffered—not because of public opposition but because of economics and tougher, yet-to-be-determined, safety regulations. In 2007, U.S. utilities applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build 28 nuclear- power plants before 2020; now, if more than three come online before the end of the decade, it will be a major accomplishment. France is, per capita, the world's most nuclear-powered state. Frequently heralded as a nuclear commercial model for the world, today it's locked in a national debate over a partial nuclear phaseout. President Nicolas Sarkozy is still backing nuclear power, but his Socialist opponent, François Hollande, now well ahead in the polls, has proposed cutting nuclear power's electricity contribution by more than a third by 2025. =Africa= * Niger – In January 2012, President Mahamadou Issoufou said that Niger will continue with its plans to build a civilian nuclear power plant in cooperation with other West African countries in the ECOWAS, rather than letting the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters make Niger cancel its plans. He also stated that \\"In addition to renewable energy, nuclear energy is clean and low cost\\". =Americas= * Canada – On 16 March 2011, five days after the Fukushima I nuclear incident began, it was found that the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station in Pickering, Ontario, situated east of Toronto, was leaking demineralized water into Lake Ontario. While the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission declared that the leak, caused by a pump seal failure, did not pose any threat to human health, many Canadians questioned the safety of nuclear power plants in Canada. Gordon Edwards, Canadian physicist and founder of the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, claimed that the leak \\"shows the potential for more significant nuclear contamination of Lake Ontario [compared to that of Japan's disaster]\\". He added that the source of the Pickering plant's leak was the same as that of the incident at Fukushima I and that the leak must not be taken lightly. The Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station near Bécancour, Quebec, is the only Canadian nuclear power plant near a fault line. Quebec Premier Jean Charest issued statements that the Gentilly-2 reactor was safe, and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) declared it could withstand earthquakes. The CNSC created policies that would ensure that nuclear plants could keep reactors cool even in the event of a total power loss by having portable generators and pumps available to take over. As a final resort, Canadian nuclear plants are able to use fire apparatus to pump cooling water into the reactor. * Chile – In Chile, Emol reported on 16 March there has been much controversy over the installation of nuclear power plants, following the Chilean Government report that it was ready to sign a cooperation agreement with the United States Government on Nuclear Energy. The opposition urged a meeting on the plans with the Minister of Mines and Energy, Laurence Golborne. * United States – U.S. President Obama and aides for former Senator Domenici publicly supported continued development of new U.S. nuclear power facilities.Lobbyists’ Long Effort to Revive Nuclear Industry Faces New Test The influential The New York Times stated in an editorial on 14 March that \\"the unfolding Japanese tragedy also should prompt Americans to closely study our own plans for coping with natural disasters and with potential nuclear plant accidents to make sure they are, indeed, strong enough\\". A more definitive expression of the impact of the accidents in the United States was the decision by NRG Energy, Inc. to abandon already started construction on two new nuclear power plants in Texas. Analysts attributed the abandonment of the project to the financial situation of the plant-partner TEPCO, the inability raise other construction financing, the current low cost of electricity in Texas, and expected additional permitting delays. * Venezuela – Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced a halt to freeze all nuclear power development projects for peaceful means, which included design of a nuclear power plant for which a contract had been made with Russia. =Asia & Pacific= * Australia – The Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, stated in Melbourne, \\"I don't see nuclear energy as part of our future. We are blessed with abundant sources of renewable energy, of clean energy, of solar, wind, tide, hot rocks. That's our future, not nuclear...\\" per a Reuters report of 22 March 2011. Australia has no nuclear power stations. * China – ZSR reported on 14 March that During a News Conference of the Annual Meeting of National People's Congress of China, the Deputy Chief of Environmental Protection Authority of China, Mr Lijun Zhang had said: \\"We are concerned about the damage of the Nuclear Facility of Japan, concerned about the further development of this issue, we will learn from it, and will take it into account when we make strategic planning for the nuclear energy development in the future. However, our decision on development of more nuclear power plants and current arrangement on nuclear energy development will not be changed.\\" On 16 March, China froze nuclear plant approvals. On 28 March, the Chinese government revised nuclear power targets, which would likely result \\"in a reduction of about 10 gigawatts in nuclear generating capacity from the 90 gigawatts previously expected to be built by 2020.\\"Power group: China lowering nuclear target * India – The Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, ordered the Nuclear Power Corporation of India to review the safety systems and designs of all the nuclear power reactors on 15 March. The Government of India was reported on 15 March to also be looking to put in place additional environmental safeguards to ensure safety of newly proposed nuclear reactors. Nuclear Power Corporation of India said on 14 March that the nuclear power stations in India survived the earthquake of 2001 Bhuj earthquake and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami but there was \\"no room for complacency\\". * Israel – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated on 17 March 2011, that Israel was now unlikely to pursue civil nuclear energy. * North Korea – The Korean Central News Agency reported on 31 March that dissatisfaction with the Naoto Kan administration has risen concerning the accident response in Japan. Also, Rodong Sinmun reported, \\"The situation of the nuclear plant accident get worse and worse every day, and made the international society worry greatly\\". * Pakistan– The Government of Pakistan ordered the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) to check and review the power plants security, system, and designs of all the atomic power reactors in the country. The Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) issued safety guidelines in plants, and ordered to re-evaluate the designs of KANUPP-II and the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant in Chashman city, Pakistan today reported on 16 March 2011. The PAEC is continuously monitoring the flow of events in nuclear plants in Japan in the wake of the recent earthquake and tsunami there, APP concluded on 16 March 2011. According to the Jang News, Pakistan offered Japan to provide technical assistance to control to their nuclear radiation. On 20 March 2011, Jang News reported that scientists from PNRA and PAEC are ready to leave for Japan as soon as IAEA gives an approval. Japanese officials have accepted the Pakistan's offer, however, due to IAEA laws, both countries needs an approval from IAEA for such cooperation. According to the Foreign Office of Pakistan, Pakistani scientists are ready to leave for Japan as soon as IAEA gives an approval for such technical assistance. * Taiwan has ordered the suspension of its plans to expand nuclear power until a full safety review is complete. * Turkey – Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed his commitment of building Turkey's first nuclear plant at Akkuyu, Mersin Province. * In July 2011 Kuwait scrapped the plan to build four nuclear power plants by 2022. After the Fukushima disaster, opposition against the plans started to emerge. Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, emir of Kuwait, issued an order to dissolve the national nuclear energy committee. Besides the opposition, Kuwait is a small country, and it would be difficult to find a safe place for the nuclear waste the reactors would produce. Besides the cooperation with Japan, Kuwait did sign agreements on atomic energy with the United States, France and Russia. =Europe= * European Union – In an interview on ORF2, Austrian Environment Minister Nikolaus Berlakovich said that he would enter a request at the environmental meeting in Brussels on 14 March 2011 for a review of reactor safety. He emphasized both coolant and containment and compared these measures to reviews of the financial system after the banking crisis of 2008. :Connie Hedegaard, the European Commissioner for Climate Action stated on 17 March that generating energy from wind turbines at sea would be cheaper than building new atomic power plants. :On 23 March a European Union-wide stress test was announced after an emergency meeting of the European Council of Ministers on Energy. All 143 nuclear power plants in the Union were planned to be subject to an assessment and it was also hoped plants of neighbouring countries were taken into account. The evaluation would include \\"vulnerability to seismic events, their exposure to flooding, as well as man-made disasters (such as power cuts and terrorism), with special attention being paid to cooling and back-up systems.\\" * France – In a letter dated 23 March, Prime Minister Francois Fillon asked the Nuclear Safety Authority to carry out an 'open and transparent' audit each of its nuclear installations, looking at the risks of flood, earthquake, loss of power and cooling, and accident management processes, in order to identify any improvements that should be made in the light of lessons learned from Fukushima. The initial conclusions are expected by the end of 2011. France conducted a more limited review following flooding at its Blayais Nuclear Power Plant in 1999. President Nicolas Sarkozy has stressed the need for dialogue but said that France had chosen nuclear power for reasons of energy security and to counter greenhouse gas emissions. However pressure to permanently close the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant, the oldest in France, is growing within France and in neighbouring Switzerland and Germany. * Germany – During the chancellorship of Gerhard Schröder, the social democratic-green government had decreed Germany's final retreat from using nuclear power by 2022, but the phase-out plan was delayed in late 2010, when during the chancellorship of Angela Merkel the conservative-liberal government decreed a 12-year delay of the schedule. This delay provoked protests, including a human chain of 50,000 from Stuttgart to the nearby nuclear plant in Neckarwestheim. This protest had long been scheduled for 12 March, which now happened to be the day of the explosion of reactor block 1. Anti-nuclear demonstrations on 12 March attracted 100 000 across Germany. On 14 March 2011, in response to the renewed concern about the use of nuclear energy the Fukushima incident raised in the German public and in light of upcoming elections in three German states, Merkel declared a 3-months moratorium on the reactor lifespan extension passed in 2010. On 15 March, the German government announced that it would temporarily shut down 7 of its 17 reactors, i.e. all reactors that went online before 1981. Former proponents of nuclear energy such as Angela Merkel, Guido Westerwelle, Stefan Mappus have changed their positions, yet 71% of the population believe that to be a tactical manoeuvre related to upcoming state elections. In the largest anti-nuclear demonstration ever held in Germany, some 250,000 people protested on 26 March under the slogan \\"heed Fukushima – shut off all nuclear plants.\\" * Italy – A moratorium on the construction of nuclear power plants was approved on 24 March by the Council of Ministers of Italy for a period of 1 year. A further Italian nuclear power referendum was held on 13 June 2011 and the No vote won, leading to cancellation of future nuclear power plants planned during the previous years, and due to the Italian nuclear power referendum turn out being over 50%+1 of the Italian population creates a legally binding cancellation of future plants. * Netherlands – Maxime Verhagen, Minister of Energy, Agriculture and Innovation, wrote in a letter to the House of Representatives that the experience of Japan would be taken into account in the definition of the requirements for a new nuclear power plant to be built in 2015. Prime minister Mark Rutte indicated on 18 March there were no plans to change operations at Borssele nuclear power plant and called the German moratorium 'curious' (). * Slovakia – The Slovak republic said in the week after the accidents it would continue with the construction of two new VVER 440/V-213 reactors (PWR) at the Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant. All blocks at the Mochovce plant, existing and under construction, shall be updated and modernised to withstand higher earthquakes than the current limit. * Russia – On 15 March, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered officials to check Russian nuclear facilities and to review the country's ambitious plans to develop atomic energy amid Japan's nuclear crisis. * Spain – Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero ordered on 16 March a review of his country's nuclear power plants. * Switzerland – Swiss Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard announced on 14 March a freeze in the authorisation procedures for three new nuclear power plants, and ordered a safety review of the country's plants. * United Kingdom – On 12 March, British Energy Minister Chris Huhne wrote to Dr Mike Weightman, head of the HSE's Nuclear Directorate, asking for a report 'on the implications of the situation and the lessons to be learned for the UK nuclear industry. The report is to be delivered within 6 months, with an interim report by mid-May, 'prepared in close cooperation with the International nuclear community and other nuclear safety regulators'. On 15 March, Huhne expressed regret that some European politicians were 'rushing to judgement' before assessments had been carried out, and said that it was too early to determine whether the willingness of the private sector to invest in new nuclear plants would be affected. Dr Weightman visited Japan in May with an IAEA team. Renewable energy Nancy Folbre, an economics professor, has said that the biggest positive result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster could be renewed public support for the commercialization of renewable energy technologies. In 2011, London-based bank HSBC said: \\"With Three Mile Island and Fukushima as a backdrop, the US public may find it difficult to support major nuclear new build and we expect that no new plant extensions will be granted either. Thus we expect the clean energy standard under discussion in US legislative chambers will see a far greater emphasis on gas and renewables plus efficiency\\".HSBC (2011). Climate investment update: Japan's nuclear crisis and the case for clean energy. HSBC Global Research, 18 March. In 2011, Deutsche Bank analysts concluded that \\"the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways\\". As a consequence, \\"renewable energy will be a clear long-term winner in most energy systems, a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks. At the same time, we consider natural gas to be, at the very least, an important transition fuel, especially in those regions where it is considered secure\\".Deutsche Bank Group (2011). The 2011 inflection point for energymarkets: Health, safety, security and the environment. DB Climate Change Advisors, 2 May. In September 2011, Mycle Schneider said that the Fukushima disaster can be understood as a unique chance \\"to get it right\\" on energy policy. \\"Germany – with its nuclear phase-out decision based on a highly successful renewable energy program – and Japan – having suffered a painful shock but possessing unique technical capacities and societal discipline – can be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift toward a truly sustainable, low-carbon and nuclear-free energy policy\\".

Berlage was responsible for the urban concept (1915) and the architects of the Amsterdam School (partly expressionist architects) designed the implementation of the plan. Some years later Berlage was one of the leading architects of a new urban plan in Amsterdam, called Plan West (1922-1927). Here Berlage designed the center of Plan West, the architecture of the Mercatorplein (main square), see below. First project At the beginning of the 20th century, Berlage was asked by the Amsterdam city council to design a plan for developing the undeveloped area south of the city between the rivers Amstel and Schinkel. In 1904, Berlage presented an ambitious plan of winding streets, which was closely joined to the existing city. After research showed that this plan would be very costly and inefficient, Berlage was asked to go back to the drawing board.

This plan proved much more feasible and efficient. In 1917 the City Council granted approval to the plan. The New South district was built in the style of the Amsterdam School between 1917 and 1925, consisting of the Stadium District and the Apollo and the Rivers District. A large part of the New Pipe derives from the Plan Zuid. Berlage's design was only roughly implemented. On the spot where he had planned a teaching hospital, a large housing association designed by Michel de Klerk and Piet Kramer called \\"De Dageraad\\" (The Dawn) housing complex was built. It was opened in July 1922 by the alderman festive Housing, SR de Miranda.

Their reservation is the Mohegan Indian Reservation, located on the Thames River in Uncasville, Connecticut. Mohegan's independence as a sovereign nation has been documented by treaties and laws for over 350 years, such as the Treaty of Hartford secured by their Sachem (Chief) Uncas after his cooperation and victory with the English in the Pequot War (1637–1638). Although the Treaty of Hartford established English recognition of the tribe's sovereignty in 1638, after the colonial period and loss of lands, the tribe struggled to maintain recognition of its identity. For centuries its people were assumed by whites to have assimilated to majority culture. The tribe reorganized in the late 20th century and filed a federal land claims suit, seeking to regain land that the state of Connecticut had illegally sold. As part of the settlement, the Mohegan Nation gained federal recognition by the United States government in 1994. That year the US Congress passed the Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act. The US authorized the cleaned-up United Nuclear site for use as Mohegan reservation lands, and the property was transferred to the United States in trust for the tribe.Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 103-377, § 2, 108 Stat. 3501 (1994) (codified at 25 U.S.C. § 1775 (2006)) Gaining a sovereign reservation enabled the Mohegan to establish gaming operations on their lands to generate revenue for welfare and economic development of their tribe. They opened the Mohegan Sun casino on October 12, 1996, near the former Fort Shantok site above the Thames River.  Mohegan Tribe's vision  In 1997 the Mohegan Tribe's Council of Elders adopted the following Vision Statement: ::We are the Wolf People, children of Mundo, a part of the Tree of Life. Our ancestors ::form our roots, our living Tribe is the trunk, our grandchildren are the buds of our future. ::We remember and teach the stories of our ancestors. ::We watch. We listen. We learn. ::We respect Mother Earth, our Elders, and all that comes from Mundo. ::We are willing to break arrows of peace to heal old and new wounds. We acknowledge and learn ::from our mistakes. ::We walk as a single spirit on the Trail of Life. We are guided by thirteen generations ::past and responsible to thirteen generations to come. ::We survive as a nation guided by the wisdom of our past. Our circular trail returns ::us to wholeness as a people. ::.\\"Our Vision.\\" The Mohegan Tribe. Retrieved 6 Dec 2011.  History  Before the seventeenth century, the Mohegan were part of the Pequot Tribe, which emerged among Algonquian peoples located in south central present New England. = Uncas = The Mohegan Tribe's museum is the oldest Indian owned and operated museum in America. Gladys Tantaquidgeon along with her brother, Harold and father John, built the museum in 1931 in Uncasville, CT as a place to keep Mohegan treasures. The early 1600s were a critical period of change for Connecticut tribes, who spoke various Algonquian languages. The pressure from rapidly expanding European settlements created competition for land and resources, while new infectious diseases were decimating Indian populations at an alarming rate. Within the Pequot Tribe at that time, a dispute erupted between the Pequot Sachem (head chief) Sassacus and the leader Uncas. Uncas left with his followers, who called themselves the Mohegan, or Wolf People, like their ancestors. Each tribe had its own idea of how to deal with conflicts with the English and other Europeans. Uncas (1598–1683) became Sachem of the Mohegan Tribe, which favored collaboration with the English colonists. The Pequot under Sassacus chose to fight the colonists, and other local tribes took sides in the Pequot War, which lasted from 1637–1638. Seeing the great losses brought on by continued fighting, Uncas had befriended the European invaders. This controversial decision brought Uncas and the Mohegan people into an uneasy alliance with the English in the ensuing war with the Pequot (1637–1638). The Mohegan helped the English defeat the Pequot. Uncas settled his people in a village at Shantok on the Thames River, which the Tribe defended from a Narragansett invasion. It was sparked by related European as well as Indian conflicts. Finally, the Mohegan Tribe's alliance with the English kept its people relatively safe during the colonists attacks on Native Americans during King Philip's War and afterward.  Government  The Mohegan Tribe has created and maintained an independent governmental structure since before Europeans arrived in North America. The Mohegan Government has evolved to exercise full civil and criminal jurisdiction over their lands using the Constitution of the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut, which they wrote in the 20th century. The Mohegan Nation is governed by the Mohegan people. They elect a Tribal Council of nine Tribal Members and a Council of Elders, composed of seven Tribal Members. All legislative and executive powers of the Tribe not granted to the Council of Elders are vested with the Tribal Council. The Council of Elders oversees judicial matters and the tribe's cultural integrity. The Council of Elders also exercises legislative powers with respect to rules governing tribal membership and enrollment. The Tribal Court adjudicates on all non-gaming matters. Following Congressional passage of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, the Mohegan Nation used its cooperative relationship with the State of Connecticut to negotiate a gaming compact, after it had gained federal recognition in 1994 and receiving land in settlement under the Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act (1994). The US took into trust the cleaned-up United Nuclear site for use by the Mohegan as a sovereign reservation. The Tribe opened the Mohegan Sun casino in 1996, two years after gaining federal recognition. The compact created between Connecticut and the Mohegan Tribe secured 25 percent of slot revenues to the state to help fund services. It became a model agreement. Connecticut's Native American tribes have generated the highest revenues for the state aside from federal government installations. The government-to-government relationships that have developed between Connecticut and Mohegan have enabled quick resolutions to issues that have been raised, such as: regulation of indoor smoking, alcohol service, and state police presence at the reservation. = Community contributions = The Mohegan Tribe used its own funds to pay for the $35 million access road that enables visitors to reach Mohegan Sun without tying up Montville roads. The tribe has worked closely with its neighbors and provided the funding for an $11 million regional water project in order to ensure safe, clean drinking water. The tribe has been a strong advocate in the effort to ensure that Connecticut's communities get a greater share of slots revenues. It proposed a successful initiative to modify the funding formula so that communities most affected by the casinos receive additional funds from the Pequot-Mohegan Fund. In addition, the Mohegan Tribe pays $500,000 each year to the Town of Montville in lieu of taxes. The Mohegan Tribe is a partner in the Community Economic Development Fund. The revolving loan program will help regional small businesses create jobs. The tribe is the first and only non-bank investor in such a program in Connecticut. A member of the Mohegan Tribe sits on the board of trustees for the University of Connecticut.\\"Members of the Board\\" , University of Connecticut  Economy  The Mohegan Tribe has used gaming to generate revenue for economic development of the Tribe, its members, and the surrounding communities. Mohegan Sun employs about 10,000 individuals internally, while buying supplies and services from hundreds of small and medium-sized vendors and local companies that also employ thousands of individuals. Employees of the Tribes and Casinos pay all federal and state income taxes as well as other employment taxes, providing tens of millions of dollars to the state and federal governments. As mandated by federal law and the Mohegan Tribe's Constitution and laws, profits from Native American gaming go to support the health, education, welfare, and infrastructure of tribal governments. Although tribes are entitled to certain federal grants, by 1997 the Mohegan Tribe was in a position to return or reject funds. That year, it turned back $2.2 million in grant funds to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to be redistributed to other Native American nations. Since its opening in October 1996, the Mohegan Sun has generated substantial revenues for Connecticut's economy: *Approximately $2.5 billion in slot revenue contributions to the State of Connecticut *Over $4 billion is salaries, wages and benefits for employees *Over $6 billion in goods and services *Over $200 million in state taxes *Over $65 million in state services *Over $18 million in charitable donations The tribe is a part owner of the New England Black Wolves National Lacrosse League franchise, and full owner of the WNBA's Connecticut Sun.

Originally chartered in 1882, it was leased by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad (later the New York Central Railroad) in 1890 and was directly operated by that company afterwards. Much of the line was abandoned in the second half of the 20th century, though sections at both ends are still active. Origins and construction The company was originally chartered as the Susquehanna and South Western Railroad on August 12, 1882. That company's charter called for a line from Williamsport, Pennsylvania to the southern line of Clearfield County. The proposed line was initiated with the backing of the New York Central Railroad, as part of a far-reaching strategy to ensure access to bituminous coal reserves. The New York Central did not itself extend into the bituminous coalfields, making it vulnerable to action both by the coal operators who mined the coal and rivals like the Pennsylvania Railroad, who carried it. The coal operators of Tioga County, Pennsylvania, some of whom already shipped over the New York Central via the Fall Brook Coal Company's railroad system, faced irrepressible labor troubles and the impending exhaustion of their mines. William H. Vanderbilt, president of the New York Central, responded to the challenge by developing a plan to enter the Clearfield Coalfield, hitherto the exclusive preserve of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Vanderbilts would provide capital to a syndicate of Tioga coal operators and businessmen of the Clearfield area, incorporated as the Clearfield Bituminous Coal Company, who could acquire coal lands without arousing suspicion. The Fall Brook's rail network, extended down Pine Creek by a paper railroad called the Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway, would bring the New York Central's trains to Jersey Shore, on the West Branch Susquehanna River to the west of Williamsport. From there, the Susquehanna and South Western would head west by way of Beech Creek and Moshannon Creek to the vicinity of Clearfield. The initial incorporators of the railroad were William A. Wallace, B. L. Wallace, Israel Test, and E. H. Bigler, of Clearfield, S. R. Peale and William H. Brown of Lock Haven, John G. Reading and Joseph M. Gazzam, of Philadelphia. Gazzam was William Wallace's law partner; Reading, a wealthy banker, was Gazzam's father-in-law. William Wallace was appointed president. The railroad selected Samuel Brugger as its locating engineer: an experienced civil engineer, he had recently surveyed part of the same route on behalf of the Pennsylvania and Western Railroad, an independent vehicle of New York speculators which did not succeed in laying track. This allowed him to quickly complete his survey, which was approved by the board in September 1882. Bond of the Beech Creek Railroad Company, issued 17. November 1915 The Pennsylvania Railroad did relatively little to block the construction of the Susquehanna and South Western. The failed Pennsylvania and Western had induced the Pennsylvania to charter the Lock Haven and Clearfield Railroad in 1879, which would have built from their Bald Eagle Valley Railroad at the mouth of Beech Creek to their Tyrone and Clearfield Railroad at Philipsburg, the same route that the Susquehanna and South Western would take, but never initiated construction. The Pennsylvania may have been influenced by a report from one of their civil engineers, Camille d'Invilliers, prepared in December 1883, which suggested that the Moshannon seam was being exhausted in the older collieries in the Philipsburg and Houtzdale area. Coal from the Moshannon seam enjoyed a high reputation, and d'Invilliers suggested that the Pennsylvania should concentrate on new fields exploiting the Moshannon seam, in the upper Moshannon Valley and elsewhere, and allow the New York Central to compete for the lower seams of Kittanning coal remaining in the Philipsburg area. The only known surviving copy of his report is in the archives of the Fall Brook Coal Company; this company was an ally of the New York Central in penetrating the coalfield, suggesting that the Pennsylvania and New York Central came to an understanding to allow the Beech Creek's construction. The Susquehanna and South Western financed its construction with the issue of $4,000,000 in stock. Nearly all of the initial issue was purchased by William Wallace, Peale, and Reading, but these purchases were financed by the Vanderbilts and George Magee of the Fall Brook Coal Company, to whom most of that stock was then transferred starting in January 1883. Construction began at the end of 1882, starting at the town of Beech Creek and proceeding west along the creek to Mountaintop, in the vicinity of Snow Shoe. The company changed its name to the Beech Creek, Clearfield, and South Western Railroad on March 20, 1883. Around this time, it increased the stock issue to $5,000,000 and issued an additional $5,000,000 in fifty-year bonds. The Clearfield Bituminous Coal Company signed a contract to ship exclusively over the new railroad, and George Magee was appointed general contractor for construction. The new line was built to high standards in anticipation of heavy coal traffic. It eschewed severe grades, at the cost of extensive curvature and bridges as it followed Beech Creek, and the Hogback tunnel, which cut across a loop of the creek, about halfway up the climb out of the watershed at Hurxthal's Summit. Tracklaying began in September of 1883. In the meantime, construction began on the Peale tunnel west of the summit, on the descent approaching Moshannon Creek. Undertaken by the well-known railroad contractors P & T Collins, tunneling began on June 24, 1883 and the bore was holed through on October 30. It was ready for rail traffic by the middle of the next year. further west, the line crossed the creek on an iron viaduct high, opened for service on November 11, 1884. NYC subsidiary The company failed and was sold to the newly organized Beech Creek Railroad on June 29, 1886.

Ugbokhare is surrounded by the villages of Udowo, Ewu, Ivue and Ibore. History According to history the origin of the ugbokhare.http://reclaimnaija.net/voters_register/?state_id=12&lga;_id=221&ra;_id=2553 It is not possible in any circumstance for people to migrate from Otuo to farm in Ugbokhare Irrua. Ugbokhare people came from villages, perhaps neighbouring villages as farm settlers. Hence the name Ugbo a re re ( It was farming we came for) The names of the villages have not been historically proven. The neighboring village, Ibore came from Otuo, This has been histo-culturally proven. The first settlers in Ugbokhare are known as Ikpokhulun, which constitute one of the families in Ugbokhare.This is the original history as confirmed from the elders according to tradition. Leadership The people of Ugbokharehttp://www.alibris.com/search/books/isbn/9781156548226 are under the leadership of the eldest man who is called Odion Ugbokhare, who has a messenger or personal assistant called Ukor Idion and other subordinates. The Odion Ugbokhare in turn takes directions also from the Onojie of Irrua who is called the Okaijesam of Esan land. The land of Ugbokhare comprises three clans which is named after the three brothers they are referred to as Uwelen Uzebu who is said to be the eldest brother followed by Uwelen Eneghi the second and the third is Uwelen Edomae. These clans are located in different areas of the village which are Egbemia, Abughe, Ibhiagbe, Ichechiala, Otoukho, Ukpagor, Izebu and Ukpofan.

This god is represented by bees and snakes, both of which were their protector in time of war. The ugbokhare youth movement both home and abroad celebrate their togetherness/annual meeting every Easter using ugbokhare primary school as their venue. Traditional Dance The people of ugbokhare are known for igbabornelimi, asono and Igieleghe. the igbabonelimi is in the form of masquerade and is mainly danced by the uwelen edomaes and is mainly done by males while the asono and Igieleghe are done by both.

This organization believes that human beings face two futures and one choice: a world without nuclear weapons or a world ruined by them. 2FP is supportive of concrete and practical steps to reduce nuclear dangers immediately, while pursuing the multilateral, global, irreversible, and verifiable elimination of nuclear weapons, as a biblically-grounded mandate and as a contemporary security imperative. In order to make these changes in the world they are using a strategy based around the creation of a non-partisan, conscience- driven, enduring majority of Americans who are committed to a nuclear weapons- free world. Two Futures Project seeks to join together one voice of Christian conscience, to encourage and enable national leaders to make the complete elimination of nuclear weapons the organizing principle of American nuclear weapons policy. The founder and director of the Two Futures Project is Rev. Tyler Wigg-Stevenson. Activities The Two Futures Project continues to work in many areas. The activities of 2FP include participation in the 2009 Q Conference. As well as continuing contributions in 2010 to www.qideas.org. 2FP participated in forums at Washington National Cathedral in 2009 and Malone University in 2010. The larger work of Two Futures Project is in the area of making change and here 2FP has been active with work on the New START Treaty, a conference parallel to the Nuclear Summit conference held in 2010, and 2FP has also been active in commenting on the Nuclear issue like in the case of the Posture Review. As the Two Futures Project continues to participate in this array of activities they have not forgotten their Christian calling and continue to bring the Christian community into these activities as well.

The game centers on battles between the player's army and enemy monsters or computer-controlled players. The characters in the army are generated using the sounds of the player's own voice, and then engage in side-scrolling combat with the enemy. The game was created in concert with Koto Laboratories, and was announced on Facebook one week prior to release. It was critically panned by reviewers, who praised for its novel concept but dismissed the title as a short-lived gimmick with very little gameplay or replayability.  Gameplay  A battle against the demon king, with two characters currently attacking, named \\"Square\\" and \\"Enix\\" Voice Fantasy consists of fighting an enemy by sending an army of customized characters to fight against them. The game contains three modes of play; \\"Single Match\\", where players battle other players, \\"Tag Match\\" where they battle in groups of two, and the primary \\"Demon King\\" mode, where monsters are battled instead. Once battle commences, all battle actions and commands are automated. The game is single-player only; matches against other \\"players\\" are held against computer-controlled heroes. The player starts by creating characters to fight for them; they do so by speaking any word into the microphone to build the character on. Based on the pitch of the player's voice, rather than the word said, a character will be created with different levels of eight different combat attributes such as abilities, personality, and jobs such as a warrior or a mage. As the characters players have created attack, they repeat the sound or words the player used to create them, sometimes using a different pitch level. The game holds up to 50 characters, and characters can be saved or deleted after each round of combat. Battles take place in a side-on view. Other than creating the initial characters, the player has no control over their actions or the rest of the game.  Development  Developer studios Koto Laboratories contributed to the software development and sound implementation. On February 22, 2010, Square Enix registered a trademark for Voice Fantasy. Some excitement and discussion preceded the release of the game, when a week before its release, Square Enix posted on their Facebook page that they were releasing a game allowing players to create characters with their voices, and some speculated it was related to a previously released game called Song Summoners. The game was released on iOS on November 1, 2010. On February 18, 2011, the game was updated so that players could play as any of the three main characters from the highly acclaimed video game Secret of Mana.  Reception  Two major concerns of reviewers were the lack of ability by the player to participate in combat, and prevent any mistakes by the in game AI, and the inability of the characters to gain a higher level through experience points like other role playing games, making any weak skilled characters not worth playing with at all. IGN referred to the game as a tech demo, citing its lack of extensive gameplay or story, and rated the game 5/10, or \\"Mediocre\\". Reviewers cited that other than brief laughter with friends at the strange or obscene things they got their characters to say, the length of gameplay could be measured in minutes. Touch Arcade classified it as on the border between a game and an entertainment app because of its brevity and its lack of interactivity, but recommended it for playing in the presence of friends to show the iPhones unique gaming capabilities. Pocket Gamer, on the other hand, said that it \\"can be described as more a microphone tech demo than serious game\\", and felt that there was so little gameplay involved in the app that \\"it's questionable it even deserves to be called a game\\". The game was praised for its novelty by The Escapist, who approved of Square Enix's attempt to create a game specifically using the strengths of the game system it was making games for, and also trying something new instead of more efforts at porting older games. The graphics were also praised for their retro and colorful graphics style, and was named \\"App of the Day\\" by The Unofficial Apple Blog. It has also been noted that the spells, monsters, names and music of the game do not come from any established Final Fantasy game, making the \\"Fantasy\\" title feel \\"tacked on.\\" Both the Touch Arcade and 148 Apps reviews stated that the game was better as an app to show the player's friends the interesting concept than as a game to play.

In 2008-2009, Somerset High School's (now Somerset Berkley) SAT averages were 504 in Reading, 488 in Writing, and 519 in Mathematics. Athletics Somerset Berkley Regional High School competes in Division Two of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association. Current sports include: Baseball, Boys & Girls Basketball, Cheerleading, Boys & Girls Cross Country, Field Hockey, Football, Golf, Gymnastics, Ice Hockey, Boys & Girls Soccer, Softball, Boys & Girls Spring & Winter Track, Boys & Girls Tennis, Volleyball, & Wrestling. Teams are fielded at the Varsity, Junior Varsity, or Freshman levels, depending on the sport. Most teams compete in the Eastern Athletic Conference (EAC), which also includes Bishop Feehan High School, Bishop Stang High School, Coyle and Cassidy High School, and Martha's Vineyard Regional High School. The school's traditional athletic rivals are the Cardinals of Joseph Case High School in Swansea, Massachusetts. The annual Thanksgiving Day football game between Somerset and Swansea is a local tradition. Music The Somerset Music Department became notable under the direction and leadership of Dr. Robert Perry in the late 1960s. At that time the town acquired its \\"Musictown\\" nickname. Musical groups at that time consisted of marching band, concert band, orchestra, chorus, glee club, show group, women's chorus, and string ensemble. The annual Musictown celebration also began in the 1960s. It consists of a Kiddies Day (when the kids come march with the marching band), a King and Queen Judging Day, Concert Night, a Pops Night, a Musictown Ball, and a Musictown Festival Grand Day that takes place on the last day. The final day starts with field show presentations by the invited bands and the Somerset Blue Raider Marching Band and a parade that commences at 2:00 PM and lasts approximately 3–8 hours. As of 2008, the Musictown Festival consisted of the King and Queen judging Day, the Musictown Ball, the Kiddies Day, the Pops Night, the Concert Night, and the Grand Day. Every five years Somerset invites Somerset High School alumni and alumnae to perform with the current students in various music groups. This last occurred in 2013. The music department at Somerset High School now contains concert band, symphonic band, orchestra, string ensemble, concert choir, treble choir, 'Blue Raider' marching band, winter percussion ensemble, winter guard, jazz band, chorale, and the 'Electrify' show choir. Most of these groups have been within the department for many years. Under new director David Marshall, the 'Blue Raider' marching band made its return as a competing group in the Fall of 2007 with their field show of 'Wicked.' The group doubled in size in one year to about 60 members and traveled to Allentown, Pennsylvania, in November 2008, to compete in the USSBA Northeastern Championships. It received the title of Best Percussion in the 2A division and also won 3rd best color guard and 4th best music. The group tied for 5th overall in the division. The band also competes in the NESBA circuit of shows. In 2008-2009 it performed 'King Kong' and 'Hydrodynamics.' The following academic year it staged 'Heartbeat' and captured 2nd place with a score of 91.7, breaking the 90 mark for the first time since becoming an ensemble. Tim Sepe instituted the Winter Percussion ensemble in 2007. Student members practice with percussion instruments such as xylophones, marimbas, vibraphones, drums, and other auxiliary percussion equipment with added guitar, bass, and keyboard parts. The 2007 group was a concert percussion group and played jazz classics such as 'Take the A Train' and 'Conga.' Matt Cavanaugh headed the 2008-2009 season, when the group transitioned to an indoor marching ensemble. It performed the show 'The Pursuit' and competed on the NESBA circuit during the winter of 2008 through 2009. The 'Electrify' show choir was formed in the 2004-2005 year by Micheal Winslow. The group travels as a singing and dancing group much like the show group that was part of the department many years ago. As there is no established circuit, the group travels to many area schools and performs in competition. It even hosts its own show dubbed the 'New England Show Choir Classic.' Although currently headed by David Weeks and Samuel Bianco, Electrify garnered several plaques and trophies during the 2008-2009 season under the leadership of director Richard Sylvia. The pit band, directed by David Marshall, is also a crucial component of Electrify and has won several trophies. Other former directors include: Ramsey Kurdi, Richard Sylvia, and Andrew Arcello. The current acting Fine & Performing Arts Coordinator is Ira Schaefer. He replaced Lori Anderson after she retired in June 2013. She also directed the Strings groups. Somerset High School is also home to a drama department which overlaps the choral and band aspects of the music department. Past performances include \\"Beauty & The Beast\\" (2016), Into the Woods (2015), Legally Blonde (2012), Guys and Dolls (2004 & 2014), Fiddler on the Roof (2003 & 2011), Jekyll and Hyde (2006), Aida (2005), Little Shop of Horrors (2010), Side Show (2009), West Side Story (2008), and Grease (2007). The current Music Teachers of SBRHS are Mr. David Marshall, Mr. Samuel Bianco & Ms. Stephanie Isidoro. Regionalization Before 2011, high school students from Berkley attended Somerset High School through a special tuition agreement between the two towns. Under this agreement, the Town of Berkley paid for the right of their students to attend Somerset High School. However, the school was run by the School Committee of the Town of Somerset, in which Berkley residents held no formal representation. Debate about the creation of a regional high school - in which both Somerset and Berkley residents would be represented - existed for many years. However, the issue gained little political traction until a variety of factors - mainly the lingering end of the tuition agreement and the rapid deterioration of the Somerset High School building - brought the issue to the forefront of political debate in both towns in 2009-2010. In August 2010, Massachusetts Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education Mitchell D. Chester formally approved a regional school district agreement voted on by the two towns that created a regional school district between Berkley and Somerset at the high school level. Under the agreement, each town will pay a share of the school's budget proportional to their percent representation among the student body. Seats on the Somerset Berkley Regional School Committee, which will govern the school, will be divided similarly. Buildings =1937 building= Former Somerset High School building, built 1937, demolished 2014Construction on the old Somerset High School building was completed in 1937 to a design by Israel T. Almy of Fall River, to replace the original 1885 building that was burned down in 1935. A 2010 report by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) declared that the physical condition of the current high school building “does not adequately support” educational programs and support services.http://www.heraldnews.com/archive/x1024318925/Conditions-at-Somerset- High-School-may-jeopardize-accreditation#ixzz1GpG6X0pc Difficult conditions in the building include “a lack of adequate space in certain instructional areas”, limited handicapped accessibility, out-of-date fire safety equipment, a small gymnasium space, and poor ventilation.http://www.heraldnews.com/news/education/x1024318925/Conditions- at-Somerset-High-School-may-jeopardize-accreditation Questions about the structural integrity of the building's foundation led to some areas of the building being condemned during the 2008-2009 school year. The building was originally constructed as a project of the Works Progress Administration, but has since grown considerably with the addition of several new wings over the years. The Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) offered a significant amount of financial assistance to the Town of Somerset to fund a new high school building should it choose to form a regional high school with Berkley. Upon completion of the new building in 2017, the 1937 building was demolished and soccer fields built in that location. =2014 building= Rear of building, entrances to the robotics lab. In September 2014, students returned to a brand new, $82.3 million building, constructed immediately adjacent to the old facility. The new \\"state of the art\\" building features a modern two-story library with oak paneling, a 70-seat lecture hall with internet and camera outlets, and an 800-seat double-tiered auditorium with a sound system. The cafeteria opens to a concrete patio for eating outdoors. The gym seats 3,200 and has a walnut floor with a four-layer cushioning, and includes hydraulic lifts to move heavy gym mats. A highlight of the new building is a robotics lab which is used by the school's Engineering Technology Program. In December 2016, students from Somerset Berkley, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, won first place for industrial design in a competition in Canton, Massachusetts. Students asked the Regional School Committee to secure funds for building a robot competition practice arena in the high school.

The plot follows a retired ninja warrior, now married to an American woman, moves to Los Angeles at his wife's request in order to begin a new life for their two sons. Shortly after their arrival, he is mistakenly drawn into a protracted conflict with an L.A. crime boss and his vicious henchmen. He is forced by a series of brutal circumstances to come out of retirement and bring the criminals to justice. Plot At the insistence of his American-born wife, Aiko, Yokohama salaryman Akira Saito decides to immigrate from Japan to the United States to raise their two sons Takeshi and Tomoya. Unbeknownst to his family, Akira is in fact a highly skilled ninja, who had faithfully protected the secrets of his temple minded by his adoptive father and sensei, Koga. Years before, Akira's brother, Shoji (also raised and trained by Koga) sought to steal from the temple while in disguise, forcing Akira to engage him in battle and kill him. Akira's meditation on this matter is disrupted by an attack from Koga to encourage him to wipe the guilt from his mind before it kills him. Akira announces his intentions to move to America to start a new life, to put the shadows of the ninja behind him. Koga makes him swear never to reveal their secrets, and gives him a ninja helmet as a gift, while reminding him he can never leave his shadows behind. In Los Angeles the Saitos meet with Sam Green, the widowed owner of a closed restaurant and apartment that Akira and Aiko have bought. After the sale is completed, the cigar store area of the building is broken into by police Sgt. Trumble, a corrupt cop, along with his partner Sgt. Joe Daly. Both work for local mobster Mr. Newman. Daly removes loose floor boards and puts a large white box underneath, containing the Van Adda necklace. However, he reconsiders and double-crosses the mob, taking the necklace. The next day Newman's enforcer, Limehouse Willie, waits until the building is deserted, only to discover the necklace is gone. Seeing Sam Green's packed luggage in his car, Willie incorrectly surmises that he's skipping town with the jewels. He brutally kills Green, even though he doesn't find the necklace. His suspicion now falls on the Saito family. The next day, as Akira and Aiko enjoy their first day of business as \\"Aiko's Japanese Restaurant\\", Tomoya and Takeshi go out to the local store and are confronted by local bullies eyeing Takeshi's bicycle. Tomoya, who has a red belt in karate, defends his younger brother and beats up the bullies. During the fight, Willie abducts Tomoya and leaves Takeshi with a broken nose when he tries to stop him. Willie phones Akira demanding that he deliver the necklace (of which he knows nothing) to Pier 25 in exchange for his son's life. Curious, he goes into the cigar store and finds the broken door lock, the loose floor boards, and a grey thread from Daly's suit jacket, which shows Daly is left-handed. Akira arrives empty- handed at the pier and boards one of the ships and is restrained by Willie and his men. Akira's claims that it was a left-handed man in a grey suit that took the necklace. Willie cuts him across the chest and threatens his son with a blow torch. Akira smashes the light above his head and uses his ninja skills to escape with Tomoya. He listens to Aiko and goes to the police the next day. Meanwhile, although Willie is convinced that the necklace isn't with the Saitos, Newman still wants them eliminated because of what they know. At the precinct, Akira speaks with Lt. Anderson. Both Trumble and Daly are there as he identifies Willie from mug shots. Anderson can do nothing to keep him away from the Saitos without evidence, so Akira agrees to help him obtain it. Daly informs Newman and is assured Willie will clean up his mess, but also says they need to have \\"a little chat\\". At the Saitos' apartment, Takeshi accidentally kicks his soccer ball out the window, and Tomoya goes out to recover it. Aiko chases after him and both are run down by Newman's thugs stationed outside in their car. Akira arrives seconds afterwards and recognizes the thugs from the night before and gives chase in his car, then on foot. The resulting struggle results in both men being killed. Tomoya is on life support at the hospital, while Aiko is bruised but still being kept overnight for observation. Anderson arranges for police protection to guard them. Akira sneaks on board Willie's yacht during a party and cuts the power and sneaks up behind him. With a knife to Willie's throat, he warns him to stay away from the Saitos or he \\"will pray for death\\". Akira has vanished by the time the lights come back on. Ignoring the threat, Willie sneaks into the hospital and murders Aiko, but is stopped by Anderson and his men before he can also kill Tomoya. He is able to escape during the confusion. Akira returns to the hospital to have a moment with his wife's body. He swears he will make Willie and his men pay for destroying their dreams by returning to the ninja shadow world. He takes Tomoya out of hospital care against Anderson's warnings that they cannot guarantee police protection if he does so. Elsewhere, Daly and Trumble meet at a restaurant. Willie shows up and murders them both for their treachery. Akira relocates the boys to a warehouse. Behind closed doors, he performs rituals that signify his return to the ways of ninjitsu, and, with a makeshift forge, he creates a new ninja-to sword blade. In full ninja garb, Akira prays to Aiko's spirit before donning the helmet his father gave him. He attacks Newman's mansion, dispatching Newman and all his henchmen in what quickly becomes an all-out massacre. Willie is able to escape, but Akira later confronts him when Willie shows up at the warehouse. They fight a protracted duel to the death until Willie ultimately winds up being pinned through his wrists by Akira to a long buzzsaw platform. He opens his mask and Willie recognizes him before Akira turns on the buzzsaw and begins slowly walking away. Willie then begins to beg him to kill him (literally praying for death) as the spinning blade draws in the mobster and slowly slices the screaming Willie in half. In the final sequence, Akira and his sons are visiting Aiko's grave. As they are leaving, they are approached by Anderson, who discusses the massacre, mentioning that it's rumoured that the assassin was a ninja and asks if they still exist. Akira denies this with Takeshi confirming it and saying the detective has been watching too many ninja movies. Anderson wishes Akira good luck, but as he leaves he tells him that if he sees the ninja to tell him that the police don't want to see him again. He then tosses him a shuriken left behind at the crime scene (it's implied that he knows Akira is the ninja in question). They bow respectfully and part company as the credits begin.

It was the first of The Ex's albums to feature Luc playing bass guitar and he would remain as the band's bass player for 20 years. The album also featured many guest musicians, a notable trend in The Ex's discography that would provide musical elements unique to each of their albums. Background Blueprints for a Blackout saw The Ex starting to expand beyond the standard guitar-bass-drum format of punk with forays into other instruments such as organ, beer crates, and oil barrels. In the transition from December of 1983 to January 1984 The Ex spent two weeks improvising, writing and recording at Dolf's Koeienverhuur \\"Cow Rental\\" Studio in rural Schellingwoude outside of Amsterdam. New songs were developed by the musicians, after which vocalist G.W. Sok wrote lyrics and recorded vocals, and these supplemented preexisting songs that the band had played live at the time. The group had also made field recordings to add as samples to their tracks, including an oil-barrel dropped down several stories of concrete stairs, or the sound of a marching army The band also began to experiment creating effects with long loops of analog tape and had guest collaborators in The Mekons' Jon Langford, Marcel Schmidt, Alex van Zanten, and members of various Dutch groups. The record's front sleeve image was taken from the Swiss documentary Heute Und Danach (“Today and Thereafter”) and contained a 12\\" square 20-page lyric-and-photo booklet, as well as a full-size poster about the recent eviction of the Wyers squat in Amsterdam. The original double-LP saw release in February 1984 on The Ex's own Pig Brother Productions imprint, and debuted on CD, along with The Ex's entire back catalog, in 1993 on the band's own label, Ex Records. The band has included the album as part its downlaod and streaming catalog via Bandcamp. Reception John Dougan of Allmusic writes: \\"Double-album. Simplistic and excessive but interesting. Out of print.\\" Tracks 2 to 4 were selected as highlights. Trouser Press wrote that the band \\"[employ] such musical implements as organ, beer crates and oil barrels [...] further expanding its sonic palette with guest musicians.\\" An unattributed review on the band's official website reads: \\"It's caustic. A real burner. [...] While still retaining an all important relevant edge to their musical comment , they've introduced elements of tunesmithing, attack, decay and composition that places them head and shoulders above their contemporaries.\\" Track listing #\\"Streetcars Named Desire\\" / \\"Animal Harm\\" (medley) #\\"Blueprints for a Blackout\\" #\\"Rabble with a Cause\\" #\\"Requiem for a Rip-Off\\" #\\"Pleased to Meat You\\" #\\"A Goodbuy to You\\" #\\"The Swim\\" #\\"Boohoo\\" #\\"U.S. Hole\\" #\\"(Not) 2b Continued\\" #\\"Grimm Stories\\" #\\"A Plague to Survive\\" #\\"The Rise of the Dutch Republic\\" #\\"Kidnap Connection\\" #\\"Fire and Ice\\" #\\"Jack Frost Is Innocent\\" #\\"Love You Till Eh\\" #\\"Food On 45\\" #\\"Scrub That Scum\\" Personnel =The Ex= *Terrie (guitar) *G.W.

His nomination to a life-tenure, federal district court judgeship during 2010 and 2011 ran aground amid opposition from Republican senators, who objected to moving forward with a United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary hearing on his nomination after what were reported to be \\"insurmountable concerns\\" by Republicans over matters raised during Day's background investigation.  Early life and education  Born in Dothan, Alabama, Day earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the University of Maryland in 1978, a master's degree in judicial administration in 1980 from American University and a J.D. degree in 1984 from the University of Maryland School of Law.  Professional career  Day began his legal career in 1985 as an assistant state's attorney for Montgomery County, Maryland. In 1989, he joined the Washington, D.C. law firm Sherman, Meehan, Curtin & Ain, working as a civil litigation attorney with the firm, being promoted to partner in 1995.  Work as a magistrate judge  In 1997, Day was appointed by the judges on the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to be a federal magistrate judge.  Nomination to federal district court  On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Day to a judicial seat on the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, to fill the vacancy created by the Judge Peter Jo Messitte to take senior status. Day's nomination lapsed at the end of 2010, and President Obama renominated him on January 5, 2011. However, Day's nomination languished for more than a year, and he never received a hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, which is the standard procedure for a judicial nominee to be considered for a floor vote before the full Senate. NPR commented on the delay in an August 4, 2011 article, stating that \\"Some of the longest waiting nominees, Louis Butler of Wisconsin, Charles Bernard Day of Maryland and Edward Dumont of Washington happen to be black or openly gay\\".Carrie Johnson, Obama Gets High Marks For Diversifying The Bench, NPR (August 4, 2011). Without comment, Obama withdrew Day's nomination on October 31, 2011. After Day's nomination was withdrawn, a spokeswoman for U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, told the Blog of Legal Times in an e-mail that some committee members had \\"insurmountable concerns\\" about matters raised during Day's background investigation. Those concerns, which the spokeswoman declined to elaborate on, were what prompted Republican senators to block a committee hearing on Day. The spokeswoman also told the Blog of Legal Times that Day \\"is aware of those problems and is free to share that information if he so desires.\\" In the wake of the failed nomination, Maryland's two Democratic senators, Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin, issued a joint statement stating that they were \\"very disappointed\\" that Day's nomination had stalled in committee. \\"Judge Day is an extraordinary jurist, greatly respected by the Maryland legal community,\\" the statement read. \\"He has the experience and qualities that are needed in our judges. He also understands the day to day lives of ordinary Americans, and the need for their rights to be protected.\\" See also * Barack Obama judicial appointment controversies  References  External links *Judicial profile from the District of Maryland *Faculty profile from American University Washington College of Law 1957 births Living people People from Dothan, Alabama People from Maryland American lawyers University of Maryland, Baltimore alumni African-American judges United States magistrate judges American University alumni University of Maryland School of Law alumni ","title":"Charles Bernard Day"},{"id":"31207486","text":"Carmelo Héctor Giuliano González (born June 14, 1951), is a former Argentine football defender.

His brother, Raymond de La Nézière (1865-1953) became an illustrator.L'Étang, G. and Arsaye, J-P., La Peinture en Martinique, HC, 2007, p.18 His younger brother, Georges de la Nézière was killed in action in the first World War. As a child, Joseph was a very good student and learned piano, violin and Latin- Greek. He studied painting with artist, Alfred Roll, a member of the Beaux- Arts Academy. La Nézière traveled extensively in North Africa and the Far East and became a well-known Orientalist artist. He was a member of the Geographic Society. He held various administrative roles with the French Colonial office which had embarked on a sophisticated program to reform the arts industries in colonial France. La Nézière employed many Orientalist painters to assist him and also employed both men and women in equal numbers.Benjamin, R., Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880-1930, University of California Press, 2003, pp 203-04 In around 1919, he headed a project based in Rabat, Morocco to produce some 300 Oriental rugs under the auspices of the Office des Industries d'Artes Indigenes.

While the group of algal species is large, it is generally accepted that algae is high in nutritional value and often contain a variety of concentrated vitamins and minerals.Belay, A., Ota, Y., Miyakawa, K., & Shimamatsu, H. (1993). Current knowledge on potential health benefits of Spirulina. Journal of applied Phycology, 5(2), 235-241. Algophagy as a feeding behaviour was first noted in literature by Deonier (1972) in their explanation of feeding habits of shore flies Diptera ephydridae. In this context, this term was used to describe the behaviour of these flies consuming and digesting algal matter. Deonier (1972) found results to support this behaviour, but this feeding style has also been noted in other animals in recent literature. While this behaviour has been noted in a variety of insects (specifically Ameletus mayflies), it has also been observed in other invertebrates such as the crab Carcinus maenas and the Nanorchestes mite. Additionally, this behaviour has been noted in vertebrates such as the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, the sheep Ovis aries, and the chicken Gallus gallus domesticus. This feeding behaviour has more recently been adopted by humans as well.  Examples in invertebrates  Algophagy is a feeding behaviour found commonly amongst many invertebrate species. Some examples of these observations include the mayfly, mites, and certain species of crab. Ameletus mayfly in an algae bed Mayflies are a group of insects found to feed off of epilithic algae from near streams in New Mexico, United States.Peterson, C. G., Vormittag, K. A., & Valett, H. M. (1998). Ingestion and digestion of epilithic algae by larval insects in a heavily grazed montane stream. Freshwater Biology, 40(4), 607-623. In a study to examine ingestion and digestion of algae by larval insects, Peterson (1998) analyzed the fecal composition of varying insect larvae and nymphs. All species studied showed epilithic algae in their fecal matter, markedly in the multiple species of mayfly. This study outlines the feeding behaviours used by specifically the Ameletus mayflies to feed off of and digest algae as a source of food. This observation has also been noted in species of mites. The Nanorchestes mite is a small invertebrate of the genus PachygnathoidKrantz, G. W., & Lindquist, E. E. (1979). Evolution of phytophagous mites (Acari). Annual Review of Entomology, 24(1), 121-158. that lives in the ground and is often found in extremophilic conditions. Krantz and Lindquist (1979) made observations of these mites feeding and surviving off of green algae, while also delving into the background theory behind this theory. The authors argue that algal microflora predates that of vascular plants, a step to understanding the evolutionary pathway that follows algophagy. Because of this flora timeline, the mites relied on algae as an early source of nutrition, an example in support of algophagy as a feeding behaviour. These examples of this feeding behaviour are also supported by observations of certain species of crab. The green crab is a highly invasive species found on nearly all continents of Earth. This littoral crab is an omnivore with a large array of preferred foods, forming an important ecological connection with many ocean environments. In a study performed by Ropes (1968) 3,979 green crabs were sampled and their gut contents were analyzed to reveal that algae was one of the two consumed plant foods.Ropes, J. W. (1968). The feeding habits of the green crab, Carcinus maenas (L.). Fishery Bulletin, 67(2), 183-203 This was replicated in other studies such as that of Baeta, Cabral, Marques, and Pardal (2006) which also found these results nearly 40 years later.Baeta, A., Cabral, H. N., Marques, J. C., & Pardal, M. A. (2006). Feeding ecology of the green crab, Carcinus maenas (L., 1758) in a temperate estuary, Portugal. Crustaceana, 79(10), 1181-1193. This marks yet another incidence of invertebrate algophagy feeding, adding to the growing body of literature to explain this behaviour.  Examples in vertebrates  Algophagy has been observed in a variety of vertebrate species, such as the chimpanzee, species of sheep, and also in the common chicken. A chimpanzee species found to consume algae The chimpanzee is a primate in the same family as humans and are native to sub-Saharan Africa. While many chimpanzees are naturally hydrophobic, Sakamaki (1998) found that those in Mahale have been observed to submerge themselves into freshwater and eat algae.Sakamaki, T. (1998). First Record of Algae-Feeding by a Female Chimpanzee at Mahale This observation is the first documentation of a primate using algae in the wild as a food source and is an important marker of possible adaptation in the species. While the chimpanzee in question, Sally, was one of the only algae-eaters in her group, it was assumed that she had adopted this behaviour from her natal group prior to immigrating to this new environment. Nonetheless, this anecdotal field study highlights the act of eating algae in chimpanzees. Another example here is found in certain species of sheep. The North Ronaldsay sheep is native to the island of Orkney off of Scotland and had been bred for wool until recently being listed as a vulnerable population. This species relies heavily on tidal algae as outlined by Paterson and Coleman (1982).Paterson, I. W., & Coleman, C. D. (1982). Activity patterns of seaweed-eating sheep on North Ronaldsay, Orkney. Applied Animal Ethology, 8(1-2), 137-146. The researchers here observed the sheep feeding largely on brown algae, commonly known as seaweed. The sheep relied on the tides to expose the nutrient rich algae and when the tides made the food inaccessible, the sheep supported their diet with other forms of grazing. This feeding behaviour exemplifies the use of algophagy in this species of sheep. While algophagy has been viewed in both chimpanzees and sheep, it has also been observed in the common chicken as well. When the Poultry Department of the University of Maryland did an assay of dried Chlorella pyrenoidosa, they found it to be a rich nutrient source that could be substituted into the diet of chickens.Combs, G. F. (1952). Algae (Chlorella) as a source of nutrients for the chick. Science (Washington), 116, 453-454. The researcher behind this outlined the benefits of using this food replacement for chickens in that it improved growth and wellbeing of the chicken. While this example is not a natural one, it does outline the use of algae as a food source for domestic chickens, an important consideration in the future of both algophagy and agriculture.  Algophagy in humans (other vertebrates)  Spirulina tablets used for human consumption While this feeding behaviour is not commonly associated with human evolution or adaptation, it has gained some momentum in recent application. New dieting and food trends have veered towards the inclusion of spirulina into supplements. Spirulina is a blue-green algae that is used to supplement a variety of nutrients including essential proteins, vitamins, and minerals. In a past review of spirulina by Belay, Ota, Miyakawa, and Shimamatsu (1993), it was outlined that the algae could even be correlated to reduced risk of cholesterol problems, cancer, and heavy metal nephrotoxicity.Belay, A., Ota, Y., Miyakawa, K., & Shimamatsu, H. (1993). Current knowledge on potential health benefits of Spirulina. Journal of applied Phycology, 5(2), 235-241. Spirulina is relatively popular among dietary supplement enthusiasts and can be used in a varied of forms from capsules, to smoothies, to baked goods. This outlines a contemporary example of algophagy in humans that can help us appreciate the scope and breadth of algophagy in the animal kingdom See also *Glossary of entomology terms *Eating behaviour in Insects *Animal behaviour *Feeding behaviour References Eating behaviors ","title":"Algophagy"},{"id":"31207599","text":"The Ignace Deen Hospital (Hôpital Ignace Deen) is a hospital in Conakry, Guinea built during the colonial era. The hospital is situated next to the National Museum. A report in 2011 described the conditions as squalid, with poor quality of care. Since 2017, in collaboration with scientists from the United States and Denmark, Ignace Deen Hospital has acted as a regional hub of neurological research, Quality of care A travel guide describes the hospital as \\"not very reliable\\". A February 2011 report said the hospital had dilapidated infrastructure, poor sanitation, stifling heat, stench, lack of water and electricity, lack of drugs and maintenance. A bribe was required to gain admittance. There were few doctors. Wards were crowded, infested by bed bugs and mosquitoes. The toilets were clogged and there was an acute shortage of drinking water, which relatives of the patients were expected to supply. After a serious traffic accident killed two people and seriously injured three others in April 2008, the wounded were rushed to the hospital. There they waited for more than two hours without care, since the nursing staff had not been paid. This is common practice in Guinea, and many patients die due to non-payment before they receive emergency care. =Diseases= Polio vaccination in Conakry, 2009. Maternal mortality is high in Guinea due to lack of primary health care, poorly equipped obstetric wards in referral hospitals, untrained personnel and lack of health education. A 1991 study at the hospitals in Guinea found that the main causes of maternal death were abortion complications, which were linked with hypertension, and postpartum bleeding. A 1995 study at Ignace Deen found that anemia accounted for 65% of all maternal mortality. A study at the hospital showed high rates of sexually transmitted diseases among pregnant women including Candidosis (28.76%), Vaginal Trichomoniasis (13.88%), Chlamydia trachomatis (3.37%), HIV (2.38%), Syphilis (0.99%) and Gonococcus (0.40%). Over a five-year period, 41 cases of chronic pulmonary heart disease were observed at the hospital, representing 7.14% of hospitalized patients. The condition ranked 4th after hypertension, various myocardiopathies and valvulopathies. =Research= Since 2017, the Ignace Deen Hospital has been the primary site for several studies examining neurological health in low-income settings. Neurological research at Ignace Deen Hospital has focused on epilepsy and included investigations of traditional healing in the country, smartphone based diagnostic tools, school status and educational attainment, and autonomous delivery of antiepileptic drugs. These studies have found that epilepsy is a major burden for patients in Guinea. The majority of study participants have reported experiencing >100 seizures in their lifetimes, which falls within criteria for poorly controlled epilepsy. Critically, many patients are unable to access antiepileptic medications in a consistent manner. Additional findings include that traditional healing is nearly universally accessed prior to allopathic medicine and that epilepsy poses a particularly severe burden for children by hampering educational attainment.  Hospital history  The Ignace Deen Hospital, originally called the Hôpital Ballay, was built during the colonial era in the old town. The original name honored doctor Nöel Ballay, the first governor of Guinea in 1890 after it became separate from Senegal. The hospital was renamed following independence after a director in the Sékou Touré era, Ignace Deen. The Touré regime was ruthless in suppressing dissent. After the discovery of a coup attempt was announced in 1969, the 42-year-old surgeon- general of the hospital, Dr. Maréga Bocar, was condemned to a lifetime of forced labor. Between 1986 and 1988, a European project coordinated by the University of Liège rehabilitated the Ignace Deen Hospital. Without European funding, it could never have been rebuilt and re-equipped. It is one of the two National Hospitals with a reference laboratory, the other being Donka Hospital. Ignace Deen is also a university hospital (Centre Hospitalo Universitaire, or CHU), as is Donka, the only two in the country. =In the news= The hospital must periodically deal with the aftermath of political violence. A demonstration on Independence Day on 28 September 1993 was violently suppressed by troops. Official accounts said 18 people died and 198 were injured. Hospital records show 31 deaths, 21 at the Donka hospital and 10 at Ignace Deen, and 225 wounded. On Independence Day 2009, several thousand people staged a demonstration against the military rule of Captain Moussa Dadis Camara outside the Conakry Grand Mosque. It was reported that demonstrators were \\"trapped, brutalised, humiliated, beaten up, raped, stabbed and killed by drugged squads of the army\\". Authorities gave a death toll of 56, but human rights groups reported over 150. The bodies were taken to the morgue in the Ignace Deen Hospital, which was placed under military guard. An International Commission of Inquiry was established to investigate the violence, taking evidence from doctors at Ignace Deen who had given first aid and had heard the firsthand accounts of the victims. In October 2010, several supporters of the presidential candidate Alpha Condé were admitted to Ignace Deen hospital complaining that they had been poisoned by Fulani. Condé's wife, Mme Djene Kaba Condé, and other female leaders made a public visit to the victims, who appeared to be in considerable pain. The news caused violence in Upper Guinea, with people from Middle Guinea being killed or expelled and their property vandalized. When the hospital director Mme Hadja Fatoumata Binta Diallo said the Condé supporters were in no danger and no deaths had occurred, Prime Minister Jean Marie Doré suspended her for making speculative statements before a full medical analysis had been completed. After two weeks, the victims were visited by a team of traditional healers from Upper Guinea who performed gestures and incantations that caused them to immediately return to health. Binta Diallo was reinstated by the President later that month. Following Condé's election, in January 2011 Dr. Mohamed Awada was appointed director-general of the hospital. He replaced Dr Fatoumata Binta Diallo.

He played for just the 1974–75 season, one in which the Generals lost all 245 contests. Szolack became a favorite among the Globetrotters and was selected as the \\"unwitting\\" participant in many of their pre-determined entertainment plays. Early life and college Szolack was raised in Woodbury, New Jersey. He was described as \\"reed-thin\\" but was a \\"sniper\\" on the basketball court while playing for Woodbury High School, from which he graduated in 1968. His ability earned him all-conference and all-county honors, and Szolack then continued his career at Atlantic Cape Community College for two years. After community college, Szolack attended Glassboro State College (now called Rowan University), a then-NAIA school located in Glassboro, New Jersey. He was an integral player on the team, serving as one of their best substitutes off of the bench for head coach Jack Collins. In both seasons the team qualified for the national tournament. Szolack graduated from Glassboro State in the spring of 1973. Professional and later life Right after college, Szolack tried out for the Scranton Apollos in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, but he was the last cut and did not make the roster. He came upon the Washington Generals when he went to see the Globetrotters at the Spectrum in Philadelphia and obtained Red Klotz' phone number. Szolack spent the next year touring the world and playing against (losing to) the Globetrotters. They played seven days a week and sometimes played twice in a day. After his exhibition basketball career ended, he moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida and became a bartender. Then, his 54-year-old mother—with whom he was very close—died from a heart attack. He began to self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, and even admitted later to using up to $1,000 worth of cocaine per day for a time. From ages 27 through 34, Szolack's life was in ruins. In an interview, he later admitted, \\"Drugs turned me into a thief, a liar, a cheat ... One day I found myself sitting in a corner, holding a shotgun. I lived the life of a vampire, peeking out windows for hours at a time. Sometimes I had only enough energy to get from the bed to the sofa. I was sick, very sick. I didn't live ... I existed.\\" After not knowing where to turn, he made one last attempt for help by visiting his fiancée's mother. She gave him a hug; it was this hug that he claims turned his life around. He eventually dedicated his life to keeping children off of drugs and alcohol. He now goes by the nickname Al \\"Hugs Not Drugs\\" Szolack and serves as an abuse awareness director at Hammonton High School in Hammonton, New Jersey. He is also a motivational speaker and runs an annual basketball camp which he calls \\"Big Al's Basketball Camp.\\" Szolack travels across the United States giving speeches, many times at colleges and universities, and he is on the NCAA-approved speaker roster. Szolack is married to Carol Szolack; they have two daughters, Karolena and Olivia. As of 2011, they reside in Mullica Hill, New Jersey.

The Center was created for multidisciplinary scientific research, its proximity to certain colleges, its proximity to a local U.S. Air Force research facility, and was perceived as part of the nation's cold war effort. Johnson Space Center News. This article contains public domain information from a NASA document available online. NASA History Program Office. He was an American electrical engineer, researcher, and musician. Kock was also a novelist under the pseudonym Wayne Kirk. Kock also wrote books about topics in engineering and acoustics. These included radar, sonar, holography, and lasers. List of science books authored by KocK at the Library of Congress *The first line of this paragraph is copied almost word for word from the German Wikipedia article of the same name (translated into English). Kock's seminal research in artificial dielectrics, carried out at AT&T; Bell Laboratories in the 1940s, is a historical connection to metamaterials. Education At age four Kock started learning piano, and by high school he could play full recitals. In college he began composing music. He then took electrical engineering courses at the University of Cincinnati and continued studying piano and organ at the Cincinnati College of Music. In the 1930s, as partial fulfillment of his bachelor's degree, he built an electronic organ. He used the more economical neon glow tubes for his electronic organ rather than radio vacuum tubes as sources for tones. In 1932 he received his BSc degree in electrical engineering. For his master's degree thesis Kock grappled with the problem of pitch stabilization for 70 neon tubes in an electronic organ. In 1933 he received his Master of Science degree. In 1934, he received his Ph.D. in experimental and theoretical physics from the University of Berlin. His examiners were Professors Max von Laue and Arthur Wehnelt. As part of the thesis, Kock, together with another candidate, developed an improved design for an electronic organ based on the formant principle. Free PDF download. Career Kock was a researcher for Bell Laboratories. Part of his work there involved artificial dielectrics. He proposed metallic and wire lenses for antennas. Some of these are the metallic delay lens, parallel-wire lens, and the wire mesh lens. In addition, he conducted analytical studies regarding the response of customized metallic particles to a quasistatic, electromagnetic radiation field. Kock noted behaviors and structure in these artificial materials. In one journal, entitled Proceedings of the IRE (see ref below), Kock describes a new type of antenna applying the optical properties of Radio waves. It is in fact a metallic lens, which focuses electromagnetic waves \\"...from short waves up to wavelengths of perhaps five meters or more.\\" Before becoming Director of NASA Electronics Research Center he was vice- president research of the Bendix Corp., Detroit. After leaving the Director's position, he returned to Bendix as vice-president and chief scientist. He continued at NASA as a member of the Administration Committee. Research He continued work in electronic music engineering from the age of electronic tubes all the way to the invention of the transistor. He also researched holography, gamma rays, semiconductors, picture phone and artificial dielectrics. His work in artificial dielectrics preceded metamaterials by approximately 50 years.

Alec Bradley is the name of a popular brand of handmade cigars established in 1996 by Alan Rubin, the son of an importer of hardware supplies. Rubin launched his brand, named after his children, at the tail end of the cigar boom of the 1990s and entered a clogged market. After failed initial schemes at producing cigars targeted to golf courses and flavored after-dinner cigars, Rubin managed to carve out a tenuous niche selling budget-priced cigars to tobacconists. In 2007 the company managed to break through to a broader market with the introduction of its full-flavored \\"Tempus\\" line. As of 2011 the company was selling between two and three million cigars annually to consumers around the world. Company history =Establishment= Alan Rubin (born circa 1961) is the son of a hardware importer who ran a Florida-based company called the All Points Screw Company, specializing in sales to manufacturers of cabinetry. Alan entered the business immediately after finishing college and helped the firm change its emphasis to the sale of hurricane fasteners, a booming business in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. In 1996 the prosperous hardware concern was sold and Rubin used part of his proceeds from the sale to seriously launch the new cigar company he had envisioned and incorporated shortly before.\\"The Man Who Moves Time: Alan Rubin,\\" Smoke magazine, vol. 14, no. 1 (Winter 2008/09). The new company was named Alec Bradley after Rubin's children. Rubin attended the 1996 Retail Tobacco Dealers of America trade show and eventually found a small manufacturer in Honduras who agreed to make cigars for him. Rubin later recalled the relationship was one-sided and costly. \\"It didn't work out very well,\\" he said in a January 2011 interview with Cigar Aficionado magazine. \\"He was taking my money and not giving me product.\\" The first cigars by Alec Bradley were known as \\"Bogey's Stogies\\" and were designed to be sold through golf pro shops for golfers to smoke on the course. Manufactured from 1997 to 1999 — the deepest years of the \\"cigar bust\\" which followed the faddish cigar boom of the 1990s — Bogey's Stogies proved an unprofitable venture. By the spring of 1999, Rubin found himself approximately $60,000 in debt and facing failure of his venture. =The turnaround= In 2000, Rubin hooked up with cigar industry professional Ralph Montero, who came to work for Alec Bradley and was instrumental in shifting its direction. Rubin and Montero were convinced that they needed to gain space in the retail shops of specialty tobacco sellers and managed to scrape together enough money to launch a new product line called \\"Occidental Reserve,\\" using Henke Kelner, a maker of cigars for the cigar brand Davidoff. Some 500 sample packs of the new cigars were prepared and mailed out to retail shops, which were followed up with phone calls soliciting business. About 300 new customers were won for the company with this last-ditch gambit, according to Rubin. The company followed up its low price Occidental Reserve line with a new triangular cigar called the \\"Trilogy.\\" The unusual new cigar shape was both an attempt to lure consumers with a fresh-looking new product and an attempt to replicate the feel of a 46 ring cigar in the hand with a more weighty 50 ring product. Rubin remembered: > \\"...I didn’t really love box-press or the semi-presado, I didn’t really like > that feel, so I went to Home Depot, and they happened to be demo-ing a > DeWalt table saw, and I asked the guy, 'Does this thing cut angles?' he > said, 'Yeah,' and I said, 'I’ll be right back.' I went out and I bought > wood, I had him cut it on angles, and I bought some wood glue, and I made > molds. I used a hand-vice that we had in the back of the office, and I > started pressing cigars in a triangular shape. > > \\"I made a V-shaped mold with an open top, and I used a flat top on it. > That’s how we started to press them. When everyone would leave the office, > I’d put two in there, and the next morning, I’d come in and take them out. > It was hard to convince people here that it was what we should do, but once > they started smoking it, they realized that it was really comfortable in > their mouth and in their hand, and they embraced it.\\" Rubin followed up his triangular cigar in 2005 with another new line, this time a stout 50 ring gauge called \\"Maxx.\\" Both of these new releases were well received in the industry, helping the struggling company to survive. In 2007, Alec Bradley achieved its greatest success to date with the introduction of a new full-bodied line called \\"Tempus.\\" Rubin later recalled: > \\"Every cigar that we did prior to Tempus was mild, mild-to-medium, or > medium. Tempus gave us a more full-bodied cigar, a little more strength, a > high level of satisfaction in the flavor profile. It was really the next > level of cigar for us. Alec Bradley became the [official] brand with Tempus. > We felt the cigar warranted it.\\" The new Tempus line was produced by the Fabrica de Tabacos Raices Cubana factory of Danlí, Honduras, known for the manufacture of Cuban-style cigars with triple-capped heads. A special Trojes tobacco from the Jalapa Valley of Nicaragua was used for the product, which met with critical success from cigar connoisseurs. =Company today= Alec Bradley is today based in Dania Beach, Florida. The company sells between two and three million cigars each year.

The game was released in two parts: Tales of Bearsworth Manor: Puzzling Pages, and Tales of Bearsworth Manor: Chaotic Conflicts. Both games are set in a picture book held by a ghost in the haunted Bearsworth Manor, and have the player use the Wiimote controller to toss paper bears onto the book's 3D landscape. Chaotic Conflicts is a tower defense game, where the paper bears defend blue gems from enemy BadBears, while Puzzling Pages is a puzzle game where the bears collect red candies. Both game versions received poor reviews; critics felt that the games were amusing and creative, but found the controls terrible. Gameplay Gameplay from Chaotic Conflicts, with two gems being defended In Puzzling Pages, players use the Wii Remote to throw paper bears into the landscape of a picture book on the screen to manipulate the on screen environment in order to gather all the red candies. There are no enemies to combat in this version, only puzzles to solve. Bears pick up red candies when they end up near them, and the level ends when all candies are picked up. Some levels feature the ability to throw items, such as bombs, in addition to the bears. Players must blow up boxes with bombs, land their bears on see-saws, and activate switches in order to collect the red candies. \\"Puzzling Pages\\" features 30 levels. At the end of each level, the player is awarded a medal depending on how many bears they still have left unused. In Chaotic Conflicts, players use the Wiimote to throw paper bears into a picture book landscape, similar to the other game. The goal is to protect blue gems in a tower defense-style game. The bears act as soldiers to fight off waves of enemies, known as BadBears, from reaching the blue gems, which hang over spots in the landscape. Each gem can take a certain number of strikes from enemies before breaking, and losing any of the gems ends the level. Some levels feature ledges and other surfaces that the player must aim their bears towards. Levels can also include special items, which are picked up by bears and then thrown by the player to have various effects like extra damage on certain types of BadBears. There are also special units which can be picked up, such as penguins that freeze enemies and jack o' lanterns that blow them up. In addition to the base game, downloadable content is available for sale for both games. Extra levels and character designs are available, with the price of all the DLC reaching around double the price of the base games, upon release. Plot Both games are set in a crumbling, haunted mansion, named Bearsworth Manor. The eponymous tales are two books in the manor; one held by the young girl ghost Pina, and one by the you boy ghost Kina. Pina's picture book comes to life in Puzzling Pages, transforming into a 3D landscape, and the player solves the puzzles inside by sending paper bears into the book, where they collect candies. In Chaotic Conflicts, players send paper bears into Kina's book, which has also transformed into a 3D landscape, to defend their blue gems from Kina. Reception IGN reviewed both games and gave them a 5.5, or \\"Mediocre\\", calling the graphical style \\"sensational\\", but panning both games imprecise controls, short game play time, and excessive price for the games and their downloadable content. Nintendo Life was complimentary of Puzzling Pages, calling it a \\"creative storybook adventure\\" wrapped around a simple game and awarding it 8 of 10, while Edge magazine gave it a 4, saying that \\"its concept feels almost thrown together\\". Nintendo Life also gave Chaotic Chronicles an 8 of 10, praising the \\"silly theme and intense gameplay mechanics\\", but Edge gave it a 3, claiming that the poor controls left the game almost unplayable. Nintendo Gamer reviewed Puzzling Pages higher than Chaotic Conflicts; they felt that the game format suited the puzzle genre more than the tower defense genre, but that both games were marred by poor controls.

Rice was educated in the public schools in Massachusetts and apprenticed as a shoemaker in Marlborough, Massachusetts until he reached 21 years of age. Rice married Emma Louise Cunningham of Marlborough on 25 October 1860, and they had four children. From 1861 to 1864 he served in the Union Army as a second lieutenant in Company E, 5th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, serving in Baltimore, Washington D.C. and North Carolina. Between 1865 and 1866, he served as a sales agent to the U.S. military for the L.T. Jefts shoe manufacturer in Marlborough. Business career Print advertisement from Rice & Hutchins, Inc. 1907 In October, 1866 Rice and his partner and neighbor from Hudson, Massachusetts Horatio H. Hutchins began the Rice and Hutchins Shoe Company with sales offices in Boston, Massachusetts, and a factory in Marlborough, Massachusetts. By the time of the company's founding, Marlborough had built a reputation in shoe and boot making to supply the Union Army during the American Civil War. In the first twenty years of the company, Rice and Hutchins established shoe factories in Warren, Maine and Rockland, Massachusetts, four factories in Marlboro, Massachusetts, a factory in Boston, and their first wholesale distribution warehouse outside New England in Philadelphia. After Hutchins retired from the company in 1885, Rice led the further expansion of the company by adding more factories in Quincy, Braintree, and Yonkers, New York. He also expanded the distribution capability of the company by opening wholesale houses in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Atlanta, and Chicago. He also was responsible for developing international sales by establishing offices in London, Berlin, and Manila. He led the initial incorporation of the company in 1892 under the laws of New Jersey, and later the reorganization and incorporation of the company in Maine in 1905. At the time of Rice's death on 21 May 1909, the company was among the largest shoe manufacturers in the United States. During his career Rice was engaged in a number of civic and philanthropic pursuits. In 1894, Governor Frederic T. Greenhalge appointed him to the governor's council of business advisers and he was a major benefactor of the Quincy City Hospital.

Poetic verses with philosophy and hidden nuances form the core farmanns or upaya (remedy recommended) of the book.It is believed to have Persian origins and has led to field of remedial astrology known as Lal Kitab remedies, that is simple remedies for various planetary afflictions in the horoscope or birth chart, which have over the years become part of the folk traditions of the region, that includes North India and Pakistan.Mahajan, p. 7. - . Authorship & the practitioners of today Although, the author of the original verses is unknown or a matter of debate, however, Pandit Roop Chand Joshi (1898-1982) of Punjab, who authored the presently available version during the years 1939 to 1952 in five volumes, is regarded as the master of this science.Vol. 3, Lal Kitab, 1941 Some regard him also as originator of this books or The names of the five set of books authored by Pt. Roop Chand Joshi, together called as Lal Kitab with their years of publication, are as follows. A copy of first book published in 1939 is preserved in Lahore Museum. :- # Lal Kitab Ke Farman (The Edicts of Lal Kitab), 1939, 383 pages # Lal Kitab Ke Arman (Ilm Samudrik Kee Lal Kitab Ke Armaan), (The “Aspirations” of Lal Kitab), 1940, 280 pages # Gutka (Ilm Samudrik Kee Lal Kitab) (Third Part), 1941, 428 pages # Lal Kitab Ke Farman (Lal Kitab – Tarmeem Shuda), 1942, 384 pages # Ilm-e Samudrik ki buniyad par ki Lalkitab (Lal Kitab), 1952, 1173 pages Contents Lal Kitab is unique in field of vedic astrology because for the first time a book explained how certain planetary positions in one's horoscope should also reflect in the lines of his palm. In other word the book is on astro- palmistry, that is, it has mixed the two different arts of Palmistry and Jyotisha a.k.a. Hindu astrology together. The books were published in red hard-cover. In Hindi and Urdu languages Lal means the color red and Kitab means a book. Further, in India traditionally, business ledger books are bound in red color. Also red color in Hindu religion is considered to be very auspicious and as symbol of Ganesha and Lakshmi. The red kum-kum is essential in all auspicious occasion and Hindu religious rites. The Lal Kitab volumes were also given a red binding because these books contain duniyavi hisaab kitaab ( the ledger book of one’s life). In fact, Lal Kitab mandates in very clear terms, that any book dealing with this system must be bound in non- shining, red color. For the first time in the history of astrology, Lal Kitab introduced a new style of horoscope analysis with quick and affordable remedies, which were devoid of remedies like pooja and wearing of gemstones, generally recommended by other branches of Vedic astrology and Jyotisha. In present days, there are many followers of Lal Kitab. In India and abroad one can find many practitioners of Lal Kitab, prescribing remedies as per farmanns of these books. There are many people, who claim to have benefited from the remedies of these books. The mass followers of Lal Kitab are increasing everyday and this science has become very popular in present days throughout different parts of world. The book has been popular in both Indian and Pakistan, many of its astrological remedies upaya or farmans have become part of every day culture in the subcontinent, like throwing coins into a river while passing over it, feeding grass to cow, bread to a dog and offering meals to unmarried girls etc. Cultural influences The book has been popular in both Indian and Pakistan, many of its astrological remedies upaya or farmans have become part of every day culture in the subcontinent, like throwing coins into a river while passing over it, feeding grass to cow, bread to a dog and offering meals to unmarried girls etc.Shrimali, p. 9 Some of its farmans have become proverbs, in languages as diverse as Multani language.

Digital steganography can hide confidential data (i.e. secret files) very securely by embedding them into some media data called \\"vessel data.\\" The vessel data is also referred to as \\"carrier, cover, or dummy data\\". In BPCS-steganography true color images (i.e., 24-bit color images) are mostly used for vessel data. The embedding operation in practice is to replace the \\"complex areas\\" on the bit planes of the vessel image with the confidential data. The most important aspect of BPCS-steganography is that the embedding capacity is very large. In comparison to simple image based steganography which uses solely the least important bit of data, and thus (for a 24-bit color image) can only embed data equivalent to 1/8 of the total size, BPCS-steganography uses multiple bit-planes, and so can embed a much higher amount of data, though this is dependent on the individual image. For a 'normal' image, roughly 50% of the data might be replaceable with secret data before image degradation becomes apparent. Principle of embedding The Human visual system has such a special property that a too-complicated visual pattern can not be perceived as \\"shape-informative.\\" For example, on a very flat beach shore every single square-foot area looks the same - it is just a sandy area, no shape is observed. However, if you look carefully, two same- looking areas are entirely different in their sand particle shapes. BPCS- steganography makes use of this property. It replaces complex areas on the bit-planes of the vessel image with other complex data patterns (i.e., pieces of secret files). This replacing operation is called \\"embedding.\\" No one can see any difference between the two vessel images of before and after the embedding operation. An issue arises where the data to be embedded appears visually as simple information, if this simple information replaces the complex information in the original image it may create spurious 'real image information'. In this case the data is passed through a [binary image conjugation transformation], in order to create a reciprocal complex representation. Present status of research and development This form of steganography was proposed jointly by Eiji Kawaguchi and Richard O. Eason in 1998. Their experimental program (titled Qtech Hide & View) is freely available for educational purposes. Recently, many researchers are tackling its algorithm improvement and applications as well as resistibility studies against steganalysis.

Regular staples of the paper include a \\"Cadet in Focus\\" feature in which a selected senior from the corps is interviewed and given a short biographical article, an editorials page that focuses on U.S. or Virginia politics and issues relating to the corps, a sports section that exclusively covers VMI NCAA sports, an event page with annual and special events, and a humor page. The humor page is featured on the back of the final page every week and is made up of content exclusively submitted by members of the VMI corps. Significant expansion in terms of staff, circulation and content, and reformatting was planned for the 2011-2012 cycle. There were also preliminary plans for an expanded weekly online version of the paper, which will probably not be realized until late 2011 or early 2012.

Shortly after their arrival in Durban, Marshall's father was awarded a contract to construct the harbour's North Pier. This enabled him to buy land on the Umdhloti River, and develop his farm which he called Muckleneuk, Scots for 'great bend'. The house was designed by Frank Fleming, one of Herbert Baker's partners. By the time he died in 1865 aged 44, he had become a prominent sugar cane planter and miller. Marshall also turned to sugar cane farming and in 1895 founded Natal Estates Limited , and two years later South Africa's first sugar refinery. He married Ellen Blamey, daughter of another sugar pioneer, in 1877 and settled at Mount Edgecombe, raising a family of four children. Being active in local business and politics, he became a member of the Natal Legislative Council, later being appointed Senator for Natal. In 1915 he received a knighthood for services to the country. A Black township outside Durban is named Kwa Mashu, Zulu for 'the place of Marshall'. Of interest is that he played a part in 1892 in introducing rickshaws to Durban, a mode of transport that has become very popular with sight-seeing tourists.

Together with the Wendelstein Cable Car (Wendelstein-Seilbahn) it is operated by the Wendelsteinbahn GmbH. The mountain railway climbs through a total height of . The Wendelstein Railway is one of only four working rack railways in Germany, the others being the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway, the Drachenfels Railway and the Stuttgart Rack Railway.  Conception  The construction of the Wendelstein Railway was the vision of privy councillor (Geheimer Kommerzienrat), Dr. h.c. Otto von Steinbeis, an industrialist, who was involved in forestry and agriculture in the alpine foreland as well as logging in Bosnia on a grand scale and built, in parallel with that, an extensive light railway (Kleinbahn) network. In 1908 he published his plans and on 4 February 1910 Prince-Regent Luitpold signed the concession deed for the construction of the Wendelstein Rack Railway. The original long route, running from Brannenburg over the eastern flank of the mountain, has seven tunnels, eight galleries and twelve bridges. In order to keep services running even in winter a route along the steep rock faces of the Wildalpjoch and the Soin was chosen instead of the cheaper and easier route on the slopes of the Mitteralm and Reindleralm alpine meadows.  Construction  Construction began on 29 March 1910 after a certain amount of opposition and various difficulties had been overcome. The cost of construction came to about three million gold marks, which was entirely borne by von Steinbeis. Over the two years that the line took to build, around 800 workers were employed, predominantly from Bosnia and Hercegovina and Italy. The task was demanding. For the so-called Hohe Mauer (\\"High Wall\\") alone, a long, high embankment was built just before the mountain station, requiring of rock to be removed. A total of of explosive were used. The first train worked the line on 12 May 1912 and, on 25 May, the railways was formally opened. The Wendelstein Rack Railway is thus the oldest, working rack railway in Bavaria.The first rack railway in Bavaria was the industrial railway to the paper factory in Kinsau am Lech built in 1906; It was closed however during the 1920s. The oldest still working rack railway in Germany is the Drachenfels Railway which opened on 13 July 1883.  Operation  Loco No. 1 with trailer car 3 in Lokwelt Freilassing The full journey on the original route took 75 minutes. In 1961, as a result of the growth in private car ownership, the section between Brannenburg station and the present valley station in the village of Waching was sacrificed because it crossed the federal road. At the same time the railway lost its connexion to the Deutsche Bundesbahn network. As a result, the length of the line was reduced to and journey times to 55 minutes. In the years that followed it became clear that the line could not be operated profitably. As a result, in 1970, the Wendelstein Cable Car was erected running from Bayrischzell-Osterhofen to the Wendelstein summit, with the intent that it would replace the rack railway in due course. The attraction of the rack railway for tourism was however recognised and it was kept going. In 1987, with help from the Free State of Bavaria, the local parishes, the district of Rosenheim and the parent company of Lechwerke, the line was modernised at a cost of 17 million deutschmarks. On conclusion of the work in 1991 the capacity of the line increased by almost 100%. Journey times were reduced to 25 minutes uphill and 35 minutes downhill, thanks to two modern double railcars. The trains are able to operate every half an hour. Today 20 employees work on the rack railway, but it is still reliant on equalization payments.

Næsheim was born and grew up in Stavanger. He moved to Oslo in 1945, where he was employed as an illustrator for the Aftenposten newspaper until retiring in 1995. He also illustrated the sports section of the Dagbladet newspaper between 1968 and 1981, as well as having shorter contracts with Stavanger Aftenblad and Jærbladet. He was educated at Statens håndverks- og kunstindustriskole in Oslo 1945-50, Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris 1947 and Goldsmith's College of Art in London 1951. His debut as a graphics artist was in 1948, and he held his first separate exhibition in 1985 at Hå old priestyard in 1985. His father was the painter Sverre Næsheim (1900–76).

Curriculum vitae Rofé was born in Pisa, Italy in 1932. His father, Gersh Roifer was active in the Zionist movement and directed the maritime school of the Betar movement in Civitavecchia. His mother, Matilde Gallichi, taught classics at high school; she was descended from a family that had lived in Tuscany for generations. Before his death in August 1938, Gersh Roifer directed his wife to make Aliyah (immigration to the Land of Israel) with the children. In the fall of 1939 the family settled in the Land of Israel. Rofe' attended schools in various places in this country and graduated from the Ohel Shem high school in Ramat Gan. At the Hebrew University he studied Hebrew Bible and the History of Israel. His teachers in Bible were M.D. Cassuto, Y. Kaufmann, I.L. Seeligmann, S. Talmon, M. Weiss, M. Haran, S.E. Loewenstamm; in History of Israel – B. Mazar, A. Malamat, A. Shalit; in Assyriology – H. Tadmor, in Hebrew Language – N. H. Tur-Sinai, E.Y. Kutscher, Ben-Haim, S. Morag; in History of Religions – D. Flusser, R.J.Z. Werblowsky. Rofe' wrote his dissertation under the supervision of I.L. Seeligmann, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1970. Since 1959, Rofé has taught in the following academic institutions: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Haifa University, University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (Beer Sheva), Yale University (New Haven, CT), Università degli Studi di Firenze (Italy), The Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, The Humanistic University in Moscow, Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati (Ohio), Pontificio Istituto Biblico (Rome, Italy), Studium Biblicum Franciscanum (Jerusalem), University of São Paulo (Brazil), Ariel University Center of Samaria, Facoltà Teologica di Sicilia (Palermo, Italy). In addition he offered guest lectures in the following universities: Rome, Pisa, Turin, The Catholic University in Milan, Venice, Catania (Sicily), Sorbon (Paris), Marburg, Göttingen, Tübingen (Germany), Columbia (New York), Brandeis (Waltham, MA), Bloomington (Indiana). Rofé taught at the Hebrew University for nearly forty years. He was promoted to full professorship in 1986 and retired in 2000. He had served twice as head of the Department of Bible. He co-edited the series of monographs Jerusalem Bible Studies between the years 1979-1986 and has been editor and coeditor of Textus, Studies of the Hebrew University Bible Project, between the years 1995–2009. Rofé married Esther Kessler in 1954. They have four children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. Research Rofé has contributed to three fields of study in the Hebrew Bible: textual criticism, history of literature, and history of the Israelite religion. In his research he strives to integrate these fields, because each one of them is advanced by perceptions obtained in the other two. 1. His first book, The Israelite Belief in Angels (Ph.D. dissertation, 1969, Hebrew, published 1979 ) hypothesizes that the Hebrew belief in angels was an attempt at fitting ancient polytheistic traditions into the frame of a monotheistic faith. He suggests that the Hebrew term \\"the destroying angel\\" actually refers to the Canaanite god Reshep, and that the site of Bethel (which is Hebrew for \\"house of God\\") actually deals with a pagan god, who he claims is present in extra- biblical sources. This was one of the aspects of the ancient biblical angelology in pre-exilic times. He suggests that the Septuagint, in Gen 32: 2-3 and Deut 32: 8-9, 43, provides evidence of this possible change in Hebrew paradigms. If true, he claims that such a polytheistic origin of the belief in angels could explain why passages of Scripture attributed to D and P (two proposed partial content sources for the Pentateuch) silence all mentions of angels. Both Qoheleth and the Sadducees later developed an aversion to believing in angels; however, by that time, a full-fledged angelology was developing amidst apocalyptic circles. 2a. The Religion of Ancient Israel and the Text of the Hebrew Bible. Over the years, Rofé has dedicated quite a few articles to the question of how far the development of the Israelite religion affected the transmission of the Biblical text. In the wake of scholars such as A. Geiger and I.L. Seeligmann, Rofé suggested that textual corrections due to the following tenets may have taken place: (1) the unification of worship in Jerusalem (2) enhancing the observance of the Torah (3) obliteration of the epithet SEBA'OT from God's name (4) rejection of pillars as cultic objects (5) negation of the possibility that God hates Israel (6) deference to Israel's dignitaries and aversion to the wicked. The study of these corrections contributes to understanding the beliefs of the scribes that transmitted the Biblical books in the first generations after their composition. 2b. Another aspect of textual criticism is its contact with the history of Biblical literature. Rofé emphasized that these two realms are interdependent. Thus he argued, on the basis of literary-stylistic considerations, that in Deuteronomy 5 the shorter text presented by the tefillin from Qumran should be preferred over against all other textual witnesses. In Joshua 20, arguments derived from higher criticism (i.e., the discipline that defines and dates sundry documents in the Biblical books) proved the superiority of the shorter text witnessed by the Septuagint. Contrariwise, in Judges 6 Rofé opines that the Massoretic Text (=MT) has the precedence while the Qumran manuscript 4QJudg erroneously skipped vss. 7-10; this too is inferred from the 19th century higher criticism that identified an ancient Elohistic redaction in the Book of Judges. 2c. In the study of the Biblical text there are no rigid rules. Rofé maintains that the scribes who first copied the inherited works were rather sophisticated. At times, indeed, they piled additions upon their texts, but otherwise they abridged their documents on literary or ideological grounds. In the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17), there are linguistic and literary arguments for the precedence of the MT over against the shorter one represented by the Septuagint (=LXX). In the book of Jeremiah the situation is more complex: sometimes the shorter text, represented by the LXX, can be considered as a kind of 'first edition', but more often the shorter text derived from editorial interventions of late scribes, who operated according to their literary and theological conceptions. On these issues Rofé differed from the views of his colleague Emanuel Tov. 2d. The study of theological views in the Bible led Rofé to the identification of secondary, midrashic elements in the textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible. These elements are evident in short glosses, appended to Exodus 2: 3 in a Qumran scroll, 1 Kings 22:28 in the MT and Ruth 4: 11 in the LXX. But in addition Rofé pointed out midrashic elaborations that affected a whole biblical book. This is the case of the Qumran scroll 4Q51, usually designated as 4QSama. Rofé highlighted the various midrashic elements in this manuscript and thereby inferred that one should not define this scroll as representing the book of Samuel; rather it is an ancient Midrash Samuel. Here Rofé differed with F.M. Cross and his students from the Harvard School. 3. The Documentary Hypothesis and the Composition of the Pentateuch. A study of the religious thought in the Torah entails taking a stand vis-à-vis the Documentary Hypothesis. This happened to Rofé in his study of the belief in angels. In his opinion, there is no reason to contest the existence of the major documents in the Pentateuch – D, produced by the Deuteronomic writers, and P, created in the Priestly school. However, the bulk of the narrative material cannot be subdivided as usual between the four putative documents, J, E, D, P. An instructive case in point is the story of Balaam in Numbers 22: 2 – 24: 25. He proposed that the story was not composed by the fusion of the accounts of the documents J and E. Rather, he claims that the story of Balaam was based on a legend that grew up gradually and organically. He hypothesized that the speeches of Numbers 24 which presented Balaam as one \\"who knows the knowledge of the Most High\\" actually were written first, and the incident involving an angel, Balaam, and his donkey (Numbers 22: 22-35) came later. Also, a study of the Betrothal of Rebekkah (Genesis 24) led him to similar conclusions: he claims that the story is not part of the hypothetical document J, but an independent piece; it is a paradigm composed in post-exilic times in order to teach the people of Judea the proper choice in match-making. See below, at paragraph 6, for further stories of this kind. 4a. The Prophetical Stories: The Narratives about the Prophets in the Hebrew Bible – Their Literary Types and History (Hebrew: 1982, 1986; English: 1988). In the ten chapters of this book Rofé summarized eighteen years of study, between 1964 and 1982. This is a first effort in Biblical research to present a comprehensive description of all the stories about the prophets, defining their genres, such as legend, biography, historiography, parables, and determining the origin of the genres and their subsequent development. The legenda, for instance, came into being among the admirers of Elisha, around the end of the 9th century BCE. The parable appeared when the disciples of the prophets began to discuss the nature of the prophets' mission and of the word of the Lord pronounced by them. This genre was probably created in late pre- exilic and early post-exilic times. The climax of the prophetical stories is the epopee about Elijah and the Lord's fight against Baal. In its last phases, the prophetical narrative described its heroes as martyrs who taught foreigners the omnipotence of the god of Israel. 4b. The theological discussion about the essence of prophecy. The quality of the word of the Lord engaged the disciples of the prophets for a long time in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Is the word of the Lord always fulfilled? The question was raised and received a positive answer in an addition to the law concerning prophecy in Deut 18: 21-22. The same view transpires from the Deuteronomistic redaction of the book of Kings and is proclaimed by Deutero-Isaiah. The opposite stand was taken by the author of Jonah, by the Deuteronomistic editor of Jeremiah, and an editor of Ezekiel (Ch. 33). Trito-Isaiah joined them while contesting the views of his master, Deutero-Isaiah. The identification of this divergence led Rofé to define anew the border between the words of Deutero-and Trito-Isaiah. To the former one should attribute chs. 40-53, to the latter – chs. 54-66. Indeed, Abraham Kuenen suggested this as early as 1886. 5. The Introduction to Deuteronomy: Part I and Further Chapters (Hebrew: 1988) grew out of notes distributed to students of Bible at the Hebrew University in the wake of the Yom Kippur war (1973), because of the teacher's and the students' absence from classes. This Introduction attempts at describing the contents of Deuteronomy and its structure which mainly consists of two covenants: Horeb (4:44 - 28:68 + 30: 1 - 10) and the one in the Land of Moab (28: 69 – 30: 20). The latter covenant has a clear affinity to vassal treaties, mainly Hittite, of the Second Millennium BCE. Rofés enquiry, however, is principally not comparative, but internal; it seeks to uncover the history of Deuteronomy, especially its legal corpus, by dwelling on its duplications and contradictions. Thus the various layers have been exposed: first, prae- Deuteronomic inherited material, then Deuteronomic legislation that preceded the Josiah reform of 622 BCE, further an additional, later layer from the time of the reform itself, finally a post-reform layer that supplemented and interpreted the earlier legislation. This kind of work reached into post- exilic times. Rofés study confirms the conclusion, already expressed by former scholars, that the ultimate origin of the Deuteronomic movement was in the ancient holy site of Shechem, probably in the 10th century BCE. A significant portion of this research has been published in English: Deuteronomy: Issues and Interpretation (Edinburgh 2002). 6. The Introduction to the Literature of the Hebrew Bible (Hebrew: 2006, 2007; English: 2009). As usual in books of introduction, this work does not strive for innovations, but attempts at describing the problems brought to light by the discipline and the methods applied to solve them. The particular merit of this Introduction is that it does not merely present the conclusions reached by the Biblical research, but it shows the course that led to them. For instance, Part 3 \\"The Prophetic Literature\\" poses some fundamental questions: Did the disciples of the prophets introduce additions into the words of their masters? Did they rework them? What are the proofs to their interventions? How can one distinguish between prophecy and apocalyptic? Part 4, \\"Psalmody\\", not only summarized the method of Hermann Gunkel, but also criticized it; the same was done with his main detractor, Meir Weiss. A peculiarity of this introduction is its chapter \\"Late Narrative\\" (Part I, Chapter 4). Here Rofé brought together findings from his previous studies. Signs of late composition clearly indicate that the stories about the betrothal of Rebekkah (Genesis 24), the rape of Dinah (Genesis 34), David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17), the wars with Aram (1 Kings 20), the vineyard of Naboth (1 Kings 21: 1-16) were all written in post-exilic times. They reflect problems and expectations of the people of Yehud in Persian times. These findings run against the Documentary Hypothesis in the Pentateuch and the hypothesis of a single Deuteronomistic composition from Deuteronomy 1 to 2 Kings 25. The creation of the Biblical literature was a multifarious process that extended over a longer span than the one usually accepted in Biblical criticism.

Business model The company works both nationally and internationally, where they have established factories and sales companies . The company's two main areas are Telecommunications and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC). Within the Telecom business unit, the company is a supplier of cooling solutions for the Telecom networks suppliers and network operators. Within the HVAC business unit, there are several branches: defense, dehumidification, swimming pool ventilation, and residential ventilation. The total sale for the Dantherm group represents 464.6 million Danish krone (DKK). (2010), while the number of employees is approximately 537. The company's profit before tax represented a deficit of 44.5 million DKK, (improving over the previous years, when two entries were negative 96.5 million DKK and 293.1 million DKK). In 2011 they expected an operating profit (EBIT) of 20-25 million DKK, a small profit before tax and a turnover of 500-550 million DKK. The headquarters of the Dantherm Group is located in Skive.  History  In 1958 E.R. Olsen founded his works under the name Danterm, which was changed to Dantherm. The increase in industrial production was the main force in the 1950s' economic development, which in a few years abolished the high unemployment seen in the Skive region. This meant that many industrial factories were built, and all needed to be heated and therefore could potentially use fan heaters that Eilert meant to develop. In the 1960s the company became a Publicly traded Aktieselskab and sales organizations were created in Norway, Germany, France and England. In 1973, the company was divided into Dantherm AS as a production company and Dantherm Trading AS, which would handle the negotiation of company products on the Danish market. Eilert was always looking for new opportunities, which resulted in his development, in the late 1970s, of a dehumidifier in cooperation with low power engineer Svend Thøgersen. The dehumidifier was patented and put into production in 1977-88. It was named CD (Condense Dryer). Dehumidifiers are now one of Dantherm's main areas. In the 1980s—after the 1970s energy crisis—much was done in Denmark to be energy efficient. The company developed a cross flow heat exchanger that could regain the warm air in the building to heat the fresh cool air while ventilating, instead of discharging heat out of the window. Svend Thøgersen founded in 1983 Stelectric, which started supplying electronics control systems for them. In the mid 1980s Dantherm Norway developed mobile refrigeration and heating equipment for the armed forces and NATO. In the 1990s they ventured into electronics cooling, with telecommunications network as their main marketing area. In 1996 the company established a production facility in Spartanburg, United States and in 2001 in Suzhou, China. In 2018 Troy Berg of Dane Manufacturing, a US based firm, purchased the US telecom division of Dantherm, forming Dantherm Cooling. www.danthermcooling.com References Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ","title":"Dantherm"},{"id":"31208984","text":"Julurpad or Julurpadu is a mandal in Bhadradri Kothagudem district, Telangana, India.

The laboratory was never built. In 2001 the Public Prosecutor's Office of Tarnobrzeg started a criminal investigation in the case of extortion of money to obtain credit to build the laboratory. Investment The investment was supposed to create a facility for fractionation of blood plasma and production of different blood-related medical products. The investment was meant to be lucrative. It appeared also that it would materialize WHO order to become independent in production of blood related products. LFO was chosen as the company which would build such a manufacturing plant. The investment proposal received US$34 million in credit mainly from such banks as Kredyt Bank. In 1998 LFO signed a licensing agreement with Australian company CSL Limited. In 1999 the bank stopped giving credit to the investment and in 2000 CSL withdrew from the project. In 2000 LFO signed a new licensing agreement with Octapharma. In 2001 the bank finally withdrew from credit agreement and the National Public Prosecutor's Office started to investigate the project. LFO's investors were: * Zygmunt Niziol (company by the name of Nedepol) * David Minotte and Robert Lewis * Wlodzimierz Wapinski * Bjorn Hedberg Main aspects of the LFO scandal Polish media inquired about the following issues, which indicated abuses during construction of the factory: *Charges against Zygmunt Nizioł for extortion of US$21 million in credit and for larceny of $8 million and €1 million. *The need to return 61 million zlotys by LFO to the banks, which amount was guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance in 2006, despite the fact that a year earlier the Supreme Chamber of Control of the Republic of Poland established that the credit agreement was not valid, because LFO did not complete all the formalities in front of the bank. *The pressure of officers linked to Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski to continue the LFO project despite lack of merit. *The disappearance of documents regarding the project at the Ministry of Health.

Founded in 1890, it is the oldest hospital in San Diego County and has campuses in Chula Vista and Hillcrest. The hospital has 700 acute-care- licensed beds and employs 1,300 physicians. The Hillcrest campus is home to one of only two regional Level I Trauma Centers and receives more than 2,100 trauma patients each year. History In 1890, the Sisters of Mercy opened a five-bed dispensary called St. Joseph's in Downtown San Diego, with the permission of Bishop Francisco Mora y Borrell. The dispensary was replaced by a three-story hospital in Hillcrest called St. Joseph's Sanitarium in 1891, which was renamed to St. Joseph's Hospital in 1904. It remained the sole hospital for San Diego, until County Hospital was built at the top of Sixth Street, above Mission Valley, in 1903. In 1921, as St. Joseph's Sanitarium, the hospital became the first hospital accredited by the American College of Surgeons that is west of the Mississippi River. The current hospital building, also in Hillcrest, was built in 1925 and named Mercy Hospital. A second hospital, Bay General Hospital, was established in Chula Vista. In 1986, Bay General joined the Scripps Health system, as did Mercy Hospital in 1995 (which then became Scripps Mercy Hospital). Prior to its being under Scripps Health, it was part of Catholic Health Care West. Even after it joining Scripps Health, it remains a Catholic hospital. In 2004, the two hospitals were combined at the Hillcrest campus. As recently as 2015, Nuns of Sisters of Mercy continue to work at the hospital, but fulfilling more spiritual needs rather than direct care.

Members  Valery Chalidze was a writer and dissident who published the samizdat journal Social Problems. Andrei Sakharov was an eminent Soviet nuclear physicist who had publicly opposed the Soviet plans for atmospheric nuclear tests. In 1968, Sakharov had published \\"Progress, Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom,\\" a plea for nuclear disarmament emphasizing the role of human rights. As a result, his professorship was revoked by Soviet authorities. He became a spokesman for the human rights in the Soviet Union. The third founding member was physicist Andrey Tverdokhlebov. Later the Committee was joined by Igor Shafarevich, a mathematician and corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences. Mathematician Aleksandr Yesenin-Volpin and physicist Boris Zukerman became legal experts for the group. Writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and dissident bard Aleksandr Galich became honorary members. The Committee was also joined by Grigory Podyapolsky. Other prominent members of the Committee included Yelena Bonner and Pavel Litvinov.  Goals  Unlike its predecessor, the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR, the Committee functioned within a framework defined by its founding statutes. It was defined it as \\"a creative association acting in accordance with the laws of the land.\\" The goals of the committee were listed in their founding statement: * Consultative assistance to the organs of government in the establishment and application of guarantees of human rights; * Research into the theoretical aspects of the human rights question and into the specific nature of this question in a socialist society; * Legal education of the public, including the publication of international and Soviet documents on human rights. The Committee opposed secret trials, capital punishment, and punitive psychiatry. It specifically ruled out any cooperation with organizations that sought the overthrow of the Soviet state.  Activities  The Committee was the first independent association in the Soviet Union to receive membership in an international organization. In June 1971, it became an affiliate of the International League of Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization with consultative status under the United Nations, and International Institute of Human Rights. It also became a member of the International Institute of Law. The Committee was kept under constant surveillance by the KGB. Head of the KGB Yuri Andropov wrote in a report to the Central Committee of 1 March 1973: \\"The anti-social activities of the so- called Human Rights Committee decreased in 1972 as a result of measures taken by the KGB. These measures included compromising Chalidze's reputation, stripping him of Soviet citizenship [during his visit to the United States], and inciting disagreement and dissension among the Committee's members and sympathisers, which led to Tverdokhlebov's resignation.\\" According to Sakharov's memoirs, during 1973 and 1974, he, Grigory Podyapolsky and Igor Shafarevich continued to regularly meet at his apartment and continue the Committee's work on documenting human rights abuses. While several reports were produced, by then they began to feel the Committee had outlived its usefulness.

It is initiated by the vestibular system, which detects that the body is not erect and causes the head to move back into position as the rest of the body follows. The perception of head movement involves the body sensing linear acceleration or the force of gravity through the otoliths, and angular acceleration through the semicircular canals. The reflex uses a combination of visual system inputs, vestibular inputs, and somatosensory inputs to make postural adjustments when the body becomes displaced from its normal vertical position. These inputs are used to create what is called an efference copy. This means that the brain makes comparisons in the cerebellum between expected posture and perceived posture, and corrects for the difference. The reflex takes 6 or 7 weeks to perfect, but can be affected by various types of balance disorders. The righting reflex has also been studied in cats and other non-human mammals. See: cat righting reflex  Overview  = Vestibular system = The vestibular system is composed of inner ear organs forming the \\"labyrinth\\": the semicircular canals, the otoliths, and the cochlea. The section below is an overview of the vestibular system, as it is crucial to the understanding of the righting reflex. Sensory information from the vestibular system allows the head to move back into position when disturbed as the rest of the body follows. The semicircular canals (brown, see figure) are arranged at angles to the horizontal plane of the head when it is in its normal vertical posture. Each canal has a widened base, called an ampulla, that houses specialized sensory hair cells. Fluid in these canals surrounds the hair cells, and moves across them as the head moves to gather information about the movement and position of the body. The hair cells are covered in tiny sensory hairs called stereocilia, which are sensitive to displacement forces as the body is moved in different positions. When the head is moved, the force moves the hair cells forward, which sends signals to afferent fibers and on to the brain. The brain can then decide which muscles in the body need to become active in order to right itself. The semicircular canals have a superior, posterior, and horizontal component. Studies have shown that the horizontal canal is most correlated with agility, as shown with several mammals. Curvature and size of these canals seems to affect agility, and may be due to the environments in which animals navigate, such as a mostly two-dimensional landscape as compared to three-dimensional spaces (i.e. in the air, the trees, or the water). The otoliths have two components: the utricle and the saccule. Both are made of the same sensory tissue containing hair cells, which is covered by a gelatinous layer and the otolithic membrane on top. Embedded in this membrane are calcium carbonate crystals, called otoconia, or \\"ear rocks.\\" As the head is tilted forward or backward, the otoconia move the hair cells in a similar fashion to the semicircular canal fluid movement and cause depolarization of the hair cells. Signals from these cells are also transmitted along afferent fibers and on to the brain. = Signal transduction = Vestibular afferent signals are carried by type I or type II hair cells, which are distinguished by a larger amount of stereocilia per cell in type I cells than in type II cells. Nerve fibers attached to these hair cells carry signals to the vestibular nuclei in the brain, which are then used to gain information about the body's position. Larger diameter afferent fibers carry information from both type I and type II hair cells, and regular afferent fibers carry signals from type II hair cells. The semicircular canals encode head velocity signals, or angular acceleration, while the otoconia encode linear acceleration signals and gravitational signals. Regular afferent signals and irregular afferent signals travel to the vestibular nuclei in the brain, although irregular signals are at least two times more sensitive. Because of this, it has been questioned why humans have regular afferent signals. Studies have shown that regular afferent signals give information about how long the motion of the head or body lasts, and irregular afferent signals occur when the head is moved more violently, such as in falling.  Function  The righting reflex involves complex muscular movements in response to a stimulus. When startled, the brain can evoke anticipatory postural adjustments, or a series of muscle movements, which involves the function of the midbrain. However, the mechanisms of such an origin are yet to be elucidated. Data support the generation of these movements from circuits in the spine connected to the supplementary motor area, the basal ganglia, and the reticular formation. = Reference frames = Visual input for proper righting reflex function is perceived in the form of reference frames, which create a representation of space for comparison to expected orientation. Three types of reference frames are used to perceive vertical orientation; they are consistently updated and quickly adapting to process changes in vestibular input.  Allocentric reference frame  The allocentric reference frame describes a visual reference frame based on the arrangement of objects in an organism's environment. To test for the use of an allocentric reference frame, a \\"rod-and-frame\\" test, in which a subject's perception of virtual objects in an environment are altered, can be used to cause a body tilt as the subject believes to be correcting for the shift.  Egocentric reference frame  The egocentric reference frame refers to a proprioceptive reference frame using the position of an organism's body in a space. This reference frame relies heavily on somatosensory information, or feedback from the body's sensory system. Muscle vibrations can be used to alter a subject's perception of the location of their bodies by creating an abnormal somatosensory signal.  Geocentric reference frame  The geocentric reference frame involves visual inputs to help detect the verticality of an environment through gravitational pull. The sole of the foot contains receptors in the skin to detect the force of gravity, and plays a large role in standing or walking balance. The abdominal organs also contain receptors that provide geocentric information. \\"Roll-tilt\\" tests in which a subject's body is mechanically moved can be used to test for geocentric reference frame function. = Pathways = The righting reflex can be described as a three-neuron arc system composed of primary vestibular neurons, vestibular nuclei neurons, and target motorneurons. Input from the vestibular system is received by sensory receptors in the hair cells of the semicircular canals and the otoliths, which are processed in the vestibular nuclei. The cerebellum is also active at this time for processing of what is called an efference copy, which compares expectations of the body's posture with how it is oriented at the time. The difference between expected posture and actual posture is corrected for via motorneurons in the spinal cord, which control muscle movements for righting the body. These automatic postural adjustments can be explained in terms of two reflexes similar to the righting reflex: the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and the vestibulocollic reflex (VCR). The VOR involves movement of the eyes while the head turns to remain fixated on a stationary image, and the VCR involves control of neck muscles for correction of the head's orientation. During the VOR, the semicircular canals send information to the brain and correct eye movements in the direction opposite head movement by sending excitatory signals to motor neurons on the side opposite to the head rotation. Neurons in the otoliths control not only these signals for control of eye movements, but also signals for head movement correction through the neck muscles. The righting reflex utilizes the VOR and VCR as it brings the body back into position. Visual information under the control of these reflexes creates greater stability for more accurate postural correction. = Tests for righting reflex function = Vestibular function can be tested through a series of visual acuity tests. The static visual acuity test investigates a patient's ability to see an object from a distance by placing a subject at a certain distance from a letter fixed on a screen. The dynamic visual acuity test involves a patient's ability to control eye movements by following letters that appear on a screen. The difference between these two test results is the patient's fixation ability and vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) efficiency.Badaracco C, Labini FS, Meli A, Tufarelli D: Oscillopsia in labyrinthine defective patients: comparison of objective and subjective measures. Am J Otolaryngol 2010, 31(6):399-403. Vestibular reflexes can also be examined using body tilt experiments. Patients with vestibular disorders may go through the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, in which the patient is seated with legs extended and rotates the head 45 degrees. The patient is then asked to lie down on the table and checked for nystagmus, or uncontrollable eye movements. Nystagmus in patients indicates dysfunction of the vestibular system, which can lead to dizziness and inability to complete a righting reflex. Proprioceptive ability tests are important in testing for righting reflex function. A therapist may ask a patient whether he or she knows where a certain limb or joint is located without looking at it. These tests are often conducted on uneven surfaces, including sand and grass. Recently, vestibular reflexes have been investigated using leg rotation experiments. A leg and foot rotation test can be used to investigate changes in neuron activity within the labyrinth, or the inner ear. When the head is rotated while the leg and foot are rotated 90 degrees, the vestibular signals cause the brain to inhibit movement in the direction of the rotation. At the same time, it activates the muscles on the opposite side in an attempt to correct for the displacement.Grasso C, Barresi M, Scattina E, Orsini P, Vignali E, Bruschini L, Manzoni D: Tuning of human vestibulospinal reflexes by leg rotation. Hum Mov Sci 2011, 30(2):296-313. Plasticity Because visual input is so critical in proper righting reflex function, impairment of vision can be detrimental. Blind patients can rely on vestibular input where visual input is not available, and the visual cortex can become rewired to accommodate other senses taking control. Developmentally blind patients have a larger portion of the brain dedicated to vestibular and somatosensory input than patients with normal visual function. Recently blind patients must form new connections where visual inputs once were, and vestibular therapy may enhance this ability. This principle, called neuroplasticity, is of growing interest to researchers today.  Disorders  Many inner ear disorders can cause dizziness, which leads to dysfunctional righting reflex action. Common inner ear disorders can cause vertigo in patients, which can be acute or chronic symptoms. Labyrinthitis, or inflammation of the inner ear, can cause imbalances that must be overcome through therapeutic exercises. Labyrinthectomy, or removal of inner ear organs, is an operation conducted for patients with severe inner ear disorders whose vertigo is debilitating. Imbalances result from the procedure, but therapy can help overcome the symptoms.Lao Z, Sha Y, Chen B, Dai C-F, Huang W-H, Cheng Y-S: Labyrinthine sequestrum: four case studies. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery 2012, 147(3):535-537. = Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo = Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV, is a disorder caused by the breaking off of a piece of otoconia from the otoliths. The otoconia floats freely in the inner ear fluid, causing disorientation and vertigo. The disorder can be tested for using a nystagmus test, such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. This disorder can disrupt the function of the righting reflex as the symptoms of vertigo and disorientation prevent proper postural control. Treatment for the disorder includes antihistamines and anticholinergics, and the disorder often goes away without surgical removal of the free otoconia. = Ménière's disease = Ménière's disease is thought to be a balance disorder involving fluid buildup in the inner ear. This can result from a number of factors, including head injury, ear infection, genetic predisposition, chemical toxicity, allergies, or syphilis. Syphilis can cause some patients to develop the disease later in life. The disease is characterized by pressure in the ears, ringing in the ears, and vertigo. It also causes nystagmus, or uncontrollable eye movements. There is no known treatment for the disorder, although symptoms can be treated. These include water pills to thin out ear fluid, eating a low-salt diet, and taking anti-nausea medication. = Other causes of righting reflex disorders = Vestibular and balance disorders can have a number of contributing factors. Dietary factors such as a high-salt diet, high caffeine intake, high sugar intake, monosodium glutamate (MSG) intake, dehydration, or food allergies can contribute to symptoms of vertigo and should be avoided in balance disorder patients. Other disorders can have symptoms of vertigo associated with them, such as epilepsy, migraine, stroke, or multiple sclerosis. Infectious diseases such as Lyme disease and meningitis can also cause vertigo. Righting reflex in animals As a cat falls, it turns its head, rotates its spine, and aligns its hindquarters to land on its feet. This motion, coupled with free fall, creates a net zero angular momentum.Nguyen, H: \\"How does a cat always land on its feet?\\" Georgia Institute of Technology, Department of Biomedical Engineering. The righting reflex is not exclusive to humans. A well-known righting reflex in cats allows them to land on their feet after a fall. As a cat falls, it turns its head, rotates its spine, aligns its hindquarters, and arches its back to minimize injury.\\"Cats: A Cat's Nine Lives.\\" Video. National Geographic 2012. http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/animals/mammals- animals/cats/cats_domestic_ninelives/ The cat reaches free fall to accomplish this, which is much lower than that of humans, and they are able to hit the ground in a relaxed body form to prevent serious injury. Bats, however, have a unique vestibular system anatomy. Their balance system, at an orientation 180 degrees opposite to that of humans, allows them to perform powerful feats of flight while hunting in the dark. This ability couples vestibular function with sensory echolocation to hunt prey. Forman S: \\"Bats with frikkin' lasers.\\" The Brown Daily Herald. 10 March 2010. http://www.browndailyherald.com/bats- with-frikkin-lasers-1.2186630#.UKqC2rvK3B8 However, they lack a righting reflex similar to most mammals. When exposed to zero-G, bats do not undergo the series of righting reflexes that most mammals do to correct orientation because they are accustomed to resting upside-down.Fejtek M, Delorme M, Wassersug R: Behavioral reactions of the bat Carollia perspicillata to abrupt changes in gravity.

Life He was born on 30 May 1797 in Westport, Ireland, where his father held a curacy, the only son of Walter Shirley, by his wife Alicia, daughter of Sir Edward Newenham. His grandfather was Walter Shirley. At the age of nine, Shirley was placed under the care of the Rev. Legh Richmond but was soon moved to a school at Linton in Essex. He became a scholar of Winchester College in 1809, and six years later was elected to a scholarship at New College, Oxford, where he became a Fellow in 1818. After his ordination on 7 August 1820, he took charge of the parish of Woodford, Northamptonshire, one of the livings held by his father. In 1821 he became curate of Parwich in Derbyshire. In 1822 he was appointed assistant lecturer of Ashbourne and curate of Atlow and was awarded the prize for the English essay at Oxford, the subject being the Study of Moral Evidence. He acted as chaplain at Rome in the winter of 1826–7, and during his residence there he became intimately acquainted with Christian Karl Josias von Bunsen and Thomas Erskine, as well as with Charles Lock Eastlake and David Wilkie. In the autumn of 1827 he was married at Paris to Maria, daughter of William Waddington, and at the same time, his father resigned the living of St Michael's Church, Shirley in his favour. He took possession of his new home in January 1828. After nine years' residence at Shirley, he accepted the living of Whiston, near Rotherham, which he held jointly with Shirley. He gave up the former cure two years later when he was appointed to the incumbency of Brailsford, a parish adjoining that of Shirley. In 1829 he alienated some of his friends by his outspoken advocacy of Catholic emancipation; in later years he estranged others by refusing to support measures against the Tractarians. His own upbringing and views were evangelical. He was made Archdeacon of Derby by the bishop of Lichfield on 21 December 1840. In November 1846 he was appointed Bishop of Sodor and Man by Lord John Russell; but because of a serious illness, he was not consecrated until 10 January 1847. He had been elected Bampton lecturer for that year but lived only long enough to deliver two of the lectures of his course. He died at Bishop's Court, Isle of Man, on 21 April 1847. His only son was Walter Waddington Shirley. Among his pupils were Stafford Henry Northcote and his nephew, William Henry Waddington, the French minister. Works In addition to his Oxford prize essay, Shirley published A Charge to the Clergy of the Archdeaconry of Derby, 1846. The two Bampton lectures that he had delivered, together with two others which he had completed before death overtook him, were published in 1847 under the title of The Supremacy of the Holy Scriptures.

History Medicine Unboxed is a not-for-profit organisation that has held eight international conferences (Unboxing Medicine, 2009; Stories, Language and Medicine, 2010; Medicine and Values, 2011; Belief, 2012; Voice, 2013; Frontiers, 2014; Mortality, 2015; Wonder, 2016; MAPS, 2017) in Cheltenham, UK. The aim of Medicine Unboxed is to explore \\"understanding medicine through the arts and humanities\\", and engage the public and front- line National Health Service staff with a view of medicine that is infused and elaborated by the humanities, with a view to promoting dialogue around the goals and values of medicine within society. Contributors to the conferences include artists, writers, the clergy, poets, philosophers, lawyers, linguists, musicians, theatre, ethicists, academics and doctors. Medicine Unboxed is curated by Dr. Sam Guglani, Consultant Oncologist at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, that supports the organisation along with the Wellcome Foundation. The Creative Director is Peter Thomas. Its advisors are Dr. Sean Elyan and Dame Janet Trotter and its patrons are Jo Shapcott and Raymond Tallis.

It is endemic to New Zealand. Taxonomy This species was described by Edward Meyrick in 1885 using material collected in Dunedin and named Heterocrossa cryodana. In 1922 Meyrick listed Heterocrossa as a synonym for Carposina. George Hudson, in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand, discusses this species under the name Carposina cryodana. Alfred Philpott studied the male genitalia of this species in 1928. In 1978 Elwood Zimmerman argued that the genus Heterocrassa should not be a synonym of Carposina as the genitalia of the species within the genus Heterocrassa are distinctive. In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species back to the genus Heterocrossa. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Description This species was described by Meyrick as follows: Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand. It has been collected in Dunedin and Invercargill and Codfish Island. Biology and behaviour This species is on the wing in September and November. It is associated with Leptospermum species. Larvae of the species have been found on fruits.

Walter Waddington Shirley (1828–1866) was an English churchman and ecclesiastical historian. Life The only son of Walter Augustus Shirley, bishop of Sodor and Man, he was born at Shirley, Derbyshire, on 24 July 1828. In 1837 he became pupil no. 2, second only to the headmaster's son, at Lieutenant C.R. Malden's preparatory school (now known as Windlesham House School) founded in that year at Newport, Isle of Wight. He left in 1839 for Rugby School under Thomas Arnold. His closest friend at Rugby and throughout his life was his cousin, William Henry Waddington, later in French politics. In June 1846 Shirley matriculated at University College, Oxford, but in the following year he migrated to Wadham College, where he had gained a scholarship and became president of the Oxford Union.The Oxford Union 1823-1923, p. 315 He obtained a first class in the honour school of mathematics in 1851, and in 1852 was elected a Fellow of his college. He had to vacate his fellowship three years later, on his mother's death, when he inherited a small landed property. From 1855 to 1863 he was tutor and mathematical lecturer of Wadham. It was during this period that he began historical study. His theological views underwent considerable change; the position which Shirley occupied at the time of his death was still a provisional one. Having been in his early days a disciple of Arnold, he ultimately came to regard ‘undogmatic Christianity’ as a contradiction in terms. In May 1863, he preached in the university church a sermon on the unreasonableness of Arnold's teaching. Later that year he was made regius professor of ecclesiastical history and canon of Christ Church, Oxford. He was one of the pioneers of the university extension movement, and played a part in the founding of Keble College. His career was cut short at the age of thirty- eight. He died on 20 November 1866. Works In 1858 his edition of Fasciculi Zizaniorum Magistri Johannis Wyclif was published in the Rolls Series. He began a life of John Wiclif, which he did not live to complete, though in 1865 he published ‘Catalogue of the Original Works of John Wiclif,’ Oxford. In 1862 he edited for the Rolls Series ‘Royal and other Historical Letters illustrative of the Reign of Henry III.’ He also published a lecture on ‘Scholasticism,’ delivered before the university of Oxford, 1866. After his death a small volume by him, entitled ‘Some Account of the Church in the Apostolic Age,’ was published by the Clarendon Press.

She had long relationships with the novelist George Moore and the conductor Thomas Beecham, and was the muse of the former and a champion of and fund-raiser for the latter. She was a supporter of Wallis Simpson during the British abdication crisis of 1936, vainly hoping for a court appointment. The Second World War ended her era of private patronage and lavish hospitality.  Biography  = Early years = Maud Burke was born in San Francisco, to an Irish-American father, James Burke (who claimed descent from the Irish rebel Robert Emmet) and his half-French wife.Marcus, Jane. \\"Cunard, Nancy Clara (1896–1965)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, September 2010, accessed 16 March 2011 She was brought up in New York, where she became a devotee of music, hearing her first Wagner (the complete Ring cycle) when she was 12. She hoped to marry Prince André Poniatowski, grandson of the last King of Poland,Hamilton, Ian, \\"Mother and daughter of character\\", The Illustrated London News, 6 July 1968, p. 30 but he jilted her and in April 1895 she married Sir Bache Cunard, 3rd Baronet, grandson of the founder of the Cunard shipping line. He was 21 years her senior, and despite his affection for her, they had little in common. He preferred to live at his country house, Nevill Holt Hall, in Leicestershire, where he was a keen huntsman. His wife began to establish a reputation as a hostess, \\"with a taste for the arts, or for artists anyhow, especially musicians\\", and was known for being extremely well read in French and English literature. Lady Cunard as Britannia, with Sir Thomas Beecham, 1919 Among Lady Cunard's artistic friends was the novelist George Moore, who was deeply in love with her, and to whom she was an inspiration, appearing in many guises in his novels. Moore's love was reciprocated less strongly by Lady Cunard.\\"Literary Love Affair\\", The Times, 26 September 1957, p. 13 The Cunards had a daughter, Nancy, in 1896, described by a biographer as \\"gifted and lonely\\" and largely neglected by her parents. Moore did not discourage the widespread belief that he, not Cunard, was Nancy's father, but this is not generally credited by historians, and it is not certain that Moore's relationship with Nancy's mother was ever more than platonic. Moore was believed by some to be impotent and was described as \\"one who told but didn't kiss\\".Lyttelton, Letters of 23 February 1956 and 4 December 1958 = London hostess = In 1911, leaving Cunard in Leicestershire, Lady Cunard moved to London with Nancy. The biographer Alan Jefferson writes, \\"Soon she had captured all London society, and her … salon became the most important Mecca for musicians, painters, sculptors, poets and writers as well as for politicians, soldiers, aristocrats – indeed anybody so long as they were interesting\\". The Times wrote of her, \\"Lady Cunard was probably the most lavish hostess of her day.\\"Obituary, The Times, 12 July 1948, p. 7 The then Prince of Wales met Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, at her home in 1935. In 1911, the Cunards formally separated by common agreement. At about this time, to the dismay of Moore, Lady Cunard fell in love with the conductor Thomas Beecham and became widely recognised in society as his companion. She was a tireless fund-raiser and persuaded many rich and upper-class people to support Beecham's extravagant operatic ventures. This was always important to Beecham, and it became more so after the First World War, when his finances were much depleted. Cunard died in 1925, and his widow never remarried. In the years after Cunard's death, she took to calling herself \\"Emerald\\", by which name she was known for the rest of her life (though not by either Moore or Beecham). = Later years = David Lloyd George considered Lady Cunard \\"a most dangerous woman\\", because although she was not greatly interested in politics, she beguiled senior politicians such as Lord Curzon into indiscreet statements at her dinner table.Masters, Brian. \\"When secrets were served with the soup\\", The Times, 30 October 1982, p. 8 Among her regular guests in the 1930s was her fellow American Wallis Simpson, whose liaison with Edward, Prince of Wales she encouraged, thus reinforcing Queen Mary's disapproval of the Cunard set. Believing that Mrs. Simpson would become queen, Lady Cunard hoped to be rewarded with the post of Mistress of the Robes in the new court. When her dream was dashed by Edward's abdication in 1936, she wept and lamented \\"How could he do this to me!\\" In the aftermath of the abdication, Cunard's association with Simpson tainted her social reputation considerably, although she took pains to distance herself, telling friends she had never met Wallis. At events attended by the Royal Family, Cunard would have to wait until they left before she could gain admission. Lady Diana Cooper described Cunard's generous habit of helping out friends in financial trouble: \\"If Emerald caught me or my kind forgoing a treat for economy's sake, she would casually call, pretend to fancy a picture or a table or a rug, and insist on buying it for double its worth.\\" In this way she accumulated an eclectic assortment of art and furniture, which was part of a more focused collection of valuable 18th century French furniture she had acquired over the years on the expert advice of friends and dealers. The outbreak of the Second World War marked the end of the lavish entertainment and private patronage of hostesses such as Lady Cunard and her rival Sibyl, Lady Colefax. Beecham's residence in the US in the early years of the war led Lady Cunard to move to New York, where she set up home in a luxurious hotel. In 1942, she learned from an acquaintance that Beecham was going to marry the pianist Betty Humby. She returned to London and moved into the Dorchester Hotel where she died, miserable and lonely, at the age of 75. Her ashes were scattered in Grosvenor Square.

John Lorne Campbell has written, however, that by the lifetime of North Uist Bard John MacCodrum (1694-1779), the statement that a Scottish Gael was \\"illiterate\\" meant only that they couldn't read or write in English. According to Campbell, \\"In MacCodrum's day little education was available for the Highlanders, and none at all in their own language.\\" Campbell (1971), Highland Songs of the Forty-Five, page 246, footnote 1. According to Bill Lawson, \\"T.S. Muir stated in 1867 that he was told 'that one Macpherson, an octogenarian living at Cladach Cairinis, remembers having seen, when a boy, stones figured with angels, armed men, animals, etc.' This must have been John MacPherson -- Iain Mac Eoghainn - whose descendants still live in the township. The description of the stones suggests something like the scene s on the tomb of Alasdair Crotach MacLeod in St. Clement's Church in Roghadal in Harris, but any such stones have long since disappeared. Alexander Carmichael surmises that, being of freestone, they were carried away for sharpening stones. Carmichael also states that there was formerly a pinnacle on the east gable, with the figure of a three- headed giant on the top, presumably representing the Trinity, but that too had long gone. One stone, carved in the shape of a human head, has been preserved, and is now in the museum of Taigh Chearsabhagh in Loch nam Madadh.\\" Bill Lawson (2004), North Uist in History and Legend, Birlinn.

Kenneth MacLeod of Gigha, who collaborated with Marjory Kennedy-Fraser in collecting Scottish Gaelic songs, wrote in 1907, \\"In the early days of the nineteenth century, the North Uist people, on a day still spoken of, reverently laid in their Temple of the Trinity an unknown body washed ashore by the flowing tide: at twilight a mysterious-looking barge glided into the bay, three of its crew marched up silently to the temple, opened the newly- made grave, carried off the body, and then disappeared forever into the darkness and the great open sea.\\" Bill Lawson (2004), North Uist in History and Legend, Birlinn.

In 1922 Meyrick classified Heterocrossa as a synonym of the genus Carposina. George Hudson, in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand, discusses this species as a synonym of Carposina gonosemana.

It was developed by Hunston, Francis, and Manning as part of the COBUILD project. It is a highly informal account that suggests a linear view of grammar (as opposed to phrase-structure or dependency grammars). Each word has a set of patterns assigned to it which describe typical contexts in which they are used. Often these are separate for different word senses.  Pattern Notation  Patterns are given as sequence of lower-case grammatical elements, with the central element of the pattern in upper case. The elements are either labels for grammatical categories ('v' for verb, 'n' for noun group, 'prep' for preposition) or actual lexical items (for example specific prepositions).  Examples: SKIM  The word skim includes the following patterns in the COBUILD dictionary: = V n off/from n = Skim is a verb, and as the pattern describes its behaviour it is in upper case. The verb is then followed by a noun group, a preposition (either off or from) and a second noun group. This pattern applies for example to \\"She skimmed the cream off the milk\\". The choice of preposition is limited to those two options, which is why they are specified directly instead of using the broader category 'prep'. = V n = This pattern describes the use of skim in \\"...re-surface all the walls by skimming the surface smooth ready for painting...\\" = V over/across n = \\"I was wondering if someone who speaks French could skim over it for me and correct it.\\" = V through n = \\"You can skim through our step-by-step guide and find out why\\" References Further reading * Francis, Gill; Hunston, Susan; Manning, Elizabeth, Collins COBUILD Grammar Patterns 1: Verbs, HarperCollins, 1996. * Francis, Gill; Hunston, Susan; Manning, Elizabeth, Collins COBUILD Grammar Patterns 2: Nouns and Adjectives, HarperCollins, 1997. * Hunston, Susan; Francis, Gill, Pattern Grammar: A corpus-driven approach to the lexical grammar of English, John Benjamins, 2000.

It is endemic to New Zealand. The larvae of this species feed on the healing wounds of New Zealand beech trees.  Taxonomy  This species was described by Edward Meyrick in 1888 using a specimen he collected in Wellington in January. In 1922 Meyrick classified Heterocrossa as a synonym of the genus Carposina. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand.

Dugdale assigned the species back to the genus Heterocrossa. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  H. eriphylla was described by Meyrick as follows:  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. This species is found in the North Island and northern parts of the South Island. Specimens of this moth have been collected near the Wellington Botanic Gardens and at the Orongorongo Valley, as well as near Woodville in hill country. This moth has also been collected at Paroa. H. eriphylla is regarded as being relatively uncommon.  Biology and behaviour  The adult moths are on the wing in December to April, May and June. This moth is a night flier and is attracted to light. During the day the adult moths rest on tree trunks where their variable lichen mimicking colouration assists with their camouflage. W. P. Cohen stated that he collected his specimens during the day while they were at rest on the trunks of weeping-willows. The larvae of this species feed on the callus tissue generated by their host trees as a result of damage caused by other insects. The larvae are believed to facilitate the development of rot in beech trees by keeping wounds open to the air. The species pupates at their feeding site.  Host species  Host species Fuscospora truncata H. eriphylla lives in native forest habitat. The larvae of this species feed on the wood of the beech trees Fuscospora fusca and Fuscospora truncata.

He first played in the 1978 VFL season and in his second game, against Fitzroy at Junction Oval, he kicked five behinds, but only one goal. Despite starting as a forward he was often as a full-back by South Melbourne and he had his most productive season in 1979 with 17 appearances. He played some good football from centre half- forward in 1980 and in a win over Footscray took nine marks and had 21 disposals. In 1981 he was involved in a three-way trade, which resulted in him joining SANFL club Central District.

Life and work Cooke was born in London in 1781. His father was a native of Frankfurt, Germany, who in early life settled in England and became a wholesale confectioner. At the age of 14, George Cooke was apprenticed to James Basire (1730-1802). Around the end of his apprenticeship he engraved many plates for Brewer's The Beauties of England and Wales, some in conjunction with his elder brother, William Bernard Cooke. Afterwards, he produced engravings for Pinkerton's 16-volume Collection of Voyages and Travels, during which his brother William made plans for the first edition of The Thames, to which George Cooke contributed two plates.The Thames etc (Vernor, Hood & Sharpe and W.B. Cooke, 1811). This work was followed by Picturesque Views on the Southern Coast of England, from drawings made principally by Turner.Joseph Mallord William Turner. Picturesque views on the southern coast of England (J. and A. Arch, 1826). It was commenced in 1814 and completed in 1826, and George Cooke engraved 15 plates, nearly one-third of the total, and some vignettes. Next appeared an improved edition of The Thames, for which he engraved the 'Launch of the Nelson' and the 'Fair on the Thames,' after Luke Clennell, and the 'Opening of Waterloo Bridge,' after Philip Reinagle. Phlox carnea\\", engraving after William Miller (from \\"The Botanical Cabinet\\", 1818) Between 1817 and 1833 he produced, in connection with Loddiges of Hackney, London a number of plates for the Botanical Cabinet,'Conrad Loddiges (and sons). The Botanical Cabinet (J. & A. Arch, 1822) and about the same time he engraved some of the plates, after Turner, for Hakewill's Picturesque Tour of Italy, 1820,James Hakewill. A picturesque tour of Italy: from drawings made in 1816-1817 (J. Murray, 1820). and Sir Walter Scott's Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland, 1826,Walter Scott. Provincial antiquities of Scotland, volume II (R. Cadell, 1834). in which latter work should be especially noted \\"Edinburgh from the Calton Hill\\". To these were added plates for Thomas Allason's Antiquities of Pola, 1819, John Spencer-Stanhope's Olympia, (pub. Rodwell and Martin, 1824), and D'Oyly and Mant's Bible,George D'Oyly & Richard Mant. The Holy Bible (Clarendon press, 1818). as well as some of those for John Hughes' Views in the South of France, chiefly on the Rhone, after Peter De Wint. Besides these he engraved a few plates for the publications of the Dilettanti Society, and for the Ancient Marbles in the British Museum,A description of the collection of ancient marbles in the British museum (W. Bulmer and co, 1812). and the Ancient TerracottasA description of the collection of ancient terracottas in the British Museum (W. Bulmer and Co., 1810). in the same collection, and single plates after Turner of a \\"View of Gledhow\\" for Whitaker's Loidis and Elmete, and \\"Wentworth House\\" for Thomas Dunham Whitaker's History of Richmondshire. He also engraved the \\"Iron Bridge at Sunderland\\", from an outline by Edward Blore; for Surtees's History of Durham; and the \\"Monument of Sir Francis Bacon\\" in St Michael's Church, St Albans, for Robert Clutterbuck's History of Hertfordshire. In 1825, he finished his fine engraving of \\"Rotterdam\\", from Augustus Wall Callcott's picture belonging to the Earl of Essex, and shortly afterwards issued a prospectus announcing a series of plates from Callcott's works, of which two, \\"Antwerp\\" and \\"Dover\\", were begun and considerably advanced when vexation at the loss of the proceeds of his 'Rotterdam,'caused by the failure of his agent, led to their abandonment. He then began, in 1826, the Views in London and its Vicinity,George Cooke. Views in London and its vicinity (1826-34) engraved from drawings by Callcott, Stanfield, Roberts, Prout, Stark, Harding, Cotman, and Havell, ending with the 12th issue just before his death. In 1833, he produced Views of the Old and New London Bridges, executed conjointly with his son, Edward William Cooke, who also made the drawings. He also produced plates for Frederick Nash's Views in Paris, Colonel Batty's Views of European Cities, Baron Taylor's Spain (pub. Robert Jennings), Rhodes's Peak Scenery and Yorkshire Scenery, several for Stark's Scenery of the Rivers of Norfolk, and one of \\"Southampton\\", after Copley Fielding, for the Gallery of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. Cooke was one of the original members of the \\"Society of Associated Engravers\\", who joined together for the purpose of engraving the pictures in the National Gallery, and two of his plates were in preparation at the time of his death. He likewise attempted engraving in mezzotint, and in that style executed a plate of 'Arundel Castle,' after Turner; but it was not a success, and was never published. Cooke died of 'brain fever' on 27 February 1834 at Barnes, where he was buried.

Description  Meyrick described this species as follows: This species is variable in appearance and tends to be of a darker shade in the more southern parts of New Zealand in comparison to the northern localities.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. This species is found throughout the country and has been collected at Wellington, Nelson, Otira River, Dunedin, Lake Wakatipu, Invercargill, Stewart Island, and Auckland Island.  Biology and behaviour  This species is on the wing from November until February. It can be found during the day resting on tree trucks where it blends well with lichen patches. The larvae of this species is very active when it is disturbed. This species spends the winter as a pupa. The pupa is 8mm in length and is greenish-white in colour. Its abdominal segments are short while the leg and wing cases are unusually large. The pupa is enclosed in a cocoon that can be found in the soil beneath the larvae host. The cocoon is oval in shape and approximately 12mm in length. The adult moth emerged in December when bred in captivity. The adult moth is attracted to light.  Habitat and host species  Host of larvae Griselinia lucida This species prefers forest habitat. The larvae have been recorded feeding on seeds and fruit of Griselinia lucida. It is possible the larvae also feed on the fruit of Griselinia littoralis.

It is native to western New Mexico and eastern Arizona in the United States.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map It is a federally listed threatened species. Erigeron rhizomatus was thought to be a New Mexico endemic until 1999, when some plants were found over the border in Arizona.Erigeron rhizomatus. The Nature Conservancy. These are located in the Chuska Mountains on the Navajo Nation, and they occur in 15 populations that make up one metapopulation.United States Fish & Wildlife Service. Erigeron rhizomatus Five-year Review. September 2007. The two previously known metapopulations in New Mexico are composed of 24 populations in the Zuni, Datil, and Sawtooth Mountains. These three metapopulations are geographically isolated from each other but are still similar in morphology. Characteristics Erigeron rhizomatus is a perennial herb up to 45 cm (18 inches) tall, with a rhizome and large network of clumped, fibrous roots topped with a branching caudex. It produces one or more erect, rough-haired stems up to about 45 centimeters (18 inches) in maximum height. The leaves are lance-shaped near the base of the plant and much narrower and linear in shape toward the top of the stem. The inflorescence is usually a single flower head at the end of the stem with 25–45 white or purple-tinged ray florets each under a centimeter long. These surround many yellow disc florets.Erigeron rhizomatus. Flora of North America.Erigeron rhizomatus. New Mexico Rare Plant List. Habitat Erigeron rhizomatus grows in selenium-rich sandstone substrates that originate in the Baca and Chinle Formations. It occurs in barren outcrops of eroding red or grayish rock that may have slopes of up to 40 degrees.USFWS. Erigeron rhizomatus. FWS Redbook. Nearby plants include four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), rubber rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa), oneseed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis), and Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii).Erigeron rhizomatus. Arizona Game & Fish Department. Endangered status When Erigeron rhizomatus was listed for federal protection, it was potentially threatened by uranium mining activity in its habitat. There is probably still uranium in the area, as evidenced by large amounts of selenium in the soil, which often occurs with uranium. If the value of uranium increases and it becomes a target for mining, the activity could threaten the plant's habitat. One population of the plant also occurs in an area with potential for oil exploration activity. These are the only significant threats to the species at this time, but since it is a rare regional endemic known from specific habitat types it will stay on the endangered species list for the time being.

History  Mrs. William Russell Cooke, John Singer Sargent, 1895 Russell-Cooke was founded in London in 1880 by William Russell- Cooke and Sir Henry Paget-Cooke. In the 1890s the firm moved into Old Square, Lincoln’s Inn, where clients included the Liberal Party and members of the Royal Family. Following the Second World War, Russell-Cooke aligned itself with suburban firm Sloper, Potter & Chapman, based at 2 Putney Hill. The two firms eventually merged in 1958 to form Russell-Cooke Potter & Chapman, with Edward Chapman as senior partner. During the 1960s and 1970s Russell-Cooke Potter and Chapman expanded, developing a large commercial property department and attracted a number of famous clients from the pop and entertainment world. Edward Chapman’s son Lewin became senior partner. A new office in Kingston- upon-Thames was opened in the early 1990s which is now located on the river next to Kingston Bridge. After 100 years occupying the upper two floors of 2 Putney Hill, the firm took over the ground floor from the National Westminster Bank. Further growth during the nineties saw the Central London contingent move from Old Square into grade 2 listed buildings at 8 Bedford Row. In Putney, the firm later expanded into a nearby office block. In 2000 Russell- Cooke Potter and Chapman merged with Putney based firm Evill & Coleman’s Commercial Property, Private Client and Commercial departments.

Retrieved 17 March 2011. Craig allegedly colluded at times with the enemies of the UDA, Irish Republican groups such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), providing them with information on key loyalists which led to their subsequent murders. Aside from controlling rackets and extorting protection money from a variety of businesses, it was claimed that Craig also participated in paramilitary murders. He was accused by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) of setting up the assassinations of some of their key members by IRA hit squads, such as Shankill Butcher Lenny Murphy, John Bingham, and William \\"Frenchie\\" Marchant in the 1980s. Craig was murdered by the UDA, using their cover name of the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), for alleged \\"treason\\" as it was believed he had passed information to the IRA regarding South Belfast UDA commander John McMichael, who was killed by an IRA booby-trap car bomb in December 1987. Craig was shot dead in The Castle Inn, a pub in Beersbridge Road, East Belfast.

While serving his sentence at the Maze he joined the Ulster Defence Association (UDA),Dillon, p. 264 and he was asked by the organisation's commander at the time, Charles Harding Smith to take control of the UDA prisoners inside, on account of his reputation as a \\"hard man\\". =Criminal activities= After his release in 1976,Wood, Ian S.

Retrieved 2 June 2015 In 1985, Craig was brought to court after a number of businessmen decided to testify against him, with the condition that their identities remained hidden. The case fell apart when Craig's defence argued that his client's rights were violated by the concealment of the witnesses' identities. Craig was alleged to have been involved in the double killing of a Catholic man and a Protestant man on the Shankill Road in 1977. The men, both work colleagues, had entered a loyalist club and were later stabbed, shot and put into a car which was set on fire.McKittrick, et al Lost Lives, p. 700 By this time the West Belfast UDA no longer wanted him in their ranks, as they claimed they could no longer \\"afford him\\". Craig, who was ordered to leave the Shankill Road,Wood, p. 127 went on to join forces with John McMichael's South Belfast Brigade. In addition to being the principal fundraiser, Craig also sat on the UDA's Inner Council. Craig usually travelled in the company of his bodyguard Artie Fee, a UDA member from the Shankill Road. The rival Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) carried out an investigation after it was rumoured Craig had been involved in the death of UVF major William Marchant, who was gunned down by Provisional IRA gunmen from a passing car on the Shankill Road on 28 April 1987. Marchant was the third high-ranking UVF man to be killed by the IRA during the 1980s. Although their inquiries revealed that Craig had quarrelled with Marchant as well as Lenny Murphy and John Bingham prior to their killings, the UVF felt that there was not enough evidence to warrant an attack on such a powerful UDA figure as Craig.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. New York City: Routledge. pp. 262–63. Retrieved 17 March 2011. In December 1987, when South Belfast UDA brigadier John McMichael was blown up by an IRA booby-trap car bomb outside his home in Lisburn's Hilden estate, it was believed that Craig had organised his death with the IRA. Allegedly Craig had feared McMichael was about to expose his racketeering business, thus putting an end to his lucrative operation.Taylor, p. 171 McMichael had reportedly set up an inquiry and discovered that Craig was spending money on a lavish scale, going on holidays at least twice a year and indulging in a \\"champagne lifestyle\\".Dillon, p. 266 At the same time it was suggested that Craig had made certain deals with Irish republican paramilitary groups, dividing up the rackets in west Belfast, and he would have been doing the IRA a favour by helping them to eliminate a high-profile loyalist such as McMichael. Craig had established links with republicans during his time in prison, and the profitable deals and exchanges of information between them ensured he would most likely not be a target for IRA assassination. Craig was named as an extortionist in Central Television's 1987 programme The Cook Report. Craig planned to sue the programme's producers for libel; in January 1988, Jack Kielty (father of future television presenter Patrick Kielty), a building contractor from County Down who had promised to testify as a key witness against Craig, was murdered by the UDA. This killing was attributed to Craig, although it was never proven.Wood, Ian S. (2006). Crimes of Loyalty: a History of the UDA. Edinburgh University Press. p. 134. Google Books.

He was playing pool in the pub at the time of his fatal shooting by the two men, both of whom were wearing boiler suits and ski masks and carrying automatic weapons.Wood, p. 134 Upon spotting Craig they opened fire, spraying the room with gunfire. Craig died instantly; a bystander pensioner was also murdered in the attack, and four other bystanders were wounded by stray bullets. The UDA claimed the killing was carried out due to Craig's \\"treason\\" and involvement in John McMichael's murder as they knew he had provided the IRA with information to successfully carry out the assassination. They apologised for the unintentional death of the pensioner. Craig was not given a paramilitary funeral, and none of the UDA's command attended it. Andy Tyrie, the UDA's former supreme commander, was not convinced of Craig's complicity in McMichael's killing. In an interview with Peter Taylor, he stated that after McMichael's death, the UDA set up an inquiry, but couldn't find any solid proof which linked Craig to McMichael's assassination.Taylor, p. 199 Tyrie maintained that the two men had been good friends, and that Craig had given McMichael £20,000 to keep the latter's pub (The Admiral Benbow) from failing. Tyrie suggested that Craig was a suspect because his wife was Catholic. Tyrie insisted that John Hanna,In 1990 Hanna was convicted of helping the IRA assassinate a fellow prison officer and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Former IRA member Sean O'Callaghan, who met Hanna while in prison, described him as a \\"dangerous man\\". O'Callaghan recounted his dealings with Hanna in his autobiography, The Informer. a prison officer in the Maze, had supplied the IRA with information about McMichael through Rosena Brown, a Belfast actress and IRA intelligence operative, with whom Hanna had been infatuated.Wood, pp. 135–36 McMichael's son, Gary, however, firmly believed Craig to have been the person behind his father's killing.Wood, p. 135 Less than three months after McMichael's death, Tyrie himself narrowly escaped an attempt on his life by car bomb; he subsequently tendered his resignation as commander. Reputation According to McKittrick, Craig's \\"notoriety and range of enemies meant he could have been killed by almost any paramilitary group, loyalist or republican\\". Described as stocky of build, he wore expensive clothing and jewellery, and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle from the proceeds of his racketeering. Author and journalist Martin Dillon wrote that Craig was not intelligent but was \\"cunning, boastful and ruthless\\".Dillon, pp. 263–64 There was also much antipathy between him and UDA brigadier Tommy \\"Tucker\\" Lyttle due to Craig having allegedly made Lyttle's daughter pregnant. Lyttle died of natural causes in October 1995. It was later revealed that Lyttle had worked as an informer for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)'s Special Branch.McDonald, Henry. \\"Sordid Death of Top Gun\\". The Observer, 1 October 2000. Retrieved 20 March 2011. Craig reportedly invited RUC officers to an extravagant wedding reception held for his daughter. Author Sally Belfrage who encountered Craig at an \\"Eleventh night\\" party held at the UDA's east Belfast headquarters, summed him up as \\"the most personally powerful man I had ever met, with an air of animal force that inspired awe at the idea of its ever being let loose. He was also as drunk as I had ever seen anyone in my life who could still more or less negotiate a sentence and a sequence of steps.\\" She claimed Craig had propositioned her; when she rebuffed his advances he took it in his stride, and grabbing a microphone, went on to lead the other revellers in a rendition of \\"The Sash My Father Wore\\". Dillon, in his book about the violent loyalist gang, the Shankill Butchers, recounted how Craig casually killed a man in a UDA club after a fellow UDA member handed him a jammed pistol. Craig, testing the weapon, allegedly pointed it at a man who was playing pool, and shot him in the head, killing him instantly. Craig then gave orders for the man's body to be dumped in an adjacent alley.Dillon, p. 263. Dillon believes Craig had killed UDA commander William \\"Bucky\\" McCullough in October 1981 after the latter discovered Craig had been stealing funds from the UDA for his own personal use. The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) had claimed responsibility for the killing.CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths – 1981 Jackie McDonald, who was part of Craig's protection racket, was arrested in 1989. He had taken over McMichael's command of the South Belfast UDA, having been promoted to the rank of brigadier by Andy Tyrie in 1988. In January 1990, he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment inside the Maze for extortion, blackmail, and intimidation.\\"Building bridges with the UDA\\" , Irish Tribune, 23 November 2008. McDonald was released in 1994. In an interview with Peter Taylor, he made the following statement regarding his former association with Craig: > I would say without a shadow of doubt the worst thing that ever happened to > South Belfast, John McMichael and myself especially, was that Jim Craig ever > had anything to do with our organisation.Taylor, p. 172 One builder who later assisted the RUC when they set up an anti-racketeering unit, admitted that he had paid out protection money throughout the 1980s to Craig and his henchmen. The amount of money he handed over increased each year.Taylor, p. 171. In 1983, the builder paid Craig and his men the sum of £3,000; in 1984 it rose to £4,000, in 1985 it went up to £4,400, in 1986 it had increased to £5,400; and by 1987 he was forced to £7,800. Dillon suggested that prior to Craig's killing, younger elements within the UDA, who were loyal supporters of McMichael, discovered (by means which Dillon did not divulge) that the RUC's anti-racketeering squad CI3 had videotaped a clandestine meeting between Craig and a member of the IRA's Northern Command, which is what reportedly sealed Craig's fate.

Between stints as a player with the Trail Smoke Eaters, he was instrumental in developing hockey in Czechoslovakia throughout the 1930s and 1940s. He established the sport at the grassroots level while coaching the Czechoslovak national team to European and World Championship titles, as well as a silver medal at the 1948 Olympics. Hockey career Buckna began his career with his hometown amateur team, the Trail Smoke Eaters, in 1932. During his rookie year, he helped the team to a Savage Cup championship as the top provincial senior hockey team in British Columbia. Two years later, he went overseas to Prague, Czechoslovakia, to visit his parents' homeland. After joining LTC Praha's hockey club as player and coach, he continued on in the same dual role with the Czechoslovak national team. Buckna led the country to back-to-back European titles in 1938 and 1939. He returned home due to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia as part of World War II. Back in North America, he was offered a contract with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL) after a successful tryout, but declined. He resumed playing with the Smoke Eaters and led the club with 66 points in 1941–42. In 1946, Buckna moved back to Prague and was given authority over Czechoslovakia's entire hockey system. At the grassroots level, he established a minor hockey system, organized hockey clinics and coached junior and senior teams throughout the country. He resumed his head coaching position with the national team, leading them to the country's first ever World Championship title in 1947. The following year, he earned his third European title. At the 1948 Winter Olympics, the Czechoslovaks won a silver medal, losing only to Canada. Buckna returned home from Czechoslovakia a second time shortly after the Olympics due to the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état and resumed playing for the Smoke Eaters. In his first year back, he won his Savage Cup with the team. After retiring as a player, he was offered a coaching position with the Canadian national team in 1956, but declined, going on to coach the Rossland Warriors and Junior Smoke Eaters instead. Personal life Buckna was born in Trail, British Columbia to Slovak parents who emigrated to Canada from Podbiel, present-day Slovakia. He worked in his hometown with Cominco, a mining company, and in his family's hotel business. He met his wife, Aloisie Frolikova, a European champion tennis player, while playing and coaching hockey in Czechoslovakia; they were married in Prague on March 26, 1938. Buckna returned to Trail with Frolikova the following year. Following his retirement from hockey, he and his wife bought his family's hotel business, operating it until 1974. Two years later, his wife died on November 29, 1976. He continued to live in Trail until he died on January 6, 1996.

As a close associate of Andreas Papandreou, the founder and leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), Koutsogiorgas emerged as one of the most powerful cabinet member during PASOK's 1981–1989 government, and was widely regarded as Papandreou's heir apparent. Embroiled in the George Koskotas scandal however, he was brought before a Special Tribunal. During the procedure he collapsed in the court room on 11 April 1991 and died a week later.  Early life and professional career  Koutsogiorgas was born in May 1922 in the village of Rodini in Achaea. During the Axis Occupation of Greece in the Second World War, Koutsogiorgas was active in the Omiros resistance group, and was arrested and imprisoned by the Italian occupation authorities. He studied at the Law School of the University of Athens, and received his law degree in 1945. That same year, he became a police officer in the Athens branch of the City Police. He served as a police officer for seven years, until he resigned in 1952, in order to become a lawyer and open his own law firm.Γιώργος Λακόπουλος, Το μυθιστόρημα του ΠΑΣΟΚ, 1999, σελίδες 70-71 In 1958 he obtained a postgraduate degree in Public Law from the Law Faculty of the University of Paris. In the post-war era, he became a prominent Athens lawyer, and was closely associated with Georgios Papandreou, the leader of the Liberal Party and later of the Centre Union. During the ASPIDA scandal of 1965, he was defence attorney to the Georgios Papandreou's son, Andreas Papandreou. During the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, Koutsogiorgas participated in attempts to organize armed resistance against the regime as early as 1967, and was arrested and imprisoned after arms and radio transmitters were discovered at his home. He was later released, but re-arrested in 1970 and held for a while, undergoing interrogation by the infamous EAT-ESA.  Political career  As a close associate of Andreas Papandreou, Koutsogiorgas became a founding member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) during the metapolitefsi. He was elected Member of Parliament in the first national election that took place in November 1974 after the fall of the military government. He held a parliament seat for the prefecture of Achaea in all successive national elections until 1989. In the first PASOK cabinet, Koutsogiorgas was appointed Minister to the Presidency of the Government on 21 October 1981, a post he held until 17 January 1984, when he was named Minister for the Interior. He held the post until resigning on 9 May 1985 before the parliamentary elections, with the exception of the period 22 May – 21 June 1984, when he was replaced by an acting minister for the European Parliament election. During this time he played a major role in the March 1985 political crisis over the issue of the re-nomination of then-President of Greece Constantine Karamanlis for a second term. Papandreou had promised it several times, but the PASOK party base and Koutsogiorgas himself fiercely opposed it. Eventually, largely through Koutsogiorgas insistence PASOK proposed the judge Christos Sartzetakis for the post. Following PASOK's electoral victory in the 1985 election, Koutsogiorgas was re-appointed Interior Minister on 5 June 1985. In the reshuffle of 26 July 1985, he assumed the Public Order portfolio as well, keeping it until 25 April 1986. He remained Interior Minister until 5 February 1987, and on 23 September 1987, he was appointed Vice-President of the Government and Minister for Justice. While popular with the broader PASOK electorate but lacking a strong party base, this appointment made him the de facto number two in the government. During Papandreou's illness in 1988 and his absence from Greece in August–September for a heart bypass operation in the United Kingdom Koutsogiorgas functioned as the virtual Prime Minister. At the same time however, he came under increasing criticism from the press and from within PASOK for his handling of the George Koskotas and his Bank of Crete scandal, in particular over a bank secrecy law that according to some critics would allow Koskotas to evade scrutiny. He continued to enjoy the support of Papandreou: although he was forced to quit the posts of Vice-President of the Government and Justice Minister on 18 November 1988, he was re-appointed as Minister to the Presidency of the Government. The mounting crisis peaked in March 1989, when audio tapes of conversations between Koskotas's wife and an associate of Koskotas (I.Matzouranis) were released by Koskotas who was already a fugitive and imprisoned in the US. The tapes purported to show that Koutsogiogras had received 2 million US dollars in a Swiss bank account for \\"tailoring\\" the bank secrecy law for Koskotas. Koutsogiorgas, denied these claims and accused Koskotas for attempting to blackmail the government at a time he was a fugitive from Greek law and government actions caused his fraudulent empire to crumble. Papandreou survived a vote of confidence in parliament, but Koutsogiorgas submitted his resignation on 16 March 1989. The subsequent investigation showed that a close associate of Koskotas, I. Matzouranis, which used to be a member of the PASOK government and was connected with Koutsogiorgas had mediated in the fall of 1988 to open a bank account for Koutsogiorgas in Switzerland. After a couple of weeks he made a deposit of $1,2 million in that account. A few weeks later, Koutsogiorgas aware of the deposit turned the funds back to Matzouranis and closed the account. When those events were revealed in March 1989 Matzouranis claimed Koutsogiorgas was expecting the deposit. Koutsogiorgas claimed that the account was opened for personal reasons and that the specific deposit was an attempt to get him entrapped by Koskotas and Matzouranis at a critical juncture of the Koskotas case when his illegal activities were exposed. The details of these events remained unexamined as Koutsogiorgas lost his life while defending himself during the proceedings in court.[ Εφημερίδα Ελευθεροτυπία 23/3/89][Εφημερίδα Το Ποντίκι 3/9/90] On 18 May, the PASOK Central Committee voted against him standing as a candidate during the June 1989 parliamentary elections until the investigation on the Bank of Crete case was complete. On 27 September, in a Parliament vote Koutsogiorgas along with Andreas Papandreou, Dimitris Tsovolas and Giorgos Petsos were sent to a Special Tribunal set up to investigate the Koskotas scandal. In a move that at the time was criticized as politicized and excessive, the 68-year-old Koutsogiorgas, alone among the accused, was placed into pre-trial custody at Korydallos prison on 2 October 1990. The move was supported by the new Mitsotakis (ND) government who had been elected just a few months before on a ticket of battling alleged corruption by the Socialist party. Koutsogiorgas immediately appealed this decision, taking his case to the Athens Appellate Court's Appeals Council; his appeal was successful, and he was released from pre-trial detention and set free on 10 January 1991.Η Καθημερινή, 11 Ιανουαρίου 1991, «Ελεύθερος με εγγύηση ο Μένιος The trial began in a heavily politicized atmosphere on 11 March 1991, broadcast on live television. Koutsogiorgas stood his ground and his examination of prosecution witness Ioannis Kamaras (chief auditor of the Bank of Greece) exposed many flaws in the prosecution's case.Τα Νέα, 22 Απριλίου 1991 On 11 April, while examining a witness (Stathis Papageorgiou, former Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece), Koutsogiorgas collapsed in the courtroom and died seven days later. His funeral gathered large crowds in the center of Athens and developed into a political protest against the continuing proceedings of the Special Tribunal. The later was seen by a large part of the press and the population as politically motivated and a result of partisan politics.  Family  Menios Koutsogiorgas was married to Aliki Koutsogiorga and had three children. His brother, Praxitelis (Telis) Koutsogiorgas was a General of the Greek Gendarmerie.

Noted for his facility with languages, Islamic scholarship and contributions to the completion All Saints Memorial Church in Peshawar. Early years and education Born in the hamlet of Henley, near Ludlow, Shropshire, England, son of miller, Thomas Hughes. The Hughes family consisting of two children and their parents lived with Thomas Hughes Sr.'s mother in a house in Ludlow. Thomas Hughes Sr. died when Thomas Patrick Hughes was ten years old. Hughes' family was not wealthy, yet his godfather, Thomas Massey, was willing and able to pay for his way through Ludlow Grammar School. In subsequent years Hughes went to work at Messrs S. and J. Watts Co. in Manchester as a salesperson. While in Manchester he was involved with the Sunday School as a teacher and Superintendent at St. Ann's Church. During this time he applied to the CMS for the position of deacon and missionary. He was accepted into the Church Missionary Society College,Islington and in 1862 commenced his studies there. In 1864 his studies at Islington were complete and he was ordained deacon on 24 July in the Islington College Chapel. Although this was the extent of his formal education he was awarded a number of honorary titles later in his career on the merit of his astounding literary accomplishments. Bachelor of Divinity and Doctor of Divinity were bestowed upon him by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1876 and 1886, respectively. He also received from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland the LLD in 1897. Family At the age of 26, Hughes married Eliza Lloyd on 17 August 1864 at Manchester Cathedral; Canon Bardsley of St. Ann's Church officiated. Their marriage was held shortly (less than a month) after his ordination as a deacon with the CMS. Together the couple left for the mission field 12 September 1864. While on the mission field, they had eight children, six of whom survived infancy. The two that died early on, Minnie and Alice, were first born of the eight and did not make it past the age of three. Infant mortality was not uncommon in Peshawar for there were consistently recurring bouts of cholera and other illnesses. The surviving children lived for a few years with their parents at Peshawar before being sent to England at age three, in part to avoid losing them also to illness. Hughes was often separated from his family, as they were in England for a good part of their lives, but also because of the nature of his work – since he frequently was in his office, visiting in the Hujra, or on preaching journeys throughout the countryside surrounding Peshawar. Missionary work Hughes and his wife originally set out for China; however they never made it there and were instead posted in a city on the Indian frontier, Peshawar, where they remained for twenty years. =Itinerant Preaching= Although posted in the city, Hughes had a passion for those in the rural areas around Peshawar. He would go to the villages, sending a delegation ahead of him to let the leaders know he was coming, and meet with the Imam(s) and the people to talk about the Christian and Islamic faiths. =Hujra= Hughes recognised that traditional hospitality was very important to the Afghans. In lieu of this he had a hujra built at the mission compound in Peshawar. A Hujra is a guest house common in larger houses in Northern India and Pakistan typically where male guests are entertained and community meetings are held. The hujra furnished for guests by Hughes played a key role in his ministry, as many came as guests and talked with him openly in this familiar context. After Hughes left Peshawar, his co-worker, Rev. Worthington Jukes, made an addition to the Hujra at Peshawar to accommodate more guests. =All Saint's Memorial Church= A great feat accomplished in part by Hughes, was the completion of All Saints Memorial Church in Peshawar. It was erected for the use of the native Christians in memory of those who gave their lives for the spread of the Christian gospel in the Peshawar vicinity. He was a leading visionary on the construction of the church, and also played a vital role in the fundraising of the means to build it. Among many other features, there are inscribed the names of those who died during the work at Peshawar. Included among these names are those of Hughes' infant daughters who died. Hughes believed that the most effective way to minister to the people around him was to adapt to their culture. So he set aside his British attire and adopted the dress of the Afghans. He also mastered their language to be able to converse with ease. Additionally, he employed an Afghan man, familiar with the customs of his people, to host in the hujra. His method of acculturation also carried over to All Saint's Church. Since the church was to be for the native people, he made it in their style. The edifice is similar to a mosque in that there are domes and minarets rather than steeples. The interior utilised local materials, designs and special handiwork, in accordance with Hughes' philosophy and practice. After Peshawar In 1884 after 20 years of service in Peshawar, Hughes returned to England in an attempt to find a new ministry position and be reunited with his four children not resident in Peshawar. When he was unable to find a suitable parish in England he made the decision to emigrate to the United States. He departed on 21 May 1884, and his wife and 5 oldest children joined him in 1888. Their youngest son, Sidney, remained in England to finish his schooling. In the United States he worked in churches at Lebanon Springs, New York and between 1889 and 1902 at the Church of the Resurrection (at that time called the Church of the Holy Sepulchre) located at East 74th Street in Manhattan. Although the case was withdrawn by the alleged victim's lawyer as a probable blackmail attempt and dismissed by the assigned magistrate prior to trial, Hughes was the subject of a legal summons in June 1896 accused of assaulting a minor in his study at the church. Retiring from the ministry in 1902, he continued his prolific writing until his death. Thomas Patrick Hughes died aged 73 on 8 August 1911 at his home in Kings Park, Long Island. Literary accomplishments Hughes wrote extensively during his lifetime. His most notable works include: * and *the official government textbook for learning Pashto.

It is endemic to New Zealand.  Taxonomy  This species was described by Edward Meyrick in 1907 using material collected by Alfred Philpott in Invercargill. In 1922 Meyrick classified Heterocrossa as a synonym of the genus Carposina. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species under the name Carposina iophaea in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. In 1978 Elwood Zimmerman argued that the genus Heterocrassa should not be a synonym of Carposina as the genitalia of the species within the genus Heterocrassa are distinctive. In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species back to the genus Heterocrossa. He also synonymised Heterocrossa thalamota with Heterocrossa iophaea. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  This species was described by Meyrick as follows:  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. As well as the type locality of Invercargill, this species has also occurred in Wyndham, in the Peel Forest in Canterbury, Waiho Gorge in Westland, and Puhi Puhi in Marlborough. Specimens have also been collected in the North Island in locations such as at Whakapapa, Whangarei, Hawkes Bay, Waimarino in the Bay of Plenty region and Price's Bush in the Tararua Range.  Biology and behaviour  This species is on the wing between October and February. The adult moths rest on the trunks of trees or alternatively hide among the twigs and leaves on the ground. The manner in which the adult moth folds its wings assists it in finding hiding places. The adult moths are attracted to light. They have also been collected through the beating of bush.  Habitat and host species  Mataī tree – host plant of Heterocrossa iophaea larvae This species is found in native forest habitat. The larvae feed on the immature seeds of the mataī tree, Prumnopitys taxifolia. As the seeds mature the larvae switch to eating the sugar-rich outer wall tissues of the seed before pupating.

Early years In 1994, Sjaka self-published his first novellette Viva Dada! under the name Jan Afganistan.(Die Suid-Afrikaan) Antjie Krog described it as ‘a book about this, that and everything' (Die Suid-Afrikaan). Viva Dada! later inspired Koos Kombuis’s Ronde Roman.(Koos A. Kombuis, O Ronde Roman, Beeld Plus)]  Writer  In 1996, he self-published Christ Spiders Like a Coacaroach (sic) in English and Terpentyn Canves (sic) in Afrikaans (publications). These two books of poetry appeared under the name Shaka September. His work is influenced by Punk, Dada, Abject Art and the Beats. He has become known for his unsettling happenings, cut-‘n’-paste magazines and self-published books of poetry. He has been described as a \\"contemporary literary terrorist\\".V Pseudonyms and identities The name Sjaka S. Septembir is a constructed identity created by pairing up the name of the Zulu warrior king Shaka Zulu with the Cape coloured surname, Coloured. It is a controversial term, referring to a predominantly Afrikaans people whose roots can be traced back to Creole and Dutch ancestry. The slave trade at the Cape was the vehicle that brought these peoples together and resulted in what is commonly (and controversially) referred to as Coloured people. It is a prevalent surname in the Western Cape – but in this context it is spelt September.(:33MA Thesis) The initial \\"S\\" in Sjaka S. Septembir functions as a mask or a chameleon that is free to take on any word that starts with \\"S\\", e.g. Sjaka Shagwell Septembir.(Huppelvlieg, Steinmair) Other identities arise from it, including Dr. Adam Chaos, Diamandt Wolf and Jan Afganistan.(Klyen, Porsel(y)ein(n)kas:16, MA, Steinmar) Porselynnkas Septembir was a founding member of the art movement Porselynnkas in 1996.Cape Argus. Theatre: Clowning around with History. Tonight, Thursday, May 17, 2001 Porselynnkas was made up of artists, writers and performers situated in Stellenbosch between 1996-1999. Other members included Floyed de Vaal as Sigmunt Floyed, Alex Omega, Jaap Ysbeert, Willem Mulder, Vuyo, Asha Zero and Naomie Smit. The name Porselynnkas comes from the Afrikaans idiom ‘Daar’s ‘n aap in die porseleinkas’ that translates to ‘There’s a bull in the china shop’). Porselynnkas was a ground breaking movement, especially in Afrikaans literature and drama. The movement references aspects of Anarchy, Dada and experimental poetry in a way which has never before been seen in a South African context. After the formation of Porselynnkas he changed his name to Sjaka S. Septembir. The publication of student newspaper Die Matie with Sjaka on the front cover was met with extreme resistance. In a period of two years, Porselynnkas performed 38 Dadaist style Poetry Happenings and edpublish 22 publications under Porselynnkas publishers. Their Afrikaans poetry and performances got them banned in many venues in Stellenbosch, from appearing on the student radio station Radio Matie and booed off stage in Cape Town. The performances made use of abjection and shock value to mock religion and norms around sexuality. The group also performed public executions of Afrikaans icons such as Johan Stemmet, Steve Hofmeyr and Patricia Lewis.(Die Burger. Elke Maandag. 9 September 1998) Writer and filmmaker Matthew Kalil made a Porselynnkas documentary called Porselynnkas: Dokiementer, which premiered on 12 June 2011. Cybervaseline Sjaka and the artist Asha Zero met in Johannesburg in 1999 and started a collaboration called Cybervaseline.(Asha Zero) This zine showcased artists such as Swart Steep and Nadine Botha.(David) Cybervaseline was published until the end of 2002 and 18 editions appeared. Only 300 numbered copies of each edition were made.(David Robert Louise/ Asha Zero) Poetry Sjaka writes poetry both in English and Afrikaans. His poetry was featured in the publication A Look Away. Current work Sjaka appeared in Spyt in 2011, written by Ingrid Winterbach. He translated Ouma into English and is taking Red to the National Arts Festival in June 2011.

She was the first ironclad built in Germany; all previous German ironclads had been built in foreign shipyards. She was named after the Hanseatic League, known in Germany simply as Hanse, Latinized Hansa. The ship was launched in October 1872 and commissioned into the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) in May 1875. Designed for overseas service, Hansa was classed as an armored corvette and armed with eight guns in a central battery. Hansa served abroad for the first nine years of her career in the German navy. In 1884, it was found that her iron hull was badly corroded, which rendered the ship unfit for further active service. She was therefore removed from active duty and used for a variety of secondary roles. From 1884 to 1888, she served as a guard ship in Kiel, where she also trained engine and boiler room personnel. In 1888, she was stricken from the naval register and used as a barracks ship in Kiel. She was moved to Mönkeberg in 1905, where she continued to train boiler room personnel, until 1906 when she was sold to ship-breakers and dismantled for scrap.  Design  Development of a small armored corvette began in 1861, shortly after the first ironclad warships entered service in the British and French fleets. The Prussians initially envisioned using the armored vessel to reduce coastal fortifications, as the French ironclad floating batteries had done at the Battle of Kinburn in 1855. Work on the concept proceeded slowly, and the Prussians initially purchased as series of ironclads from British and French shipyards. The design evolved over this period, eventually settling on a casemate ship similar to the British Edward Reed-designed . = General characteristics and machinery = Line-drawing of SMS Hansa Hansa was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ship was designed to displace at a normal loading, and up to with a combat load. The ship's hull was formed with transverse iron frames and mixed iron and timber construction. The underwater portion of the hull was plated with copper to reduce fouling. It contained six watertight compartments. The German navy found the ship to be very stiff in her sea-keeping qualities. Hansa was very maneuverable and was easily controlled while under sail; under steam the ship remained highly maneuverable but control suffered. The ship's crew numbered 28 officers and 371 enlisted men. She carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy. The ship also carried an unknown number of picket boats and barges. Anti-torpedo nets were briefly fitted to the ship from 1885 to 1888. Hansa was powered by a single horizontal three-cylinder single-expansion steam engine built by AG Vulcan in Stettin. The engine drove a single three- bladed screw that was in diameter. Steam, at a pressure of at , was supplied by four trunk boilers in a single boiler room. The boilers were ducted into a single large funnel that could be retracted when the ship was operated under sail. The powerplant was rated at 450 nominal horsepower with a top speed of . On trials, her propulsion system managed and . The ship carried of coal for the boilers, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Hansa was fully rigged, and had a sail area of . Steering was controlled by a single rudder. = Armament and armor = Hansa was armed with eight L/19 hooped guns, each of which was provided with 110 rounds of ammunition. The guns were placed in a two-story arrangement amidships; four were mounted in a broadside casemate, two on either side of the ship. The other four guns were mounted in casemates on the corners of the lower casemate, which gave the ship a degree of end-on fire capability. The lower guns could depress to −5° and elevate to 13°; at maximum elevation, the guns could reach targets out to . The upper guns had a wider range of elevation; they could depress to −8° and elevate to 14°. At maximum elevation, the guns had a range of . Hansas armor consisted of teak-backed wrought iron, which was manufactured in Great Britain. Her armored belt was thick amidships, where it protected the ship's vitals. On the bow and stern, the belt was reduced to in thickness. The entire belt was backed with of timber. The casemates were armored with 114 mm thick sloping iron plates. The lower battery casemate had 114 mm thick transverse armored bulkheads on either end of the side armor.  Service history  Hansa was laid down at the Royal Dockyard in Danzig in 1868. She was the first ironclad warship to be built in a German shipyard; her predecessors had all been built in French and British shipyards. The ship was launched on 26 October 1872 and moved to the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin for fitting out work in August 1873. This was completed in December 1874, and the ship was then towed to Kiel on 3 January 1875, where she was taken into a floating dry dock for final fitting-out. Hansa was finally commissioned into the German fleet on 19 May, two and a half years after her launch. By comparison, all of the earlier foreign-built ironclads were completed in less than a year after their launching; the delays with Hansa were largely the result of the inexperience of the shipyards with building ironclad warships. Through the 1870s, the German armored fleet typically saw active service during the summer months. Over the winter, most of the vessels were placed in reserve with one or two kept in a state of reduced commission as guard ships. Hansa joined the summer training squadron for 1875 on 3 June; the unit also included the ironclads , , and . The ships remained in German waters and Hansa was again decommissioned following the end of the cruise in late summer. She remained out of commission until July 1878 when she returned to service for a deployment to the West Indies later that year. She arrived in the area in January 1879 and toured various ports; later that year she moved to South America to protect German nationals during the War of the Pacific between Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. She stopped in Brazil on the way before arriving in Callao, Peru on 8 September. She cruised off the Peruvian and Chilean coast through June 1880. Having returned to Germany in late 1880, she was decommissioned in November for a refit that lasted until February 1884. It was found that her hull was badly corroded; this stemmed from the lengthy construction period, during which the iron had already begun to corrode. As a result of the poor shape of her hull, Hansa was removed from active service in 1884 and used as a guard ship in Kiel. She nevertheless joined the training squadron in 1885, along with Friedrich Carl and the new ironclad . She remained in active service the following year, assigned to II Division of the training squadron, along with four screw corvettes. While in Kiel, she was also used as a training ship for engine-room personnel and stokers. She was activated in June 1887 for the ceremonies marking the beginning of work on the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal that was to link Kiel on the Baltic Sea with the North Sea. She was formally stricken from the naval register on 6 August 1888, by which time her hull had deteriorated further and she was no longer capable of going to sea. She was then used as a floating barracks in Kiel, until 1905. Hansa was then moved to Mönkeberg, hulked, and used to train stokers. The ship did not last long in this service, and was sold in March 1906 for 96,000 marks. Hansa was broken up later that year in Swinemünde.

Lightstone, A. H. and Robinson, Abraham. North-Holland Pub. Co. (Amsterdam and New York), 1975.

He was a professor of mathematics at Carleton University and Queen's University.Queen's University Academic Calendar, Mathematics and Statistics , retrieved 2011-03-31. Research =Decimal hyperreals= In his article \\"Infinitesimals\\" in the American Mathematical Monthly in 1972, Lightstone described an extended decimal notation for the hyperreals. Here there is a digit at every hypernatural rank rather than merely a digit for every rank given by a natural number. Such a hyperreal decimal is written as :a.a_1 a_2 ldots ; ldots a_{H-1} a_H a_{H+1} ldots,. Here the digit a_H appears at rank H, which is a typical infinite hypernatural. The semicolon separates the digits at finite ranks from the digits at infinite ranks. Thus, the number 0.000...;...01, with digit \\"1\\" at infinite rank H, corresponds to the infinitesimal 10^{-H}. The difference 1 - 0.000...;...01 is 0.999...;...9, with an infinite hypernatural's worth of digits 9. An alternative notation for the latter is :0.underbrace{999ldots9 }_H , where H is an infinite hypernatural. The extended decimal notation provides a rigorous mathematical implementation of student intuitions of an infinitesimal of the form 0.000...01. Such student intuitions and their usefulness in the learning of infinitesimal calculus were analyzed in a 2010 study by Robert Ely in the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education.. This article is a field study involving a student who developed a Leibnizian-style theory of infinitesimals to help her understand calculus, and in particular to account for falling short of 1 by an infinitesimal =Other research= Lightstone's main research contributions were in non-standard analysis.

This is a textbook on the calculus of real functions of a single variable. Reviewer D. R. Dickinson wrote that it \\"contains much novel and interesting material\\"; however, he also complained of its pedantic avoidance of variables (using identity functions in their place), its unnecessary insistence on considering only functions whose derivative has the same domain as the function itself, and its \\"dull and lengthy discussions of elementary topics\\".Review of Concepts of Calculus by D.

As well as covering the title topics, it also contains a long section on the axioms for several algebraic structures: groups, rings, fields, and Boolean algebras. One idiosyncrasy is that, rather than axiomatizing the real numbers using Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences, it bases its axiomatization on sequences of decimal numbers. *Nonarchimedean Fields and Asymptotic Expansions (with Abraham Robinson, North-Holland, 1975). 2016 pbk reprint.

Described by one national newspaper in the UK as \\"a bearded 30-something one-man cottage industry\\", he is signed to the Brighton-based Skint Records – the home of Fatboy Slim, aka Norman Cook. McGregor has released one album on Skint, \\"Going Up\\", and his second long-player \\"Hotel Radio\\" is scheduled for release in the summer of 2011. His track \\"Under The Sun\\" was used in Bacardi's worldwide TV advertising campaign, and other singles from his debut sample-based album such as \\"Strong Together\\" have made the charts in several European countries including Italy, Belgium and Holland, and has recently been licensed to Ultra Records in America. In addition to being a recording artist and DJ, Kidda is an animator and video director and has made music promos for assorted artists such as Midfield General, the Lo- Fidelity Allstars, X-Press 2 and Phil Kieran – as well as completing animation work for the stage shows of US artists Kanye West and Rihanna. McGregor also sewed his own tapestry to make up the artwork for his 2008-released album \\"Going Up\\". Born and raised in Middlesbrough in the north-east of England, McGregor moved to Nottingham in the Midlands region of the UK to study fine art. In his spare time he began to craft hip-hop beats, and after completing an MA in animation back in Middlesbrough he moved to Brighton on the south coast of England. He moved into a house with Skint Records artist Danielsan, and was soon invited to make a promo video for Danielsan's \\"Force Ten\\" single. This led to more video work with other Skint Records artists, and after a couple of EPs for the Brighton-based Catskills Records in the mid-2000s (decade) – \\"The Shoe Cash EP\\" and \\"The Word Booty EP\\" – he signed to Skint as a recording artist. Kidda's debut album featured Gary Lightbody from indie band Snow Patrol (on \\"Shining 1\\") and various other vocalists, and was notable for being constructed from samples that were then all re-recorded. First single from the album, \\"Smile\\", used the theme tune from BBC sports show Ski Sunday, while \\"Under The Sun\\" contained elements of a song written by US songwriters Ashford and Simpson. A section of the single was used in a Bacardi worldwide TV advertising campaign, although most of the money the spirits company paid for its use went to Ashford and Simpson's publishers EMI. The \\"Going Up\\" album received favourable reviews in most music publications. \\"With infectious hooks, tasty beats and soul-tinged melodies, Kidda’s debut feels like the natural sequel to The Avalanches' universally acclaimed 'Since I Left You',” said MOJO magazine. It was awarded album of the month status in DJ magazine, album of the week in DMC Update, while BBC Music said: \\"Somewhere between funk, pop, hip-hop and old skool rave, 'Going Up' is the perfect soundtrack to this summer's festivals\\". However, the same review went on to say: \\"While Going Up's blatant and intended cheesiness appeals to this particular scribe, more straight-laced musos may find it all a bit too camp and annoying. Basically Kidda's a bit like Marmite; you'll either love him or hate him.\\" The NME, meanwhile, said: \\"Like airy muzak in a shopping centre, most of 'Going Up' washes over you.\\" The remix of \\"Under The Sun\\" by British producer Hervé was a club hit supported by the likes of BBC Radio One's Annie Mac and Kissy Sellout and was subsequently licensed to a number of compilations, including Ministry of Sound's \\"The Annual 2009\\" and Godskitchen \\"Anthems 2009\\". \\"Strong Together\\" was also used on a TV ad for Warner Leisure. Second album \\"Hotel Radio\\" is thought to have a more pop-orientated feel, and contain no samples whatsoever – it's purported to be all original songwriting from Kidda and his co-writer Lee Muddy Baker. McGregor is also thought to be preparing a live show to support the release of \\"Hotel Radio\\".

Sundarrajan. The film stars Vijayakanth and Revathi as two villagers, Vellaisamy and Vaidehi, whose lives undergo a drastic turn when they meet. They discover that they must join forces to save a young couple from the wrath of the other villagers. Vaidehi Kaathirundhals story was developed based on songs that Ilaiyaraaja had composed, hoping to use them in potential film. The film was released on 23 October 1984, became a huge commercial success and emerged a breakthrough in Vijayakanth's career. It was remade in Telugu as Manchi Manasulu (1986), and in Kannada as Preethi Nee Illade Naa Hegirali (2004).  Plot  Vellaisamy is an unkempt derelict who lives by the village temple doing menial jobs to survive but has an impressive singing ability. Vaidehi is a young widow who lives in the village with her sorrowing, alcoholic father. Minutes after Vaidehi's marriage, the groom and his parents died in a boat accident. This led to the village ostracising her and not letting her practice dance, which she was talented in. Her father, though rich, took to drinking upon seeing his daughter's fate. One day when some villagers spot Vellaisamy scribbling Vaidehi's name on the temple walls, rumours about them start circling. When a distressed Vaidehi approaches and questions Vellaisamy why he has been writing her name of walls, he reveals his tragic past and how he lost the woman of his affection, also named Vaidehi. Vellaisamy and his widowed mother lived in another village. His cousin Vaidehi, who was also brought up with him, had high hopes of marrying Vellaisamy. Despite being in love with Vaidehi, Vellaisamy neglected her for fun. After buying wedding jewels for Vaidehi, he played a final prank on her, by telling her that he has been engaged with someone else. Distraught, Vaidehi ate poisonous seeds, and died in Vellaisamy's arms. Within weeks, Vellaisamy's mother also died. Vellaisamy gave his properties to poor people, and moved to his present village for closure. Vellaisamy and Vaidehi now share a mutual respect for each other's melancholic lives but soon realise they need to work together to unite Nataraj and Sengamalam, a young couple in love, against the wrath of the whole village, particularly Sengamalam's ruthless brother Vellikizhamai Ramasamy. Vellaisamy is killed by Ramasamy's goons in the melee, and the young lovers are united, while Vaidehi is left alone.

S. Raghavendar as the widow Vaidehi's father * Radha Ravi as Vellikizhamai Ramasamy  Production  After music director Ilaiyaraaja finished composing the songs of Kaakki Sattai (1985) in half-a-day, well before the three-day schedule, he started to compose other songs since he was free at that time; he ended up composing six songs, hoping to use them in a potential film. Producer-lyricist Panchu Arunachalam, who used to listen to Ilaiyaraaja's unused songs and pick any of them he liked for future projects, wanted one of the six tunes for the film that would become Vaidehi Kathirunthal. But Ilaiyaraaja insisted that he listen to all six tunes; the producer did so, and the storyline of Vaidehi Kathirunthal was developed based on them. The film was written and directed by R. Sundarrajan, and produced by Thooyavan under the banner Appu Movies, while Arunachalam was credited as presenter. Cinematography was handled by Raja Rajan, and editing by M. Shrinivasan and B. Krishnakumar. Vijayakanth agreed to play a \\"soft role\\" at a time when he starred in many action films and was branded an action hero. This was the Tamil debut of Kannada actress Pramila Joshai (credited as Parimalam), and the feature film debut of T. S. Raghavendra (credited as Raghavendar) and Sivankumar. Shooting took place predominantly at the banks of Kanchima River.  Soundtrack  The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The song \\"Kaathirunthu\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Shivaranjani, \\"Azhagu Malaraada\\" is set in Chandrakauns, and \\"Inraiku Yen Indha\\" is set in Abhogi. The song \\"Rasathi Unna\\" is inspired from the song \\"Singara Punnagai\\" from the film Mahadhevi (1957) composed by M. S. Viswanathan. For every day the film played at a theatre in Cumbum, \\"Rasathi Unna\\" attracted the attention of wild elephants which came near the theatre and remained till the song ended before returning to the forest. P. Jayachandran, the singer of this song, \\"Kaathirunthu\\" and \\"Inraiku Yen Indha\\", said all three songs were recorded within a day.  Release and reception  Vaidehi Kaathirundhal was released on 23 October 1984, Diwali day. The Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, in its issue dated 2 December 1984, carried the reviews of multiple people who had seen the film. The review board of the magazine gave the film a rating of 44 out of 100 based on these reviews, with the consensus being favourable towards Ilaiyaraaja's music and critical towards the multiple storylines stitched together. Despite facing competition from other Diwali releases such as Nallavanukku Nallavan and the Tamil-dubbed version of the Malayalam-language My Dear Kuttichathan, the film was a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres.  Remakes  Vaidehi Kaathirundhal was remade in Telugu as Manchi Manasulu (1986), and in Kannada as Preethi Nee Illade Naa Hegirali (2004).  Legacy  Vaidehi Kaathirundhal emerged a breakthrough in Vijayakanth's career. According to film journalist Sreedhar Pillai, it was one of the films that made him the \\"Raja of B and C stations\\" The waterfalls where the film was shot was renamed Vaideki Falls after the film. The quote \\"Petromax lightey venuma\\" () spoken by Goundamani's character became a popular phrase in Tamil Nadu and refers to someone wanting and persisting on something particular. The quote also inspired a song of the same name in Aranmanai (2014). The Chennai-based brand Dude Thamizha prints T-shirts that carry the dialogue which are their best-sellers too. The character name of Goundamani, All in All Azhagu Raja, was also used as the title a 2013 film, while the 2019 film Petromax derives its title from All in All Azhagu Raja's dialogue.

By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in the upper part of the visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, thereby causing airborne moths to come plummeting downward, and resulting in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source.

Taxonomy  This species was described by Alfred Philpott in 1931 using a specimen collected by Charles E. Clarke at Okoroire in December and named Carposina marginata. Later in 1931 Edward Meyrick, thinking he was describing a new species, named it Paramorpha heptacentra. This name along with the original combination were synonymised by George Hudson in his 1939 book A supplement to the butterflies and moths of New Zealand. Hudson illustrated and described the species under the current nomenclature. The male holotype specimen is held at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.  Description  Philpott described the species as follows:  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. Hudson was of the opinion that the species could be found in the northern parts of the North island. Other than Okoroire, this species has been collected in Whangarei, and at the Poor Knights Islands.  Biology and behaviour  This species is on the wing in December and January. This species has been collected using a malaise trap as well as being beaten from foliage.  Habitat and host species  This moth has been found to be present in the canopy of kanuka stands.

The district incorporates the log entrance arch typical of all Mount Rainier entrances, a log frame ranger station and checking station, a comfort station and miscellaneous service structures, all built around 1926, as well as the 1915 Superintendent's Residence and the 1908 Oscar Brown Cabin, the oldest remaining structure in the park. The buildings in the district conform to the principles of the National Park Service Rustic style that prevailed in park design of the 1920s and 1930s. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 1991. It is part of the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District, which encompasses the entire park and which recognizes the park's inventory of Park Service-designed rustic architecture. Features The Nisqually Entrance Ranger Station was designed by National Park Service architect Daniel R. Hull and built in 1926, replacing the Oscar Brown Cabin as the first point of visitor contact upon entry to the park. The one-story L-shaped log cabin contained an office space and residences for two rangers. The front extension adjoins the road and functions as a checking station for entering cars. The station was featured in Thomas Chalmers Vint's Park and Recreation Structures publication, illustrating the principles of rustic park architecture. It was renovated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers in 1936, with a porte-cochere addition over the inbound traffic lane added in 1937. The porte-cochere's checking booth was destroyed in 1946 by a bus. A new, free-standing booth was built on an island in 1962. Interior renovations in 1937, 1966 and 1973 altered original interior details. The Superintendent's Residence is a 1-1/2 story timber framed structure, built as winter quarters for the park's superintendent. Between 1915 and 1923 the superintendents lived at Longmire in the summer. From 1924 Superintendent O.A. Tomlinson made the Nisqually residence the permanent superintendent's home. It has continued in that use. The house was built by DeWitt Reaburn, and originally measured by with an by porch across the front. An extensive renovation in 1965 added a carport and covered walkway joining it to the house. he original double-hung window sashes were replaced with sliding units and the interior was remodeled. The porch's log posts were replaced with heavy dimension lumber at some point. The Ranger's Residence is a 1-1/2 story frame house in a split-level plan, built in 1915 by the Park Service. The Oscar Brown Cabin was named after its first occupant, a park ranger who was of the first permanent rangers in the park. Built in 1908, the cabin functioned as a checking station for visitors entering the park and was the park's headquarters until 1916. The log house features an elaborate two-story front porch in varying sizes of logs. The upper level features an arched log from which small logs radiate to the roof gable, forming a sort of sunburst screen. A small lean-to bay was added in 1909, with another addition to the rear in 1910 that may have functioned as the superintendent's office. The cabin was the superintendent's winter quarters until 1915. Other buildings in the district include an equipment building and men's and women's comfort stations (1927).

His responsibility for investigating sudden deaths as an independent judicial officer saw him preside over numerous notable cases. He was made a Deputy Lieutenant of Greater London in 2008 and advanced to the representative Deputy Lieutenant for Westminster in 2013. Early life Paul Knapman went to Epsom College, Surrey, King's College London, and St George's Hospital Medical School, London, where he qualified as a doctor – MB, BS (1968). He then proceeded to read for the Bar at the Council of Legal Education, and was called to the Bar as a barrister by Gray's Inn in 1972.

One of his last major cases (October 2010) was presiding over the inquest of the barrister Mark Saunders, controversially shot to death by Metropolitan Police on 6 May 2008. After the ruling of 'lawful killing' Knapman revealed that he would use his powers as coroner to highlight lessons that should be learned by the police for the future and would make copies of his recommendation available to Secretary of State for Justice, Kenneth Clarke. =Sandra Rivett, Nanny to Lord Lucan, 1975= As the Deputy Coroner he was much involved with the preparation of the inquest into the death of Sandra Rivett, nanny to the children of Lord Lucan. He sat with the coroner during the inquest (16–19 November June 1975), when the jury returned the verdict that Lord Lucan should stand trial at The Old Bailey charged with the murder of Sandra Rivett. Lord Lucan had disappeared and has never been found. =Georgi Markov, 1978= As Deputy Coroner he was consulted and involved in all stages following the death of Georgi Markov, who died on 11 November 1978. Markov was a Bulgarian working for the BBC World Service and considered a thorn in the side of the Communist authorities. His cause of death was by a pellet probably containing ricin (which was never actually analysed). Although the press and others showed diagrams of the poison's administration by an umbrella, no umbrella was ever found. =Iranian Embassy Siege, 1980= At that time the US Embassy in Tehran was besieged by the Iranian Authorities with the American citizens working in the Embassy having been taken hostage. President Carter sanctioned a rescue by US forces, but the US helicopters unfortunately came down in the desert and the hostage rescue had to be abandoned. Subsequently, the Iranian Embassy in London was seized by six terrorists on 30 April, and they shot one hostage. The Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, handed control of the situation from the Metropolitan Police to the British Army. Then, it being a Bank holiday weekend, in the full blaze of publicity and live television, soldiers of the Special Air Service (SAS) successfully rescued the hostages on 5 May. At the subsequent inquest the jury learnt that during the rescue another hostage was killed by a terrorist and five terrorists were shot and killed by the SAS. One terrorist survived. At the inquest the jury unanimously returned a verdict of justifiable homicide concerning the death of the terrorists. =Libyan Embassy Siege, 1984= On 17 April in 1984 there was a protest demonstration outside the Libyan Embassy in St.James' Square, London. Shots were fired from the Embassy injuring demonstrators and killing WPC Yvonne Fletcher. At the inquest it was shown that the shots came from the first floor of the Embassy and the pathologist Dr. West opined that her fatal injury was consistent with this. The inquest jury concluded she was unlawfully killed. =Clapham Junction rail crash, 1988= On Monday 12 December 1988, just outside Clapham Junction railway station a crowded train from Basingstoke was shunted at speed from behind by a following train from Bournemouth, a third train from London on the adjacent line collided with the wreckage, a fourth train stopped in time. thirty-five people were killed. The site of the crash and the dead were within the jurisdiction of the Coroner for Inner West London and the bodies were taken to an expanded mortuary at Westminster. All the inquests were opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner's Court. The inquests into all 35 people were subsequently held at a special court at Westminster Council House. It started with a very brief outline of the timings and mechanisms of the accident. Then subsequently the Coroner and jury heard the following evidence regarding each of the deceased: an outline of personal details, including character of each person provided by a relative; evidence of how precisely they were identified; an indication of where precisely they were at the time of the collision, assisted by visual aids; and a brief summary of injuries and the cause of death provided by the pathologist. Then, having heard the evidence on each of the 35 people, the Coroner announced he was adjourning the inquest for a Public Enquiry to be held by Anthony Hidden QC who had been appointed for that purpose by The Secretary of State for Transport under regulations of The Railways Act 1871. The cause of the crash was found to be that a wiring fault in signalling mean that the signal would not show red even though the track circuit ahead was occupied by a train. Re-wiring had recently been performed on Clapham Junction A box, and redundant wires had not been cut back and insulated sufficiently causing a false feed. A number of recommendations were made. (Ref: Hidden 1989) Following a prosecution, British Rail were fined £250,000 for a breach of the Health & Safety at Work etc. Act. Knapman concluded it was not necessary to resume the inquests. =Marchioness disaster, 1989= On 20 August 1989 the pleasure boat Marchioness was struck by the dredger Bowbelle on the River Thames in London. This fatal collision resulted in the death of 51 people. Knapman was the coroner, Dr Dolman was deputising as Knapman was out of London at that time. Having returned to London, although not specifically recalling it, Knapman said that had he been asked by the Metropolitan Police he would certainly have given consent for hands to be removed from the decomposed bodies. This was standard practice for all London coroners at the time for any bodies that were badly decomposed (especially by water). During an inquiry into Knapman's actions he stated the hands had been removed for identification purposes in an attempt to get identification of the victims to their families as soon as practically possible. However, subsequently it was determined that at least 12 of the victims who had their hands removed were simultaneously in the process of potential dental identification that might have resulted in identification sooner. Visual identification is not considered reliable in such circumstances and many errors have occurred in the past leading to greater distress. In 1992 Knapman refused to resume the inquest into the victims deaths adding that there had been four inquiries/court proceedings already. In January 1993, mothers of two of the victims, began legal action for judicial review of his decision. In June 1994, after a judicial review, the Court of Appeal heard the appeal. Lord Justice Brown said \\"no-one should interpret this judgement as a condemnation of Knapman, almost without exception he handled the many difficulties he faced not merely with sensitivity but with an evident sympathy for the bereaved families. Understandably, and indeed justifiably riled by an unfair article in The Mail on Sunday he was guilty of but a single intemperate comment\\". Lord Justice Farquharson said \\"the various affidavits and other documents in these proceedings clearly demonstrate that the Coroner was most concerned about the welfare of the bereaved families and he repeatedly consulted them, indeed the lengths he went to showed that his actions went far beyond those normally expected of a Coroner.\\" Sir Thomas Bingham, The Master of the Rolls said, \\"I reach this decision with regret, the Coroner reacted to this horrific tragedy with energy and public spirit. He went to great lengths to treat the bereaved with sympathy and understanding.....the issue for this court is however, the single limited question. Conscious though I am of the great difficulty in which the Coroner was placed, I never the less feel bound to reach the conclusion I have expressed.\\" Knapman and Dolman were stood down and a new coroner was appointed by the High Court and Home Office, Dr John Burton. Burton then held an Inquest into all the Marchioness deaths. In February 2000 Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott announced that he had ordered a Public Enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Marchioness disaster. During a Non-Statutory Inquiry into the Identification of the 51 Victims, overseen by Lord Justice Clarke. Clarke also expressed his concerns over the removal of the hands of the victims. Some of the family members of the victims urged Knapman to resign and stated they would call on the Home Secretary if action was not taken against him. However, Knapman continued to act as coroner for London and Westminster for another 11 years and acted in several high-profile cases. =Ladbroke Grove rail crash, 1999= The Ladbroke Grove Rail crash (also known as The Paddington Rail crash) occurred on 5 October 1999. On that day in the morning, a Thames train to Bedwyn in Wiltshire left Paddington Station and collided head on with a First Great Western train travelling into Paddington from Cheltenham. The combined speed was 130 mph and ignited fuel, caused a fireball and the first carriage of the Cheltenham train was totally burnt out. Both drivers and 29 passengers, a total of 31 people were killed. The site of the crash and the dead came within the jurisdiction of the Coroner for Inner West London and the bodies were taken to an expanded mortuary at Westminster. All the inquests were opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner's Court. The inquests into all 31 dead was subsequently held at a special court at Westminster Council House. Each started with a very brief outline of the timings and mechanism of the accident. The Coroner heard the following evidence regarding each of the deceased: an outline of personal details, including character of each person provided by a relative; an indication of where it was estimated they were at the time of the collision assisted by visual aids; and a brief summary of the injuries and the cause of death (mostly severe burns) was provided by a pathologist. Then, having heard all the evidence a contrivance was shared and announced, that a letter from The Lord Chancellor had just been delivered. The letter requested the Coroner to adjourn the inquest pending the result of a public enquiry conducted by Lord Cullen. This contrivance was as a consequence of legislation passed only a month earlier, whereby the Lord Chancellor could require an inquest to be adjourned and only resumed if the Coroner \\"believes there is exceptional reason for doing so\\". The cause of the crash was found to be the driver of the Thames train from Paddington passing signal SN109 at red, probably due to bad sighting of SN109 and bright sunlight at a low angle, and other factors outlined. There had been previous difficulty with this signal and eight events of \\"signal passed at danger - SPAD\\" in the proceeding six years. Significant other problems surfaced, resulting in the creation of the Rail Safety Standards Board in 2003. In 2004 Thames Trains was fined a record £2,000,000 and were ordered to pay £75,000 in costs. The inquest was not resumed. =7/7 London Bombings, 2005= On 7 July 2005 in the morning four separate suicide bombs exploded at approximately the same time in London. The first suicide bomb exploded on a London Underground train close to Aldgate Station, the second suicide bomb exploded on a London Underground train close to Edgware Road Station, a third suicide bomb exploded on a London Underground Train close to King's Cross/Russell Square Stations. A fourth suicide bomb exploded almost one hour later on a double decker bus at Tavistock Square. It was originally thought there had been six rather than three explosions on the Underground Network as smoke billowed out of both ends of the tunnels. The bus brought the number to seven but this was clarified to four sites later in the day. The number of fatalities were seven at Aldgate, six at Edgware Road, twenty-six at Kings Cross/Russell Square and thirteen at Tavistock Square plus the four suicide bombers themselves making a total number of 56 fatalities. As there were four sites of the bombings it happened that there were two other coroners involved apart from Knapman. He was the \\"Incident\\" or \\"Lead Coroner\\" for the first 10 days until all the bodies had been identified. Knapman then handed over to Dr. Andrew Reid, Coroner for Inner North London, as the Incident Coroner. Unusually, quite apart from the anti-terrorist police, there were three police forces involved namely The Metropolitan Police, The British Transport Police and The City of London Police. A \\"temporary mortuary\\" was set up at The Honourable Artillery Company Headquarters at City Road, London EC1. The challenges were: there had been four sites of the bombs; many thousands of \\"missing persons\\" reported initially; a cosmopolitan city; disrupted bodies; and computer hard and software of 2005. For the first time features of Lord Justice Clark's report \\"identification of victims following Major Transport Accidents\\" were used. This put the Coroner in overall charge, but with a Senior Identification Manager (and Deputy), together with a Mortuary Documentation Officer, from within the police. There was also an \\"Identification Commission\\" chaired by the Coroner to scrutinise all documentation etc. before an identification was absolutely confirmed. Inquests were opened and adjourned by each of the three Coroners. It was considered prudent that all the inquests be transferred to Dr. Knapman at Westminster under the provisions of The Coroners' Act 1988. Subsequently, Dr. Knapman appointed Lady Justice Hallett to be his Assistant Deputy Coroner, and she eventually held inquests into the deaths. =Inquest into Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Al-Fayed, 2007= The death of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr. Dodi Al-Fayed occurred on 31 August 1997 in Paris. The cause was a collision involving the car in which they were both travelling in the Alma tunnel hitting a pillar at speed inside the tunnel. Both bodies were repatriated to London. Due to protracted enquiries and legal difficulties, the delayed inquests into both were opened eventually on 6 January 2004 by Michael Burgess, HM Coroner for Surrey and The Royal Household. Subsequently, he announced he would resign from the cases said to be due to \\"heavy and constant workload\\" on 24 July 2006, and he appointed Lady Butler-Sloss as his deputy. Following court proceedings in the High Court on 2 March 2007, Paul Knapman was appointed Coroner. He appointed Lady Butler-Sloss, a retired Court of Appeal Judge to hear the inquests as his Assistant Deputy Coroner. She resigned on 24 April 2007. On 7 June 2007 Knapman appointed Lord Justice Scott Baker as his Assistant Deputy Coroner to hear the cases. He then held inquests into both Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Al-Fayed which began on 2 October 2007. The jury returned a verdict of \\"unlawful killing\\" implicating the driver Henri Paul and the paparazzi.

Facts The defendants (British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd) supplied the plaintiffs (Underground Electric Railways Co of London Ltd) with turbines which, in breach of contract, were deficient in power. The plaintiffs accepted and used the turbines but reserved their right to claim damages. Later they replaced the turbines with others which were far more efficient than those supplied by the defendants would have been, even if they had complied with the contract. The plaintiffs claimed to recover the cost of the substitute turbines as damages. Judgment The House of Lords held that in assessing the damages for the breach any loss sustained by the plaintiffs had to be balanced against any gain to them arising directly out of the steps they had taken to lessen the consequences of the breach. Although the plaintiffs had not been bound to buy the new machines, having done so the consequential gain in profits and saved expenses had to be brought into account. The savings exceeded the cost of the machines and so the plaintiffs recovered nothing under this head. Giving the leading judgment, Viscount Haldane LC, 688-9, ‘the quantum of damage is a question of fact’. He set out the principles for determining the measure of damages. The duty to mitigate is not to ‘take any step which a reasonable and prudent man would not ordinarily take in the course of his business.’ Only reasonable steps.

He was sometimes known by his second Christian name, Francis, Earl of Huntingdon. Family background Hastings was the youngest of the four sons of Lieutenant-Colonel George Hastings, a great-great-great-great-grandson of Sir Edward Hastings of Leicester Abbey, son of Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon. During the lifetime of Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon, George's elder brother was regarded as heir-presumptive to the earldom, and a marriage was arranged between George and the Earl's younger sister Lady Selina Hastings (daughter of the 9th Earl and his wife Selina). However, Lady Selina died on 12 May 1763, and in 1769 George Hastings married instead Sarah Fowler, daughter of Sir Richard Fowler, 2nd Baronet, of Harnage Grange. The 10th Earl of Huntingdon died on 2 October 1789 and was succeeded in his estates and the baronies of Botreaux, Hungerford, de Moleyns and Hastings by his surviving sister Elizabeth, whose son Francis Rawdon-Hastings was created Marquess of Hastings in 1816. George Hastings' brother the Rev. Theophilus Henry Hastings, though assuming the style of 11th Earl of Huntingdon, took no steps to prove his right to the Earldom, which therefore became dormant. Early career and marriage Hans Francis Hastings entered the Royal Navy in 1793 and was promoted Lieutenant in 1799. He was severely wounded in an action in Quiberon Bay. On 12 May 1803 he married Frances Cobbe, the daughter of the Rev. Richard Chaloner Cobbe, rector of Great Marlow.Author of Thirty sermons: on various subjects, the posthumous works of Richard Chaloner Cobbe, two volumes, 1793 They had four sons: * Francis Theophilus Henry Hastings, later 13th Earl, (31 July 1808 - 13 September 1875), married Elizabeth Anne Power, daughter of Richard Power, and had issue * George Fowler Hastings (28 November 1814 - 21 March 1876), later a Vice-Admiral and CB, married Mathilde Alice Hitchcock and had issue; great-grandparents of actor Patrick Macnee. * Edward Plantagenet Robin Hood Hastings (12 August 1818 - 17 October 1857), married Caroline Sarah Morris and had issue.

Claim to the Earldom For a distant kinsman (6th cousin) of the tenth Earl of Huntingdon, the successful pursuit of a claim to the peerage, which had fallen into abeyance, was an arduous affair which finally succeeded in 1819. A book was written on the subject.Henry Nugent Bell, The Huntingdon Peerage (London: printed for Baldwin, Cradock & Joy, 1820) He was descended from Edward Hastings, the fourth son of Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, as follows: 1.

He returned to his naval career, being promoted Commander on 7 March 1821. He served as Governor of Dominica between 1822 and 1824, and was made Post Captain on 29 May 1824. On 14 August the same year, he took over command of the Hermes class sixth- rate sloop HMS Valorous and sailed her to the West Indies. However, he became seriously ill, relinquished his command, and took a passage home by way of New York. He died at Green Park, Youghal, at the age of 49, and was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Francis Theophilus Henry Hastings. His widow remarried on 26 April 1838 to Colonel Sir Thomas Noel Harris and died on 9 November 1846 in Boulogne, France.

Facts The Co- operative Insurance Society Ltd owned the freehold of a shopping centre and they let the anchor unit to Argyll as a supermarket, for 35 years, starting 1979, with a covenant to ‘keep open the demised premises for retail trade’. In 1995, the store was making a loss and Argyll closed, despite The Co-operative Insurance's protests. The trial judge refused a specific performance order. The Court of Appeal granted an award of specific performance by a majority, because there was considerable difficulty proving a loss suffered and Argyll had acted with ‘unmitigated commercial cynicism’. Argyll appealed. Judgment The House of Lords allowed Argyll’s appeal and said the judge’s exercise of discretion was correct so that no specific performance could be awarded. Setting out reasons, (1) it was settled practice that no order would make someone run a business (2) enormous losses would result from being forced to run a trade (3) framing the order would be hard (4) wasteful litigation over compliance could result (5) it was oppressive to have to run a business under threat of contempt of court (6) it was against the public interest to require a business to be run if compensation was a plausible alternative. Lord Hoffmann said the following. This case could be contrasted with Warner Brothers v. Nelson [Bette Davis] (1936 KB), where the court agreed to enforce a negative personal obligation, an obligation not to work in the film industry but with Warner Bros.

Facts Ruxley agreed to build a swimming pool in Forsyth's garden. The contract specified that the pool would have a diving area seven feet, six inches deep. When constructed, the diving area was only six feet deep. This was still a safe depth for diving and one which did not affect value of the pool. Forsyth was not happy, however, and he brought an action for breach of contract claiming the cost of having a pool demolished and rebuilt (the cost of cure), a sum of £21,540. At first instance the judge rejected the claim for 'cost of cure' damages on the ground that it was an unreasonable claim in the circumstances, but awarded Forsyth 'loss of amenity damages' of £2500. This award was reversed by the Court of Appeal which held that damages should be awarded at the amount required to place Forsyth in the same position as he would have been in had the contract been performed, which in the circumstances was the cost of rebuilding the pool. Ruxley appealed to the House of Lords.Richard S, James D, Ralph C, 'Text, Cases and Materials on Contract Law',(2nd edn, Routledge, 2011) page 581 Judgment The House of Lords allowed the appeal and upheld the judge's award of £2500 for loss of amenity. Lord Mustill said ‘the law must cater for those occasions where the value of the promise to the promisee exceeds the financial enhancement of his position which full performance will secure.’ So ‘consumer surplus’ was recognised in an award for breach of contract. To award them nothing would be to say the promise was illusory, and that was unsatisfactory. But correcting was too expensive, and too much for the loss of Mr Forsyth. It would be contrary to ‘common sense’ and unreasonable. So we must look to ‘the loss truly suffered by the promisee’. Lord Lloyd said that though courts do not care what damages will be used for, the intention of the innocent party for what he does with them may be relevant to the issue of reasonableness in awarding damages.

Such a remedy, which had precedent before the judgment, has since become firmly known as Wrotham Park damages, which are awarded (in lieu of specific performance or an injunction) under the jurisdiction created (powers vested in the court) by s. 2 of the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 (also known as Lord Cairns' Act). Such damages centre on the hypothetical negotiated value for a release of the covenant and which so in turn may look to a share of the profits from the business venture enabled by the breach; the court decided 5% of profits should be made payable. Facts A relatively small housing estate during construction Wrotham Park is an estate for generations owned and lived in by gentry and then nobility including the Earl of Strafford. Outlying portions have been sold off for development, subject to some lay-out restrictions. Potters Bar Urban District Council came to own one desolate triangle of land. They offered it for sale by public auction as freehold building land for 14 houses. Parkside bought the land and built the houses, despite warnings from Wrotham Park Estate's owners that Parkside were violating the lay-out restrictions. When the houses were built, the owners of the Estate brought a claim against Parkside for breach of the restrictive covenant. Judgment Brightman J (as he then was) awarded damages of £2,500 as a substitute for an injunction. The damages were measured as the amount that might reasonably have been demanded by the plaintiff as payment for relaxing the covenant, being 5% of the developer’s anticipated profit. He refused to make an order to demolish the houses built, preferring to award damages under Lord Cairns' Act, saying: Impact The jurisdiction for Wrotham Park damages has been expanded and clarified in subsequent cases, and was summarized by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 2009:, par. 4654; discussed at #Damages awarded are intended to compensate the claimant for the court's decision not to grant relief in the form of an order for specific performance or an injunction. #The court will award an amount of damages which represents the sum that the claimant might reasonably have demanded from the defendant as compensation for allowing it to breach the relevant contractual provision. The court assesses this by reference to a \\"hypothetical negotiation\\" carried out between the parties at the date of breach. #At the \\"hypothetical negotiation\\" both parties are assumed to act reasonably and the fact that the parties would never have reached a deal in reality is irrelevant. #Although these damages are awarded in place of relief e.g. an injunction, it is not a prerequisite to their being awarded that either (i) the claimant applied for the injunction in the case or (ii) there was any prospect of such application succeeding. While founded in land law, Wrotham Park damages have been found to be available in other contexts, such as employment law in the matter of restrictive covenants., discussed in ;Non- applicability where claimant's claim form sought damages for economic damage Limitations on applicability exist.

Seligman (Isaac) Baer (1825–1897) was a masoretic scholar, and an editor of the Hebrew Bible and of the Jewish liturgy. He was born in Mosbach, the northern district of Biebrich, on 18 September 1825 and died at Biebrich-on-the-Rhine in March 1897. Baer commenced his Masoretic studies as early as 1844. He belonged to the school of Wolf Heidenheim, and had in his possession some of Heidenheim's original manuscripts and personal copies of his published works with handwritten marginal notes. Few scholars in the nineteenth century had so intimate an acquaintance with all the details of the Masorah as had Baer, and it was largely due to him that the study of this branch of Hebrew philology was brought to the notice of Biblical critics. His friendship with Franz Delitzsch, who stood sponsor for much of his work, aided him in making known to the world the results of his studies. Baer's monumental edition of the Jewish prayerbook according to the Ashkenazic rite, Seder Avodat Yisrael (Rödelheim, 1868), accompanied by a critical commentary, became the authoritative model for numerous editions published subsequently in the 20th century. His editions of the Jewish liturgy also include Kinnot for the fast of the ninth of Av. He never occupied an academic position, but was content with the office of Hebrew teacher to the Jewish community of Biebrich. In recognition of his services to the Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany, the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred upon him by the University of Leipzig. His edition of the Masoretic Bible was published in cooperation with Delitzsch. The Masoretic Bible of Baer and Delitzsch Baer's collaboration with Delitzsch began with an edition of the Psalms in 1861 (Leipzig, Doerfling und Franke). A second edition was published a few years later (Leipzig, Brockhaus). In the meantime, Baer had conceived the plan of editing anew the books of the entire Hebrew Bible, strictly following the Masoretic tradition. The volumes, with a Latin preface by Delitzsch, appeared (Leipzig, Tauchnitz) in the following order: Genesis, 1869; Isaiah, 1872; Job, 1875; Minor Prophets, 1878; Psalms (together with a treatise \\"Elementa Accentuationis Metricæ\\"), 1880; Proverbs (together with \\"De Primorum Vocabulorum Dagessatione\\"), 1880; Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah (together with \\"Chaldaismi Biblici Adumbratio\\" and a treatise by Friedrich Delitzsch on the Babylonian proper names in these books), were published in 1882; Ezekiel (with \\"Specimen Glossarii Ezechielico-Babylonici\\" by Friedrich Delitzsch), appeared in 1884; followed by the five Megillot, 1886; the book of Chronicles, 1888; Jeremiah, 1890; Joshua and Judges, 1891; and finally Kings, 1895. The last two were edited by Baer alone, Delitzsch having died in 1890. Death prevented Baer from finishing the series. Attached to each volume were a number of Masoretic notes taken from the best editions and manuscripts, variant readings between the Occidentals and Orientals, between Ben Asher and Ben Naphtali, and various other Masoretic lists and enumerations. Criticisms of the work In general, Baer's text has been accepted as representing the Masoretic tradition; even though exception may be taken to his view on individual points or to his too extensive generalization from insufficient manuscript evidence. Christian David Ginsburg, in his introduction to his Masoretic Bible (London, 1897), has criticized a number of these faults with some severity. He points out, among other things, that Baer has indicated the open and closed sections in the Prophets and the Hagiographa, a thing not usually done in Masoretic manuscripts (pp. 10 et seq.); that he has introduced a number of anti- Masoretic pauses (p. 29); that his division of the Sedarim is faulty (p. 41); that he has introduced the dagesh into the first letter of words when the preceding word ends with the same letter (p. 117), as well as the dagesh which follows upon a guttural with silent shewa and a ḥatef-pataḥ under the first of two similar letters (pp. 466, 662), all of which are not warranted by the best manuscripts. The Masoretic notes at the end of Baer's edition are also criticized (p. 92), especially the lists of various readings. Further, the Aramaic paradigms attached to the edition of Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah have also been the subject of criticism on the part of Kautzsch (\\"Grammatik des Biblisch-Aramäischen,\\" p. 23). Many of these faults were due to Baer's inability to consult manuscripts in the large European collections. Other masoretic works Of Baer's separate treatises dealing with the mesorah may be mentioned: *Torat Emet (\\"The True Law\\"; Rödelheim, 1852), on the accentuation of the three poetic books Psalms, Proverbs, and Job. An enlarged edition of this treatise in German, together with Masoretische Uebersichten, was added as an appendix to the first edition of Delitzsch's Commentary on the Psalter (vol. ii., Leipzig, 1860); *Die Methegsetzung, in Merx's Archiv für Wissensch. Erforschung des Alten Testaments (Halle, 1867, i. 55 et seq.; but compare Grätz, \\"Monatsschrift,\\" 1887, p. 483); *his edition (in conjunction with H. L. Strack) of the Diḳduḳe ha-Te'amim of Aaron ben Moses ben Asher (Leipzig, 1879); *his lengthy criticism of Ginsburg's Masora in Z. D. M. G. 743 et seq.; *and his contribution of the mesorah to the Rabbinic Bible, which was to have been published by the Romms in Wilna (1894), a work upon which he spent many years. For his edition of Aaron ben Moses ben Asher's Diḳduḳe ha-Te'amim, Baer made a complete handwritten copy of the masoretic treatises and lists in the Aleppo codex in their entirety, as found in the pages that preceded and followed the biblical text. Some of the material from his copy was adapted and published within Diḳduḳe ha-Te'amim, and the entire copy survived in Baer's personal archive (now found in the Ginsburg collection at the Russian National Library, Moscow). Since the masoretic treatises of the Aleppo codex are now missing, Baer's personal copy allows for a nearly complete reconstruction of the lost material.Baer copied from a direct copy of the Aleppo Codex, which had been commissioned by Abraham Firkovich. For information on Baer's copy and an evaluation of it, as well as for a critical edition of sections from the now-missing masoretic treatises of the Aleppo Codex, see two essays by Yosef Ofer, \\"A Masoretic Note in the Aleppo Codex Concerning the Composite Words,\\" Textus 21 (2002), pp. 209-233; \\"The Masoretic Treatises of the Aleppo Codex according to the copy in the Archives of Isaac Seligman Baer\\" in Iyyunei Miqra u-Parshanut, vol. 7 (2005), pp. 137-162 (Hebrew). By the same author also see \\"M. D. Cassuto's Notes on the Aleppo Codex\\", Sefunot 19 (1989), pp. 277-344 (online text (PDF) in Hebrew), which contains a partial reconstruction of the masoretic material based on Cassuto's notes on the contents of these pages (before Baer's copy was re-discovered). According to Ofer, Baer's full copy and Cassuto's notes complement each other well. Liturgy and other works page=1 What Baer did for the Hebrew Bible, he also tried to do for the Jewish prayerbook. His Seder Avodat Yisrael (\\"Ritual of Israel's Service\\"; Rödelheim, 1868), is accompanied by a literary and philological commentary called Yakhin Lashon (\\"Preparatory Study of Language\\"), which has made the work a standard authority and a model for subsequent Ashkenazic prayerbooks throughout the 20th century and to the present day.Important editions of the Ashkenazic prayerbook from the late 19th century to the present day, which used Baer's Avodat Yisrael as their model, include The Authorized Daily Prayer Book of Singer (1890 and since revised in numerous editions through 2009) and Philip Birnbaum (1949). Attached to it is the text of the Psalms, accurately vocalized and accented.See Kobak's \\"Jeschurun,\\" vi. 217; Berliner, in \\"Israelit,\\" 1868, Nos. 24 and 26). Among Baer's other works may be mentioned: *Leket Tzvi [\\"Collation of Tzvi\\"], Sammlung von Gebeten (Rödelheim, 1855, 1861); *Tikkun haSofer vehaKore (\\"Correct Text for the Scribe and Reader\\"), the Masoretic text of the Pentateuch, together with the laws governing the writing of synagogue scrolls (Rödelheim, 1856); *Divrei haBerit (\\"The Words of the Covenant\\"), on the prayers and observances connected with circumcision (Rödelheim, 1874); *Totzeot Chayyim (\\"Issue of Life\\"), prayers for mourners (ib. 1871); *Zivchei Tzedek (\\"Sacrifices of Righteousness\\") on ritual slaughter (ib. 1876). During the latter part of his life, Baer ventured into the field of history, and translated for the Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany the Hebrew accounts of the persecutions at the time of the Crusades.\\"Quellen zur Geschichte der Juden in Deutschland,\\" ii., Berlin, 1892 The venture was not successful.As Brann has shown in \\"Monatsschrift,\\" xxxvii. 196 et seq., 286 et seq.

History The station was launched on 2 July 1932 and was the second station in Rockhampton - the first being 4RK, now ABC Capricornia. The opening of 4RO resulted in Rockhampton being the first regional town in Queensland, to have two radio stations on the air. Coverage of races and football were among the very first items to be featured on 4RO's earliest transmissions on 2 July 1932. The station was officially opened that night by Rockhampton Mayor, JT Lee. 4RO's first studio was built on the corner of East and Denham Streets in Rockhampton's CBD. The studio was on the second floor of the building. An aerial that strung between two masts on the back of the building was responsible for transmitting a power of 200 watts. In 1953, new transmitters of two kilowatts were built at Pink Lily, on the outskirts of Rockhampton and two years later 4RO moved into new studios in East Street, in a building that became known as Rheuben House. Rheuben House was the home to 4RO until 1970 when a new building designed by architects from Toowoomba were constructed on the corner of Archer Street and Victoria Parade. The Victoria Parade studio was officially opened by Rockhampton Mayor Rex Pilbeam on 18 August 1970. In 1982, 4RO opened a new transmission site at Port Alma, south of Rockhampton, that started transmitting a power of five kilowatts. The old transmitter at Pink Lily is now used by 4RO's Gladstone based sister station 4CC to broadcast their Rockhampton service on 1584 AM. In 1979, 4RO employed a staff of 24 employees.McDonald, Lorna, Rockhampton: A History of City & District, pages 493-494, Second Edition, 1995 In 1996, 4RO was bought by Reg Grundy's RG Capital Radio. After successfully bidding for an FM licence, RG Capital launched an FM radio station in Rockhampton called Sea FM, which was added to RG Capital's existing network of Sea FM stations across Queensland and New South Wales. The new Sea FM studios were set up inside the 4RO building in Victoria Parade. The original intention for the creation of Sea FM was to use it as a sister-station to 4RO enabling the two stations to cater for two different age demographics with 4RO's programming slightly changed for an older audience, while Sea FM offered a more youth orientated format to attract younger listeners. When 4RO welcomed its new sister station, DMG Regional Radio also launched Hot FM. Hot FM was also a youth-orientated station, designed to attract the younger listeners that didn't listen to DMG's AM station in Gladstone, 4CC. Unlike 4CC which had its studio in Gladstone, DMG established the Hot FM studios in Rockhampton to broadcast a local breakfast show and to emphasise the rivalry between the two new FM stations who were both fighting to attract a similar demographic. However, in 2004, RG Capital Radio and DMG Regional Radio merged to form Macquarie Regional RadioWorks, which meant all four local commercial stations found themselves owned by the same company. The merger meant that the newly formed company was required by Australian law to offload two radio stations, due to a legal requirement stipulating that one media company cannot own more than two radio stations in the same market. Macquarie Regional Radioworks eventually offloaded 4RO and 4CC to Prime Media Group. Prime also acquired a number of other regional stations after similar events occurred in other regional radio markets, including Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, and the Sunshine Coast. Despite now under different ownership, 4RO shared the Victoria Parade studios with Sea FM until August 2007, when 4RO moved into the office vacated by Hot FM when they moved their local studio to Gladstone at the beginning of 2005. 4RO's new Quay Street studios, also incorporating a sales office for 4CC, were officially opened by Rockhampton Mayor Margaret Strelow in November 2007. In August 2013 Grant Broadcasters acquired the station and Prime Media's other nine radio stations in Queensland. As a result, the 4RO studio in Rockhampton now serves as a sales office for Grant's KIX Country narrowcasting service. Current Programming =Format= 4RO's slogan is News, Talk and The Music You Love. As the slogan suggests, the station currently has a varied format featuring a variety of talk and music programming. The station's programming is skewed towards an older audience, especially the 45+ demographics. =Shows= The station's breakfast show with Michael J. Bailey, The Laurie Atlas show and the Saturday morning program are the only local shows produced from the Rockhampton studio. The regionally-networked Retro 20/20 Countdown is hosted by Aaron Stevens.20/20 Retro Countdown , 4RO website Retro 20/20 Countdown is heard on 4CA in Cairns,Retro 20/20 Countdown , 4CA website 4MK in Mackay,Retro 20/20 Countdown , 4MK website Gladstone's 4CC,Retro 20/20 Countdown , 4CC website Zinc 96.1 on the Sunshine Coast and River 94.9 Ipswich.Retro 20/20 Countdown , Zinc 96.1 website 4RO also sources some programming from Macquarie Media The Ray Hadley Morning Show, Nights with John Stanley, Roothys Australia, 2GB overnights and 2GB's Continuous Call Team rugby league coverage during the NRL season. =News= Sunshine Coast journalists compile and present news bulletins that air on 4RO during each weekday. The station also uses the Macquarie National News service overnight and on weekends. The news bulletins that air during the breakfast program are a composite of both national and local news. Unlike Sea FM, Hot FM and ABC Capricornia, the station no longer airs bulletins that comprise only of local news stories. Prior to 1998, 4RO had its own local newsroom in Rockhampton staffed with its own journalist. The journalist compiled full local news bulletins that went to air hourly from 6:30am until 1pm, before a pre-recorded bulletin aired at 5pm. In 1998, the newsroom at 4RO was closed when RG Capital transferred 4RO's journalist to the newly established newsroom at Gold FM on the Gold Coast, where the journalist continued to read local bulletins for 4RO but also began presenting national news bulletins for all of RG Capital's networks stations. As part of the Gold Coast arrangement, the 9am, 10am, 11am and 1pm local news bulletins were axed, with local news only being read on 4RO during breakfast, midday and 5pm. Gold Coast-based journalists continued to read local news bulletins for 4RO until Prime Media established its own newsroom on the Sunshine Coast and reduced local news output on 4RO even further, with the composite bulletins mixing local stories amongst national stories, only airing during the breakfast program between 6am and 9am. When 4RO moved out of the building it shared with Sea FM in 2007, Southern Cross Austereo used 4RO's old studio to re-establish a local newsroom to use it for their own stations, Sea FM and Hot FM. Ever since, Southern Cross Austereo has employed a Rockhampton-based journalist to broadcast a local news service similar to what 4RO had prior to 1998. Controversies =Stolen Generations Apology= During a time when Australian Prime Minister John Howard was being called on to formerly apologise to the Stolen Generations, a 4RO listener anonymously sent a letter to the station which took the form of a mock, sarcastic apology entitled Australian Apology to the Aborigines. On 7 April 2000, 4RO breakfast co-presenter Olivia Scott read the \\"apology\\" on air. A complaint was then lodged with the station. The unresolved complaint was then lodged with commercial radio's regulatory body, the Australian Broadcasting Authority prompting an investigation. At the completion of the investigation, the ABA found 4RO had breached clause 1.3(c) of the Commercial Radio Codes of Practice by broadcasting material which was likely to vilify on the basis of race. During the investigation, Olivia Scott was immediately suspended from all on-air duties but was re-instated on 8 May 2000 following the completion of the investigation on the condition that she personally apologise; the Human Rights & Equal Opportunity Commission was contacted by 4RO; an ongoing training program was implemented for all on air staff at 4RO; and at 4RO's instigation, a meeting was held on 2 May 2000 between representatives of Central Queensland's Indigenous community to discuss the issue. Following the investigation, managing director of RG Capital Radio, Rhys Holleran also pre- recorded an apology which was aired at various intervals on 13 April 2000 and 14 April 2000. After satisfying the ABA with the various proactive steps taken by the station following the incident, no action was taken was taken against 4RO despite the breach.Investigation 855, Australian Broadcasting Authority, 16 May 2000 Scott's 4RO breakfast co-presenter James Ashby later said that watching Scott endure substantial media and public scrutiny during the investigation without being able to help was the lowest point of his radio career.James Ashby talks to radioinfo about his day in court radioinfo, 21 November 2002 =Morning Announcer Dispute= Former WIN Television newsreader Bruce Diamond was employed by 4RO in 2004 to host a new 10am-midday program called CQ Today. 4RO decided to employ Diamond as he was a well-known media identity in Central Queensland having read the local news from Rockhampton's RTQ studio for more than twenty years before finishing in late 2002. In August 2005, Diamond received a letter from 4RO management requesting him to stop talking about certain things on air. Diamond was instructed to stop talking about the local state member of parliament, Member for Rockhampton Robert Schwarten; Diamond's campaign calling for Rockhampton to receive an oncology unit at Rockhampton Hospital to limit long-distance travel for cancer patients; and 4RO's breakfast announcer Jeffrey Goodwin who Diamond claimed accepted a gift from Robert Schwarten (a cap) which Diamond described as unethical. Diamond said he refused to be \\"gagged\\" and continued talking about the issues despite the request by management.Diamond flares hot at gag letter, Mikarla Thurecht, The Morning Bulletin, 9 August 2005 Schwarten said he had approached 4RO management for a \\"fair go\\" because Diamond had been criticising him on air for seven months, and claimed Diamond had gone too far when he involved Schwarten's wife and son. Diamond refuted the claim and invited Schwarten to submit any evidence to show how he had involved his family. In late January 2006, 4RO axed CQ Today and shortened the breakfast program by an hour when the station decided to take the nationally syndicated John Laws Morning Show from 2UE in Sydney between 9am and midday each day. Diamond said he had \\"heated discussions\\" with 4RO management when he was fired when he concluded what turned out to be his last program on 27 January 2006. Diamond also claimed he was considering legal action, claiming 4RO had told him that they wanted him to host a new afternoon drive program on 4RO. Diamond also said 4RO staff had threatened to call the police when he offered to drop by the radio station to pick up the mail that was addressed to him.Job lost, but mail sorted, The Morning Bulletin, 1 February 2006 Notable Past Announcers Since 4RO's inception in 1932, hundreds of announcers have worked at 4RO.

Population In 2004, there were about 921 (784 men and 137 women) inmates in the prison and divided amongst male and female inmates. With the 2010 population at 926, a new prison is being built in Ka Ho as the current facility can only hold 1500. The new prison was scheduled to open in 2014. However, this has since been delayed. Circa 2014 there were 959 prisoners, including 195 women. The total occupancy rate was 84%, with the women's area having an occupancy rate of 83%.

The facility consists of a series or connected buildings surrounded by a white wall with barbed wire. Four watchtowers are found along the prison walls. There is also a juvenile detention facility in Macau, the Youth Correctional Institution (; ), also in Coloane, with sections for boys and girls. Due to Coloane Prison being at almost full capacity, a new facility is under construction in Ka Ho. Construction of this facility began in 2010 and was scheduled to open by 2014 but has since been delayed.

Biography Erik Tryggelin studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts (Konstakademien) in Stockholm. Then he studied in Paris for some time, during the period of October 1911 until January 1913. In Paris he lived a normal artists' life with his Swedish fellows, for instance David Wallin (1876–1957), Svante Kede (1877–1955), Otto Strandman (1871–1970), Fritz Lindström (1874–1962) and Svante Nilsson (1869–1942). In Paris he accompanied the art scene and he discovered modernism. In the springtime of 1912 he went to the gallery Bernheim- JeuneGalerie Bernheim-Jeune (French)Galerie Bernheim-Jeune (French) and saw the futurists. In 1906 Galerie Bernheim-Jeune was installed in 25, Boulevard de la Madeleine in Paris. Originally an art dealer in Brussels, Alexandre Bernheim moved to Paris in the late 1880s. He opened a gallery there, where his two sons, Joseph, known as Josse, and Gaston, soon came to work. Josse and Gaston Bernheim ran the Paris art firm Bernheim-Jeune, established by their father Alexandre Bernheim.Joseph Bernheim-Jeune and Gaston Bernheim de Villers Around 1900, the gallery specialised in Impressionist paintings and the works of later artists. Closely associated with the Nabi painters, in particular Pierre Bonnard and Félix Vallotton – who in fact married one of their sisters – the two brothers not only sold, but also bought and collected many Nabi works. Later, they commissioned several family portraits from them. Among others Josse and Gaston exhibited and moreover Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat, Kees van Dongen, Henri Matisse, Henri Rousseau (he was also known as Le Douanier, the customs officer), Raoul Dufy, Maurice de Vlaminck, Amedeo Modigliani and Maurice Utrillo exhibited. Galerie Bernheim-Jeune became the centre of the avant-garde of the 20th century. Erik Tryggelin also visited Gertrude Stein’s collection with works by Picasso and Matisse. In Paris Erik Tryggelin also met Karl Isakson and John Sten, and he was surprised by their positive attitude. With the breakthrough of modernism he and his conservative fellows felt that their art was a thing of the past. The first world war vanished the Stockholm that he had portrayed with tender love. After the World War I he disappeared into anonymity, he lived as a bachelor, he was 84 years old. Tryggelin mainly performed figurative compositions and cityscapes, often with fine evening mood, and with motifs often from Stockholm, Visby and Vadstena. He is a reporter and stroller and in his art you see the people first, and then you think of the environment.

Khalifé was awarded first place on piano and a degree in music theory. In 2000, Khalifé moved to New York City to study piano with Hungarian pianist Gyorgy Sandor at the Juilliard School of Music. He graduated in 2003. Career In Paris before college, Khalifé won piano competitions at Radio France, at the UFAM Competition, and at the Claude Kahn International Piano Competition. In 1994, he performed at the Gaveau Music Hall. He toured the Middle East with the Boulogne-Billancourt Orchestra, where he performed the Rachmaninov piano concerto No. 4 and Ravel's piano concerto in G. Khalifé has performed in the Middle East and the United States as a solo artist as well as with clarinetist Kinan Azmeh, often playing classical works as well as improvised compositions. Khalifé performed in Brazil with Brazilian cellist Fabio Presgrave. While at Juilliard, Khalifé met pianist Francesco Tristano. They performed several improvised concerts for piano-duo and began what would be a long-term creative collaboration. Khalifé also performed improvised concerts for two pianos at Juilliard with pianist Francesco Schlimé. Khalifé has released multiple live and studio records as a solo artist. In 2002, Khalifé released his first record, a double record called Live in Beirut, which was reinterpretations of traditional classical music pieces. In 2005, he released his second record, Scene from Hellek, which consisted of original compositions. In 2006, Khalifé performed at the University of Michigan's Hill Auditorium as part of the Arab World Music Summit. In 2007, Khalifé released a record called Piano Concertos which was Piano Concerto No. 5 by Sergei Prokofiev and Piano Concerto No. 1 by Lebanese- Russian composer Abdalla El-Masri. In 2013, Khalifé performed original music inspired by the Arab Spring called Requiem for Beirut at the Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra and the MDR Leipzig Radio Choir. In 2015, he performed the work at an outdoor concert at Martyrs' Square in Beirut. In 2016, Khalifé performed his composition Stories for piano and orchestra with the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia. In May 2017, he performed his work, Voyage with Marcel Khalifé at the Philharmonie de Paris with his father and at the Orchestre national d'Île-de-France, conducted by Julien Leroy. In 2018, Khalifé released his fifth solo record, an almost completely instrumental work called Lost. =Aufgang= In 2005, Khalifé founded the classic electronic group Aufgang, initially as a modern experimental music piano duo with Francesco Schlimé aided by digitized music. Aufgang then became a three person project with Khalifé, Francesco Tristano, and Aymeric Westrich, with a record deal with the French label InFiné. They broke out at the 2005 Sonar Festival in Barcelona. =Marcel, Rami and Bachar Khalifé= In 2011, Khalifé began a new project with his father and brother called \\"Marcel, Rami & Bachar Khalifé\\". They debuted at the Beirut Music & Art Festival and was broadcast on MTV. The group was made up of Marcel Khalifé on oud with son Rami Khalifé on piano and son Bachar Khalifé on percussion – with Gilbert Yammine on qanun. In 2016, the group released a collaborative record called Andalusia of Love, a mixture of traditional music inspired by the Palestinian writer Mahmoud Darwish and improvised compositions from Rami and Bachar. They toured the United States under the sponsorship of American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, making their United States debut at Town Hall in New York City. Personal life Khalifé lives in Paris with his wife, ABC Broadcast Journalist Mariam Saab and their two children.

Founded in 1887, it now has 325 combined locations, including 190 bank branches and three loan production offices in 12 states primarily throughout the South. The company has 16 wealth management locations in five states, and one Iberia Capital Partners office in New Orleans. IberiaBank is an FDIC-insured institution regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. On March 31, 2009, as the financial crisis came to an end, IberiaBank became the first financial institution in the country to repay its TARP funds to the Treasury. History =Foundations= The bank opened its doors on March 12, 1887 as a savings and loan association under the name Iberia Building Association. The name originates from New Iberia, Louisiana, which dates back to 1779 when Spanish conquerors named their newly settled \\"Nueva Iberia\\" after the Iberian Peninsula. At the time the bank was founded, New Iberia was a farming community of about 3,000 people. Its principal industry was sugarcane farming, as the area's oil reserves, which would later spur population and economic growth, had yet to be discovered. For its first 100 years, the bank's main functions were taking deposits and making home mortgage loans in the New Iberia community. In 1956, Iberia Building Association changed its name to Iberia Savings & Loan (ISLA). Since savings and loan associations, or \\"thrifts,\\" could not lend to businesses, ISLA was not affected by the oil crisis in the early 1980s like many Louisiana commercial banks were. After regulations preventing thrifts from expanding eased in 1985, the bank absorbed several struggling thrifts during the 1980s oil glut. Branches opened in Morgan City and Franklin, Louisiana, moving the thrift beyond Iberia Parish for the first time. ISLA became Iberia Savings Bank (ISB) in 1988, and expansion continued the following year into Lafayette, Louisiana with the acquisition of Acadia Savings & Loan. Additional regulatory changes in the early 1990s permitted Louisiana savings and loan associations to become state-chartered commercial banks. Bank President Larrey Mouton prepared the company for this transition by forming the holding company ISB Financial Corporation and releasing an IPO on April 13, 1995. Former IBERIABANK logo, used officially until 2007 In 1999, former Bank One executive Daryl Byrd took over as CEO, ushering in a period of rapid growth for the bank. With its new name IBERIABANK Corporation, the company would grow to acquire 24 banks since 2001. When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in 2005, IberiaBank incurred hurricane-related expenses including loan losses associated with the storm, facility repairs and insurance deductible payments. Being a bank solely based in Louisiana, the organization decided to diversify its geographic footprint in the years following the storm to minimize risk. The bank expanded beyond Louisiana for the first time in 2007 with the purchase of Arkansas –based Pulaski Bank and Trust. Spring of 2008 began a period of rapid growth fueled by accumulating the assets of failed banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It began with the assumption of insured deposits from Arkansas-based ANB Financial, the third FDIC-insured bank to fail in 2008. The following year, IberiaBank assumed the assets and branches of Birmingham-based CapitalSouth, Orion Bank of Florida, and Century Bank of Florida. Its fifth and final FDIC-assisted transaction occurred late 2009 with the purchase of East Florida's Sterling Bank. =2000-2017: Mergers and acquisitions= IBERIABANK footprint The company has grown to acquire 24 other banks since 2001. 2003 - LBA Savings Bank (Lafayette, Louisiana) 2004 - Alliance Bank (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) 2005 - American Horizons Bank (Monroe, Louisiana) 2007 - Pulaski Bank and Trust Company (Little Rock, Arkansas); First Community Bank (Jonesboro, Arkansas) 2008 - ANB Financial (Bentonville, Arkansas) 2009 - CapitalSouth (Birmingham, Alabama); Orion Bank (Naples, Florida); Century Bank (Sarasota, Florida); Sterling Bank (Lantana, Florida) 2011 - Omni Bank (Metairie, Louisiana); Cameron State Bank (Lake Charles, Louisiana) 2012 - Florida Gulf Bank (Ft.

Founded in 2009, the company develops vehicles, products and services related to sustainable transportation. The company has facilities in Plymouth, Michigan; Normal, Illinois; San Jose, Irvine, and Carson, California; Vancouver, Canada; and the United Kingdom. In 2017, Rivian announced it was building an electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) and pickup truck on a platform that executives claim can be modified for future vehicles or adapted by other companies. Both vehicles will be semi-autonomous and are designed for both on-road and off- road driving. History The company was founded in 2009 by CEO Robert \\"RJ\\" Scaringe, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a doctorate in mechanical engineering. After being renamed Avera Automotive and then Rivian Automotive, the company began focusing on autonomous electric vehicles in 2011. Rivian received a large investment and grew significantly in 2015, opening research facilities in Michigan and the Bay Area. Relocating headquarters to Livonia, Michigan to be closer to key suppliers, Rivian began working exclusively on electric autonomous vehicles, specifically building an \\"entire ecosystem\\" of related products. It also began gearing its prototypes towards the \\"ride-sharing and driverless car markets.\\" A 2011 prototype from Rivian, introduced by Scaringe It was reported in September 2016 that Rivian was negotiating to buy a manufacturing plant formerly owned by Mitsubishi Motors in Normal, Illinois. In January 2017, Rivian acquired the plant and its manufacturing contents for $16 million, with the plant to become Rivian's primary North American manufacturing facility. Rivian's acquisition of a near production-ready facility instead of building a new factory has been likened to Tesla's acquisition of the NUMMI plant in California. The company received a $1 million grant and a five-year tax abatement from Normal contingent on meeting employment targets and investing $40.5 million over five years. Rivian also received $49.5 million in tax credits from the state government; these credits are also contingent upon meeting employment targets and investing at least $175 million into the site by 2024. Rivian employed around 100 people at the end of 2016, and that number grew to 160 by August 2017. Sumitomo Corporation made a \\"strategic investment\\" in Rivian in December 2017, and Rivian reported that its alpha prototypes were complete and undergoing testing. Also that month, Rivian revealed its first two products: an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV, provisionally named the A1T and A1C respectively. With both vehicles unveiled at the LA Auto Show in November 2018, production is scheduled to begin in 2020 with the truck to launch first. Both vehicles were described as ready for rough terrain and semi-autonomous, and the company outlined a plan for its next generation of models to be fully autonomous. Rivian had 250 employees at the start of 2018. In May 2018, Rivian received $200 million in debt financing from Standard Chartered Bank, bringing total raised funds to upwards of $450 million. Other investors at the time included Abdul Latif Jameel. As of February 2019, Rivian employs 750 people across facilities in Michigan, Illinois, California, and the United Kingdom. Around 50 of those employees were in Normal, putting Rivian ahead of its local job-creation targets. In February 2019, Amazon announced it would be leading an investment round of $700 million into Rivian. The round included participation from existing shareholders as well. In April 2019, Ford Motor Company invested $500 million. As of June 2019 the company employed over 1,000 people. As a result of the fallout surrounding the 2020 Covid-19 heath crisis, Ford has terminated the Rivian contract. While the manufacturer will be shifting production to their Lincoln Motors team, they are also maintaining the relationship with Rivian. In September 2019, Cox Automotive invested $350 million into Rivian, bringing the total raised in 2019 to $1.5 billion. Rivian remains independent, but Cox Automotive plans to add a representative to Rivian's board as part of the investment. Later that month, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian, as part of its plan to convert its delivery fleet to 100% renewable energy by 2030.Amazon is purchasing 100,000 Rivian Electric Vans CNBC.com. Retrieved September 20, 2019. Delivery of the vehicles will begin in 2021. Amazon expects to have 10,000 electric vans in operation by 2022, but is not slated to take delivery of the entire 100,000 Rivian vans the contract calls for until 2030.https://www.motortrend.com/news/rivian-electric-delivery-van-amazon- photos-specs/ In April 2020, Rivian reached 2000+ employees. Rivian raised capital of during 2019, through four major investments, including a investment by Ford in April, which \\"plans to use the Rivian Skateboard for a new battery electric vehicle,\\" and investment round led by T Rowe Price announced in December to get the R1T truck and R1S SUV into production by late 2020.  Products  =Electric vehicles= R1T pickup at the 2018 LA Auto Show R1S SUV at the 2018 LA Auto Show In May 2018, Rivian stated that they had dubbed their upcoming truck with the working name A1T and their SUV with the working name A1C. In November 2018, the truck and SUV were renamed the R1T and R1S, respectively. Designed to be capable off-road, both models have 14 inches of ground clearance. The truck was claimed in early testing to be able to sprint from 0 to 97 km/h (60 miles per hour) in under 3 seconds, wade through 1.1 m (3.6 feet) of water and climb a 45 degree incline. The vehicles are Level 3 autonomous, and have extra features such as automated trailer backup. According to Engadget, “the most expensive models will reach around 450 miles on a charge and feature the 800HP electric motor Scaringe said would beat Italian supercars.” Rivian has said it is designing the vehicles to facilitate “car-sharing” with their autonomous features. =Chassis and batteries= Because of a shared electric chassis, the R1T and R1S designs were aiming to have 91% shared components . The chassis includes braking, suspension, and cooling systems with a battery in the center. Rivian refers to the relatively- flat, low-center-of-gravity base chassis as \\"Skateboard,\\" which makes for a chassis that is more straightforward to customize for various body types that might be placed above it. Rivian intends to license the electric chassis to other manufacturers as a design base for machinery such as cars and other components. Facilities As of 2019, the company had four primary locations. Its headquarters in Plymouth, Michigan are dedicated to finances, engineering, and design. A facility in Irvine, California focuses on batteries, electrical hardware, and vehicle control software, while a facility in San Jose, California develops self-driving technology and data. The 2.6-million-square- foot factory in Normal, Illinois manufactures vehicle components such as battery packs. The Normal plant has a paint shop, robotics, stamping machines, and other production equipment, such as injection molding. The company has additional office locations in Carson, California and the United Kingdom designated for electric power conversion and advanced engineering, respectively. Collaborations On 20 December 2018, professional rock climber Alex Honnold announced his partnership with Rivian as a brand partner and collaborator. During a live stream on 15 June 2019, Rivian announced plans to collaborate with the Honnold Foundation and nonprofit Casa Pueblo on a solar project aiming to establish a microgrid in Adjuntas, Puerto Rico, a city that was severely affected by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Rivian plans to repurpose used battery packs from its development vehicles into stationary energy storage units. The microgrid is intended to grant residents access to electricity for core business and will be used daily to mitigate the high cost of energy in Puerto Rico, which is twice the U.S. national average. The project is expected to launch in 2020. In 2019, Rivian partnered with Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman to provide the first ever production pickups (VIN 000001 and 000002) for use as logistics vehicles and camera cars for Long Way Up. They also set up 240 level 2 and 3 charging stations, at 140 locations, along the route from Tierra del Fuego to Los Angeles.

On the first day, the Parliamentarians took the lower town. The Royalist defenders retreated into the stronger fortifications of the upper town, which encompassed and incorporated Lincoln Castle and Lincoln Cathedral. The siege ended four days later when the Parliamentarian soldiers stormed the castle, taking prisoner the Royalist governor, Sir Francis Fane, and what remained of his garrison. Prelude Early in 1644, Parliamentarian forces besieged the Royalist stronghold of Newark-on-Trent. The commander of the besiegers, Lord Willoughby, also had command of the Parliamentarian forces in Lincolnshire and had ordered the all of the garrison of Lincoln to come to his aid. King Charles dispatched his nephew Prince Rupert to relieve Newark, ordering him to collect all the troops he could in Shropshire, Cheshire, and Wales, march into Lancashire, reinforce his troops from the Earl of Derby's Royalist tenantry, and then march into Yorkshire. The command of the Parliamentarian forces investing Newark had passed to veteran Scottish soldier Sir John Meldrum, who chose to oppose Rupert rather than retreat. Rupert defeated him on the banks of the Trent on 22 March 1644 and relieved Newark. With the defeat of the Parliamentarians' Lincolnshire forces at Newark, the county lay open to Royalist occupation. Lincoln was occupied on 23 March, where the Royliasts found and requisitioned 2,000 muskets. The Parliamentarians abandoned Sleaford and on orders from Meldrum, Gainsborough was slighted so that it could not be garrisoned by the Royalists. However, Rupert decided that he could not consolidate the gains he had made, and after garrisoning Lincoln and placing it under the command of Sir Francis Fane, he retreated into the west Midlands. By 23 March, he was back in Oxford to report to the king. A month earlier however, Parliamentarians under Lord Fairfax and Scottish Covenanters under the Earl of Leven had laid siege to York, which was defended by the Marquess of Newcastle. Early in the siege, Newcastle decided that his cavalry would be of little use within the besieged city. Commanded by Newcastle's lieutenant general of horse, George, Lord Goring, they broke out of the city, and escaped pursuit. They made their way to Newark, plundering as they marched. The Parliamentarian army of the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester counterattacked. In the last week of April, Manchester was at Stamford. He ordered his cavalry under the command of Oliver Cromwell to advance. They cleared Lincolnshire of marauding parties of Cavaliers from Newark and drove them across the Trent, where they joined Goring at Mansfield. Manchester then marched to Lincoln, arriving on 3 May 1644. Siege Partial view of the eastern gate (to the right; the observatory tower is to the left) View from the tower of Lincoln Cathedral towards Lincoln Castle View from Lincoln Castle Manchester's army consisted of about 6,000 infantry and cavalry. The garrison of the town was about 2,000 strong. On 3 May the Parliamentarians managed to capture parts of the lower town and the Royalists retreated in their upper works which surrounded Lincoln Castle and Lincoln Cathedral. On 4 May the Roundheads were unable to press their attack because it rained heavily making the mound under the castle very slippery. Cromwell posted his horse so as to cover the siege from any interruption from Goring. He made his dispositions so well that, hearing on 5 May that Goring had crossed the Trent, Cromwell's troopers were assembled and drawn up in little over an hour from the news being received. Goring, finding the outposts on the alert, fell back again. A contemporary Royalist report states that that night the Parliamentarians attempted to storm Lincoln Close but were repulsed with about 60 killed. Storming of the castle and the end of the siege The next night (6 May) the castle was stormed with the aid of scaling ladders. The Roundheads took about a quarter of an hour to reach the walls of the castle. The scaling ladders proved to be too short, but despite the defenders throwing boulders down upon the attackers (doing more injury than their gunfire had caused) the Parliamentarians managed to scale the walls and enter the castle. The Royalists fled from the parapets, begging for quarter, which was granted. Parliamentarian casualties were eight killed and about 40 wounded. The Royalists suffered about 50 killed with 100 officers and between 650 and 800 soldiers taken prisoner. Among the officers captured were Sir Charles Dallison, the former Recorder of Lincoln, and Sir Francis Fane. The Parliamentarians also captured eight cannons, and much other useful materiel. Aftermath The victorious Parliamentarian troops pillaged the upper town. On receipt of Manchester's report the Committee of Both Kingdoms in London sent him their congratulations. Shortly after the capture of Lincoln, Manchester ordered a bridge of boats to be built over the Trent at Gainsborough, and Cromwell crossed with 3,000 horse, while two regiments of foot (infantry) held the bridge. Goring appears to have had at least as many troopers as Cromwell, but the latter drove him up the Trent towards Newark, and headed him off at Mascomb Bridge, forcing him to swim the river in order to escape. Cromwell then returned to Bawtry and Tuxford (both on the Great North Road), where David Leslie joined him with a strong party of Scottish horse and placed himself under his command. Goring crossed from Newark into Leicestershire, where he commenced plundering the country up and down. The allied generals, however, refused to allow their horse to follow him, being convinced by this time that Rupert intended to relieve York. They therefore kept their horse in hand in south Yorkshire and waited for Manchester to advance with his foot. Goring subsequently moved via Derbyshire to Bury in Lancashire, where he joined Rupert. Manchester himself remained in Lincoln until around 22 May when he sent a report on his preparations for his advance to link up with the besiegers of York. He joined them on 3 June. Manchester, Fairfax and the Scots ultimately won a major victory over Rupert at the Battle of Marston Moor on 2 July.

Exhaled breath is naturally produced by the human body through expiration and therefore can be collected in non-invasively and in an unlimited way. VOCs in exhaled breath can represent biomarkers for certain pathologies (lung cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and others). Breath gas concentration can then be related to blood concentrations via mathematical modeling as for example in blood alcohol testing. There are various techniques that can be employed to collect and analyze exhaled breath. Research on exhaled breath started many years ago, there is currently limited clinical application of it for disease diagnosis. However, this might change in the near future as currently large implementation studies are starting globally. involving an online e-nose solution: BreathBase. History Lavoiser in his laboratory studying human respiration. It is known that since the times of Hyppocrates, exhaled breath analysis was performed with the aim of disease diagnosis. For example, it was believed that the exhaled breath of a diabetes person presented a sweet odor, while for people affected by kidney failure it showed a fish-like smell. Only with Lavoisier, the pure smelling of human exhaled breath was substituted by a systematic analysis of the chemical contents. The area of modern breath testing started in 1971, when Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling demonstrated that human breath is a complex gas, containing more than 200 different VOCs. Later, Phillips identified more than 3000 VOCs in exhaled breath. In recent years, many scientists focused on the analysis of exhaled breath with the aim of identifying disease specific biomarkers at early stages. Lung cancer, COPD, head and neck cancer are among the diseases that were considered for biomarker detection. Even if exhaled breath analysis started many years ago, there is still no clinical application of it for disease diagnosis. This is mainly due to a lack of standardization of the clinical tests, both for breath collection procedures and their analysis. Though the use of so-called breath prints determined by these e-noses, are promising and seem to be able to distinguish between lung cancer, COPD, and asthma,. They also seem capable of detecting the various phenotypes of asthma and COPD. and other diseaseshttps://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/easl_posters_rs_0.pdf Overview Endogenous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released within the human organism as a result of normal metabolic activity or due to pathological disorders. They enter the blood stream and are eventually metabolized or excreted via exhalation, skin emission, urine, etc. Breath sampling is non-invasive and breath samples can be extracted as often as desired.H. Koc, K. Unterkofler, S. Teschl, and J. King: \\"Mathematical modeling for breath gas analysis,\\" 3. Forschungsforum der Österreichischen Fachhochschulen, Wien 2011. Identification and quantification of potential disease biomarkers can be seen as the driving force for the analysis of exhaled breath. Moreover, future applications for medical diagnosis and therapy control with dynamic assessments of normal physiological function or pharmacodynamics are intended. Exogenous VOCs penetrating the body as a result of environmental exposure can be used to quantify body burden. Also breath tests are often based on the ingestion of isotopically labeled precursors, producing isotopically labeled carbon dioxide and potentially many other metabolites. However, breath sampling is far from being a standardized procedure due to the numerous confounding factors biasing the concentrations of volatiles in breath. These factors are related to both the breath sampling protocols as well as the complex physiological mechanisms underlying pulmonary gas exchange. Even under resting conditions exhaled breath concentrations of VOCs can strongly be influenced by specific physiological parameters such as cardiac output and breathing patterns, depending on the physico-chemical properties of the compound under study. Understanding the influence of all this factors and their control is necessary for achieving an accurate standardization of breath sample collection and for the correct deduction of the corresponding blood concentration levels. The simplest model relating breath gas concentration to blood concentrations was developed by FarhiLeon E. Farhi: Elimination of inert gas by the lung, Respiration Physiology 3 (1967) 1–11 : C_A = frac{C_{bar v}}{lambda_text{b:air} + dot V_A/dot Q_c}, where C_A denotes the alveolar concentration which is assumed to be equal to the measured concentration. It expresses the fact that the concentration of an inert gas in the alveolar air depends on the mixed venous concentration C_{bar v} , the substance-specific blood:air partition coefficient lambda_text{b:air} , and the ventilation-perfusion ratio dot V_A/dot Q_c . But this model fails when two prototypical substances like acetone (partition coefficient lambda_text{b:air} = 340 ) or isoprene (partition coefficient lambda_text{b:air} = 0.75 ) are measured.Julian King, Alexander Kupferthaler, Karl Unterkofler, Helin Koc, Susanne Teschl, Gerald Teschl, Wolfram Miekisch, Jochen Schubert, Hartmann Hinterhuber, and Anton Amann: Isoprene and acetone concentration profiles during exercise at an ergometer, J. Breath Research 3, (2009) 027006 (16 pp) E.g., multiplying the proposed population mean of approximately 1 mu g/l acetone in end-tidal breath by the partition coefficient lambda_text{b:air} = 340 at body temperature grossly underestimates observed (arterial) blood levels spreading around 1 mg/l . Furthermore, breath profiles of acetone (and other highly soluble volatile compounds such as 2-pentanone or methyl acetate) associated with moderate workload ergometer challenges of normal healthy volunteers drastically depart from the trend suggested by the equation above. Hence some more refined models are necessary. Such models have been developed recently.Julian King, Helin Koc, Karl Unterkofler, Pawel Mochalski, Alexander Kupferthaler, Gerald Teschl, Susanne Teschl, Hartmann Hinterhuber, and Anton Amann: Physiological modeling of isoprene dynamics in exhaled breath, J.

Some examples of breath collection tools used across the research industry for VOC analysis are: * Coated stainless steel canister * End tidal air collector * Tedlar bag * ReCIVA® Breath Sampler The first three devices can be used as a vehicle for direct introduction of a gas sample into an appropriate analytical instrument, or serve as a reservoir of breath gas into which an absorption device such as an SPME fiber is placed to collect specific compounds. The ReCIVA Breath Sampler is one of the latest advancements in the field of breath analysis, it is currently being used in the largest breath based lung cancer trial in the world.  Online analysis  Breath can also be analyzed on-line, which allows for insight into a person's metabolism without the need for sample preparation or sample collection. Technologies that enable real time analysis of breath include: * Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectromerty (PTR-MS) *Secondary Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SESI-MS) *Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) Breath analysis is very vulnerable to confounding factors. Analyzing breath in real-time has the advantage that potential confounding factors associated with sample handling and manipulation are eliminated. Recent efforts have focused on standardizing on-line breath analysis procedures based on SESI-MS, and to systematically study and reduce other confounding sources of variability. The state of the art in the fields of breathomics and breath analysis is the all-in-one solution BreathBase®. It allows easy classification, phenotyping, and therapy response prediction with high accuracy. Instead of quantifying each VOC, the measurement is based on cross-reactive nonspecific sensor arrays purposely not identifying individual VOCs. The VOCs competitively interact with the sensors allowing multiple VOCs to bind to the same sensor based on their affinity for both the sensor and its substrate. Likewise, multiple sensors interact with the same volatile. Notably, this is comparable to the powerful mammalian olfactory system and results in a pattern of firing sensors that is driven by the complete mixture of VOCs. Analytical instruments Breath analysis can be done with various forms of mass spectrometry, but there are also simpler methods for specific purposes, such as the Halimeter and the breathalyzer. * Gas chromatography- mass spectrometry GC-MS * Gas chromatography-UV spectrometry GC-UV * Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry PTR-MS and PTR-TOF * Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry SIFT-MS * Ion mobility spectrometry IMS * Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR * Laser spectrometry Spectroscopy * Chemical sensors resp.

She lives and works in Berlin and Seoul. Yang often uses standard household objects in her works, and tries to liberate them from their functional context, and apply other connotations and meaning to them.Podeschwa, Isabel 2002, \\"Manifesta4\\" “Linguistic and didactic processes” are central features of her work. Much of Yang’s artworks attempt to provide sensory experiences through abstract narratives. Biography Yang was born in South Korea in 1971. Her father, Hansoo Yang, is a journalist and her mother, Misoon Kim, is a writer.Yang, Haegue 2002 \\"Manifesta4\\" Yang received her Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree (B.F.A.) in 1994 from the Seoul National University in Korea. In 1999, she received her Master's (Meisterschüler) in Städelschule Frankfurt am Main in Germany. Yang is based in Berlin and Seoul, so she often travels between the two cities. Her main studio is located in Kreuzberg, Germany. Career After receiving her B.F.A., Yang moved to Berlin and began her artistic career in the late nineties. She is known for her creative use of the Venetian blinds in her works. She uses mundane objects and materials to create “complex and nuanced installations that are informed by poetry, politics, and human emotions”.Walker Art Center 2008 Among her numerous art pieces, she has worked with laundry racks, decorative lights, infrared heaters, scent emitters, and industrial fans. Yang is a contemporary artist exhibiting in various countries including the United States, France, Italy, England, Spain, China, and Japan. She dedicates most of her time creating new art pieces and working on exhibitions. She has also written and collaborated on many published works that correspond with the exhibitions she displayed. In 2013, Yang had seven solo shows on three different continents, three publications, and other group exhibitions in that year as well.Schlaegel, Andreas, \\"Ten Questions: Haegue Yang\\", 2013 Yang has participated in the 2006 São Paulo Art Biennial, the 55th Carnegie International in Pittsburgh, the 2008 Turin Triennale, represented South Korea in the 53rd Venice Biennale in 2009, and participated in dOCUMENTA (13) in Kassel, Germany in 2012. Yang’s first exhibition in the United States, titled \\"Brave New Worlds\\", was at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2007. In 2015, Haegue Yang participated in the Biennale de Lyon, the Sharjah Biennial and the 8th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art. The artist also had institutional exhibitions in Asia, at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, and the Leuum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul.  Exhibitions  =Arrivals (2011)= For this solo exhibition, Yang occupied three floors of the gallery in Kunsthaus Bregenz. On the first floor, she exhibited past works including Fishing (1995), a small lacquer painting, a video trilogy: Unfolding Places (2004), Restrained Courage (2004), and Squandering Negative Spaces (2006), Gymnastics of the Foldables (2006), and Three Kinds in Transition (2008).Chateigné, Yann, “Haegue Yang – Kunsthaus Bregenz” Frieze, Issue 139, 2011, p. 126. On the second floor, her Venetian blind installation, Cittadella (2011), occupied the entire space. On the third floor, Yang set up an exhibit titled Warrior Believer Lover (2011) which consisted of thirty-three light sculptures built on wheeled stands.Chong, Doryun, “Movement Studies” Parkett, Issue 89, 2011, pp. 66-73. =Approaching: Choreography Engineered in Never-Past Tense (2012)= This exhibition was part of the dOCUMENTA (13) in Kassel, Germany. Documenta is an art exhibition held every five years in Kassel that displays modern and contemporary art. Yang’s exhibition revealed electrically-controlled Venetian blinds that were carefully choreographed to move in distinct patterns, and the mechanism looped after the sequence was finished. Works =Accommodating the Epic Dispersion – On Non-cathartic Volume of Dispersion (2012)= This art piece was displayed in the Haus der Kunst as part of Der Öffentlichkeit – von den Freunden Haus der Kunst exhibit. Yang used colorful Venetian blinds that hung from the ceiling in various angles. Depending on where the visitor stood, the blinds appeared opaque, semi-opaque, or transparent.Studio Yang 2012, http://heikejung.de/AccomodatingEpicDispersion_Exhibition.html The title of the artwork was chosen to represent the narratives of people of diaspora. For example, Yang read the biographies of figures such as the Korean-Japanese essayist, Kyungsik Suh, and Italian-Jewish chemist and author, Primo Levi, and was inspired to create the title of her work. =Sonic Figures (2013)= For this series of works, Yang was influenced by Oskar Schlemmer’s Triadic Ballet from 1922.Studio Yang 2013, http://heikejung.de/Bergen.html The Sonic Figures are intricate sculptures made by using brass-plated bells on steel stands. These works were part of an exhibition called Journal of Echomimetic Motions displayed in Bergen Kunsthall, Norway. These sculptures embody ideas of mobility and Yang “negates the static furnishings of the exhibition space with its fixed installations and carefully placed objects” by introducing mobile performative sculptures. = The Malady of Death (ongoing series) = Beginning in 2010 during her residency at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in the United States, Haegue Yang has staged a series of areadings of the French writer Marguerite Duras' 1982 novella The Malady of Death. Each reading has been in different languages - often local languages, with a different performer and with various visual outcomes. Yang's staging of The Malady of Death is characterised by an inconclusive uncertainty and the unknown, much like Duras' original text. The performative outcome of The Malady of Death is autonomous from the aesthetic of Yang's other work. In December 2015, as part of Mobile M+: Live Art, Yang presented The Malady of Death: Écrire et Lire, which consisted of a staging of The Malady of Death at Hong Kong's Sunbeam Theatre and the publication of the first Chinese translation. Held over two nights, the opening performance saw Hong Kong writer, Hon Lai-chu recite Duras' text, dressed in a long white dress upon an all but black stage. The staging included a burning mosquito coil, moving lights and intermittent bold background projections of the image of French actress Jeanne Balibar. To date, The Malady of Death has been performed at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (2010); Namsan Arts Center, Seoul (2010); and dOCUMENTA (13), Kassel, (2013); and most recently at Mobile M+: Live Art, Hong Kong (2015).

It was shot at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith with sets designed by the art director Alex Vetchinsky. Plot When the castle of the earls of Chaunduyt (pronounced \\"Condit\\") is damaged by German bombing during the Second World War, an ancient ghost is awakened. He is sighted by the butler Alfred Bucket and another servant when they come to inspect the damage, and he becomes front page news. Lawyer Peter Hayward joins a tour of the somewhat decrepit castle (conducted by the poverty-stricken, but unconcerned Lord Chaunduyt), and admires portraits of a young woman, who turns out to be Lady Mary, the present lord's daughter. When Peter comes to look at manuscripts that were also uncovered by the bombing, he is pleasantly surprised to find that his lordship has forgotten the appointment, but Lady Mary has returned home and can be persuaded to assist him. (She has socialist tendencies and is engaged to commoner George Bucket, much to her snobbish aunt's displeasure.) They spend much time together; after a week, Peter asks Mary if she was only trying to help sell the manuscripts. She admits it is important to her father, then tells him she has to go away the next day when he makes it clear he is attracted to her. When Peter asks when she found out, she tells him it was half a minute ago. In the local pub, the ghost tries to engage a somewhat inebriated Peter to take on a case after Pike ploughs up a cricket pitch; over 400 years, his conscience has grown to bother him that he fenced in land that did not belong to him. When Mary returns, she finds Peter still there. She then tells him that her fiance, whom she has seen only once briefly since they were children, is coming home from the war. Discouraged, Peter decides to leave. At the train station, he learns that Pike has confiscated the land Harry used to operate a brickyard, probably out of spite for losing the case over the cricket grounds, and now people are saying that he is responsible. At a party, Mary inadvertently learns that George is engaged to someone else, which makes her distraught. However, she pulls herself together when Peter appears; she continues to discourage his romantic interest in her. Meanwhile, Peter concocts a plan. He has some of the local residents move sheep onto the confiscated land. When Pike takes the matter to court, presided over by Lord Chaunduyt, Peter pleads not guilty for himself and all of the other defendants. Pike is represented by Sir Henry Wade and Patterson. Peter proceeds to contend that the recently discovered manuscripts prove the Lord Chaunduyt who enclosed the land originally was not in fact Lord Chaunduyt at all. Peter calls Dr. Rose of the British Museum as his first witness. He confirms the authenticity of the manuscripts and reads a paragraph which contains a deathbed confession that a man switched his child with the infant Lord Chaunduyt. Peter then asserts that the rightful earl is poacher Harry Bucket! Sir Henry demands that Peter produce a witness to the signature. The ghost unexpectedly appears, takes the witness stand and confirms that the signature is that of his father. The case is dismissed. Harry is made Lord Chaunduyt by act of Parliament. Peter confesses to Mary that his aged father is a baronet and overcomes her outrage with a kiss. Meanwhile, the former earl enjoys himself by poaching.

For details of currently operating schools in the area, please see: List of schools in Dudley. The Blue Coat School Cradley High School Dudley Boys Grammar School Dudley Boys Grammar School (image) was a selective higher education school for boys aged from 11 to 18 years. Founded in 1562, it was located in Dudley, Worcestershire, and opened in July 1898 on its final site in St James's Road. 12 years later Dudley Girls High School opened in nearby buildings in Priory Road. The pupils of the two single-sex schools regularly held drama productions together, and a number of teachers taught at both establishments and the pupils of the two schools mixed on occasions for sixth form Physics lessons. In 1966, plans were unveiled for the grammar and high schools to merge and form a mixed comprehensive school, but these took almost a decade to become reality. In September 1972, the age range had changed from 11-18 to 12-18 as part of a re- organisation by Dudley council which saw the entry age for secondary school increased in the towns of Dudley, Sedgley, Coseley and Brierley Hill. Dudley Grammar School closed in July 1975 after 413 years, when it merged with the Girls High School to form The Dudley School with effect from September 1975. The merger also included the smaller Park Secondary School, which was located near the town's Grange Park, the buildings of which were briefly used as an annex to the new school until 1977. After more than a century the buildings of Dudley Grammar School are still in existence; they now house Castle High School, which was formed in September 1989 on the merger of The Dudley School and The Blue Coat School. The grammar school buildings were expanded between 1990 and 1995 as the old High School building was gradually emptied and eventually demolished at the start of 1996. However, the grammar school swimming pool was closed and demolished in 1990 to make way for part of the expansion. The pool had opened in 1951 as a memorial to the former grammar school pupils who had died in the First World War and Second World War. Former pupils of the school were known as Old Dudleians. Notable former pupils of Dudley Grammar School include Lionel Harry Butler (Principal Royal Holloway College 1973-81), Ian Serraillier (children's author who was an English teacher at the school 1939-1946), Martin Dunn (newspaper editor), Roger Cashmore, David Tristram and Hugh Walters. Dudley Girls High School The Dudley School The Dudley School was a mixed comprehensive school in Dudley, West Midlands, England. It was founded in 1975 on the merger on the town's two single-sex grammar schools, Dudley Grammar School and Dudley Girls High School, was located on the two sites near Dudley town centre. The formation of the school also involved a merger with Park Secondary Modern School, the buildings of which were annexed into the Dudley School for two years until the buildings were closed and demolished to make way for the new Jessons Middle School. The Dudley School catered for pupils aged from 12–18 years. In 1985, just ten years after the Dudley School's formation, Dudley council unveiled plans for it to merge with at least one smaller secondary school to create The Ednam School. One plan put forward at this time was for the Priory Road buildings (formerly the Girls High School) to be developed as a school for children aged up to 16 years, with the former Boys Grammar School buildings being converted into a sixth form college. By 1988, it had been decided that the Dudley School would merge with The Blue Coat School on Kates Hill with effect from September 1989. The school's pupils voted for the new school to be called Castle High, a name which was selected in the spring of 1989. The plan was for Castle High to exist solely at the Dudley School site, but for the first year it also incorporated the Blue Coat buildings for that school's oldest two year groups as sufficient space was not available at the Dudley School site until new buildings were completed and the sixth form was closed due to falling pupil numbers and a decision by the local authority to relocate most of the borough's sixth form facilities from schools to further education colleges. The last intake of sixth form students began their studies at the school in September 1988 and remained there until the sixth form closed in July 1990; there were no admissions to the sixth form at the new school in September 1989. The new school also took in some of the Sir Gilbert Claughton School pupils, with all but the oldest year group in that school being transferred to new schools before it closed completely in July 1990. The school's final head teacher was Mr Joseph Kenneth \\"Ken\\" West, who was head for the final four years until the merger following the retirement of Mr Alfred \\"Fred\\" Austin (born Fredi Stiller as a Jew in Czechoslovakia in 1928; and who became Fred Austin upon his adoption by a British family at the outbreak of World War II). Mr Austin had been head since the formation of the Dudley School in 1975 and Mr West was a teacher of Mathematics at the school. Ian Austin, who has served as Member of Parliament for Dudley North since May 2005, was a pupil at the school from 1977 until 1983. He is the adoptive son of the school's former head teacher. Flax Hall Primary School Flax Hall Primary School was a primary school located in Sedgley, West Midlands, England. It was built in the 1950s in Eve Lane - on the border with Dudley - to serve a newly completed council housing estate which was developed on adjoining farmland. Pupils attending were aged 5 to 11 years, but from September 1972 the school also provided education for 12-year-olds. Falling numbers on the school roll during the 1980s saw the local authority decide that it was no longer viable, and the school closed in July 1989, merging with Sycamore Green Primary School. However, the Flax Hall buildings were retained as an annexe to Sycamore Green until December 1991, when an extension to the main Sycamore Green site meant that all pupils were taught there and Flax Hall was converted into a community centre. Greenhill Middle School Greenhill Middle School was a 9-13 middle school situated in Halesowen, West Midlands (formerly Worcestershire), England. It opened in September 1972 within the buildings of the former Hill & Cakemore Secondary Modern boys and girls schools situated on Long Lane. Its opening coincided with the reorganisation of schools in Halesowen which saw 5-7 infant, 7-11 junior and 11-16/18 secondary schools replaced by 5-9 first, 9-13 middle and 13-18 secondary schools. The old Hill & Cakemore Secondary Modern School was relocated to a site in Kent Road which became known as Leasowes High School, serving pupils aged 13–18. However, three-tier education in Halesowen was a short lived experiment which lasted only 10 years. It was abolished in July 1982, although the buildings remained as an annexe of Leasowes High School, mostly for the teaching of pupils at the lower end of the new 11-16 age range. The Greenhill site remained in use until 1987, when extensions were completed at the main Leasowes site to accommodate the younger pupils. The Greenhill buildings fell into disuse and were demolished soon after. High Park School High Park School was a secondary school located in Stourbridge, West Midlands, England. It was built around 1960 as a secondary modern school to serve the Wollaston area of the town, adopting comprehensive status in September 1975. By the 1980s, pupil numbers at the school were falling and Dudley MBC decided to merge High Park with nearby Longlands School. The merger was completed in September 1990, when Ridgewood High School opened within the High Park buildings. The Longlands School buildings were taken over by Stourbridge College. At the time of Ridgewood's formation, new buildings were added to the High Park site to accommodate the pupils from the old Longlands School. Cradley Middle School Cradley Middle School was a 9-13 middle school situated in the Cradley area of Halesowen, West Midlands (formerly Worcestershire), England. It opened in September 1972 when Halesowen Urban District Council abolished the traditional 5-7 infant, 7-11 junior and 11-16/18 secondary schools in favour of 5-9 first, 9-13 middle and 13-16/18 secondary schools. It was situated within the buildings of Cradley Secondary Modern School, which had opened in 1939. In 1974, Halesowen and neighbouring Stourbridge (which had stuck with the traditional school age ranges) were merged into the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, which had adopted 5-8 first, 8-12 middle and 12-16/18 secondary schools in 1972. The first and middle schools in Halesowen were abolished in July 1982, with the traditional age ranges being reinstated with effect from the school year beginning September 1982. The reorganisation of schools in Halesowen saw Cradley Middle School close down and re-open as Cradley High School, which was based within its buildings. However, the buildings were unsuitable in the long term as a modern secondary school, and by 1990 they had all been demolished as the new Cradley High buildings were developed in pieces. Cradley High was a short-lived school, closing in July 2008 due to falling pupil numbers. The school buildings were knocked down in 2010. Longlands School Longlands School was a secondary school located in Stourbridge, West Midlands, England. It was built in 1912 to serve the expanding Stourbridge area as a secondary modern school. The school later gained comprehensive status, but by the 1980s, pupil numbers were falling. Dudley MBC decided to merge Longlands with nearby High Park School, and the merger was completed in September 1990 when Ridgewood High School opened within the High Park buildings. The old Longlands School buildings were then taken over by Stourbridge College, who are still using the site as a campus after nearly 20 years, although it is set to close during the 2010s if plans to merge Stourbridge College with Dudley College go ahead. Mons Hill School Mons Hill School was a secondary school on the Wren's Nest Estate in Dudley, England. It was opened in April 1965 as Wrens Nest Secondary School, to replace Wolverhampton Street School (which had been open since 1880) in Dudley town centre, and gave education to pupils aged 11 to 16 years (with the starting age rising to 12 from September 1972). Construction had started during 1963 with the intention of having the school open for the beginning of the academic year in September 1964, but it missed the target completion date by seven months. On the introduction of comprehensive education across the Dudley borough in September 1975, it was renamed Mons Hill School. Soon afterwards, Mons Hill was widely regarded in the local area as the worst secondary school in the borough, and pupil numbers were falling and O-Level (GCSE from 1988) results were dismal. By September 1988, just over 200 pupils were on the school roll and Dudley council decided that the school was no longer viable and would close in July 1991, as part of a mass reorganisation of education in the borough, which involved several secondary schools being closed or merged, as well as the secondary school entry age in the north of the borough being reverted to 11, and the pupils to other local schools, as well as a smaller than expected number of 12-year-olds transferring to the school from primary schools in September 1989, enabling the closure date to be brought forward a year to July 1990, after which remaining pupils and staff were split between Castle High School and the Coseley School. This brought the future of the 25-year-old school buildings under uncertainty. The Coseley School expressed interest in using it as a temporary annex until adequate classroom space could be created at their Ivyhouse Lane site, and there was also a suggestion that some of the site could be incorporated into Wren's Nest Nature Reserve. However, in September 1990, it became a campus of Dudley College and a multi-million pound extension with high quality facilities for skilled trades such as construction, hairdressing and motor engineering, was completed in 1993. This replaced a previous annexe of Dudley College on nearby Sedgley Road West. However, most of the facilities were transferred to new buildings in Dudley town centre in September 2012. The bulk of the Mons Hill buildings were demolished three years later. Part of the site, including the Construction Centre, remained in use for a further six years, when further new buildings for Dudley College were opened in the town centre. These buildings were then taken over by the Wenlock School, which caters for pupils with special needs. The site of the demolished buildings has since been redeveloped for housing. Sam Allardyce, former manager of the England national football team, attended the school from 1966 to 1970. Park Secondary School Pensnett High School Richmond Boys School Rosland Secondary School St. Edmund's Primary School St. Edmund's Primary School was a primary school for pupils aged from 5 to 11 years. It was located in Dudley, West Midlands, England, and was opened during the 19th century. The school merged with St John's Primary School during the 1970s to become St Edmund's and St John's Primary School; it relocated to a site on Kates Hill. The old buildings of St Edmund's have been retained and are currently used as Dudley Central Mosque, although there have been ongoing plans for it to be relocated to a new site in nearby Dixon's Green. St James' School St John's Primary School St John's Primary School was a Church of England primary school situated in Dudley, West Midlands, England. It served the Kates Hill area of the town and was built in 1840 along with the neighbouring parish church on St John's Road. The area of Kates Hill was expanding as a residential area at this time, mostly housing workers who were moving into the Black Country during the Industrial Revolution. The school remained open for 130 years, finally closing in 1974(?) on its merger with St Edmund's Primary School (on Birmingham Street in the town centre) to form St Edmund's and St John's Church of England Primary School). The new school was located at a building on Hillcrest Road. The old St John's School, now 170 years old, is still in existence and for most of the time since the school's closure the buildings have been in commercial use. The current occupants of the building are a recruitment agency. Saltwells Secondary School Saltwells Secondary School was a secondary school located in Netherton, West Midlands, England. It was b 1962+ to replace Halesowen Road School - known locally as The Iron School due to its corrugated iron construction. The school closed in July 1986 due to falling numbers on the school roll, and most of the remaining pupils and staff were transferred to The Hillcrest School, now the only secondary school in Netherton. The school's status changed from secondary modern to comprehensive in September 1975 as part of a borough wide change to secondary education. The age range changed from 11-15/16 to 12-16 in September 1972, also to fit in with a reorganisation of local education (which was not reverted until 1990). The school buildings remain in use to this day as the site of Saltwells Education Development Centre - the educational development centre which serves the entire Dudley borough. Sir Gilbert Claughton School Sir Gilbert Claughton School was a secondary school located on Blowers Green Road in Dudley, England, in the Queen's Cross area of the town. It opened in 1904 and closed in 1990. It opened in 1904 as the Dudley Upper Standard School, but after three years it became the Higher Elementary School. Another name change came in 1929, when it became the Dudley Intermediate School. In December 1957, it adopted the Gilbert Claughton title as the Sir Gilbert Claughton Grammar Technical School. A new classroom block was added in the late 1950s, mostly for the teaching of Science and other practical subjects. The age range was altered from 11-18 to 12-18 in September 1972 and its status changed to comprehensive in September 1975. However, by the mid-1980s numbers were starting to fall and the sixth form centre had been axed, sparking fears that it would close. In 1985, there was talk of The Dudley School being merged with another local secondary school to form The Ednam School, and Sir Gilbert Claughton was one of the schools mentioned in the proposals for this new school. In 1988, there was talk of the school merging with The Blue Coat School on Kates Hill. However, in October 1988 Dudley council decided to merge the Dudley School with Blue Coat to form Castle High (at the main Dudley School site), which opened in September 1989, although Blue Coat would remain open for a year as an annex for the older pupils. In June 1989, just weeks before the end of the academic year, it was announced that all second year (12- to 13-year-old) and third year (13- to 14-year-old) pupils would be transferred from Sir Gilbert Claughton to Castle High or Holly Hall Schools with effect from September - along with the pupils starting secondary school at that time who had originally selected Sir Gilbert Claughton as their destination. However, the oldest remaining year group at the school would remain there until completing their secondary education in July 1990, when the school finally closed after 86 years. It was then turned into offices by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, who designated it as the Claughton Centre. Walton Girls School Walton Girls School was a girls secondary modern school situated in Halesowen, West Midlands, England. It was built during the 1930s to serve the central area of Halesowen. It remained open for some 50 years, and during the final years of its existence was the only all-girls secondary school in the Dudley borough (which Halesowen became part of in 1974). It was originally a school for girls aged 11 upwards, but was reorganised to a 13-18 comprehensive in September 1972, when three-tier education was introduced in Halesowen. It was reorganised into an 11-16 comprehensive in September 1982, when it gained two younger year groups but lost its sixth form as all of the town's sixth form facilities were relocated to an expanded Halesowen College. Walton finally closed its doors in July 1985 when it merged with nearby Richmond Boys School to form Windsor High School. The new school was located entirely at the Richmond site from its opening in September 1985, and the Walton buildings were taken over by Halesowen College, who retained it for 18 years before expanding their main Whittingham Road site, after which the Walton Campus was demolished and replaced by housing.

December 1910 The Vandalia Railroad Company was incorporated January 1, 1905, by a merger of several lines in Indiana and Illinois that formed a 471-mile railroad consisting of lines mostly west of Indianapolis. On January 1, 1917, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (the Panhandle) which the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) had acquired in 1868, was merged into the Vandalia Railroad to form the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad. This gave the PRR a direct route from New York City to St. Louis. In 1968, PRR merged with the New York Central (NYC) to become Penn Central (PC) and in 1976, becoming part of Conrail (CR). Much of the North-South line was abandoned with the Conrail formation but parts of the East-West line survive as part of CSX Transportation.  The Vandalia Railroad lineage  1896 Railroad map of Indiana. Detailed township and county map distinguishing railroads by color and name. Includes a list of railroads in left margin, coded by color. = Terre Haute and Richmond = The Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad was chartered in January 1847, with construction starting in late 1849. In February 1852, of track between Indianapolis and Terre Haute were completed. On March 6, 1865, the name was changed to the Terre Haute & Indianapolis Railroad. On April 26, 1870, an extension was finished from Terre Haute to the Illinois state line that met up with the St. Louis, Vandalia and Terre Haute. = Indianapolis and Vincennes = The Indianapolis and Vincennes was originally promoted as a route to the Gulf of Mexico when construction started in 1867, with the Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Lafayette Railroad providing financial help in return for a lease on the line. A.E. Burnside, major General in the Union Army during the Civil War, was an early promoter of the railroad. In 1868, two Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) companies were also added as guarantors for the line. The line was completed between its namesake cities in 1869, with the PRR taking control in 1871. The line, however, never reached the Gulf of Mexico as its promoters had planned. = Terre Haute and Logansport = In 1871, the initial section of the Terre Haute and Logansport Railroad connected Rockville, Crawfordsville, Frankfort, and Clymers, Indiana, which is southwest of Logansport. The railroad used trackage rights on a Wabash Railroad predecessor for four years until they built their own tracks into Logansport. The Terre Haute and Logansport then leased the segment of the Evansville and Crawfordsville Railroad that stretched from Rockville to Terre Haute in 1872. The Terre Haute and Logansport finished a line in 1884, that connected Logansport with South Bend. This line was also leased to the Terre Haute and Indianapolis, which in 1890, leased the Indiana and Lake Michigan Railway, giving it access to St. Joseph, Michigan. = Detroit, Eel River and Illinois = Completed in 1874, between Logansport and Butler, Indiana, the Detroit, Eel River and Illinois had been planned as a farm-to-market road. The Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific leased the line in 1879, to complete the middle link of a St. Louis–East Coast line. The lease was canceled after a long legal battle. The line was later reorganized as the Logansport and Toledo Railway and was bought by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1901.  Merger  Vandalia Railroad pass (1908) The Terre Haute & Indianapolis Railroad, the St. Louis, Vandalia & Terre Haute Railroad, the Terre Haute & Logansport Railway, the Logansport & Toledo Railway, the Indiana & Vincennes Railroad were all merged on January 1, 1905, to form the Vandalia Railroad Company. The railroad connected Indianapolis in the east with St. Louis in the west and South Bend and Butler in the north with Vincennes in the south.  Routes  The main East-West line ran from Indianapolis to St. Louis, with a major branch, the Terre Haute & Peoria Railroad, connecting Decatur, and Peoria, Illinois. The line was double-tracked for much of its length, serving the coal region of southern Illinois, and as a passenger route for the Pennsylvania Railroad's Blue Ribbon named trains, The St Louisan, the Jeffersonian, and the Spirit of St. Louis. The main North-South route ran from Terre Haute to Logansport and then to on to South Bend. Logansport was a PRR hub, with six branch lines radiating in all directions. Logansport also featured a yard and engine terminal. From Logansport, the line proceeded northward intersecting every major east-west trunk line including the PRR's main east-west route and PRR's \\"panhandle\\" route. Upon reaching South Bend, the line proceeded northward through an industrial corridor toward the Studebaker plant to a depot just short of South Bend Union Station. Because the New York Central (NYC) trackage was elevated, interchange with NYC and tenant Grand Trunk Western (GTW) was indirect via a west-routed branch that reached the Studebaker plant railroad, New Jersey, Indiana, and Illinois (NJI&I;) subsidiary of the Wabash Railroad, GTW, and NYC's Kankakee Belt Railroad subsidiary. PRR maintained few facilities other than the depot in town as there were no other connecting PRR lines in South Bend. From Logansport, the Logansport & Toledo Railway proceeded northeast to Butler, where it connected to the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway.  Equipment  The Vandalia Railroad was a PRR subsidiary for most of the twentieth century. PRR was known for equipment standardization and as such, all properties and subsidiaries operated with standardized PRR equipment.  Traffic  Freight traffic was the primary use of the Vandalia Railroad. Studebaker loaded trucks for shipment south. Passenger trains were operated, including football specials for the University of Notre Dame. The university is located a few miles north of the station.  Abandonment  Despite the shutdown of most Studebaker operations in South Bend, abandonment was delayed until the Conrail consolidation. At that time, Conrail had three routes to/through South Bend and the Vandalia Railroad was deemed redundant. It has been abandoned piecemeal from the city border northward, with online industries served from trains based on the former NYC territory.  Remnants  The depot in South Bend still stands as a business. The tracks to the South still stand to Ewing Street, but are not in use. The tracks west to the Kankakee Belt connection still stand and are rarely used.

Niemeyer's work is based on the observation of nature through the use of mathematics and, especially, the \\"Golden Section\\". He has experimented with various media such as photography and film video, and today, he principally uses painting to compose his graphic works. Niemeyer also realized sculptural objects and big scale project such as the land art \\"20 steps around the world\\".  Biography  Jo Niemeyer was born in 1946 in the German village Alf. He comes from a long-time artist family. His mother was a textile designer and worked in Saabrücken at the former State School for Art and Crafts, where she was in charge of a handloom weaving factory. His father began to paint at a relatively young age, in abstract and concrete art. Unfortunately, his paintings were considered to be degenerate and most of his works were destroyed or lost during WWII. After three years of studying photography and graphic art, Niemeyer executed his first geometrical painting in 1966. He travelled in several countries, including the United States and Canada, and in Scandinavia where he was particularly fascinated by nature. In 1967, he pursued his training in industrial design at the Finnish Institute for Art \\"Atheneum\\". He decided in 1970 to quit his job as professional photographer to become a full-time independent artist. In Finland, he met artist colleagues Lars-Gunnar Nordstrom and Matti Kujasalo, the former director of the Finnish Academy of Art in Helsinki. In the 80s, Kujasalo asked Niemeyer to lecture about different print techniques in the graphic art department. During this time, Niemeyer built up his knowledge of Finnish architecture. It was also in Helsinki in the late 60s that Niemeyer met his wife, Tuula Partanen. in 1972 she founded Edition Partanen which specialised in silkscreen prints and publication of graphic and art portfolios. The studio was established in South Germany with a showroom in Zurich, Switzerland. Edition Partanen collaborated with artists such as Rupprecht Geiger, Matti Kujasalo, Ilya Bolotowsky and Niemeyer himself. Niemeyer began to elaborate his big scale project \\"20 steps around the world\\" which would be installed in 1997 in the City of Ropinsalmi in Finland. In this project, he explained, the earth replaced the canvas. According to him, earth is the carrier of his artistic work being integrated into the creative process only by minimal changes. In the context of this work an arbitrarily defined route around the earth is divided systematically and exactly into 20 segments which develop to a dynamic, logarithmic progression according to the 'Golden Section'. The 20 steps are visualized by using an installation of 20 stainless-steel elements around the globe, precisely located on continents. The location of the points is achieved by using a computer and satellite navigation. Over the years, Niemeyer has held successful one-man and group shows in Scandinavia, Italy, Switzerland, Israel, USA, England, Japan, Argentina, and Finland. His murals in public buildings can be found in countries all around the world including Switzerland and Germany, and in Scandinavia. Featured in numerous international publications and films, his works are in public and private collections and museums including in Japan, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany and Austria. Today, Jo Niemeyer works and lives in Germany, France and Finland.  Work  From photography to painting Niemeyer's interest in photography came from a fortunate encounter with photographer Otto Steinert, the former director of the Saarbrücken School where Niemeyer's mother used to work. The young Niemeyer was amazed by the way photographs were developed and chose to be trained as a photographer. Thanks to photography, Niemeyer realized that there are many ways to see things, and this medium was his first creative expression. He experimented with various techniques and specialized in architectural photography. Niemeyer was interested in changeability of structure in photography, and the step forwards the free creation of such structure was a logical and natural one. Painting allows him to do so: creating a free composition of a picture. From science (the study of the Nature) to concrete art The essential element in Niemeyer's work is nature. Since childhood, he has loved skiing passionately and spend a considerable amount of time in the mountains. The images of snow, clouds and light-situations gave him the desire to study structure, space, movement and time. In his work, Niemeyer connects art and nature, between the artistic action and the experimental work. His artistic production, fundamentally based on natural principals and measures, is nothing more than a sequence of experimental steps which implies given and objective criteria and subjective factors in the same way. His work is based on events in nature and civilization as well as on communication with his colleagues of other disciplines. According to Niemeyer, the dual poles of nature and art are not only the basis of his experience but at the time also his central theme. His main interest is the perception of space, time, distances and proportion and forms the synthesis between art and nature which implies in the end a dialogue between man and nature. He considers land-art a kind of laboratory, a ground for experiments for aesthetic-artistic, political and ecological syntheses.

Zoosystema : 29(2): 281–364 p. 286–289 Description The white, turriculate shell grows to a length of 11.5 mm. The paucispiral protoconch has 1¾ whorls. The teleoconch consists of 3¼ rounded whorls with spiral ridges, axially crossed by 16 to 17 distinct ribs. The ribs become confused at the bottom of the body whorl. On the top of each whorl these ribs disappear into the flat sutural zone between the whorls. The aperture is ovoid with the outer lip lacking striae. The columella is strongly inclined abaxially showing two folds, with the rim of the siphonal canal forming the third fold. There is no umbilicus. Distribution Fossil shells from the Pliocene have been found in Italy and Southern Spain. Recent specimens have been found in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean along Mauritania and the Western Sahara. The few recent shells found may actually be fossils dredged up recently.  Scientific Classification  The Admetula italica is in the Animalia phylum of Mollusca, a prehistoric ancestor to many modern Cancellarioideas. The name italica refers to the location in which the first of these fossils were discovered by D'Ancona in 1872, who was the first to describe it.

Heritage and history Bassols 1790 was founded in Spain in the city of Vic. Francisco Bassols set up the first linen weaving mills in Spain. By 1830, his son and successor, José Bassols Soler had established an industrial scale linen mill with a large number of hand looms on San Pedro street. When Jose Bassols Soler died in 1883, he left the business in the hands of his son Ramon Bassols Torras. Ramon changed the name of the company to Hijo de J. Bassols and built a new larger factory in Moyá with hand looms. He also took advantage of the arrival of power looms and built a new factory with such looms in San Martin de Provensals. Building upon the remarkable initiative of Francisco and the conservative perseverance of Jose, Ramon Bassols Torras was \\"one of the first to apply modern mechanical methods to his industry and understood perfectly all the possibilities of flax spinning\\". In 1909, Ramon Bassols Torras transferred all three of his factories to Teià where they remain today. In 1888 and 1929, the company competed in national textile exhibitions obtaining gold medals in both. In 1935, Ramon Bassols Torras formed the present company called Hijo de J. Bassols, S.A. in which his children, José Maria Bassols Llata and Ramon Bassols Oliba worked as directors with their father. After surviving the Spanish Civil War and World War II, direction of the company was taken over by Jose Maria Bassols Llata in 1950. Under his leadership the company continued its focus on manufacturing and opened a jacquard weaving factory in Europe in 1960. This was followed by the launch of Bassols first tablecloth collection in 1969. In 1980 Bassols launched its first home textile collection and began a transition from a specialty linen manufacturer to a much broader based home textile brand. This transformation was accelerated under the direction of Jose Bassols Lopez de Sagredo and his brother Javier Bassols Lopez de Sagredo who took over from his father as President in 1992. Jose Bassols drove the process of changing the company culture from its manufacturing roots to being fashion, marketing and brand driven.

He is perhaps best known as a satirical etcher. Early life John Phillips was the son of Giles Firman Phillips (1780–1867), and Lydia Arnold. He was born 24 October 1808 in the Parish of St James, Westminster, and baptised 28 May 1809 in the Tottenham Court Chapel in Tottenham Court Road. His mother died in 1839 and John lived for a time with his father at 8 Leicester Square (1831) 8, Richmond Buildings, Dean Street, Soho (1832-3), 60 Frith Street Soho, (1837) 16 Brownlow Street, and later (1841,) at 85 Newman Street. His first print was published in 1825 at the age of 17. He published a number of satirical prints between 1825 and 1830 for G Humphrey and others. Phillips is known to have used the pseudonym \\"A. Sharpshooter\\", who published a series of prints through S Gans. After the demise of the satirical print in the 1830s he turned his hand to portraiture in the form of miniatures. Five have been identified to date (2011.) He also exhibited paintings and drawings at the Society of British Artists and the New Watercolour Society 1832-7. He co-operated with Alfred Crowquill (pseud. of Alfred Henry Forester 1804-72) in Geo William Reynolds \\"Pickwick Abroad, or a Tour in France\\" 1838, illustrated with 41 steel engravings by A Crowquill and John Phillips, and 33 woodcuts by Bonner.

Craig Lodge Family House of Prayer History Craig Lodge, a former hunting lodge in Dalmally, Argyll, Scotland, was run by Calum and Mary Anne MacFarlane-Barrow as a guest house until a pilgrimage to Medjugorje in 1984 gave their lives a new direction. It was their children who first read about the events at Medjugorje, and the reports that the Virgin Mary was appearing to six teenagers. They had grown up in a Catholic family and were well versed in the stories of Marian apparitions at Lourdes and Fatima. They were intrigued with the idea something like this could happen in their own time and were determined to go and visit and find out more. The visit to Medjugorje, a small village in Bosnia-Herzegovina, was a life changing experience. The region was then still part of Communist Yugoslavia and to practice the Catholic faith often met with persecution. Seeing the deep faith of the local people and hearing about the extraordinary events firsthand left a lasting impression on the group. They also learnt about the messages the Virgin Mary, under the title, Queen of Peace, was giving through the visionaries. As in Lourdes and Fatima her message at Medjugorje continues to be a call to return to the gospel values; to decide for God, to pray and to fast. When they returned home they urged their parents to go and visit Medjugorje too. Their experiences in Medjugorje paved the way for Calum and Mary Anne taking the decision to turn their guest house into a retreat centre – Craig Lodge Family House of Prayer. Guests come to join in with organized retreats or just to enjoy the beautiful, peaceful surroundings and take part in the Community’s daily prayer routine. In 1990 Calum and Mary Anne invited a group of young people to form a youth community (named Krizevac Community) at Craig Lodge. The commitment was for one year and the purpose was to deepen their faith through living out the messages of Medjugorje. “Dear Children my heart is full of grace and love. My heart is the gift I give you. Be united! Pray together! Love together!” The Community today The Community soon began to get involved in evangelizing other young people through youth weekend retreats at Craig Lodge, visiting parishes and initiating prayer groups. Ten years later in 2000, it was decided the Community should incorporate Permanent members too – families, single people or religious who choose to renew their commitment annually. This is Craig Lodge Community as it is today. While members of the House Community live in Craig Lodge itself and commit to one year, Permanent members live independently, in their own homes, close by to Craig Lodge. Their daily commitment is different to that of the House Community to take into account family and work responsibilities. The purpose of the Community The purpose of the Community is to foster holiness in the members by living out the messages of the Virgin Mary at Medjugorje. Living in community has always been recognized as a way of progressing in the spiritual life. It is a way of finding companions on the journey of faith, of supporting each other and helps to open hearts to Jesus and to others. The understanding is that people are the pathway to the growth of virtue in each of us. \\"Pray, pray, pray.\\" Daily Life Prayer is integral to the daily life of the Community: Divine Office, the Rosary, Praise and Worship, Lectio Divina, Intercessory prayer particularly for priests. If prayer is the breath of the Community then the Eucharist is the heart. Daily life centres on the Holy Mass and Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. “Today I invite you all to fall in love with the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar. Adore him, little children, in your parishes. In this way you will be united with the entire world. Jesus will become your friend and you will not talk of Him as someone you hardly know. Union with him will be a joy for you and you will become witnesses to Jesus’ love which he has for every creature. Little children when you adore Jesus you are also close to me.” The overarching rule of the Community is to love: “Love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins, offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each one should use whatever gifts he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God’s grace in its various forms.\\" 1 Peter 4: 8-11 Service The Community’s life has a strong calling to service. First and foremost by offering hospitality to the guests who come on retreat at Craig Lodge; by praying with them and making them feel at home. The Community is committed to youth work running several youth events each year at Craig Lodge – Easter, Summer & Advent. There is also an outreach team that carries out missions in secondary schools. The Community has a popular music ministry that leads the lively weekly praise and worship prayer group and is a hallmark of the Craig Lodge youth events. The Community is also eager to support family life and makes special efforts to make families welcome at Craig Lodge. Over the last years it has developed Family Week retreats that are geared to the needs of young families and include talks for parents alongside activities for the children. The patron saints of Craig Lodge Community are: Our Lady Queen of Peace, St Joseph and St Therese of Lisieux. Craig Lodge Family House of Prayer Retreats As a Roman Catholic retreat centre, Craig Lodge has a wide variety of retreats throughout the year. They cover topics such as: healing, Scripture, Theology of the Body, Pope John Paul II, Ignatius Spiritual Exercises and fasting.

Ferscha became responsible for group-wide treasury and asset/liability management of Erste Bank in 1994. =Goldman Sachs= In 1997 Ferscha joined the Goldman Sachs Group LLP, initially in London, and in 1998 joined Goldman Sachs oHG Bank's management board in Frankfurt, as finance director and chief operating officer. He also became the co-managing director of their Frankfurt derivatives and warrants sales and trading. =Eurex/Deutsche Börse AG= Ferscha joined Deutsche Börse AG as an executive board member from Goldman Sachs, their investment bankers, shortly before the company's IPO. From 2000 to 2005 he was CEO of Eurex, then the world's largest Futures Exchange, co- owned 50/50 (profit distribution: 80/20) by Deutsche Börse AG and SWX Swiss Exchange respectively, and CEO of Eurex Clearing AG as well as CEO of the Swiss derivatives exchange Eurex Zürich. From 2003 he ran the Xetra division of Deutsche Börse AG and served as Chairman of the Management Board of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The Eurex and Xetra divisions accounted for more than half of Deutsche Börse AG's revenues. Ferscha focused on profitability, global distribution, and on organic growth. The extension to foreign markets yielded market share gains in international index contracts like the EuroStoxx 50, as well as in Dutch, French and Italian equity options. In 2002 Eurex became the highest volume equity options exchange. The share of Eurex products sold to US customers grew from 5% in 2000 to 25% in 2005, as well as a profit growth from eur 38m in 1999 to 175m in 2005. Ferscha propagated equal and open access to financial markets through a global liquidity network. He also proposed comprehensive regulation to capture systemic risk, as well as a balanced approach towards hedge fund regulation and a more inclusive approach to the over-the-counter markets. Eurex developed its own over-the-counter electronic trading platforms; Eurex Bonds and Eurex Repo, and included 17 US brokers, clearers and banks in the shareholder base of EurexUS. The Futures Industry Association, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and German Finance Minister Hans Eichel supported its application to become a US- regulated exchange. In negotiating a 15% participation in The Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, Ferscha obtained Eurex's access to clearing directly in the US and the market-user shareholders of that company guaranteed EurexUS's turnover for the first three years. The shareholders of the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation voted for the Eurex deal and against an unsolicited take- over offer from the Chicago Board of Trade. Ferscha hired Goldman Sachs futures head Michael McErlean and the head of Chicago Mercantile Exchange's product development division Satish Nandapurkar to lead the Eurex US, 70% of which was sold to Man Group for $23.2 million 2 years later. Ferscha reformed the allocation of specialist mandates on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to individual brokers according to performance criteria and opened the specialist roles to firms headquartered outside Germany. When mandating the redesign of the interior of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange building in 2005 he preserved the traditional trading floor of the exchange and its trademark magnetic blackboard. He introduced the new market segment Entry Standard in to cater for smaller and less mature businesses, following the earlier closure of the \\"Neue Markt\\". The Entry Standard attracted 71 listings in its first year, becoming the largest alternative investment market in continental Europe. Ferscha was reported to be a potential candidate to assume the Deutsche Borse AG CEO role after the company's CEO Werner Seifert and Chairman Rolf Breuer left in 2005, pressured by funds including TCI and Atticus Ferscha lost out on this role to Reto Francioni, then chairman of SWX Swiss exchange, Deutsche Borse's junior partner in Eurex. The hedge funds proposed Hypo Real Estate's Kurt Viermetz as Chairman, who hired, Francioni as CEO in November 2005. In December 2005 Ferscha resigned from the Deutsche Borse Group, followed by several other senior management departures He was succeeded by Frank Gerstenschlager, who was given the responsibility for the Xetra-division (equities, funds and warrants), and also by Andreas Preuss who was given responsibility for the Eurex division (derivatives and clearing). =Gledhow Capital, Moody's, Flow Traders= In 2006 he became a Partner at Gledhow Capital Partners, and has been an independent board director at rating agency Moody's Investors Service Limited, Moody's Investors Service EMEA Limited, Moody's France SAS and Moody's Deutschland since 2013 as well as a member of the supervisory board of DEAG Classics AG. Since 2015 he has been a member of the supervisory board of Flow Traders, chairing the remuneration and appointment committee . He served as an independent supervisory board member of 360 Treasury Systems AG until the company was sold to Deutsche Börse AG in 2016. Other Interests In May 2010 he was appointed to the Professional Oversight Board of the Financial Reporting Council, the independent UK regulator for corporate governance and corporate reporting.

After major and large earthquakes, rescue agencies and civil defense managers rapidly need quantitative estimates of the extent of the potential disaster, at a time when information from the affected area may not yet have reached the outside world. For the injured below the rubble every minute counts. To rapidly provide estimates of the extent of an earthquake disaster is much less of a problem in industrialized than in developing countries. This article focuses on how one can estimate earthquake losses in developing countries in real time.  The need for theoretically estimating human losses in real time  For the first few days after an earthquake, practically no information flows from the center of the devastated area. Examples of the initial underestimation of the extent of earthquake disasters in developing as well as industrialized countries are shown in Figure 1. The responsible experts believed for 4 days that the death toll in the Wenchuan earthquake, Mw 8 of May 12, 2008, was less than 10,000. Speedy arrivals of medical teams and other first responders is essential for saving injured from dying and helping others to get care. Theoretical estimates of the numbers of fatalities and injured within less than an hour of a large earthquake is the only information that can guide first responders to where and how large a disaster has struck. For this reason, the QLARM and the PAGER teams maintain around the clock capabilities to calculate earthquake damage and casualties within less than 1 hour of any earthquake worldwide. No other groups are capable of these detailed analyses.Wyss, M. (2004), Earthquake loss estimates in real-time begin to assist rescue teams, worldwide, EOS, 85(52), 567.Wyss, M. (2014), Ten years of real-time earthquake loss alerts, in Earthquake Hazard, Risk, and Disasters, edited by M. Wyss, pp. 143-165, Elsevier, Waltham, Massachusetts. This page can help medical and other responders understand how fast and how accurate loss estimates can be calculated after earthquakes and what should be added to be more helpful. The estimates of fatalities distributed by email by the QLARM team of the International Centre for Earth Simulation Foundation (ICES)http://icesfoundation.org/Pages/Home.aspx within 100 minutes of the Wenchuan earthquake was 55,000 ± 30,000, which includes the final toll of about 87,000. For the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, an M6.3 earthquake, QLARMs estimate of fatalities was 275 ±200, 22 minutes after the event.3. List of alerts can be found on www.wapmerr.org. The final death toll was 287. In both cases, the official fatality count was slow to reflect the true extent of the disasters. Thus, theoretical estimates of fatalities in real time can be useful for reacting with an appropriate disaster relief response, even though these estimates have large error margins. Current QLARM alerts can be found on the International Institute for Earth Simulation Foundation website, the alarms by the United States Geological Survey PAGER team are found on their website.  Pinpointing the hypocenter and magnitude The location of an earthquake (its epicenter and depth) needs to be known rapidly for estimating losses. It is calculated from the times at which the waves it generates arrive at seismographs surrounding the source. A computer moves the epicenter estimate close to those stations which record the waves first and far from stations that reported the waves later. This can be done within seconds to accuracies of 1 kilometer in regions where dense seismograph networks exist with inter-station distances of about 10 km.Allen, R. M., and H. Kanamori (2003), The potential for earthquake early warning in Southern California, Science, 300, 786-789 For most of the world, this luxury is not available and the worldwide seismograph network has to be used to estimate the location based on teleseismic data (recorded at distances of more than 1,000 km). This means that estimates of the location cannot be calculated before the waves have traveled hundreds and thousands of kilometers to stations that record them. = The race to know about a new earthquake = The following agencies distribute estimates of latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude of worldwide earthquakes rapidly and with high accuracy. The Geoforschungszentrum, Potsdam, Germany, delivers automatic solutions within 7 minutes (median) for all major earthquakes worldwide. The National Earthquake Information Center of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) delivers solutions that are reviewed by a seismologist within 18 minutes (median) for all major earthquakes worldwide. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre delivers reviewed parameters mostly in the European area within 21 minutes (median). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the National Tsunami Warning Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) delivers reviewed parameters for earthquakes in the wider Pacific area within 9 minutes (median). These are updated numbers, slightly shorter than discussed in detail earlier. = Epicenter = If the epicenter is incorrect the loss estimate will be uncertain. Errors are introduced in the estimate of position mostly because of the heterogeneity of the Earth. Seismic waves travel with different speeds in different rocks. Uncertainties in real time epicenters estimated by teleseismic means are ±25 km (median).Wyss, M., Elashvili, M., Jorjiashvili, N. & Javakhishvili, Z. (2011). Uncertainties in teleseismic epicenter estimates: implications for real-time loss estimate, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, in press. = Depth = The depth is important, but uncertain in the top 50 km. The depths of earthquakes range from 0 to about 700 km. Generally, only the earthquakes in the top 100 km are close enough to settlements to cause casualties. The decrease of the wave amplitudes as a function of distance (Figure 2) shows that dangerous intensities, I≥VII, do not exist beyond 30 to 50 km for major earthquakes. Thus, deep earthquakes are usually not of interest for alerts. The depth of the energy release can be estimated accurately (to within 1 km) if a seismograph station right above the earthquake (or near it) records the waves. This is usually not the case and one has to rely on teleseismic methods to estimate the depth. The teleseismic method is to measure the time delay with which the wave reflected from the Earth's surface above the earthquake arrives at a seismograph. The surface of the Earth acts like a mirror. A wave that runs up against it cannot travel into the air, so it is reflected back down into the Earth, traveling to the same seismograph that recorded the direct wave a little bit earlier. The time delay of the reflected wave depends of course directly on the extra distance it has traveled: from the hypocenter up to the surface and back down to the depth of the hypocenter. This method works fine, if the hypocentral depth Z>50 km because, in that case, the direct and reflected phases (waves) are clearly separated on the record. For shallower depths, the delay is so small that the two pulses on the seismogram are not readily recognizable as separate pulses; it takes filtering techniques to separate and identify them. It follows that the depth of the shallow earthquakes, those most dangerous, must be assumed to be 25 ±25 km, if there is no other evidence available. This uncertainty is approximately the same as that of the epicenter. There exists a possibility to reduce this error based on historic data, in some cases. For regions where the tectonic style and the faults producing the earthquakes are well known, one may choose a depth assuming it is the same as in past earthquakes for which the depth had been determined accurately. = Magnitude = For earthquake with magnitudes smaller than M7.5, the different agencies mentioned above as issuing location estimates, usually distribute values of M within 0.2 units from each other. For these medium-sized earthquake, the average of the estimates is a reliable determination of the earthquake size. However, for great earthquakes approaching M8 and exceeding it, the initial estimate of M is often significantly too small. This is so because the surface wave M, which is quickly obtained, is defined as proportional to the 20 sec Reighly surface wave, and this wave has a wavelength of about 100 km. It is therefore too short to reliably measure the M of an earthquake rupture exceeding 100 km. In these cases, an in depth analysis, which takes time, is needed to arrive at the correct M. As an example, the Wenchuan earthquake of 12 May 2008 had originally been assigned M7.5 in real-time. Later estimates were M7.9 to M8.0. Based on the first estimate, fatalities had been expected to reach a maximum of 4,000, based on the second the maximum had been calculated as 100,000. The observed number of fatalities in this case was 87,000, determined after months (see Figure in the introduction of this page). Estimates of shaking  The magnitude for great earthquakes is often underestimated, at first. The standard teleseismic measure of the ‘size’ of an earthquake is the surface wave magnitude, , which has to be derived by definition from the surface waves with 20 second period. A more reliable and more modern scale is that of the moment magnitude, . Variations of the amplitudes recorded at different seismograph stations are due to many reasons, but the mean magnitude derived from reports by many stations that have recorded the earthquake should be fairly stable. Nevertheless, the agencies which report source parameters (GFZ, NEIC, TWC. EMSC) differ in their magnitude estimates by 0.2 units, on average. This value is taken as the uncertainty of the magnitude estimate in real time. There exists a special problem for great earthquakes; those with M>8. The waves with 20 seconds period, which define , have wavelengths of only about 100 km. This means, they are too short a yardstick to measure the size of ruptures that significantly exceed 100 km in length. For this reason was introduced, being based on wavelengths of about 1000 km. Unfortunately, these long wavelengths do not become available as fast as shorter ones, resulting in initial underestimates of the magnitude of great earthquakes. As an example, for the Tohoku, M9 earthquake of 11 March 2011, the initial estimates were: GFZ M8.5, NEIC M7.9, TWC M7.9, and EMSC M8.0. = The intensity of shaking diminishes away from the earthquake = Strong ground motions damage buildings, sometimes bringing about collapse. Shaking of the ground decreases with distance from the release of energy, the hypocenter, or, more accurately expressed, from the entire area of rupture. To calculate the intensity of shaking at a given settlement, the computer looks up the attenuation (decrease in amplitude) for seismic waves that travel the distance to the settlement in question. Such calculations are similar to those made to assess the seismic hazard, part of the field of engineering seismology. Errors are again introduced through the heterogeneity of the Earth. The loss of energy along the wave path is not exactly the same in all parts of the world.Seismic Waves and Earth's Interior, An Introduction to Earthquakes, Saint Louis University.Project Activity and Findings, Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER), in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey and the Southern California Earthquake Center. Examples are shown in Figure 2. For poorly studied regions in developing countries, the uncertainty of the estimated intensities can be substantial, as shown by the different curves, because attenuation is poorly known. Another factor that can lead to variations of observed intensity of shaking is the condition of the soil beneath a particular structure. The waves are amplified in unconsolidated soils compared to hard rock (Figure 3). In important cities, soil conditions and their amplification factors are mapped for microzonation purposes. This type of information is usually not available for settlements in developing countries. One has to assume that the mixture of conditions results in an average loss estimate for the city, overall. An intensity, I, given in Roman numerals from I to XII, is calculated for each settlement, accounting for the magnitude of the earthquake and its distance, and also accounting for the local amplification, if known. Built environment The built environment is poorly known for some countries. The quality of buildings differs by country and settlement size. For estimating damage to the built environment, one needs to calculate the damage expected for each type of building present in a given settlement. For each settlement one needs to know the distribution of buildings into classes with different resistance to strong shaking. A common scale for classifying building types is the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS98)Gruenthal, G., (1998). European Macroseismic Scale 1998. in Cahiers du Centre Européen de Géodynamique et de Séismologie, Conseil de l'Europe, Luxembourg. The distribution of building types is different in industrialized and developing countries (Figure 4) and also in villages compared to cities in the same country. Many earthquake engineers work on the problem of better defining the world data on building properties.Porter, K. A., K. S. Jaiswal, D. J. Wald, M. Greene, and C. Comartin (2008). WHE-PAGER Project: a new initiative in estimating global building inventory and its seismic vulnerability, 14th World Conf. Earthq. Eng., Beijing, China, Paper S23-016 After one knows the distribution of buildings into classes (histograms on the left in both frames of Figure 4), one needs to estimate how the population is distributed into these building types (histograms on the right in both frames of Figure 4). These distributions are not identical because the higher quality houses tend to shelter more people per building. The Haiti earthquake, M7.3 of 12 January 2010 showed that in this case the quality of construction was vastly underestimated by the engineering community. Each new damaging earthquake serves as a source of new information on building properties in the region. In the immediate aftermath of the Haiti earthquake of 12 January 2010, a joint study for the estimation of damage to the building stock based on aerial images was carried out by UNITAR-UNOSAT, the EC-JRC, and the World Bank/ImageCAT in support of the PDNA. Hancilar et al. (2013) have developed empirical fragility functions based on remote sensing and field data for the pre-dominant building typologies. The international project Global Earthquake Model (GEM) has the aim of producing a world map of earthquake risk. As part of this gigantic effort, data sets will be improved, which are also needed for real time loss assessments. One of these is the data set on world housing properties. = Deaths from collapsing buildings = The probability that a building of a given type may collapse if subjected to a certain intensity of shaking (Figure 5) is an important parameter for calculating expected human losses. The weak buildings that are present in developing countries (Figure 4 on the left) are the ones that are likely to collapse at moderate intensities (Figure 5 on the left). The numbers of fatalities and injured (casualties are the sum of these two parameters) are estimated, using a casualty matrix, a table which gives the percentages of dead, injured, and unscathed among the occupants of a building that collapses. This distribution depends strongly on the building type. A building need not collapse to injure and kill; at every damage degree there exists a probability that casualties will result. The data in casualty matrices are so poorly known that we cannot give uncertainties here. However, specialists are working on learning more about this and related problems in estimating losses due to earthquakes.Spence, R., So, E. & Scawthorn, C., Human Casualties in Natural Disasters: Progress in Modeling and Mitigation. in Advances in Natural and Technological Hazards ResearchSpringer, Cambridge, UK., 2011.Spence, R.J.S. & So, E.K.M., Human casualties in earthquakes: modelling and mitigation. in Ninth Pacific Conference on Earthquake Engineering, Auckland, New Zealand, in press, 2011. Tracking population and location = Population at risk in a given quake = One would think that one can simply look up the population in all settlements of a country in its census. However, that is not the case for the countries we are targeting. Data sources on the web include the World Gazetteer, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and GeoNames for population by settlements. However, these lists are incomplete, omitting small settlements. In many countries the sum of the population listed by the above-mentioned organizations equals only 50% to 80% of the total population as estimated in The World Factbook of the CIA. Also, many settlements are listed without coordinates, and others with coordinates but not population. = Occupancy rate = Variations of occupancy rate as a function of the time of day and the season. The worst time for an earthquake to strike is the night because most of the population is indoors. The time when the consequences are less serious are the morning and evening hours, when farmers are out of doors and office and factory workers are commuting. The fluctuations in occupancy rate have been estimate to be about 35%. In areas with strong seasonal tourism, the population may fluctuate up to a factor of 10. These fluctuations depend strongly on the location. Currently, there exists no worldwide dataset to account for this effect in loss estimates. Simplifications Simplifications are needed because the world is too large for details everywhere. = Averaging = If one wanted to estimate in real time what damage is to be expected for critical facilities (e.g. a nuclear power plant, a high dam of a reservoir, bridges, hospitals, schools) one would have to know quite a few additional details. For example, the type of soil the facility is resting on, the blueprints of the construction to calculate its response to different frequency waves, and the frequency spectrum radiated by the earthquake. It can be done, but it is costly. In developing countries, not all of this information is available. In estimating losses in real time, one must take advantage of the fact that some buildings are built to code, others are not, some are located on hard rock, others on unconsolidated sediments, and the earthquake may radiate more energy in one direction than in another. Summing up expected losses assuming average conditions may end up approximately correct, although local fluctuations in the results exist. = Models for settlements = Figure 6: Photograph from space showing that neighborhoods of relatively homogeneous building stock can be defined, and that industrial buildings can be distinguished from residential ones. (Source: WAPMERR, Geneva, www.wapmerr.org). Figure 7: Using shadows cast by the buildings, a 3D model of the built environment of Bucharest has been constructed. The percentages of buildings in height classes can thus be derived for a city and its districts (district limits are marked by red lines). This information helps to define the distribution of buildings into classes of vulnerability to strong shaking, if some basic engineering information on the construction types present is available from street surveys. (Source: WAPMERR, Geneva, www.wapmerr.org). Photographs taken from space or from air planes are very useful for assembling a database for the built environment of a city. Even on images which have not been enhanced the size and type of buildings, as well as the building use can clearly be identified (Figure 6). Neighborhoods of residential buildings all of similar construction, and industrial zones can be mapped. The height of buildings can be estimated from the shadows they cast in photographs from space and from the air. Based on height, estimates 3D models of cities can be constructed, as shown in the example of Central Bucharest (Figure 7). Governmental office buildings can be seen at the center, whereas small residential buildings dominate in the East. Adding photographs of the facades shot from street level, detailed, realistic models of cities can be built (Figure 8). With this added information, it is possible to better classify the construction type of each building and to deepen the detail of the model of the built environment necessary for accurate estimates of losses due to earthquakes. However, the number of settlements in the world for which population data are available exceeds one million. For each, coordinates, name, and an estimated population is available, but it is impossible to analyze all of them in the detail as shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8. There is no choice, but to place the entire population at one coordinate point, regardless of the settlement's size, and to assign each settlement a standard distribution of buildings into classes of different earthquake resistance. The only refinement one can afford is to have different standard models for different countries and for at least three settlement size for each country. In an ideal case, one would like to have detailed information on every building and its occupants. However, with thousands of large cities at risk and hundreds of millions of inhabitants in them, this is too costly. A cost- effective way to model a large city is to treat each administrative district as a separate settlement. = Expected mortality by city district = In many large cities, the census contains information on population and building stock by district. A model of a city in which each district has its own distribution of buildings into classes and its population, is far superior to the basic, primitive model of one coordinate point. If one has the resources to divide a large city into neighborhoods containing similar building stock, then a high quality model can be constructed at a still moderate cost. An example of the mortality rate estimates in case of a future M8 earthquake off Lima, Peru, shows that there are substantial differences between districts (Figure 9). The differences are due to the distance from the assumed source, the type of soil, and the quality of the building stock. In addition to the mortality calculation for the entire population, information on the locations and expected damage state of schools, hospitals, fire stations, police posts, and critical facilities would be of great value for rescuers. However, to develop this type of information requires a more substantial effort in countries where the location and construction quality of these facilities are not known. Calculating the likely functionality of hospitals after earthquakes requires specialized expertise. In some cities, elaborate efforts by commercial enterprises have been carried out or are under way to catalog information on a neighborhood level, more detailed than shown in Figure 9. In industrial countries details of each house with street address are often known.  State of the art  = Uncertainties in real-time estimates = Uncertainties in real-time estimates of human losses are a factor of two, at best. One may group the seriousness for introducing errors in the loss estimates due to uncertain input, into three classes: serious, moderate, and negligible. The size of the most serious errors is an order of magnitude (meaning a factor of 10). They can be generated by hypocenter errors, incorrect data on building stock, and magnitude errors for M>8 earthquakes. Wrong assumptions on the attenuation of seismic waves may introduce errors of a factor of 3. Moderate errors, typically about 30%, can be introduced by variations of magnitude for M<8, soil conditions, and directivity of energy radiated. Other inaccuracies in data sets or input contribute errors that are negligible compared to the aforementioned uncertainties.Wyss, M., G. Trendafiloski, M. Elashvili, N. Jorjiashvili, and Z. Javakhishvili The mapping of teleseismic epicenter errors into errors in estimating casualties in real time due to earthquakes worldwide, abstract, presented at European Geosciences Union General Assembly, Vienna, EUG2011-9938, April 4, 2011. = Existing earthquake loss alert services = By email, the QLARM team is distributing estimates of human losses (numbers of fatalities and injured), in addition to calculations of mean damage for each settlement in their database, following earthquakes worldwide since October 2003. Up to May 2010, these estimates were based on a program and data set called QUAKELOSS, since that time the alerts are based on the second generation tool and data set called QLARM, including a map showing the mean damage expected for affected settlements. The first 10 years of near- real-time earthquake alerts by this team can be found in. Recent alerts can be found on the web page of the International Centre for Earth Simulation Foundation (ICES), Geneva. The National Earthquake Information Center of the USGS has been issuing PAGER alerts by email since April, 2009. They contain a color code reflecting the seriousness of the event, the number of people estimated to have been exposed to the various likely intensity levels, tectonic information about the epicentral area, and consequences that had resulted from previous nearby earthquakes. Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS)) has been issuing color-coded earthquake alerts since September 2005. These reports contain comments on the socio-economic conditions of the epicentral area. As a measure of the level of seriousness, they use only the number of people within set radii of distance. This information can be misleading because the parameters, which control the extent of a disaster, are ignored (magnitude, depth, transmission properties, building stock characteristics, and time of day). = Estimating losses due to tsunami = The methods explained here concern only losses due to strong ground motions. Damage due to tsunamis is not included. The community researching tsunamis is currently struggling with the problem of making a rapid decision after an earthquake whether or not a tsunami has been generated, how high it might be in the open ocean, and finally what local run ups should be expected. Methods to calculate what happens to the built environment when a wave strikes are not yet developed. = Improvements in accuracy = Human losses can be estimated with sufficient accuracy to assist disaster response to mobilize in adequate ways. Inconsequential events can be identified in 99% of the cases, which means that rescue teams do not need to waste time and energy to needlessly mobilize. Although the uncertainties in estimating human losses in real time are large, they allow one to immediately identify disastrous cases that need attention. Some of the uncertainties in the input parameters cannot be improved and will remain as error sources. However, the uncertainty in other parameters, especially databases, can be reduced by research. Some of the important parameters have hardly been investigated. Because many people are working on this problem, real time estimates of human losses after earthquakes will become more accurate and more useful.

It occupies an area of woodland at the end of a narrow ridge. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, meaning that it is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. The site lies in an area of woodland at the south eastern end of a narrow ridge with steep slopes around it. There is a outer bank which is long with a shallow wide ditch. Some Roman silver coins were found at the site in the late 18th century. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\".

Glass (1874 - November 14, 1967) was a Southern Baptist missionary in China with the North China Mission with his primary ministry being established in then Hwanghsien, China. He was best known in China by his local name Kuo Mu-Shih. Glass was dearly loved by Chinese and missionaries alike and was considered the rock in which the missionaries were held together in Hwanghsien and the light that led so many to Christ. His primary work was teaching and then leading the North China Mission's Seminary in Hwanghsien which produced many strong leaders of Christ. He had a great heart for the poor and headed up many famine relief projects and, with his colleagues and some of the native believers, helped to establish a Red Cross Organization. This gave him good standing personally and provided \\"great face\\" for himself and foreigners in general among many of the Chinese. Although he was one of the lesser known missionaries to China during this period, he nonetheless produced some of the greatest work. His daughter Eloise Glass Cauthen, who wrote his biography in her book Higher Ground, and her husband Baker James Cauthen (an official in the Southern Baptist Convention Foreign Mission Board) followed faithfully in his footsteps and greatly served the Chinese for many years. It can be sure that Wiley Glass's years of faithful service are a reason that the Chinese Church has such a solid foundation and has exploded the way it has. Early life Born in Franklin County, Texas to Henry Clay and Teedie Glass, Wiley was the subject of his mother's fervent prayers, as she prayed that her son would not grow up in his father's unbelief. She prayed, \\"O God, take this child, keep him and use him. And save his father, please.\\" Not much later his father had a powerful conversion experience and lived a life surrendered to the Lord. Years later on the way to a Methodist revival meeting, Glass's sister pleaded with him to give his life to Christ. The following morning the preacher spoke on the Revelation 3:20, and Glass let the Lord know he needed and wanted him, and in that moment he knew the Lord had heard and he walked forward and gave his life to Christ. Later Glass was asked to lead a church. After serious prayer he felt called, and through preaching in the church got his call to go to Baylor College. While he was at Baylor, one of Glass's professors, Dr. Tanner, the man who had the most profound influence on his life said, after hearing news of the Boxer Rebellion, a military uprising in which Chinese Christians and \\"foreign\\" missionaries were killed, \\"These things are added proof of [China's] need of the gospel. If China had been Christian, this would not be happening.\\" This moved Glass to become more zealous about foreign missions. (p. 33) Soon afterwards a revival on campus brought many Baylor students, including Wiley Glass, to a sense of a calling to missions. After marrying Eunice Taylor on July 22, 1903, Glass set out for China with his new bride. Work in China The Glasses began working with the Southern Baptist Convention's North China Mission and were first set up in LaiChowFu to study language. Wiley and Eunice had their first baby, Taylor, in August. Unfortunately he caught pneumonia. By the time Wiley could reach the doctor on his new bicycle and come back with him, Taylor was too sick and later died. This was a tragic time, but soon after Wiley was blessed and his language improved. He helped his Chinese teacher give up bad habits and got him reading the Gospel of John. This was the first man he led to Christ. Soon through the work of the Holy Spirit and the Chinese teacher Mr. Sun, nearly the whole village of forty to fifty families was led to Christ. In 1906 Wiley and Eunice had their second child and named him Bentley. Later in 1907, when the World Missions Conference was held in Shanghai, Glass represented the North China Mission. By this time, 100 years after Robert Morrison arrived from England as the first Protestant missionary to China, there were nearly a quarter of a million Christians in China (much more than were ever hoped for). Shortly after the conference the dikes in the Yellow River burst and destroyed many homes and drowned thousands. Glass and fellow missionary John Lowe went to Chingkiang and volunteered to help the victims. Horror, death, misery, and starvation were all around. This extremely challenging and exhausting time for Glass helped to raise support and awareness for China and to attract additional missionaries, and it also increased Chinese respect for \\"foreigners.\\" After weeks as a relief worker, Glass returned home, and his first daughter, named Lois Corneille, was born not long afterward on November 25, 1907. In 1908 a new step in Glass's mission career happened - he became part of the staff for the North China Baptist Training School for Preachers and Teachers in Hwanghsien. Glass felt that through teaching he could multiply himself by sending numerous native Chinese out to share the gospel. These Chinese Christian workers went throughout Shandong Provinces and into other provinces such as Henan and Anhwei and even up into the far areas of Manchuria. This was a delightful but also strenuous time for Glass. Lesson preparation took several hours, especially for Old Testament and church history classes, for which he had to learn countless names in Chinese. In this fruitful time, the student body quickly grew to 40. It was in Hwanghsien that the Glasses' second daughter, Eloise, named for Eunice's favorite sister-in- law, was born. After seven years in China and this newest addition to the family, Wiley, Eunice, and the children took their first furlough back to the United States in 1910. They had mixed emotions upon returning because Eunice's mother had died and her father had remarried. However Eunice loved her stepmother and spent a wonderful year with her while Wiley spent most of the time traveling in the Southern states, including Alabama, and traveled to Philadelphia and other Northern cities to tell what God was doing in China. Following their furlough, the Glasses returned to a much disturbed China, where the regime of the Empress Dowager was tottering and emerging plans for a modern China challenged old ways. Armed revolutionaries marched across Shandong Province, so the Glass family move to Chefoo where Eunice might be able to have her expected baby in peace. (p. 74) The seminary in Hwanghsien was closed during this time, and anyone without a hair queue was subject to beheading. Several Chinese Christians, sympathetic to the new movement, cut their hair. Because of this Wiley and his family felt they should return to Hwangsien to protect these men and to establish the Red Cross organization they were planning. The Glasses and Bessie Hartwell, a fellow missionary's wife, returned to Hwangshien despite the military conflict there. They connected with Lottie Moon at the Southern Baptist hospital in that city. By October 1912, cities in northern China had declared their sympathy with the revolution and ousted the imperial government officials. (p. 76). Eventually, however, imperialists took control of the city and many men not wearing queues were executed. Fortunately most Chinese Christians (some of whom had no queues) gained neutral status through their for the Red Cross and care for wounded soldiers, and so were not killed. Not much later Eunice got sick twice with pleurisy and their fourth child, Wiley, got dysentery and died not much later. Glass wrote home in his and his wife's name, \\"Heaven is nearer and Christ is dearer with our two boys over there in His arms.\\" His pain, however, appears in the letter's signature, \\"your sorrowing brother and sister\\" (p. 86). The following years in China were difficult. Famine followed revolution, drought extended for three years, and death was rampant in Central China and crept closer and closer their way. About this time the indomitable Lottie Moon became depressed amid the widespread distress. Her missionary colleagues decided that she should return to the United States, and she died on this ship home, in Kobe, Japan (p. 87). Despite these great pains and hardships, the ministry was blessed to be very fruitful during this time. According to Glass's daughter Eloise, \\"In Laichowfu a building had been dedicated for the Woman's Training School, and 2 churches had been organized. The North China Mission had 5 stations with work extending from Manchuria on the north to the extreme southwest of Shantung. There were 26 churches; they baptized 1003 during the year, about one fourth of the total membership. One day at Pingtu 130 were baptized… Sunday schools numbered 95. [The] 111 day and boarding schools had 1,848 pupils and 3 hospitals treated 25,800 patients\\" (p. 87-88). Later Eunice took the children on vacation to Chefoo and got deathly ill with a cold. She refused to leave China, not able to bear thinking about hindering her husband's work. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis and struggled for nine long months and on April 13 he would die. Glass wrote to his brother and sisters at home, \\"I would be untrue to her glorious, courageous example as she faced the future and endured for nine long months such weariness, pain and anxiety, so joyously, if I were not as brave as she. The inspiration of her pure, noble life is mine forever. I find God's face not turned from me, but a consciousness of His nearness and love and strength constantly at hand.\\" Still, Glass's grief and the strain of finances made it hard to push on (p. 92). He eventually decided to send his two remaining daughters to boarding school with his 8-year-old son Bentley. He was very lonely at Hwanghsien but a new seminary colleague and opportunities kept his mind busy, as he procured Christian literature for the churches, opened stores to sell this literature, and arranged for its distribution. (p. 92) Glass also began housing missionaries to fill his home, and he loved having his children home on holiday. His heart began to warm again, and in 1915 Glass became president of the North China Mission. A wonderful, enthusiastic, dearly loved, and dear lover of the Lord named Jessi Pettigrew was a missionary and nurse to the people of China and one of the women who so wonderfully took care of Wiley's children after the death of his beloved wife. After spending more time with her, Wiley fell deeply in love with her and after some years of hardship, eventually all former opposition approved and they married on March 13, 1916, in Japan. The children referred to her as \\"mother\\" as naturally as if they had never known her by any other name. (p. 103) and eventually they had two children of their own – Gertrude and Bryan in 1917 and 1919. Months later many continued to become Christians and were baptized in Hwangshien Church. Eventually there were so many that in a nearby port city, called Lung K'o (pu tong hua – Long Kou or Dragon's Mouth), the Lung K'o Baptist church was opened on November 7, 1916 and Wiley was chosen to be pastor and had a wonderful relationship with the church throughout his time in China. 1932, the year following a huge calamity and famine where Wiley was once again a wonderful but overwhelmed and exhausted relief work, was one of the sweetest and most special years in Wiley's work - revival broke out all around and numerous people came to Christ. There was incredible and deep confession of sin all around, people gained an incredible appreciation and zeal for the reading and spreading of the Truth, and many new students came to the seminary. This helped to prepare the people during the persecution when missionaries were forced to leave and financial support from abroad was taken away. (p. 156) Later, as Glass was pastor of Tengchow church (Lottie Moon's original post), revival continued to happen, the church was packed even during freezing weather, and many came to Christ. One man noted – \\"Christ was made real and precious. Opium smokers were delivered from their bondage, the lost were saved, Christians became witnesses, and churches were established that were self-supporting from the first.\\" Years later Hwanghsien came under Japanese control. Forty years of wonderful education work in that area came to a close when the authorities demanded that all Christian schools be closed and Confucianism was the way of life. On top of this there forty years of hospital work with Warren Memorial Hospital was closed after Japanese declared they could only see patients with a permit yet allowed no patient to ever have a permit. Following this Wiley and Jessi Glass moved to Chefoo. These were some scarce times – about the only food in supply were potatoes and many churches and places were having to close and soon Wiley and all foreigners were assigned to housing units. They soon held services and Wiley was unanimously voted Pastor. Eventually they were on their way back to America. Wiley held services on the ship home to a great response. In November 1943 Wiley and Jessi arrived in New York City. After Wiley turned seventy there were still many requests from missionaries on the field for him to return to help and preach to all the refugees in the communist overtaken worn torn country. Before he could return he began ministering to Chinese air cadets in training at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas. Many men were led to Christ. (p. 214). Unfortunately Wiley was not able to return to China because of the great Communist takeover and oppression. All foreigners were either made to leave or decided to on their own because of the problem it caused for Chinese Christians. \\"Sometimes family and others asked if [he] had not thrown [his] life away. Had all the labors in China gone down the drain? 'No', [Wiley] said, 'I am completely satisfied with having given my life to mission work in China. I just wish I had another to give. Although church and mission buildings have been appropriated by the government or destroyed, God remains. And hundreds of thousands of people continue in him and in serving others in his name. The fires that now burn to destroy the Christian religion in China are the crucible of purification that will produce a more virile Christian church – a church that will bless the world in the years ahead.\\" (p. 218) Throughout the next few years of their lives Wiley and Jessi went around teaching, preaching, and sharing about China and missions wherever they could. Memorial They eventually settled down in Fort Worth, Texas and it was Glass's great joy to teach Sunday school at the Gambrell Street Baptist Church there. Jessi died on October 14, 1962. Glass died on November 14, 1967. It was said that his rock-like convictions brought stability to all whom he influenced. Withal he was gentle and loving. He was a great preacher, and he could read and spoke the Chinese language so well that the Chinese respected and loved him and even the unlearned could understand him. His daughter wrote, \\"He stood on higher ground.\\" (p. 223) References * 1874 births 1967 deaths Baptist missionaries in China Baptist missionaries from the United States People from Franklin County, Texas 20th-century Baptists American expatriates in China Southern Baptists ","title":"Wiley B.

The park and market are located in the southern Mexico City borough of Xochimilco, about 23 km south of the historic center of the city. The park was designed by Mario Schjetnan. The park was inaugurated in 1993, on chinampas (artificial lake islands) which had been previously declared as part of a World Heritage site. However, the area's ecology was badly degraded, and the park was established in order to revitalize and preserve the ecosystem. Success has been mixed. While much of the wetlands have been recharged, pollution and illegal settlements in the area remain as threats. As the park needs to be self-sustaining economically, there are a number of ways that the park raises money. One of the best known of these is the Xochimilco or Cuemanco Plant Market, which rents stalls to ornamental plant producers/sellers near the main entrance of the park. Description of the park Canal with chinampas on both sides Cows grazing on chinampas in the park Boats called \\"trajineras\\" in a canal The park extends over in the borough of Xochimilco, 23 km south of the historic center of Mexico City, between the Calle de Miramontes and the headquarters of the Secretary of the Navy. This area of Xochimilco is known as Cuemanco, so the park and market are also sometimes referred to with this name. The population around the area is a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural settlements. No one is permitted to live in the park. It is the largest park in Mexico City after Chapultepec, and is considered to be one of the \\"lungs\\" of Mexico City. The park is divided by the Anillo Periférico, with the section north of the road smaller than the southern section. The park has agreements with the public schools and receives 150,000 school children each year. Much of the park's territory is dedicated to chinampas. Chinampas are artificial islands created on the shallow waters of the lakes starting in the pre-Hispanic period. These islands began as rafts made with tree branches and other materials, which were then loaded with soil and mud from the lake bottom and tied to ahuejote or other kinds of trees to anchor them. Over time, these rafts would sink and pile up on the shallow lake bottom, eventually becoming fixed islands. As these islands multiplied in number, they became separated by canals, which are necessary to keep a constant supply of water to the chinampa. The canals of the parks were created by this method. In the past, chinampas were primarily used for the growing of foodstuffs, but today, most of what is raised is ornamental plants. Much of the ecological system was restored over a five-year period, then the area opened as a park in 1993 in order to create tourism, hinder the urbanization of the area and preserve the local ecology. Most of the park's area is an aquatic environment of lakes, canals or chinampas with some forested areas, much of which are planted with ahuejotes, pines and eucalyptus. Most of these chinampas have been transformed into \\"agro-ecological\\" land, meaning it is an ecological preserve and farmland at the same time. This area extends from Cuemanco to Mixquic in the Tláhuac borough, all connected by a series of canals. These are what made Xochimilco a World Heritage Site. The aim of this area is to preserve an environment known to the Aztecs over 500 years ago. In addition to the chinampas, restoration efforts expanded a lake to 54 hectares and created two smaller artificial ones of about a hectare each. Facing these waterways is the Cuemanco embarcadero (docks) from which trajinera boats depart, near the best-preserved chinampas in Xochimilco. Trajineras are flat- bottomed barges similar to gondolas. These were used in the past to move merchandise around the vast lake and canal system of the Valley of Mexico. Today, most are used for tourism. Tourist trajineras have been somewhat modified from ancient ones with the addition of a roof for shade, tables and chairs for picnicking and a large brightly decorated arch, often with a woman's name over top. In October and November, for Day of the Dead, the Cuemanco embarcadero hosts a play about La Llorona, a spectre said to roam parts of Mexico at night looking for her children. The play is called Cihuacóatl, Leyenda de la Llorona. This version of the story is based on an old goddess of the area called Cihuacóatl, whose story is similar to the current folk tale. Spectators are taken from the embarcadero to the Tlilac Lake on trajineras along canals with light and sound effects. The play takes place on a chinampa in the lake. These boats, along with the associated plant market, are the best-known features of the park. The park is divided into four areas: recreational, the Xochilta Garden, the bird sanctuary, and the botanical garden. The park has a number of other attractions. There are two greenhouses, bicycle and jogging paths, the Cuemanco canal for rowing, a small zoo, an aviary managed by SEDESOL, an area with archeological artifacts, enclosures for deer and coyotes in rehabilitation, playgrounds, 35 fields and courts for sports and areas for picnicking with palapas. The park's information center has displays related to the flora and fauna of the area. Although the park is owned by the city, it is managed by a private civil association called the Patronato del Parque Ecológico de Xochimilco Asociación Civil, with the aim of making the park self-sustaining economically. There is an entrance fee of twenty pesos, and bicycles, ATVs and boats available to rent. The plant market is also part of this, as stalls are rented out to sellers. One of the park's functions is to provide shelter for wildlife. The most iconic species to Xochimilco is the axolotl, a salamander species considered to be an incarnation of a god by the Aztecs because of its ability to regrow certain body parts. This animal is highly endangered and is no longer found wild in the canals of Xochimilco. It is kept from extinction through the efforts of organizations such as Umbral Axochiatl, which works in conjunction with the Instituto de Biología de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM). These have facilities at the park. Other research facilities include a meteorology station and a laboratory to test the soil and water. Wading egret in the park More successful has been the preservation of areas to host bird species, both those that live in the area year-round and those who migrate here in the winter. Many are seen on the large lake, called Huetzalen. The waters contain reeds, another plant called chacatules, often used in crafts, aquatic birds, insects and fish. The area is very quiet, especially compared to the urban area which nearly surrounds it. Migratory birds can be seen in the area starting in October, but the best time to see them is between December and April. Registered birds include sparrows, grackles, storks, hummingbirds, eagles, herons, moorhens and egrets. There are 15 species of ducks both native and migratory. Another migratory bird seen in the winter is the great egret, which grows to up to a meter in height. Some rare birds that have been seen here include the common kestrel, the osprey and certain types of owl. The most commonly observed migratory species is the American white pelican, which was not seen in the area before the lake and canals were restored. However, this species has only been seen in numbers since the 2000s, with 500 reported as of 2009. These birds migrate here from Canada and the northern US. Another important species is the kingfisher, which was earlier thought to be extinct in the area, but has been seen again. One drawback of the park is its lack of mature shade trees, as they were planted when the park was founded in the 1990s. The park's ecology remains in danger from pollution associated with urban sprawl. The water is contaminated by sewage and household garbage, damaging flora, driving away wildlife and risking the health of surrounding residents. The Cuemanco Plant Market The Xochimilco Plant Market, also called the Cuemanco Market, sits on an extension of 13 hectares of park land near the main entrance on Canal Nacional, where it crosses the Anillo Períferico Oriente. This live plant market and warehouse is the largest of its type in Latin America. It is the main moneymaking operation of the ecological park, renting out 1,700 stalls to sellers of live plants and related items, much the same way as Mexican traditional markets. Most of the sellers are producers. However, only about 600 stalls are active selling points, the rest are empty or used for storage. The most important related products made and sold at the market are flowerpots and vases. As the growing of ornamental plants is a relatively new phenomenon for Xochimilco, so is the making of these wares. Many craftsmen taught themselves how to create them. Most are made from traditional ceramics, but some are made with other materials, including recycled ones. Most are made by the sellers themselves and painted in bright colors and/or decorated with pebbles, crystals and other items. In addition to the plant-vending areas, there is a cactus garden and areas with restaurants. The market has at least seven stands that serve beer without the necessary permits and have been accused of selling to underage students from the three universities and prepas near the area – UAM Xochimilco, ITESM-CCM and Colegio de Bachilleres#4. A number attract student patrons by playing popular music on large loudspeakers. These stands are particularly popular with students on Fridays. Although the installation of the market and other moneymaking operations have proven to be successful, this plant market did have financial and operating difficulties in 2001. The financial difficulties were associated with losses in the funds destined for improvements and repairs. One reason for this was that many of the stalls had not yet been rented. Another problem was ongoing disputes between plant sellers and the then manager of the market, which required intervention by borough authorities. This market is the largest in Xochimilco but there are several others in the borough also dedicated to plants. These include Madreselva in the Bosque de Nativitas, Mercado Xochimilco, the Palacio de la Flor and the historic market of the San Luis Tlaxialtemalco community. History Much of the area of the park has been chinampa land since the pre- Hispanic period. Xochimilco is one of few areas left in the Valley of Mexico that still has a significant number of chinampas. The area was declared a biological reserve by the Mexican government in 1984 and a World Heritage Site in 1987 by UNESCO. Until 1988, the park land had been privately owned. However, the area had been severely degraded with lakes and canals going dry and the salinity and pollution of the remaining water making farming nearly impossible. The pollution was primarily coming from the Buenaventura River, with carried with it dirty water from other rivers in the south of the city. By the 1980s, these chinampa farmers had been prohibited from growing any edible plants on their lands. The city and federal governments conceived and began to implement a plan to save Mexico City's remaining chinampas called the Xochimilco Ecological Rescue Plan (Plan de Rescate Ecológico de Xochimilco), the center of which was the establishment of the park. The goal the project is to restore the chinampa ecosystem here to what it was during the Aztec Empire and then preserve it that way. The area was recharged with treated water to reinvigorate and create much of the surface water that is there today. Native vegetation was brought in by biologists and botanists. To restore soils, much of the sanitary debris from the 1985 earthquake and soils dug from the building of the Metro was brought in. After five years of work, the park was opened to the public in 1993. Eight years after its establishment, it already had 240,000 trees and 500,000 other kinds of plants over 210 hectares. However, expropriation of the land was fought by the chinampa owners for years after it occurred. The most problematic time for the park was in 2001, eight years after its opening. Despite major investments and efforts into restoration, there were still very serious contamination problems and a number of ejido lands that had been appropriated in the 1980s were given back to owners by the courts. The setback caused a number of local organizations to denounce the project as a failure and demand that then Mexico City mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador investigate. Since then, the park has managed to survive and be self-sustaining. However, serious environmental problems continue to plague that park and the rest of chinampa lands in Xochimilco. Pollution of the waters in the lakes and canals continue to be serious, as sewage and household garbage finds its way into the water. However, the most pressing problem is invasions of chinampa land by illegal settlements. In 2004 and 2007, families who had been swindled into illegally buying lands in the park lost their homes as they were evicted. Many people living illegally on the land have organized to put political pressure on authorities to let them remain, with mixed success. The fact that there are still illegal settlements in the park, which is land designated as a World Heritage Site, has put the borough at odds with UNESCO. UNESCO wants all illegal settlements out in order to preserve the site's status, but borough officials claim this would not be feasible.

Thomas Watson, later known as Thomas Watson-Wentworth (17 June 1665 – 6 October 1723), of Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1701 and 1723. Origins He was the third son of Edward Watson, 2nd Baron Rockingham (1630-1689) by his wife Anne Wentworth, only daughter of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1593-1641) and heiress of her childless brother William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford (1626-1695) of Wentworth Woodhouse. His eldest brother was Lewis Watson, 1st Earl of Rockingham, 3rd Baron Rockingham (1655-1724), who in 1714 was created Earl of Rockingham. Early life He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1683. Marriage and children By licence dated 18 July 1689 he married Alice Proby, a daughter and heiressHe displays her arms as an inescutcheon of pretence of Sir Thomas Proby, 1st Baronet, by whom he had children including: *Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Marquess of Rockingham (13 November 1693 – 14 December 1750), KB, Privy Council of Ireland, a Whig politician who in 1725 rebuilt Wentworth Woodhouse as the palatial building surviving today. Wentworth inheritance Inscription on monument of William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford in York Minster recording his heir as Thomas Watson, with an obligation to adopt the surname \\"Wentworth\\" In 1695 Watson inherited the fortune of his maternal uncle William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford, including the vast estate of Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, with others in Northamptonshire and Ireland. This was in preference to the Earl's first cousin once-removed Thomas Wentworth (later created Earl of Strafford), who shared with him common ancestry in the male line, and it led to a fierce rivalry between the two men and their families. In accordance with the terms of the bequest,As is publicly recorded on the monument to William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford in York Minster Watson adopted the additional surname of Wentworth, becoming Thomas Watson-Wentworth. Career Watson-Wentworth was returned unopposed as Whig Member of Parliament for Bossiney at a by-election on 21 March 1701. He was only returned as a stop-gap and at the general election later that year he sought a seat elsewhere but in the end decided not to stand. At the 1702 general election, he stood at Higham Ferrers but was defeated. However his opponent died within a year and Watson-Wentworth was returned unopposed for Higham Ferrers at a by-election on 22 November 1703. He acquired the electoral interest at Higham Ferrers and was returned unopposed at the general elections of 1705, 1708 and 1710. He made little impression in his first parliaments, but being a church supporter moved progressively towards the Tories culminating in opposing the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell and being considered a worthy patriot. At the 1713 general election he was returned at Malton as well as Higham Ferrers and decided to sit for Malton. Now being considered whimsical or a Whig that voted with the Tories he supported the Whigs against the expulsion of Richard Steele and in other divisions. After the 1715 general election, when he and his son were elected in a contest at Malton, he was classified as a Whig, but voted against the government on almost every occasion. At the 1722 general election he was returned unopposed again for Higham Ferrers. Death and burial Watson-Wentworth died at Harrowden on 6 October 1723 and was buried in York Minster where his elaborate monument with standing marble effigy survives.

The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Hudson included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History After delivery in 1961, Point Hudson was assigned a homeport of Panama City, Florida, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 72Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Hudson was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 Point Hudson was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Naval Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and .

The 2nd Battalion was reformed as Company B, 81st Armor and was successful in liberating Luxembourg City on 10 September 1944. As December 1944 crept closer, the battalion entered the Huertgen Forest in the Alsace Region of France. The battalion then rested and refitted for the final push into Germany. The unit spearheaded the 5th Armored Division's drive to the Rhine River and became the first unit to cross the Siegfried Line into the Rhineland, crossing the Rhine in March 1945. It then drove to the Elbe, 45 miles from Berlin, and was engaged in mopping up German resistance in the Ninth Army sector. Upon returning from the battlefields of Europe, the battalion was deactivated in the fall of 1945. Except for seven months in 1950, it was active from 1948–1956 with the 5th Armored Division at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. In 1962, the 81st and the 94th Tank Battalions and the 505th Replacement Company were redesignated as the 81st Armor under the Combat Arms Regimental System. The 1st and 2nd Battalions were assigned to the 1st Armored Division in February of that year. The 2nd battalion was deactivated in 1971 and reactivated in 1972 in West Germany. It was then deactivated again in 1989. The 2nd Battalion was once again reactivated in January 1996 as a part of the 1st Armored Training Brigade at Fort Knox, Kentucky. http://www.knox.army.mil/school/194arbde/181/bnHistory.asp History and lineage of 3rd Battalion The \\"Royal Lions\\" have performed a number of varied and challenging missions over the decades. The battalion was constituted on 28 August 1941, as Company C, 81st Armor Regiment and activated at Fort Knox, Kentucky, on 1 October of that year. Following America's entry into the Second World War, on 20 September 1943, the battalion was re-designated as the 707th Tank Battalion, where it saw combat as part of both the 5th and 7th Armored Divisions. As part of the drive through Europe the 707th participated in the campaigns of Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, and Central Europe. The 707th was awarded the Luxembourg Croix de Guerre, World War II streamer, for its outstanding wartime service. Following its successful campaigns in Europe the 707th was inactivated at Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 October 1945. In the early months of the Korean War the battalion was re- designated as the 94th Medium Tank Battalion, 7th Armored Division and reactivated again on 24 November 1950, at Camp Roberts, California, where it remained until inactivated on 15 November 1953. On 3 February 1962, the battalion was relieved from assignment to the 7th Armored Division and re- designated as the 3d battalion, 81st Armored Regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. The battalion was reassigned to the 5th Armored Division. On 25 March 1987, the battalion was relieved from assignment to the 5th Armored Division and re-designated at Fort Knox, Kentucky as a training battalion. On 1 October 1991, the battalion was again deactivated. The current mission of the battalion begins with the creation, on 20 July 1965, of Committee Group. This unit was activated at Fort Knox with the mission of providing training support to Initial Entry Training soldiers. On 2 March 1986, Committee Group was re-designated as Training Group, the battalion was placed under the operational control of the 4th Training Brigade. On 30 July 1993, Training Group was re-designated 3d Battalion, 81st Armored Regiment and attached to the 1st Armor Training Brigade. On 15 September 1997, the battalion accepted the attachment of the 233d Transportation Company (FORSCOM) from the 19th Engineer Battalion. From 1 June 2004 through 30 April 2006 the battalion also had 3 Cavalry OSUT Troops attached: Golf, Hotel and India Troops from 6th Squadron, 15th Cavalry. On 2 June 2010, the battalion assumed command and control of Delta Company, Echo Company and the Ordnance Training Detachment thereby assuming the mission of advanced individual training for 91A and 91M and Marine Corps armor instructors. On 1 OCT 2014 the BN was re- missioned under the 199th INF BDE during the MCOE re-organization to serve as the Army's very first PROVOST BN. A CO departed to 316 CAV, OTD, E CO, and the Marines were moved to 1-81AR, and C CO became a part of 194th AR BDE. The new Battalion formed from THE MCOE Band, B CO 3-81 AR missioned to oversee the Maneuver Captain Career Course, P TRP 316 CAV with the IMSO mission, and HHC MCoE. In its many forms and under various designations, 3d Battalion, 81st Armored Regiment has a long and proud history of service to our Army in time of peace and war.

His best known films are the British films Jew Süss (1934) and The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936). Career Born in Berlin, Mendes began his career as an actor in Vienna and Berlin in Max Reinhardt's company. After directing his first two films in Berlin, he settled in the United States in the early 1920s and remained there until 1933, directing more than a dozen features, mostly frothy comedies, while under contract to Paramount. His films included the last silent film made in the USA, The Four Feathers (1929) and the murder mystery Payment Deferred (1933) starring British actor Charles Laughton. After Adolf Hitler came to power, Mendes, who was Jewish, travelled to Britain to work at Gaumont-British Pictures, directing films with Michael Balcon producing. Under that banner, he directed Jew Süss (1934) starring Conrad Veidt, who had also emigrated from Germany. Mendes' Jew Suss should not be confused with the later Nazi film of the same title released in 1940 which is a virulently antisemitic film. Mendes' 1934 film version of Feuchtwanger's novel received strong notices at the time, and was considered an important and early film in exposing the origins of the antisemitism of the new Nazi government; in particular, it was praised by Albert Einstein and the Jewish American leader, Rabbi Stephen Wise, though the film itself did not attract an audience in Depression-era America.Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939 (2012) by Thomas Doherty, p. 59 Mendes best-known film, The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936), based on the H.G. Wells short story was made for Alexander Korda's London Films, for which Wells co-wrote the adaptation. It features Roland Young and Ralph Richardson,. His last British film was Moonlight Sonata aka The Charmer and starred the piano legend Paderewski as himself; it contains rare performance footage of the legendary pianist, then in exile from his native Nazi-occupied Poland. After returning to Hollywood in the late 1930s, he directed five more studio films. Mendes co-directed the pro-British International Squadron (1941), starring Ronald Reagan; this was one of several films on the Eagle Squadron of American pilots who volunteered to fly in the Battle of Britain before the US entered the war. His last feature films were based on patriotic World War II themes with such stars as Rosalind Russell as a Navy reconnaissance pilot who must fly one more mission before getting married in Flight for Freedom (1943) and Edward G Robinson as a man who may or may not have married a spy in Tampico (1944). \\"A competent, dependable director,\\" commented film historian Larry Langman, \\"he never achieved the critical success in America that came to some of his compatriots.\\"Larry Langman, Destination Hollywood: The Influence of Europeans on American Filmmaking, p. 79 Personal life Mendes' first wife was the actress Eva May, daughter of Mia May and Joe May. From 1926 to 1928, Mendes was married to the British-born silent film actress Dorothy Mackaill who became a star in the early days of Hollywood. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1935, he married Countess Marguerite de Bosdari (better known as Babe Plunket-Greene), former wife of Count Anthony de Bosdari and of David Plunket Greene.The American Mercury, vol. 37, 1936, p. 80 Mendes retired from films in 1946 and returned to London, where he remained until his death in on 24 February 1974.

Excavations at Lothal (2400 BCE) have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about 1/16 of an inch—less than 2 millimeters.Whitelaw, page 14 Ian Whitelaw (2007) holds that 'The Mohenjo-Daro ruler is divided into units corresponding to 1.32 inches (33.5 mm) and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with amazing accuracy—to within 0.005 of an inch. Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.'Whitelaw, page 15 Shigeo Iwata (2008) further writes 'The minimum division of graduation found in the segment of an ivory-made linear measure excavated in Lothal was 1.79 mm (that corresponds to 1/940 of a fathom), while that of the fragment of a shell-made one from Mohenjo-daro was 6.72 mm (1/250 of a fathom), and that of bronze-made one from Harapa was 9.33 mm (1/180 of a fathom).'

The early centuries immediately before the common era saw the Buddhists and the Jains of India adapt the stepwells into their architecture. Both the wells and the form of ritual bathing reached other parts of the world with Buddhism. Rock-cut step wells in the subcontinent date from 200-400 CE. Subsequently, the wells at Dhank (550-625 CE) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850-950 CE) were constructed.Livingston & Beach, page xxiii  Centers of ancient learning in Pakistan  The Ancient University of Taxila in Pakistan.

Nova Scotia's Appeal Court ruled the legislation violated the guarantee of freedom of expression in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, by constraining communication in relation to legal activity (R. v. Skinner (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 203). The Alberta Court of Appeal disagreed, holding that infringement of freedom of expression was a justifiable limitation as no “clear and convincing” alternative was available for dealing with the nuisance of street prostitution (R. v. Jahelka (1987), 79 A.R. 44). The Manitoba Court of Appeal upheld section 195.1(1)(c) on the grounds that there was no prima facie case of freedom of expression (Reference Re Sections 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, [1987] 6 W.W.R. 289). When referred to the Supreme Court, it upheld the sections (Reference Re Sections 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123])Chief Justice Dickson for the majority (Madam Justice Wilson and Madam Justice L'Heureux‑Dubé dissenting), agreed that freedom of expression was restricted by what was now 213(1)(c) it did not infringe or deny the freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d) of the Charter. He also held that it did not infringe the right to be treated fairly when life, liberty and security are affected by governmental action, as guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter. The reference to the court also included the bawdy house provisions which were held to not infringe the guarantee of freedom of expression provided for by section 2(b) of the Charter. Finally the impugned infringement of the freedom of expression guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Charter was justifiable under section 1 of the Charter as being a reasonable limit on a protected right. The justification was set out in three stages: # The court must first characterize the objective of the law (a remedy for solicitation in public places and the eradication of social nuisance from the public display of the sale of sex). This was constructed as restricted to taking prostitution off the streets and out of public view. In this respect, Dickson disagreed with the opinion of another justice that the legislative objective addressed the broader questions of the exploitation, degradation and subordination of women. # The court must assess the proportionality of the legislation to the objectives; in particular any infringement of rights must be the minimum to achieve this. It was held the provisions were not unduly intrusive. # The court must determine if the effects of the law so infringe a protected right that it outweighs the objective. It was held that the curtailment of street solicitation was in keeping with the interests of society, for its nuisance‑related aspects.  Section 198  A part of section 198(1)(d) was challenged in 1991, namely that a previous conviction of keeping a disorderly house amounts to proof of the nature of the premises in subsequent proceedings. This was held to contravene sections 11(d) and 7 of the Charter (R. v. Janoff (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 454 (Que. C.A.)), and became inoperative. = 21st century =  Ontario constitutional challenge 2007  A legal challenge to three of Canada's many prostitution laws was filed in Ontario Superior Court in March 2007. In a decision handed down by Madam Justice Susan Himel in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on September 28, 2010, the prostitution laws were declared invalid. The decision was stayed and an appeal was heard in by the Ontario Court of Appeal in June, 2011. On March 26, 2012 the Appeal court came to a decision which upheld the lower court's ruling on bawdy houses, modified the ruling on living on the avails to make exploitation a criminal offence, but reversed the decision on soliciting, holding that the effect on communities justified the limitation. Two of the five judges dissented from the last ruling, stating that the law on solicitation was not justifiable.Canada v. Bedford Ontario Court of Appeal March 26 2012 The court continued a stay of effect of a further twelve months on the first provision, and thirty days on the second. The Government announced it would appeal this decision on April 25, and on October 25, 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear the appeal.SCC to hear prostitution law appeal. CTV News Oct 25 2012 The Supreme Court also agreed to hear a cross-appeal by sex-trade workers on the Court of Appeal for Ontario's decision to ban solicitation. The Supreme Court of Canada heard the case on June 13, 2013.Supreme Court of Canada: JUDGMENT TO BE RENDERED IN APPEAL.

August 4 2007 , but did not proceed due to a procedural motion by the Attorney General of Canada seeking dismissal on the grounds of lack of standing by the litigants.

They dismissed the appeal enabling the case to once again proceed in the court of first instance. Canada (Attorney General) v. Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence Society, 2012 SCC 45 Sept 21 2012 The Supreme Court made a number of observations regarding the issues involved: > \\"In this case, all three factors, applied purposively and flexibly, favour > granting public interest standing to the respondents. In fact, there is no > dispute that the first and second factors are met: the respondents’ action > raises serious justiciable issues and the respondents have an interest in > the outcome of the action and are fully engaged with the issues that they > seek to raise. Indeed, the constitutionality of the prostitution provisions > of the Criminal Code constitutes a serious justiciable issue and the > respondents, given their work, have a strong engagement with the issue... > This case constitutes public interest litigation: the respondents have > raised issues of public importance that transcend their immediate interests. > Their challenge is comprehensive, relating as it does to nearly the entire > legislative scheme. It provides an opportunity to assess through the > constitutional lens the overall effect of this scheme on those most directly > affected by it... It is obvious that the claim is being pursued with > thoroughness and skill... The impugned Criminal Code provisions, by > criminalizing many of the activities surrounding prostitution, adversely > affect a great number of women.

Granting standing will not only serve to > enhance the principle of legality with respect to serious issues of direct > concern to some of the most marginalized members of society, but it will > also promote the economical use of scarce judicial resources\\" In view of the subsequent decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, this application became moot.  Supreme Court decision 2013  In a decision dated 20 December 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the laws in question, ruling that a ban on solicitation and brothels violated prostitutes' rights to safety. They delayed the enforcement of their decision for one year—also applicable to the Ontario sections—to give the government a chance to write new laws. Following the announcement of the decision Valerie Scott, one of the applicants, stated in the media that, regardless of the decision, sex workers must be involved in the process of constructing the new legislation: \\"The thing here is politicians, though they may know us as clients, they do not understand how sex work works. They won't be able to write a half-decent law. It will fail. That's why you must bring sex workers to the table in a meaningful way.\\"  Government response to Supreme Court decision  In response, Peter MacKay the Minister of Justice introduced amending legislation, C-36House of Commons. C-36 An Act to amend the Criminal Code in response to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Attorney General of Canada v. Bedford and to make consequential amendments to other Acts the \\"Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act\\" (PCEPA) on June 4, 2014,Statement by the Minister of Justice Regarding Legislation in Response to the Supreme Court of Canada Ruling in Attorney General of Canada v. Bedford et al. June 4 2014 which received first reading. Debate on second reading began on June 11. It passed the third reading on October 6 and was approved by the Senate on November 4. On November 6, 2014, Bill C-36 received Royal Assent and officially became law.  Case law  = Section 197: Bawdy house definition = The wording of section 197 allows of some interpretation. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Cohen [1939] \\"Prior to 1907, a common bawdy house was defined by section 225 of the Code as “a house, room, set of rooms or place of any kind kept for purposes of prostitution,” but in that year, by 6-7 Edward VII, chapter 8, section 2, the section was repealed and a new one enacted in the same terms but with the addition at the end, of the words “or occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for such purposes.” That case reversed an Ontario Court of Appeal decision acquitting a woman convicted of offering sexual services on her own. The court pointed to the words one or more persons as clearly indicating that operating on one's own constituted a bawdy house. Supreme Court of Canada. The King v. Cohen, [1939] S.C.R. 212 Another requisite is that a place must be resorted to for prostitution on a habitual and regular basis (R. v. Patterson (1968), 67 D.L.R. (2d) 82 (S.C.C.)). A woman who used her own apartment, alone, but regularly was convicted (R. v. Worthington (1972), 22 C.R.N.S. 34 (Ont. C.A.)). Another relates to the alternative definition of \\"the practice of acts of indecency\\", since this leaves open the definition of indecency, which may not be universally understood or accepted. One definition of community standards comes from the Supreme Court decision in R. v. Tremblay, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 932. In considering nude dancing the majority held that the acts were not indecent since they did not fall below the community standard of tolerance, citing the circumstances surrounding the act, the degree of harm that could result from public exposure, and expert evidence. No complaints had been received; the acts were in a closed room between consenting adults without physical contact, while expert witnesses suggested this was voyeurism and exhibitionism that caused no harm. When Tremblay was used in Ontario to determine that lap dancing or table dancing was not indecent Toronto passed a by-law prohibiting close-contact dancing. However the Court of Appeal reversed the decision on the grounds that this constituted prostitution (R. v. Mara, 27 O.R. (3d) 643). Furthermore, the court ruled that Parliament intended to abolish prostitution as a form of violence against women, and thus the dancing exceeded public acceptability. The Supreme Court confirmed this in June 1997 holding that sexual contact constitutes prostitution and exceeds community standards. > This type of activity is harmful to society in many ways. It degrades and > dehumanizes women; it desensitizes sexuality and is incompatible with the > dignity and equality of each human being. Mr. Justice Sopinka, 26 June 1997 = Section 210: Bawdy house Bawdy house keeping = Participation alone is insufficient under 210 (1), without “some degree of control over the care and management of the premises” (R. v. Corbeil, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 83). = Section 212: Procuring = Subsection 3 provides a presumption of offence of living on the avails, if associated with a sex worker or premise. A reverse onus such as this contravenes the presumption of evidence under section 11(d) of the Charter and was challenged. The Supreme Court found this justifiable in Downey v. R.( [1992] 2 S.C.R. 10). The majority accepted that an accused might be convicted despite the existence of reasonable doubt, for instance, a person may share accommodation with someone without necessarily living on their earnings. The Court found this a reasonable limit on the presumption of innocence because the intent was to prevent exploitation by pimps and that there was no real danger of innocent persons being found guilty if they provided evidence to the contrary, thereby constituting reasonable doubt. It was felt that this provision protected sex workers from abuse. See also * Wendy Babcock  References   Bibliography  * Canadian Criminal Law Information. Prostitution and Soliciting.

Many groups and movements would have their roots in the RT, both in the United States and internationally, including the Socialist Equality Party and the world Spartacist and LaRouche movements and their various splinters. The Revolutionary Tendency first crystallized around opposition to the SWP's line regarding the Cuban Revolution. The leadership regarded the Cuban regime as a full blown workers' state deserving unqualified defense by the Party. The RT rejected this because of the revolution's \\"petty bourgeois\\" leadership, and the absence of a vanguard party prior to the overthrow of the authoritarian government of Fulgencio Batista on 1 January 1959. The RT also objected to the moves of the SWP toward leaving the International Committee of the Fourth International and joining the \\"Pabloite\\" International Secretariat of the Fourth International. They also saw a danger of Pabloism within the SWP as well, because of what they regarded as a downplaying of the counter-revolutionary role of Stalinism. All of these positions were spelled out in a document called \\"In Defense of a Revolutionary Perspective - A Statement of Basic Positions\\", drawn up be Tim Wohlforth and others and presented to the SWP national committee in March 1962.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 pp.864-865 The tendency was concentrated among members who had been in the left wing of the Young Socialist League who had rejected merger into the Young People's Socialist League when Max Shachtman, leader of the parent Independent Socialist League had merged with the YPSL's parent group, the Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation. This group had subsequently been recruited by the SWP and were instrumental in founding the SWPs new youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance in 1960.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 pp.847-848, 864 The initial membership of the tendency was quite small, about 35 in October 1961, with clusters in New York and Bay Area of about 15 each. Subsequently the tendency grew with cadres in Detroit, Philadelphia and New Haven, Connecticut. The RT initially controlled the National Committee of the YSA, but the SWP leadership was able to out them.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 pp.865-866 On November 1, 1963 the Political Committee adopted a resolution suspending James Robertson, Shane Mage, Larry Ireland, and Lynne Harper. Two months later the Committee voted 18-1 to expel these members entirely. Early the next year the first issue of Spartacist appeared dated \\"February–March 1964\\" and published by \\"the supporters of the Revolutionary Tendency expelled from the Socialist Workers Party\\". The paper announced that the group would continue publishing \\"pending our re-admission to the SWP and resumption of our proper role within it.\\" The expelled members appealed their expulsion to the Fourth International (FI). They sent a letter dated February 23, 1964 to Pierre Frank requesting the FI to express their opinion regarding their organizational rights. On April 17 Frank replied, enclosing a resolution of the FI condemning the Spartacists. The expelled group tried one last time to appeal its expulsion. In May 1965 Harry Turner requested that the USFI allow it to present its case to its World Congress scheduled for that June. They were again rebuffed, claiming that since the SWP was not an official section of the FI they had no jurisdiction in the matter.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 pp.917-918  Reorganized Minority Tendency  In 1962 the RT itself splintered. A section that called itself the Reorganized Minority Tendency, which included Wohlforth, Albert Philips, Fred Mazelis and Lyndon LaRouche, split off. This group was more vocal in its adherence to the International Committee, and to the line led by Gerry Healy and the British Socialist Labour League. They also rejected the RTs characterization of the SWP as centrist, which they regarded as \\"giving up the political battle before it has begun\\". They were adamant against splitting the SWP, and obeying internal party discipline. At the 1963 SWP convention the Party decided to join the United Secretariat of the Fourth International and remove Wohlforth, who was already taking instructions from Healy, from his position on the Political Committee. The RMT members were expelled in early 1964 after disagreeing with the position the Party took with regard to the actions of the Trotskyist party in Ceylon. The expelled members reorganized themselves as the American Committee for the Fourth International.Alexander, Robert International Trotskyism: a documented analysis of the world movement Durham, Duke University Press 1991 pp.923-924 References Defunct Trotskyist organizations in the United States Political party factions in the United States Socialist Workers Party (United States) ","title":"Revolutionary Tendency (SWP)"},{"id":"31212419","text":"Gilbert Stuart (1755–1828) was an American painter from Rhode Island.

Plot In 1728, Dick Lindsay is taken prisoner by Captain Barclay and incarcerated aboard the Black Panther, his pirate ship. Also on board against his will is Robert MacAllister, nephew of Barclay's nemesis, Andrew MacAllister. The pirate kidnapped Robert as retribution for MacAllister having long ago done likewise to Barclay's infant daughter, Christine. The feud has continued for more than 20 years. Now the pirate intends to settle it once and for all. He propositions Dick to impersonate Robert and return to his uncle, going so far as to duplicate a distinctive scar on Robert's face. Dick does as told, hoping to gain his freedom. He is a welcome sight to MacAllister, but others are not quite sure what to make of this newcomer, including Shively, a brutal overseer of the men, and particularly Christine, now a grown woman with a volatile disposition. Put in charge of the mill, Dick gains the trust of MacAllister's slaves, who are plotting a revolt. The real Robert's dead body washes up, however, so MacAllister now knows he is being deceived. Christine's growing love for Dick is a factor in not having him killed at first, but soon Shively and Dick are engaged in a knife fight to the death. Captain Barclay and his men await a signal to invade the island. When a stash of explosives is detonated, they storm the isle. MacAllister is killed by Barclay, who is savoring his revenge when Christine gains some of her own, mortally wounding Barclay. She remains unaware that she has just killed her own father, and with his dying words, Barclay implores Dick to keep it a secret.

It was one of the last pair of films made at Ealing Studios, which had been sold to the BBC, and one of the last Ealing movies under the nine-year relationship between Rank and Ealing. (Ealing would move to MGM studios, make several more movies, then be wound up.) It was an early star role for Belinda Lee. It was one of several \\"sensible girl\\" parts she played for Rank. Dorothy Alison was an Australian actor. Film rights were bought by Rank in early 1955. Filming began in late June 1955 at Pinewood Studios. There was location work at Guy's Hospital. \\"I'm not surprised that there is a change in title\\", said Russell. \\"After all, in England the 'lamp' is still pretty heavy for nurses.\\" Reception Variety called it \\"worthwhile, and as a piece of romantic entertainment, it is more than adequate.

From the year 803 AD, when the area was conquered by Charlemagne, it was the center of a diocese and subsequently became the center of a small sovereign state, a prince-bishopric (Hochstift) of Minden, until the time of the Peace of Westphalia (1648), when Minden was secularized as the Principality of Minden (which lasted until 1806). Today the church belongs to the diocese of Paderborn.  History  Over the course of many centuries, the cathedral grew from a simple Carolingian church to a monumental basilica. The High Gothic nave and its large tracery windows inspired a number of other buildings. During World War II, the church was almost completely destroyed by an aerial bombing conducted by US Army Air Force B17s on 28 March 1945. This almost completely destroyed the town center including the town hall and cathedral and resulted in the death of over 180 people. The church was rebuilt in the 1950s by architect Werner March. The church contains a number of valuable art treasures.

She received her first formal musical training from Simon Karas. For over half a century she collected, recorded, and performed traditional songs of Greece (demotika), around the world, appealing not only to the Greek diaspora, but also introducing non-Greek audiences to traditional Greek folk music and Turkish folk music. Biography Born in the poor district of Kaisariani, Athens in 1928 (one of many neighbourhoods established with the influx of Greek refugees from Turkey in 1922), Samiou was the daughter of Greek refugees from the village Bayındır near Smyrna in Asia Minor. Her mother fled to Greece in 1922, while her father, who was a prisoner of war, arrived slightly later during the exchange of populations. Career At the age of thirteen, whilst attending night school, Domna Samiou received her first formal musical training from Simon Karas at the Association for the Dissemination of National Music, where she was tutored in Byzantine and folk music, as well as being introduced to the idea of field research in music. Her first professional collaboration was with the National Radio Foundation (E.I.R.), the state-run national radio station of Greece at the time, when she was a member of the Simon Karas choir. In 1954 she became a full-time employee of the station, working in the National Music Section, in effect the folk music section of E.I.R. Through her work there, she came into contact with the leading traditional musicians of the day, who were part of a great wave of migration from the countryside to Athens. The National Music Section was busy recording them and, as a result, Domna became acquainted with all their various local musical styles. She was herself responsible for supervising records, stage plays and films. In 1963 Domna Samiou started touring the countryside independently, to record music for the archive she was establishing. Then, in 1971, she left her radio job entirely to focus on her own musical career, accepting an invitation by the composer and performer Dionyssis Savvopoulos to sing at a club called Rodeo, frequented by a youthful anti-junta audience. It marked the beginning of Domna Samiou's impact and influence on generations of young people in Greece. Soon after, she performed at the Bach Festival in London, run at the time by Lila Lalandi. It was a triumphant start to a brilliant musical career: “It made people overcome the embarrassment they felt for folk music”, as she herself stated later. In 1974, she started her collaboration with Columbia Records, which resulted in a number of LPs over the next years. In 1976-77, together with film directors Fotos Lambrinos and Andreas Thomopoulos, she toured the Greek countryside and produced twenty episodes of 'Musiko Odiporiko' ('Musical Travelogue') on Greek national television (ERT). In 1981, the Domna Samiou Greek Folk Music Association was founded to preserve and promote Greek traditional music and facilitate the production of records and musical events to the highest standards, free from the demands of commercial record companies. Death She died on 10 March 2012, following a short illness.84 years old Selected works =Musical editions= Published under the label of Domna Samiou Greek Folk Music Association. * Epic Songs of Warriors and Heroes (2017). * Folk Fables in Song (2008). * I Tread the Earth Gently (2008). * Songs of History and Heroes (2007). * The Great North Wind and Other Traditional Songs for Children (2007). * Of Nature and of Love (2006). * The Akolouthia Of Nymphios (2002). * Songs of Dame Sea (2002). * Domna Samiou at Megaron, The Athens Concert Hall (1999). * Easter Songs (1998). * Kaneloriza (1995). * Carnival Songs (1994). * Songs About Greeks Far From Home (1992, co-production with UNHCR). * Songs of Asia Minor (1991). =Archive material= Domna Samiou systematically recorded folk songs from every part of Greece.

The Spanish convoy was protected by fortified positions on shore, a castle and 600 Spanish and Irish footmen. Five out of six Spanish ships, commanded by General Pedro de Zubiaur were either sunk, captured or run aground in the battle, while the English fleet lost no ships.Graham p 243-44 Background On 23 September 1601 a Spanish Fleet under Don Juan del Águila arrived in Kinsale harbour. Zubiaur with six ships became separated from the main fleet. Eventually Zubiar arrived with a total force of 2000 men near Castlehaven on 1 December. At that time Castlehaven Castle was held by the O'Driscoll clan and they welcomed the Spanish. On 2 December, a day after the Spanish arrived in Castlehaven, Lord Mountjoy was informed that seven Spanish ships had entered the harbour of Castlehaven. On 4 December, Mountjoy received confirmation of the story. The danger posed by the Spaniards’ arrival was immediately realized, and Mountjoy took immediate steps to strengthen English defences. The commander of the English naval forces at Kinsale, Admiral Leveson, was ordered to \\"seeke the Spanish fleete at Castlehaven, to take them if he could, or otherwise to distresse them as much as he might.\\"Stafford p 399 Leveson then left his vice-admiral Preston to guard Kinsale harbour and took the rest of the fleet heavily armed to Castlehaven.McGurk pp 208-09 Battle Leveson had with him four naval vessels, Warspite, Defiance, Swiftsure, and Merlin, as well as a merchantman and a caravel. The following day, the wind was blowing inland, thereby preventing the English ships from leaving. Leveson had his vessels towed out of Kinsale harbour, and he then set off for Castlehaven.Ekin p 293-96 At 10 o’clock the next morning, 6 December, Leveson’s fleet arrived off Castlehaven. Zubiaur however was ready for them with an eight-gun battery at the mouth of the harbour. A Captain Fleming commanding the 10 gun Merlin rowed through Spanish fire to make a channel for the 518 ton Warspite to follow. A heavy pounding from the Spanish shore batteries and the vessels ensued which Leveson said ‘much annoyed’ him. From then until four o’clock that afternoon the two sides battled. Zubiaur's flagship galleon Maria Francesca was sunk with most hands. Another 200 ton vessel Cisno Camello was holed below the waterline and soon began to sink, and settled in shallow water. A French hire ship used for supplies was, according to Leveson reduced to matchwood. Two more Spanish vessels were pounded until their crews forced them onto the rocks after sustaining continuous fire particularly from the big galleons Defiance and Warspite. Finally a Spanish merchant was boarded and captured and was found to have wheat and biscuits before being abandoned and it too being driven aground. The Spanish were now being reinforced by more Irish foot men. Leveson's ships were running low on ammunition as they were continually returning fire. With all but one of the Spanish vessels neutralised, and with the wind blowing onshore, Leveson managed to withdraw his ships, being towed out under fire from the remaining shore batteries. Aftermath The fleet had suffered moderate damage; Most of the time Leveson had to tow his ships to Kinsale as the wind never seemed to be in his favour. After returning, Warpsite was found to have nearly 209 cannonballs struck according to the ship's surgeon William Farmer. Leveson had achieved a victory, neutralising Zubiaur’s naval potential. He would assist in Mountjoy's siege of Kinsale; he closed off the bay and blockaded it from the sea which was crucial to the English victory there. The Spanish garrison at Castlehaven was now cut off but distributed themselves around the area at Baltimore (Donneshed Castle), but these soon surrendered when news of the defeat at Kinsale came through. Pedro De Zubiaur made his way back to Spain and was arrested for his responsibilities but later released.Silke pg 174 References ;footnotes ;Citations Bibliography   ;External Links * http://www.odriscolls.me.uk/battle_of_castlehaven.htm Conflicts in 1601 1601 in Ireland Castlehaven 1601 Castlehaven 1601 Castlehaven 1601 Castelhaven Naval battles of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) 1601 in the British Empire ","title":"Battle of Castlehaven"},{"id":"31212925","text":"The Radio, Electrical and Television Retailers' Association is the main trade association for independent electronic (including television and audio) retailers in the United Kingdom.

Description Taylor's checkerspot is the darkest subspecies of the genus Euphydryas. It is a subspecies of Edith's checkerspot. This butterfly has a wingspan of less than . It gets its name from the checkered color pattern on its wings that consist of black, orange and white coloring. Taylor's checkerspot once ranged from the Willamette Valley in Oregon to Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Conservation status The Taylor's checkerspot butterfly is at extreme risk of going extinct. It was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2013.https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/10/03/2013-23552/endangered- and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-designation-of-critical-habitat-for-taylors In 2006, it was listed as state-endangered in Washington, where an active conservation program is underway. In Oregon Taylor's checkerspot is on the Threatened and Endangered Species list, but receives no protection under state statute. Before its dramatic decline Taylor's checkerspot was documented at more than seventy sites, but is currently found only at twelve sites in Washington and two in Oregon. It is currently listed as endangered in Canada, owing to the recent discovery of populations on Denman Island.http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ec/CW69-14-206-2011-eng.pdf Threats The biggest threat to its survival is the loss of prairie habitat due to contemporary settlement. Since the arrival of European Americans, more than 99% of the lowland prairies has been destroyed. The reason for this is that prairies are prime locations for agriculture as well as development of all types due to the lack of trees and flat topography. Along with habitat loss the subspecies is impacted by pesticide use that makes their plight even worse. Increased risk of harm due to drought is another major concern since they are now stuck on these patches of habitat with no chance to migrate to more suitable places.

(also known earlier as Eventide Clock Works Inc., or today simply Eventide) is an audio, broadcast and communications company in the United States whose audio division manufactures digital audio processors and DSP software, and guitar effects. Eventide was one of the first companies to manufacture digital audio processors, and its products are mainstays in sound recording and reproduction, post production, and broadcast studios.Sound On Sound, \\"Astral Tweaks: Eventide Eclipse Multi- effects,\\" Sep 2001, http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep01/articles/eclipse.asp Beginnings Eventide was founded by recording engineer Stephen Katz, inventor Richard Factor, and businessman/patent attorney Orville Greene. The business was founded in the basement of the Sound Exchange, a recording studio located at 265 West 54th Street in New York City and owned by Greene. When Katz needed to rewind the analog tape back to a specific point on their Ampex MM1000 multitrack recorder, but limited space in the studio did not allow for a tape op (a person who would operate the tape recorder on behalf of the sound engineer), Katz asked Factor to build a gadget that would do the job, and the resulting device turned into an Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) success for Ampex. Other early products included a two-second delay for telephone research and an electrostatic deflector for dispensing nanoliter quantities of chemical reagents. Eventide's original product line consisted of two products: the Instant Phaser (the result of an AES Show appearance), and what would become the 1745 Digital Delay Line (the result of a significant order from Maryland Public Broadcasting). Beginning with the 1745M, Eventide began widely using Random-access memory (RAM) chips in many of their products. After purchasing a Hewlett-Packard computer for researching reverb algorithms and needing to upgrade the memory in order for the computer to handle the necessary complex computations, Eventide designers realized that they could manufacture computer memory expansion far more affordably than the current market price. Therefore, Eventide began to manufacture and sell HP-compatible RAM expansion boards and did so from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. In 2017, Richard Factor was interviewed about Eventide's history on the Gear Club podcast in episodes 6 and 7. Aviation Shortly after Eventide moved its offices from Manhattan to New Jersey, its President earned a private airplane pilot's license. Surprised that moving map displays were not available for small airplanes, he had Eventide develop Argus, the first moving map system, and one of the first multi-function displays designed for general aviation use. Digital logging VR725 Communications Recorder In the early 1990s, Eventide developed digital logging machines that enabled broadcasters to begin archiving digitally with improved audio quality and far greater storage capabilities (via DAT and later DVD-RAM) than they previously had been working with. Eventide offers advanced Communications Logging Recorders and Instant Recall Recorders for P25, NG911, public safety, utilities, and air traffic control facilities. The NexLog mission-critical communications logging systems capture, store, protect, reproduce, and manage important interactions and critical data. H910 Harmonizer H910 Harmonizer The Eventide H910 Harmonizer was first demonstrated to universally positive reactions at the AES show in late 1974. It was designed by Eventide's first engineer, Tony Agnello (who went on to become the president of Eventide's audio division). The pre- production prototype was a hand-wired box topped with a music keyboard controller (which was developed into the HK 941). Jon Anderson of the band Yes was among those impressed and became a tester for the first prototype. The production H910 was released in 1975, offering pitch shifting (±1 octave), delay (up to 112.5 ms), feedback regeneration and other features in an easy- to-use box that sold for $1,600. The H910 model number refers to the Beatles song \\"One After 909\\". The first H910 customer was New York City's Channel 5, utilizing it to downward pitch shift I Love Lucy reruns that were sped up to create room to run more advertisements. Speeding up the reruns had increased the pitch of the audio, and the H910 was able to shift that pitch back to where it originally had been. Frank Zappa added it to his guitar processing rig. Producer Tony Visconti used the H910 to create the snare sound on David Bowie's album Low (1977), as did Tony Platt on AC/DC's song \\"Back in Black\\" (1980). Chuck Hammer in 1979 used it as an integral part of his Guitar Synth rig on tour with Lou Reed and in 1980 with David Bowie. Another popular application was to use two H910s slightly detuned with a small delay. Notable users of this twin Harmonizer effect included Eddie Van Halen, who used it for his trademark guitar sound, and Tom Lord-Alge, who used it for the vocals on the hit Steve Winwood song \\"Back in the High Life Again\\" (1986). Recognizing the popularity of this application, Eventide later recreated it as the \\"Dual 910\\" program in the H3000 UltraHarmonizer released in the late 1980s. The H910 Harmonizer was recognized by the AES with a TECnology Hall of Fame award in 2007.TECnology Hall of Fame, 1975 Eventide H910 Harmonizer, Sep 2007. Mix Online.

Fine motor skill (or dexterity) is the coordination of small muscles, in movements—usually involving the synchronisation of hands and fingers—with the eyes. The complex levels of manual dexterity that humans exhibit can be attributed to and demonstrated in tasks controlled by the nervous system. Fine motor skills aid in the growth of intelligence and develop continuously throughout the stages of human development. Types of motor skills Motor skills are movements and actions of the bone structures. Typically, they are categorised into two groups: gross motor skills and fine motor skills. Gross motor skills are involved in movement and coordination of the arms, legs, and other large body parts. They involve actions such as running, crawling and swimming. Fine motor skills are involved in smaller movements that occur in the wrists, hands, fingers, feet and toes. They involve smaller actions such as picking up objects between the thumb and finger, writing carefully, and even blinking. These two motor skills work together to provide coordination. Developmental stages Through each developmental stage of a child’s life and throughout our lifetime motor skills gradually develop. They are first seen during a child’s development stages: infancy, toddler-hood, preschool and school age. \\"Basic” fine motor skills gradually develop and are typically mastered between the ages of 6-12 in children. These skills will keep developing with age, practice and the increased use of muscles while playing sports, playing an instrument, using the computer, and writing. If deemed necessary, occupational therapy can help improve overall fine motor skills. =Infancy= The first motor skills, beginning from birth, are initially characterised by involuntary reflexes.Wells, Ken R. \\"Fine Motor Skills.\\" The Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health: Infancy through Adolescence.

These involuntary muscle movements are temporary and often disappear after the first two months. After eight weeks, the infant will begin to voluntarily use their fingers to touch. However, their ability to grab objects is still undeveloped at this point.Infant displaying the palmar grasp At two to five months the infant will begin to develop hand-eye coordination, and they will start reaching for and grasping objects. In this way, they improve their overall grasping skills. In 1952, Piaget found that even before infants are able to reach for and successfully grasp objects they see, they demonstrate competent hand-mouth coordination. A study was done by Philippe Rochat at Emory University in 1992, to test the relation between progress in the control of posture and the developmental transition from two handed to one handed engagement in reaching. It was found that the object reached for needed to be controlled. The precision of the reach is potentially maximized when placed centrally. It was also found that the posture needed to be controlled because infants that were not able to sit on their own used bimanual reaches in all postural positions except sitting upright, where they would reach one-handed. As a result, their grasping phases will not have been maximized because of the decrease in body control. On the other hand, if the infant does not have body control, it would be hard for them to get a hold of an object because their reach will be limited. As a result, the infant will just keep falling, stopping them from reaching an object because of no body control. When \\"nonsitting\\" infants reached bimanually, while seated upright, they often ended up falling forward which prevented them from reaching toward the target. Regardless of their ability or lack of ability to control self- sitting, infants are able to adjust their two handed engagement in relation to the arrangement of the objects being reached for. Analysis of hand-to-hand distance during reaching indicates that in the prone and supine posture, non- sitting infants moved their hands simultaneously towards the midline of their bodies as they reached which is not observed by stable sitting infants in any position. Non-sitter infants, although showing strong tendencies toward bimanual reaching, tend to reach with one hand only, when placed in the seated posture. Sitter infants show a majority of differentiated reaches in all posture conditions. A study conducted by Esther Thelen on postural control during infancy used the dynamic systems approach to observe motor development. The findings suggest that early reaching is constrained by head and shoulder instability. The relationship between posture and reaching cannot be disentangled. Thus, head control and body stability are necessary for the emergence of grasping. The next developmental milestone is between seven and twelve months, when a series of fine motor skills begins to develop. These include, but are not limited to, increase in grip, enhancement of vision, pointing with the index finger, smoothly transferring objects from one hand to the other, as well as using the pincer grip (with the thumb and index fingers) to pick up tiny objects with precision. A lot of factors change in grasping when the infant becomes seven months. The infant will have better chance of grasping due to the fact that the infant can sit up on their own. Therefore, the infant will not fall over. The infant grasping also changes. The infant starts to hold objects more properly when age increases =Toddler-hood= Writing abilities are a major fine motor skill. By the time a child is one year old, their fine motor skills have developed to allow the manipulation of objects with greater intent. As children manipulate objects with purpose, they gain experience identifying objects based on their shape, size, and weight. By engaging in hands-on play the child learns that some objects are heavy, requiring more force to move them; that some are small, easily slipping through the fingers; and that other objects come apart and can possibly be put back together again. This type of play is essential for the development of not only the child's fine motor skills, but also for learning how the world works. It is during this stage in the development of fine motor skills that a toddler will show hand dominance. =Preschool= Children typically attend preschool between the ages of 2 and 5. At this time, the child is capable of grasping objects using the static tripod grasp, which is the combined use of the index, thumb, and middle finger. A preschooler's motor skills are moderate, allowing the child to cut shapes out of paper, draw or trace over vertical lines with crayons, button their clothes, and pick up objects. A preferred hand dominates the majority of their activities. They also develop sensory awareness and interpret their environment by using their senses and coordinate movements based on that. After the static tripod grasp, the next form is the dynamic tripod grasp. These are shown in a series through Schneck and Henderson's Grip Form chart. Based on the accuracy and form of hold the child will be ranked either from 1-10 or 1-5 of how well they are able to complete the dynamic tripod grasp while properly writing. In conjunction with accuracy and precision the child will be able to properly position a writing utensil in terms of implement diameter as well as form and grip strength. Proper handwriting and drawing fall deeper into a category of graphomotor skills. The National Center of Teaching and Learning illustrates the abilities that preschoolers should have improved through their fine motor skills in several domains. Children use their motor skills by sorting and manipulating geometric shapes, making patterns, and using measurement tools to build their math skills. By using writing tools and reading books, they build their language and literacy. Arts and crafts activities like cutting and gluing paper, finger painting, and dressing up develops their creativity. Parents can support this development by intervening when the child does not perform the fine motor activity correctly, making use of several senses in a learning activity, and offer activities that the child will be successful with. Developmental disabilities may render a child incapable of performing certain motor activities, such as drawing or building blocks.Grissmer, David, et al. \\"Fine Motor Skills And Early Comprehension Of The World: Two New School Readiness Indicators.\\" Developmental Psychology 46.5 (2010): 1008-1017. PsycARTICLES. Fine motor skills acquired during this stage aids in the later advancement and understanding of subjects such as science and reading. A study by the American Journal of Occupational Therapy, which included twenty-six preschoolers who had received occupational therapy on a weekly basis, showed overall advancements in their fine motor skill area. The results showed a link between in-hand manipulation, eye-hand coordination, and grasping strength with the child's motor skills, self-care and social function. In addition, these children were shown to have better mobility and self-sustainment. =School age= During the ages between 5 and 7 the fine motor skills will have developed to a much higher degree, and are now being refined. As the child interacts with objects the movements of the elbows and shoulders should be less apparent, as should the movements of wrist and fingers. From the ages of 3–5 years old, girls advance their fine motor skills more than boys. Girls develop physically at an earlier age than boys; this is what allows them to advance their motor skills at a faster rate during prepubescent ages. Boys advance in gross motor skills later on at around age 5 and up. Girls are more advanced in balance and motor dexterity. Children should be able to make precise cuts with scissors, for example, cutting out squares and holding them in a more common and mature manner. The child's movements should become fluid as the arms and hands become more in sync with each other. The child should also be able to write more precisely on lines, and print letters and numbers with greater clarity. In terms of motor development and athletic performance, pediatric boys tend to be much more physically active than pediatric girls by nature and have a harder time staying still for long periods of time. This is due to the early development of motor skills that occurs in boys faster than it does in girls. During the first 2–3 years of elementary school, gross motor skills are similar among girls and boys with basic skills such as being able to run, jump, and toss a ball. However, boys start to develop more gross motor skills that give them an advantage in activities where girls may still be working on the basics. Boys' high energy and choice to be a part of large groups comes from their gross motor skills being developed. In general, pediatric girls tend to fall behind pediatric boys in terms of advancement of gross motor skills toward the end of elementary school. Common problems Fine motor skills can become impaired due to injury, illness, stroke, congenital deformities, cerebral palsy, or developmental disabilities. Problems with the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, muscles, or joints can also have an effect on fine motor skills, and can decrease control. If an infant or child up to age five is not developing their fine motor skills, they will show signs of difficulty controlling coordinated body movements with the hands, fingers, and face. In young children, the delay in the ability to sit up or learn to walk can be an early sign that there will be issues with fine motor skills. Children may also show signs of difficulty with tasks such as cutting with scissors, drawing lines, folding clothes, holding a pencil and writing, and zipping a zipper. These are tasks that involve fine motor skills, and if a child has difficulty with these they might have poor hand eye coordination and could need therapy to improve their skills. Assessment Fine motor skills can be assessed with standardized and non-standardized tests in children and adults. Fine-motor assessments can include force matching tasks. Humans exhibit a high degree of accuracy in force matching tasks where an individual is instructed to match a reference force applied to a finger with the same or different finger. Humans also exhibit a high degree of accuracy during grip force matching tasks. These aspects of manual dexterity are apparent in the ability of humans to effectively use tools, and perform challenging manipulation tasks such as handling unstable objects. Other assessments include but are not limited to PDMS \\"The Peabody Developmental Scales\\". PDMS is an evaluation done for children from birth till the age seven that examines the child's ability to grasp a variety of objects, the development of eye-hand coordination, and the child's overall finger dexterity. Similar to PDMS, Visual-motor integration assessment, VMI-R, is an assessment that examines the visual motor integration system which demonstrates and points out possible learning disabilities that are often related to delays in visual perception and fine-motor skills such as poor hand-eye coordination. Because additionally advancements in mathematics and language skills are directly corollated to the development of the fine motor system, it is essential that children acquire the fine motor skills that are needed to interact with the environment at an early stage.

It is a subspecies of Boisduval's blue (Icaricia icarioides). Description The Puget blue is a small blue and grey butterfly with a wingspan of around in the family Lycaenidae. The male has dorsal wings that are a silvery blue with a wide dark margin. The female is grey brown with diffuse blue patches at the base of the wings, with chocolate brown inner wings. The range of this subspecies spans from Vancouver Island and the Olympic Mountains in alpine to subalpine habitat to the lowland prairies of the South Puget Sound. Conservation status At this time, the Puget blue has not yet been designated endangered or threatened by the federal government, but it is a candidate subspecies for restoration in the state of Washington. Populations in the prairies have declined due to the loss of prairies as well as the encroachment of woody vegetation such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius). Threats Scotch broom out-competes the host plants of this butterfly subspecies and as a nitrogen fixer it alters the natural nutrient balance in the soils. Because many prairie species, such as their host plant, the lupine (Lupinus lepidus and Lupinus albicaulis), have adapted to thrive on much lower nutrient levels the increased nutrient loading greatly inhibits the lupines ability to thrive. The subalpine populations have increased as logging activities have cleared land allowing the expansion of the lupine. The biggest threat to the subalpine populations is climate change, while the prairie populations are most threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Land management techniques used to maintain prairies such as controlled burns, can either help or hurt populations of native butterflies. If timed correctly controlled burns can greatly increase that year's lupine crop, giving the Puget blue a better chance of success.

Sherabat Khan Wazir, a top commander of Hafiz Gul Bahadur's Taliban faction, was killed in the strike, and in response Bahadur threatened to end the peace deal struck with the Pakistani government almost four years earlier. The airstrike was part of a long series of drone attacks in Pakistan carried out by the CIA and United States military. It occurred just two days after diyya, a form of compensation paid to a victim's family under Islamic law, was paid for the release of U.S. CIA operative Raymond Allen Davis, signaling a resumption of U.S. activity after a several week hiatus while Davis' pardon on murder charges was being negotiated. Attack According to Pakistani intelligence officials, the attack targeted a compound where several dozen people believed to be Taliban militants linked to Hafiz Gul Bahadur were meeting. On 17 March 2011, two or three missiles were fired within three minutes, killing at least 44 people and injuring around fifteen others. A security official in Peshawar said that the building that was attacked was used as a training location and meeting place for militants. A car that was transporting additional suspected militants near the location of the primary target was also fired upon. Of those killed, a Pakistani security official said that eleven Taliban personnel were killed in the attack, while the remainder were civilians. According to a local tribesman, however, the suspected militants were actually a group of tribal elders from a nearby village who were having a business meeting. The meeting was said to be regarding the disputed sale of a chromite mine in the area. The tribesman said that a commander loyal to Bahadur, Sharabat Khan, was present, but only because he was also a tribal elder. Khan was reported to have been killed in the attack. After the attack the Taliban faction led by Hafiz Gul Bahadur threatened to cancel the peace deal with Pakistani government to protest the governments inability to halt drone attacks. Reaction General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan Army, issued a statement saying that the attack was \\"in complete violation of human rights\\" and that \\"such aggression against people of Pakistan is unjustified and intolerable under any circumstances.\\" Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the attack, saying that it would only strengthen the hands of militants. The governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Syed Masood Kausar, also strongly condemned the attack, saying that civilians and policemen were killed. Pakistan foreign secretary Salman Bashir asked the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, for an explanation and an apology. After the attack, Pakistan said it would not attend talks with the United States on 26 March 2011 in Brussels to discuss the future of Afghanistan. The foreign ministry of Pakistan stated that \\"[i]t is evident that the fundamentals of our relations need to be revisited… Pakistan should not be taken for granted nor treated as a client state.\\" The US embassy in Pakistan refused to comment, saying it was not aware that such talks had been proposed. The attack came shortly after CIA contractor Raymond Allen Davis, who had been arrested on charges of killing two people in January, was released, and protests against his release were expected to intensify after the drone strike. =Protests= Thousands of Pakistani protesters took to the street following the attack. The US Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar were closed due to security concerns. Thousands of protesters gathered in the capital Islamabad, chanting \\"[f]riends of the US are traitors\\", \\"[d]own with America\\" and \\"[h]ang Zardari.\\" In Miranshah more than a thousand locals collected and demanded compensation for the dead and an immediate stop to the drone attacks. =Military= After the attack, the Pakistani Air Force increased air patrols of the northwestern tribal areas in Pakistan. It also cancelled holidays and breaks for officials in the region.

Napier, known to her family as \\"Mollie\\", was married three times. Her first husband was the actor G.H. Mulcaster whom she married in 1927 and later divorced. Her second was the Austrian tenor, Richard Tauber (1891–1948), to whom she was married from 1936 until his death, and her third was the Polish artist, Stanislaw Wolkowicki (1902-1965), whom she had met during the war [when she worked for the Polish Red Cross] and married in 1953. He died in 1965, and she was buried with him in the Churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, Sunningdale, Berkshire in 1982. Napier was the daughter of Major APB Ellis, an ENT specialist and sometime army surgeon, and Alice Napier. She took her mother's maiden name as her screen name. Having spent much of her childhood in South Africa, where she attended the Maris Stella School in Durban, the family returned to England and she embarked on a stage career. After a few years in repertory, she was offered a screen test by Alexander Korda, and made a few films before he dropped her. She then appeared in 1935 opposite Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in Mimi, a film directed by Paul L. Stein, a childhood friend of Richard Tauber, who had directed Tauber's first British film Blossom Time in 1934. It was through Paul Stein she met Tauber, and appeared with him in three films made in 1935/36, the first of them, Heart's Desire, under Stein's direction. For five years, 1935 until 1940, she rented the Villa Capri at Elstree, where she lived with Tauber from the time of their marriage. In April 1940 she joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, and after basic training joined an Ambulance Unit in Scotland, where she cared for Polish Soldiers, eventually becoming an NCO in a Polish unit. She later joined the Polish Welfare Unit in London, early in 1945 she travelled to Holland with the Red Cross to care for Polish soldiers escaping from Germany, and after VE Day moved to Meppen in Germany, receiving a high commendation from General Clemens Rudnicki for her work on behalf of Polish Servicemen. [Details in her book 'My Heart and I', London, 1959, pages 155-177] Shortly before Tauber's death, she set up an artists studio in Beauchamp Place, which became the design and display company Diana Display Ltd.

Patients suffering from chronic angina (chest pain) are generally managed aggressively with medications to help alleviate their symptoms and frequently receive multiple coronary interventions and even bypass surgery over the course of the advancement of their disease. When chest pain continues in spite of treatments, the condition is considered, “refractory angina.” Coronary artery disease remains a leading cause of death for persons over the age of 65 in the United States. It is estimated that in the United States 100,000-200,000 symptomatic patients are diagnosed each year with refractory angina but are not candidates for further intervention or bypass surgery. A contemporary study indicates that as many of 3 out of 10 patients with CAD may have incomplete revascularization. In addition to the TMR procedure, Cardiogenesis is developing proprietary catheter-based systems for the delivery of biologics, such as stem cells, as an adjunctive therapy for this patient population.

Description The Mardon skipper is a small butterfly, less than one inch (25 mm), that belongs to the family Hesperiidae. Its habitat extends from the northwestern coast of Washington, through southern Oregon and northern California. In Washington, the Mardon skipper can be found in the Puget prairies and the South Cascades. Some distinguishing characteristics of this species are a hairy orange body with dark orange accents on the upper surface and a light orange lower surface with white-yellowish rectangular spots. Males are known to be darker than females and smaller. Other species with very similar attributes include the Sonora skipper (Polites sonora) and the woodland skipper (Ochlodes sylvanoides). This butterfly species, native to the northwest, is most commonly found on prairies populated by native grasses such as Roemer's fescue (Festuca roemeri) and red fescue (Festuca rubra). These native plants serve as oviposition sites. Some of the native plants that provide the species with nectar include the early blue violet (Viola adunca), prairie lupine (Lupinus lepidus), as well as Idaho blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchum idahoense), penstemon (Penstemon species) and vetch (Vicia species). Conservation status The Mardon skipper butterfly is currently listed as an endangered species in Washington state and classified as a federal endangered species. Its status denotes a high priority for conservation efforts. Over the years, studies have been assessing the decline of this species in the Puget prairies, by conducting population counts and habitat characteristics and their effect on the Mardon skipper's life cycle. Threats The Mardon skipper is a non-migratory species, so its response to changes in habitat is minimized, especially during the larval stage. This species is known to prefer open grasslands populated by native plants that can serve as host plants as well as nectar sources. Their optimal habitat can be easily degraded through conversion and fragmentation, increase in invasive species, as well as changes in weather and human actions.

SFTS has fatality rates ranging from 12% to as high as 30% in some areas. The major clinical symptoms of SFTS are fever, vomiting, diarrhea, multiple organ failure, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leucopenia (low white blood cell count), and elevated liver enzyme levels. Virology SFTS virus (SFTSV) is a virus in the order Bunyavirales. Person-to-person transmission was not noted in early reports but has since been documented. The life cycle of the SFTSV most likely involves arthropod vectors and animal hosts. Humans appear to be largely accidental hosts. SFTSV has been detected in Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks.

The statute determined the law of Poljica, which is, by its form, style, content and establishment of social-economic relations, is totally different from the rest of Croatian statutes, but it is remarkably similar to legal code of Kievan Rus', namely Russkaya pravda from the same period. It is written in short, picturesque sentences that include the norms of Poljica's society from the highest political authorities to the norms that include all Poljicians' interests. Besides the laws written in this statute, the Poljica Statute also contains various decisions and verdicts of authority that, in a few occasions, refer to individuals. The Poljica Statute was changed as the society of Poljica changed. Another important value of the Poljica Statute is its archaic form, from which one can study the people from Poljica at the time and the people of Croatia in general. Typical features of the Poljica Statute are guarantees of freedom but also acceptance of responsibility to protect Poljica. History and basic features The Poljica Statute is a document of priceless value. Besides learning matters of law, it is possible to study historical, economical, political and other social relations from that time. The Poljica Statute was the result of the wish of the people of Poljice for stronger independence from the Kingdom of Croatia and the Republic of Venice. For that time, the Poljica Statute shows a great level of legal professionalism and consciousness of society. The earliest script from the 13th century Poljica Statute is written in Cyrillic. The language of the monument is a mixture of the receding Čakavian dialect and increasingly mode widespread Štokavian dialect and, given that Glagolite clergymen contributed to the text, a considerable number of Church Slavonicisms is present. The Poljice Statute had some redactions. All redactions occurred at turning points when the Republic of Poljica needed to recognize a new ruler. In the time of the House of Šubić, Poljicians had no need for a statute because they had common interests and goals. The first redaction occurred in 1322 when 18 articles were written which referred to Charles I of Hungary, but he did not accept the statute. This was also confirmed by the charter of Queen Elisabeth of Poland in 1333 in which she mentioned the Poljica Statute. The second redaction in 1387 was approved by King Tvrtko I of Bosnia. Several variants were later made from this redaction. In 1444, a third redaction was made for the new ruler, the Republic of Venice. In 1485, a fourth redaction was made. This redaction had many changes and additions, and it was created in the time of the personal union between Hungary and Croatia. From all those redactions, it can be seen that new some laws were created, some were repeated, and some were scattered on various places. The law of Poljica was based on collective laws of Croatia and was influenced by church, feudal, Roman and capitalist law. In the Poljica Statute, a clear difference was made between public and individual rights. Public rights were manifested in relations between serfs and their masters and impossibility for citizens to be elected to the Table of Poljica (the government). Even those laws were made, they had no greater influence on citizens because citizens had their village autonomy inside of their districts, so they had, through their village princes, an influence on election of new princes, and there were almost no serfs. Laws for serfs were very strict, and for some violations commoners were more severely punished than nobles. For example, if a tenant cursed his landlord his tongue was cut out, and if he dared to rise a hand against him, his right arm would be chopped off.Dositey Obradovich Circle.

History and Funding The BindingDB project was conceived in the mid-1990s, based upon recognition of the broad value of quantitative affinity data and the inadequacy of journal articles as a means of making these data accessible. A NIST-sponsored workshop in September 1997 validated the concept, and funding from the NSF and NIST enabled initial development of the database with a collection of data for systems of many types, including protein-ligand, protein-protein, and host–guest binding. However, hopes that the database would be populated primarily through depositions by experimentalists were not borne out, and it became clear that the project would have to take responsibility for extracting data from the literature. Given the vastness of the molecular recognition literature and limitations in available resources, this meant that creating a useful database would require limiting attention to a well-defined set of high-value binding data. The decision was taken to focus on binding data for small molecules with proteins that are drug-targets, or potential drug- targets, and for which the three-dimensional structure is available in the PDB or can potentially be modeled to high accuracy based upon the structure of a similar protein. This choice would aid drug-discovery for the selected targets, as well as the development of both ligand-based and structure-based methods of computational ligand-design. This is the current focus of BindingDB, which is led by Michael Gilson, based at UC San Diego's Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and supported by a grant from the NIH. Capabilities BindingDB's web-interface provides a range of browsing, query and data download tools. These include browsing by the name of a protein Target or by journal citation, query by chemical similarity and substructure, and downloads by target or query result.

He received education at Kulja and Istanbul and was a Pan-Turkist. Education After attending University of Constantinople and learning medicine, Sabri returned to Sinkiang to become a pharmacist. Career Governor of Sinkiang Yang Zengxin jailed Masud Sabri for pan turkist activities and then deported him from the province. Masud supported the First East Turkestan Republic while based at Aqsu with Mahmud Sijan. After it was crushed by the 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) Masud fled to British India and then to Nanking, where he joined the Kuomintang Republic of China government. The Central Military Academy and Central University accepted some of his relatives as students in Nanking after he joined the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. In 1942, Masud Sabri was serving on the 36 seated State Council (Chinese National Political Council), the only other Muslim member was the Chinese Muslim General Ma Lin. Bai Chongxi, the Defence Minister of China and a Muslim, was considered for being appointed Governor of Sinkiang. The position was then given to Masud Sabri, who was pro Kuomintang and anti-Soviet. He replaced Zhang Zhizhong. Ehmetjan Qasim, the Communist Uyghur Ili leader, repeatedly demanded that Masud Sabri be sacked as governor.UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO RESEOLVE POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN SINKIANG; EXTENT OF SOVIET AID AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO REBEL GROUPS IN SINKIANG; BORDER INCIDENT AT PEITASHAN Masud Sabri was an opponent of the Soviet puppet Uyghur regime in Ili during the Ili Rebellion, opposing all efforts to negotiate with Ehmetjan Qasim along with others like Wang Tseng-shan, a Chinese Muslim, who was the KMT commissioner of Civil Affairs in the Sinkiang Coalition Government from 1946–47, and was associated with the CC Clique. Masud Sabri was also a CC Clique member, as was the Tatar Burhan Shahidi and the KMT-general and Han- Chinese Wu Zhongxin. He led the Sinkiang coalition government from 1948-1949 Masud Sabri formed a group of pan turkists with Muhammad Amin Bughra and Isa Yusuf Alptekin to join the Kuomintang Republic of China coalition government in Sinkiang, opposing the Uyghur Communist Ili regime in the Second East Turkestan Republic.There were 3 Effendis, (Üch Äpändi) (ئۈچ ئەپەندى) Aisa Alptekin, Memtimin Bughra (Muhammad Amin Bughra), and Masud Sabri. The Second East Turkestan Republic attacked them as Kuomintang \\"puppets\\". Ehmetjan Qasim's government in Ili attacked Isa Yusuf Alptekin, Muhammad Amin Bughra, and Masud Sabri as supporters of the Kuomintang and puppets of imperialism. Masud Sabri and fellow Pan-Turkic Jadidist and East Turkestan Independence activist Muhammad Amin Bughra rejected the Soviet imposition of the name \\"Uyghur people\\" upon the Turkic people of Sinkiang. They wanted instead the name \\"Turkic ethnicity\\" (Tujue zu in Chinese) to be applied to their people. Masud Sabri also viewed the Hui people as Muslim Han Chinese and separate from his own people. The names \\"Türk\\" or \\"Türki\\" in particular were demanded by Bughra as the real name for his people. He slammed Sheng Shicai for his designation of Turkic Muslims into different ethnicities which could sow disunion among Turkic Muslims. In January 1949, Burhan Shahidi succeeded Masud Sabri as the chairman of Sinkiang Provincial Government.Benson 1990: 155 In 1948 Sabri turned down the proposal of being appointed ambassador to Iran from China.

It was built and officially opened on 20 August 1896 to celebrate a thousand years of Hungarian settlement in the Pannonian plain. The Millennium project included seven monuments in total all over the Hungarian part of Austro-Hungary, with Gardoš Tower being the southernmost. They are all different and not all of them are towers. As part of Old Core of Zemun, and also located in the middle of the Zemun Fortress, tower is protected both as Spatial Cultural-Historical Unit of Great Importance, and as a Protected Monument of Culture. Though today usually considered by the Belgraders as part of the old Gardoš Fortress, on which remains it was built, the tower is some 5 centuries younger than the fortress.  History  During the archaeological surveys in 2012-2013, two excellently preserved Roman graves with numerous artifacts and intact skeletons were discovered. They are located near the base of the tower, between the eastern and southern tower of the original fortress, and were dated to the 2nd or the 3rd century AD. The skeletons were nicknamed \\"the oldest Zemunians\\". The Gardoš Tower was part of the massive construction effort which included buildings in Budapest as well as four millennium towers on four directions of the world. Being the southernmost city in then Hungary within the Austria-Hungary, the tower was built on the ruins of the medieval fortress on Gardoš hill, Taurunum, which barely survived today (only angular towers and parts of the defending wall). The tower was built as a combination of various styles, mostly Roman. The tower is tall and, being a natural lookout, it was used by Zemun's firemen for decades. Today, the tower is named after Janos Hunyadi, who actually died in the old fortress, 440 years before the tower was built.Kula Gardoš - Istorijat The tower was projected by the Hungarian architects. It was finished on 5 August 1896 and officially opened 15 days later. Soon after it was built, inhabitants of Zemun began to call it colloquially after Janos Hunyadi. The tower was severely damaged in 1914 during the Austrian-Serbian fighting in the World War I, but was renovated during the Interbellum. This gave birth to one of the Zemun's urban myths. The lagums, or underground loess corridors of Zemun, their length and branching, are sources of numerous urban myths. One is that some lagums, originating from a cellar below the vertical stairs at the bottom of the Gardoš Tower, actually go all the way below the Sava river, crossing to Belgrade and connecting Gardoš Fortress with the Belgrade Fortress across the river. The story originated after the Austrians actually hit the tower in 1914, bombing it from the Danube. The left staircase which led to the cellar, collapsed. burying the cellar. Local population believed this was done on purpose by the Austrians, to hide the underground corridors. After the war, a tunnel was dug from the present ground-floor gallery into the buried cellar, but it turned out there were no corridors out of it. Still, the myth survives. It was also renovated in 1962. By 2006, the tower was ruined. It lost all additional construction elements (doors, windows) and was cut from all communal networks (electricity, sewage, water). It became a gathering place for the local homeless people and drug addicts. The wife and husband gallerists Borka and Đorđe Čubrilo organized the initial cleaning and renovation of the tower. Several tons of garbage was taken out of the tower. The Čubrilos rented the space and began reconstruction, per directives of the Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments. Electricity was reintroduced and the floors and vertical staircases which leads to the scenic viewpoint were renovated. The right staircase is the original one, from 1896, which survived the 1914 bombing. The floors and walls were also renovated, while the canal was dug to conduct the atmospheric water from the cellar. The almost completely destroyed main entry door was also repaired, as were the terraces of the tower and the ironworks. They were all reconstructed after the original schematics from 1896, which are kept in the Belgrade City Museum. The tower is embellished with decorative lights. The original, 2012 lights were replaced with the new ones in December 2019 as part of the wider reconstruction project for the entire fortress. The Čubrilos adapted the tower into an art gallery. Each year they organize exhibitions dedicated to the tower's revitalization. Exhibitions include some 8,000 photos taken by Đorđe Čubrilo since 2006, recording every step of the renovation.  Architecture  The tower is tall. It is in diameter at the base, but due to its design and the thickness of the walls, the interior at the same level has a diameter of only . The tower gradually narrows on higher levels, so as the thickness of the outer walls, which is on the second floor and on the third. It is built from sandstone and especially made hollow bricks, designed to put as much weight to the structure of the object as possible. Originally, an eagle was placed at the top of the tower, while each podest (rest area) had two sculptures, a lion and a coat of arms. Of all these ornaments, only one lion survived.

They are best known for the single \\"Something so Real\\", which was used in a McEwan's Lager commercial in 1988. Formation Formed early in 1987 in Edinburgh, the band was originally a seven piece, composed of vocals, keyboards, bass guitar, lead guitar, drums, percussion and saxophone. Following a meeting with a potential manager, the band moved to a rehearsal/residential base in Barrhead which resulted in the need for both the singer and guitar player to be replaced. A radio-based promotion campaign to find suitable replacements was launched and after several weeks of auditions, Grant Macintosh was chosen as vocalist and Allan Harvey as Lead Guitarist. Thereafter followed weeks of Intensive rehearsal and song-writing, followed by a small UK tour to debut the band. \\"Something So Real\\" and the McEwan's \\"Chinheads\\" television advertisement In 1988, having been together for a relatively short time, a deal was secured with McEwan's Lager to record one of their original tracks for use on an upcoming television advert, \\"Chinheads\\". The award-winning advert, featuring a fictional and quirky \\"upside-down\\" rock/soul band, was directed by Steve Barron (director of Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\", A-Ha's \\"Take On Me\\", and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) and featured an edited version (70 seconds) of the track \\"Something So Real\\". Recorded by the band at London's Mayfair Mews recording studio, the track was produced by Scottish producer B.A.Robertson and engineered by Kevin Whyte. The advert, released in 1989, caused quite a stir with its unique visuals and extremely catchy soundtrack. McEwan's were inundated with requests for information regarding who the music was by and if it could be purchased. McEwans chose to release the advert nationally and included ITV and Sky in its coverage, including London for the first time ever. A massive poster campaign was launched nationally to further promote the advert, again including London. The 70 second version was later replaced by an edited and slightly sped-up 40 second version in 1990. By 1989, it was clear there was a huge demand for the track and the band, now a three-piece consisting of Grant (Vocals), Robin (Keyboards) and Gordon (Percussion), quickly sought to secure a deal with BMG Records. Chart Performance A single was subsequently released on 9 September 1989, peaking at No.61 in the UK Singles Chart. In Scotland, however, it reached No.1, outselling Black Box's \\"Ride On Time\\".

It grows from and feeds on insects. When standing still, it resembles a leaf on a branch. Etymology The specific name, marshalli, is in honor of British entomologist Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall, who collected the holotype.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Rhampholeon marshalli, p. 169). Identification Marshall's leaf chameleon is unmistakable. It is the only such tiny chameleon in its range (sympatric with Chamaeleo dilepis quilensis, the flap-necked chameleon to a degree). This is a tiny species of , females being slightly larger. Isolated populations have distinct size variations; for example, those found just to the north of Mutare appear to be larger than those just to the south (separated by deep valleys). It has a dorsoventrally flattened head and body with prominent ribs and apparent venation, giving it the appearance of a leaf. Its colour variations are from deep brown to yellowish green according to the camouflage required for the situation. Males are usually more brightly coloured. =Breeding= Males, being slightly smaller, having a distinct penial swelling at the base of the tail, and a greener throat with a row of defining white or yellow tubercle spots, are relatively easy to distinguish from females.Broadley DG, Blake DK (1971). \\"A review of Rhampholeon marshalli Boulenger with the description of a new subspecies from Mozambique\\". Arnoldia 10 (5): 1-5. =Sympatric species= Little habitat overlap occurs as that of C. dilepsis approaches the range of Marshall's leaf chameleon. C. dilepis is rare, found in low, probably transitory population densities at the altitudes inhabited by R. marshalli, preferring the sunnier grasslands and forest margins. =Related species= *Rhampholeon gorongosae (Broadley 1971), once considered a subspecies has been raised to species, is found in similar habitats on the Mount Gorongosa massif in adjacent Mozambique. It was discovered by the ornithologist Stuart Irwin. *Rhampholeon platyceps is found in similar habitats on the Mt Mulanje in adjacent Malawi. =Karyotopic taxonomy= Wright 1973 confirms the number and form of the chromosomes from specimens provided by Broadley put R. marshalli in the genus Rhampholeon with Rhampholeon spectrum, the type species for the genus having 36 pairs of chromosomes like the other members of this genus. Distribution This species is found largely in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe and the adjacent upland forest of Mozambique. Habitat The patches of relict montane forest found in the Nyanga, Bvumba, Himalaya and Chimanimani Mountains are the primary habitats. They can be found in the cool, damp interior of the forest, mostly in the undercanopy and on the forest margins. These forest patches are surrounded by vast expanses of montane grassland, but are often so far apart as to be isolated from one another, but forest along the numerous mountain streams may link these very limited habitats. Marked specimens surveyed over a long time appeared not to travel far at all, usually less than 15 m.Broadley DG, Blake DK (1973).[wrong year?] Natural history Rhampholeon marshalli seems to inhabit the subcanopy and leaf litter of the relict cloud forests. Major canopy trees include Syzygium and Ficus. These forest are rich in fern and liana species. Forest margins have prickly species of Ilex and Rubus briars. How far up the canopy these creatures ascend is not known, but they tend to be found in the leaf litter or low shrubs. The winters in these (evergreen) forests are sharp and very cool; a period of brumation seems likely to occur for these tiny lizards. They eat insects, though these forests seem to be fairly depleted now. =Reproduction= In the rains (November to March), Marshall's leaf chameleon lays a small clutch of embryonated eggs that hatch quickly. HumphreysHumphreys, Clive (1990). \\"Observations of Nest Excavation, Egg-laying and Incubation Period of Marshalls Dwarf Chameleon\\". Zimbabwe Sci. News 24 (1/3): 3-4. photographed a gravid female excavating a hole in the forest soil and laying a clutch. One egg was exhumed and found to contain a fully developed embryo. After 35 days, the eggs hatched and the tiny juveniles dispersed. Juveniles are relatively large at long. Conservation Like other small mountain chameleons, this species appears to have population spikes and collapses. Their ranges do not appear to be threatened and much of their habitat is safe in Zimbabwe in the Nyanga National Park (where introduced tree species of wattle and pine are being eradicated to allow natural forest to re-emerge), Stapleford Forest Reserve, Bunga National Park and Botanical Garden, the Chimanimani National Park, and the Chirinda Forest Reserve. However, the tiny relic cloud forest patches are under constant threat from excessive collection of firewood and clearance for coffee, tea and protea plantations. Also, the corridors that once connected populations have indubitably diminished.

He is known for his history paintings, portraits, allegories and genre scenes, including merry companies. He worked in Brussels as court painter and left Flanders after the Fall of Antwerp in 1584. He then worked in Frankfurt for the remainder of his career.Joos van Winghe at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In Germany he enjoyed the patronage of Holy Roman emperor Rudolf II and adopted a more clearly Mannerist style.Walter Melion, Michael Zell, Joanna Woodall, Ut pictura amor: The Reflexive Imagery of Love in Artistic Theory and Practice, 1500–1700, BRILL, 2017, p. 440 Life The principal source on the life of Joos van Winghe is the Flemish contemporary art historian and artist Karel van Mander. Modern art historians treat van Mander's biographies of artists with circumspection. Van Mander recounts that van Winghe was born in Brussels in 1544. There is no independent information which can confirm this birth date.Joos van Winghe at museum boymans van beuningen Delilas delivers Samson to the Philistines Van Mander states that van Winghe traveled to Italy to further his studies. In Rome he lived with a cardinal for four years.Joos van Winghe in: Karel van Mander, Schilderboeck, 1604, copy at the Digital library for Dutch literature Van Winghe spent time in Parma where he reportedly painted a fresco of the Last Supper in the refectory of the monastery of the Servites.Charles M. Rosenberg, The Court Cities of Northern Italy: Milan, Parma, Piacenza, Mantua, Ferrara, Bologna, Urbino, Pesaro, and Rimini, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 120 He worked in the workshop of the Italian Mannerist painter Jacopo Bertoja who also employed the Flemish painter Bartholomaeus Spranger. Bertoja took van Winghe and Spranger to paint in the rooms of the Villa Farnese that he had been commissioned to finish. He also worked in Rome and Parma for Bertoja.Véronique Bücken, \\"Deux flamands dans l’atelier de Jacopo Bertoja: Joos van Winghe et Bartholomaeus Spranger\\", in: Jadranka Bertini (red.), Lelio Orsi e la cultura del suo tempo. Atti del convegno internazionale di studi, Reggio Emilia – Novellara 1988, Bologna, 1990, pp. 49–56 A close friendship between Spranger and van Winghe must have developed during their time in Italy. A drawing by Spranger after a painting van Winghe, which has disappeared today, proves that the two artists remained in contact decades later, when Spranger had been court painter to Rudolph II in Prague for many years and van Winghe had settled in Frankfurt.Jörg Diefenbacher, Eine Pragansicht von Anton Mirou, entstanden in einem dichten Beziehungsgeflecht niederländischer Künstler in Frankenthal, Frankfurt und Prag in: Studia Rudolphina Bulletin, mo. 8, 2008 ARTEFACTUM On his return trip he passed by Paris. He spent time at Fontainebleau where he was exposed to the Mannerist style of the School of Fontainebleau.Karel G. Boon, Netherlandish drawings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Rijksmuseum (Netherlands), Government Publishing Office, 1978 His period of travel is situated between 1564 and 1568. Flemish painter Hendrick de Clerck may have been van Winghe's pupil during his stay in Italy.Lawrence Steigrad Fine Arts Presents Portraits and Other Recent Acquisitions, Lawrence Steigrad Fine Arts, 2007 Elegant company, playing with torchlight After his return to Brussels in 1568 he became court painter to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, then the governor-general of the Spanish Netherlands. He created a number of religious compositions during his stay in Brussels. He married with Catharina van der Borcht, who was a member of the van der Borcht family of painters. Their son Jeremias van Winghe later became a painter. He left his home country with his family in 1584 after the Fall of Antwerp and his position as court painter was taken up by Otto van Veen. The fact that he left Flanders after the recapturing of Antwerp indicates that he was a Protestant.David Freedberg, Iconoclasm and painting in the revolt of the Netherlands, 1566–1609, Garland, 1988 A painted allegory described by van Mander depicting a chained personification of Belgica, i.e. the Netherlands, supports the view that his emigration was politically motivated. He settled in Frankfurt, where he became a citizen (burgher) in 1588. In Frankfurt he was part of the large contingent of Flemish artists who had left their home country for religious reasons, such as Hans Vredeman de Vries, Marten van Valckenborch and his sons Frederik van Valckenborch and Lucas van Valckenborch, Joris Hoefnagel and Jacob Hoefnagel.Reginald Howard Wilenski, Flemish Painters, 1430–1830, Viking Press, 1960, p. 190 There were also a great number of Flemish printmakers in Frankfurt. Many of the artists were tied together through a network of family relationships established through intermarriage. The exiled artists regularly worked together on projects where each artist would contribute to a painting the portion in which they were specialised. For instance, a figure painter and still life painter would contribute respectively the figures and still life elements in a painting. The artists would also provide designs for the publications engraved by the Flemish printmakers established in Frankfurt. Van Winghe further maintained close relations with the group of Flemish artists in Frankenthal through Hendrik Gijsmans, with whom he was related by marriage, through his younger brother Maximilian van Winghe, who lived in Frankenthal and through his marriage to Catharina van der Borcht, which connected him with the painter family of van der Borcht. Van Winghe likely enjoyed the patronage of Holy Roman emperor Rudolf II thanks to his friend Spranger who was court painter. Spranger may have been instrumental in the purchase of van Winghe's painting Apelles paints Campaspe before Alexander for the imperial collection and a series of twelve apostles designed by him, which was dedicated to Archbishop Berka in Prague. Mary Magdalene or Saint Agatha He was the father of the painter Jeremias van Winghe who remained active in Frankfurt. He died in Frankfurt in 1603. Work =General= He is known for religious works, allegories, portraits and genre works, as well as the designs of prints. Van Mander mentions several pieces by his hand in Brussels, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. It is on the basis of these paintings described by van Mander and works signed by the artist and a monogrammed drawing in Brussels, that a small body of paintings and drawings has been attributed to Joos van Winghe. Van Winghe was strongly influenced by Mannerism from central Italy and Venetian painting. His work was also influenced by the School of Fontainebleau, works of which he is believed to have studied on his return from Italy. In the 1590s, van Winghe worked in Frankfurt within the sphere of influence of the artists working at the court of emperor Rudolph II, including the Flemish painter Bartholomeus Spranger, court painter of Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, with whom he had collaborated during his period of residence in Rome. =Merry companies= Nocturnal party and masquerade Van Winghe painted a number of merry company scenes showing carnivals and nocturnal merry-makings.André Chastel, The Crisis of the Renaissance, 1520–1600, Skira, 1968, p. 191 Examples are the Elegant company, playing with torchlight and the Tavern scene in the night recently on the art market that are attributed to him. They show interiors at night lit by torches. Musicians are performing music in both paintings. In the second painting men and women are engaged in card playing, drinking, smoking and kissing. That the venue is a brothel is clear from the surreptitious exchange of a purse of money between one of the men and an old woman. A painting hanging on the back wall shows the scene of the prodigal son eating pig swill. This shows that the painting is likely depicting a scene from the biblical story of the prodigal son during his time of high living. This was a common merry company subject in Netherlandish painting of which Jan Sanders van Hemessen painted one of the first expressions in 1536.Attributed to Joos van Winghe, Elegant company, playing with torchlight at Sotheby'sAttributed to Joos van Winghe, Tavern scene in the night at Lempertz An Allegory of Vanity Van Winghe created a few versions on the theme of a Nocturnal feast and masquerade, also referred to as The house of ill repute. The original version is likely the painting in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. There is a drawing by van Winghe in the Kupferstich- Kabinett, Dresden. Jan Sadeler made an engraving after the work which is very close to the Brussels painting. Finally there is an anonymous painting in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam which differs from the drawing and engraving but is clearly inspired by van Winghe's creation. The Brussels painting shows an elegantly dressed party of people in a magnificent room. At the back of the room are statues in niches. The central niche is larger and contains a large statue of a female nude. In front are men and women engaged in drinking, games and courtship. On the right at the back of the room an old woman holding a purse is leading a young woman by the hand. In the foreground a woman plays an organ and men wearing masks play on lutes and sing. On both sides of the larger niche are two plates with Latin texts from the second Book of Wisdom, which point to the need to enjoy life. The Sadeler engraving carries at the bottom a text from the book of Sirach which warns from the danger of wine, women and prostitutes. The scene depicted in the painting and engraving illustrate the vices that are condemned by Sirach.Konrad Renger, Joos van Winghes \\"Nachtbancket met een Mascarade\\" und verwandte Darstellungen in: Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen 14. Bd. (1972), pp. 161-193 =Allegories= The Mannerist painters had a preference for works with an allegorical meaning. Van Winghe was no exception to this and designed various allegorical works such as the Allegory of Vanity (Dorotheum, Vienna, 17 October 2017, lot 240) and the Fame hovering over the globe (Collection Lingenauber Monaco), which deal with fairly common allegorical themes.Joos van Winghe, Allegory of Vanity, at DorotheumJoos van Winghe, Fame hovering over the globe, at Collection Lingenauber Monaco Other allegorical works have a political meaning such as the allegory described by van Mander depicting a chained personification of Belgica, i.e. the Netherlands. He painted a few versions of the Apelles paints Campaspe before Alexander (two versions in the Kunsthistorisches Museum) of which one was painted on commission for emperor Rudolph II. The inspiration of the paintings was the story of Alexander who asks Apelles to paint his mistress Campaspe. When Alexander notes that Apelles has fallen in love with his model, Alexander decides to leave his mistress to the painter. This theme was regarded as an allegory of the relationship between ruler and artists at Rudolph's court where the ruler sacrificed his own passions in favour of art. Van Winghe used the erotic language typical for the art produced for the Rudolphine court. Van Winghe painted a self-portrait of himself as the painter whose arm is pierced by the arrow of Cupid. The Flemish painter Jacob Hoefnagel who worked at the Rudolphine court painted a miniature version of the story of Apelles and Campaspe, which was inspired by van Winghe's treatment of the subject.Jacob Hoefnagel, Apelles painting Campaspe in the presence of Alexander At Rafael Valls Limited Hanging, burning and clubbing of Indians by Spanish soldiers from the Narratio regionum ... =Printed work= In Frankfurt van Winghe seems to have been mainly active as a draughtsman and designer of prints. He worked with the large community of engravers from his home country who had settled there such as Jan and Raphael Sadeler, Crispijn de Passe and Theodor de Bry. Van Winghe designed the illustrations for the first Latin translation (made after the French edition of 1579) of Bartolomé de las Casas' Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias which described the cruel treatment of the indigenous population in America. The book was published in 1598 in Frankfurt by Theodor de Bry (who also engraved the prints) and Johann Saur under the title Narratio regionum Indicarum per Hispanos quosdam deuastatarum verissima.Narratio regionum Indicarum per Hispanos quosdam deuastatarum verissima at the Library of Congress He designed a series of 12 apostles and Christ for Archbishop Berka in Prague, which were engraved by the Flemish engraver Johan Bara.

Environmental Education Centre The Environmental Education Centre has educational programs for grade levels between 3 and 18. Scientific activity The park has collaborated with the Deutsches Primatenzentrum and the University of Göttingen (Germany) on the development of techniques that have allowed for study of the sexual cycle of the female African elephant via noninvasive methods (namely the use feces and urine samples). The park also collaborates in behavioral studies of the male African elephant via non-invasive methods to further understand the reason for high aggression shown by male elephants at certain times of the year. Known by the name “Musth,” the male elephant poses a serious danger to people and other animals. The park also collaborates with other zoos and partners with animal conservationists in the conservation of endangered species like tigers, lions, bobcats, rhinos, and more. The park is a member of IAZA (the Iberian Association of Zoos and Aquaria) and EAZA (the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria), which helps conserve, protect, and restore endangered species threatened by extinction.

ResilientCity.org employs the following working definition of resilient cities: :\\"A resilient city is a city that has developed the systems and capacities to be able to absorb future shocks and stresses over time so as to still maintain essentially the same function, structure, systems, and identity, while at the same time working to mitigate the present causes of future shocks and stresses.\\" This definition stems from the pioneering work on resilience of C.S. Holling. Ecological resilience is the capacity of a natural system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks.Walker, B., Holling, C.

The band is made up of vocalist and percussionist Tiffany Lamson, vocalist and guitarist Taylor Guarisco, and bassist and guitarist Josh LeBlanc. The band's origins date to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which displaced Lamson and Guarisco from their New Orleans apartment and school, leading them to return to Lafayette with little to do. The duo began playing music together, and they recruited the other members shortly before a last-minute performance at a local pub in 2008. The band came together as the result of the unplanned, improvised jam. The members of Givers have previously performed in zydeco, jazz and Cajun groups. Following a touring stint with the Dirty Projectors and their debut 2009 EP, the band recorded their debut album and signed to Glassnote Records. The band's debut studio album, In Light, was released in June 2011 to favorable critical reviews. History =Early years and formation (2005-09)= thumb Givers was formed in 2008 in Lafayette, Louisiana by Tiffany Lamson, Taylor Guarisco, Kirby Campbell, Josh LeBlanc, William Henderson, and Nick Stephan. The band members knew one another from high school in Lafayette, where \\"there's two or three clubs that everybody plays at and supports each other.\\" Guarisco had toured with a zydeco band, while the other future members dabbled in Cajun and jazz music. Lamson grew up with gospel music as her parents were pastors, and she sang in their church band. The band's earliest origins date to when Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005. Lamson had just started her freshman year at the University of New Orleans. Guarisco and Lamson were rooming together when the storm hit, leaving them with roughly 15 feet of water in their apartment. With school on hold and nowhere to live, the duo returned home and began making music together and performing at open mic nights. While Lafayette was \\"suitably anonymous\\" before the disaster, nearly 30,000 people moved to the city following the tragedy, resulting an \\"explosion in culture.\\" Givers came together in 2008, when Lamson and Guarisco recruited Kirby Campbell, Will Henderson and Josh LeBlanc for a two-hour slot at a Lafayette pub. Lamson and Guarisco had never sung prior to joining the band, and Josh LeBlanc was a jazz trumpeter before learning the bass. The unnamed band hopped on the last-minute slot after another local band dropped off the bill, and improvised the entire set. They were phoned by the pub and invited back, and they continued to perform improvised sets. \\"That was how some of those songs were created, that total free-form state where we just played and recorded and then excerpted and rearranged,\\" Guarisco later said. The band scoured their record libraries looking for interesting song titles they could narrow down for a band name; Guarisco picked a Lucky Dragons song called \\"Givers.\\" The band recorded their debut EP in Campbell's bedroom, and released it online for free in 2009. After the newly christened Givers performed at Baton Rouge's stalwart music hall Spanish Moon, booking agent Aaron Scruggs gave the band what would become one of the \\"major accidents that became very fruitful occurrences,\\" according to Guarisco. For their Baton Rouge show, Dirty Projectors had a rare opening slot, and Scruggs gave it to Givers, who had been performing only part-time since their 2008 formation. Dirty Projectors was one of Guarisco's favorite bands. Frontman Dave Longstreth subsequently invited the band along as support for an East Coast tour. =Mainstream success (2010-2014)= The band recorded their debut album in January 2010 at the \\"magical, swampy [and] historical\\" Dockside Studios in Maurice, Louisiana, which had previously hosted acts such as B.B. King, Derek Trucks, Mavis Staples and Dr. John. The group cooped up in guest rooms along the banks of the Vermilion Bayou in Maurice, and spent 20 days recording the album. In contrast to their debut EP, which was recorded in Campbell's bedroom and sporadically recorded with a list of limitations, they viewed Dockside as a virtual utopia in contrast. As they were completely separated from city life — \\"You can't hear cars, there's no light pollution,\\" said Guarisco — they never found themselves distracted, simply waking up to record until \\"[we] were dead tired\\" in the late night. Each song from the band's debut EP was re- recorded and revamped. Ra Ra Riot also discovered the band and booked the band for its 2010 tour. The band's performance at the 2010 Austin City Limits festival led to a record deal with Glassnote, who had executives in the audience. Label founder Daniel Glass had run a mile from his train to the venue to catch the performance, and was \\"mesmerized,\\" later explaining \\"It was a visceral moment for me. I don't fall in love a lot. The only time this happened to me was when I walked into a brasserie in Paris and I met Phoenix.\\" The band signed to Glassnote Records on February 1, 2011.\\"Glassnote Signs GIVERS\\". Glassnote Music blog. February 1, 2011. In 2011, Henderson was replaced by Nick Stephan, and the group released their first full-length album In Light on June 7.\\"GIVERS announce debut album, 'In Light'\\". Glassnote Music blog. April 21, 2011. On June 13, they performed \\"Up Up Up\\", the first single off the album, on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\\"Givers perform 'Up Up Up'\\". Late Night with Jimmy Fallon blog. June 14, 2011 In Light was immensely successful for the young group. Every song from In Light was licensed for usage in film and television, on programs such as Glee, and on video games such as FIFA 12. The band attracted the praise of veteran musician Neil Young, who referred to the band in his 2012 memoir Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie Dream: \\"It sounded like they were in a complete other zone from the rest of music. They blew my mind,\\" Young wrote. The band performed at several music festivals in 2012, including Coachella, Lollapalooza, and the New Orleans Jazz Fest. They also performed with New Orleans' Preservation Hall Jazz Band as part of their 50th Anniversary at Carnegie Hall in January 2012. =Recent years (2015–present)= Following three years of touring, the band took a brief break. The group suffered from an identity crisis; Guarisco admitted to \\"a few months of losing perspective on what we thought we were.\\" They regrouped to work on their second album, New Kingdom, which saw release in November 2015. It was crafted over eighteen months at various studios in New Orleans, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Guarisco interpreted the sophomore album as more experimental, lacking traditional pop structures found on early efforts. Marcy Donelson from AllMusic found the LP \\"ebullient\\" and \\"thoughtful,\\" while a reviewer for Rolling Stone (Australia) viewed it as \\"overstuffed\\", leaving the listener \\"aurally exhausted.\\"Review of New Kingdom , Rolling Stone (Australia) In 2018, Glassnote issued the band's latest release, the Movin' On extended play. Movin' On compiles songs the band recorded with producer Dave Cobb—best-known for his work with Sturgill Simpson and Chris Stapleton—at the famed RCA Studio A in Nashville. It was also co- produced by Eric Heigle, and partially tracked at his New Orleans studio space. Musical style and influences The sound of Givers has been described as a combination of world music and indie rock. The music of Givers suggest modern exponents of Afro-pop, and their music has been called \\"island pop\\". The group were influenced by Dirty Projectors, as well as the Talking Heads. The group has been compared to Vampire Weekend, Neon Indian and Local Natives. \\"What negates a good comparison and a bad comparison is not really the artist they mention, it's in the way that their face looks when they say it,\\" said Guarisco.

Life The fourth son of the Hon. Laurence Shirley and Anne, daughter of Sir Walter Clarges, bart., he was born at Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, on 23 September 1725. His father was youngest son of Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers; Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, was his elder brother, and Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, was his first cousin. In 1742 Walter matriculated at New College, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1746, and the same year became rector of Loughrea, County Galway. His family connection with the Countess of Huntingdon brought him into intimate touch with the revivalist movements of the time. He became friendly with the Wesleys and George Whitefield, and from about 1758 he was one of the most loyal friends they had within the Church of England, which he belonged to all his life. He was often absent from Loughrea, and he became familiar speaker at English and Irish revivalist meetings. Robert Southey remarks that his intentions in his advocacy of Wesley were better than his judgment, since he belonged to the most dogmatic section of the movement. His work as a revivalist preacher brought him repeatedly into conflict with his bishop and fellow clergy. The bishop of Clonfert censured him in June 1778 and advised him to drop his Methodism, while some clergymen petitioned the archbishop to reprimand him for preaching in Plunkett Street Chapel, Dublin. In the Methodist controversy on justification by faith provoked by John Wesley's Arminianism and the proceedings at the conference of 1770, Shirley took an active part on the Calvinist side with his cousin, the Countess of Huntingdon, as whose chaplain he acted for a time, and Augustus Toplady. A circular issued by him inviting the clergy and laity to oppose Wesley drew from John William Fletcher of Madeley his ‘Checks to Antinomianism,’ and Shirley's influence embittered the dispute. William Romaine, Henry Venn, and John Berridge were among his close associates. His portrait hung in the library of Cheshunt College, in the foundation of which he took an interest. In his later years he suffered from dropsy, and of this he died on 7 April 1786; he was buried in St. Mary's Church, Dublin. Works His published works are: *‘Gospel Repentance,’ 1760, Dublin. * ‘Twelve Sermons,’ with an ‘Ode on the Judgment Day,’ 1761, Dublin; reprinted with additional odes to ‘Truth’ and ‘Liberty,’ 1764, London. B His best known works are hymns. In 1774 he assisted the Countess of Huntingdon in revising the hymns used in her chapels, and the collection included some of his own work. He is author of the missionary hymn, ‘Go, destined vessel, heavenly freighted, go!’ written on the departure of some missionaries for America in 1772; of ‘Flow fast, my tears, the cause is great;’ ‘Source of light and power divine,’ and others. Family He married, on 27 August 1766, Henrietta Maria, eldest daughter of John Phillips of Dublin, and by her had two sons and three daughters. His elder son, Walter, was father of Walter Augustus Shirley.

The twenty-seven year old unnamed narrator has escaped from a Nazi concentration camp. Along the way to Marseilles, he meets one of his friends, Paul. Paul then asks the narrator to deliver a letter to a writer named Weidel in Paris. When the narrator goes to deliver the letter, he finds out that Weidel has committed suicide. The narrator also finds that Weidel left behind a suitcase full of letters and an unfinished manuscript for a novel. Arriving in Marseilles, the narrator describes the chaos of a town full of people desperate to escape the Nazis. Most of his time is spent in cafes seeing the same people, with ever limited amounts of food and alcohol on sale. A mystery woman who haunts the cafes is Weidel's estranged wife, desperate for his help to leave France. She doesn't know Weidel is dead. The narrator is in love with her and tries to arrange matters so she can leave with him, without her knowing that he has assumed Weidel's identity (and Mexican visa).

These performance changes are assumed to be caused by either introduction of a small foreign object into the cavity or a small deformation of its boundary. Introduction When a resonant cavity is perturbed, e.g. by introducing a foreign object with distinct material properties into the cavity or when the shape of the cavity is changed slightly, electromagnetic fields inside the cavity change accordingly. This means that all the resonant modes (i.e. the quasinormal mode) of the unperturbed cavity slightly change. Analytically predicting how the perturbation changes the optical response is a classical problem in electromagnetics, with important implications spanning from the radio-frequency domain to present-day nano-optics. The underlying assumption of cavity perturbation theory is that electromagnetic fields inside the cavity after the change differ by a very small amount from the fields before the change. Then Maxwell's equations for original and perturbed cavities can be used to derive analytical expressions for the resulting resonant frequency shift and linewidth change (or Q factor change) by referring only to the original unperturbed mode (not the perturbed one). General theory It is convenient to denote cavity frequencies with a complex number tildeomega=omega-igamma/2, where omega=Re(tildeomega) is the angular resonant frequency and gamma=2Im(tildeomega) is the inverse of the mode lifetime. Cavity perturbation theory has been initially proposed by Bethe- Schwinger in optics , and Waldron in the radio frequency domain. These initial approaches rely on formulae that consider stored energy where tildeomega and tildeomega_0 are the complex frequencies of the perturbed and unperturbed cavity modes, and H_0 and E_0 are the electromagnetic fields of the unperturbed mode (permeability change is not considered for simplicity). Expression () relies on stored energy considerations. The latter are intuitive since common sense dictates that the maximum change in resonant frequency occurs when the perturbation is placed at the intensity maximum of the cavity mode. However energy consideration in electromagnetism is only valid for Hermitian systems for which energy is conserved. For cavities, energy is conserved only in the limit of very small leakage (infinite Q’s), so that Expression () is only valid in this limit. For instance, it is apparent that Expression () predicts a change of the Q factor (Im(tildeomega-tildeomega_0)) only if Deltaepsilon is complex, i.e. only if the perturber is absorbent. Clearly this is not the case and it is well known that a dielectric perturbation may either increase or decrease the Q factor. The problems stems from the fact that a cavity is an open non- Hermitian system with leakage and absorption. The theory of non-Hermitian electromagnetic systems abandons energy, i.e. E.E products, and rather focuses on E.E products that are complex quantities, the imaginary part being related to the leakage. To emphasize the difference between the normal modes of Hermitian systems and the resonance modes of leaky systems, the resonance modes are often referred to as quasinormal mode. In this framework, the frequency shift and the Q change are predicted by The accuracy of the seminal equation has been verified in a variety of complicated geometries. For low-Q cavities, such as plasmonic nanoresonators that are used for sensing, equation has been shown to predict both the shift and the broadening of the resonance with a high accuracy, whereas equation is inaccurately predicting both. For high-Q photonic cavities, such as photonic crystal cavities or microrings, experiments have evidenced that equation accurately predicts both the shift and the Q change, whereas equation only predicts the shift. The following is written with E.E products, but would better be understood with E.E products of quasinormal mode theory. Material perturbation Cavity material perturbation When a material within a cavity is changed (permittivity and/or permeability), a corresponding change in resonant frequency can be approximated as:David Pozar, Microwave Engineering, 2nd edition, Wiley, New York, NY, 1998. where omega is the angular resonant frequency of the perturbed cavity, omega_0 is the resonant frequency of the original cavity, E_0 and H_0 represent original electric and magnetic field respectively, mu and epsilon are original permeability and permittivity respectively, while Deltamu and Deltaepsilon are changes in original permeability and permittivity introduced by material change. Expression () can be rewritten in terms of stored energies as:Mathew, K. T. 2005. Perturbation Theory. Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering where W is the total energy stored in the original cavity and bar{w_e} and bar{w_m} are electric and magnetic energy densities respectively. Shape perturbation Cavity shape perturbation When a general shape of a resonant cavity is changed, a corresponding change in resonant frequency can be approximated as: Expression () for change in resonant frequency can additionally be written in terms of time-average stored energies as: where Delta W_m and Delta W_e represent time-average electric and magnetic energies contained in Delta V. This expression can also be written in terms of energy densities as: Considerable accuracy improvements of the predictive force of Equation () can be gained by incorporating local field corrections, which simply results from the interface conditions for electromagnetic fields that are different for the displacement- field and electric-field vectors at the shape boundaries. Applications Microwave measurement techniques based on cavity perturbation theory are generally used to determine the dielectric and magnetic parameters of materials and various circuit components such as dielectric resonators. Since ex-ante knowledge of the resonant frequency, resonant frequency shift and electromagnetic fields is necessary in order to extrapolate material properties, these measurement techniques generally make use of standard resonant cavities where resonant frequencies and electromagnetic fields are well known. Two examples of such standard resonant cavities are rectangular and circular waveguide cavities and coaxial cables resonators . Cavity perturbation measurement techniques for material characterization are used in many fields ranging from physics and material science to medicine and biology.Wenquan Che; Zhanxian Wang; Yumei Chang; Russer, P.; \\"Permittivity Measurement of Biological Materials with Improved Microwave Cavity Perturbation Technique,\\" Microwave Conference, 2008.

For rectangular waveguide cavity, field distribution of dominant TE_{10n} mode is well known. Ideally, the material to be measured is introduced into the cavity at the position of maximum electric or magnetic field. When the material is introduced at the position of maximum electric field, then the contribution of magnetic field to perturbed frequency shift is very small and can be ignored. In this case, we can use perturbation theory to derive expressions for real and imaginary components of complex material permittivity epsilon_r = epsilon_r'+jepsilon_r as: where f_c and f_s represent resonant frequencies of original cavity and perturbed cavity respectively, V_c and V_s represent volumes of original cavity and material sample respectively, Q_c and Q_s represent quality factors of original and perturbed cavities respectively. Once the complex permittivity of the material is known, we can easily calculate its effective conductivity sigma_e and dielectric loss tangent tandelta as: where f is the frequency of interest and epsilon_0 is the free space permittivity. Similarly, if the material is introduced into the cavity at the position of maximum magnetic field, then the contribution of electric field to perturbed frequency shift is very small and can be ignored. In this case, we can use perturbation theory to derive expressions for complex material permeability mu_r = mu_r'+jmu_r as: where lambda_g is the guide wavelength (calculated as lambda_g=frac{2l}{n}).

Initially activated on 1 July 1916, the 78th Field Artillery Battalion did not see action in World War I, but would later be reactivated at the start of World War II and participate in the campaigns for Algeria-French Morocco, Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, Ardennes-Alsace, Central Europe, and the Rhineland with the 2d Armored Division. The 78th Artillery Battalion's six batteries were reorganized into separate battalions in 1957, with the 1st Battalion, 78th Field Artillery being the only remaining active unit of the 78th Field Artillery. The 1st Battalion, 78th Field Artillery is assigned to the 428th Field Artillery Brigade, supporting the Fires Center of Excellence mission through the conduct of Initial Entry Training in order to provide the Army with combat ready Field Artillery Soldiers. The 1st Battalion, 78th Field Artillery conducts Advanced Individual Training for the 13-series (Field Artillery) Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) of 13B (Cannon Crewmember), 13F (Joint Fire Support Specialist), 13J (Field Artillery Automated Tactical Data System Specialist), 13M (Multiple Launch Rocket System Crewmember), and 13R (Firefinder Radar Operator). History =Africa= On 8 November 1942, the 78th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, part of the 2d Armored Division, approached the coast of French Morocco. At dusk the 78th landed at Safi and began to move inland. The batteries of the 78th were all equipped with T-19's and 105mm howitzers mounted on half-tracks. On 9 November, the 78th received word that a sizeable French force was marching from Marrakech to Safi. The landing team was ordered to intercept this force. That afternoon Battery C, 78th FA occupied a position to support a tank attack against the French and began to \\"rain steel\\" upon the enemy. The French, determined not to be pushed over, soon began firing on the 78th's position using World War 1 equipment. The antiquated French equipment did not present a legitimate threat, prompting General Harmon to disengage and march to his main objective -Casablanca. At dawn on 11 November, the armored column moved to the outskirts of Mazagan. Battery C, 78th FA and Battery B, 14th FA prepared to support an attack on the town soon after dawn. However, just before the attack, the French agreed to an armistice ending the \\"Battle of Mazagan\\". At Fedahla, due to heavy surf and equipment losses, the landing team which included Battery A, 78th FA, commanded by Captain George Bain, did not land until late in the evening on 9 November. On 10 November, the landing team started an envelopment that was soon called off upon receiving word of the armistice. At Port Lyautey only seven American tanks were on land when the French launched an attack with thirty-two Renault tanks in an effort to overrun the American beachhead. Captain C.W. Walter, commander Battery B, 78th FA, and Lieutenant Richard Moses, the forward observer, had landed with the seven American tanks. The two officers suddenly found themselves involved in serious action. The remainder of the landing team landed the next day. The team moved into position and kept the French at bay until the armistice. =Sicily= On 8 July 1943, the 78th sailed from the Bay of Tunis to Sicily as part of Task Force Kool. The invasion fleet had been subjected to continuous raids from the German Air Force. The 78th was directed to reinforce the artillery supporting the 18th Infantry and occupy positions 500 yards inland from the beach. The battalion maintained the same position on 9 July when it was ordered to support 1st Division units on the east flank. On 13 July, the 78th was ordered to support the 1st and 31-d Ranger Battalions in their attack on the small mountain town of Butera. The Rangers attacked at night on 13 July and, supported by artillery from the 78th, captured the town by early morning. The next day, the battalion displaced to new positions to support the consolidation of gains made by the Rangers. In the afternoon word came that the Germans had launched a serious counterattack against elements of the 1st Division about six miles to the north and effective antitank measures were needed. General Gaffey ordered the 78th to engage the German tanks by direct fire. However, the 1st Division had already repulsed the German counterattack. On 18 July, the 78th was ordered to reinforce the 14th FA, which was supporting Combat Command A in its mission to capture Palermo. However, upon reaching Palermo, there was no need to employ large armored units, and the 78th was no longer needed in Sicily. =Normandy= On 11 July 1944, the 78th Armored Field Artillery Battalion landed on the beaches of Normandy. The 78th was placed under the command of Combat Command B, Brigadier General I.D. White. The next several weeks were devoted to the reconnaissance of possible routes to launch counterattacks, fighting off German air attacks, and defending against enemy artillery. On 1 July, the 78th teamed with the 2d Armored Division to relieve the 7th British Armored Division near Caumont. The Germans frequently counterattacked the 2d Armored Division, subjecting it to continuous artillery fire. The 75 played a large role in repulsing these counterattacks. Under heavy artillery shelling, the 78th returned fire without hesitation. On 17 July, the 2d Armored Division was relieved by the 50th British Brigade and began preparing for the St. Lo breakthrough. =Operation cobra= The 2d Armored Division was to attack alongside the 1st Infantry Division and 3d Armored Division. In order to support the advance of the leading elements and to counter the German attacks, the 78th positioned two batteries in a crossroad west of Notre Dame and one battery east of the town. The flexibility of the 78th allowed them to engage targets in opposite directions, providing maximum support to the mission. On 29 July, the Germans attacked with paratroopers and tanks, with the intent to break through to the south and occupy the crossroads. The 78th fired over 500 rounds to break up the German attack against the task force. At 0800 on 29 July, small arms fire grew in intensity north of Battery B and reports told of 200 men and 15 tanks advancing. The 4th Division fell under heavy fire and began to withdraw to Battery B's position. The 4th Division had lost all of its officers and was extremely disorganized. Battery B dropped their howitzers and picked up small arms and machine guns and took positions to block the advance of the Germans. Battery C positioned itself at the crossroad and covered the enemy with direct fire. The 78th, defending with every available weapon, finally halted the German advance. At this time a tank and infantry reserve arrived and drove the enemy forces north. The 78th occupied positions between Lengronne and St. Denis le Gast to support 1St Battalion, 41st Infantry and 1st Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment. After occupying its positions, the 78th continued to exchange fire with the enemy infantry in an attempt to break through to the south. Late in the evening, an enemy column of tanks and infantry infiltrated the area. Batteries A and B used M-7s to destroy the enemy vehicles until the enemy attacked the 78th 's area of operations. The infantry attacked the flanks of the Headquarters Battery and Battery B. Both batteries were drawn into a small arms battle with enemy infantry. Battery A and Battery C fired artillery upon the Germans, providing the support needed for the Headquarters Battery and Battery B to repulse the German attack. 96 German vehicles, including tanks and armored vehicles, were destroyed in the action, and 1,200 Germans were killed in the battle. The 78th suffered 50 dead and 60 wounded. For their actions, the 78th was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the French Croix de Guerre with Silver Star. =Siegfried Line= On 20 September, the 2d Armored Division was relieved by a reinforced cavalry unit and began preparations for the assault on the Siegfried Line. The plan for the breach of the Siegfried Line called for 30th Infantry Division to force a crossing of the Wurm River at two points, and create a penetration of the west wall. The 2d armored Division would then attack through the 30th Division and seize the towns of Linnich and Julich on the Roer River. On 2 October, the 30th Division attacked, meeting strong resistance. They were unable to create a breach before it was decided to send the 2d Armored Division. The 78th participated in the attack by reinforcing the fires of the 30th Division, then supported Combat Command B when the 2d Armored Division began its attack on 3 October. The 78th was the first artillery unit to cross the Siegfried Line. The German resistance was extremely effective and fanatical. The German artillery and tank fire created great confusion, slowing the advance of Combat Command B. During the fighting, the 78th fired continuously. It was the heaviest rate of fire for the battalion during its time in combat. The 2d Armored Division was directed to hold its position until 16 November, when it attacked in an attempt to cross the Roer River. The Germans counterattacked with large armored forces. The 78th helped to repel these counterattacks through its fires. On 28 November, the 2d Armored Division reached the west bank of the Roer, assuming a defensive role. =The Bulge= The 2d Armored Division was given orders to move south to help repel the Germans as they launched a counterattack toward the Meuse River and Liege. On 23 December, contact was established and the division attacked, resulting in the destruction of the 2d Panzer Division. The division launched another attack to pinch off the western portion of the German salient. During these attacks, the 78th operated in support of Combat Command B. Numerous times the battalion organized small task forces to eliminate pockets of Germans hiding in the woods, In January the division went through extensive rehabilitation and maintenance in its preparation to march towards Berlin. =Berlin= On 23 February, the Ninth Army launched its attack on the Rhine. The 78th played a major role in helping the division cross the Rhine and eventually march to Berlin. On 1 April, the 78th, in support of Combat Command B, advanced north of the Ruhr Industrial District completing the closure of the gigantic Ruhr pocket by sinking up with the 3d armored Division. In late April, the division was relieved and assumed military government duties. The 2d Armored Division was selected to be the first unit to occupy the American zone of Berlin. The 2d armored Division returned to the United States to become the only armored division remaining in the U.S. Army. Lineage Constituted on 1 July 1916 and organized 1 June 1917 at Fort Riley, Kansas, the 20th Cavalry was formed from elements of the 13th Cavalry. Such a lineage is enshrined in the unit crest, the numeral 13 in the blazing sun. In November 1917, the 20th Cavalry was re-designated and reformed as the 78th Field Artillery Regiment and assigned to support the 6th Infantry Division. On the crest's wreath of red and gold, the 6 pointed star charged with the number 78 represents the 6th Infantry's insignia and its relationship to the Regiment. Battle participation in Europe was limited and the regiment was inactivated following World War I. The field of the unit crest is red for Artillery. The gold billets are from the coat of arms of Franche-Comté, the area where the 78th Field Artillery Regiment was located during World War I. Beneath the crest is a Scroll with the motto SEMEL ET SIMUL meaning \\"At Once and Together\\". In 1940 the unit was activated as the 78th Field Artillery Battalion, part of the 2nd Armored Division. Re- designated the 78th Armored Field Artillery Battalion in 1942, the unit participated in the campaigns for Algeria-French Morocco, Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, Ardennes-Alsace, Central Europe, and the Rhineland. In 1957 in Germany the regiment was relieved of assignment from the 2nd Armored Division and each of its six batteries were reorganized into separate battalions. A Battery was re-designated as the 1st Battalion, 78th Artillery remained on assignment with the 2nd Armored Division. B Battery was re- designated as the 2nd Battalion, 78th Artillery was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division and later the 1st Armored Division. C Battery was re- designated as the 3rd Battalion, 78th Artillery was withdrawn from the Regular Army and allotted to the Army Reserve's 90th Infantry Division, later inactivated on 31 December 1965. D Battery was re-designated as the 4th Battalion, 78th Artillery was withdrawn from the Regular Army and allotted to the Army Reserve's 102nd Infantry Division, later inactivated on 31 December 1965. E Battery was re-designated as the 5th Battalion, 78th Artillery was assigned to 194th Armored Brigade, later inactivated on 18 May 1970. F Battery was re-designated as the 6th Battalion, 78th Artillery was assigned to the 6th Infantry Division, later inactivated on 25 July 1968. On 1 September 1971 the 78th Artillery was re-designated the 78th Field Artillery under the Combat Arms Regimental System. In October 1988 1st and 2nd Battalion, 78th Field Artillery were inactivated, however shortly thereafter in February 1989 the 1st Battalion, 78th Field Artillery was reactivated and transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma under US Training and Doctrine Command where it continues a distinguished legacy in the conduct of Initial Entry Training Distinctive unit insignia * Description A Gold color metal and enamel device 1 13/32 inches (3.57 cm) in height consisting of the shield, crest and motto of the coat of arms. * Symbolism The background shield of the crest is red for artillery and the gold billets are from the coat of arms of the Duchy of Franche Compte, the area in France where the 78th Artillery was located during World War I.

The species is endemic to North Africa and Western Asia. Three subspecies are sometimes recognised; A. boskianus boskianus, from Lower Egypt; A. boskianus euphraticus from Iraq; and A. boskianus asper from the rest of the range; however this division is unsatisfactory because each subspecies has much variation and the differences between them are not consistent. Description A. boskianus is a medium-sized lizard with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of between . Males are usually larger than females. The feet have long slender digits which are fringed. The dorsal surface is olive-grey with five longitudinal dark stripes, the middle one of which subdivides at the neck. The ventral surface is whitish, but in the female, the underside of the tail becomes suffused with red during the breeding season. In juveniles, the tail is blue. Distribution and habitat A. boskianus is found in Algeria, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, southern Turkey, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. It is one of the most common diurnal lizards over much of its range, and is found in a diversity of habitats, including coastal plains and cultivated areas, saltmarshes, oases and wadis, usually in areas with a light to moderate vegetation cover on sandy or gravelly substrates.

Three clinically distinct forms of this deficiency have been proposed, namely infantile, juvenile, and adult. National Institutes of Health and its Office of Rare Diseases Research branch classifies GKD as a rare disease, known to affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The responsible gene lies in a region containing genes in which deletions can cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy and adrenal hypoplasia congenita. Combinations of these three genetic defects including GKD are addressed medically as Complex GKD.  Signs and symptoms  Glycerol Kinase Deficiency causes the condition known as hyperglycerolemia, an accumulation of glycerol in the blood and urine. This excess of glycerol in bodily fluids can lead to many more potentially dangerous symptoms. Common symptoms include vomiting and lethargy. These tend to be the only symptoms, if any, present in adult GKD which has been found to present with fewer symptoms than infant or juvenile GKD. When GKD is accompanied by Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Adrenal Hypoplasia Congenita, also caused by mutations on the Xp21 chromosome, the symptoms can become much more severe. Symptoms visible at or shortly after birth include: * cryptorchidism * strabismus * seizures Some other symptoms that become more noticeable with time would be: * metabolic acidosis * hypoglycemia * adrenal cortex insufficiency * learning disabilities * osteoporosis * myopathy Many of the physically visible symptoms, such as cryptorchidism, strabismus, learning disabilities, and myopathy, tend to have an added psychological effect on the subject due to the fact that they can set him or her apart from those without GKD. Cryptorchidism, the failure of one or both of the testes to descend to the scrotum, has been known to lead to sexual identity confusion amongst young boys because it is such a major physiological anomaly. Strabismus is the misalignment of one's eyes. Typically, one is focused but the other is “lazy” and is directed inward or out ward (up and down is less common but does occur). Causes Glycerol kinase deficiency has two main causes. *The first cause is isolated enzyme deficiency. The enzyme glycerol kinase is encoded by the X-chromosome in humans. It acts as a catalyst in the phosphorylation of glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate which plays a key role in formation of triacylglycerol (TAG) and fat storage. There is no genotype–phenotype correlation in isolated GKD and it can be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic means that GKD shows symptoms when it persists in the body and asymptomatic means that the no symptoms appear in the body. In this deficiency the genotype is not associated with the phenotype. The presence of certain mutations in genes has no relation with the phenotype i.e. any resulting physical traits or abnormality. Location of the Glycerol Kinase gene on the X chromosome *The second cause is a deletion or mutation of a single gene. GKD is described by Mendelian inheritance and is an X-linked recessive trait due to which it occurs mainly in males and occasionally in females. GKD results when the glycerol kinase gene present on the locus Xp21 of the X chromosome is either deleted or mutated. Females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. The expression of recessive genes on the X chromosome is different in males and females. This is due to the fact that genes present on the Y chromosome do not pair up with genes on the X chromosome in males. In females the disorder is expressed only when there are two copies of the affected gene present on each X chromosome but since the glycerol kinase gene is present only on one X chromosome the disorder is not expressed in women. Women have a second good copy that can compensate for the defect on the first copy. On the other hand, males only need a single copy of the recessive gene for the disorder to be expressed. They do not have a second copy that can protect against any defect on the first copy. Effect on glycolysis The metabolic pathway of glycolysis releases energy by converting glucose to pyruvate by via a series of intermediate metabolites. Each chemical modification (red box) is performed by a different enzyme. In order to understand how this condition affects a person you must first have a basic understanding of the process called glycolysis. This fundamental metabolic pathway is found in all known organisms. The process provides energy for our cells to carry out their daily functions. The overall reaction involves a cell taking in the sugar glucose and converting it into the energy rich molecule pyruvate. Inside the overall reaction there lie many steps that need to be followed in order for the original glucose molecule to be transformed into pyruvate. The glucose first gathers a phosphate group from an ATP molecule in order to become glucose-6-phosphate. It is then changed into fructose 6-phosphate, with the assistance of phosphoglucose isomerase, which is then changed into fructose 1,6-biphosphate when the fructose molecule receives a phosphate group from another ATP. The next step in the chain is crucial for cells in order to make more energy than they expend through the process of glycolysis; this step is when the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate molecule breaks down into two molecules of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), so from this point on whenever ATP is being generated from ADP there are really two ATP molecules generated because there are two molecules undergoing the same reaction., . \\".\\" . University California Davis, 2 Nov. 2010. Web. <> One molecule that takes advantage of this second part of the metabolic process is the fatty molecule glycerol. This is unfortunately prevented if someone is experiencing Glycerol Kinase Deficiency. When a human's body needs to use stored fat for energy it will release glycerol and other fatty acids into the bloodstream. However, these glycerol molecules must contribute to the process of glycolysis before they can provide energy to the body, as they do not hold the necessary energy within themselves. So before glycerol can enter the pathway of glycolysis it must be converted into an intermediate molecule, which in this case is dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). This is where glycerol kinase comes into the picture. The enzyme is used in the first step in turning glycerol into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from an ATP to a glycerol molecule forming glycerol (3) phosphate. Then glycerol 3-phosphate, with the assistance of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, can be dehydrogenated into DHAP. This molecule can then enter the metabolic pathway of glycolysis and provide more energy for the cell. Looking at the entire glycolysis pathway this conversion would yield an extra ATP for each glycerol molecule that eventually made its way into a DHAP molecule, which demonstrates the benefit of releasing glycerol into the bloodstream. However, when suffering from a glycerol kinase deficiency many of the glycerol molecules released into the bloodstream end up not being converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), because the host does not have enough of the enzyme to catalyze all of the reactions waiting to occur. These extra molecules of glycerol are left floating around in the cell and can cause serious damage if left untreated. Diagnosis = Classification= GKD can be divided into three distinct forms: infantile, juvenile, and adult. Out of all of these the infantile form is the most clinically relevant because it leads to developmental delay and adrenal insufficiency. * The infantile form is referred to as complex GKD because the defect in the gene for the glycerol kinase enzyme is interconnected with defects in one or both of its affected genes that are responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and adrenal hypoplasia congenita. The cause of this form is deletion of the Xp21 gene on the X chromosome. Patients have increased levels of serum creatine phosphokinase, which leads to myopathic changes in muscle biopsies resembling Duchenne muscular dystrophy. *The juvenile form does not show myopathy and patients have normal adrenal function. The main cause leading to this form of GKD is isolated enzyme deficiency. *The adult form is also caused by an isolated enzyme deficiency. Patients having this form of the disorder are clinically normal.  Treatment  Treatments for Glycerol Kinase Deficiency are targeted to treat the symptoms because there are no permanent treatments for this disease. The main way to treat these symptoms is by using corticosteroids, glucose infusion, or mineralocorticoids. Corticosteroids are steroid hormones that are naturally produced in the adrenal glands. These hormones regulate stress responses, carbohydrate metabolism, blood electrolyte levels, as well as other uses. The mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone control many electrolyte levels and allow the kidneys to retain sodium. Glucose infusion is coupled with insulin infusion to monitor blood glucose levels and keep them stable. Due to the multitude of varying symptoms of this disease, there is no specific treatment that will cure this disease altogether. The symptoms can be treated with many different treatments and combinations of medicines to try to find the correct combination to offset the specific symptoms. Everyone with Glycerol Kinase Deficiency has varying degrees of symptoms and thereby requires different medicines to be used in combination to treat the symptoms; however, this disease is not curable and the symptoms can only be managed, not treated fully.

It is considered a central business district and features many of the city's wide range of exclusive shops as well as entertainment, hotels and restaurants. The road is known for the frequent Farmer's Markets on weekends as well as its biannual car-free shopping events. Bogstadveien stretches from the neighbourhood Majorstuen to the neighbourhood Hegdehaugen. The street was originally named Sørkedalsveien as it led to Sørkedalen, but was renamed to Bogstadveien when, in 1878, it was incorporated into Oslo. It was named for the Bogstad Manor in Sørkedalen. In 1892, the street was extended in width to serve as the main street towards Majorstuen. On 2 March 1894, the first electric tramway line in Oslo, the Briskeby Line, was opened. The line runs through almost the entirety of the street, and has a single stop named for it, located by the street junction with Industrigaten. Previously the street was served by two stops, named Schultz' gate and Rosenborg, but these were replaced by the eponymous Bogstadveien stop, due to their proximity. In 1892, the street's width was extended to serve as an avenue from the Royal Palace. In 1932, the two last wooden houses in the street were demolished. The writer Aasmund Olavsson Vinje lived in one of these houses, where he became friends with the painter Peder Balke. The writer Peter Christen Asbjørnsen also lived for a while in a house at the intersection of Bogstadveien and Rosenborggaten Street.
