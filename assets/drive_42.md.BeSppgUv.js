Bryan The 1900 United States presidential election took place after an economic recovery from the Panic of 1893 as well as after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, with the economy, foreign policy, and imperialism being the main issues of the campaign. Ultimately, the incumbent U.S. President William McKinley ended up defeating the anti-imperialist William Jennings Bryan and thus won a second four-year term in office. The nomination fight Conservatives in 1900 ridiculed Bryan's eclectic platform. Initially, Admiral George Dewey was the front- runner for the 1900 Democratic presidential nomination after his 1898 victory at the Battle of Manila Bay (during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War). However, the fact that he married a Catholic widow (and gave her a house that grateful citizens had donated to him) as well his lack of knowledge about the role and power of the U.S. Presidency (Dewey said that the U.S. President merely executed the laws that the U.S. Congress passed) caused support for Dewey's candidacy to crumble. With the implosion of Dewey's candidacy, 1896 Democratic presidential nominee and former Congressman William Jennings Bryan became the front-runner for the 1900 Democratic presidential nomination. Even though various prominent Democrats tried to convince Bryan to drop his support of free silver (due to the fact that, unlike in the 1896 election, the economy was recovering and in good shape at this point in time), Bryan refused and threatened to run as an independent if the Democrats didn't adopt a pro-free silver plank. Ultimately, Bryan won out and free silver was put into the 1900 Democratic platform by a one-vote margin--with Bryan becoming the 1900 Democratic presidential nominee. In addition, the Democrats criticized the Republicans for their imperialism, for the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and for the proliferation of trusts. Meanwhile, the Republicans re-nominated incumbent U.S. President William McKinley and chose New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt as McKinley's running mate (McKinley's first Vice President, Garret Hobart, had died in 1899). Campaign During the campaign, McKinley and the Republicans criticized Bryan's adherence support of free silver, claimed credit for the nation's economic recovery from Panic of 1893, called for lower taxes, a larger merchant marine, and an interoceanic canal in Central America. In addition, McKinley argued that trusts were \\"dangerous conspiracies against the public good and should be made the subject of prohibitory or penal legislation.\\" Also, McKinley and the Republicans rejected both immediate independence for the Philippines and Bryan's idea of a protectorate for them, claiming that a Philippine protectorate would leave the U.S. responsible for the Philippines without the authority to meet its obligations. Meanwhile, McKinley's campaign manager and Ohio Senator Mark Hanna raised $2.5 million ($53.2 million in 2002 dollars), a million less than in 1896, but five times more than Democrats raised in 1900. In addition, the Hanna-led Republican National Committee distributed 125 million pieces of campaign literature, including McKinley's letter of acceptance translated into German, Polish, and other languages. During the campaign, McKinley's running mate Theodore Roosevelt vehemently criticized the Democrats and their platform (while also defending the gold standard). Meanwhile, Bryan ran against the imperialism of McKinley and the Republicans and argued that imperialism is directly opposed to basic American values. In addition, Bryan campaigned in favor of campaign finance reform and associated Republicans with big business and trusts (and their abuses) following a gaffe by Hanna (where he said that trusts no longer exist because they were outlawed). While Bryan made a whopping 546 speeches to an audience of two-and-a-half million people during the 1900 campaign, Theodore Roosevelt's speeches during this campaign ended up reaching more people (with Roosevelt giving 673 speeches to an audience of three million people). In addition, Bryan was hurt by the inadequate financing and organization of the Democratic Party in 1900. Results Ultimately, McKinley won the popular vote by a 52% to 46% margin and won the electoral vote by a 292 to 155 margin. Indeed, McKinley's victory margin was greater than it had been in 1896, and might have been even larger had it not been for the intimidation of Black voters in the Southern United States (in the South, only 40% of all eligible voters actually voted in 1900). In addition, Republicans picked up two seats in the U.S. Senate and 11 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1900, raising their totals to 57 seats in the Senate and 198 seats in the House. Overall, the 1900 election continued the political realignment which was begun by the 1896 election, having established the Republicans as the dominant political party in the U.S. until the 1920s.

Harper (born in 1974) is an American sculptor, musician, and academic. He is best known for his vocals and tenor guitar, especially in France, where has had made two concert tours.  Biography  Harper was born in 1974, the youngest child of a black father and a white Jewish mother, multi-instrumentalist Ellen Harper (n√©e Chase). They divorced before Peter was two years old, and he and his elder brothers, Ben and Joel, were raised by their mother. Friday and Saturday nights she played in a band, working the rest of the time at her parents' music store, the Folk Music Center, in Claremont, California. The shop was a music hub. It sold and repaired instruments, gave music lessons, hosted performances, and in 1976 added a museum of rare and antique instruments and folk art. Harper received no formal art instruction at school, but in the afternoons hung out at the store, where he was exposed to all kinds of instruments, music, and musicians. There he learned instrument repair and started crafting small ceramic sculptures. In his late teens and early twenties, he dabbled with playing guitar, but was unsatisfied with it. Harper attended Pitzer College in Claremont, where he majored in political studies with an emphasis on the Third World. A semester studying abroad in Zimbabwe when he was 19 was extended after he was admitted to the Mzilikazi Arts and Crafts Centre in Bulawayo. There he received intensive formal training in figural sculpture. The next year he returned to Pitzer, and completed his BA in 1996. He went on to earn an MA in art at New York University (NYU). After graduate school he returned to Pomona, California, where he learned mold making, and bronze became his favorite medium of sculpture. Through 2006, he averaged about two exhibitions a year, in California and New York. Harper wasn't a surfer until his brother Ben tried it and rhapsodized about the experience. Peter got a friend who surfs to take him out, and was immediately hooked. Not long thereafter, at the filming of the music video for Ben's 2003 song With My Own Two Hands, Peter met three brothers who allowed that they surfed \\"sometimes\\", and invited him to join them. When he did, it immediately became obvious that they were experts, although it wasn't until later that Harper learned the three, Chris, Dan, and Keith Malloy, are famous surfers. It was partly through the Malloys that in 2005 Harper became involved with the Surfrider Foundation. Chris Malloy was helping coordinate a charity art auction for the environmental organization, and asked him to participate. Harper turned a surfboard into a work of art for the fundraiser. It marked the beginning of his commitment to environmental awareness. In August 2006 he joined California State University Channel Islands as a lecturer in art. In his mid-thirties he circled back to music, falling in love with the ukulele, and then the tenor guitar (a four-string relative of the guitar, banjo, and ukulele), and starting to write songs. As he expresses it, He continued to sculpt and teach, but focused increasingly on his music. In 2013, Harper released his self-titled debut album of eleven tracks. He made a solo tour of France in May 2016, playing 17 concerts in intimate venues, mostly in the southwest. A European edition of his first album followed in January 2017, with two additional tracks: an acoustic version of \\"Take it Home\\", and an English-French bilingual version of \\"Can't Stop Now\\". At a studio run by Sheldon Gomberg, he recorded a second album, Break the Cycle, with some of the musicians who tour with him in the United States as \\"Racing Alone\\". The name of the group echos his conviction that people focus too much on competition, whereas the competition that matters is with oneself, to be better tomorrow than yesterday. He made a second European tour of 28 dates in January‚ÄìFebruary 2017, concentrated in France, but also including Belgium, England, Spain, and Switzerland. The tour was organized in conjunction with the Surfrider Foundation Europe, for which he formally became an ambassador. Break the Cycle was released in April.

Early life Brudenall was the son of James Brudenell MP and his wife Susanna Burton, daughter of Bartholomew Burton of North Luffenham, Rutland. He was educated at Hackney and was admitted at Peterhouse, Cambridge on 7 April 1743. He succeeded his father in 1746 and was equerry to King George II from 1746 to 1760. Political career Brudenell's political career was effectively run by Lord Exeter. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Rutland in a by-election in 1754. In 1756, he received a secret service pension of ¬£500 per year. When King George III came to the throne in 1760, he was offered the renewal of his place as equerry, but did not press to take it. Because Exeter wanted to place his brother at Rutland at the next election Brudenell was transferred to Stamford for the 1761 general election where he was returned unopposed.

Reinforcement is a process of speciation where natural selection increases the reproductive isolation (further divided to pre-zygotic isolation and post-zygotic isolation) between two populations of species. This occurs as a result of selection acting against the production of hybrid individuals of low fitness. The idea was originally developed by Alfred Russel Wallace and is sometimes referred to as the Wallace effect. The modern concept of reinforcement originates from Theodosius Dobzhansky. He envisioned a species separated allopatrically, where during secondary contact the two populations mate, producing hybrids with lower fitness. Natural selection results from the hybrid's inability to produce viable offspring; thus members of one species who do not mate with members of the other have greater reproductive success. This favors the evolution of greater prezygotic isolation (differences in behavior or biology that inhibit formation of hybrid zygotes). Reinforcement is one of the few cases in which selection can favor an increase in prezygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly. This aspect has been particularly appealing among evolutionary biologists. The support for reinforcement has fluctuated since its inception, and terminological confusion and differences in usage over history have led to multiple meanings and complications. Various objections have been raised by evolutionary biologists as to the plausibility of its occurrence. Since the 1990s, data from theory, experiments, and nature have overcome many of the past objections, rendering reinforcement widely accepted, though its prevalence in nature remains unknown. Numerous models have been developed to understand its operation in nature, most relying on several facets: genetics, population structures, influences of selection, and mating behaviors. Empirical support for reinforcement exists, both in the laboratory and in nature. Documented examples are found in a wide range of organisms: both vertebrates and invertebrates, fungi, and plants. The secondary contact of originally separated incipient species (the initial stage of speciation) is increasing due to human activities such as the introduction of invasive species or the modification of natural habitats. This has implications for measures of biodiversity and may become more relevant in the future.  History  Reinforcement has had a complex history in that its popularity among scholars has changed over time. Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr contend that the theory of reinforcement went through three phases of historical development: # plausibility based on unfit hybrids # implausibility based on hybrids having some fitness # plausibility based on empirical studies and biologically complex and realistic models Alfred Russel Wallace proposed in 1889 that isolation could be strengthened by a form of selection. Sometimes called the Wallace effect, reinforcement was originally proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1889. His hypothesis differed markedly from the modern conception in that it focused on post-zygotic isolation, strengthened by group selection.M. J. Littlejohn (1981). Reproductive isolation: A critical review. In W. R. Atchley and D. S. Woodruff (eds) Evolution and Speciation, Cambridge University Press, Pp. 298‚Äì334. Theodosius Dobzhansky was the first to provide a thorough description of the process in 1937, though the term itself was not coined until 1955 by W. Frank Blair. In 1930, Ronald Fisher laid out the first genetic description of the process of reinforcement in The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, and in 1965 and 1970 the first computer simulations were run to test for its plausibility. Later population genetic and quantitative genetic studies were conducted showing that completely unfit hybrids lead unequivocally to an increase in prezygotic isolation. Dobzhansky's idea gained significant support; he suggested that it illustrated the final step in speciation, for example after an allopatric population comes into secondary contact. In the 1980s, many evolutionary biologists began to doubt the plausibility of the idea, based not on empirical evidence, but largely on the growth of theory that deemed it an unlikely mechanism of reproductive isolation. A number of theoretical objections arose at the time and are addressed in the Arguments against reinforcement section below. By the early 1990s, reinforcement saw a revival in popularity among evolutionary biologists; due primarily from a sudden increase in data‚Äîempirical evidence from studies in labs and largely by examples found in nature. Further, computer simulations of the genetics and migration patterns of populations found, \\"something looking like reinforcement\\". The most recent theoretical work on speciation has come from several studies (notably from Liou and Price, Kelly and Noor, and Kirkpatrick and Servedio) using highly complex computer simulations; all of which came to similar conclusions: that reinforcement is plausible under several conditions, and in many cases, is easier than previously thought.  Terminology  Confusion exists around the meaning of the term reinforcement. It was first used to describe the observed mating call differences in Gastrophryne frogs within a secondary contact hybrid zone. The term secondary contact has also been used to describe reinforcement in the context of an allopatrically separated population experiencing contact after the loss of a geographic barrier. The Wallace effect is similar to reinforcement, but is rarely used. Roger Butlin demarcated incomplete post- zygotic isolation from complete isolation, referring to incomplete isolation as reinforcement and completely isolated populations as experiencing reproductive character displacement. Daniel J. Howard considered reproductive character displacement to represent either assortive mating or the divergence of traits for mate recognition (specifically between sympatric populations). Reinforcement, under his definition, included prezygotic divergence and complete post-zygotic isolation. Servedio and Noor include any detected increase in prezygotic isolation as reinforcement, as long as it is a response to selection against mating between two different species. Coyne and Orr contend that, \\"true reinforcement is restricted to cases in which isolation is enhanced between taxa that can still exchange genes\\".  Models  rightthumbupright=1.3The four outcomes of secondary contact: 1. An extrinsic barrier separates a species population into two but they come into contact before reproductive isolation is sufficient to result in speciation. The two populations fuse back into one species 2. Speciation by reinforcement 3. Two separated populations stay genetically distinct while hybrid swarms form in the zone of contact 4. Genome recombination results in speciation of the two populations, with an additional hybrid species. All three species are separated by intrinsic reproductive barriers One of the strongest forms of reproductive isolation in nature is sexual isolation: traits in organisms involving mating. This pattern has led to the idea that, because selection acts so strongly on mating traits, it may be involved in the process of speciation. This process of speciation influenced by natural selection is reinforcement, and can happen under any mode of speciation (e.g. geographic modes of speciation or ecological speciation). It necessitates two forces of evolution that act on mate choice: natural selection and gene flow. Selection acts as the main driver of reinforcement as it selects against hybrid genotypes that are of low-fitness, regardless if individual preferences have no effect on survival and reproduction. Gene flow acts as the primary opposing force against reinforcement, as the exchange of genes between individuals leading to hybrids cause the genotypes to homogenize. Butlin laid out four primary criteria for reinforcement to be detected in natural or laboratory populations: *Gene flow between two taxa exists or can be established to have existed at some point. *There is divergence of mating-associated traits between two taxa. *Patterns of mating are modified, limiting the production of low fitness hybrids. *Other selection pressures leading to divergence of the mate-recognition system have not occurred. After speciation by reinforcement occurs, changes after complete reproductive isolation (and further isolation thereafter) are a form of reproductive character displacement. A common signature of reinforcement's occurrence in nature is that of reproductive character displacement; characteristics of a population diverge in sympatry but not allopatry. One difficulty in detection is that ecological character displacement can result in the same patterns. Further, gene flow can diminish the isolation found in sympatric populations. Two important factors in the outcome of the process rely on: 1) the specific mechanisms that causes prezygotic isolation, and 2) the number of alleles altered by mutations affecting mate choice. In instances of peripatric speciation, reinforcement is unlikely to complete speciation in the case that the peripherally isolated population comes into secondary contact with the main population. In sympatric speciation, selection against hybrids is required; therefore reinforcement can play a role, given the evolution of some form of fitness trade-offs. In sympatry, patterns of strong mating discrimination are often observed‚Äîbeing attributed to reinforcement. Reinforcement is thought to be the agent of gametic isolation.  Genetics  The underlying genetics of reinforcement can be understood by an ideal model of two haploid populations experiencing an increase in linkage disequilibrium. Here, selection rejects low fitness Bc or bC allele combinations while favoring combinations of BC alleles (in the first subpopulation) and bc alleles (in the second subpopulation). The third locus A or a (the assortive mating alleles) have an effect on mating pattern but is not under direct selection. If selection at B and C cause changes in the frequency of allele A, assortive mating is promoted, resulting in reinforcement. Both selection and assortive mating are necessary, that is, that matings of A times A and a times a are more common than matings of a times A and A times a. A restriction of migration between populations can further increase the chance of reinforcement, as it decreases the probability of the differing genotypes to exchange. An alternative model exists to address the antagonism of recombination, as it can reduce the association between the alleles that involve fitness and the assortive mating alleles that do not. Genetic models often differ in terms of the number of traits associated with loci; with some relying on one locus per trait and others on polygenic traits.  Population structures  The structure and migration patterns of a population can affect the process of speciation by reinforcement. It has been shown to occur under an island model, harboring conditions with infrequent migrations occurring in one direction, and in symmetric migration models where species migrate evenly back and forth between populations. A parameter space representing the conditions in which speciation by reinforcement can occur. Here, three outcomes can arise: 1) extinction of one of the initial populations; 2) the initial populations can hybridize; 3) the initial populations can speciate. The outcomes are determined by both initial divergence and level of fitness of the hybrids. Reinforcement can also occur in single populations, mosaic hybrid zones (patchy distributions of parental forms and subpopulations), and in parapatric populations with narrow contact zones. Population densities are an important factor in reinforcement, often in conjunction with extinction. It is possible that, when two species come into secondary contact, one population can become extinct‚Äîprimarily due to low hybrid fitness accompanied by high population growth rates. Extinction is less likely if the hybrids are inviable instead of infertile, as fertile individuals can still survive long enough to reproduce.  Selection  Speciation by reinforcement relies directly on selection to favor an increase in prezygotic isolation, and the nature of selection's role in reinforcement has been widely discussed, with models applying varying approaches. Selection acting on hybrids can occur in several different ways. All hybrids produced may be equality low-fitness, conferring a broad disadvantage. In other cases, selection may favor multiple and varying phenotypes such as in the case of a mosaic hybrid zone. Natural selection can act on specific alleles both directly or indirectly. In direct selection, the frequency of the selected allele is favored to the extreme. In cases where an allele is indirectly selected, its frequency increases due to a different linked allele experiencing selection (linkage disequilibrium). The condition of the hybrids under selection can play a role in post-zygotic isolation, as hybrid inviability (a hybrid unable to mature into a fit adult) and sterility (the inability to produce offspring entirely) prohibit gene flow between populations. Selection against the hybrids can even be driven by any failure to obtain a mate, as it is effectively indistinguishable from sterility‚Äîeach circumstance results in no offspring.  Mating and mate preference  Some initial divergence in mate preference must be present for reinforcement to occur. Any traits that promote isolation may be subjected to reinforcement such as mating signals (e.g. courtship display), signal responses, the location of breeding grounds, the timing of mating (e.g. seasonal breeding), or even egg receptivity. Individuals may also discriminate against mates that differ in various traits such as mating call or morphology. Many of these examples are described below.  Evidence  sympatry, divergence is exhibited by changes in mating traits. These patterns of reproductive character displacement detected in species populations that exist in zones of overlap indicate that the process of speciation by reinforcement has occurred. The evidence for reinforcement comes from observations in nature, comparative studies, and laboratory experiments.  Nature  Reinforcement can be shown to be occurring (or to have occurred in the past) by measuring the strength of prezygotic isolation in a sympatric population in comparison to an allopatric population of the same species. Comparative studies of this allow for determining large-scale patterns in nature across various taxa. Mating patterns in hybrid zones can also be used to detect reinforcement. Reproductive character displacement is seen as a result of result of reinforcement, so many of the cases in nature express this pattern in sympatry. Reinforcement's ubiquity is unknown, but the patterns of reproductive character displacement are found across numerous taxa and is considered to be a common occurrence in nature. Studies of reinforcement in nature often prove difficult, as alternative explanations for the detected patterns can be asserted. Nevertheless, empirical evidence exists for reinforcement occurring across various taxa and its role in precipitating speciation is conclusive.  Comparative studies  Prezygotic isolation in allopatric (red) and sympatric (blue) species pairs of Drosophila. Gradients indicate the predictions of reinforcement for allopatric and sympatric populations. Assortive mating is expected to increase among sympatric populations experiencing reinforcement. This fact allows for the direct comparison of the strength of prezygotic isolation in sympatry and allopatry between different experiments and studies. Coyne and Orr surveyed 171 species pairs, collecting data on their geographic mode, genetic distance, and strength of both prezygotic and postzygotic isolation; finding that prezygotic isolation was significantly stronger in sympatric pairs, correlating with the ages of the species. Additionally, the strength of post-zygotic isolation was not different between sympatric and allopatric pairs. This finding supports the predictions of speciation by reinforcement and correlates well with a later study that found 33 studies expressing patterns of strong prezygotic isolation in sympatry. A survey of the rates of speciation in fish and their associated hybrid zones found similar patterns in sympatry, supporting the occurrence of reinforcement.A. R. McCune and N. R. Lovejoy. (1998). The relative rate of sympatric and allopatric speciation in fishes. In D. J. Howard and S. H. Berlocher (eds) Endless Forms: Species and Speciation, Oxford University Press, pp. 172‚Äì185.  Laboratory experiments  Laboratory studies that explicitly test for reinforcement are limited, with many of the experiments having been conducted on Drosophila fruit flies. In general, two types of experiments have been conducted: using artificial selection to mimic natural selection that eliminates the hybrids (often called \\"destroy-the- hybrids\\"), and using disruptive selection to select for a trait (regardless of its function in sexual reproduction). Many experiments using the destroy-the- hybrids technique are generally cited as supportive of reinforcement; however, some researchers such as Coyne and Orr and William R. Rice and Ellen E. Hostert contend that they do not truly model reinforcement, as gene flow is completely restricted between two populations.  Alternative hypotheses  Various alternative explanations for the patterns observed in nature have been proposed. There is no single, overarching signature of reinforcement; however, there are two proposed possibilities: that of sex asymmetry (where females in sympatric populations are forced to become choosy in the face of two differing males)L. Partridge and G. A. Parker. (1999). Sexual conflict and speciation. In A. E. Magurran and R. M. May (eds) Evolution of Biological Diversity. Oxford University Press, pp.130‚Äì159 and that of allelic dominance: any of the alleles experiencing selection for isolation should be dominate. Though this signature does not fully account for fixation probabilities or ecological character displacement. Coyne and Orr extend the sex asymmetry signature and contend that, regardless of the change seen in females and males in sympatry, isolation is driven more by females.  Ecological or ethological influences  Ecology can also play a role in the observed patterns‚Äîcalled ecological character displacement. Natural selection may drive the reduction of an overlap of niches between species instead of acting to reduce hybridization Though one experiment in stickleback fish that explicitly tested this hypotheses found no evidence. Species interactions can also result in reproductive character displacement (in both mate preference or mating signal). Examples include predation and competition pressures, parasites, deceptive pollination, and mimicry. Because these and other factors can result in reproductive character displacement, Conrad J. Hoskin and Megan Higgie give five criteria for reinforcement to be distinguished between ecological and ethological influences: > (1) mating traits are identified in the focal species; (2) mating traits are > affected by a species interaction, such that selection on mating traits is > likely; (3) species interactions differ among populations (present vs. > absent, or different species interactions affecting mating traits in each > population); (4) mating traits (signal and/or preference) differ among > populations due to differences in species interactions; (5) speciation > requires showing that mating trait divergence results in complete or near > complete sexual isolation among populations. Results will be most > informative in a well-resolved biogeographic setting where the relationship > and history among populations is known.  Fusion  It is possible that the pattern of enhanced isolation could simply be a temporary outcome of secondary contact where two allopatric species already have a varying range of prezygotic isolation: with some exhibiting more than others. Those that have weaker prezygotic isolation will eventually fuse, losing their distinctiveness. This hypothesis does not explain the fact that individual species in allopatry, experiencing consistent gene flow, would not differ in levels of gene flow upon secondary contact. Furthermore, patterns detected in Drosophila find high levels of prezygotic isolation in sympatry but not in allopatry. The fusion hypothesis predicts that strong isolation should be found in both allopatry and sympatry. This fusion process is thought to occur in nature, but does not fully explain the patterns found with reinforcement.  Sympatry  Phylogenetic signature to distinguish sympatric speciation from reinforcement. Stronger prezygotic isolation (indicated by the red boxes and associated arrows) should be detected between Z and Y and between Z and X if species Z sympatrically speciated (green) from the common ancestor of species Y and X. If Z, Y, and X speciated allopatrically (blue), with Z and Y experiencing secondary contact, strong prezygotic isolation should be found between Z and Y, but not between Z and X. It is possible that the process of sympatric speciation itself may result in the observed patterns of reinforcement. One method of distinguishing between the two is to construct a phylogenetic history of the species, as the strength of prezygotic isolation between a group of related species should differ according to how they speciated in the past. Two other ways to determine if reinforcement occurs (as opposed to sympatric speciation) are: * if two recently speciated taxa do not show signs of post-zygotic isolation of both sympatric and allopatric populations (in sympatric speciation, post- zygotic isolation is not a prerequisite); * if a cline exists between two species over a range of traits (sympatric speciation does not require a cline to exist at all).  Sexual selection  In a runaway process (not unlike Fisherian runaway selection), selection against the low-fitness hybrids favors assortive mating, increasing mate discrimination rapidly. Additionally, when there is a low cost to female mate preferences, changes in male phenotypes can result, expressing a pattern identical to that of reproductive character displacement. Post-zygotic isolation is not needed, initiated simply by the fact that unfit hybrids cannot get mates.  Arguments against reinforcement  A number of objections were put forth, mainly during the 1980s, arguing that reinforcement is implausible. Most rely on theoretical work which suggested that the antagonism between the forces of natural selection and gene flow were the largest barriers to its feasibility. These objections have since been largely contradicted by evidence from nature.  Gene flow  Concerns about hybrid fitness playing a role in reinforcement has led to objections based on the relationship between selection and recombination. That is, if gene flow is not zero (if hybrids aren't completely unfit), selection cannot drive the fixation of alleles for prezygotic isolation. For example: If population X has the prezygotic isolating allele A and the high fitness, post- zygotic alleles B and C; and population Y has the prezygotic allele a and the high fitness, post-zygotic alleles b and c, both ABC and abc genotypes will experience recombination in the face of gene flow. Somehow, the populations must be maintained. In addition, specific alleles that have the selective advantage within the overlapped populations are only useful within that population.J. A. Moore. (1957). An embryologist's view of the species concept. In Ernst Mayr (eds) The Species Problem, American Association for the Advancement of Science, pp. 325‚Äì338. However, if they are selectively advantageous, gene flow should allow the alleles to spread throughout both populations. To prevent this, the alleles would have to be deleterious or neutral. This is not without problems, as gene flow from the presumably large allopatric regions could overwhelm the area when two populations overlap. For reinforcement to work, gene flow must be present, but very limited. Recent studies suggest reinforcement can occur under a wider range of conditions than previously thought and that the effect of gene flow can be overcome by selection. For example, the two species Drosophila santomea and D. yakuba on the African island S√£o Tom√© occasionally hybridize with one another, resulting in fertile female offspring and sterile male offspring. This natural setting was reproduced in the laboratory, directly modeling reinforcement: the removal of some hybrids and the allowance of varying levels of gene flow. The results of the experiment strongly suggested that reinforcement works under a variety of conditions, with the evolution of sexual isolation arising in 5‚Äì10 fruit fly generations.  Rapid requirements  In conjunction with the fusion hypothesis, reinforcement can be thought of as a race against both fusion and extinction. The production of unfit hybrids is effectively the same as a heterozygote disadvantage; whereby a deviation from genetic equilibrium causes the loss of the unfit allele. This effect would result in the extinction of one of the populations. This objection is overcome by when both populations are not subject to the same ecological conditions. Though, it is still possible for extinction of one population to occur, and has been shown in population simulations. For reinforcement to occur, prezygotic isolation must happen quickly.

It shows superior workmanship in its construction, possibly being the enlargement of a pre-existing cave. The cave or grotto lies downstream of the confluence of the Dippol Burn with the River Lugar and is reached via a once well formed path, however access is now hazardous due to the condition of the cliff edge path and the vertical drop into the River Lugar. Cave and access The interior of Wallace's Cave The cave is a Category B Listed Building that is reached via a narrow path and some rock cut steps that follow the River Lugar gorge. Lying within a side gorge cut by a small burn the final approach requires the crossing of the burn. The masons chisel marks are very clear on the walls and their work created a chamber with a floor area of approximately 14 square feet with prominent rib vaults that rise from the four corners meeting at the central roof apex, thus creating the impression, deliberately or not, of a cross or Saltire. The cave height is approximately ten feet and access is via a pointed seven foot high arched doorway, now minus its door, with one small, similarly shaped window to left as seen from the outside. The window shows no obvious sign of having been glazed. The eminent antiquarian John Smith visited the area circa 1895 recording historic sites but makes no reference to the two caves on the estate. It has been suggested that this or a previous cave dates from the late 13th or 14th century. Warrick, writing in 1899, makes no reference to Wallace's Cave at this site although he mentions one near Lugar in the Cubs' Glen on the Glenmuir Water. John Thomson's map of 1832 does not mark the cave however the natural feature Kemp's Castle and the ruins of Ochiltree Castle and Auchinleck Castle are shown. The 1857 OS map shows a path leading to the site with no cave indicated, however by 1896 it is recorded. The 1908 map records the cave however the access path is no longer shown. Other Wallace's Cave sites A Wallace's Cave or Hawthornden Castle Cave exists in Roslin Glen, in Midlothian. Hawthornden Castle stands nearby and the patriot took part in the Battle of Rosslyn on 24 February 1303. A Wallace's Cave was located in Bothwell Parish on the South Calder Water, Lanarkshire, to the west of Cleland and close to the site of the old Ravenscraig Steelworks. Crawhill in Lothian has a Wallace's Cave that is said to have been used by him after the Battle of Falkirk. The River Clyde has an example at Corra Linn near New Lanark, Lanarkshire. On the opposite side of the River Ayr from Wallace's Heel Well a Wallace's Cave was located and it is said that William Wallace used it to hide from English troops. No sign of it remains. A natural cave in the Cartland Craigs (NS 8691 4454) ravine in South Lanarkshire is locally said to have been used as a refuge by William Wallace. Tradition identifies a Wallace's Cave located at a rock shelter near Lugar in the Cubs' Glen on the Glenmuir Water. History The interior of Samuel Johnson's Summer House It has been estimated as dating from circa 1760 and has been hewn from soft red sandstone in the Gothic style as a man-made folly or grotto, although the possibility remains that it was an extension of a natural cave. The RCAHMS Canmore site classifies the site as post-medieval and holds no details of the grotto. The original Auchinleck Castle stands upstream of the cave just above the confluence of the Dippol Burn with the River Lugar. It was common practice during times of war or unrest to hide valuables, charters, etc. in safe locations and it is possible that Wallace's Cave may have been first made for this purpose as was the case with Bruce's Cave at Kirkpatrick Fleming. The first Laird of Auchinleck or Affleck on record was Nicol de Achethlec or Achethlic who was a great supporter of Scottish independence and is said to have been related to Sir William Wallace. It is known that Nicol rode with Wallace to Glasgow where the English soldiers were defeated at the 'Battle of the Bell of the Brae'. It has been surmised that the grotto's name patriotically commemorates the romantic Boswell family association with the national hero and that it is contemporary with the surviving Gothic grotto variously known as Dr Johnson's Summerhouse, 'Boswell's Summerhouse' or the 'Deer Cave' situated further upstream on the Dippol Burn near the Ten Shillings Bridge, making two grottoes hewn in the picturesque landscape circa 1760 to enhance the new Auchinleck House and pleasure gardens. Micro- history A visitor to one of the caves in circa 1947 describes a walk that takes him to \\"a staircase of broad wooden steps built into the steep bank, but so deep in leaves that the stepping places were hard to distinguish. It led down to the water's edge, and gave access to a large cave hewn in the solid rock. A fine dry apartment it was, and to sit on the carved ledge and watch the wagtails dipping from stone to stone, the burn clear as a sheet of crystal, was most restful.\\" This may refer to the summerhouse named in Dr Samuel Johnson's honour.

This contact allows for the potential for the exchange of genes, dependent on how reproductively isolated the two populations have become. There are several primary outcomes of secondary contact: extinction of one species, fusion of the two populations back into one, reinforcement, the formation of a hybrid zone, and the formation of a new species through hybrid speciation.  Extinction  One of the two populations may go extinct due to competitive exclusion after secondary contact. This tends to happen when the two populations have strong reproductive isolation and significant overlap in their niche. A possible way to prevent extinction is if there is an advantage to being rare. For example, sexual imprinting and male-male competition may prevent extinction. Yang, Y., Servedio, M. R., & Richards-Zawacki, C. L. (2019). Imprinting sets the stage for speciation. Nature, 574(7776), 99-102. The population that goes extinct may leave behind some of its genes in the surviving population if they hybridize. For example, the secondary contact between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, as well as the Denisovans, left traces of their genes in modern human. However, if hybridization is so common that the resulting population received significant amount of genetic contribution from both populations, the result should be considered a fusion.  Fusion  The two populations may fuse back into one population. This tends to occur when there is little to no reproductive isolation between the two. During the process of fusion a hybrid zone may occur. This is sometimes called introgressive hybridization or reverse speciation. Concerns have been raised that the homogenizing of the environment may contribute to more and more fusion, leading to the loss of biodiversity. Seehausen, O. (2006). Conservation: losing biodiversity by reverse speciation. Current Biology, 16(9), R334-R337.  Hybrid zones  A hybrid zone may appear during secondary contact, meaning there would be an area where the two populations cohabitate and produce hybrids, often arranged in a cline. The width of the zone may vary from tens of meters to several hundred kilometers. A hybrid zone may be stable, or it may not. Some shift in one direction, which may eventually lead to the extinction of the receding population. Some expand over time until the two populations fuse. Reinforcement may occur in hybrid zones. Hybrid zones are important study systems for speciation.  Reinforcement  Reinforcement is the evolution towards increased reproductive isolation due to selection against hybridization. This occurs when the populations already have some reproductive isolation, but still hybridize to some extent. Because hybridization is costly (e.g. giving birth and raising a weak offspring), natural selection favors strong isolation mechanisms that can avoid such outcome, such as assortative mating.Kirkpatrick, M. (2000). Reinforcement and divergence under assortative mating. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences, 267(1453), 1649-1655. Evidence for speciation by reinforcement has been accumulating since the 1990s.  Hybrid speciation  Occasionally, the hybrids may be able to survive and reproduce, but not backcross with either of the two parental lineages, thus becoming a new species. This often occur in plants through polyploidy, including in many important food crops. Occasionally, the hybrids may lead to the extinction of one or both parental lineages.

He was suffect consul for the nundinium September to December AD 88 as the colleague of Marcus Otacilius Catulus.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 191, 217 Since the recovery of a military diploma bearing his name, Julius Sparsus has been often identified as the man to whom Pliny the Younger wrote two letters on literary matters,Epistulae IV.5; VIII.3 and as the recipient of one of Martial's poems.Martial, XII.57 Experts did not seriously question this identification as his cognomen \\"Sparsus\\" is, as Ronald Syme wrote in an article published in the Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, \\"preternaturally rare\\". He was only able to find it in the names of three provincials -- one living in Nemausus and two in Tarraconensis -- and two Romans, a rhetor frequently cited by Seneca the Elder, and Gaius Lusius Sparsus, suffect consul in 157;Syme, \\"Pliny the Procurator\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, 73 (1969), pp. 231f the existence of a third Roman with this cognomen, Gaius Pomponius Rufus Acilius Priscus Coelius Sparsus, consul in 98, was learned of after Syme wrote his paper. However, it has been pointed out that the chronology is against this identification with the consul. According to the Lex Villia Annalis, Julius Sparsus had to be no younger than 42 when he acceded to the suffect consulship in the year 88; both of Pliny's letters have been dated between the years 105 and 108, which would have made Sparsus in his sixties when the letters were written; neither letter is written in a tone suggesting they were addressed to someone older than the always correct Pliny would normally write. This has led some academics, such as R.A. Pitcher, to argue that Pliny's letters and Martial's poem are actually addressed to Sparsus' son of the same name, likely five or ten years younger than Pliny.Pitcher, \\"A Prosopographical Note on Martial XII 57\\", Mnemosyne, Fourth Series, 37 (1984), pp. 454-457 There is evidence suggesting Julius Sparsus the consul may have been a proconsular governor of Africa. Michel Christol has published a fragmentary inscription from Uthina in modern Tunisia of which two lines are readable. The second line clearly contains the cognomen \\"Sparsus\\". Christol first suggests this may refer to Julius Sparsus, but the other two surviving letters forces him to reject that identification; he then argues for an identification with the suffect consul of 98 mentioned above, Coelius Sparsus. While it is possible Julius Sparsus was governor of Africa -- one of the pinnacles of a successful Senatorial career -- it is only a slight possibility.Christol, \\"A Propos d'inscriptions latines d'Uthina (Oudhna, Tunisie)\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 178 (2011), pp. 285-299  References  1st-century Romans Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Sparsus ","title":"Sextus Julius Sparsus"},{"id":"55298771","text":"Daybreak () is a 1954 West German drama film directed by Viktor Tourjansky and starring Hans St√ºwe, Elisabeth M√ºller and Alexander Kerst.Silberman p. 131 The film's sets were designed by the art director Arne Flekstad.

The Mohill plague occurred following the Extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536 and death of Manch√°n of Mohill. Evidence Evidence for the Justinian plague in Mohill barony is revealed by the names of three contiguous townlands south west of Mohill town‚ÄîTamlaght More, Tamlaght Beg, and Tamlaghtavally‚Äîall surrounding the former monastery of Mohill. Because Tamlaght () is a pagan name, all three townland names are ancient and pre-Christian in origin. Recognition that the word tamlacht signifies a plague burial site is widespread, but most communities are unaware of their ancient ancestors' experiences. Knowledge of the plague at Mohill emerged after 1975, when a local school teacher named Gaffney, wrote his account: Hanley (2002) also identifies Mohill barony with the Justinian plague. He noted nearly all 41 Tamlachta sites in the northern half of Ireland are associated with water - with the exception of Mohill. However, Mohill () is connected to waterways ‚Äî the nearby Lough Rinn feeds the Rinn river, itself a tributary of the Shannon river. Hanley believed the bordering Airg√≠alla kingdom was uniquely hard hit by pandemic. Dooley believes another epidemic in A.D. 550, christened the croin Chonaill (redness of C.), or the buidhe Chonaill (yellowness of C.), suggests a fairly widespread outbreak focused on the Shannon area. Causes Tamlaghtavally townland, Mohill Parish, County Leitrim A sudden climate change in the decade after 538 can be observed from dendrochonology studies of Irish trees, and the arrival of the bubonic plague in Ireland c. A.D. 544, seems to correlate with the westward trajectory of the Justinianic plague, which had reached Gaul by A.D. 543. The Four Masters states: \\"543 AD, an extraordinary universal plague through the world, which swept away the noblest third part of the human race\\", and the Annals of Ulster christened the pandemic \\"bl√©fed\\". It is estimated 25‚Äì50 million, or 40% of European population, died over two centuries as the plague returned periodically up until the 8th century. Heritage Mullaun (c. 16 m) Ringfort, Drumsna, County Leitrim Haley observed how The presence and death of a christian missionary during these events at Mohill is recorded. The conversion to Christianity and subsequent veneration of Manchan of Mohill (d. 538) as saint by the local populace is notable. This parish is named \\"Mohill-Manchan\\" to this day. Hanly reported a great surge in ringfort- building after the plague of 545 AD, as the populace on the boundary of devastated regions, Airg√≠alla and Mohill (barony), sought security from mysterious and widespread death, riving, cattle-raids, enslavement, and worse. These forts (called Raths) were entrenchments the Irish built about their houses. Numerous remains of these forts are visible around ancient barony of Mohill.

Coppuck Welby (pen name, Amelia; nickname, \\"Minstrel-girl\\"; February 3, 1819 - May 3, 1852) was a 19th-century American fugitive poet. In 1837, under the pen-name \\"Amelia,\\" she contributed a number of poems to the Louisville \\"Journal,\\" acquiring a reputation as a notable poet. She published in 1844 a small volume of poems, which quickly passed through several editions. It was republished in 1850, in New York City, in enlarged form, with illustrations by Robert Walter Weir. Though many of her poems were on the subject of death, including \\"The Bereaved\\", \\"The Dying Girl\\", \\"The Dying Mother\\", \\"The First Death of the Household\\", \\"The Mournful Heart\\", and \\"Sudden Death\\", she was one of the most popular poets in the South before the Civil War. Early life and education Amelia Ball Coppuck was born in the little town of Saint Michaels, Maryland, February 3, 1819. When she was still quite young, her parents moved to Baltimore. She lived her girlhood in or near this city up to age 15. In 1834 or 1835, the family moved to Kentucky and took up residence, first in Lexington and later in Louisville. In this latter city, Welby's's brief, quiet life was spent. She received a careful education. Career The Minstrel-girl -a nickname she gave herself- began at the age of eighteen to write poetry for the Louisville Journal, then edited by the poet, George D. Prentice, over the signature of \\"Amelia,\\" and kept up her contributions regularly for ten years. Her productions were admired, and she soon became famous. Copied from paper to paper, her fugitive poems caught the fancy of the people of what was then known as the \\"American West,\\" and before long, the great reviewers of the East thought her talent worthy of their respect. Prentice, as well as Rufus Wilmot Griswold, and Edgar Allan Poe were among the critics who praised Welby's light melody and varied fancy, while also pointing out her lack of discipline and lack of originality. Poe was one of her warmest friends. When a volume of her poems appeared in 1844, it quickly passed through several editions, and many of her songs were set to music. In 1845, a small octavo volume of her poems, published in Boston, proved so popular that D. Appleton & Company sought and obtained the right of publication, bringing out fifteen editions within the next fifteen years. There is one poem by Welby ‚Äîperhaps her very best‚Äî that lived in the memory of thousands of a certain generation, though the name of the author was forgotten. It was the good fortune of \\"The Rainbow\\" to inherit a place, with a mere mention of the author, in George Frederick Holmes' Fifth Reader, one of that series of school books so prominent in the South during the last quarter of the 19th century. Boys and girls all admired and loved \\"The Rainbow,\\" and even later, as men and women, fondly repeated the lines, thinking of the poem, not as the production of Welby, but simply as a bright page in the old reader. In 1838, at the age of nineteen, she married George B. Welby, a merchant of Louisville. She died in Louisville, May 3, 1852, the mother of one child, a son, born two months before her death. Style and themes Though she appeared happy with her life in Kentucky, her poetic mood was chiefly that of reminiscence. She began writing poetry at the age of 18, but not of the passionate present or the golden future but rather that of a regretted past. Half of her poems were in this vein. Many times, contrary to the spirit of her theme, she yielded to melancholy. Though \\"Summer Birds\\" furnishes matter for the morning or noontide, after a few cheery verses, she introduces \\"beneath the moon's pale ray\\" and \\"among the tombs\\". Here, as in so many of her poems, sea, sky, and loved ones come out of the past. Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, was her favorite muse. Her prevailing mood being reminiscent, it was attended by sadness and melancholy. She loved the twilight and moonlight, and often spoke of death. Many of her brightest effusions ended with a sigh; and with all this, very consistently, there was a mingling of religious hope and faith. Her poetry lacking wit or humor, it would, at most, find sentiment or fancies uttered in melodious rhythm. Light, varied fancy, tender sentiment, a persistent note of pathos, a prompt and facile rhythm -‚Äî these were the qualities that won for Welby at the beginning a generous welcome. From the 74 pieces included in the fullest edition of her poetry, a varied selection was made, and her ability was evident. A tone of quiet personal confidence, revealed the melancholy that mused upon a happy past. The critics acknowledged her gift, and discerned signs of promise. Had that promise been fulfilled, her songs would have kept much of the popularity they first won. Instead, monotony and dullness took the place of memories and fancies. Her theme, but not her energy, became exhausted, and, conscious of this state, she became sad at heart. Her narrow range of experience with the tendency to self-repetition, the lack of literary discipline with the tendency to diffuseness, these made against her fame in the long run. Welby might have attained high rank among the lyric poets if her skills from the first had been steadily disciplined. But she was unschooled and unguided, as she herself confessed: \\"'Tis with an untaught hand I sweep the chords.\\" Left, therefore, to her own accord, she repeated herself not only from one poem to another, but not infrequently from stanza to stanza. She lacked skill with condensation, and nearly all her pieces showed twice too many words. The early critics warned her against repetition and diffuseness, but she chose not to take heed. The last four years of her life were lived in silence.

Roosevelt's first term was notable for his trust busting, his successful arbitration in and resolution of a 1902 strike of 150,000 Pennsylvania coal miners, his advocacy against lynching, his conservation efforts, and the Panama Canal Treaty. In 1904, Roosevelt easily defeated Bourbon Democrat Alton Parker and won a second term as U.S. President. The nomination fight A 1904 Parker campaign button After his two defeats in 1896 and 1900, former Congressman William Jennings Bryan rejected the idea of a third consecutive run for the White House. Meanwhile, the campaign of early front-runner Maryland Senator Arthur Pue Gorman fizzled out once he announced his opposition to the Panama Canal Treaty (a treaty which was endorsed not only by almost all U.S. Senate Republicans, but also by almost half of all U.S. Senate Democrats). After Gorman's withdrawal, former President Grover Cleveland was discussed as an ideal candidate by the conservative faction of the Democratic Party, but he preferred to remain in retirement and thus refused to run in 1904. In addition, Richard Olney, the Attorney General and Secretary of State in Cleveland's second term, who had run in the previous two elections, also chose not to run. After Bryan, Gorman, Cleveland, and Olney withdrew themselves from consideration, no prominent Democrat emerged to seek the 1904 Democratic presidential nomination. Indeed, this was caused in no small part by the widespread belief that President Roosevelt was almost guaranteed to win a second term in 1904. The Democrats eventually united around Alton Parker, the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, as their 1904 presidential nominee. Parker had been the campaign manager for New York Governor David B. Hill in 1885 and acquired a reputation for fairness, competence, and courtesy as a judge. As a judge, his record contained evidence of deference to legislatures, strict construction, and recognition of labor rights. While he would have preferred to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, he was persuaded to run for President in 1904 by David B. Hill. Parker played well to the Democratic Party's white base by refusing to criticize the lynchings and denial of black suffrage in the South. He argued in a speech before the Georgia Bar Association that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was not originally understood as granting Congress or the Supreme Court the authority to restrict states' rights. In addition, Parker supported the gold standard and tariff reform and opposed an expansionist and imperialist foreign policy. But unlike other pro-gold standard Democrats, he had loyally supported Bryan in 1896 and had not been involved in intraparty skirmishes. While Bryan opposed Parker, he also could not find any prominent candidates to challenge him for the Democratic nomination. While he lacked Bryan's support, newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst ran an energetic campaign for the 1904 Democratic nomination on a Progressive platform. Indeed, Hearst spent $1.4 million of his own money (equivalent to $ million in ) on his campaign. His bid failed because his views were contrary to the general direction of the party that year, other politicians were alienated by his arrogance, and his morals offended many of Bryan's supporters. Thus, Parker was able to win the nomination on the first ballot at the Democratic convention, winning 679 delegates to Hearst's 181. Meanwhile, 80-year-old former West Virginia U.S. Senator Henry Gassaway Davis was selected as Parker's running mate. Campaign Parker and the Democrats campaigned in favor of reduced federal spending (especially on the military), greater funding to improve national waterways, tariff reform, a thorough investigation of public corruption, direct election of U.S. Senators, arbitration of labor disputes, an eight-hour workday for federal employees, and campaign finance reform. They also condemned Republican imperialism in foreign policy, President Roosevelt's unconstitutional \\"executive usurpation\\" of legislative and judicial powers, trade protectionism, and antitrust legislation. In addition, Parker and the Democrats endorsed construction of \\"the Panama Canal speedily, honestly, and economically.\\" To mollify the Silverites in the Democratic Party, a plank endorsing the gold standard was omitted (though Parker personally ran in favor of the gold standard) and, in return, Bryan's plank for a progressive income tax was left out to placate conservatives. Unlike Bryan, who had aggressively campaigned throughout the entire country during the 1896 and 1900 campaigns, Parker ran a front porch campaign from his home in Esopus, New York. Parker received a boost when Bryan endorsed Parker after the convention and belatedly campaigned for him in October. Meanwhile, Hill, who managed Parker's campaign, sure of a landslide defeat in November, announced his retirement from politics in order to save Parker from guilt by association with Hill. Throughout the 1904 campaign, the Democrats raised less than $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ), with more than half of it coming from Virginia tobacco magnate Thomas Fortune Ryan. In the final weeks of the campaign, Parker tried to save his campaign by undertaking a brief speaking tour at the insistence of desperate party leaders, but it was to no avail. Results President Roosevelt defeated Parker by a landslide, beating him 336 to 140 in the Electoral College and 56% to 38% in the national popular vote. It was the largest popular margin of victory in American history until the 1920 presidential election. Parker won only the 11 states of the former Confederacy and two border states, Kentucky and Maryland (with the latter by just 53 votes). Meanwhile, Roosevelt carried three border states (Delaware, Missouri, and West Virginia) and the nation's 29 other states. Plus, to make things even more humiliating for Parker, Roosevelt might have won some Southern states if the votes of blacks had not have been suppressed there. In addition, Roosevelt's coattails allowed the Republican Party to win a majority of over 100 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time ever.

Harris was born on a farm in Seville, Ohio. Annual Report of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society, published by the Minnesota State Horticultural Society, volume v. 20, 1892, at 394 His father died in 1844, and 18-year-old John was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. At age 21 Harris enlisted in the Army infantry, and participated in the war with Mexico.Donna Christoph Huegel, Stealing the Mississippi River, Joel Lovstad Publishing, 2013, pp. 23-28. Harris' health was poor in 1848 when the war ended, so he traveled to Wisconsin in hopes of finding a healthy climate. Still in poor health in 1851, Harris settled in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and in 1856 moved across the Mississippi River to La Crescent, Minnesota. In La Crescent, Harris established Sunny Side Garden orchard, a 40-acre (16.2 ha) plot with apple, pear, plum, and cherry trees, along with other small fruits. Harris planted thousands of apple trees and hundreds of varieties. ‚ÄúA full half of which were complete and total failures,‚Äù he said. Harris was almost wiped out of the apple propagating business twice, in the winters of 1872-73 and 1884-85. Annual Report of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society, 1892, p. 395. Harris planted apple tree starts sent from other states and then planted the seeds of apples which those trees bore before cold Minnesota winters set in. When the trees bore apples, Harris took the hardiest and replanted. He continued this selective planting to produce apple trees that could survive the Minnesota winter climate. His technique relied on the fact that trees grown from seed live longer than grafted trees or cutting grown trees; they are more vigorous and grow slightly larger. They are also stronger and hardier, and more likely to survive frosts. \\"The Difference Between Seedling, Grafted and Cutting Grown Fruit Trees\\" Harris was a founding member of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society, in 1866.

Telomerase and Telomere Biology  Norrback has performed research into the roles of telomerase activity and telomere length regulation in immune cells and its malignant counterparts.Norrback KF, Dahlenborg K, Carlsson R, Roos G. Telomerase activity in normal B lymphocytes and non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas.

He has worked on potential roles of telomerase activity and telomere length for the inflammatory process and for immunological memory which both are dependent on immune cell proliferation. More recently, he has been involved in evaluating the biomarker value of telomere length with respect to structural and functional measures of the brain, particularly increased stress. His work he has contributed to the body of research which supports considering telomere length as a biomarker of increased levels of chronic stress, as well as containing information pertaining to the proliferative history and future proliferative potential of cells.  Stress and Stress-Dysregulation  Norrback also works on the causes and effects of stress and stress- dysregulation in the general population as well as in affective disorders, which are believed to be stress-related conditions. The research has provided additional support for the condition denoted hypocortisolism, which is characterized by a long-term lowering of the cortisol levels, believed to be induced through an increased stress load.Fries E, Hesse J, Hellhammer J, Hellhammer DH (2005), A new view on hypocortisolism. Psychoneuroendocrinology 30:1010-1016Heim C, Ehlert U, Hellhammer DH (2000), The potential role of hypocortisolism in the pathophysiology of stress-related bodily disorders. Psychoneuroendocrinology 25:1-35 Norrback‚Äôs research has shown that there exist significant associations between hypocortisolism and affective disorders, accelerated cellular aging, psychosomatic conditions, pain and inflammatory symptoms and markers of inflammation.  Psychosomatics  Norrback‚Äôs research in this area has mainly concerned the functional gastrointestinal condition irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but also spans different functional gastrointestinal symptoms as well as pain conditions and pain symptoms. He has tried to address the potential roles of stress- and mood-dysregulation for the etiology, expression and progression of pain and intestinal symptoms as well as conditions. The studies supported that both pain and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as conditions are significantly associated with affective disorders, depressive symptoms and hypocortisolism. The research hence shows support for both stress- and mood-dysregulation as being involved in intestinal and pain symptoms as well as conditions.

Commanding an army some 10,000 men strong, Naja was soundly defeated by Tzimiskes, who continued to march through the Jazira unopposed, even going on to capture Samosata and defeat al- Dawla himself in battle. In 960, in an attempt to abuse the absence of a Byzantine presence in the east, following their assault on Crete, al-Dawla sent Naja to assault the Armenian fort of Turnƒ´q, where he won a victory against the commander of Hanzit, Patrikios Michael.

It is the iron in hemoglobin specifically that gives blood its red color. The actual color ranges from crimson to a dark brown-blood depending on how oxygenated the blood is, and may have a slightly orange hue. Deoxygenated blood, which circulates closer to the body's surface and which is therefore generally more likely to be seen than oxygenated blood, issues from bodily veins in a dark red state, but quickly oxygenates upon exposure to air, turning a brighter shade of red. This happens more quickly with smaller volumes of blood such as a pinprick and less quickly from cuts or punctures that cause greater blood flows such as a puncture in the basilic vein: all blood collected during a phlebotomy procedure is deoxygenated blood, and it does not usually have a chance to become oxygenated upon leaving the body. Arterial blood, which is already oxygenated, is also already a brighter shade of red‚Äî this is the blood see from a pulsating neck, arm, or leg wound, and it does not change color upon exposure to air. The color \\"blood red\\", therefore, covers both these states: the darker deoxygenated color and the brighter oxygenated one. Also, dried blood often has a darker, rust-colored quality: all dried blood has been oxygenated and then desiccated, causing the cells within it to die. This blood is often darker than either shade of red that can be seen in fresh blood. In the RGB color spectrum blood red often consists only of the color red, with no green or blue component; in the CYMK color model blood red has no cyan, and consists only of magenta and yellow with a small amount of black.

The name Xericeps comes from the - meaning dry, referencing the Sahara Desert, in which the pterosaur was first found, and the from capere, meaning \\"to catch\\" - alluding to the creature's forceps-like beak. Description Xericeps is a medium-sized edentulous (toothless) pterosaur, likely closely related to Alanqa. The term 'medium-sized', in the context of pterosaurs, is generally used to describe pterosaurs with a wingspan of 3‚Äì8 metres, and it is likely that Xericeps was nearer the lower end of this range. The holotype specimen is a partial anterior lower jaw, likely broken off right anterior to where the mandibular rami diverged. The jaw is upturned, with the occluding surface curved in lateral view. On the dorsal surface of the mandibular symphysis are a pair of ridges, similar to those seen in Alanqa and Argentinadraco. Discovery and naming The holotype specimen - FSAC-KK-10700 was discovered by local mine workers at Aferdou N'Chaft, a small mesa near the oasis village of Hassi el Begaa in the Errachidia Province in south eastern Morocco on the Algerian border, and consists only of the pterosaur's fragmented jaws. The specimen was purchased directly at the mine site by British palaeontologist David M. Martill in January 2017, and thus it is possible to confidently establish its precise locality and stratigraphic horizon. It is believed that Xericeps lived in the mid-Cretaceous period around the Albian-Cenomanian ages (93.9-113.0 Ma). The holotype specimen's species epithet - \\"curvirostris\\" - comes from the Latin curvus, meaning \\"curved\\" and rostrum meaning snout, or muzzle. This is due to the specimen's noticeably upward-curved beak.

The story takes place in a fictional port city called Malacia, which is an alternate history version of a Renaissance city-state. It tells the story of a poor young actor named Perian de Chirolo who hopes to change his station in life so he can marry a wealthy merchant's daughter. While Malacia is considered a near-utopia, the happiness in the city belies the authoritarian rule of the powerful Supreme Council, which uses fear to prevent progress. Plot The Malacia Tapestry is a novel about Perian de Chirolo, a poor young man who is both a rogue and rarely-working actor, in the imaginary city of Malacia, which resembles Renaissance Venice. De Chirolo lives in a humble attic, cadges meals and drinks in taverns, seeks love affairs with many women, and mingles with artists, astrologers, magicians, and nobility in the bustling port town. As the story opens, De Chirolo enjoys his free time with his young friend Guy de Lambert, who is also an actor. The pair pass their days drinking, jesting, and having affairs with women. Malacia has a legendary curse that it can never progress or change, which is enforced by a powerful Supreme Council, which also eliminates heretics and other freethinkers. The craftsman Otto Bengtsohn, though, defies the anti-progress edicts and invents a type of early photography. Bengtsohn uses the camera to make slides of a play, which is funded by the powerful and wealthy Andrus Hoytola. De Chirolo falls in love with Hoytola's daughter, Armida, who is acting in the play. De Chirolo starts a secret love affair with the wealthy Armida, but she tells him they cannot marry unless he achieves enough in to make an acceptable mate. Despite De Chirolo's professions of love to Armida, and their secret plan to marry, De Chirolo has sexual encounters with a number of women. De Chirolo starts to fall in love, and decides to cease his womanizing. As De Chirolo works with the other participants in the play, he meets working-class apprentices who call for progress and changes in society, which is against the law in Malacia. As De Chirolo tries to rise in Malacian society, he feels frustrated at his lack of progress in being accepted by the nobles. When Andrus Hoytola invites de Chirolo to join the annual hunt for \\"ancestral animals\\" (rare examples of the almost-extinct dinosaurs), de Chirolo is pleased to mingle with nobles and slay a seven-ton Devil-Jaw. However, de Chirolo's rise in Malacian society unravels when Andrus Hoytola learns that Bengtsohn is a Progressive who hopes that his zahnoscope slides can be used to foment a revolution against the ruling class. As the elder Hoytola suspects that de Chirolo is in league with Bengtsohn, de Chirolo ends up banished from society and Bengtsohn is killed. As the story ends, Bengtsohn's fellow Progressives try to recruit de Chirolo to join their plans for a class revolution.

Play within story The novel has a fictional play within the story, Prince Mendicula: The Joyous Tragedy of the Prince and Patricia and General Gerald and Jemina. This play, written by Bengtsohn, is the work which the actors are portraying in the photo-play slides. In the play, the revolutionary-minded Bonihatch (Bengtsohn's young apprentice), plays the Prince; Armida plays his wife, the Princess Patricia; Perian plays General Gerald; and the young, poor seamstress Letitia Zlatorog plays Lady Jemina. The events in the play end up being paralleled by the events in the story (albeit with some changes of people), as Perian is in love with Armida in the story, while also trying to unsuccessfully seduce Letitia, and Perian encourages his best friend Guy to befriend Armida. Plot In the fictional play, Prince Mendicula is a powerful prince who has just conquered the kingdom of Gorica, which lies in ruins as a result of his attack. The Prince was aided in this military conquest by his General Gerald, a noble, rich friend. The Prince's wife is the beautiful Princess Patricia. General Gerald has no wife as the play starts, but he hopes to marry a woman from the conquered city, the Lady Jemina. As the Prince tours the captured city, he becomes entranced with a dark-haired woman who he meets at the inn he is staying in, and he makes drunken advances on her, which she rebuffs; unbeknownst to the Prince, the object of his affections was Lady Jemina. During the time that the Prince is exploring Gorica, he worries that Patricia may have been unfaithful with General Gerald, so he rushes back, but he finds them asleep in separate rooms. Patricia smells the liquor on the Prince's breath, and draws away from his embrace. Her coolness plants a seed of anxiety in the Prince's mind regarding Patricia and the General. After struggling with his doubts, the Prince urges Patricia and the General to enjoy their friendship. When the Prince leaves to establish his rule in Gorica, the General takes Patricia to balls and opera shows. Patricia becomes less warm towards the Prince, which makes the Prince feel guilty for his attempted seduction of the dark-haired woman at the inn. The Prince begins to obsess over the dark-haired woman, seeing her at the inn and talking with her all night. When the Prince returns home in the early hours of the morning, he finds Patricia and the General together, walking in the garden, which they claim was a coincidental early arising. The General tells the Prince that he wants the Prince to meet his unnamed bride-to-be soon (which we know to be Lady Jemina). The General praises the Prince for his enlightened attitude towards the General's relationship with Patricia and for the Prince's seeming lack of jealousy. The Prince accuses Patricia of a sexual relationship with the General, a suspicious attitude which only serves to push her more into the General's arms. Meanwhile, the Prince happens to encounter the dark-haired woman, who is upset that her husband-to-be is consorting with another woman. The Prince consoles the dark-haired woman and holds her, which leads to sexual intercourse. The next day is the dark-haired woman's wedding day, so when she awakes, she feels she has betrayed the General, and says that she must die by suicide to end her dishonour. The Prince finds it a strange coincidence that the dark-haired woman's wedding is on the same day as General Gerald's wedding. When the Prince tells the dark-haired woman about his friend General Gerald's impending wedding, the dark-haired woman, Lady Jemina, is distraught even more. When the Prince realizes that his lover is General Gerald's bride-to-be, the Prince tells Lady Jemina that Patricia has been spotless in her virtue. The Prince goes to Patricia and tells her he will cease looking at other women, and begs her forgiveness. Patricia is cool towards him and says she takes his guilt as and admission of having taken a lover. Patricia gets remote and haughty, and she tells the Prince that despite his repentance, it is too late, and that she is enjoying her affair with Gerald too much. The Prince is shocked at their affair, but Patricia insists the Prince must have known, as he encouraged them to spend time together. Patricia expresses scorn for the Prince, and even when he gets angry, she is only amused, and tells him that she is not attracted to him because the Prince is not frivolous and superficial enough, traits she has come to find relaxing and appealing. When General Gerald enters, the Prince calls him out as a vile betrayer, and the Prince draws his sword. The General draws his sword, and they duel. The General is wounded, and falls back. The Prince hesitates from delivering the death blow, when suddenly a messenger runs in. The Lady Jemina has been found dead by suicide, dressed in her bridal gown. The Prince is stricken by grief, and falls back. Seeing his opportunity, the General leaps up and stabs the Prince, who gives a last look at Princess Patricia, before dying on her bed.

History There seems to be no record of canoeing on the rivers of Southern Africa before the 1930s. By the 1930s, canoe trips were made on rivers like the Orange River and the Vaal River, with the first canoe race on record being made on the Vaal River in 1939. In 1951 the inaugural Dusi Canoe Marathon, was held, the South African Canoe Federation (SACF) was then established in 1956 to govern the sport of canoe racing.History and status quo of river paddling in Southern Africa, cellierskrugger.com, accessed 18 July 2016. Around the 1960s, kayaks made of fibreglass were introduced, and the sport started expanding. During the same period, Willem van Riet began several river races, beginning with a solo descent of the Orange River: he navigated from Aliwal North westwards to the sea at Oranjemund within 36 days. He then made subsequent trips with descents of the Limpopo River, the Sabie River and later, alongside with his friend Gordon Rowe, the Cunene River. In the 1970s, plastic kayaks made their appearance, creating a revolution in kayaking. The understanding of white-water hydraulics grew very fast and waterfalls were being run safely. Commercial river-running also appeared on the scene, with Graeme Addison involved in organising trips for clients using kayaks and rafts, prior to his creation of South Africa‚Äôs first commercial operator ‚ÄúThe River Men‚Äù in 1983. Economic focus later changed in favour of rafting. Graeme Addison in addition, started the Southern African Rivers‚Äô Association (SARA).

Several hundred participants gathered, along with a larger group of counter- protesters who organized the Portland Stands United Against Hate Rally outside City Hall. Police worked to keep the groups separate and closed neighboring Chapman Square where anti-fascist demonstrators had gathered. Officers clashed with this particular group of demonstrators, and fourteen people were arrested. Many weapons were confiscated, but there were no reported injuries. Background Mayor Ted Wheeler asked organizers to cancel the rally, and his attempt to revoke the permit was unsuccessful. The Trump Free Speech Rally was held one week after the May 26 train attack, when a man fatally stabbed two people and injured a third after he was confronted for shouting what were described as racist and anti-Muslim slurs at two teenage girls on a MAX Light Rail. According to KGW, the suspect in the stabbings was at a demonstration similar to the Trump Free Speech Rally in April, when his bat was confiscated and he fought with counter-protesters. Mayor Ted Wheeler and families of the victims asked organizers to cancel the Trump Free Speech Rally, which was scheduled prior to the attack and they said might have potential to \\"exacerbate an already difficult situation\\". Organizer Joey Gibson of the conservative group Patriot Prayer sympathized and said he hoped the event would be \\"a positive experience\\". The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon's legal director said not allowing the rally to continue would have been unconstitutional. Wheeler's attempt to revoke the permit was unsuccessful. Banners with \\"ominous messages regarding the rally\\" were displayed across Interstate 5 overpasses during the night before the scheduled event. The Portland Police Bureau, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security all planned to have officers patrolling in Portland, and TriMet warned about possible disturbances to public transport. The reverend of Portland's United Church of Christ released a statement before the rally, in which she said, \\"We build our hope and our stamina for justice by showing up.\\" Description Counter-protesters at the Portland Stands United Against Hate Rally outside Portland City Hall Riot police keeping opposing groups separated The Trump Free Speech Rally was organized by Patriot Prayer and held on June 4 in downtown Portland's Terry Schrunk Plaza, a federally-controlled property across from Portland City Hall. The event was scheduled to begin at 2pm, and counter-protesters were expected to start arriving a couple hours earlier. Several hundred Trump supporters gathered, as did a larger group of counter-protesters organized by immigrant, labor rights, and religious groups, and other local activists, who convened at the Portland Stands United Against Hate Rally (PSUAHR) outside City Hall. Gibson held a moment of silence to commemorate the two men who died from the train attack and asked attendees to avoid violence. He also said the rally's purpose was to \\"wake up the liberty movement\\", and assured attendees they could be conservative in Portland. Participants displayed banners supporting Trump and chanted \\"U.S.A.\\" The Trump Free Speech Rally reportedly \\"grew tense at times but remained mostly peaceful\\". Police officers, some outfitted for riot control, worked to keep the opposing groups separated. PSUAHR participants reportedly held signs that read \\"Black Lives Matter\\" and \\"our city is greater than hate\\", and chanted \\"go home, fascists\\" and \\"love, not hate\\". By late afternoon, police closed neighboring Chapman Square, in the Plaza Blocks, where a separate group of anti-fascist protesters had gathered. These demonstrators reportedly threw balloons filled with an \\"unknown, foul-smelling liquid\\", bricks, and rocks at officers, who responded by firing \\"impact weapons and chemical munitions\\" (pepper-spray projectiles and stun grenades) to disperse the crowd. Police also moved agitators through a checkpoint to be identified and photographed before being released. Several people, including journalists, were detained. Fourteen of the activists at Chapman Square were arrested, and officers confiscated a variety of weapons, including brass knuckles, bricks, clubs, a hunting knife, homemade shields, a slingshot, sticks, and roadside flares. Police confirmed no crimes were committed by Trump Free Speech and Portland Stands United Against Hate rallies. There were no reported injuries. Reactions The mayor's official request for the federal government to revoke the permit, and a statement from his official Twitter account that hate speech was not protected by the First Amendment, came under fire from many directions in the Portland area and beyond. The ACLU immediately tweeted back that \\"The government cannot revoke or deny a permit based on the viewpoint of the demonstrators. Period.\\", and said on the Oregon chapter's website that the government may not \\"pick and choose how to apply constitutional rights\\" and had engaged in \\"viewpoint discrimination\\". Conservative commentators and bloggers lambasted the mayor with words like \\"blatant hypocrisy\\", \\"obviously pretextual\\", \\"[Portland's] reputation as one of America's most enlightened cities is undeserved\\", and \\"because...Trump\\". The International Socialist Organization wrote that \\"Calls from politicians to put limitations on speech, like the attempt made by Portland mayor Ted Wheeler to get the federal government to revoke the alt-right's permit for the June 4 rally, only serve to further embolden the right and plant the seeds for future crackdowns on the left\\". A Daily Emerald commentator wrote \\"Mayor Wheeler doesn't seem to understand the First Amendment very well\\".

Statue of Jakk≈ç at the shrine History The shrine was founded in 716 CE by Prince Go Yak'gwang (È´òËã•ÂÖâ) of the Goguryeo kingdom of Korea. The Prince was dispatched to Japan to garner support for the Goruryeo Kingdom following an invasion by Silla and Tang dynasty China, but ended up settling in Japan, along with approximately 1,800 other Koreans. Japanese emperor entitled prince Yakgwang as state king position and the people governed the territory allocated until about 13C. Following the annexation of Korea by Japan, the Koma Shrine was used as a symbol by Japanese government officials, including Governor-General of Korea Jir≈ç Minami, for the assimilation and unification of the Korean and Japanese people. In 1934 the Koma Jinja Hosan-kai was founded in order to preserve and restore the shrine, headed by then-Minister of Colonial Affairs Hideo Kodama. Koma Shrine maintained cultural relevance after World War II, and it was written about by prominent Japanese authors such as Eiji Yoshikawa and Ango Sakaguchi. The shrine has more recently been fashioned as a symbol of Japanese-Korean friendship, and is endorsed by the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Tourism Approximately 300,000 tourists visit the shrine annually. Religious function The shrine deifies a Prince Go Yak'gwang (È´òËã•ÂÖâ) of the Koma clan (later known as Genbu Jakk≈ç (ÁéÑÊ≠¶Ëã•ÂÖâ)) who arrived in Japan fleeing political unrest in Korea. Yakgwang reportedly introduced the cultivation of silkworms and mulberry, leading to his deification as Koma Myojin following his death. Its priests are believed to be descendants of the Koma family. The shrine is currently presided over by Koma Fumiyasu, whom according to the Koma-shi keizu genealogical scroll is a sixty-second generation direct descendant of Jakk≈ç.

The region has been the site of new oil and gas related explorations prospect since 2016 though discoveries and surveys have been carried out in the region since 2005 in blocks 17/08 and 16/05. History and development Since early 2000, exploration for oil had been well underway in the Tarim basin region where the Wushi sag and Wensu uplift are located. Research by the Petro China institute for oil exploration had found that the compression anticlines that had formed during the late Himalayan tectonic movement had made the Wushi sag a favorable site for petroleum accumulation. In 2010, CNOOC started to auction oil blocks in the Wushi basin to national as well as international companies when a total of thirteen oil blocks were auctioned for joint development. Block 23/07 lying in the Wushi Sag and partly on Qixi Massif of Beibuwan Basin was auctioned in 2010 to foreign companies who wanted to develop it jointly with CNOOC. This was the first batch of open blocks in China being auctioned to foreign companies. In 2011, Block 23/08 lying in the western part of the Wushi sag in a depth of 15 to 30m and covering an area of 1,210 square kilometers was auctioned. By then, Two wells had already been drilled in this block. As further exploration was undertaken in the region, the first commercial discovery of Wushi 17-2 was made in Wushi Sag in the Western part of South China Sea. In 2014, CNOOC made a further appraisal of Wushi 17-2 which was declared \\"mid-sized oil and gas structure\\". In 2016, CNOOC and the Zhanjiang government allocated 63 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) for projects around Zhanjiang during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016‚Äì20). This includes the Wushi 17-2 oil field in Wushi Sag, Wushi oil field. The Wushi oil field project is the first oilfield under Zhanjiang's administration and also Guangdong's first offshore oil and gas field in shallow waters. Phase 1 of the technical proposal passed review in February 2016 and the environmental impact assessment received the national government's approval in 2017. Zhanjiang city and Wushi oil field are expected to be part of China's Belt and Road Initiative and is expected to provide clean energy to the residents of Guangdong. Though traditionally, oil companies assign code names to offshore prospects early in the exploration effort to help ensure secrecy, Wushi oil field was named by the holding companies CNOOC and COOEC in relation to its location as well as a reference to Chinese culture and aspirations.  Oil wells in Wushi oil field Wushi oil field and oil blocks in the vicinity Block 23/07 Location: Wushi Sag and partly on Qixi Massif of Beibuwan Basin Depth of water: 18m to 40m Area: 1649 km2.

Block 23/10 Developed by CNOOC in co-operation with UK based Cairn Energy under a Production Sharing Contract. the 2,945 km2 region of Block 23/10 lies in the shallow waters of the Wushi Sag area in the eastern Beibu Gulf. The contract is a standard seven-year, three-phase contract consisting of a work program of 2,000 km of seismic acquisition and one wildcat required in the first phase. Seismic recording commenced in 1996, and was followed by drilling in the region in 1997. The Eocene Liushagang Formation provides the source and reservoir in the area. This tract contains the WU 16-1 discovery that was drilled by the French company Total in the early 1980s, but which was not developed at that time, since it was considered sub-commercial. Location The oil field is located in the South China sea, 100 miles from Zhanjiang, a provincial level city in the Southern part of Guangdong province, South China, Close to Nansha,Hainan. China state owned oil exploration company COOEC is the operator of the oil field and principal developer of the oil field with large scale support from the state owned parent company CNOOC. This is the first oil field off China which will be developed along with the local municipality (in this case, the municipal government of Zhanjiang). Zhanjiang city also has one of the largest oil and gas fabrication shipyards of CNOOC Engineering in China and this is expected to support the requirements of the Wushi oil field. Geological target Due for commencing operations in 2017-2018, the oil field is expected to have an initial output of 1 mtpa according to the Zhanjiang municipality and Zhanjiang offshore petroleum taxation bureau. Its reserves are expected to last for twenty years after production commences. Exploration, Oil blocks and entities The Wushi oil field consists of a number of oil blocks, ranging in area from a few square kilometres up to a few thousand square kilometres. Each block itself consists of a number of oil wells, developed by the entities operating each block.

He achieved the rank of Commandant of this colonial paramilitary force from 1861 to 1864. Bligh is probably best known for an incident in Maryborough, where he shot a number of Aboriginal Australians along the main street and into the adjoining Mary River. After retiring from the Native Police, Bligh became a police magistrate in the towns of Gayndah and Gympie. Early life John O'Connell Bligh was born in 1834 in Buckinghamshire, England. His parents, Richard and Elizabeth Bligh, were 3rd cousins. As Elizabeth was the third child of Vice Admiral William Bligh of the mutiny on the Bounty fame, John was therefore a grandchild of this well known former Governor of New South Wales. Bligh emigrated to Australia probably around 1850 and lived with his brother Richard John Bligh who had been Commissioner for Crown Lands and head of the Border Police at Warialda since 1847. John was appointed Registrar of the Small Debts Court at Warialda in 1852. Lieutenant in Native Police Bligh was appointed by the New South Wales Government to the position of sub-Lieutenant in the Native Police on 7 April 1853. He was nineteen years old. Bligh seems to have been posted to the Wide Bay region on a regular basis early on in his career. Capture of John 'Gilburri' Fahy He captured a runaway convict named John 'Gilburri' Fahy who had been living with the local Kabi Kabi for over twelve years. In order to arrest Gilburri, Bligh and his troopers handcuffed all the \\"station blacks\\" at Barambah pastoral station around a large gum tree to prevent him from receiving any information that the Native Police were nearby. Fahy was sent to Cockatoo Island prison but was soon assigned to be an interpreter on the exploratory journey of A.C. Gregory. Further Native Police operations In 1854 and 1855, Bligh was transferred to the 8th Division of the Native Police based at the Yabba barracks in the Conondale Range and at Maryborough. The funding of the Native Police at this stage was uncertain and Bligh had trouble with equipment supplies and the mutinous conduct of some of his Aboriginal troopers. Corporal Donald threatened to hit and handcuff him. Ten days later, Bligh reported that Donald died of dysentery. During this period, he pursued a group of Aboriginal people who had committed \\"depredations\\" in the Mary Valley to the coast and massacred them at Teewah Beach. In October 1855, Bligh was sent to the Clarence River area to take charge of the section there as a 2nd Lieutenant. In June 1857, he was appointed to 1st Lieutenant of the Native Police by Commandant Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset. Bligh was stationed mostly in the Wide Bay-Burnett region or on missions involving the recruitment of troopers for the force around the Clarence River districts. In 1859, he was involved in dispersing Aboriginals attending the Bunya festival in the Conondale Range. The Aboriginals fled to nearby Manumbar where the proprietor noticed that \\"the fear of Bligh acts like a hangman's whip\\" over them. The Governor General of New South Wales appointed John O'Connell Bligh of the Native Police to be a Magistrate for New South Wales on 30 August 1858. Maryborough incident In early 1860, Bligh and his troopers, then stationed at Coopers Plain barracks just to the south-west of Maryborough, chased a number of Aboriginals into the town. In broad daylight and in front of the citizens of Maryborough, these Aboriginals were shot down. Several were killed and an unknown number were wounded. At one stage, Bligh requisitioned a boat in order to shoot two Aboriginals who had fled into the Mary River. A meeting was held in the courthouse to collect money for a gift of appreciation to give to Bligh. At a ceremony later organised by the high profile Maryborough people, Bligh was given a ceremonial sword as a reward for his actions. However, his actions divided the town, with the Maryborough Chronicle describing it as \\"one of the most disgraceful acts ever perpetrated by any community, a blot so foul and deep-stained as will leave on this otherwise fair portion of God‚Äôs earth the brand of eternal infamy\\". The Moreton Bay Courier listed the names of individual Aborigines who had been killed, including Darkey (who was shot down in the street and later roasted) and Young Snatchem (who was driven into the river before Bligh \\"shot the defenceless, tired, unresisting wretch, in the back\\"). On 8 July 1861 Lieut John O'Connell Bligh was examined regarding the above incident by the Select Committee on the Native Police Force and the Condition of the Aborigines generally. The Select Committee also questioned other witnesses regarding Bligh's actions in the same incident. The Select Committee asked his opinion of suggested restructure or disbandment of the Force. Commandant of the Native Police After the retirement of E.N.V. Morisset, John O'Connell Bligh was appointed Commandant of the Native Police in July 1861. His first major duty as Commandant involved organising the severe reprisals for the Cullin-la-ringo massacre where, in October 1861, Aboriginals around the Nogoa River killed nineteen settlers. Bligh travelled to the area and personally oversaw the operations. Colonists in the Nogoa region such as Charles Boydell Dutton described how these operations consisted of orders to Native Police officers to \\"disperse blacks wherever they found them.\\" Bligh himself dispersed members of peaceful tribes working for the colonists and galloped his horse over an Aboriginal woman causing her extensive injuries. Bligh was the commanding officer of the force as the British expanded into the Northern parts of Eastern Australia into areas such as Bowen, Peak Downs and Mackay. The Native Police under Bligh were instrumental in enforcing colonial rule over the Aboriginals in these areas. For much of the time Bligh administered the force from the barracks at Murrays Lagoon near Rockhampton. It was here in late 1863 that he received a kick to the face from a horse that caused severe facial and head injuries. Police Magistrate The reorganisation of the Queensland Police force in early 1864 saw the position of Commandant of the Native Police abolished and the force came under the direct auspices of the new Queensland Police Commissioner, David Thompson Seymour. Bligh was retired from the force and took up a police magistrate position at Gayndah. While in this position, Bligh was involved in a controversy that led to his temporary suspension. A local vagrant by the name of Tim Shea who presented ill to the police station was arrested and sentenced by Bligh to six months jail. Mr Shea died while being transported on an open dray to Maryborough, with multiple bruisings and his tongue bitten through later being observed on his body. Bligh was to be transferred to Clermont for his actions but his powerful family connections in Brisbane prevented this. He later transferred to the gold mining towns of Gympie and Kilkivan. Death and legacy Bligh remained as a police magistrate in Gympie until his death in 1880 at the relatively young age of 46. He married and had several children. As a result of the kick to the face from the horse in Rockhampton, Bligh lost the sight in one eye and had chronic insomnia issues. He died of an overdose of chloral hydrate at his home in Gympie. Bligh Street in Gympie is likely to have been named after him and given both Gympie and the site of the Yabba Native Police barracks are nearby, the Bligh Street in Kilkivan is also very likely to have been named in his honour.

He served as the candidate of both the Democrats and the Liberal Republicans (a breakaway party that split off from the Republican Party due to its members' dislike of the corruption of the Republicans and the Republicans' Reconstruction policies), in the 1872 election. In the run-up to the 1872 United States presidential election, major changes occurred in the United States. Specifically, the 15th Amendment gave African-Americans the right to vote for the first time, while the government cracked down on the Ku Klux Klan. In addition, the economy was still in good shape and President Ulysses S. Grant's corruption scandals for the most part were still not public knowledge. With this background, the incumbent U.S. President was able to decisively defeat Greeley. The Liberal Republican nomination fight A portrait of Horace Greeley in the 1860s Thomas Nast cartoon for the 1872 campaign alleging that Greeley was contradicting his earlier positions. The fight for the presidential nomination of the Liberal Republican Party was heavily contested in 1872. While U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Davis was the initial front-runner for the Liberal Republican nomination, his support weakened after he was relentlessly criticized and attacked in various newspapers. Thus, former United States Minister to the United Kingdom (and son of U.S. President John Quincy Adams) Charles Francis Adams, Sr. was able to open a lead at the 1872 Liberal Republican National Convention with 205 delegates. After Missouri Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown, another 1872 Liberal Republican candidate, dropped out of the race and endorsed New York Tribune editor and former Congressman Horace Greeley, Greeley was able to overtake Adams on the second ballot, with Greeley getting 245 delegates to Adams's 243. After a surge by U.S. Senator Lyman Trumbull on the third ballot, Greeley was able to retake the lead with 334 delegates on the sixth ballot. Later on, Greeley ended up winning the 1872 Liberal Republican nomination with 482 delegates to Adams's 187. Meanwhile, Gratz Brown was chosen by the delegates at this convention as Greeley's running mate. The Greeley nomination was extremely surprising to U.S. Senator Carl Schurz, a prominent Liberal Republican, as well as to the other supporters of Charles Francis Adams. Both the press and the public were also surprised by the Greeley nomination due to the fact that the largely free-trade Liberal Republicans had chosen a staunch protectionist as their presidential nominee. Moreover, Greeley had no political or government experience, was known for his eccentric, erratic persona and support of a wide variety of fringe ideas from vegetarianism to spiritualism, and had left a massive paper trail of controversial and sometimes contradictory public statements which the press and his political enemies could exploit. After Greeley and Gratz Brown were nominated by the Liberal Republicans, the Democrats also nominated the Greeley-Brown ticket as its own nominees for the 1872 U.S. presidential election due to their belief that they could not win the U.S. Presidency without the support of anti-Grant Liberal Republicans. Both Liberal Republicans and Democrats thought that, by sharing the same presidential candidate, they would be able to infiltrate and dominate the other party. A group of Democrats dissatisfied with the Greeley nomination called themselves the Straight-Out Democratic Party and held a second nominating convention in Louisville, Kentucky. They nominated Charles O'Conor and John Quincy Adams II as candidates. They received 0.35% of the popular vote and no Electoral College votes. Campaign The 1872 U.S. presidential campaign was filled with dirty attacks and mudslinging on both sides, with Greeley partisans calling Grant a dictator and a drunk, while Grant partisans called Greeley a traitor and a flake. In addition, Grant and the Republicans \\"waved the bloody shirt\\" by associating the Democrats with secession and with the defeated Confederacy. During the campaign, federal officials arrested over 1,000 people under authority of the Reconstruction Enforcement Acts in order to make sure that Republicans, especially Blacks, were not prevented from voting. While President Grant did not actively campaign, Greeley travelled through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana and delivering up to 22 speeches per day for a total of nearly 200. Ultimately, though, Greeley was hurt by the belief that he was saying the wrong things to the wrong audiences during his campaign, and by taking political attacks extremely personally. He also suffered a personal loss during the campaign when his wife fell ill and died in October 1872. To make matters worse, his running mate, Gratz Brown, was an embarrassment who attended campaign events and delivered speeches while intoxicated (he fainted before a gathering in New York City, and at a campaign picnic, Brown was so drunk he was seen slicing up and buttering a watermelon), forgot party policies, and generally made errors and misstatements. Results Grant defeated Greeley in the election by a landslide, winning 31 out of 37 states in capturing the Electoral College by 286 to 66,Grant also won Arkansas and Louisiana, but their 14 electoral votes were rejected due to various irregularities and allegations of electoral fraud. and won the national popular vote by 55.6% to 43.8%. Grant's winning percentage was the highest between 1828 and 1904, while Greeley's losing percentage was the lowest between 1848 and 1904. However, Grant's performance was much weaker in the South, where his (and the Republicans') appeal was primarily limited to Black men. Due to exhaustion and demoralization, Horace Greeley himself died several weeks after the 1872 election.

He is the founder and managing partner of the design practice Somatic Collaborative. Correa is currently the Vincent and Eleanor Shea Professor and the Chair of Architecture at the University of Virginia School of Architecture. Previously, he served as faculty at Harvard Graduate School of Design as an assistant professor (2008-2012), associate professor (2012‚Äì2018), and as director of the Master of Architecture in Urban Design (MAUD) program (2009-2018). Correa's writing, research, and design work have been widely published and exhibited. Early life and career Correa was born and raised in Quito, Ecuador. In 1995 he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana where he attended Tulane University for a Bachelor of Architecture. Shortly thereafter, he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts where he attended Harvard University and graduated with a Master of Architecture in Urban Design degree from the Graduate School of Design. Since then, Correa has split his time between Cambridge, New York, and Quito. Academic career Correa's academic work focuses on expanding the role of design in creating spatial synthesis across different scales and geographies of the built environment. While at Harvard, Correa worked with sponsors from the public and private sectors to develop multiple lines of research looking at specific contemporary case studies of fast-paced urbanization. The publication of several significant applied research and design monographs related specifically to this work include the urban impact study for the new underground metro currently under construction in Quito (A Line in the Andes; Harvard University Graduate School of Design, 2012), a study of the current state of mobility infrastructure for Mexico City (Mexico City: Beyond Geometry and Geography: AR+D, 2015) and, most recently, a comprehensive study and proposal for the transformation of inner-city postindustrial land in S√£o Paulo, Brazil to new, centrally-located affordable housing districts (S√£o Paulo: A Graphic Biography; University of Texas Press 2018). Correa addresses students at Harvard Graduate School of Design Correa is also the author of Beyond the City: Resource Extraction Urbanism in South America (University of Texas Press, 2016). The book ties together a series of architectural models of often-overlooked sites outside the traditional South American city. Implementing the term ‚Äúresource extraction urbanism,‚Äù Correa critically assesses five key urban and territorial projects in South America in the last century, providing a historical account of resource extraction in developing the region and re-framing the role of the \\"architect-planner\\" in relation to current regional initiatives underway throughout continent.  Design Practice  Gravatai Housing Project, Somatic Collaborative Perched House in Autumn, Somatic Collaborative In 2006, Correa co-founded the Somatic Collaborative (with Anthony Acciavatti), which he still manages today. Working across disciplines and spatial scales, Somatic Collaborative operates at the confluence of Architecture, Landscape, Urbanism, and Infrastructure. Through Somatic, Correa has developed projects for various organizations, both from the public and private sectors, throughout the world. Most recently Somatic has worked in Kassel, Monterrey, Porto Alegre, Quito, S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Seoul. Somatic Collaborative conceives design as a mediator across multiple scales of the build environment. Some of Correa's most recent design projects include the Perched House and the Neapolitan Residential and Co-Working Complex. Sited in the outskirts of Kassel (Germany), the Perched House is an experimental home designed as part of the Ways of Life program for Documenta 14, that investigates new relationships between domestic space, remote working, and new connections to nature. The Neapolitan Complex in Porto Alegre, Brazil examines how affordable housing can become the epicenter of new mixed-use and mixed income districts in South American intermediate scale cities.

Austin. University of Texas Press. 2018. In S√£o Paulo: A Graphic Biography, Correa presents a comprehensive portrait of Brazil's largest city, narrating its fast-paced growth through archival material, photography, analytical drawings, and text. Additional essays from scholars in fields such as landscape architecture, ecology, governance, and public health offer a series of interdisciplinary perspectives on the city's history and development. Beyond the City: Resource Extraction Urbanism in South America (2017) Within the context of South America's recent push towards transnational integration, Correa analyzes the spatial imperatives brought by the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America. Providing much-needed historical contextualization to IIRSA's agenda, Beyond the City ties together a series of spatial models and offers a survey of regional strategies in five case studies of often overlooked sites built outside the traditional South American urban constructs. Implementing the term ‚Äúresource extraction urbanism,‚Äù Correa takes us from Brazil's nineteenth- century regional capital city of Belo Horizonte to the experimental, circular, ‚Äútemporary‚Äù city of Vila Piloto in Tr√™s Lagoas. In Chile, he surveys the mining town of Mar√≠a Elena. In Venezuela, he explores petrochemical encampments at Judibana and El Tablazo, as well as new industrial frontiers at Ciudad Guayana. The result is both a cautionary tale, bringing to light a history of societies that were ‚Äúinscribed‚Äù and administered, and a perceptive examination of the agency of architecture and urban planning in shaping South American lives. Mexico City: Between Geometry and Geography (2014) (with Carlos Garciavelez Alfaro) Utilizing visual representation in the form of photography, maps, archival material, and various other analytical diagrams, Correa traces the historic urbanization and evolution of Mexico City. Specifically this book aims to examine the relationship between past public works projects and the modern day urban fabric of the city. A Line in the Andes (2012) Following one year of investigation, Correa depicts a visual and analytical representation of the urban transformations in Quito, Ecuador that resulted from the city's implementation of its first underground metro line. Cities: X Lines-A New Lens for the Urbanistic Project (2006) (with Joan Busquets) Busquets and Correa outline the specific methods, tools, and lenses that current designers are utilizing as they shape and develop today's cities. Intertwining methods with case studies throughout the world, the authors paints a vivid picture of how design frameworks have shifted over the past 30 years.

The route is proposed to run mostly along existing tracks. These rights-of way were originally constructed in the 1870s and 1880s by the Southern Pacific Railroad, which founded all the cities along the corridor when it first laid tracks, with the exception of the older city of Visalia. The tracks are currently owned by the Union Pacific Railroad, with the San Joaquin Valley Railroad operating on nearly all of the corridor, except for a 1-mile (1.6 km) portion of the Union Pacific mainline connecting the eastern and western branches near Goshen. The easternmost of the route between Strathmore and Porterville were abandoned and the tracks pulled up, but the land was purchased by the City of Porterville to preserve the right- of-way.  History  Initial studies of a passenger rail service were conducted in the mid-1990s. A Cross Valley Rail Corridor Joint Powers Authority was founded, which raised $14.2 million from government and private sources to resurface the rail corridor in 2002‚Äì2003 to accommodate heavier freight traffic, and keep the line in operation in preparation for a passenger rail service. A 2004 study revisited passenger rail plans. California High- Speed Rail offered $600,000 in funding for a station planning grant including the Cross Valley Corridor, providing that the City of Hanford (which is in Kings County) and Tulare County each provided $100,000 in matching funds. Hanford and Kings County have strongly opposed the high-speed rail project, while Visalia and Tulare County have supported it. In August 2015, the Hanford City Council voted not to spend the funds, but Tulare County officials proceeded with the planning process. In April 2017, the Tulare County Association of Governments released an existing conditions report. In June 2018, it approved a final plan.

Location The ruins are located near Amb Sharef village, on Sakesar mountain in the Soon Valley of Pakistan. The ruins form the westernmost ruins of a string of Hindu temples in the Salt Range mountains that includes the Katas Raj Temples and Tilla Jogian monastic complex. Architecture The main temple is roughly 15 to 20 metres tall, and built out of brick and mortar on a square plinth. It is regarded as the \\"loftiest\\" of temples built by the Hindu Shahi empire. The temple ruins have three stories, with stairwells leading to inner ambulatories. The temple is decorated with Kashmiri style motifs on its exterior, including a cusped niche. The structure of the main temple, differs from Kashmiri temples which typically have pointed tops.

The program, launched in 1973 at a time the country was experiencing a rice supply shortage, led the Philippines to attain self-sufficiency in 1975-1976, and export rice to its neighboring Asian countries in 1977-1978. Though critics said that it left poor farmers in debt and the program was used as a vehicle of political patronage. Etymology ‚ÄúMasagana‚Äù is a Filipino term for ‚Äúbountiful‚Äù while 99 refers to the number of sacks of rice yielded per hectare of land in every harvest season.  Concept development  Masagana 99 was conceived by the administration of then Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos as way to cope with a nationwide rice shortage arising from the various natural disasters and pest inverstations in 1972. Launched on May 21, 1973, its goal was to promote Philippine rice self-sufficiency by raising the Philippines' average palay crop yield from 40 cavans per hectare to 99 cavans per hectare. The program planned to achieve this by pushing farmers to use newly-developed technologies including high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds, low- cost fertilizer, and herbicides. The program included a supervised credit scheme, which was supposed to provide farmers with the funds needed to pay for the program's technology package. The Central Bank designed subsidized rediscounting facilities for public and private credit institutions throughout the country, encouraging them to give loans to farmers without collateral or other usual borrowing requirements.  Initial success  The program achieved initial success by encouraging farmers to plant new ‚ÄúMiracle Rice‚Äù (IR8) variety of rice which the International Rice Research Institute had been developing since 1962, during the administration of President Carlos P. Garcia. The program was launched at the time the country was experiencing a shortage of supply on rice and was credited for the launching of the Philippine Green Revolution in 1973 which allowed the country to export rice to other Asian countries. The highlights of its short-lived success happened when the Philippines finally attained self-sufficiency in 1975-1976, and was able to export rice to its neighbors in Asia in 1977-1978. But costly subsidies and failure of many farmers-borrowers to repay the loans led to the program benefiting only 3.7% of the country's small rice farmers by 1980.  Problems with the credit scheme  Economists generally acknowledge Masagana 99 to have failed because the supervised credit scheme it offered to farmers proved unsustainable. The program is said to have catered to rich landowners and has been criticized for leaving poor farmers in debt and for having become a vehicle of political patronage.  Negative environmental impact  Aside from the problems of its credit scheme, however, Masagana also had a negative impact on the environment and on traditional agricultural methods. Masagana 99‚Äôs package of technological interventions in the form of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and other chemicals imported from other countries. This resulted in the devastation of indigenous plants and animals, and the eradication of certain pest species only led to the dominance of other pests. For example, Masagana 99 was responsible for convincing the majority of the Philippines' irrigated rice farmers to adopt the use of chemical fertilizers. It also led the Bureau of Plant Industry to focus on chemical fertilizers to eliminate pests such as the rice stemborer because pesticides were cheaper - abandoning a pre-existing Integrated Pest Management approach which used Trichogramma to control stemborer populations. Discontinuation  National Scientist and former University of the Philippines President Emil Q. Javier notes that by 1980, \\"Masagana 99 ceased to be of consequence as only 3.7 percent of the small rice farmers were able to borrow.\\" By 1981, the program's problems were apparent enough that Southeast Asian news outlets noted that Masagana 99 and its aquaculture equivalent, Biyayang Dagat, were lacking in funds due to low loan repayment rates. By 1984, the Marcos administration shifted its focus away from Masagana 99 and towards a new program, the Intensified Rice Production Program (IRPP), which like Masagana 99 succeeded in temporarily increasing rice production, but ultimately left its beneficiary-farmers in debt.  Aftermath  According to Carlos Dominguez III who was the agriculture secretary under the administration of President Corazon Aquino, the successor of Marcos, from 1987 to 1989, the program caused about 800 rural banks to go bankrupt, never boosted rice production sufficiently for the country to be able to export rice, and left poor farmers in debt, because the program was used as a vehicle of political patronage. Proposed revival President Rodrigo Duterte expressed his interest to revive the program on October 2016. The plan met opposition from MASIPAG, a group of farmers and scientists, saying that revival of the program will bring back issues such as debt, replacement of traditional varieties with newer ones, and the promotion of pesticide use which they say will harm animals, farmers and crops and insisted that only large firms benefited from the program. The Department of Agriculture notes that the old variety used in the Masagana 99 program is already phaseout and the Masagana 99 can use newer varieties of rice and insists that environmentally friendly pesticides will be promoted under the potentially revived Masagana 99.

During that period, the area was transformed and restored several times. Recent excavations have revealed many remains, such as a 10th-century temple which was built by a minister to Yasovarman I, was probably considered to be this minister's residence. Most of the royal palace buildings were constructed by using perishable materials because they would have been non-religious in nature. Plan East gopura of the Royal Palace The rectangular place of the royal palace was surrounded by a 5 meters high laterite wall with 246 meters along the north-south axis and 585 meters along the east-west axis, covering an area of more than 14 hectares. Five sandstone gopuras with steps served as the entrance to the palace. Two gupuras are located on the south, other two are on the north, the largest one faces to the east and aligned with the Elephant Terrace and Victory Gate. The first group of buildings, built by king Suryavarman I, was surrounded by a moat on the east. The ground inside the palace compound is 1.2 meters higher than outside that necessitating a double course of stone on the exterior of the entrances and in some places, the ground has been raised even higher. The Large Pond Large Pond with carving sandstone embankment The 5625 square meters pond, probably built by king Jayavarman VIII, is faced with sandstone around its circumference. 13 tiers of steps descend 5.32 meters to the laterite paving. A wall was built on the south and to a lesser extent on the west which probably retain the embankment that extends to the pond from Phimeanakas. Dominating the pond on top of the wall is a paved terrace. The walls are completely carved with bas-reliefs the lower sections show marine lives, heads of cow or horse, There are two rows of princes and naga princesses in the middle part which is similar to Terrace of the Leper King that located above winged figures, male and female guardian figures. The East Pond The East Pond An 800 square meters sandstone pond, situated near the east gopura, was probably part of the first palace. Terrace and the West Pond A small pond and low terrace are located to the west of the Large Pond that both connected by a laterite wall to the west northern gopura of the royal palace. The walls are carved with fascinating bas-reliefs of a procession of people, elephants and horses above a frieze of hamsas. Terrace to the east The cruciform terrace with round column and overhanging top was typically built in the 16th century AD. Four small sanctuaries to the east The four small sanctuaries were constructed in the early phase, which evidenced by their floor level. They are opening to the west and parallel to the southeast of the second part of the Royal Palace.Ancient Angkor guide book by Micheal Freeman and Claude Jacques, p. 111-113, pub: 2003.

These are The Cybercrimes Act, 2015, The Statistics Act, 2013, The Media Services Act, 2015 and The Access to Information Act, 2015. The Government of the Republic of Tanzania on one side claims that the four Acts were highly needed to facilitate access to information and control the media sector. On the other, political analysts, activists and everyday people have criticized the Acts, predicting that they will negatively affect freedom of the media and, eventually, citizens' freedom of speech. The Acts give Tanzania's Minister responsible for information the power to ban any media which may seems to report, publish, print or broadcast information contrary to the code of conducts or threaten peace in the state.  Brief history  The Media Services Act, 2016, was enacted in 2016 by the parliament of the united republic of Tanzania on 5 November 2016 and signed by President John Pombe Magufuli two weeks later. The Act replaced the then restrictive newspaper Act of 1976. The expectation of many people was that the Act would become an updated media law adhering to international conventions like the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR), the East African Community Treaty and other sources which affect then liberty of citizens to access information. Instead, the Acts appears to many to act to deprive certain civil constitutional rights, including freedom of expression and freedom of access to information.  Reaction from the press  The Media Council of Tanzania (MCT), Legal and Human Right Centre (LHRC), and Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC) on 11 January 2017 filed a petition at the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) challenging the newly passed Media Service Act, 2016. The petition, supported by a team of lawyers from MCT, LHRC and THRDC claims that the Act deprives civil liberties and access to information rights guaranteed under Article 18, subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Constitution of Tanzania, respectively addressing: * freedom of opinion and to speech * the right to seek, receive and/or disseminate information, regardless of national boundaries; * the freedom to communicate and protection from interference * the right to be informed at all times of various important events of life and activities of the people and also of issues of importance to the society.

He is known as one of the pioneers of the Soviet Arctic aviation.  Life   Early years  Otto Kalvitsa was born as a carpenter's son in the village of Kontiolahti, Northern Karelia. After finishing the elementary school, Kalvitsa entered the industrial school in Helsinki on his father's expense. Kalvitsa also took some drawing lessons in the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1903, Kalvitsa left the industrial school and started working for Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works to finance his studies. In 1907‚Äì1912, Kalvitsa sailed on the ships of the Finland Steamship Company and finally finished his studies in 1913, graduating as a steam engine operator. The next four years, Kalvitsa worked in the steam liners of the lake P√§ij√§nne. He was active in the labour movement since the 1905 general strike, and also participated the strike supporting the 1906 Sveaborg Rebellion.  Finnish Civil War  As the Finnish Civil War broke out in January 1918, Kalvitsa lived in Lahti. He joined the local Red Guard and was sent to Heinola, where he first served in gun repair and was later named as the \\"fleet commissar\\". In the late April, Kalvitsa joined fleeing Reds and finally ended up in the coastal town of Kotka. On 4 May, he was evacuated to Saint Petersburg by a steam ship. After a month in the Buy refugee camp in the Kostroma Governorate, Kalvitsa and three other Reds returned to Saint Petersburg. They were appointed by the Finnish revolutionaries Eino Rahja and Evert Eloranta to sneak into Finland as spies. After crossing the border on 2 August, they were soon captured by Finnish Whites in Antrea, where one of the men was killed in a gunfight. Kalvitsa was sentenced for 10 years in prison, but in January 1919, he managed to escape from the forced labour camp in Vyborg and fled to Russia.  Pilot in the Soviet Union  Back in Saint Petersburg, Kalvitsa joined the Petrograd Red Officer School but was soon transferred to the Naval School of Aviation in Samara. Graduating in 1920, Kalvitsa became one of the nine Finnish pilots who served the Baltic Fleet Air Force in the Russian Civil War. In March 1921, he took part on the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion and also fought against the Finnish Whites in the 1921‚Äì1922 East Karelian uprising. In May 1923, Kalvitsa was badly injured in a plane crash, but returned to service. In August 1925, Kalvitsa made his first arctic flight as he flew with the Russian pilot Boris Chudnovsky from Leningrad via Arkhangelsk to Novaya Zemlya. The mission was to survey ship routes for the Northeast passage. Kalvitsa and Chudnovsky were particularly exploring the waters of Matochkin Strait between the Severny and Yuzhny Islands of Novaya Zemlya. In June 1926, Kalvitsa participated Georgy Ushakov's expedition to the Wrangel Island in order to survey the island for a location for the first Soviet colony. In 1927, Kalvitsa left the Navy and joined the civil aviation organization Dobrolyot, the precursor of Aeroflot. He flew the route between Ulan-Ude and the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator. A year later, Kalvitsa was transferred to Irkutsk where he earned the nickname ‚Ä≥Wolf of the North‚Ä≥, due to his skillful flying in extreme weather conditions. In the summer of 1929, Kalvitsa explored the Arctic Sea coastline in the Chukchi Peninsula and Yakutia. The three-week journey also included a visit to the newly established colony in the Wrangel Island. Kalvitsa flew a German Junkers F 13 with the Hungarian revolutionary Franz Leonhardt as his co-pilot. The journey finally ended on 19 August as Kalvitsa landed the severely damaged plane in Bulun.  Death  On 5 March 1930, Kalvitsa was ordered to fly medical supplies to Bulun for Cheka officers who were injured in an occurring uprising. Two days later, Kalvitsa took off from Yakutsk with the intention of flying to Bulan via Zhigansk, but in a heavy snow storm his Junkers W 33 crashed to the ice of the Lena River near the village of Sangar. Kalvitsa, Franz Leonhardt and the Russian radio-operator S. S. Karchevsky died.  Commemoration  Kalvitsa and Leonhardt were buried in the mass grave of the revolutionary heroes in the Jerusalem Cemetery in Irkutsk. Their memorial is composed of an aircraft propeller attached to a standing stone. Another memorial was later erected near the crash site. The village of Kalvitsa in the Sakha Republic and the bay Zaliv Kalvitsa in Novaya Zemlya are named after him.  Memoir  Kalvitsa's memoir J√§√§merilent√§j√§n p√§iv√§kirjasta (‚Ä≥From the Diary of an Arctic Pilot‚Ä≥) was published posthumously in 1930. The book was edited by Finnish socialists Santeri M√§kel√§ and Ragnar Rusko. It was also published in the United States by Finnish-American socialists.

Purser is openly lesbian and came out during her teens.  Same-sex marriage  Around 2009 Purser began approaching her tribal leaders to ask them about recognizing same-sex marriage, making her the first to do so within her tribe. She did not seek assistance for her efforts, as she worried that others were unconcerned with same-sex marriage rights and would not be interested in helping her. In March 2011 Purser attended a tribal meeting where approximately 300 of her fellow tribes people were in attendance to again ask for recognition of same-sex marriage. Her request was met with an \\"enthusiastic yes\\", which led to tribe officials unanimously voting to legally recognize same-sex marriage in August 2011. For her efforts Purser was recognized by Seattle mayor Michael McGinn during the city's annual Human Rights day celebration on February 16, 2012.

He held the national title in 1970 and 1971 and won a silver medal at the 1971 Pan American Games. Born in Wilmington and raised in New Castle, Delaware, Skinner was trained as metalsmith and welder, as were his father and grandfather. In January 1957, aged 17, he quit high school and enlisted to the U.S. Navy; he completed his service in the spring of 1961. After that he played semi-professional football with the Wilmington Clippers and trained in boxing and weightlifting before changing to javelin throw. By March 1968 he quit his welding job to attend the University of Tennessee and graduated in industrial education. In 1971, his refusal to shave his mustache led to him being removed from the University of Tennessee Track Team, an infamous incident covered by Sports Illustrated. He continued his javelin career throwing for the New York Athletic Club. In 1971 he captained the U.S. team at the Pan American Games. Later that year he received an elbow injury and was stabbed while trying to stop a bar fight in Knoxville; as a result he missed the 1972 Summer Olympics. Skinner married in late 1962 and had a daughter. He divorced in 1970. The same year his younger brother, Jimmy, was killed in a car accident after returning from Vietnam. He remarried in 1971 and had two more daughters. After retiring from competitions, Skinner lived in Kentucky and worked for John Deere company. He was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and to the Delaware Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1994. He was posthumously inducted into the Tennessee Athletics Hall of Fame in 2016 as part of the first class honoring male athletes.

He is sometimes called De Podio, but that is only the Latin form of his diocese Le Puy (Aniciensis). Early authors, Ciaconius and Fantoni, placed his birth at the Chateau du Puy, in the Limousin, based on this mistake, as though Le Puy (de Podio) was a reference to his birthplace. L. Cardella Memorie de' Cardinali II (Roma 1793), p. 361. was born in the commune of Saint-Symphorien-sur-Coise, in the Department of Rhone, once in the ancient County of Forez. He died in Avignon on 9 November 1415. He was Bishop of Lodeve and then Bishop of Le Puy. He was a cardinal of the Avignon Obedience during the Great Western Schism, and was promoted to the Bishopric of Tusculum (Frascati). His principal work, however, was as a courtier and administrator at Avignon, and as a papal diplomat. Early career In his Testament, Pierre Girard mentions a brother, Jean Terralli, and several consanguinei: Jean Girard (who has children), John's sister Margarita, Lucia the wife of Jean Arnaudi, and Joannes Polerii. Pierre began his education as a choir boy in the Choir School of the Cathedral of Saint Jean in Lyon, called the Man√©canterie ('morning chant').Eremita peregrinus, \\"French Cathedrals, XXVI: Lyon,\\" Pierre was Archdeacon of Bourges by 9 February 1373. He held the Licenciate in Civil and Canon Law by 1374. He was a cleric of the Apostolic Chamber (the papal finance ministry), and Canon and Provost of Marseille from 1374 to 1382.Eubel, p. 310. Alban√©s & Chevalier, pp. 808‚Äì816. On 8 June 1381, Girard was named papal Nuncio to France (Apostolicae Sedis in lingua gallicana nuncio) by Pope Clement VII \\"for certain difficult business for the Pope and the Holy Roman Church\\", and was particularly ordered to investigate the situation in the diocese of Nantes, where the diocese was being administered by procurators appointed by the bishop on the alleged grounds that he was aged and \\"lacking in discretion\\".Alban√©s & Chevalier, pp. 811-812. There were disorders everywhere, caused by the Great Western Schism, and Pope Clement was obviously interested in supporting bishops who supported him, against obstinate supporters of Urban VI. By 4 September 1381 Pierre was being addressed by the Pope as electus Lodovensis. He had received a major promotion for his work. Episcopate Girard was granted his bulls as Bishop of Lod√®ve by Pope Clement VII on 17 October 1382. On 29 October he was found in Paris, with the Bishops of Paris and Geneva, sent to punish a Collector of the Apostolic Chamber who had committed various crimes.Eubel, p. 310. Alban√©s & Chevalier, p. 812-813. Girard was transferred to the diocese of Le Puy on 17 July 1385 by Pope Clement VII.Alban√©s & Chevalier, p. 813-814. He was installed by proxy on 30 July, and in person on 22 September 1388.Baluze, p. 1387. Obviously Girard was not a residential bishop; Le Puy was only a benefice. He is on record as being in Avignon on 10 October 1387, when he dined with Jean Fabri, Bishop of Chartres, the diarist. He held the See until his promotion to the Cardinalate in 1390. Eubel, pp. 91-92. In 1386, two of Urban VI's cardinals, Pileus de Prata and Galeozzo de Petramala, withdrew from Urban's allegiance and joined that of Clement VII. Clement sent Bishop Girard to bring the two cardinals a proper red hat, and on 13 June 1387 Cardinal de Prata was named Cardinal Priest of Santa Prisca, while Cardinal de Petramalari was named Cardinal Deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro on 5 May 1388.Eubel, p. 23; Sainte-Marthe, Gallia Christiana II, p. 729. On 15 November 1388, Girard was present at the deathbed of Cardinal Pierre de Cros, as he made his Last Will and Testament.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana II, p. 729. Baluze, p. Cardinalate Pierre Girard was created a cardinal by Pope Clement VII on 17 October 1390, and assigned the titular church of San Pietro in Vincoli on 21 December 1390.Eubel, p. 28, no. 32. Alban√©s & Chevalier, p. 816. Clement VII died in Avignon on 16 September 1394. When the news reached Paris on 23 September, the University of Paris immediately sent a delegation to the King. They argued that the moment had arrived to heal the schism, and they requested the King to intervene with the Cardinals to postpone the election of a new pope. Time was needed for multiple consultations as to the best way forward, and the King should even consult with the pope of the Roman Obedience, Boniface IX, in the hope of coming to some sort of agreement. The King consulted with his royal Council, and decided to send Renaud de Roye to Avignon immediately with a letter from the King. The Conclave, however, began on September 26, though before the Conclave was locked up, a fast messenger from the King brought a royal letter. The Cardinals, believing that they knew what was in the message, decided not to open it until the Conclave was over. They thereby preserved their canonical rights. Cardinal Girard participated in the Conclave of 1394, which then went forward. Cardinal Pedro de Luna was elected on 28 September 1394, and took the name Benedict XIII. The opportunity to heal the schism had been missed.Valois III (1902), p. 1-7. J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1394; retrieved: 2017-09-23. Cardinal Girard was named Suburbicarian Bishop of Tusculum (Frascati) in 1402 by Pope Benedict XIII.Eubel, p. 39. He was also named Major Penitentiary.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana II, p. 729. He still held the office when he signed his Testament at Bologna in November 1410 under John XXIII.From July 1409 until January 1412 he appears to have had a colleague, Cardinal Antonio Caetani, who had been Patriarch of Aquileia and Bishop of Palestrlna in the Roman Obedience. When Caetani joined the Council of Pisa and the Obedience of Alexander V, he had to give up the Bishopric of Palestrina, which already belonged to Cardinal Guy de Malsec, the Dean of the Sacred College. In compensation, Alexander V named him Bishop of Porto and Santa Rufina and Major Penitentiary. Before he joined the Council of Pisa he had been given the faculties by Gregory XII of the Roman Obedience to correct and reform the Minores Poenitentiarii, and apparently the appointment was continued. Cardinal Caetani died on 2 or 11 January 1412. Ciaconius II, p. 709. Eubel, p. 26, no. 5. Repudiation of Benedict XIII On 2 February 1395 a meeting of the French clergy was convened in the royal palace in Paris in the name of King Charles VI, for the purpose of tendering advice to the King as to the means to end the Great Western Schism, which had been going on for nearly seventeen years, with no signs of resolution. Over 150 letters of summons were issued. The consensus of the meeting was that the \\"Way of Cession\\" (resignation of both contenders and election of a new pope for both Obediences) was the most efficient solution. The three royal dukes, Berri, Bourbon and Anjou, who had in fact inspired the meeting, were sent to lead a delegation to discuss the matter with Benedict XIII in Avignon. Conferences with the Pope took place at the end of June in Villeneuve, where the Pope was staying at the time, but the Pope finally withdrew from personal attendance, saying it was beneath the papal dignity to negotiate in public.Valois, III (1901), pp. 27‚Äì43. The three dukes then held a consultation with the Cardinals in the Duke de Bourbon's residence in Avignon, and each cardinal was asked in turn for his opinion on the various proposals to resolve the schism. Cardinal Girard pronounced in favor of the \\"Way of Cession\\", stating that Clement VII on several occasions had promised that he would resign the papacy to save the Church.Baluze, p. 1377. Collegiate Church at Saint-Symphorien-sur-Coise Cardinal Girard was already working with the French Court and Benedict XIII to maintain cordial relations. On 25 May 1385, in his capacity as Major Penitentiary, he granted faculties to the Bishop of Paris to dispense four couples who wished to marry from the impediment of close relationship to the fourth degree of kinhood. It happened that one such couple in the diocese of Paris were Isabelle, daughter of King Charles VI, and her betrothed, King Richard II of England. Evidently Benedict XIII did not want to be seen to be too closely linked to the French monarchy, and his fertile mind as a former professor of Canon Law saw in the Major Penitentiary a way to do what was necessary without attracting public criticism of being a tool of the King of France.Valois (1901) III, p. 102. On 1 September 1398 at Villeneuve eighteen cardinals, among them Pierre Girard, published the retraction of their obedience to Benedict XIII. A few weeks later, after negotiations with the pontiff, they returned to their obedience.Baluze, p. 1351. Martin de Alpartils, Chronica Actitatorum I (Paderborn 1906) (ed. Ehrle) p. 35. In the list of cardinals, Girard is identified as being Major Penitentiarius. In 1407 Cardinal Girard returned to his birthplace in Saint-Symphorien,His Testament identifies the town as Sanctus Symphorianus Castri. The location of this town was long a matter of controversy. Baluze (1693), p. 1386, already notes that Saint-Saforin d'Ozon between Lyon and Vienne is wrong. There are at least twenty-two communes in modern France called Saint-Symphorien. It is not the Saint-Symphorien-le-Ch√¢teau. Early authors, Ciaconius and Fantoni, placed his birth at the Chateau du Puy, in the Limousin. Cardella Memorie de' Cardinali II (Roma 1793), p. 361. where he built a church and established in it a College of Canons. The church was the recipient of generous benefactions in the Cardinal's Testament.Baluze, p. 1387. Council of Pisa and Conclaves On 29 June 1408, thirteen cardinals (who held the proxies of two additional cardinals) met in the port city of Livorno in Italy, where they prepared a manifesto, in which they pledged themselves to summon a general council of the Church to solve the problem of the Great Western Schism. One of them was Pierre Girard, Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum (Frascati).Valois IV (1902), pp. 13‚Äì14. Agreement of the Cardinals at Livorno, retrieved: 2017-09-19. When the Council finally met on 25 March 1410, Girard was a prominent member of the Council. When the vote was called for on 10 May 1409 in the matter of deposing and anathematizing Benedict XIII and Gregory XII, the vote was nearly unanimous, except for Cardinal Guy de Malsec and Cardinal Niccol√≤ Brancaccio, who asked for more time to consider.Valois IV (1902), p. 99. The sentence was finally read on 5 June. Cardinal Girard was one of the twenty-four cardinals who took part in the Conclave that was held during the Council of Pisa, from 15 June to 26 June 1409. Cardinal Pietro Filargo was elected, and chose the name Alexander V.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1409, retrieved: 2017-09-19. Unfortunately he survived only 10¬Ω months, but during that time, in a gesture intended to heal the wounds of the schism, he issued a papal decree legitimizing all of the cardinals of all the obediences. Cardinal Girard participated in the Conclave of 1410 in Bologna.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1410; retrieved: 2017-09-22. Cardinal Pierre Girard composed his Testament at Bologna in the house of the Servants of Mary on 7 November 1410, the first year of Pope John XXIII. The Notary remarks that the document filled six large folio pages. In addition to Cardinal Niccol√≤ Brancaccio and Jean Allarmet de Brogny one of the executors was a consanguineus of Cardinal Girard, Joannes Polerii, Bachelor of laws and Sacristan of the Cathedral of Saint Paul in London.Fisquet, p. 358. The Testament and its Codicil of 10 November are printed in The testament remarks that at the time he possessed thirty benefices, twenty-six of which were priories.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana II, p. 729. He died in Avignon on 9 November 1415. He was buried at Saint- Symphorien-sur-Coise, in the crypt of the Collegiate Church on the summit of the hill, on the Rue Cardinal Giraud, which the Cardinal had built. This was in accordance with his Last Will and Testament.Duchesne, p. 551.

He is the vice chairman and managing director of Apollo Tyres, India's second-largest tyre manufacturer with annual revenues of over $2.27https://corporate.apollotyres.com/en-in/press- media/news/fy20/?subsection=Announcements billion. He is credited with turning Apollo Tyres from a commercial vehicle-focussed tyre manufacturer in India into a multinational company that now manufactures tyres for commercial and passenger vehicles as well as two-wheeler tyres. Education Kanwar was educated at St. Columba's School, Delhi and thereafter graduated in engineering from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, US. Career Kanwar started his career with a training stint at American Express Bank in New York City. He thereafter returned to India and started Global Finance Ltd, a non- bank financial institution which shut after three years. In 1985 Kanwar became the third generation of his family to join Apollo Tyres, which was launched by his grandfather Raunaq Singh and later taken over by his father Onkar Kanwar. His first position in the company was in the sales team. In 2002, Kanwar took over daily operations from his father. Kanwar is the force behind Apollo's international acquisitions. When the company announced its acquisition of Dunlop Tyres, South Africa in 2006 it simultaneously announced Kanwar's elevation as the company's Managing Director. The company later sold most of its South African operations to Sumitomo Rubber Industries in 2013, retaining one plant in Durban. In 2009, under the aegis of Kanwar, Apollo bought out Vredestein Banden in the Netherlands, thus giving the company a foothold in Europe. Apollo bought Reifencom GmbH in Germany in 2015, giving it access to distribution channels across Europe. After a failed takeover attempt of Cooper Tires in 2013, Kanwar decided to focus on organic growth by investing in new greenfield facilities in Chennai, India and Budapest, Hungary. The Hungary plant was inaugurated in 2017. Personal life In partnership with Amit Burman (vice chairman of Dabur), Kanwar bought an Italian restaurant called Scalini in London in 2014. Kanwar and Burman met during their University days in Pennsylvania and remained friends.

She was ordered by Romania during World War I and laid down in April 1917 at the Schneider Shipyard in Gironde. However, she was requisitioned by French authorities at the end of the year and completed for the French Naval Forces. Upon commissioning in 1921, she became the first French submarine to be completed between 1919 and 1944. Construction and specifications O'Byrne and her two sister ships (Henri Fournier and Louis Dupetit-Thouars) were ordered by the Romanian Government from the Schneider Shipyard in Gironde, being laid down in April 1917. However, Romania was forced out of the war in December 1917, when the construction of the three warships was at an early stage. The three submarines were subsequently completed for the French Navy, with larger bridges and conning towers. O'Byrne was the first to be launched (22 May 1919), followed by Henri Fournier (30 September 1919) and Louis Dupetit-Thouars (12 May 1920). They were completed and commissioned in 1921. Each of the three submarines had a surfaced displacement of 342 tons, measuring 52.4 meters in length, with a beam of 4.7 meters and a draught of 2.7 meters. Power plant consisted of two Schneider diesel engines and two electric motors powering two shafts, resulting in a surfaced top speed of 14 knots. Each vessel had a range of 1,850 nautical miles at 10 knots and a crew of 25. Armament consisted of four 450 mm torpedo tubes and one 47 mm deck gun.Paul E.

History  ex machina is a music project that was founded by Claudio Chiriatti in 1999 in Trier. Tobias Schwerdt has become a second member since 2008. ex machina has distributed its music over the Internet from the very beginning. The debut album ex machina, as well as a few individual pieces, have been released in download only formats in self-distribution. Also the album bewegung / movement produced from 2004 to 2005, was released at various music download web sites in self-distribution. In October 2006, a contract was signed with Friedel Muders for his music label Fuego, since then the music of ex machina has been distributed exclusively via this label. In November 2006 Fuego released the albums bewegung / movement, lichter / lights and warten / waiting. These albums were produced over a period of two years and were released at the same time. The first two albums, ex machina and welttblick, as well as various individual tracks, were no longer distributed. The music on these three albums is purely instrumental and the pieces are adapted to the respective album theme. Accordingly, the opening track sunset / sunset on the album lichter / lights is an attempt to compose a musical version of a sunset. The progress of the track represents the intensification of the resulting colors. ex machina contributed a composition to the art project Music from the Masses initiated by the artist Matthias Fritsch at the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. Afterwards Music from the Masses was shown as a traveling exhibition in different museums. Claudio Chiriatti moved back to his birthplace Clausthal-Zellerfeld from D√ºsseldorf in early 2008. In the same year he got into contact with his old school friend Tobias Schwerdt. Both musicians decided to work together on ex machina. The first album they produced together was line of time and it was released in April 2011 at Fuego. It is the first ex machina album on which all titles are in English language. Furthermore, for the first time there are classic pop songs with vocals included on this album. A further innovation is the participation of a guest musician on line of time. Eva Heuling has sung the lead vocals for three songs. After line of time the album no one was released in April 2013. It is a Concept album that tells the story of a self-proclaimed prophet. According to reviewers the sound of the album is \\"rougher, gloomier\\" than on the previous releases. Critics praised the musical diversity of the album, accordingly, many different genre influences can be heard on the album. It is described as \\"peppered with Kraftwerk character and interwoven with The Cure Sound\\". For the songs no one, eternity and drifting ex machina produced music videos which should lead deeper into the story of the concept album. After the release of no one, ex machina released tracks that were not included on the album, as free downloads at SoundCloud. Following the release of no one the two musicians were working on a live program. They decided to realize a live sequencing concept with their music. Within this concept, Claudio Chiriatti should take over the live sequencing and play individual lines live on a controller. Tobias Schwerdt on the other hand should sing, add effects and live sequencing. To the music, short, visually complementary video clips were projected onto a screen behind the musicians. This live presentation had its premiere in January 2014 at the Kellerclub Clausthal-Zellerfeld.

Career Peter was born into the gens (clan) B≈ë, which originated from Somogy County, as one of the two sons of Stephen, who himself was the son of Ders. His older brother was clergyman Michael, Bishop of Zagreb, then Archbishop of Esztergom. Through their unidentified paternal aunt (a sister of Stephen), Michael and Peter were related to the gens Monoszl√≥ and its influential contemporary members, brothers Egyed, Gregory and Peter. Due to the influence of his cousin, Peter Monoszl√≥, Bishop of Transylvania, Peter B≈ë was appointed Count of the Sz√©kelys by King Andrew III in 1294, at the same time, when Ladislaus K√°n took the office of Voivode of Transylvania, while Michael B≈ë became grand provost of Transylvania. Peter first appeared as count in a royal charter on 29 June 1294, when he was a member of a special delegation, which investigated an atrocity between the citizens of Esztergom, the local chapter and the clergymen of St. Thomas Church. In December 1294, Egyed Monoszl√≥ donated three villages of the Atyina (today Voƒáin, Croatia) lordship to brothers Michael and Peter, entrusting the P√©cs Chapter to contribute his instruction. The land donation was confirmed by Andrew III on 9 January 1295. On 19 February 1299, Peter was still referred to as Count of the Sz√©kelys, when he was present during a possession contract between Master of the treasury Dominic R√°t√≥t and Julius S√°rtv√°nyvecse. According to a non-authentic charter, Peter still held the office in the next year. Ladislaus K√°n took control of the whole of Transylvania after the death of Andrew III in 1301. During the ensuing interregnum, he also usurped the administration of Sz√©kely Land, thus the dignity of Count of the Sz√©kelys remained in vacancy until 1315, when Charles restored royal authority after K√°n's death. Egyed Monoszl√≥ made his first will and testament in 1298, when formally adopted his maternal relatives (cousins) Michael and Peter. Egyed donated Darn√≥c Castle (today Slatinski Drenovac, Croatia) to them, however both Peter and Michael had died before Egyed. Thus, in 1308, Egyed changed his last will and testament, when his son-in-law, Nicholas and his brothers from the Ny√©k branch of the gens Aba were granted Darn√≥c, which confirmed Peter B≈ë's death by that date. According to the above- mentioned non-authentic charter dated 28 October 1300, King Andrew III has given permission Peter B≈ë to hand over Darn√≥c to his wife. It is presumable that the document was forged in favour of Peter's wife (now widow) in the early 14th century, as her husband in fact never owned the estate.

Part of the seventh generation of the Pok√©mon video game series, the games are enhanced versions of Pok√©mon Sun and Pok√©mon Moon from the previous year. Announced in June 2017, they were released worldwide on 17 November 2017. As with previous installments, the games follow the journey of a young Pok√©mon trainer, taking place in the Alola region‚Äîbased on Hawaii. Differences from Sun and Moon include an alternate storyline and new gameplay features, characters, Pok√©mon, and Pok√©mon forms, including new forms of the legendary Pok√©mon Necrozma as version mascots. The games received generally positive reception, with critics praising the additional features included over Sun and Moon, although some criticized it for being too similar for a majority of the story. By the end of 2018, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon had sold over eight million copies worldwide. Gameplay Similar to previous games in the series, Pok√©mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon are role-playing video games with adventure elements. While set in an alternate version of the Alola region, the mechanics and graphics remain largely the same as Pok√©mon Sun and Moon, with the primary differences being its modified storyline now including the Ultra Recon Squad. The player character designs are also different, though they remain customizable. \\"Global Missions\\", where players across the world work towards a collective goal, also make a return. New features Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon introduce new Ultra Beasts: Stakataka, Blacephalon, Poipole and its evolution, Naganadel. In addition, there are new forms for the legendary Pok√©mon Necrozma, dubbed \\"Dusk Mane\\" and \\"Dawn Wings\\" forms, which are achieved by absorbing the legendary Pok√©mon Solgaleo and Lunala, respectively; it is conceptually similar to Black and White Kyurem from Black 2 and White 2 and Lusamine's mutated form from the original Sun and Moon. Also, a new Lycanroc form was added, Dusk Lycanroc. Players can now travel around the Alola region to collect Totem Stickers, which allow the player to receive a Totem-sized variant of a Pok√©mon. Three new activities have been added: Mantine Surf, which allows the player to surf across the region's seas‚Äîit also serves as an alternate way of earning Battle Points; Alola Photo Club, which allows players to take pictures of their player character with Pok√©mon in various poses; and Ultra Warp Ride, which allows the player to travel through varying Ultra Wormholes and encounter Ultra Beasts in their own worlds‚Äîin addition to finding legendary Pok√©mon from every game in the series, up to three times, and an increased chance for shiny Pok√©mon to appear. New Z-Moves are available for multiple Pok√©mon, including Solgaleo, Lunala, Lycanroc, Mimikyu and Necrozma. An upgrade to the Rotom Pok√©dex adds Roto-Loto, which allows the player to use boosts, akin to O-Powers from the previous generation; and Z-Rotom Power, which allows players to use up to two Z-Moves per battle. Plot Setting The games put an emphasis on the legendary Pok√©mon Necrozma which, in these versions, takes Lusamine's place as the primary antagonist of the games. As with Sun and Moon, the games are set in the Alola region which is based on Hawaii. Although largely the same, the new games feature additional buildings and locations in comparison to the first installments. Multiple main characters featured in Sun and Moon, such as Lusamine and her children, return in the game with significant changes. A new group, the Ultra Recon Squad, is introduced with differing characters in the two games. Ultra Megalopolis, a vast city where Necrozma has robbed all of its light sources, is located within Ultra Space and is accessible through the Ultra Wormholes. Another antagonist group, Team Rainbow Rocket, is featured in a post-game story and includes all of the previous antagonist group leaders featured throughout the series, ranging from Giovanni from Pok√©mon Red, Blue and Yellow to Lysandre from Pok√©mon X and Y. Legendary Pok√©mon from previous generations are also included. Story Similar to Sun and Moon, the player character is an eleven-year-old moving to Melemele Island in Alola with their mother. As is tradition, the player has rivals on their journey: Hau, a friendly boy who accompanies the player throughout the story, and Gladion, the estranged son of Lusamine. During their travels in Alola following the region's traditional island challenges, they complete trials which involve battles with powerful Pok√©mon known as Totem Pok√©mon, and encounter numerous groups ‚Äî a villainous one known as Team Skull, led by a man named Guzma; a more charitable one known as the Aether Foundation, led by a woman named Lusamine; and another called the Ultra Recon Squad, who came from a different dimension, the Ultra Megalopolis, where Necrozma has stolen its light. Much of the story revolves around multiple legendary Pok√©mon: a Cosmog, nicknamed Nebby, who eventually evolves into a Solgaleo in Ultra Sun, or Lunala in Ultra Moon; and a Necrozma, who attempts to seize the light from Alola. During the climax, Lusamine uses Nebby to create a wormhole to the Ultra Megalopolis, where she and Guzma attempt to fight Necrozma for the sake of the Ultra Recon Squad. However, they fail and are thrown back into their dimension later on in the story, with Necrozma following them. Necrozma fights Nebby, now a Solgaleo or Lunala, and prevails. Necrozma then absorbs the legendary Pok√©mon, gaining its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings form in the respective version, and unleashes the Ultra Beasts upon Alola before fighting the player. After the player defeats it, Necrozma escapes into the Ultra Megalopolis, taking the world's light with it while the player, with the help of the Ultra Recon Squad, travels on the opposite legendary featured in each game‚ÄîLunala in Ultra Sun or Solgaleo in Ultra Moon‚Äî, through Ultra Space to reach the Ultra Megalopolis. There, the player battles Necrozma, this time in its true form, as Ultra Necrozma, for the fate of the world and to rescue Nebby. The player defeats it once more, bringing light back to Alola. After completing these trials, the player proceeds to battle a newly established Elite Four and later defeats Hau to become Alola's first true Pok√©mon League Champion. In the post-game, the player encounters Team Rainbow Rocket, a dimensionally displaced group based on Team Rocket from Red, Blue, and Yellow. The aforementioned group seizes control of the Aether Foundation's headquarters and takes Lusamine hostage. The player stages a counterattack alongside a reformed Guzma, Lillie, and former Team Plasma leader Colress. Battling through villainous team leaders from the past games‚ÄîMaxie and Archie from Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald; Cyrus from Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, Lysandre from X and Y, and Ghetsis from Black, White, Black 2, and White 2‚Äîthe player finally encounters Giovanni, who leads Team Rainbow Rocket and has a Mewtwo at his disposal. After the player's victory, Giovanni vanishes, wondering \\"what new world shall [he] unleash [his] evil schemes upon\\". The player can then explore the Ultra Wormholes, the worlds of the Ultra Beasts, and catch them with the Beast Balls they have acquired. After catching Necrozma at Mount Lanakila, Colress will appear and give the player the N-Solarizer or N-Lunarizer, allowing Necrozma to fuse or separate from Solgaleo or Lunala respectively. Once the player has caught the Ultra Beasts, the Ultra Recon Squad will tell them to defeat or catch Stakataka in Ultra Moon or Blacephalon in Ultra Sun. Development Shigeru Ohmori, one of the game's producers, stated that Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were worked on by younger staff members while veterans worked on the upcoming Pok√©mon games for the Nintendo Switch, although some more experienced members, such as Shigeki Morimoto were assigned to it. He also stated that Game Freak was treating Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon as the \\"culmination of our work with the 3DS system\\". The development team of 80 was approximately half that of Pok√©mon Sun and Moon despite Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon having a script twice as long as Sun and Moon. In a separate interview, Ohmori also described an idea to develop the Ultra installments formed late during the development of Sun and Moon, with the titles intended to take advantage of the momentum gained by the Pok√©mon series following the massively successful release of the mobile game Pok√©mon Go. Game director Kazumasa Iwao was previously in charge of the battle systems in Sun and Moon. In the post-game, the games include a tribute to former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata, mentioning his role in the development of Pok√©mon Gold and Silver. The games received their first patch in December 2017, fixing several bugs. Promotion and release Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were revealed in a Pok√©mon Direct on 6 June 2017. Initial clerical errors in the Pok√©mon website showed that the games' release date for the Nintendo Switch were \\"TBA\\", although The Pok√©mon Company later clarified that the games were exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS. Similar with its predecessor, the game's files were leaked on to the Internet before their official release, allowing software pirates to play the full game and data miners to find previously unannounced information including a new form for Necrozma, a new Ultra Beast, a new mythical Pok√©mon and more. Less than a week before the game's release, the mobile game Pok√©mon Go released an update which enabled its players to customize their in-game avatars in the style of player characters from Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, marking the first time the app had been used to promote a main series game. Reception Prior to release, both games were among the most highly anticipated titles for the Nintendo 3DS in 2017, according to Nielsen. Critical reception Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. Casey Defreitas in her review for IGN remarked that the games were \\"full of smart improvements\\". Other reviewers made similar points, with Kallie Plagge at GameSpot noting that despite similarities with Sun and Moon, \\"Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon make enough changes to stand apart as the definitive version of the seventh generation games\\". On the other hand, Allegra Frank of Polygon criticized that the aforementioned changes were only present at the end, with the bulk of the gameplay being the same as its predecessor. Sales Following release, the two games sold 1.2 million physical copies‚Äîexcluding digital copies purchased from the Nintendo eShop‚Äîwithin the first three days on sale in Japan. By the end of the year, the two games had sold over 2 million copies in Japan alone, making it the best-selling video game in the country for 2017. Sales from Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon pushed the cumulative sales of the franchise to exceed the 300 million copies sold milestone. According to Amazon, Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were their seventh-best selling video games in 2017‚Äîhowever, they drop to 25th for Ultra Sun and 28th for Ultra Moon if other video game-related products and console variations are accounted for. As of 31 March 2020, the games have sold 8.77 million copies, ranking them as the ninth‚Äìbest selling Nintendo 3DS titles of all time. Awards The games were nominated for \\"People's Choice\\" at the Italian Video Game Awards, and won the \\"Excellence Prize\\" at the Famitsu Awards.

He arrived in Rhodesia in January 1899, choosing to settle in Bulawayo and founding \\"The Bulawayo Observer\\" in August 1902. He acted as editor for this weekly, which reported on political and financial news, until its demise in January 1904. In 1910 he relocated to the vicinity of Mazoe, a village north of Salisbury, and stayed on the farm 'Tatagura' for a number of years. From 1911 to 1914 he served on the Legislative Council as a representative of the Northern Districts. In 1914 he joined the civil service, carrying out the duties of statistician and water registrar in the Department of Agriculture. Some time later he became associated with the Census office and compiled the Report of the director of census dealing with the European census taken on 3 May 1921. Eyles' scientific interests were wide-ranging, as shown by his contributions to the Rhodesia Scientific Association, of which he became a member in its founding year of 1899, and was elected president for 1922/3. At first Eyles collected insects, being particularly fond of the Coleoptera or beetles, a selection of which he presented to the Association's museum in 1900. The following year his interest had been captured by prehistory, so that in March 1901 he wrote a paper on \\"The origin of the native races of South Africa\\", a collation from various philological and anthropological sources - this work was published in the Proceedings (Vol. 2, pp. 30‚Äì42). His next contribution, \\"On a cave with Bushman drawings in the Matopos\\" (Ibid, Vol. 3, pp. 65‚Äì69), was presented in November 1902, and included descriptions of ancient stone artefacts from the cave. Other papers such as \\"The collection of natural history specimens\\" (Ibid, 1903, Vol. 4, pp. 33‚Äì37) and \\"Notes on the habits of a young genet\\" (Ibid, 1907, Vol. 7, pp. 25‚Äì28) reflected his deep interest in natural history. At about this time Eyles found his attention gradually shifting to botany, writing and presenting a paper on \\"Ferns and fern allies of Southern Rhodesia\\" in April 1906. (Proceedings, Vol. 6, pp. 87‚Äì91). The following year he announced that he was compiling a catalogue of Rhodesian plants, to which end he had put together an extensive herbarium. Indeed, for the remainder of his life he concentrated on Rhodesian flora, culminating in the publication of \\"A record of plants collected in Southern Rhodesia\\", issued in the Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa (1916, Vol. 5, pp. 273‚Äì564), laying the foundation for study of the Zimbabwean flora. He also published two papers in the South African Journal of Science: \\"Constituents of the flora of Southern Rhodesia\\" (1920, Vol. 17, pp. 181‚Äì184) and \\"Ecological notes on the flora of Salisbury commonage\\" (1927, Vol. 24, pp. 289‚Äì298).http://www.zimbabweflora.co.zw/speciesdata/utilities/utility-display- records-by-person.php?person_id=21 In 1923 he was appointed Department of Agriculture botanist and mycologist, spending six months at the University of Stellenbosch where he studied mycology and plant pathology under P.A. van der Bijl. Back in Rhodesia he published a list of plant diseases in 1926. The following year the mycological side of his work was transferred to John Collier Frederick Hopkins, while he carried on as the departmental botanist. While working for the Department of Agriculture he edited the Rhodesia Agricultural Journal, producing articles such as \\"Diseases of cotton in Southern Rhodesia\\" (1924) and \\"Some diseases of tobacco in Rhodesia\\" (1924). In 1928 he became curator of the Queen Victoria Memorial Museum and Library in Salisbury. During the period 1901 to 1937 he collected some 9 000 botanical specimens which were lodged in the Government Herbarium and the National Botanic Gardens, with duplicate sets at Kew, the British Museum and the National Herbarium in Pretoria.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa vol.4 His collection of fungi were kept at the Department of Agriculture in Salisbury, and at the Mycological Herbarium at Pretoria.

The plus sign was saved in the same way as in the Plus mobile logo, having the same owner. On July 31, 2014, the name was changed to Polsat News 2 due to a lawsuit filed by Polsat with ITI Neovision, the owner of the nc+ platform. Since ITI Neovision has the plus sign (taken from its main shareholder Canal+) all its own channels, the District Court has decided to secure the suit for the duration of the ongoing process by ordering Polsat to change its name. In November 2014, the Court of Appeal reviewed Polsat's appeal and overturned the previous decision, allowing the channel to be restored to its current name. Polsat has not yet decided on a possible renaming of the channel. In December 2014 the District Court in Warsaw issued a judgment which dismissed the suit nc+ in its entirety, but the verdict is not legally binding. However, the Court has forbidden the platform to use the \\"+\\" symbol in the name of the channel Polsat News+ and the program \\"+ Kultura\\". In addition to the prohibition, the court ordered the TV station falsity to announce that it can not use the + sign in its channels.

Trinity Has Arrived in Eldorado () is a comedic spaghetti western from 1972. It is one of the first of various \\"Trinity\\" films inspired by the earlier They Call Me Trinity and Trinity Is Still My Name. The observation regarding the other Trinity films is attributed to Joe D'Amato. Plot and title  Jonathan Duke, a con man, and his partner Sebastian Carter make a living travelling the country and selling a dubious \\"Elixir of Long Life\\" - a scheme that is in the end exposed by an elderly man. Next, the two try to trick people at poker, but the plan ends badly in a saloon brawl. After these two introductory scenes, the main plot of the film starts. Duke and Carter plan to team up with Ringo Jones and his band to rob the crazy Mexican general Eldorado, who believes he is a god and sits on a golden thrown flanked by two servant girls, of his gold treasure. Duke does so successfully by dazzling Eldorado with magic tricks, then overcoming him in a fencing duel and tying him up. The film's English title notwithstanding, \\"Trinity\\" is the name of a town, not a person, and the Italian title more accurately reflects the film's plot. Cast *Stelvio Rosi as Jonathan Duke III *Gordon Mitchell as Sebastian Carter *Craig Hill as Eldorado *Amerigo Castrighella as Ringo Jones *Daniela Giordano as Juanita Production The film was shot at Gordon Mitchell's western village at Manziana. As to the length of the shoot, D'Amato gives two conflicting statements: In an interview published in print in 1996, D'Amato recalled it had lasted six days, whereas in a video interview conducted in 1998, he said it had taken three days. Diego Spataro, however, stated to \\"Nocturno\\" that it had lasted four and a half days. Spataro also remembered the anecdote that as soon as shooting had closed, D'Amato had said, \\"Tell the cook to throw in the spaghetti\\" (). Directorial credit Sources disagree as to the identity of the film's director. The credited name, Dick Spitfire, is a pseudonym for Diego Spataro, a name that had also been used for an earlier film, Django and Sartana Are Coming... It's the End. In his 1992 book on spaghetti westerns, Thomas Weisser assumes that the name is a pseudonym for director Demofilo Fidani and, consequently, states that Fidani was director for both Django and Go Away!. However, Weisser cites no additional evidence other than the similarity of the two films' treatment of humor with that seen in other Fidani films. Regarding the use of humor, Weisser says the \\"sight gags are humorous at first, but [...] timing is so bad that the joke quickly turns from funny to tedious\\". In an interview published in 1996, Joe D'Amato said that Go Away! was the first film he directed and that he shot it in six days with the help of assistant director Romano Gastaldi. He also acknowledged that the official director's credit went to Spataro, and not to him. In another interview some two years later, D'Amato elaborated on this point, stating that he had not wanted to receive directorial credit because he had feared that, once he had worked as a director, other directors would have been hesitant to hire him as a cinematographer. D'Amato further recalled that Spataro, who had made many spaghetti westerns with Fidani, had plenty of stock footage from those films, and that some of it was used in editing Go Away!. In this latter interview, D'Amato states that the film was shot in three days, not the six-day period stated in the 1996 interview. In his 1999 book on Italian cult films, Marco Giusti cites an interview with Diego Spataro in which Spataro recalled that D'Amato initially had wanted him to act as a puppet (): D'Amato would give him the information he was then to pass on the actors so they would know in which way to act; after 10 minutes, however, D'Amato became aware of the absurdity of the situation and took charge himself. Giusti therefore attributes the direction of the film to D'Amato, and states that Fidani, for whom D'Amato had often worked as a camera operator, was involved as a producer. Regarding the interview with Spataro from which Giusti cites, Giusti indicates the source only as \\"Nocturno\\" - probably referring to the Italian film magazine of that name, but without any indication as to which issue or year he found the interview in. In his book on spaghetti westerns published in 2002, film historian Ulrich Bruckner describes Go Away! as a collaboration between Spataro, Fidani and D'Amato. He credits all three as directors of the film. The motorbike gag One of the film's comic effects is Eldorado's horse, which has motorbike mirrors attached to it. When Eldorado arrives at an oat vendor, he asks him to \\"fill it up with super\\" (). Reception In a contemporaneous review of the film, La R√©vue du Cin√©ma deplored mistakes in chronology, chaotic editing and lack of talent in storytelling, but at the same time recognized its quirky humour. Month of issue and page number are not known. More recently (2002), Ulrich Bruckner found it to be among the better collaborations of D'Amato, Fidani and Spataro. In his 2004 book on Joe D'Amato, Gordiano Lupi thinks that Go Away!, in contrast to the western A Bounty Killer in Trinity which D'Amato is also said to have directed, contains ingenious ideas that to Lupi are the hallmark of D'Amato's involvement. Lupi thinks that the film's best moments are its comic or \\"trashy\\" scenes, whereas he criticizes what he calls the \\"structural\\" parts: lengthy chases, laborious ambushes, endless, predictable shootouts and unrealistic brawls. To Lupi, the film is discontinuous and \\"loses itself\\" towards the end when it seems the director did not known where he wanted to end up. Still, Lupi applauds the last scene in which the Duke puts a hand of five aces on the table, calling it - in the Italian version - a \\"superpokermaggiore\\" (translated: \\"a major superpoker\\").

She claimed to be able to treat drug addiction using electric shocks, something she called \\"neuro- electric therapy\\" (NET). The reputation gained by NET was based on celebrity endorsements, but there is no evidence that it is an effective treatment. - excerpted at Health Libraries in Lincolnshire Online Early life and education Margaret Angus Ingram was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1922. The daughter of Alexander Ingram, she was the youngest of five children. Patterson started medical school at 21 during World War II, and qualified as a member Fellowship of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons when she was 25, the only woman in the group.  Career  Patterson went to India as a medical missionary. While she was in India she met George Patterson in Kalimpong and they married in 1953; the couple were committed Christians. George Patterson had become famous through his involvement with the Dalai Lama, and his reporting on the 1959 Tibetan uprising and the subsequent events in China's annexation of Tibet. For her work establishing and expanding clinics in India she was awarded the MBE in 1961. In 1964, she moved to Hong Kong with her husband, where she was appointed surgeon-in-charge at Tung Wah Hospital. They remained in Hong Kong until 1973. In 1972, other doctors in Hong Kong, H.L. Wen and S.Y.C. Cheung, published their work on electroacupuncture for treatment of addiction. Patterson adopted their method, developing a technique called \\"neuro-electric therapy\\" (NET), replacing the acupuncture needles with electrodes, making this a form of cranial electrotherapy stimulation. On returning to the UK she and her husband collaborated to popularise the technique, which became popular with rock and pop stars. The medical and scientific community was skeptical about the technique. Patterson found herself building clinics with minimal funding, much as she had in India. In 1976, Patterson set up a clinic in Broadhurst Manor, East Sussex, funded by the Robert Stigwood Organisation. Donors misleadingly marketed the clinic as \\"a cure for heroin addiction\\", which it was not. In 1981, funding ran out and she moved the clinic to California. A 1986 article in New Scientist said that the medical establishment viewed Patterson as a quack for trying to remove addiction with tiny electrical currents, and that the one clinical trial of it found it to be ineffective. People magazine said there was \\"disbelief and even hostility from Britain's medical establishment and from the US medical world\\". Death and legacy In 1999, Patterson had a major stroke a week after opening a clinic in Tijuana. In 2001, she and her husband returned to Scotland, where she died on 25 July 2002. She was survived by her husband, a daughter, two sons, and five grandchildren. Her husband and one of her sons, Lorne, continued marketing the NET technique. As of 2012, evidence reviewed within NHS Scotland found no good evidence that neuro-electric therapy was helpful in treating opiate addiction.

Langelandsgade runs between the squares and traffic junctions of Vesterbro Torv, in the district of Aarhus C to the south, and Stjernepladsen, in the district of Aarhus N to the north. More than two-thirds of the street traverse the neighbourhood of Vesterbro. The street is close to 2 kilometres long and the southern half section is one of the steepest roads in Aarhus. Langelandsgade has a long history, it connects important buildings and structures in Aarhus and has a diverse architectural character.  Name  Langelandsgade is named after the Danish island of Langeland and the southern section is part of √ògadekvarteret (The Island Street Quarter), where all streets are named after Danish islands.  History  Galgebakken, the former medieval gallows hill of Aarhus at the intersection of Langelandsgade and Ny Munkegade. Langelandsgade originated as field roads in the Middle Ages and was originally referred to as \\"the road behind the city\\". Around 1600, executions by hanging were relocated from the central square of Store Torv (in front of the cathedral) to a hill along present days Langelandsgade, then far out of town. The gallows hill was abandoned in the late 1700s. In 1828, a brickworks was built along the southern end, and the road became known as Teglv√¶rksvej (Brickworks-road) for some time, but was officially named Brendstrupvej until 1899, when it was renamed to Langelandsgade. The first residential buildings were built in the 1880s and consisted of 2-3 storey apartment blocks in brick in the southernmost section and a few detached houses close to where the University is located nowadays. Some of them still exists. The brickworks was abandoned in 1917 and in 1921-27, the first large housing block on Langelandsgade was built on the site. The public housing apartment block was named Teglg√•rden (The-brick-yard), after the former brickworks. It was one of the first building projects to be realised by the local non-profit housing organization Arbejdernes Andels Boligforening (AAB - Aarhus).Aarhus Wiki: Arbejdernes Andels Boligforening Large sections along Langelandsgade remained undeveloped up until the 1960s when the modernist apartment blocks of Klostervangen (1968) and Vestervang (1970 and 1985) was built.  Facilities  Langelandsgade is an important road for transportation in Aarhus and connects the inner city to the ring road of Ring 1 and the intercity motorway of Randersvej.

Early life  Singh was born to Sanwal Singh and Gulab Kaur in Bharyal Lehri, Gurdaspur district of Punjab. Young Iqbal Singh was particularly fascinated by the lives of Dhruva and Bhakta prahlada on the one hand and Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh, the younger Sahibzadas of Guru Gobind Singh on the other hand. While in 6th grade, he was touched by the lives of Sanghamitta and Mahinda, the daughter and son of Ashoka.  Education and career  Singh completed a Bachelor of Science Agriculture in 1949 from Lyallpur, Pakistan. In Pakistan he met Teja Singh Ji and Attar Singh and was influenced by their teachings.

Iqbal Singh has been working with the support of beneficiaries and volunteers in the direction of imparting education in the rural marginalised areas of North India. He believes that rural children are excluded from the mainstream and cannot contribute to the nation's growth, hence the drive to ‚Äúeducate- enshrine-empower‚Äù these large masses is necessary. He established Eternal University at Baru Sahib in 2008 and Akal University, Guru ki Kashi at Damdama Sahib in Punjab in 2015.

In the institution established by him, students are punished even with expulsion if caught defiling their hair or beards as per Sikh tenets. Akal Academy became the center of a controversy in 2008. There was an allegation that the 'Turban' was being imposed on them. Akal Academy later replied to the controversy explaining that Sikh students were expected to wear the Turban and that children from other faiths needed to cover their heads with a simple patka (piece of cloth as a headgear).

On top of that, his research articles, essays, columns and other creative writings have been published in various local and foreign newspapers and journals. Malay Bhowmick at 1971. It was taken just after the liberation war of Bangladesh.  Role in the Liberation War  Malay Bhowmick is a valiant freedom fighter. In 1971, at the age of 15, Malay Bhowmick, a fierce teenager, left his home to fight for the liberation war of Bangladesh. He fought under Sector 7.  Role of Democratic Movement  In addition to his active participation in the Mass Revolt in 1969 and the liberation war in 1971, Bhowmick had an undeniable role in the mass movements against autocracy in 1990 and 1996. In 1993, when cultural activities were banned at the University of Rajshahi, Malay Bhowmick did not hesitate to protest. This then subjected him to torture by the police. In 1996, under the dynamic leadership of Bhowmick, Anushilan Nattadal, Udichi Rajshahi Zila Sangsad and Rajshahi Theatre jointly formed ‚ÄòJanatar Moncho‚Äô. The satirical script he wrote to recognize the manipulative election of the government of the time, was enacted at this very stage. On 24 August 2007, Malay Bhowmick protested against the government's anti-human rights activities. As a repercussion of this protest, special forces of the Army backed up by the caretaker government arrested him along with few other teachers of Rajshahi and Dhaka University. Upon remanding him, they tortured him and sent him to jail. In the face of intense mobilization, the then caretaker government was forced to release him from jail on 25 December 2007; he was later proven innocent by the court. He has also played a significant role in the construction of Teachers Students Cultural Centre (TSCC) and opening of Theatre and Music Department of Rajshahi University.  Awards and honors  Malay Bhowmick has been awarded the Bangla Academy Award in 2017 for his contribution to Bengali literature. He was also awarded the ‚ÄòMedal of Drama Activist‚Äô by Lok Natyadal, Dhaka in 1992. Other recognitions include the ‚ÄòMunir Chowdhury Award‚Äô in 2008 and the ‚ÄòAranyak Dipu Smriti Padak‚Äô in 2009 by the Aranyak Natyadal. He addresses the audience as a guest speaker at the ‚ÄòWorld Theater Day‚Äô organized in coordination of the International Theater Institute Bangladesh Center and Bangladesh Group Theater Federation on 25 March 2008. His drama ‚ÄòUttarkhona‚Äô is now included in the syllabus of the Theatre Department at Rabindra Bharati University, India.

Background  Extracted from Article 148 of the Constitution of Azerbaijan On 18 October 1991 Azerbaijan re-established its independence according to the Constitutional Act on Restoration of the State Independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani law system is based on civil law system. Constitution of Azerbaijan is the highest legal force in the country which was accepted in 1995 as the result of nationwide referendum. The separation of powers among legislative, judicial and executive branches were formed according to the Constitution. The legislative system of the Republic of Azerbaijan consists of normative-legal Acts as those: the Constitution, acts adopted by referendum, laws, orders, Resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan, Normative Acts of central executive power bodies. International Treaties, of which Azerbaijan is a party, compose an essential part of the legislative system of the Azerbaijan.  Separation of Powers  According to the Constitution, Azerbaijan is a democratic, legal, secular and unitary republic. Religion is separated from the State. State power is divided among 3 divisions: Milli Majlis (legislative), President (executive), and courts (judicial). Milli Majlis is one chamber body with 125 parliamentarians selected for 5 years term. The Head of the State of Azerbaijan is the President who is elected for 7 years term. Vice-President is the second-highest constitutional officer after the President in Azerbaijan, appointed and dismissed by the President. President forms Cabinet of Ministers with the leading of Prime Minister to implement executive power. Judicial power is implemented through Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, ordinary and other specialized law courts.  Legislative reform  After adaptation of Constitution (1995), new legislative acts and amendments were issued in line with democratic principles and in consistency with requirements of international law within the legal reforms.  Constitution and Constitutional Acts  * Constitutional Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on regulating the realization of human rights and freedoms in the Republic of Azerbaijan (29 December 1998); * Constitutional Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Approval of the Constitution of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (24 December 2002); * Constitutional Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Normative Legal Acts (21 December 2010).

Judicial reform  Decree on Modernization of Judicial system was signed on 19 January 2006 by the President of Azerbaijan and the country entered the next step in judicial system. New courts, as well as new appeal courts in regions were established to increase the effectiveness of justice and to make easier to access to courts for people in regions. Number of judges increased, court activities modernized, newly established courts were organized, and the apparatus of courts upgraded based on the Decree. New judicial system appointed appeal courts (composed of 4 chambers ‚Äì Civil, Criminal, Military and Administrative-Economic) in 6 regions of Azerbaijan to fulfill their duties on territorial jurisdiction. The courts of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic were set up in accordance with the blockade situation of the territory. The Supreme Court of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is the first-degree appeal instance for courts of Nakhchivan. The cassation instance for the Supreme Court of Nakhchivan AR is Supreme Court of Azerbaijan Republic. New mechanism of appealing directly to the Constitutional Court regarding the restoration of violated rights and freedoms was defined according to the Law on Constitutional Court (23 December 2003). The Amendments to the ‚ÄúLaw on Courts and Judges‚Äù and ‚ÄúLaw on Judicial-Legal Council‚Äù adopted as a result of cooperating with Council of Europe have played an important role in increasing effectiveness of justice. Judicial-Legal Council was set up referring to these acts, which are consistent with international principles. The new legislation regulates the immunity of the judges and their terms of office, indefinite term of appointment to the judge's office has been defined, disciplinary responsibility of judges has been assigned to the authority of the Judicial-Legal Council, and a new body - Judges Selection Committee has been established to elect the candidates for judge positions. Influential international financial institutions also supported the judicial-legal reforms carried out in Azerbaijan. For example, a joint project of the Ministry of Justice and World Bank entitled ‚ÄúModernization of the Justice Sector‚Äù implemented in the country. In the framework of the project, numerous court buildings were constructed, the infrastructure in this area was updated and the most up-to-date technologies was introduced in the courts. The role of prosecuting authorities in the judicial system was also reviewed in the framework of legal and judicial reforms, and its activities have been adapted to international standards and to the requirements of democratic institutions. Thus, a number of previous competences of public prosecution were revoked, warrant to issue arrests was granted to the courts, supervision over courts by Prosecutor‚Äôs office were eliminated according to the ‚ÄúLaw on Prosecutor's Office‚Äù (1999). As a result, the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of Azerbaijan became the independent body to start criminal case, carry out preliminary investigation, oversee the implementation of laws in the activities of investigative and operational-search bodies, and represent as a claimant on behalf of the state in civil issues.  Judicial- Legal Council  The Judicial-Legal Council of Azerbaijan was formed in February 2005 to implement self-governance functions of Judiciary system as the result of legal-judicial reforms in Azerbaijan. The Council consists of 15 members (9 of them are Judges and others are representatives of President, Parliament, Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, Bar Association, Ministry of Justice) who are selected by Milli Majlis. As a permanently functioning independent body, The Judicial-Legal Council is not dependent on legislative, executive or judicial authorities, local self-governance bodies, individuals and legal entities for organizational, financial or other issues. The Council is in charge with the organization of the judiciary system and independence of judges in Azerbaijan Republic; organization of selection of candidates to vacant judge positions who are not yet judges; evaluation of performance of judges; promotion, rotation of judges, as well as, other issues related to courts and judges. Constitution of Azerbaijan, international treaties to which it is a party, the law on Judicial-Legal Council, law on ‚ÄúCourts and Judges‚Äù and other legislative acts are the legal basis for the activity of the Judicial-Legal Council. It cooperates with legislative, executive and judicial authorities, Azerbaijan Bar Association, and scientific institutions. Besides, a special training department under the Council was set up to carry out training for judges and public prosecutors, including candidates to judge posts. According to new method of judge selection, multistage procedures, including testing, written and oral exams were developed starting from 2005. On the other hand, long-term training courses were organized for candidates to judge posts and a number of higher judges, prominent legal scientists, experts from different countries including Turkey; Commissioner for Human Rights of Council of Europe, Judges of European Court of Human Rights, specialists of ABA/CEELI took part in these courses. As the result of assessment of judicial staff‚Äôs activity, powers of up to 40 judges have been terminated, personnel of courts have been renewed, new courts, as well as regional appeal courts have been established, and number of judges have risen by 50%.  Constitutional reform  Taking into account the need to strengthen democratic values, implement judicial-legal reforms, protect human and civil rights and freedoms, amendments to the text of Constitution were made several times. In 2002, 2009 and 2016 the text of Constitution was amended and enriched by new provisions due to the results of referendums held through the country. The social- economic, public-political and cultural life of the country started to develop, large-scale infrastructure and construction project implemented in regard with the amendments.  Referendum 2002  The first referendum for amendments to the text of Constitution initiated by the former President Heydar Aliyev was held in 2002, 24 August. 39 changes were done to the 23 articles of the Constitution. These changes are categorized into 7 main groups, as * Changes arising from commitments undertaken by Azerbaijan Republic to European Council; * Changes arising from the accession of Azerbaijan Republic to European Convention on protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms; * Changes arising from the improvement of conducting referendum; * Changes to election process to Parliament of Azerbaijan Republic; * Changes to election process of the President of Azerbaijan Republic; * Changes arising from the improvement the activity of state authorities; * Changes arising from the implementation of judicial reforms. According to these amendments, proportional party list elections to Parliament was eliminated; citizen of the country, courts and human right commissioner gained right to appeal directly to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Azerbaijan; the procedure of transferring the powers of President to the Prime Minister instead of the Chairman of Milli Majlis in case of resignation was approved; the procedure of calculating the results of the presidential elections with a simple majority was defined.  Referendum 2009  The second Referendum Act on ‚ÄúAmendments and additions to the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù was put to a nationwide referendum on March 18, 2009. As a result, the Constitution was further upgraded and constitutional norms and principles were adapted to the requirements of the time with 41 amendments to 29 articles. The constitutional amendments of March 18, 2009 can be classified in 3 groups on several aspects: * The first classification is related to the enrichment of constitutional norms that define human rights and freedoms, the identification of new opportunities, the broader assurance and the formation of a more effective defense mechanism. E.g. the provision of \\"providing adequate standard of living for the citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan\\" to the Article 12. Article 17 that defines constitutional foundations of family, children and state relations was enriched with 4 new sections of greater importance. The content of Article 25 that defines right for equality; Article 32 that defines right for personal immunity and Article 71 that ensures the rights and liberties of a human being and citizen were enhanced with several new provisions; * The second aspect was the further improvement of the constitutional provisions that define the mechanism of the state power. Thus, it was supposed to make amendments and additions to the articles regarding the organization and activity of the Milli Majlis, as well as some articles defining the legal status of the President and the judiciary power. ‚ÄúThe term of office of the President of Azerbaijan Republic and Milli Majlis is extended until the end of the military operations in case the conduct of military operations does not allow holding elections‚Äù was added to Article 84 and Article 101; * Another aspect of the amendments was related to the improvement of the constitutional status of local self-government, in particular the independence of municipalities. Article 146 that defines the independence of municipalities, was enlarged with 4 new parts. New provisions define the independence of municipalities while defining its responsibilities for the citizens living in the municipality, exercising its power independently not undermining sovereignty of Azerbaijani state, and reporting to the Milli Majlis about the activities of municipalities in cases and in the manner prescribed by law.  Referendum 2016  The third referendum for amendments to the text of Constitution initiated by the President Ilham Aliyev was held on September 26, 2016. 34 amendments and additions to 23 articles, as well as 6 new articles that change the structure of the Constitution were made according to the results of the Referendum. Amendments are divided into 2 main categories: * enrichment of human rights and freedoms, adaptation to international universal and regional legal acts, improvement of safeguards and defense mechanisms; * improvement of principle of separation of powers, ‚Äúconfrontation and balance‚Äù mechanism, as well as political management and local self-governance activities. Within the first aspect, protection of human dignity and respect for it, and non-discrimination principles were added to Article 24; provision on the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities were added to Article 25; Article 32 provides the right of personal immunity (e.g. the provision of safeguarding of the protection of personal data), Article 36 prohibits lockouts for the protection of the rights of persons employed under labor contract (except in cases prescribed by law); Article 60 was amended to enhance the administrative and judicial support for rights and freedoms according to the results of the 2016 referendum.

Provision 103.1 that defines forming vice-president institute was added to Article 103; and several amendments to Article 105 and 106 were done arising from provision 103.1.  Ombudsman Office  As becoming a participant in the work of Council of Europe since 1996, Azerbaijan started to develop an effective mechanism to improve national legislation to the level of European standards. In the framework of this activity, On February 22, 1998 the President of Azerbaijan issued a decree ‚ÄúOn Measures for Ensuring Human and Civil Rights and Freedoms‚Äù and based on this decree, State Program on Protection of Human Rights was approved by the Decree of 18 June 1998. In the framework of this Program, Ombudsman Institute was set up. It happened on December 28, 2001, after The Constitutional Law ‚ÄúOn the Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù was adopted. There were several amendments done to this law on 1 September 2004, 3 March 2006, 19 October 2007, 19 June 2009, 26 November 2009, 6 May 2011, 24 June 2011, 27 June 2014 and on 15 April 2016. Elmira S√ºleymanova was appointed as the Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) according to the Decision ‚Ññ 362 of the Parliament of Azerbaijan on July 2, 2002. The main objective of this institute is to restore violated human rights and freedoms in accordance with the Constitution of Azerbaijan and the international treaties to which Azerbaijan is a party. Investigation of activities of the President, parliamentarians and judges of Azerbaijan are not the subjects of authorities of the Commissioner.

Encouraged to concentrate on art rather than languages and freelance journalism by Jeanne Nelson Szabo, a former Professor of Art at University of California Los Angeles, Cook initially exhibited watercolours in Westchester, New York, and elsewhere in New York from 1979 onwards. Cook was quickly accepted for membership in such artists‚Äô organisations as the Mamaroneck Artists Guild, Catharine Lorillard Wolfe Artists Club, New York, and the American Artists Professional League, New York, with which she often exhibited. She was subsequently selected for membership in the National Association of Women Artists, The Pen & Brush in New York, and Women‚Äôs Caucus for Art, as well as being a Signature Member of the Georgia Watercolor Society. In 1983, Cook moved with her husband to coastal Georgia, where the couple spent two years building a post-and-beam house bordering on salt water marshes. During this period, she set aside her art practice. When she returned to art, she began to draw in metalpoint, a medium little known amongst both artists and the general public. Soon Cook was exhibiting in solo shows in local museums and galleries in Georgia and beyond, and her drawings and watercolours began to enter numerous museum and private collections. Her work was acquired by the Georgia Art Acquisition Program for Gainesville College in 1986. In 2003, she was awarded a public art commission from the Fulton County Arts Council, Atlanta, Georgia. By 2011, Cook was increasingly specialising in drawing and painting far less in watercolours. Cook's drawing practice has continued both in the United States and Europe, with frequent solo and group exhibitions on both continents. Her work is now represented in such museums as the British Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum, and BAMPFA, in Berkeley, California, among many others around the world.

From an early age she had a keen interest in agriculture, and worked alongside the Africans, Afrikaans, British and Sikhs employed on the mixed farms. With her mother, Patricia Wright, guiding her, she learnt the correct botanical structure and petal colour of innumerable flowers grown commercially for seed, whilst also participating in the cultivation of coffee, seed beans and aromatic plants destined for the perfume trade. Cook's family members were committed environmentalists long before the term became a household word. Living with her parents and widely- travelled grandparents in the same house, Cook was exposed to Australian, European, Asian (particularly Japanese) and African cultural influences. This exposure almost certainly contributed to the development of her passion for nature, travelling and all forms of art. The long fascinated hours she spent in the darkroom with her photographer grandfather led to the genesis of her love of monochromatic photographs and drawings. In addition to these influences, she learned much of local and British politics as both her grandfather, Francis James Anderson, and father, Jack Wright, were very active politically. Cook finished her high school education at Limuru High School, outside Nairobi, Kenya, at the same time that the then Tanganyika (later Tanzania) became independent. She continued her studies in languages and business in London and Paris, then worked in an international organization, European Launcher Development Organisation (precursor to the European Space Agency), before taking another degree at EFAP, the French communications school. She married British scientist Albert Rundle Cook and moved to New York, where she divided her time between art and non-fiction writing, publishing work in Connoisseur Magazine and other publications. Cook and her husband moved to Georgia in 1983, where she became a full-time artist. Cook works from her studios in coastal Georgia and Palma de Mallorca. Her central practice is metalpoint drawing.  Career   Artistic Practice  Cook is among the early contemporary metalpoint artists currently employing the medium, having undertaken the practice in 1979. Prior to her metalpoint drawing, she had worked as a silversmith. Frequently cited in written works on the topic of metalpoint, Cook has also taught and presented talks on the technique and curated metalpoint exhibitions. Metalpoint was famously employed in European monasteries' scriptoria, such as Lindisfarne, in the 8th century AD but centuries before, in AD77, Pliny the Elder had alluded to drawing in silver in his Natural History. Highly conscious of metalpoint‚Äôs illustrious heritage, Cook draws mostly in silver, always from real life, and does not lay out any preparatory indications on the drawing surface before starting her drawing in metal. She believes that working directly from life confers spontaneity to a drawing, making it possible for intuition to guide the drawing and allowing the subject matter to dictate. For Cook, this method of drawing allows for unexpected results and opportunities to grow as an artist. Miro's Pine Tree 1, silverpoint, Jeannine Cook Rigorous in her choice of archival-quality materials, Cook most often prepares her smooth drawing supports in advance with acrylic-based grounds, particularly if she is drawing outdoors in hot and insect-filled environments. Working on paper, board, and occasionally porcelain, the artist lets the silver and copper drawings tarnish naturally. Summer Energy - Tillandsia recurvata, silverpoint, watercolour, Jeannine Cook Like other contemporary metalpoint artists, Cook experiments with the medium, exploring innovative ways to extend its unique properties. She frequently combines touches of colour with the monochromatic drawings, employing such media as Prismacolour, Polychromos pencil, watercolour, Plike paper, Washi papers, silk fabric and silk threads, whilst at other times she uses coloured grounds or coloured supports, such as in the drawing Tillandsia recurvata. Her artistic vocabulary also includes gold and silver foil and marks made with wide metal tools (spoons, rings or bracelets, wedges of silver, etc.). Her drawings on paper are executed in a range of sizes. Her oeuvre also includes artist books and watercolour paintings. Cook's use of the mark-making metals is varied in style, ranging from realistic drawings of flowers, landscapes and other natural subjects to seemingly abstract studies of barks, stones and other natural materials, often depicted realistically but at close range. Recent series have included Miro-inspired drawings done in and about the Fundaci√≥n Pilar i Joan Mir√≥ in Palma de Mallorca, Pensando en Miro, a series entitled Terratorium based on the Chablis region in Burgundy, France, and De Natvr√¶, studies of nature drawn from many different sources. Much of Cook's recent work has been carried out while in residency in France at La Porte Peinte Centre pour les Arts, Noyers sur Serein, Bordeneuve Retreat, Betchat (Ari√®ge), and H√¥tel Sainte Vali√®re, Sainte Vali√®re, as well as in Portugal, at OBRAS, Estremoz. As Cook has evolved as a metalpoint artist, her choice of subject matter has widened from the early botanical studies which betray the deep influence of her nature-oriented East African life. Deeply passionate about environmental issues, Cook reminds us to wake up, to look, to truly see nature. Her art acts as an advocate for a more informed look at our planet, at details that reveal nature's past and present: hurricane-struck red cedar trees that become burnished silver skeletons, tree barks that bespeak age and endurance, stones that tell of past geological dramas. Given that the majority of the world‚Äôs population is now urban, Cook sees the need to share with art lovers the intricacy, elegance and vital importance of even the smallest aspect of life in the natural world. The rarity and allure of the lustrous metalpoint medium arouse curiosity and offer a starting point for dialogue about much wider environmental issues and the rewards that await us when we awaken to nature‚Äôs riches.

The offensive was concurrent with the 2017 Central Syria campaign by the Syrian Army to capture ISIL territory towards Deir ez-Zor, as well as with the Raqqa campaign (2016‚Äì17) conducted by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) against ISIL's de facto capital city and stronghold in Syria.  Background  Hawija, which is located west of Kirkuk city, had been a bastion of Sunni Arab insurgents since the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. In 2013, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered his forces to open fire on peaceful protesters in Hawija. In return, Sunnis became convinced of using violence to counter Maliki's sectarian policies while also giving substantial support to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The group captured the city in June 2014 when it seized control of most of northern and western Iraq. It became isolated from the rest of the group's territory in July 2016 during the Mosul offensive and was its last stronghold in Iraq. The offensive had been repeatedly delayed due to various sectarian issues, as well as disagreements over the involvement of the Peshmerga and the Popular Mobilization Forces militia.  Timeline of the offensive  Shiite PMF reject claims according to which they harass local Sunnis as suspected ISIL supporters. The offensive began on 20 September, from the northwest of Hawija, as Iraqi forces recaptured four villages northeast of al-Shirqat (which itself was captured a year earlier during the 2016 Mosul offensive). On the following day, the Iraqi forces managed to liberate at least 11 villages in the Hawija pocket, killing and wounding several terrorists in the process. The goal of Iraqi forces is penetrating the city of Hawija with several side wings, as they want to secure these important areas in the Kirkuk Governorate. On 22 September, Iraqi forces liberated approximately 140 square kilometers of territory north of the district of Hawija from the Kirkuk Governorate. Led by Hashd Al-Sha'abi (Popular Mobilization Forces), Iraqi forces have liberated at least 15 villages in the Al-Shirqat district, located directly northwest of the country. On 24 September, the Iraqi forces declared that they had finished Phase 1 of the offensive, having liberated all of the areas north of the Al-Zab River, along with some other areas west of the Tigris River and in the northern Makhoul Mountains. They also stated that they killed 200 ISIL militants during the operation. On 29 September, Iraqi forces launched the second phase of the offensive, capturing four villages and entering the town of al-Abbassi. Iraqi forces reported that they killed another 200 ISIL militants on the first day of Phase 2 of the offensive. IRGC advisors during the 2017 Hawija offensive On 4 October, Iraqi troops entered the city of Hawija; with the local ISIL garrison showing relatively little resistance, the government forces quickly sized several neighborhoods. On the following day, Iraqi forces took control of the city centre and liberated the entire city. On October 8, the Iraqi Army cleared out the remaining ISIL-held points, and with the victory in Hawija, Iraqi Defense Ministry's War Media Cell released an updated map of the country, showing the remaining areas of Iraq under ISIL control now limited to the western Anbar Province and southwestern Nineveh Province. This offensive saw the first time that large numbers of ISIL fighters had surrendered en masse, instead of fighting to the death. It was also noted that in the \\"Hawija Pocket,\\" ISIL fighters put up little to no resistance at all, other than planting bombs and booby traps. Iraqi war hero Abu Tahsin al-Salhi was killed in action within this operation, on September 29th, 2017.

Its binary nature was confirmed by the Hubble Space Telescope in September 2016. Both primary and its minor-planet moon are similar in mass and size, making it a true binary system. The components are estimated to measure 1.8 kilometers in diameter, orbiting each other at a wide separation of 104 kilometers every 135 days.  Discovery  was discovered on 15 November 2006, by the Spacewatch survey at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The possible cometary activity was seen in November 2011 by Pan-STARRS.

Orbit and classification  is a non-family asteroid of the main-belt's background population. It is both a binary asteroid and a main-belt comet, also known as \\"active asteroid\\". It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì3.7 AU once every 5 years and 4 months (1,944 days; semi-major axis of 3.05 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins on September 2000, with a precovery taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico, more than six years prior to its official discovery observation by Spacewatch at Kitt Peak.  First binary main-belt comet  was first observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in December 2011. It was imaged by HST in September 2016, just before it made its closest approach to the Sun and confirmed its binary nature with two asteroids orbiting each other, and revealed ongoing cometary activity. This makes the object the first known binary asteroid that is also classified as a main-belt comet. The binary is thought to be the result of fission of the precursor caused by YORP-driven spinup. Observations of the HST revealed ongoing activity in this binary system. The combined features of this binary asteroid - wide separation, near-equal component size, high eccentricity orbit, and comet-like activity also make it unique among the few known binary asteroids that have a wide separation.  Physical characteristics   Diameter albedo and mass  has a derived diameter of kilometer.

Early life  A daughter of Alethea Mary Robinson and her husband Charles William Rutherford, a cousin of nuclear physicist Ernest Rutherford,Christchurch Press page 12, 12 March 1935 she was born in 1912, in Masterton, New Zealand. Rutherford was disabled by poliomyelitis at the age of ten. Although she left secondary education without qualifications she enrolled in the Canterbury College of Fine Arts (now Ilam School of Fine Arts) at the age of 26, and graduated with a diploma. She attempted to train as an occupational therapist in New Zealand but was turned down due to her disability. However, she travelled to the UK to attend the Liverpool School of Occupational Therapy, at the University of Liverpool, graduating in 1952.  Career  Following graduation, Rutherford returned to her home town of Masterton and worked as an artist and occupational therapist. In 1955 she was appointed deputy principal of the New Zealand School of Occupational Therapy in Auckland. Due to the lack of training opportunities in New Zealand she returned to the United Kingdom in 1957 to obtain a post- graduate diploma in education, specialising in occupational therapy. Rutherford took over as the principal of the School of Occupational Therapy in 1959 following the resignation of Hazel Skilton. Building on the work of the previous two principals, she developed the school's curriculum and was instrumental in gaining recognition for occupational therapy in New Zealand. After her retirement in 1972 Rutherford documented the history of the school, completing the document in 1976.  Artistic work  Works by Rutherford include My View No. 8 (Auckland Harbour).  Exhibitions  Rutherford exhibited with the Auckland Society of Arts and at the New Visions Gallery, including the Nikau Palms exhibition in 1967.  Frances Rutherford Lecture Award  In 1983 the Occupational Therapy New Zealand/Whakaora Ngangahau Aotearoa established the Frances Rutherford Lecture Award in her honour. The award is presented biennially at the Occupational Therapy New Zealand/Whakaora Ngangahau Aotearoa Conference and showcases outstanding role models and best practice for occupational therapists in New Zealand.

Early life Spencer was born on 8 May 1747. He was the son of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Trevor, 2nd Baron Trevor. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 10 April 1762 and was awarded MA on 6 May 1765. From 1766 to 1768 he undertook a Grand Tour through Austria, Italy and France. Career At the 1768 general election Spencer was returned as Member of Parliament for New Woodstock on the Marlborough interest. He was appointed a Lord of Trade in April 1770 but did not attend the Board regularly nor parliament itself. He resigned his seat in January 1771 and was elected MP for Oxford in a by election on 31 January 1771. He was returned for Oxford in 1774 and 1780. He was an ardent supporter of Fox throughout his career and after. In 1784 he was returned again for Oxford. Spencer was a member of a subscription committee set up to raise funds to support the Whigs in the forthcoming general election. He remained active in fund-raising appeals for the party for many years afterwards. In consequence the Duke of Marlborough replaced him as candidate for Oxford in 1790. Fox may have intended a seat for Winchelsea for him, but nothing transpired. He did not want to spent ¬£3,000 to buy a seat at Wootton Bassett or risk an expensive contest at Evesham,and did not want to be a liability on his party. He maintained a vain hope that the family interest would be available at Oxford, but it was not. In the 1790 general election he was elected MP for Wareham probably at the party's expense. In the 1796 general election the Whigs appear to have paid ¬£3,000 his return again at Wareham. However, he was in financial difficulties in 1799 and lost through gambling again so heavily that he had to sell his London house and pictures. He resigned his seat in February 1799. In March 1802 a vacancy arose for Spencer at Tavistock and he was elected at a by-election on 25 March 1802. In August 1802 he went to Paris with Fox, and met Napoleon with whom he discussed his great ancestor. Later when Napoleon was at St Helena Spencer sent him a biography of Marlborough. He was returned for Tavistock in the 1802 and 1806 general elections. He was Surveyor General of Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chases from February 1806 to March 1807. When Fox died his political raison d‚Äô√™tre was gone and he gave up his seat at 1807. He never ceased to lament and praise Fox. He resumed his seat for Tavistock in 1817 as a stopgap for the Duke of Bedford when Lord John Russell vacated the seat through illness and was returned in a by-election on 12 March 1817. Similarly he stood in for his own family at Woodstock in the 1818 general election although his nephew the Duke of Marlborough withdrew him from Woodstock in 1820. Personal life Woolbeding House Spencer was an inveterate gambler and having lost his official salary found himself in financial difficulties around 1781, until he was admitted to a twelfth share in Fox‚Äôs faro bank at Brooks's, with a fee of five or six guineas an hour. The circle surrounding Fox included Edward Bouverie, a fellow habitu√© of Brook‚Äôs, and his younger wife Harriet, the daughter of Sir Everard Fawkener, K.B. She was a society hostess and actively campaigned for the Whigs. She became Spencer‚Äôs mistress and the youngest Bouverie child, Diana, born in 1786 was acknowledged as a Bouverie but was referred to as ‚Äúthe tell-tale Bouverie, for there never was such a perfect indisputable Spencer, Lord Robert‚Äôs walking picture and the very prettiest creature that ever was seen‚Äù. By 1791 his profits from the faro bank were sufficient to allow him to purchase Woolbeding House in Sussex.British History Online. Woolbeding Spencer married his mistress Harriet Bouverie on 2 October 1811, a year after the death of her husband. Spencer retired to Woolbeding which he had tastefully embellished. He died on 23 June 1831, ‚Äúa venerable grave old man‚Äù. He left Wooldeding to his natural daughter Diana Bouverie whose mother had predeceased him. She married George Ponsonby.

Borankana is strongly connected to the culture of Botswana.The other used name for Borankana is Phathisi. Borankana is traditionally performed by both elderly people and young people. According to history, Borankana was performed during tribal activities only. It is believed according to history that only man and boys were the ones dancing whilst the females sang, clapped hands and Ululated during performances.  Origins of Phathisi/ Borankana  Borankana performances are estimated to have initiated by the year 1914 and 1916. According to history Phathisi came from a man tying down the lowest part of his trouser using a peg when he cycles. In the past, man used to work in mines using their bicycles and for one man to own a bicycle they have to be wealthy enough to be able to purchase one, and the trouser had to be tied hard to avoid toppling of the rider or the trouser being hooked by the chain. The same process of trouser pegging was used when performing Borankana.It was changed from pegging the lower part of the trouser to using shorts when performing the Borankana.

Early life  Gregory Dowling was born and raised in Bristol, England. He read English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating with a 1st Class Honours in 1978. In 1979 he travelled to Italy to teach English; he first arrived in Naples, where he lived in a small pensione for three months. He then moved to Siena, and in 1979 to Verona and found an English teaching job at the Oxford School, where he met his future wife Patrizia who was studying English at the time. While living in Verona, he visited Venice very often until he decided to move there, and began teaching English at the Oxford School based there.  Work   Academic career  In 1983 he began as Lettore (equivalent to Reader) in English Language at the Istituto Universitario di Lingue Moderne of Feltre before becoming lettore at the Universit√† Ca‚Äô Foscari of Venice in 1985. He kept this job until 1999 when he was appointed Ricercatore (equivalent to Assistant Professor) of Anglo- American Language and Literature at the Universit√† Ca‚Äô Foscari, and became Associate Professor in 2006. Throughout his academic career Dowling‚Äôs main areas of interest have been Second World War poetry, Contemporary American Poetry, English Novelists of the 19th century, the Romantic Poets, English and American writers and Italy, and Venice in the 18th century. He has published several works of criticism, anthologies, and translations, as well as many articles, essays and reviews on such subjects. Specifically, his book-length publications include David Mason: A Critical Introduction (a monography on the author of the verse-novel Ludlow); In Venice and in the Veneto with Lord Byron (a guidebook which traces Byron‚Äôs three-year experience in Venice); Someone‚Äôs Road Home: Questions of Home and Exile in American Narrative Poetry, which focuses on the works of H.W. Longfellow, Herman Melville, Wallace Stevens, Robert Frost, Anthony Hecht and Vikram Seth; and A Study of the English Verb. He has also co-edited a number of poetry anthologies, including Gondola signore gondola. Venice in 20th Century American Poetry, which explores American poetry on Venice, co-edited with Rosella Mamoli Zorzi, and Giovane Poesia Inglese, an anthology of contemporary British poetry, with Alessandro Scarsella.  Novels  Dowling is the author of six novels, often described as a blend of the thriller and detective genres. His first four novels came out between the mid 1980s and early 1990s: Double Take, an international intrigue type thriller; See Naples and Kill, which draws on Dowling‚Äôs experience living in Naples; Every Picture Tells a Story, a crime story set in Venice; and A Nice Steady Job, set in and around Verona, which came out in 1994. He then took a break from writing fiction to focus on his academic career, and returned in 2015 with the novel Ascension, a historical thriller set in 18th-century Venice, the first in the Alvise Marangon Mysteries series, centred on the protagonist Alvise Marangon, a half-Venetian, half-English tour guide who turns spy to help the Venetian intelligence services thwart imminent threats to the city; Ascension was named ‚ÄúHistorical Novel of the Month\\" in The Times, which described it as blending ‚Äúa laconic, amused style informed by American detective literature with a profound knowledge of Venetian geography and history. Stylish, clever and gripping.‚Äù The Four Horsemen, the sequel in the series, came out in the summer of 2017. Dowling is currently writing a third, although no publication date has been set yet.  Translations and editing  Dowling has translated various books from Italian into English, most notably the novel Veritas by Italian novelists Monaldi & Sorti, Enigma by the Sea (Enigma in luogo di mare) and The D Case (La verit√† sul caso D) by Carlo Fruttero and Franco Lucentini, and Francesco Da Mosto‚Äôs travel books Francesco‚Äôs Italy and Francesco‚Äôs Venice.

Development  The game was made as a result of a successful Kickstarter campaign. Obscura progressively released builds of the game for forum members to test and provide feedback. Initially conceived as a Western equivalent to the popular anime influenced yaoi, bara and slash fiction games, the game was made using the free game engine Ren'Py. Obscura did all of the character art, writing, and some of the programming, while Doubleleaf did the scene art, Badriel did the backgrounds, and Saguaro did the programming. The character of Brad took a while to create due to frequent rewrites. She relied on the community response to improve the game; in one instance she had previously removed a heavy-handed coming out scenario with the protagonist's parents, but after a community member noted the issue was never addressed, she decided to add it back but with a lighter more comedic tone. When the game was first beta released in 2013, it was not made available on Steam, increasing its obscurity. The game was approved on Greenlight in mid-2017, and released on Steam later that year. Obscura received positive emails and comments from gay males, who were thankful that a dating sim featuring gay relationships had finally been released. Of the game, she described Coming Out On Top as \\"neither a hardcore sex game nor a game with any overt social or political agenda. It's a story-based relationship game that's supposed to be fun and entertaining\\".  Plot  The basic premise involves the main character, Mark Matthews (although this name is changeable), coming out to his two roommates Penny and Ian before the commencement of his final year of college, and the different men who enter into his life as a result of the choices he makes. He also has a pet fish, who he will confide in if he shuts other interactions out of his life; one plot concludes with the protagonist being sexually mounted by his pet fish. The storyline has elements of a porn game, with explicit or censored (depending on the version of the game the player is using) image of Mark and another character performing sexual acts being unlocked during each plotline. The player may begin the game by flirting with many guys, but midway through, all other interactions fall away while the strongest is pursued. The game concludes when Mark, Penny and Ian graduate college. Main Dates *Alex - Mark's anatomy professor at college and potential racquetball partner who is in contention for tenure at the University. *Amos - an older man who is interested in wrestling, classic films and the poetry of Walt Whitman. *Brad - a slacker, football player and frat bro who Mark is hired to tutor. *Ian - Mark's roommate who has recently broken up with his girlfriend. *Jed - the straight edge lead singer of a punk rock band who lives in the apartment above Mark, Penny and Ian. *Phil - Penny's cousin who has just returned from the Marine Corps boot camp to support his father who is running for senate. Brofinder Bonus Dates *Cesar - a narcotics officer on Brofinder as part of a sting operation. *Donovan - a middle aged father who is trying to get used to dating again following a divorce from his wife. *Frank - a stripper that pretends to be a wealthy investor to impress Mark on their date. *Jake - a foodie who invites Mark to an all-you-can-eat buffet where the pair become trapped in an elevator. *Luke - an Irish rugby player that joins Brofinder to make friends and invites Mark to watch a movie at his dorm. *Oz and Pete - a couple who are interested in spicing up their relationship with a threesme. *Terry - a closeted pop star looking for discreet fun. *Theo - a video game developer using Brofinder to meet a guy he can take to his high school reunion. *Tommy - an affluent lawyer whose past mistake causes he and Mark to end up in a hostage situation.  Gameplay  The gameplay is the same as other interactive novels. Players tap the screen/click the mouse to progress through the story, and can make choices at crucial moments. Alongside clicking to progress through the story to choose which man to date, the player also has the options to help Mark improve his relationships with Penny and Ian or improve his academic performance by studying and working to earn money. Once an erotic image has been unlocked during the game, it is available in the \\"gallery\\" and can be viewed at any time. The player also has the choice to customise the beard and body hair options for each of the men, tailoring each to their personal taste. An update to the game allows Mark access to nine additional bonus dates which are initiated through the \\"Brofinder\\" app in the main menu and are much shorter than the dates in the main game and typically only unlock two or three images for the gallery.  Critical reception  Gaming Revolution reviewers thought the game was cute, humorous and entertaining, and a great explanation to a heterosexual man of what it's like to be a gay person. Rock, Paper, Shotgun deemed it as having one of the best written romcom scripts of any video game. Paste Magazine thought the game was a wasted opportunity to example stories and representations across the LGBITQ+ spectrum, rather than reinforcing already existing ones. NZ Gamer gave it a rating of 7.8/10. The ability to have a human-fish sexual relationship has been positively pointed out by many critics. Obscura revealed that initial criticism from the gay community came from their scepticism that a heterosexual woman could understand the gay male experience but that this criticism disappeared once gamers started playing the demo. The second major criticism focused on not catering to enough body types. Obscura admitted that there was an over-representation of the body type she found attractive and that it was more important to ensure there were fully fleshed-out Asian and African-American storylines.

He borrowed from the Italians the respect of natural prosody, good diction and the enhancement of the lyrics, but according to the French taste, he made good use of the art of embroidery while keeping a fair and refined declamation.

Initiated by Liz Mohn, it was launched in 1987 to provide support for young opera singers. It is considered an important forum for new talent, one that has marked the beginning of international careers for many participants. The competition is organized every two years by the Bertelsmann Stiftung in G√ºtersloh. It is one of the foundation's oldest projects.  History  Maria Celeng during the final concert in 2011 In 1985, the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Herbert von Karajan gave a concert at the to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Bertelsmann media group. During the event, Karajan spoke with Liz Mohn about the lack of programs for promoting new opera talent, saying that, compared to other countries, it was difficult to find suitable young singers in Germany. As a result, Mohn, who became a member of the Bertelsmann Stiftung's Advisory Board in 1986, organized an international singing competition. August Everding, general manager of the Bavarian State Theaters, played a key role by providing the specialized knowledge required to hold the event. Organized together with the managers' committee of the Deutscher B√ºhnenverein, the association representing Germany's theaters and orchestras, the first competition took place at the G√ºtersloh Community Center in October 1987. In contrast to other events designed to promote new talent, the Neue Stimmen participants performed on a large stage in a concert hall, which they had to fill vocally. They were also accompanied by a symphony orchestra. In conjunction with the competition, the Bertelsmann Stiftung organized a symposium at which experts debated cultural policy issues. The symposium was also held in subsequent years. Neue Stimmen was initially a European singing contest since only artists who trained in Europe qualified to participate. One noteworthy aspect is that singers from Eastern Europe competed right from the start. Beginning in the 1990s, artists from other countries also participated, for example from China, Israel, Japan, Korea and the United States. Neue Stimmen thus took on its current international form. The number of applicants has grown steadily through the years. Approximately 1,500 applications are now submitted for each competition. After events in 1987, 1988 and 1989, the organizers began holding competitions every two years. The first master class took place in 1997 and has been held ever since in the years between the competitions. It supports the development of particularly talented singers who have previously competed in Neue Stimmen. In 2012, a lied master class was added, which was also held in 2013 and 2014. The organizers want to use this event to maintain the lied as an art form.  Competition  The Neue Stimmen competition has existed for 30 years. In 2017, 1,430 singers from 76 nations applied to compete. The rules stipulate that contestants must be enrolled in a music conservatory and must already have learned or performed a role. Female singers up to the age of 28 and male singers up to 30 may apply. The jury selects the best 40 or 45 talents during preliminary auditions. The auditions take place around the globe in impartial, professional settings, in locations such as Beijing and New York City. After that, the top-performing singers are invited to G√ºtersloh for the final round, which consists of semifinals and finals. These events are open to the public and the contestants receive support from r√©p√©titeurs. Since 2013, a first, second and third prize have been awarded to the top three female and top three male singers, a structure that allows for a fairer evaluation of the participants. It is also possible for two contestants to tie for the same prize if the jury feels that their performances are of equal caliber. An Audience Prize and other special awards designed to promote the singers' development are also given. Neue Stimmen prizewinners receive a cash award that reflects their place in the competition's final standings. They also receive long-term support, for example in securing high-profile engagements. Opera house directors and agents use the competition to scout for new talent and to bring promising singers from around the world to the venues they represent.  Jury  August Everding chaired the jury from 1987 to 1997 and died shortly before the 1999 competition. He was succeeded in 1999 and 2001 by Ren√© Kollo. In 2001, Peter Ustinov became honorary jury chairman and patron of the Neue Stimmen competition. Gerard Mortier led the jury in 2003, 2005 and 2007, a role that has been filled by Dominique Meyer since 2009. The competition's artistic director is .

Its frescoes from 1507 were painted by his sons Ludovico and Francesco and by a young Correggio. The tomb bears a bronze figure of Mantegna by Gianmarco Cavalli. History Court painter to the Gonzagas for over 40 years, Mantegna's prestige meant he was granted a funerary chapel in the basilica which served their Marquisate of Mantua - this was the first side-chapel on the left beside Leon Battista Alberti's nave. Correggio was probably in Mantua at the time of Mantegna's death and probably came up with the overall scheme as well as doing much of the actual painting.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433485 on 2017-09-21 Description The length of the shell attains 6.3 mm, its diameter 2.5 mm. (Original description) The shell is ovately fusiform. The color is light brown, whitish at the base of the body whorl and outer lip. It contains 6 whorls with 1¬Ω whorls in the apex. The succeeding whorls form the protoconch, globose, large, smooth. The subsequent whorls are turreted, angulated at the upper part at a short distance from the suture, beneath the angulation, which is rounded, sloping inward, so that they are much narrower at the lower part than at the angle, obliquely costate, and striated by the incremental lines. The ribs are very thick (12 on the penultimate whorl), subacute at their edge, and almost adjacent to one another at their bases, thinner and at times sublamellar at the upper extremities, and very obliquely flexuous from the angle downwards. On the last whorl they gradually become obsolete below the middle. The aperture is small, livid brown within, except near the lip, where it is whitish. The outer lip is thin at the extreme edge, strengthened exteriorly by the last well-developed rib, which is white with a single livid-brown spot a little below the middle. The sinus is scarcely discernible. The columella is smooth, slightly oblique, subrectilinear, covered with a thin callosity which unites at the upper extremity with the termination of the outer lip. The siphonal canal is very short.Smith, E.A. (1879) On a collection of Mollusca from Japan.

The path follows the route of a former railway, that of the Great Northern railway line between Bradford and Keighley that went via Queensbury and Cullingworth. The path has been designated as part of the National Cycle Route number 69. History The Great Northern Railway (GNR) opened up its lines connecting Bradford, Halifax and Keighley between 1878 and 1884. This involved a triangular junction at Queensbury railway station. As the GNR lines were built after other railways had been constructed in the valley's, many of their lines were built to traverse the high valley sides and as such, had many steep gradients and tunnels which led to them acquiring the nickname of The Alpine Lines. Passenger traffic on these lines had ceased by 1955, with complete closure of the lines by 1972 and much of the trackbed was abandoned and the tunnels bricked up. In 2005, Sustrans and Bradford Council re-opened a section of the former track from the site of Cullingworth railway station to the former station of Wilsden as the Great Northern Railway Trail. In 2008, a smaller section through Thornton village and across the viaduct there was opened, along with a second stretch between the former Queensbury railway station and a point just south of Thornton Viaduct. The final stretch to connect the two sections from Thornton Viaduct to the former station site at Queensbury opened in October 2012. Eventually the trail will cover , but currently this is split into two sections some apart. Although the whole trail is seen as one through route, only the sections between Cullingworth and Hewenden Viaduct, and Queensbury station and the northern edge of Thornton Viaduct are designated clear of road traffic. The section between these two is accomplished on footpaths for walkers, but cycle traffic must take to local roads to connect between the two sections. Sign at the start of the trail in Cullingworth Since the initial re-opening in 2005, smaller sections have opened in a piecemeal fashion which add to either end of the two split sections. The route connects with two other long distance paths; the Calder/Aire Bridleway in Cullingworth and the Bronte Way at Thornton. Infrastructure There are three viaducts on the route; Cullingworth, Hewenden and Thornton. Both Hewenden and Thornton viaducts are grade II listed structures and Thornton is particularly noted for its 'S' shaped curvature and its views over the Pinch Beck valley. A platform has been installed at Hewenden to allow for a greater views across the viaduct and westwards across Hewenden reservoir. The missing section between the south end of Hewenden Viaduct and the north end of Thornton viaduct includes five disused tunnels; Well Head (), Hamer's Hill (), Doe Park No 1 (), Doe Park No 2 () and Doe Park No 3 (). Future Sustrans, Bradford Council and local campaigners are all lobbying to get the route opened fully between Bradford and Keighley, with an extension through the long Queensbury tunnel towards Halifax. A Sustrans report into re-opening the route (and Queensbury Tunnel) revealed that the best case scenario would cost ¬£11.6 million over 30 years, but this would yield ¬£37.6 million in economic, health and tourism benefits over the same time period. Because of damage inside Queensbury tunnel and the lack of maintenance, the current owners of the tunnel (Highways Agency Heritage Railway Estate) have suggested that the tunnel be sealed off with concrete which would cost ¬£3 million. Campaigners state that it would be more beneficial for the community to convert the tunnel into the longest underground cycleway in Europe. The southern portal of the tunnel is in a deep cutting and is prone to flooding (as deep as of water at times) and so would need remediation to make it safe again. An extension south westwards from Queensbury is planned (with or without the tunnel) to Holmfield in Halifax.

He raced only as a two-year-old in 1987 when he won two minor races an finished fourth in the Coventry Stakes before winning the Phoenix Stakes which was at that time the most valuable race for juveniles in Europe. He was well-beaten in two subsequent races and never appeared of the racecourse again. He sired many minor winners but made relatively little impact as a breeding stallion. He died in 2011 at the age of twenty-six. Background Digamist was a \\"rangy\\" chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and two white socks, bred in Kentucky by the bloodstock company Seahorse '84. As a yearling he was consigned to the Keeneland Select sale and was bought for $625,000 by representatives of Khalid Abdulla. The colt was sent to race in Europe and entered training with Jeremy Tree at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. He was ridden in most of his races by Pat Eddery. He was sired by Blushing Groom, who won the Grand Crit√©rium in 1976 and the Poule d'Essai des Poulains in 1977 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His progeny included Arazi, Blushing John, Nashwan, Rahy, Rainbow Quest and Snow Bride. Digamist's dam Disconiz was a successful racemare who won seven races including the 1980 edition of the Princess Stakes. Disconiz's female-line ancestors had been bred in South America for several generations, being descendants of the British mare Flitaway (foaled in 1905) who was exported to Argentina in 1910. Flitaway was a half-sister to the influential broodmare Sterling Balm. Racing career 1987: two-year-old season Digamist finished third to Ship of Fools in a minor race over five furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on his track debut and then won a maiden race over the same distance at Kempton Park. The colt was then stepped up in class and distance for the Group 3 Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot on 16 June and finished fourth of the thirteen runners behind Always Fair, Oakworth and Ship of Fools. He was equipped with a visor when he contested the Crowthers Stakes at York and won very easily from three opponents. On 9 August Digamist was sent to Ireland for the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse and started the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Oakworth, Bellefella (runner-up to Warning in the Richmond Stakes) and Sadler's Wells's sister Fairy Gold. The other eight runners included Ship of Fools, Flutter Away (Railway Stakes) and Saintly Lass (second in the Queen Mary Stakes). The race carried first prize money of ¬£149,954, making it by far the most valuable race for juveniles in Europe. After tracking the leader Ship of Fools he moved up to dispute the lead a furlong out and saw off a sustained challenge from Oakworth to win by a neck. Digamist failed to reproduce his best form in two subsequent races. In September he was sent to France and started favourite for the Prix de la Salamandre over 1400 metres at Longchamp but came home fifth of the six runners behind Common Grounds. In the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket he finished last of the five runners in a race won by Gallic League. In the official International Classification for 1987, Digamist was given a rating of 114, making him eleven pound inferior to the top-rated pair Ravinella and Warning. The independent Timeform organisation rated him on 100, seventeen ponds behind Warning, who was their top-rated juvenile. Stud record Despite reports that Digamist would resume his racing career in North America he did not race again and was retired to become a breeding stallion. He was based at the Irish National Stud until 1993, and was then returned to his native Kentucky where he stood at the Crown Colony Farm and later at the Margaux Stud. In 1997 he moved to Xanthus Farm near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania where he remained for the rest of his life. He was euthanised in February 2011 owing to \\"complications from old age\\". Digamist sired champions in Panama and Austria, while the best of his North American runners included the Canadian stakes winner Second Chance. Pedigree *Digamist was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Nasrullah, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

Life  Raised in the 90s-era of East Germany Davis got in contact with the hip-hop and techno scene which both where omnipresent in Germany at the time. The DJ was a central figure in this movement and inspired Davis to become a DJ himself and to create his first own electronic productions. Due to his classical guitar education he already gained foreknowledge for melodic compositions which he then could incorporate in his productions.  Career  To this day the emphasis on melody is a trademark of Davis productions. In 2012 he published his first LP 'Particles of Bliss' on the record label Traumschallplatten. The increasing support of well-known DJs and producers of the electronic scene such as Aphex Twin at the Day & Night Festival 2017, Kiasmos, Dominik Eulberg or Apparat but also from bands like Depeche Mode - who played his music as opening act at the ‚ÄòSound of the Universe‚Äò tour  emphasizes Davis standing and range in the musical landscape. For approximately 8 years he is touring worldwide and played his songs amongst others in Japan, Africa, Canada, Australia, India, Europe and Russia. Davis sees himself as a nomad who is drawn to labels that are open for his musical visions. Therefore, he is currently working with the British label Anjunadeep. Further releases on avant-garde labels such as Erased Tapes or Injazero show the constant development and diversifification of Davis' spectrum.

He created the first bibliography of Western language publications on East Asian numismatics. Family life Howard Bowker was born on 3 January 1889 in Winona, Minnesota, the third of seven children. After graduating from the Crane High School (Chicago) in 1903, at the age of fourteen, he went to work at the Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company to help support the family. He married Violetta (\\"Letta\\") in 1912. They had three sons: Hoawrd Franklin Bowker Jr (born 1914), Gordon Albert Bowker (born 1917), ad Irving Allen Bowker (1922-1995). The first son was a Marine Corps Major; the second served in the US Navy; the third served in the US army. After retirement from the Navy, Bowker and his wife retired to Oakland, California. He died on 8 July 1970.\\"Howard Franklin Bowker, Sr\\", by Ron Guth, Bruce Smith, and the Bowker Grandchildren, in Journal of East Asian Numismatics (JEAN), no. 5, 2017, pp. 45-58. Naval career He joined the navy in October 1912, and served for 34 years, including both World War I and World War II, mostly in administration, usually associated with payroll. He served on board the , , , . He was stationed at the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines from 1921 to 1923, then assigned to the Naval Garrison at Hankow from May 1923, to April 1924.

He retired from the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant Commander on 23 December 1945. Numismatic career By 1910 Bowker was a self-proclaimed, self-employed coin dealer in the Chicago area. He became interested in Chinese coins while stationed in Hankow (1923-1924). He visited collections at the Smithsonian Institution, the American Numismatic Society, the University of Pennsylvania, and was an active member of the Numismatic Society of China, the Pacific Coast Numismatic Society, the American Numismatic Society, and the American Numismatic Association. His service with the Navy enabled him to collect both in the USA and overseas, and to meet with collectors (e.g. Kalgan Shih, Eduard Kann). He curated a large exhibition of Chinese numismatic material at the California State Numismatic Society's show in Santa Rosa in 1951 (featuring pieces from his collection, the A.G. Adams collection, pieces borrowed from A.B. Coole and other collectors). In the mid-1950s he provided consulting services to the Smithsonian Institution, a position that became official in 1958. His collections In his will, Bowker stipulated that his collections should go to the Smithsonian Institution. His philatelic collections are now part of the National Postal Museum in Washington, DC. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to transfer the numismatic collection to the Smithsonian, after which they went into storage and disappeared for 38 years. After Violetta's death in 1972, the collection passed to Bowker's son Irving, and on his death, to his widow Nancy. The collection was rediscovered by Michael Chou and Bruce W. Smith in 2007. Michael Chou, serving on behalf of the Bowker family, was engaged to contact museums in China. Chou bought Bowker's library of numismatic books and donated it to Bruce W. Smith.

History Hopkins was born on Colaba, Mumbai, India to Francis William Hopkins, RN, and Margaret Hopkins, n√©e McNeil, and was educated in England. He was a cousin of General Sir George Chesney and Colonel Charles Chesney (authors of Battle of Dorking and Lee's Campaigns in Virginia and Maryland respectively), and nephew of Francis Rawdon Chesney. Hopkins left England for Australia around 1865, and worked for his uncle John Wilson, brother of Sir Samuel Wilson, at \\"Woodlands\\" near Crowlands, Victoria in the Wimmera district of Victoria, 1866‚Äì1871. He managed Toorangabby station near Echuca 1871‚Äì1875 and others of Sir Samuel Wilson's properties. In 1877 he was managing nearby Pericoota station, with its magnificent two-storey homestead, for Robertson and Wagner. In 1885, in partnership with Alexander Wilson (another brother of Sir Samuel) he purchased Errowanbang station near Carcoar, New South Wales, where he bred hybrid sheep from Havilah Merino ewes and Romney Marsh rams. It is reckoned his run could have reached something like 40,000 sheep. In 1889 Hopkins, with Wilson and Charles Hebden (1851‚Äì1915), purchased Coubil and Welbondongah stations in the Gwydir Shire in New South Wales, but did not leave Errowanbang.  Writing  Hopkins found time to exercise his talent for writing, creating a number of works that critics found stimulating, including two collections of short stories, Birds of Passage and The Opium Runner. The second volume got its title from his story of a smuggler who built a submarine vessel to carry his contraband cargo. He wrote the plays All for Gold or Fifty Millions of Money, based on Eug√®ne Sue's, Wandering Jew, and staged by Alfred Dampier, Phil K. Walsh and others, Reaping the Whirlwind: an Australian patriotic drama for Australian people and All for Love. He also wrote The Confessions of a Cynic, \\"the outcome of many years' observation of bush social life\\". For many years he was reviewer and theatre critic for The Pastoral Review. Other interests Hopkins took no part in party politics, but *His support helped the \\"Church and Schools Act\\" to get passed by the Carruthers government. *He was chairman of the Carcoar Pastures Protection Board and a founder of the Pastoralists' Union. *He was a generous supporter of patriotic causes *He was a member of the Australia Day Fund committee. Death On the morning of 20 July 1916 Hopkins set out on horseback to inspect his flock, and when he failed to return by lunchtime an employee set out and found the horse hitched to a tree and Hopkins dead nearby, drowned in a disused mine shaft. His coat and hat were nearby. It was assumed he was investigating ways to prevent his sheep entering the shaft, when he lost his footing and accidentally fell in and either lost consciousness or could not escape. Hopkins, long regarded as a confirmed bachelor, on 8 January 1884 married Sarah Jane Kennedy (c. 1858 ‚Äì 13 April 1943). He was survived by his wife and a son, Rawdon Chesney Hopkins, who continued management of Errowanbang station.

The Faroe Islands are a group of eighteen islands between Iceland and Norway, and they are a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. There are approximately 50,000 Faroese people living in the Faroe Islands today.Faroe Islands Tourist Guide It is not known how many Faroese Americans there are.Michael J Douma, \\"Faroese Americans: Some Preliminary Research on an Immigrant Group Without A Written History\\", 3 June 2016 History The Faroe Islands were originally settled by the Norse around 800AD, and remained in contact with Iceland and Scandinavia throughout the Viking Era. This was a part of the same movement that brought the Norse to North America around 1000AD. Jonathan Wylie, [\\"The Faroe Islands: interpretations of history.\\"], University Press of Kentucky, 2015. Population Restriction by Denmark Unlike many European countries, the Faroe Islands did not industrialize and were not experiencing population pressures to immigrate to the United States. In fact, the opposite was occurring. Due to shipping restrictions and monopolistic control of goods traveling to the Faroe Islands, there was a famine, especially noted with a lack of grain going to the Faroe Islands from Denmark. Additionally, Danish laws were created that effectively barred the poor from marriage to keep the population low. Reasons for Immigration Faroese American immigration differs significantly from that of most groups of Europeans. Faroese Americans did not come to the United States in large groups, but instead came as individuals. Men often immigrated to the United States due to work, especially as sailors. Women often immigrated to the United States through marriage to Americans. Because of the individual style of immigration and the smaller numbers, there is not as cohesive a Faroese American community, as there is for many other immigrant groups to the United States. Some Faroese Americans also converted to Mormonism and Seventh-day Adventism, and so then moved to Denmark to be a part of the larger Mormon and Seventh Day Adventist communities there. From Denmark, some further immigrated to the United States, often in larger groups, as was common for Danish emigration. However, very few people overall left the Faroe Islands.Coull, James R. [A comparison of demographic trends in the Faroe and Shetland Islands.] Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 41 (1967): 159-166. Faroese Ethnic Identity Faroese ethnic identity is rooted in a strong sense of place, hospitality, and family connections. Faroese people have a strong tradition of hospitality, which includes inviting distant family members they have never met to stay at their house or for a complete meal. In the Faroe Islands, many people keep in touch with distant relatives, even so far as third cousins, and so family connections are extremely important.Visit Faroe Islands, [F√¶r√∏sk kultur] http://old.visitfaroeislands.com/dk/faa-et-indtryk/vil-du-vide- mere/kultur/ Faroese Hospitality A striking difference between Faroese and standard American culture is the strong tradition for hospitality. Faroese Americans traveling back to the Faroe Islands have especially been surprised to be welcomed into the homes of distant family members whom they have never met. Invitations for \\"coffee\\" typically includes rye bread and all of the traditional toppings, such as cold cut meats, cheeses, pickled or dried fish, and Skerpikj√∏t (fermented lamb). Difficulty in Determining Numbers Because the Faroe Islands are a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, Faroese people have Danish citizenship. This means that in old census records, Faroese Americans would identify themselves as having Danish citizenship. Compounding this issue, Denmark created some laws that forced Faroese people to adopt a consistent last name during the 1800s, and the new last names were often Danish.Ministeren for Familie‚Äë og Forbrugeranliggender (Lars Barfoed) [Forslag til Navnelov] https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=100765& Especially common are Jensen and Joensen, which are indistinguishable from Danish last names. Therefore, it is an extremely difficult task to estimate the number of Faroese Americans based on census records. Additionally, handwritten records may be mis-transcribed as the Fiji Islands, the Virgin Islands, the Azores Islands, Rhode Island, Fayal Island, the Island of Fohr, or others. Additionally, spelling mistakes for villages from the Faroe Islands makes it difficult to determine immigration. This makes handwritten records unreliable or incomplete concerning the Faroe Islands. Instead, passenger lists should be explored. Research in Faroese, Danish and American achieves is ongoing. Faroese Settlement in the United States There is evidence that Faroese Americans settled widely across the United States, and did not refine themselves to simply the areas settled by many Scandinavian Americans. In context, this makes a lot of sense, as Faroese Americans immigrated mostly as individuals, and often had different skill sets than Scandinavian Americans, namely, seafaring abilities. Additionally, around the 1850s, the Faroe Islands started to develop their own national identity, and so many Faroese Americans may not have identified closely with Scandinavian Americans that they would feel the need to live amongst them.No Nation Is an Island: Language, Culture, and National Identity in the Faroe Islands. Tom Nauerby. North Atlantic Monographs, 3. √Örhus, Denmark: SNAI-North Atlantic Publications; distributed by Arhus University Press, 1996. 237 pp. However, there is anecdotal evidence that many Faroese Americans settled in Colorado and the West Coast. Faroese Spoken in the United States Some Faroese Americans have retained their language, but it has been very difficult until more easily accessible technology to actively keep the language with the next generation, and so many descendants of Faroese Americans do not speak Faroese.

Lovecraft's novella At The Mountains of Madness. The game was developed by Turkish game development studio Zoetrope Interactive, published by Dutch indie game publisher Iceberg Interactive, and was released in June 2017.  Premise  Conarium follows four scientists in their endeavor to challenge what we normally consider to be the absolute limits of nature. The scientist sought to transcend human consciousness with the use of a so-called Conarium device. The player controls Frank Gilman, one of the four scientists of the Antarctic expedition. At the beginning of the game Gilman wakes up alone at Upuaut, a research base located in Antarctica. The room where he wakes up has a strange device on the table emitting odd noises and with pulsating lights. Gilman has no idea what the device is, nor has he any recollection of what happened prior to him passing out. He discovers the research base abandoned, with no trace of the other scientists. Gilman must uncover what happened to the others of his expedition by exploring the Antarctic base and its surroundings. During his search he experiences strange visions and dreams, which feel like memories that he cannot place.  Gameplay  Playing from a first-person perspective, players must explore the Antarctic base to solve the mystery of what happened to the other expedition members. This objective is achieved by exploring the environment and solving puzzles. Players can find and look at notes, journals, and other documents.  Development  Conarium was developed by Zoetrope Interactive, a Turkish indie developer consisting of three members: Galip Kartoƒülu, Onur ≈ûamlƒ±, Oral ≈ûamlƒ±. They previously worked on Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder and Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage, also published by Iceberg Interactive. Conarium was originally announced as ‚ÄúMountains of Madness‚Äù in 2015. Iceberg Interactive signed the game in July 2016. The game was released on June 6, 2017 for Microsoft Windows. Versions for Linux and MacOS were released on February 5, 2018. Conarium was made using the Unreal Engine 4. Having been favourably received by PC gamers; on February 12, 2019 the game found its way onto consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One).  Reception  Conarium currently holds a weighted average score of 71/100 on Metacritic based on 23 critic reviews. The Telegraph praised the game for its Lovecraftian atmosphere: \\"It's rare to find a jaunt into the world of the Cthulhu Mythos that stays so true to the feel without retreading old ground, and for that alone, Conarium is a must-play for fans of the tentacled one and his many eldritch buddies\\", and awarded it four out of five stars. Polygon Philip Kollar noted that the game \\"Conarium could have pushed deeper, but it stays true to the spirit of Lovecraft's work.\\" and scored the game a 7.5 out of 10. Chris Shive of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a positive review and called attention to its soundtrack, noting that \\"Conarium soundtrack sets an ominous mood of dread and is effective in creating this Lovecraftian waking nightmare Frank has to navigate.\\" Conarium was chosen to showcase at IndieCade Festival 2017. Conarium won ‚ÄúThe Game of the Year‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest PC Game‚Äù at the Kristal Piksel (Crystal Pixel) Video Game Awards 2017 ceremony, an annual awards ceremony for the Turkish game industry.

The emperor Farrukhsiyar was deposed by influential Sayad brothers in 1719. He was succeeded by the short reigns of Rafi ud-Darajat and Shah Jahan II. Finally Muhammad Shah was raised to the throne by them. To make peace with powerful vassal, he appointed Aj√≠tsingh of M√°rw√°r as a viceroy. The Maratha incursions continued and P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r established himself at Songad near southern border of Gujarat. Ajit Singh had appointed Anopsingh Bhandari as his deputy. For helping to depose the influential Sayad brothers, Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n was appointed the next viceroy. People discontent with Anopsingh rejoiced his appointment but he tried to make himself free so he was recalled. Niz√°m-ul-Mulk took over who had to face the Maratha incursion again. The Marathas taking advantage of weakening Mughal Empire started extracting tribute from Gujarat regularly. The next viceroy Sarbuland Khan came in conflict with the Marathas whose generals were first defeated at Kapadvanj and again at Aras. The infighting in Marathas later stalled their advances. The imperial troops was sent by the emperor to help. Finally the Marathas were defeated at Sojitra and Kapadvanj and pushed back from their inroads in Gujarat. In subsequent years, the Marathas attacked Vadnagar and later captured Baroda, Dabhoi and Champaner. The growing power of Marathas in the southern Gujarat can not be contained. In 1730, Abheysingh was appointed as the viceroy who defeated Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk at Adalaj who has opposed his appointment. He soon allied with Maratha Peshwa and defeated another Maratha Gaikwar. He returned to Marwar placing Ratansingh Bhandari, his deputy, in charge. He recovered Baroda but his rivalry with other Mughal leaders Momin Khan and Sohrab Khan weaken him. Soon Momin Khan was appointed as the viceroy but he had to laid siege of Ahmedabad to be in power as Ratansingh had not complied with the order. Soon the emperor reappointed Abheysingh but Momin Khan continued siege. He took help of Damaji Gaikwar and finally captured Ahmedabad. He had to share revenues with Gaikwars but soon disagreements rose and they had fights. He tried to manage his control over Gujarat but the Marathas keep growing and expanding their power. After death of Momin Khan, Fid√°-ud-d√≠n managed the province foe a while. Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z Kh√°n, the commander of Junnar near Pune came to power due to forged order but later had to relinquish. Muftakhir Kh√°n, son of Momin Khan, appointed as the next viceroy. During his reign, the Marathas came to Ahmedabad and continued to attack towns in central Gujarat. Fakhr-ud-daulah succeeded him. He had some peace due to internal struggles between the different houses of the Marathas had slow down their advances in Gujarat. In 1748, Muhammad Shah died and he was succeeded by his son Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Viceroys under Muhammad Shah (1719‚Äì1748) Early in 1719, the emperor Farrukhsiyar was deposed and put to death by his nobles the Sayads; and a prince named Rafi ud-Darajat, a grandson of the emperor, was raised to the throne. Rafi ud-Darajat was put to death by the Sayads after a reign of three months, and his brother Rafi ud-Daulah as Shah Jahan II, who succeeded him, also died after a few days' reign. The Sayads then raised to the throne prince Roshan Akhtar Bahadur with the title of Muhammad Shah. Mah√°r√°ja Aj√≠tsingh, Forty-ninth Viceroy, 1719‚Äì1721 After the murder of Farrukhsiyar, the most powerful vassal in the neighbourhood of Delhi was Aj√≠tsingh of M√°rw√°r. To win him to their side the Sayads granted him the viceroyalty of Gujar√°t, and M√≠hr √Åli Kh√°n was appointed to act for him until his arrival, while Muhammad Bah√°dur B√°bi, son of Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, was placed in charge of the police of the district immediately round √Åhmed√°b√°d. Shortly after, through the influence of the Mah√°r√°ja Aj√≠tsingh, N√°hir Kh√°n superseded M√≠hr √Åli Kh√°n as deputy viceroy. N√°hir Kh√°n was also appointed to the charge of Dholka, Dahod and Petlad, and made superintendent of customs. About this time the head tax was repealed, and orders were issued that its levy in Gujar√°t should cease. ;P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r at Songa·∏ç, 1719. In the same year, 1719, P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r marched on Surat with a large army and defeated the Mughal troops commanded by Sayad √Çkil and Muhammad Pan√°h, the latter commander being taken prisoner and forced to pay a heavy ransom. P√≠l√°ji, finding Gujar√°t an easy prey, made frequent incursions, and taking Songa·∏ç in the extreme south-east established himself there. M√≠hr √Åli Kh√°n, who had been acting for N√°hir Kh√°n, marched against and subdued the Kolis, who were committing piracy in the Mahi estuary. ;Decay of Imperial Power, 1720. From 1720, Mughal rule in Gujar√°t was doomed. P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r was established at Songa·∏ç, and in the anarchy that ensued, the great Gujar√°t houses of the B√°bis and Jh√°loris, as well as the newly arrived Mom√≠n Kh√°n, turned their thoughts to independence. Aj√≠tsingh so hated Mughal rule that he secretly favoured the Mar√°th√°s, and strove to establish his own authority over such portions of Gujar√°t as bordered on M√°rw√°r. In after years, Sarbuland Kh√°n made a vigorous attempt to reassert Mughal dominion, but the seeds of dissolution were sown and efforts at recovery were vain. In 1720, Aj√≠tsingh the viceroy sent Anopsingh Bhand√°ri to Gujar√°t as his deputy. In this year Niz√°m-ul-Mulk, viceroy of Ujjain, was superseded by Sayad Dil√°war Kh√°n. While Dil√°war Kh√°n was yet on the M√°lwa frontiers the Niz√°m desirous of possessing himself of the Dakhan (Deccan) and its resources retired to burhanpur pursued by Sayad Dil√°war Kh√°n, who giving battle was killed, the Niz√°m retiring to Aurangabad in the Dakhan. √Ålam √Åli Kh√°n, deputy viceroy of the Dakhan, was directed to march against him, while from north Gujar√°t Anopsingh Bhand√°ri was ordered to send 10,000 horse to Surat, and N√°hir Kh√°n, the deputy viceroy, was instructed to proceed thither in person. The Niz√°m and √Ålam √Åli Kh√°n met near B√°l√°pur in the Ber√°rs and a battle was fought in which the Niz√°m was successful and √Ålam Kh√°n was slain. At this time Anopsingh Bhand√°ri committed many oppressive acts, of which the chief was the murder of Kapurchand Bhans√°li, the leading merchant of √Åhmed√°b√°d. The cause of Kapurchand's murder was that he had hired a number of armed retainers who used to oppose the Bhand√°ri's orders and set free people unjustly imprisoned by him. To remove this meddler from his way the Bhand√°ri got him assassinated. ;Niz√°m-ul-Mulk Prime Minister, of the Empire, 1721 In 1721, Niz√°m-ul-Mulk was appointed prime minister of the empire, Abd√∫l Ham√≠d Kh√°n was recalled from Sorath, and in his stead Asad Kuli Kh√°n, with the title of Amir-ul-Umara, was appointed governor of Sorath and sent Muhammad Shar√≠f Kh√°n into Sorath as his deputy. Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n, Fiftieth Viceroy, 1721‚Äì22 In 1721, in conjunction with Muhammad Am√≠n and Sa√°dat Kh√°n, Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n freed the emperor from the tyranny of the Sayads, and was rewarded with the title of Mu√Æz-ud-daulah Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n Bah√°dur Zafar Jang and the viceroyalty of Gujar√°t. He obtained the appointment of minister for his brother Ja√¢far K√∫li Kh√°n. Ma√¢s√∫m K√∫li Kh√°n was dignified by the title of Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n Bah√°dur and appointed deputy viceroy. Disorder in √Åhmed√°b√°d, 1721 As soon as this change was notified, the people of √Åhmed√°b√°d, who were discontented with the rule of Anopsingh Bhandari, attacked his palace, the Bhadra, and he escaped with difficulty. In consequence of the enmity between Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n and the M√°rw√°ris, Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n, the deputy viceroy, attacked the house of N√°hir Kh√°n who had been Aj√≠tsingh's minister, and forced him to pay Rupees 100000 and leave the city. Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n next interfered with the lands of Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, the deputy governor of Godhra, and his brothers. On one of the brothers repairing to Delhi and remonstrating, Haidar K√∫li, restored their lands to the B√°bis. In consequence of this decision ill-feeling sprung up between Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n and the B√°bis, and when Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n went to exact tribute he forced Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, governor of Kaira (Kheda district), to pay a special fine of Rupees 10000. Shortly after one of the viceroy's officers, K√°s√≠m √Åli Kh√°n, while employed against the Kolis of that part of the country, was killed at Pethapur. Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n advanced, and revenged K√°s√≠m √Åli's death by burning the town. Next, he passed into Sorath, and after exacting tribute, crossed to Kutch. The chief opposed him, and in the fight that followed was beaten and forced to pay about Rupees 225000. In 1721, a Sayad was sent to Sorath as deputy governor in place of Muhammad Shar√≠f, and Haidar K√∫li was appointed governor of Kadi, the Ch√∫nv√°l, and Halvad (called Muhammadnagar), and put in charge of Tharad, Arjanpur, Bh√°mn√°rli, Peth√°pur, and Kheralu in place of Vakhatsingh, son of the Mah√°r√°ja Aj√≠tsingh. Early in 1722, Niz√°m-ul-Mulk took up the office of prime minister of the empire, to which he had been appointed in the previous year. Strenuous efforts were made to embroil him with Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n, as the Niz√°m's austerity and craft were a source of not less anxiety to the Dehli court than Haidar K√∫li's more daring and restless ambition. Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n, unable to contend with the Niz√°m, left Dehli and retired to Gujar√°t. On his way the villagers of Dabh√°li opposed him killing one of his chief men named Alif Beg Kh√°n. Haidar burned the village and put all the people to death, a severity which caused such terror that throughout his rule no difficulty was experienced in realizing tribute or in keeping the roads safe. About this time, among other changes, Muhammad Bah√°d√∫r, son of Sal√°bat Kh√°n B√°bi, was placed in charge of S√°dra and Virpur, with the title of Sher Kh√°n. Shortly after his arrival the viceroy marched against and subdued the rebellious Kolis of the Chunv√°l, appointing Rustam √Åli Kh√°n his governor there. Then, returning to √Åhmed√°b√°d, he took up his residence in the Bhadra. Shows signs of Independence and is Recalled, 1722. At this time Haidar K√∫li aimed at bringing all Gujar√°t under his rule. He seized the imperial horses which passed through √Åhmed√°b√°d on their way to Delhi, and confiscated many estates and gave them to his own men. On his way to enforce tribute from the Dungarp√∫r chiefs, he levied Rupees 80,000 from Lunavada. Through the mediation of the Udaipur R√°na, and as he agreed to pay a tribute of Rupees 100000, the R√°val of Dungarpur escaped. Haidar K√∫li next proceeded to Vijapur, north of √Åhmed√°b√°d, but hearing that the emperor was displeased at his assumption of the power of giving and changing grants of land, he returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d and restored several estates which he had confiscated. Niz√°m-ul-Mulk, Fifty-first Viceroy, 1722 As the emperor continued to distrust Haidar K√∫li Khan for his act to be free, and at the close of 1722 appointed Jumlat-ul-Mulk Niz√°m-ul- Mulk fifty-first viceroy. Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n, finding himself no match for the Niz√°m, was induced to retire quietly, and accordingly left Gujar√°t by way of Dungarpur. Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n and Rustam √Åli Kh√°n accompanied him as far as Dungarp√∫r, and then returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. In the meantime the Niz√°m had reached Ujjain, and then directed Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi to carry on the government till he should arrive, appointing at the same time his uncle H√°mid Kh√°n as deputy viceroy and Fidwi Kh√°n as minister. Subsequently, the Niz√°m came to Gujar√°t and chose officers of his own for places of trust, the chief of whom was Mom√≠n Kh√°n, who was appointed governor of Surat. The Niz√°m then returned to Delhi, but, after a short time, disgusted with his treatment at court, he retired to the Dakhan (Deccan), where, making Hyderabad his capital, he gradually began to act as an independent ruler. Meanwhile, in Gujar√°t dissensions sprang up between H√°mid Kh√°n and other officers, but matters were arranged without any outbreak of hostility. Tribute was exacted from the chiefs on the banks of the Vatrak river and from Modhera an unruly Koli village was burned down, and garrisons were placed in the Koli country. In 1723 Rustam √Åli Kh√°n and Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n were ordered from Delhi to march on Jodhpur, which they captured and plundered, and then returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. ;Marathas return In 1723, Pil√°ji G√°ikw√°r, who had been long hovering on the frontier, marched on Surat and was opposed by Mom√≠n Kh√°n, whom he defeated. After levying contributions from the surrounding country, he returned to his headquarters at Songad, and from this overran a considerable portion of the Surat territory, building several forts in the R√°jp√≠pla country. At the same time K√°nt√°ji Kadam B√°nde, invading Gujar√°t from the side of Dahod, began to levy fixed contributions. Though before this occasional demands had often been made, 1723 was the first year in which the Mar√°th√°s imposed a regular tribute on Gujar√°t. Mom√≠n Kh√°n was now appointed provincial minister, and Rustam √Åli Kh√°n succeeded him as revenue officer of Surat. Sarbuland Khan, Fifty- second Viceroy, 1723‚Äì1730 As Niz√°m had gone to the Dakhan without the emperor's leave, Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk Sarbuland Khan Bah√°dur Dil√°war Jang was appointed fifty-second viceroy of Gujar√°t. He selected Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n as his deputy, and made other arrangements for the government of the province. H√°mid Kh√°n, uncle and deputy of the Niz√°m, prepared to oppose Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n, but through the intervention of B√°bis Sal√°bat Kh√°n, Safdar Kh√°n, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, H√°mid Kh√°n evacuated the Bhadra, and withdrew to Dahod. Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n now went to collect tribute, leaving Ibr√°h√≠m K√∫li Kh√°n at √Åhmed√°b√°d, while R√°mr√°i was posted at Mahudha in Kaira, with orders to watch the movements of H√°mid Kh√°n. As the viceroy was in need of money, he farmed to one J√≠van Jugal the districts of Jambusar, Makb√∫l√°bad or Amod about twenty-two miles north of Bharuch, Dholka, and Bharuch. In 1724, he came to √Åhmed√°b√°d with √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n father of the author of the Mir√°t-i-√Åhmedi, as his private minister. Rustam √Åli, governor of Surat, having succeeded twice or thrice in defeating the Mar√°th√°s under P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r, now offered, in conjunction with his brother Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n, that if 20,000 men were placed under their orders, they would march against the Niz√°m. The emperor accepted this offer, allowing Rustam √Åli to draw on the Surat treasury to the extent of Rupees 200000. Rustam √Åli accordingly, with the aid of √Åhmed K√∫li his brother's son, equipped an army. In the meantime the Niz√°m was not idle. He promised to K√°nt√°ji Kadam B√°nde a one-fourth share of the revenue of Gujar√°t, provided he should be able, in concert with H√°mid Kh√°n, to re-conquer the province from Mub√°riz-ul- Mulk. Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n, who was now at Kadi, instead of following the advice of his minister and carefully watching H√°mid Kh√°n's movements from Kapadvanj, went to a distant part of the province. H√°mid Kh√°n seeing his opportunity, united his forces with those of K√°nt√°ji Kadam, and marched to Kapadvanj. Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n hearing of this, advanced towards √Åhmed√°b√°d and encamped at Dabhoda near √Åhmed√°b√°d and then proceeded to Mota Medra, about six miles east of the capital. When he came so near √Åhmed√°b√°d, many of his soldiers went without leave into the city to visit their families. The Mar√°th√°s attacked his rear guard, and his men giving way took to flight. H√°mid Kh√°n seeing that Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n had but a small force, marched between him and the capital. A battle was fought, in which Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n was slain, and his two sons Hasan K√∫li and Mustafa K√∫li were taken prisoners. Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n's head was cut off and sent to Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, to be sent to Ibr√°h√≠m K√∫li his son, who was doing duty as commandant at √Åhmed√°b√°d. H√°mid Kh√°n took up his quarters in and got possession of all √Åhmed√°b√°d except the city. H√°mid Kh√°n now sent a message to the emperor, that the Mar√°th√°s had been successful in defeating Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n and conquering Gujar√°t, but that he had defended √Åhmed√°b√°d against them. The emperor sent him a dress of honour, but after a few days discovered that H√°mid's message was false. The Mar√°th√°s now marched through the country, collecting their chauth or one-fourth and their sardeshmukhi or one-tenth shares of the revenue. K√°nt√°ji went to Viramgam and besieged the town, but on the promise of one of the chief inhabitants to raise a sum of Rupees 350000, the Mar√°th√°s retired. H√°mid Kh√°n who was now independent began to bestow lands and districts many of which remained with the grantees and were never recovered by future governors. Ibr√°h√≠m K√∫li, son of Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n, in revenge for his father's death, determined to assassinate H√°mid Kh√°n. The attempt failed. H√°mid Kh√°n escaped and Ibr√°h√≠m K√∫li was slain. ;Battle of Ar√°s Rustam √Åli Kh√°n, governor of Surat, in the hope of being revenged on H√°mid Kh√°n, invited the aid of P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r, and it was agreed that they should meet on the north bank of the Narmada River. P√≠l√°ji promised to aid Rustam Kh√°n, and the allied armies, crossing the Mahi river, encamped at Aras in the plain between Anand Anand and the Mahi. H√°mid Kh√°n, accompanied by M√≠r Nathu, Muhammad Sal√°bat Rohila, and K√°nt√°ji Kadam, marched to oppose Rustam Kh√°n. H√°mid Kh√°n also entered into secret negotiations with P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r, who resolved to remain neutral and side with the conqueror. A battle was fought, in which, though Pil√°ji took no part, H√°mid Kh√°n was defeated and put to flight, and M√≠r Nathu was killed. After the fight Rustam √Åli remained on the field of battle and liberated his nephews, plundering H√°mid Kh√°n's camp. P√≠l√°ji plundered Rustam √Åli's camp and then moved off, while K√°nt√°ji carried away what was left in the camp of H√°mid Kh√°n. H√°mid Kh√°n reproached K√°nt√°ji for his inactivity; but he pleaded in excuse that he was watching the mode of warfare amongst Mughals, and promised to attack Rustam √Åli shortly. Now, as the Mar√°th√°s really desired to ruin Rustam √Åli, who was their bitter foe, they after a few days surrounded him and cut off his supplies. Rustam √Åli stood a blockade of eight days, and then forced his way through his enemies and went to N√°p√°d, (about fourteen miles west of the V√°sad railway station in the Anand district), and then through Kalamsar to N√°pa or N√°ba under Petlad. The Mar√°th√°s still pursuing Rustam √Åli retired to Vasu under Petl√°d where he gave battle, and by a furious charge broke the Mar√°tha line. The Mar√°th√°s rallied, and Rustam √Åli and his men were defeated, Rustam √Åli being slain and his nephews again taken prisoners. Rustam was buried on the field of battle and his head sent to √Åhmed√°b√°d. H√°mid Kh√°n returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d with the Mar√°th√°s, who saw that their only means of effecting a permanent footing in the province was by supporting him. H√°mid Kh√°n then assigned a one-fourth share of the revenue of the territory north of the Mahi to K√°nt√°ji, and to P√≠l√°ji a corresponding interest in the territory south of the Mahi, including Surat and Baroda. After this H√°mid Kh√°n acted tyrannically. He extorted large sums from the rich, and poisoned the two sons of Shuj√°√¢t Kh√°n. When the news of K√°nt√°ji's and P√≠l√°ji's success reached the Dakhan, Trimbak Rao Dabhade, son of Khander√°v Sen√°pati, came with a large army and laid siege to Cambay. While the siege was being pressed a quarrel among the Mar√°tha leaders culminated in strife and bloodshed. Trimbak Rao was wounded or killed and the Mar√°tha army had to disperse and retire. ;Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk recaptures the province from Hamid Khan and the Mar√°th√°s, 1725. Sal√°bat Kh√°n, leaving √Åhmed√°b√°d, went to V√≠ramg√°m, and after some time, placing his nephew at V√≠ramg√°m, he went into Gohilwad. When the news of the defeat and death of Rustam √Åli reached Delhi, the emperor ordered Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk to take a strong army and proceed in person to Gujar√°t and expel H√°mid Kh√°n and the Mar√°th√°s. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk marched on Gujar√°t with a large army, assisted by Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh of Jodhpur, Chatarsingh R√°ja of Narwar in Bundelkhand, Gandrapsingh, and the Mah√°r√°na of Udaipur. On his arrival at Ajmer, Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk was received by his private minister √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n, who afterwards joined Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi in R√°dhanpur, and united their troops with those under Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk. At that time Sal√°bat Kh√°n was removed from his government, and Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi died. In obedience to the imperial order, Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk marched from Ajmer and came to the Gujar√°t frontier. On his approach H√°mid Kh√°n returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. He placed R√∫psingh and Sard√°r Muhammad Ghorni in charge of the city and himself withdrew to Mehm√∫d√°b√°d. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk now sent Sheikh Al√≠y√°r in advance with an army against √Åhmed√°b√°d. When Sheikh Al√≠y√°r arrived before the city, Muhammad Ghorni, who was dissatisfied with H√°mid Kh√°n for bringing in the Mar√°th√°s, persuaded R√∫psingh to fly. In the meantime Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk with the main body of his forces reached Sidhpur. H√°mid Kh√°n, accompanied by a detachment of Mar√°tha horse, now returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d; but Muhammad Ghorni closed the gates, and would not suffer him to enter the city. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk marched to Mehsana. About this time √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n, the father of the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi, who was now with Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk at Mehs√°na, advised him to conciliate the influential family of B√°bi. Under his advice, Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi was appointed governor of V√≠ramg√°m, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n governor of P√°tan. Shortly afterwards Murlidhard√°s, the Gujar√°ti minister of H√°mid Kh√°n, deserted his master's declining cause. When Kant√°ji heard that Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk had arrived at Peth√°pur, only eighteen miles from √Åhmed√°b√°d, he retired to Mehm√∫d√°b√°d. Before the close of 1725, Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk reached √Åhmed√°b√°d, where he was well received by the officials and merchants. H√°mid Kh√°n and Kant√°ji, who had by this time reached the banks of the Mahi river, were now joined by P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r. The Mar√°tha leaders, seeing that the only way to preserve their footing in the province was to espouse the cause of H√°mid Kh√°n, united their forces with his, and prepared to march on √Åhmed√°b√°d. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk deputed his son Kh√°nahz√°d Kh√°n with an army to oppose them, and made several appointments, among other changes raising √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n to the post of minister. ;Defeat of the Mar√°th√°s at Sojitra and Kapadvanj, 1725 Kh√°nahz√°d Kh√°n met the Mar√°th√°s near Sojitra, about ten miles north-west of Petl√°d, and defeated them, pursuing them as far as the Mahi. Then, returning, he was reinforced by his brother Sh√°h Naw√°z Kh√°n, and marched against the Mar√°th√°s, who were encamped at Kapadvanj. Another battle was fought, and the Mar√°th√°s were again defeated and pursued as far as the hills of √Åli-Mohan now Chhota Udaipur in the extreme east of the province. Kh√°nahz√°d Kh√°n now appointed Hasan-ud-d√≠n governor of Baroda, Bharuch, Jambusar, and Makbul√°b√°d. ;Mar√°tha Expedition against Vadnagar, 1725 Meanwhile, Ant√°ji Bh√°skar, a Mar√°tha noble, entering Gujar√°t from the side of Idar, laid siege to the town of Vadnagar, which, according to the old Gujar√°t proverb, with Umreth in the Kaira district, are the two golden feathers of the kingdom of Gujar√°t. Vadnagar was inhabited by wealthy Br√°hmans of the N√°gar caste who prayed Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk to march to their relief; but as both his sons were in pursuit of the other Mar√°tha bands defeated at Kapadvanj, the viceroy had no troops to spare from the √Åhmed√°b√°d garrison. The N√°gars accordingly, seeing no prospect of help, paid a sum of Rupees 400000 and Ant√°ji Bh√°skar retired. Kant√°ji and P√≠l√°ji, encouraged by this raid of Ant√°ji's, entered Gujar√°t from different quarters. K√°nt√°ji again laid siege to Vadnagar. The N√°gars, unable to pay the contribution demanded, leaving their property fled and K√°nt√°ji in his attempts to unearth the buried treasure burned down the town. Shortly afterwards Umreth in the Kaira district suffered a similar fate at the hands of K√°nt√°ji. In one of his raids P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r advancing as far as Baroda was met by Kh√°nahz√°d Kh√°n, the son of the viceroy. Distrusting the issue of a battle P√≠l√°ji fled to Cambay, and from Cambay withdrew to Sorath. For these services the emperor raised Kh√°nahz√°d Kh√°n to the rank of a noble, with the title Gh√°lib Jang. About this time √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n was dismissed from the post of minister, and in his stead first Muhammad Sayad Beg and afterwards Muhammad Sulaim√°n were appointed. Not long afterwards √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n was again entrusted with a command and raised to be governor of Dholka. The Mar√°th√°s retired to the Dakhan, but, returning in 1726, compelled Mub√°riz-ul- Mulk to confirm his predecessor's grants in their favour. The emperor refused to acknowledge any cessions of revenue to the Mar√°th√°s; and the viceroy, hard pressed for money, unable to obtain support from the court and receiving little help from his impoverished districts, was forced to impose fresh taxes on the citizens of √Åhmed√°b√°d, and at the same time to send an army to collect their tribute from the Mahi chiefs. As part of the agreement between Mub√°riz- ul-Mulk and the Mar√°tha chiefs P√≠l√°ji was to receive a share in the revenue of the districts south of the Mahi. But Peshwa Bajirao Bal√°l, to whom, as agent of his rival Khander√°v D√°bh√°de, P√≠l√°ji was obnoxious, sent Ud√°ji Pav√°r to drive P√≠l√°ji away. In this Ud√°ji was successful, and defeating P√≠l√°ji forced him to seek the aid of K√°nt√°ji. K√°nt√°ji, perceiving that if the Peshwa became supreme his own independence would suffer, joined P√≠l√°ji, and marching together upon Baroda they endeavoured, but without success, to prevent the Mughal governor Sadr-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n from entering the city. About this time want of funds forced Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk to sell the greater part of the Dholka district to different landholders. In the following year, 1727, B√°jir√°v Peshwa began to negotiate with Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk, undertaking that if the one-fourth and one-tenth shares in the revenue of the province were guaranteed to him, he would protect Gujar√°t from other invaders. Though he did not consent to these proposals, the viceroy so far accepted the alliance of the Peshwa as to allow the governor of Baroda to aid Ud√°ji Pav√°r against P√≠l√°ji. ;Pil√°ji G√°ikw√°r obtains Baroda and Dabhoi, 1727. Pil√°ji and K√°nt√°ji outman≈ìuvred Ud√°ji and prevented him from effecting a junction with the governor of Baroda, who in the end was forced to abandon both that city and the stronghold of Dabhoi, while Ud√°ji retired to M√°lwa. P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r now obtained possession of Baroda. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk, still sorely pressed for funds, marched into Sorath to exact tribute. On reaching V√≠ramg√°m, Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, on behalf of the J√°m of Naw√°nagar, presented the viceroy with Rupees 100000, and for this service was rewarded with the gift of an elephant. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk then marched against Chh√°ya, the capital of the chief of Porbandar in the south- west of K√°thi√°wad. This chief, by putting to sea, hoped to escape the payment of tribute. But on hearing that the viceroy proposed to annex his territory and appoint an officer to govern it, he returned and agreed to pay a tribute of Rupees 40,000. On his way back to √Åhmed√°b√°d, Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk passed through Halvad in Jh√°l√°v√°·∏ça, and there married the daughter of Jh√°la Prat√°psingh, the chief of that district, whom he accordingly exempted from the payment of tribute. About this time the viceroy received orders from the emperor to restore certain land which he had confiscated, and as he neglected to obey, certain estates of his in the Panj√°b were resumed. ;Capture of Ch√°mp√°ner by the Mar√°th√°s, 1728. In the meantime Krishn√°ji, foster son of K√°nt√°ji, made a sudden attack upon Champaner and captured that fortress, and from that time K√°nt√°ji's agents remained permanently in Gujar√°t to collect his share of the tribute. In 1728 the minister Mom√≠n Kh√°n died, and in his place the emperor selected Mom√≠n Kh√°n's brother Abd-ul-Ghani Kh√°n. About this time Asad √Åli, governor of Jun√°ga·∏çh, also died, and on his deathbed appointed Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, deputy governor of that fortress. Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n sent his son Sher Kh√°n B√°bi to act on his behalf. When the emperor heard of the death of Asad √Åli, he appointed Ghul√°m Muhy-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, son of the late Asad √Åli, governor. Ghul√°m Muhy-ud-d√≠n did not proceed to Jun√°ga·∏çh but continued Sher Kh√°n B√°bi as his deputy perceiving that neither P√≠l√°ji nor K√°nt√°ji afforded any protection to Gujar√°t, but rather pillaged it, closed with the offers of B√°jir√°v Peshwa, and in 1729 formally granted to him the one-fourth and one-tenth shares of the revenue of the province. The Peshwa accordingly sent his brother Chimn√°jir√°v to collect the tribute. Chimn√°ji plundered Dholka and the country near Ch√°mp√°ner, while Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk exacted tribute from the chiefs on the banks of the Vatrak river. K√°nt√°ji now entered Gujar√°t and prepared for war in case Chimn√°ji and the viceroy should unite against him. His movements were not interfered with, and after collecting his share of the tribute, he retired to Sorath. The viceroy now marched against the Kolis, and after destroying many of them together with their wives and children, returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d by way of Modasa and Ahmednagar (Himatnagar). Ghul√°m Muhy-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, governor of Jun√°ga·∏çh, who had not yet proceeded to his command, appointed a second deputy. Through the influence of the viceroy this appointment was not confirmed, and instead Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, son of Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n, was placed in charge of that fortress. ;Mulla Muhammad √Åli raises a Disturbance at Surat, 1729 In Surat, the year 1729, was marked by a severe flood in the Tapti river and by a somewhat serious local disturbance. The chief cause of the disturbance was Mulla Muhammad √Åli, a rich Muslim trader of Surat. This man who, as √õmda-tut-tujj√°r or chief of the merchants, had already a special rank in the city, was tempted to take advantage of the disorders of the time to raise himself to the position of an independent ruler. With this object, he chose as his headquarters the Piram Island in the Gulf of Cambay, near the port of Ghogha, and there spent considerable sums in strengthening the island and tempting settlers to place themselves under his protection. As P√≠ram was not popular, Mulla Muhammad fixed on the village of Athwa, on the left bank of the T√°pti, about twelve miles from its mouth. Here he began to build a fort, but was ordered to desist by Sohr√°b Kh√°n, the governor of Surat, from which city the proposed stronghold was only three miles distant. Mulla Muhammad so far from obeying, persuaded Beglar-Beg Kh√°n the commander of the fort of Surat to side with him. Accordingly, next day, Beglar-Beg Kh√°n bombarded the governor Sohr√°b Kh√°n's residence, proclaiming that his own brother Teghbeg Kh√°n was appointed governor of Surat. In the end, Mulla Muhammad √Åli induced the chief merchants of the city to pray for the removal of Sohr√°b who pending receipt of orders from the emperor was made to hand over his official residence in the city to Teghbeg Kh√°n. ;Na·∏çi√°d given in Farm, 1729. In the same year, 1729, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi was chosen governor of Petlad, √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n was made collector of √Åhmed√°b√°d, and √Åli Muhammad's son, the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi and his brother were appointed governor and superintendent of the customs of that district. √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n shortly resigned and was succeeded by R√∫-√≠n Kh√°n. At this time Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi, while punishing the Kolis of B√°lor, probably Bh√°tod about fifteen miles east of Bharuch, was killed by a man of that tribe, and in revenge for his death the town of B√°lor was plundered. On the death of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, at the request of Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, his eldest son Kam√°l- ud-d√≠n Kh√°n B√°bi received the districts of Sami and Munjpur and the title of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n. At the same time the second son, Muhammad Anwar, with the title of Safdar Kh√°n, was appointed to the government of Radhanpur. The viceroy now went to Na·∏çi√°d, where R√°i Kishand√°s, agent of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, received the district of Petl√°d in farm. From Na·∏çi√°d, Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk went to collect tribute from Sar·∏ç√°rsingh, the chief of Bhadarva in the Rewa K√°ntha about fifteen miles north of Baroda, on the banks of the Mahi river, who, after some fighting, agreed to pay a sum of Rs. 20000. On his way back to √Åhmed√°b√°d the viceroy levied tribute from the chief of Umeta, fifteen miles west of Baroda. As R√°i Kishand√°s failed to pay the sum agreed on for the farm of Petl√°d, an order was issued for his imprisonment. To save himself from the indignity he committed suicide. ;Athva Fort, 1730 When K√°nt√°ji returned from Sorath he camped at Sanand, and his advanced guard carried off some of the viceroy's elephants which were grazing there. Men were sent in pursuit, but in vain, and the Mar√°th√°s escaped. Meanwhile, at Surat, Mulla Muhammad √Åli continued to build the fort at Athva. At last his accomplice, Beglar-Beg Kh√°n the commander of the Surat fort, began to perceive that if the Athva fort were completed the Mulla would be in a position to obstruct the trade of the port of Surat. He consequently ordered him to stop building. In spite of this the Mulla succeeded in persuading Sohr√°b Kh√°n to allow him to go on with his fort promising in return to get him confirmed as governor of Surat. Sohr√°b Kh√°n agreed, and the fort was completed, and Sohr√°b Kh√°n was duly appointed governor. As the fort was immediately below Surat the revenue of Surat was greatly diminished, and Sohr√°b Kh√°n, when it was too late, saw his mistake. ;The Viceroy in K√°thi√°v√°·∏ça and Kutch, 1730 In 1730, Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk went into Gohilwad in south-east Kathiawad and levied tribute from Bh√°vsingh, chief of Sihor; then he proceeded to M√°dhupur, a town under Porbandar, and laid it waste. While engaged at M√°dhupur, Mom√≠n Kh√°n, son-in-law of the late Mom√≠n Kh√°n, owing to some misunderstanding with the viceroy suddenly set out for √Åhmed√°b√°d and from √Åhmed√°b√°d proceeded to √Ågra. The viceroy now marched in the direction of Kutch and refusing the offer of a yearly tribute of about 10,00,000 mahm√∫dis, advanced against Bhuj. He experienced great difficulty in crossing the Rann of Kutch, and as the R√°o had cut off all supplies, and as at the same time news arrived of disturbances in √Åhmed√°b√°d, he was obliged, after a month and a half, to retire to R√°dhanpur. ;Riots at √Åhmed√°b√°d The author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi was ordered to suppress the √Åhmed√°b√°d riots, which had arisen out of the levy of some fresh taxes, and was invested with the title of Hasan Muhammad Kh√°n. In this year Udaikaran, Des√°i of V√≠ramg√°m, was murdered by a Kasb√°ti of that town named √Åli, and Sal√°b√°t Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, who was sent to investigate this murder, died on his way at Paldi, a village on the right bank of the S√°barmati opposite to √Åhmed√°b√°d. Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh, Fifty-third Viceroy, 1730‚Äì1733 In 1730, Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh of Jodhpur was appointed viceroy and had reached Palanpur. The friends of order endeavoured to arrange a peaceable transfer between the Mah√°r√°ja and the late viceroy, but Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk determined to try the chances of war, and prepared for resistance. At this time M√≠r Ism√°√≠l, deputy of Ghul√°m Muhy-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, arrived and took charge of the government of Jun√°ga·∏çh from Sher Kh√°n B√°bi. Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh, after making various appointments, set out with his brother Vakhatsingh and 20,000 men to take over the government of Gujar√°t. When he reached P√°lanpur and saw that Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk was determined on resistance, he sent an order to Sard√°r Muhammad Ghorni appointing him his minister and directing him to take possession of the city of √Åhmed√°b√°d and drive out the late viceroy. As Sard√°r Muhammad was not strong enough to carry out these orders he awaited the Mah√°r√°ja's arrival. When the Mah√°r√°ja reached Sidhpur he was joined by Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi from Radhanpur. They then advanced together to Adalaj, distant only about eight miles from Ahmedabad, their army increasing daily. ;Battle of Ad√°laj (1730) and Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk defeated Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk was already encamped between Ad√°laj and the city, and on the approach of the Mah√°r√°ja a battle was fought in which the Mah√°r√°ja was defeated. Abheysingh changed his position, and another and bloodier engagement took place, in which both sides tried to kill the opposing commander. But as both Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk and the Mah√°r√°ja fought disguised as common soldiers, neither party succeeded. At first the Mah√°r√°ja who had the advantage in position repulsed the enemy, but Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk fought so desperately in the river-bed that the R√°tho·∏çs gave way. They rallied and made one more desperate charge, but were met, repulsed, and finally pursued as far as Sarkhej. The Mah√°r√°ja, who had not expected so determined an opposition, now sent Mom√≠n Kh√°n and Amarsingh to negotiate with Mub√°riz-ul- Mulk, who was still determined to resist to the uttermost. It was finally agreed that Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk should receive a sum of Rupees 1 lakh and should surrender √Åhmed√°b√°d to the Mah√°r√°ja. Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk accordingly quitted the city and left for Agra by way of Udaipur. The Mah√°r√°ja entering √Åhmed√°b√°d, appointed Ratansingh Bhand√°ri his deputy, and placed Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, cousin of Mom√≠n Kh√°n, in charge of the city police. Shortly afterwards Kar√≠md√°d Kh√°n Jh√°lori, governor of P√°lanpur, who had accompanied the Mah√°r√°ja into Gujar√°t, died. After the death of Sal√°bat Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi, his son, Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, was dismissed from the government of Jun√°ga·∏çh. He retired to his estate of Ghogha, and when the Mah√°r√°ja arrived in √Åhmed√°b√°d he paid his respects, presenting the viceroy with an elephant and some horses. The Mah√°r√°ja confirmed the lands assigned to his father, and reported his action to the emperor. ;Mom√≠n Kh√°n Ruler of Cambay, 1730 Mom√≠n Kh√°n was made ruler of Cambay, and Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, his cousin, was made governor of the lands near that city, the revenue of which had been assigned to the Mah√°r√°ja. So great was the fear of the Mar√°th√°s, that Mustaf√≠d Kh√°n, the governor elect of Surat, instead of proceeding direct by land, went to Cambay. From Cambay he moved to Bharuch, and from Bharuch entered into negotiations with P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r, promising, if allowed to retain possession of Surat, to pay P√≠l√°ji the one- fourth share of its revenues. P√≠l√°ji agreed, but Sohr√°b Kh√°n, who was still in possession of Surat, refused to hand it over to Mustaf√≠d Kh√°n. In this year also Vakhatsingh, brother of the Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh, was appointed governor of P√°tan, and sent a deputy to act for him. About the same time M√≠r Fakhr-ud- d√≠n, a follower of the late viceroy Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk, leaving him secretly, came to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and in an interview with the Mah√°r√°ja obtained for himself the post of deputy governor of Jun√°ga·∏çh. When he proceeded to take up his appointment he was opposed by M√≠r Ism√°√≠l, and was killed in a battle fought near Amreli. Muhammad Pah√°r, son of Kar√≠md√°d Kh√°n Jh√°lori, was appointed governor of P√°lanpur in succession to his father, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was sent to Vadnagar. ;The Peshwa and Viceroy against Pil√°ji G√°ikw√°r, 1731 In 1731, B√°jir√°v Peshwa, entering Gujar√°t at the head of an army, advanced against Baroda, then in the possession of P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r. Afterwards, at the invitation of the Mah√°r√°ja, he visited √Åhmed√°b√°d and had a meeting with the viceroy in the Sh√°hi B√°gh. At this meeting it was agreed that B√°jir√°v should assist √Åzmatull√°h, the governor of Baroda, in taking possession of that town and in expelling P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r. By this arrangement the viceroy hoped by playing off the Peshwa against P√≠l√°ji, to succeed in getting rid of the latter, while the Peshwa intended that if P√≠l√°ji was forced to give up Baroda, he himself should gain possession of that city. Accordingly, the Peshwa, together with an army from the viceroy, marched on Baroda. They had scarcely laid siege to the city when the Peshwa heard that Niz√°m-ul-Mulk was advancing on Gujar√°t against him. Abandoning all operations against Baroda, the Peshwa withdrew, with all speed, to the Dakhan. On his way he encountered the army of Trimbakr√°v Sen√°pati, who, together with Pil√°ji K√°nt√°ji and Ud√°ji Pav√°r, had united to resist the pretensions of the Peshwa in Gujar√°t, and were also secretly leagued with the Niz√°m. An engagement was fought in which the Peshwa was victorious and Trimbakr√°v was slain. The Peshwa at once pushed on to the Dakhan, contriving to avoid the Niz√°m, though his baggage was plundered by that chief, who had camped at Ghala Kamrej, on the river T√°pti, about ten miles above Surat. Abd√∫ll√°h Beg appointed the Niz√°m's Deputy at Broach. During these changes the city of Bharuch, which on account of the strength of its fort the Mar√°th√°s had failed to take, was governed by Abd√∫ll√°h Beg, an officer originally appointed to that command by Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk. Dissatisfied that the government of Gujar√°t should be in the hands of Abheysingh, Abd√∫ll√°h Beg, in 1731, entered into negotiations with the Niz√°m, offering to hold Bharuch as the Niz√°m's deputy. Niz√°m-ul-Mulk agreed, appointed Abd√∫ll√°h his deputy, and ennobled him with the title of Nek √Ålam Kh√°n. About the same time Vakhatsingh, brother of the viceroy, withdrew to his chiefship of N√°gor in Jodhpur, and √Åzmat-ull√°h went to √Ågra. After his safe arrival in the Dakhan B√°jir√°v Peshwa entered into an agreement with the Niz√°m under the terms of which the grants of Dholka, Bharuch, Jambusar, and Makb√∫l√°b√°d were continued to the Niz√°m. Mom√≠n Kh√°n received the farm of Petlad, and K√°nt√°ji was confirmed in the share he had acquired of the revenues of Gujar√°t. In 1732 the paymaster, Am√°natd√°r Kh√°n, died, and was succeeded by Ghul√°m Hasan Kh√°n, who sent Muj√°hid-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n to act as his deputy. Through the influence of Mulla Muhammad Ali, Sohr√°b √Åli was now confirmed as governor of Surat, and Mustaf√≠d Kh√°n was obliged to return to √Åhmed√°b√°d. P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r as the agent of the deceased Khander√°v D√°bh√°de Sen√°pati, as the owner of the fort of Songad, and as the ally of the Bh√≠ls and Kolis, was naturally a thorn in the side of the viceroy Abheysingh. The recent acquisition of the town of Baroda and of the strong fortress of Dabhoi had made Pil√°ji still more formidable. Under these circumstances, Abheysingh, who had long wished to recover Baroda and Dabhoi determined to assassinate Pil√°ji, and this was effected by a M√°rv√°di at the holy village of Dakor. The Mar√°th√°s slew the assassin and withdrew across the Mahi, burning the body of Pil√°ji at the village of Savli, fourteen miles north of Baroda. They then evacuated the district of Baroda, retiring to the fortress of Dabhoi. On hearing of the death of P√≠l√°ji, the viceroy immediately advanced against the Mar√°th√°s, and, after taking possession of Baroda, laid siege to Dabhoi. He failed to capture this fortress, and as the rainy season had set in and provisions were scarce, he was obliged to retire. He then went to Baroda, and after placing Sher Kh√°n B√°bi in charge of the city, returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. In 1732, Gujar√°t was wasted by famine. ;Affairs at Surat, 1732. Meanwhile, at Surat M√∫lla Muhammad Ali of Athva was again the cause of disturbance. Resisting with force the demand of a sum of Rupees 1 lakh by Sohr√°b Kh√°n, the governor of Surat, he succeeded in driving Sohr√°b Kh√°n out of the city, and the government of Surat was then usurped by Teghbeg Kh√°n, a brother of Beglar- Beg Kh√°n. The success of the M√∫lla against Sor√°b Kh√°n made him so forgetful of his position that he arrogated to himself all the emblems of the governor's office and wrote to the emperor asking a patent of the governorship of Surat in the name of his son M√∫lla Fakhr-ud-d√≠n. The messengers bearing these communications were intercepted at Broach by the partisans of Teghbeg, who determined to remove this powerful cause of anxiety. Teghbeg Kh√°n, inviting Muhammad Ali to an entertainment, placed him in confinement, and after keeping him in prison for two years, in 1734 put him to death. Teghbeg also took possession of the fort of Athva, and plundered it. Sohr√°b Kh√°n, seeing that he could not recover Surat, went with Sayad Wali to Ghogha, where his relatives lived, and from that, proceeding to Bhavnagar settled there. When the emperor heard what had happened, he appointed Mom√≠n Kh√°n to Surat and Teghbeg Kh√°n to Cambay. Mom√≠n Kh√°n sent Sayad N√∫rullah to act for him, but he was defeated by Teghbeg Kh√°n, who afterwards contrived, in 1733, to be formally appointed governor of Surat with the title of Bah√°dur. When Um√°b√°i, widow of Khander√°v Sen√°pati, heard of the assassination of P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r, she determined to avenge his death. Collecting an army and taking with her K√°nt√°ji Kadam and D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, son of P√≠l√°ji, she marched upon √Åhmed√°b√°d. As the Mar√°th√°s failed to do more than slay a R√°jput leader named J√≠var√°j they came to terms. In the end it was agreed that in addition to the one-fourth and the one-tenth shares of the revenue a sum of rupees 80,000 should be paid from the √Åhmed√°b√°d treasury, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n being kept as a hostage till the payments were made. For his services on this occasion Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was made governor of Viramgam. During this year an imperial order appointed Khush√°lchand Sheth, son of Shantidas Jhaveri, Nagar Sheth or chief merchant of √Åhmed√°b√°d. The Mar√°th√°s plundered Ras√∫l√°b√°d a mile south of √Åhmed√°b√°d and its excellent library was pillaged. Um√°b√°i now marched upon Baroda, and the governor, Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, prepared to oppose the Mar√°th√°s. But Um√°b√°i, sending a message to Sher Kh√°n, explained that she had just concluded a peace with the Mah√°r√°ja, and was suffered to pass unmolested. The emperor, satisfied with the arrangements made by the Mah√°r√°ja, presented him with a dress of honour. Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, Deputy Viceroy, 1733‚Äì1737 In this year the Mah√°r√°ja went to court by way of Jodhpur, and appointed Ratansingh Bhand√°ri as his deputy, and the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi as news recorder. In 1733, Ghul√°m Muhy-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, governor of Jun√°ga·∏çh died, and his son M√≠r Hazabr Kh√°n was selected to fill his place. Meanwhile, as the Mar√°th√°s had not received their rights, J√°doji D√°bh√°de, son of Um√°b√°i, returned to Gujar√°t. Peace was concluded on the former basis, and J√°doji marched into Sorath to exact tribute. In this year the Kolis of the Ch√∫nv√°l and K√°nkrej committed many excesses, and a R√°jput noble was robbed in the P√°tan district. In the meantime Sohr√°b Kh√°n, the former governor of Surat, who had been kindly received by Bh√°vsinghji, the chief of Sihor, began to raise a following and was appointed collector of arrears in Sorath. He chose Sayad N√∫rullah as his deputy, and sent him to recover the revenue for the current year. On the death of Sal√°bat Kh√°n B√°bi, though the Mah√°r√°ja had endeavoured to get Sher Kh√°n B√°bi appointed in place of his father, Ghogha had been granted to Burh√°n-ul-Mulk, who chose Sohr√°b Kh√°n as his deputy. At this time Sher Kh√°n B√°bi was at Baroda, and his younger brother, though he resisted, was compelled to leave Ghogha. The deputy governor of Sorath complained to the governor of the oppressive conduct of Sohr√°b Kh√°n. But Burh√°n-ul-Mulk supported Sohr√°b and having obtained for himself the government of Sorath, sent Sohr√°b Kh√°n as his deputy to Jun√°ga·∏çh. In 1734, Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, the deputy viceroy, ordered Bh√°vsingh, son of Udaikaran, the hereditary officer of V√≠ramg√°m, to be captured by Jaw√°n-Mard Kh√°n, imprisoned and sent him to √Åhmed√°b√°d. Jawan-Mard Kh√°n went so far as to arrest Bh√°vsingh, but was forced by his supporters to release him. ;Baroda recovered by the Mar√°th√°s, 1734 In 1734, Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, governor of Baroda, went to visit his lands at Balasinor, leaving Muhammad Sarb√°z in command at Baroda, M√°had√°ji G√°ikw√°r, brother of P√≠l√°ji, who then held Jamb√∫sar, sending to Songad to D√°m√°ji for aid, marched on Baroda with a strong force. The garrison made a brave defence, and Sher Kh√°n hearing of the attack at B√°l√°sinor, called for aid from Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, the deputy viceroy, who directed Mom√≠n Kh√°n, the governor of Cambay, to join Sher Kh√°n and drive back the Mar√°th√°s. Sher Kh√°n started at once for Baroda. But M√°hadaji leaving a sufficient force before the town pushed on with the bulk of his army to meet Sher Kh√°n, and, though he and his men fought bravely, defeated him, and then returned to Baroda, Sher Kh√°n retiring to B√°l√°sinor. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, who arrived after Sher Kh√°n's defeat, did not deem it prudent to engage the Mar√°th√°s, and retired to Cambay. In the meantime the garrison of Baroda, hopeless of succour, surrendered the town, and since that day Baroda continued to be the headquarters of the G√°ikw√°r family until independence of India in 1947. Since Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n's capture of Bh√°vsingh of V√≠ramg√°m, he had become much disliked. For this reason Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, the deputy viceroy, transferred him to Kadi and Vijapur, and in his place appointed Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, whose father Muhammad Sal√°b√°t Kh√°n B√°bi had been a popular governor of V√≠ramg√°m. At this time Dhanr√∫p Bhand√°ri, governor of Petl√°d, died, and the farm of the districts of Nadiad, Arhar-M√°tar, Petl√°d, and Mahudha was given to Mom√≠n Kh√°n. Mulla Muhammad √Åli managed to write letters from his confinement at Surat to the Niz√°m; and as that chief was now not far from Surat, he wrote urgently to Teghbeg Kh√°n to release him. Teghbeg Kh√°n put the Mulla to death, and bribing the Niz√°m's messenger, gave out that he had died of joy at his release. Khush√°lchand, the chief of the merchants of √Åhmed√°b√°d, having had a difference with Ratansingh, was forced to leave the city, and sought shelter at Cambay and afterwards at Jun√°ga·∏çh. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n conceived the design of conquering Idar from Anandsingh and R√°isingh, brothers of the Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh. He accordingly marched upon √çdar, taking with him as allies Aghr√°ji Koli of Katosan and Koli Amra of Ilol K√°nrah. In this strait Anandsingh and R√°isingh sought the aid of Malh√°rr√°v Holkar and R√°noji Sindia, who were at this time in M√°lwa. The Mar√°tha chiefs at once marched to the help of √çdar, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, disbelieving the report of Mar√°tha aid, continued to advance until he found himself opposed by an overwhelming force. Negotiations were entered into, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n agreed to pay a sum of Rupees 1,75,000. Of the total amount Rupees 25,000 were paid at once, and Zor√°war Kh√°n, brother of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, and Ajabsingh, agent of Aghr√°ji Koli, were kept as hostages until the balance should be paid. In this year Teghbeg Kh√°n of Surat caused a wealthy merchant named √Åhmed Chalabi to be assassinated, and confiscated his property. He also ordered Sayad √Åli to be put to death by certain Afgh√°ns. ;Rivalry of Ratansingh Bhand√°ri and Sohr√°b Kh√°n, 1735 In 1735, Dholka was assigned to Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, and through the influence of Burh√°n-ul-Mulk, Sohr√°b Kh√°n was appointed governor of V√≠ramg√°m. Ratansingh resented this, and eventually V√≠ramg√°m was conferred on the Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh. When this order reached Sohr√°b Kh√°n, he forwarded it to Burh√°n-ul-Mulk, and in consequence of Burh√°n-ul-Mulk's remonstrances, the arrangements were changed and Sohr√°b Kh√°n appointed governor. Upon this Sohr√°b Kh√°n, leaving S√°dak Ali as his deputy in Jun√°ga·∏çh, marched for V√≠ramg√°m; while Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, hearing of Sohr√°b Kh√°n's approach, summoned Mom√≠n Kh√°n and others to his assistance, and with his own army proceeded to Dholka and plundered Koth. From Koth he advanced and pitched at Harala, about ten miles from Sohr√°b Kh√°n's camp, and here he was joined by Mom√≠n Kh√°n and others whom he had summoned to support him. ;Battle of Dholi. Defeat and Death of Sohr√°b Kh√°n, 1735 After the union of these forces he marched to Dholi, six miles from Dhandhuka, at which place Sohr√°b Kh√°n was then encamped. Ratansingh Bhand√°ri now proposed that peace should be concluded, and that Sohr√°b Kh√°n should enjoy V√≠ramg√°m until final orders were passed by the emperor. Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi and others went to Sohr√°b Kh√°n and endeavoured to bring him to consent to these terms; but he would not listen, and on both sides preparations were made for battle. During the following night Ratansingh Bhand√°ri planned an attack on Sohr√°b Kh√°n's camp. The surprise was complete. Sohr√°b Kh√°n's troops fled, and himself, mortally wounded, shortly afterwards died. By the death of Sohr√°b Kh√°n the family of K√°z√≠m Beg Kh√°n became extinct. He was buried at Sihor in Kathiwar. ;Rivalry between Ratansingh Bhand√°ri and Mom√≠n Kh√°n, 1735 After this success a single horseman attacked and wounded Ratansingh Bhand√°ri in two places. The horseman was at once slain, but no one was able to recognize him. Ratansingh, who in two months had recovered from his injuries, now determined to attack Mom√≠n Kh√°n, as that officer in the recent struggle had taken part with Sohr√°b Kh√°n. Mom√≠n Kh√°n hearing of Ratansingh's intentions, withdrew to Cambay. In the course of this year, on the expiry of the period of the farm of Mahudha, Arhar-M√°tar, and Na·∏çi√°d, these districts were transferred from Mom√≠n Kh√°n to Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi. Kali√°nchand, was appointed to V√≠ramg√°m in place of Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, and instead of Sohr√°b Kh√°n, Muhsin Kh√°n Kh√°lvi was made deputy governor of Sorath. ;Battle of √Ånand-Mogri, 1735. About this time D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, who had been chosen by Um√°b√°i as her representative in Gujar√°t, appointed Rangoji to act as his agent. K√°nt√°ji being dissatisfied with this arrangement, in which his rights were ignored, marched into Gujar√°t. Rangoji met him, and a battle was fought at √Ånand-Mogri, twenty-five miles south-east of Kheda, in which K√°nt√°ji was defeated and his son killed. In consequence of this reverse K√°nt√°ji retired to Petl√°d. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, who with his army was drawn up near Petl√°d to oppose Rangoji, was compelled to retire to Cambay, where peace was concluded on condition that D√°m√°ji should receive the one- fourth share of the revenues of the country north of the Mahi. As the districts where these battles were fought were held in farm by Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, he suffered much loss, and consequently retired to R√°dhanpur. Rangoji was joined by D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, and these two leaders went together to Dholka. While they were there, Bh√°vsingh of V√≠ramg√°m invited them to that town, both on account of the annoyance he suffered from the M√°rv√°dis and that he might take vengeance on the Kasb√°tis for the murder of his father Udaikaran. He accordingly admitted the Mar√°th√°s and slew Daulat Muhammad T√°nk, brother of the murderer of his father, and expelled the rest of the Kasb√°tis, while Kali√°n, the M√°rv√°di administrator, was permitted to go to √Åhmed√°b√°d. Leaving Rangoji at V√≠ramg√°m, D√°m√°ji marched into Sorath to levy tribute from the chiefs, and after collecting a portion of his dues, returned to the Dakhan. In the following year (1736) Rangoji advanced as far as Bavla near Dholka wasting the country. Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, the deputy viceroy, marched against him, and forced him to retire to V√≠ramg√°m. Ratansingh pursued the Mar√°th√°s to V√≠ramg√°m, attacked and defeated them capturing their baggage, but failed to prevent them taking shelter in the town. About this time some Mar√°tha horse who were at Sarn√°l, otherwise called Th√°sra, joined the Kolis of those parts, advanced with them against Kapadvanj and without any serious resistance succeeded in capturing the town. Meanwhile, though Ratansingh had summoned Mom√≠n Kh√°n to his aid, he delayed coming, as he began to scheme independence at Cambay. Ratansingh Bhand√°ri heard that Prat√°pr√°v, brother of D√°m√°ji, and Dev√°ji T√°kpar were advancing on √Åhmed√°b√°d with 10,000 horse. At first he thought this a device to draw him from V√≠ramg√°m, to whose walls his mines had reached. On ascertaining from trusty spies that the report was true, he raised the siege of V√≠ramg√°m, returned rapidly to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and pushing forward to meet Prat√°pr√°v, exacted tribute from the chiefs on the banks of the V√°trak. As Prat√°pr√°v drew near, the governor of the Bh√≠l district retired before him, and he continuing his advance, passed through Valad and Pethapur, and so by way of Chh√°la reached Dholka. Here, through Muhammad Ism√°√≠l, the governor of Dholka, he demanded from the Bhand√°ri his share of the revenue. Afterwards, leaving 2000 horse in Dholka, he went to Dhandh√∫ka. In the meantime K√°nt√°ji, who was a follower of B√°jir√°v Peshwa, joining with Malh√°rr√°v Holkar, advanced upon √çdar, and coming against D√°nta, plundered that town. Some N√°gar Br√°hmans of the town of Vadnagar, who were settled in D√°nta, tried to escape to the hills, but were intercepted and pillaged. The Mar√°th√°s then proceeded to Vadnagar and plundered the town. From Vadnagar they went as far as P√°lanpur, where Pah√°r Kh√°n Jh√°lori, being unable to oppose them, agreed to pay a tribute of Rupees 1 l√°kh. K√°nt√°ji and Malh√°rr√°v Holkar then marched into M√°rw√°r, while Prat√°pr√°v and Rangoji crossed over from Dhandhuka into K√°thi√°v√°·∏ça and Gohilv√°·∏ça. About this time Muhammad Pah√°r Kh√°n Jh√°lori was appointed deputy governor of P√°tan on behalf of Vakhatsingh. As no settlement of his demands on the revenues of Dholka had yet been made, Prat√°pr√°v returned to that town and sent Narhar Pandit to receive the tribute due to him. Afterwards proceeding to Baroda with Rangoji they were summoned to Sorath by D√°m√°ji to assist him. Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, who up to his time had been at Kaira, now came to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and as the deputy viceroy was displeased with Mom√≠n Kh√°n's conduct when V√≠ramg√°m was besieged, he appointed Sher Kh√°n his own deputy at Petl√°d, Arhar-M√°tar, and Na·∏çi√°d. Afterwards on Mom√≠n Kh√°n's remonstrance Subh√°chand M√°rv√°di was appointed to examine the accounts and receive the revenue in place of Sher Kh√°n. In 1737 D√°m√°ji's brother Prat√°pr√°v, returning to his country after exacting tribute from the chiefs of Sorath, died of smallpox at K√°nkar near Dholka. Mom√≠n Kh√°n seeing that Sher Kh√°n had not yet left Kaira, collected some men and came to Petl√°d, while Sher Kh√°n went to Dehgam and awaited the departure of Rangoji. Ratansingh Bhand√°ri made preparations to help Sher Kh√°n and Mom√≠n Kh√°n returned to Cambay. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, Fifty-fourth Viceroy, 1737 At this time as the Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh was not in favour at court, Mom√≠n Kh√°n was appointed fifty-fourth viceroy. As he was unable to effect anything by himself he persuaded Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi to join him by a promise of the government of P√°tan and directed him to proceed and take up that appointment. Now the Jh√°loris were allies of the R√°tho·∏çs, and Pah√°r Kh√°n Jh√°lori, then in command of P√°tan, opposed Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, but was finally obliged to vacate P√°tan. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, who had not hitherto produced the order appointing him viceroy, now made it public and began to act as viceroy with the title of Najm-ud- daul√°h Mom√≠n Kh√°n Bah√°dur F√≠r√∫z Jang, and in 1737 sent a copy of this order to Abd√∫l Husain Kh√°n, the deputy minister, and to Mustaf√≠d Kh√°n, who held the office of K√°zi. Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, wishing to remain neutral, retired to B√°l√°sinor and Mom√≠n Kh√°n summoned Rangoji, who was in the neighbourhood of Cambay, to his assistance. Rangoji agreed to aid him in expelling the M√°rv√°dis, on condition that, if successful, he should be granted one-half of the produce of Gujar√°t except the city of √Åhmed√°b√°d, the lands in the neighbourhood of the city, and the port of Cambay. This alliance with the Mar√°th√°s gave the last blow to Mughal power in Gujar√°t, which otherwise might have lingered for at least a quarter of a century. When Ratansingh Bhand√°ri heard of the appointment of Mom√≠n Kh√°n to be viceroy, he wrote to Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh for orders. Meanwhile, he sent officials to Cambay to persuade Mom√≠n Kh√°n to take no further steps until a reply should be received to the reference Mom√≠n Kh√°n had made to √Ågra. The reply of the Mah√°r√°ja was that Ratansingh should resist Mom√≠n Kh√°n if he could. Ratansingh prepared to defend √Åhmed√°b√°d while Mom√≠n Kh√°n collecting an army, camped at the N√°ransar lake. ;Siege of Ahmedabad From the N√°ransar lake where Mom√≠n Kh√°n remained encamped for one and a half months collecting his partisans he advanced to Sojitra, where he was joined by Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi; and proceeding together they came to Vasu under Petl√°d, about twenty-six miles from √Åhmed√°b√°d, and from Vasu to Kaira, about eighteen miles from the capital. At Kaira they encamped on the banks of the V√°trak, where, owing to the incessant rain, they were forced to remain for about a month. When the rain abated and the rivers were fordable, Mom√≠n Kh√°n, moving to √Åhmed√°b√°d, encamped in front of the city on the K√°nkariya tank and prepared for a siege. About the same time Mom√≠n Kh√°n's manager, Vajer√°m, whom he had sent to Songad to solicit D√°m√°ji to march in person to his assistance, arrived and informed him that D√°m√°ji would join him shortly. Zor√°war Kh√°n, who had been left at the Mar√°tha camp as security for the payment of the tribute, was recalled, and instead the district of Prantij was formally assigned to the Mar√°th√°s in payment of their demands. Some of the Mah√°r√°ja's guns, which were being sent to √Åhmed√°b√°d by his agents at Surat through Cambay for facility of transit, were about this time captured by a party of Mom√≠n Kh√°n's men. When Ratansingh Bhand√°ri wrote to the Mah√°r√°ja of Mom√≠n Kh√°n's advance on √Åhmed√°b√°d, the Mah√°r√°ja was much displeased, and went from the emperor's presence in anger. The nobles fearing the consequences, recalled him, and persuaded the emperor to re-appoint him viceroy of Gujar√°t. Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh, Fifty-fifth Viceroy, 1737 ;Mom√≠n Kh√°n continues the Siege of √Åhmed√°b√°d Mom√≠n Kh√°n was secretly enjoined to disregard the Mah√°r√°ja's appointment and persevere in expelling the R√°tho·∏çs of Marwar, and was assured of the emperor's approbation of this line of conduct. He therefore continued to prosecute the siege with vigour. In the meantime another order was received from the imperial court, confirming the reappointment of the Mah√°r√°ja and appointing Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n to guard the city with 500 men, directing also that Mom√≠n Kh√°n should return to Cambay. It was further stated that, as Ratansingh Bhand√°ri had acted oppressively, some other person should be appointed deputy to fill his place, and that in the meantime a R√°jput noble, named Abhaikaran, was to carry on the government. Shortly before this Muhammad B√°kir Kh√°n, son of Mu√¢tamid Kh√°n, joined Mom√≠n Kh√°n from Surat, while S√°dik √Åli Kh√°n and his nephew reinforced him from Jun√°ga·∏çh. When Mom√≠n Kh√°n was informed of the purport of the imperial order he agreed to return to Cambay, provided Ratansingh Bhand√°ri would quit the city, hand over charge to Abhaikaran, and admit Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n and his men into the city. Ratansingh Bhand√°ri determined not to leave the city, and prepared to defend himself to the last. D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r now joined Mom√≠n Kh√°n from Songad. Mom√≠n Kh√°n met D√°m√°ji at Isanpur, three miles from √Åhmed√°b√°d, and made great show of friendship, calling him his brother. When Ratansingh Bhand√°ri heard of the arrangements made between D√°m√°ji and Mom√≠n Kh√°n, he sent a message to D√°m√°ji saying, 'Mom√≠n Kh√°n has promised Rangoji half of the revenues of Gujar√°t excepting the city of √Åhmed√°b√°d, the lands immediately round it, and Cambay. If you will join me, I will give you half of everything not excepting the city nor Cambay, and will send to your camp some of my chief landholders as security if you agree.' D√°m√°ji showed this to Mom√≠n Kh√°n, and asked him what he proposed to do. Mom√≠n Kh√°n now perforce agreed to do the same; but instead of Cambay offered to make over to the Mar√°th√°s the whole district of V√≠ramg√°m. D√°m√°ji, accepting these terms, ceased to negotiate with Ratansingh. He then went on pilgrimage to Dudesar, and returning in the same year, 1738, he and Rangoji began active operations against √Åhmed√°b√°d. Their bombardment did so much damage to the city that Mom√≠n Kh√°n repented having called them to his aid, and foresaw that if the Mar√°th√°s once gained any portion of the city it would be no easy matter to drive them out. Mom√≠n Kh√°n now sent the writer of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi to Ratansingh Bhand√°ri, in hopes that he might withdraw peaceably, but Ratansingh refused to listen to any terms. After some time the people under K√°zim √Åli Kh√°n and others, and the Mar√°th√°s under B√°bur√°v endeavoured to take the city by storm, but after a bloody contest were forced to retire. Next day Ratansingh, seeing that he could not long hold the city, entered into a negotiation with Mom√≠n Kh√°n, and, on receiving a sum of money for his expenses, and on being allowed to retire with the honours of war, left the city. ;Mom√≠n Kh√°n entered √Åhmed√°b√°d On the capture of the city, in accordance with Mom√≠n Kh√°n's engagement, half of it was handed to the Mar√°th√°s. Mom√≠n Kh√°n sent news of what had taken place to the emperor, and appointed Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n his deputy. D√°m√°ji, who in the meantime had been to Sorath, now returned and was met by Rangoji, who accompanied him as far as the banks of the Mahi, whence Rangoji proceeded to Dholka. After spending a few days at Dholka, Rangoji returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d and took charge of his share of the city, which comprised the Raikhad, Kh√°njch√°n, and Jamalpur quarters as far as the Astoria and R√°ipur gates. The city was thus equally divided, and the Astodia and Raipur gates were guarded by the Mar√°th√°s. At that time the inhabitants of √Åhmed√°b√°d rose against the strangers, and after a severe affray expelled the greater part of them from the city. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, though secretly pleased, affected ignorance and sent Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n to reassure Rangoji. This with some difficulty he succeeded in doing and Rangoji remained in the city. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was sent to P√°tan, and, instead of Pr√°ntij, the district of Kheralu was granted to Zor√°war Kh√°n B√°bi. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, Fifth-sixth Viceroy, 1738‚Äì1743 With the cessation of Mar√°tha oppression, √Åhmed√°b√°d began to recover its splendour and opulence. The emperor was much pleased with Mom√≠n Kh√°n, and, raising his rank, presented him with a dress of honour, a sword, and other articles of value. At the close of the rainy season Mom√≠n Kh√°n went to levy tribute from the chiefs on the banks of the Sabarmati, and Rangoji was asked to accompany him. They marched to Adalaj whence Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, the deputy viceroy, returned to the city accompanied by R√°m√°ji as deputy of Rangoji. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n and Sher Kh√°n B√°bi now joined the viceroy's camp, and, about the same time Hathising, chief of Peth√°pur, paid a visit to the viceroy and settled his tribute. From Ad√°laj they advanced to Mansa and were met by the M√°nsa chief. From M√°nsa they proceeded to Kadi, and from Kadi to V√≠j√°pur. After Mom√≠n Kh√°n left the people of √Åhmed√°b√°d were badly treated, and Rangoji, leaving his brother Akoji in camp, returned to the capital, whence he marched towards V√≠ramg√°m and Sorath. Mom√≠n Kh√°n went from V√≠j√°pur to √çdar, and there levied tribute from the chiefs of Mohanpur and Ran√°san. ;The Viceroy collects Tribute, 1738 When Mom√≠n Kh√°n arrived at √çdar, √Ånandsingh and R√°isingh, brothers of Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh, went to him and paid the tribute of Mohanpur and Ran√°san as being within the limits of the √çdar territory. The matter was amicably settled, and the two brothers accompanied the viceroy as far as the √çdar frontier, when √Ånandsingh returned to √çdar, and R√°isingh, at Mom√≠n Kh√°n's request, remained with him, Mom√≠n Kh√°n undertaking to pay the expenses of his men. Prathir√°j, the chief of M√°nsa, agreed to pay Rupees 23,000 and the chief of Varsoda Rupees 10,000 as tribute. At this time Sher Muhammad Kh√°n B√°bi was appointed to succeed M√≠r Dost √Åli as deputy governor of Sorath. The Mar√°th√°s, who had attempted to deprive some of the Ras√∫l√°b√°d and Batwa Sayads of their land, were attacked by the Muslim population, and a few men were wounded on either side. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, receiving tribute from various chiefs, had now reached Palanpur, and Pah√°r Kh√°n Jh√°lori, the governor of that place, was introduced to the viceroy by Sher Kh√°n B√°bi. As news was now received that Dev√°ji T√°kpar was advancing through the Baroda districts, Mom√≠n Kh√°n marched towards √Åhmed√°b√°d, dismissing Pah√°r Kh√°n Jh√°lori on the P√°lanpur frontier. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi, appointing his brother Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi as his deputy at P√°tan, pushed forward in advance for √Åhmed√°b√°d. M√°m√∫r Kh√°n, who had been chosen by M√≠r Huzabr √Åli as his deputy in Sorath, now arrived and complained to Mom√≠n Kh√°n regarding Sher Kh√°n B√°bi's appointment. Mom√≠n Kh√°n said that, as neither had assumed charge of their duties, they should await final orders from the emperor. He then advanced to H√°jipur, and thence encamped on the side of the city near Bahr√°mpur and occupied himself in strengthening the city defences. From that camp he proceeded to √çsanpur four miles south of √Åhmed√°b√°d on his way to levy tribute from the Koli chiefs of the banks of the V√°trak. After this he proceeded to Kulej on the V√°trak and levied tribute from the Koli chiefs of that neighbourhood. Hearing that D√°m√°ji had left Songad, and crossing the Mahi had gone to Ar√°s, Mom√≠n Kh√°n struck his camp and returned to the city, while D√°m√°ji going to Dholka marched from that to Sorath. Mom√≠n Kh√°n now permitted Sher Kh√°n to return to his lands in Ghogha, whence he proceeded to Jun√°ga·∏çh and took charge of the office of deputy governor. ;Sher Kh√°n B√°bi Deputy Governor of Sorath, 1738 In 1738, M√≠r Huzabr Kh√°n, the governor of Sorath, died, and as Sher Kh√°n had occupied Jun√°ga·∏çh, and taken into his employ all the troops of Mir Dost √Åli, M√°m√∫r Kh√°n was obliged to resign his pretensions and return. The emperor now appointed Himmat √Åli Kh√°n, nephew of Mom√≠n Kh√°n, governor of Sorath, and he wrote to his uncle to choose a fitting deputy. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, as the Mar√°tha incursions into Sorath increased yearly, and as Sher Kh√°n B√°bi was a man able to hold his own with them, suffered him to remain as deputy. When D√°m√°ji returned to V√≠ramg√°m, after levying tribute from the chiefs of Sorath, he was obliged to march against K√°nji Koli, the chief of Chhani√°r in the Ch√∫nv√°l. As he could not prevail against them he was forced to call on Mom√≠n Kh√°n for aid. Mom√≠n Kh√°n sent Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n at the head of a well-equipped army. On their approach the Kolis fled, and the village was burned, and Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n returned to the capital. D√°m√°ji, leaving Rangoji as his deputy, returned to Songad. In 1738, Mughal Empire was invaded by the Persian Emperor N√°dir Sh√°h, Delhi sacked, and the emperor Muhammad Shah made prisoner. Except that coin was struck in N√°dir's name, the collapse of Mughal power caused little change in Gujar√°t. ;The Deputy Viceroy collects Tribute, 1739 In 1739 Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n was sent to levy tribute from the chiefs on the banks of the S√°barmati, and, accompanied by Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi and R√°ja R√°isingh of √çdar, marched to Char√°rah. As the village of P√°nmul under Vij√°pur had been assigned to the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi, he accompanied Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, who marched to Ahmednagar, and demanded tribute from J√≠tsingh of Mohanpur and Ran√°san. J√≠tsingh resisted and a doubtful battle was fought. Next day Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n changed his position and again attacked J√≠tsingh, who being defeated agreed to pay Rupees 10,000. They then went to √çdar, where they were hospitably received by R√°ja R√°ising, who presented the leaders with horses. From √çdar they proceeded to Vadnagar, which was under Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, who also received them courteously and presented horses. The army then marched to Visalnagar. On the arrival of the troops at Visalnagar, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n requested Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n to subdue J√°m√°ji the Koli chief of Thara-J√°mpur in the K√°nkrej, who was then at Balisana under P√°tan and who was continually plundering the country. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n marched to B√°l√≠s√°na, but J√°m√°ji fled to Thara-J√°mpur without risking a battle and the Mughal troops plundered Thara-J√°mpur. From B√°l√≠s√°na Fid√°-ud-d√≠n marched to Kadi, and allowing Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n to return to P√°tan proceeded to √Åhmed√°b√°d. At √Åhmed√°b√°d disputes between Rangoji and Mom√≠n Kh√°n regarding the government of the city were frequent. In one serious disturbance Mom√≠n Kh√°n was worsted and forced to sue for peace and grant Rangoji his half share both in the government and revenue, which, since the affray in 1738, Mom√≠n Kh√°n had withheld. A formal agreement was drawn up but did not long remain in force. About this time Mom√≠n Kh√°n's nephew Muhammad Mom√≠n Kh√°n Bakhshi received a patent granting him the title of Nazar √Åli Kh√°n. In 1739, there was a disastrous flood in the S√°barmati. ;Capture of Bassein by the Mar√°th√°s, 1739 In 1739, the Mar√°th√°s under Chimn√°ji √Åpa successfully captured the fort of Vasai (Bassein) from the Portuguese following the Battle of Vasai. In 1740, on his return from Sorath, D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r took Rangoji to the Dakhan and appointed Malh√°rr√°v Kh√∫ni his deputy at √Åhmed√°b√°d. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n met the new deputy at √çsanpur and escorted him to the city. Shortly after Fid√°-ud- d√≠n Kh√°n and Nazar √Åli Kh√°n started to collect tribute, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n sent his brother Zor√°war Kh√°n B√°bi to accompany them. They advanced against Dabhoda under Bahyal eighteen miles east of √Åhmed√°b√°d in the Bh√≠l district and fought with the chief, who agreed to pay tribute. Then they went to Atarsumba, where the Kolis after a vain attempt to carry off their cannon agreed to pay tribute. The force then proceeded to M√°ndva and levied a contribution from the Mandva chief. They next went to Kapadvanj, and passing through B√°l√°sinor reached Virpur under Lun√°v√°·∏ça. Here, from Sult√°nsingh, agent of the Lunavada chief, they received two horses and Rupees 3000 as tribute. While at Lun√°v√°·∏ça an order of recall came from Mom√≠n Kh√°n, who intimated that Malh√°rr√°v Kh√∫ni had laid up large stores of grain and contemplated war. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n at once pushed forward through B√°l√°sinor and Kapadvanj, advancing rapidly towards the capital. On the way he received a second despatch from Mom√≠n Kh√°n saying that, as the risk of war had for the present passed, they should advance to Petl√°d, where they would find Malh√°rr√°v Kh√∫ni and settle with him about the revenue accounts. They continued their march, and in two days reached Kaira (Kheda), being joined on the way by Muhammad K√∫li Kh√°n, who was charged with messages from Mom√≠n Kh√°n. At Kaira they found Muhammad Husain, nephew of Fid√°- ud-d√≠n Kh√°n who had been sent with a force to Mahudha. As Malh√°rr√°v Kh√∫ni was at Pinj near Kaira, Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n expressed a wish to meet him, and it was agreed that both sides should go to the Petl√°d district and there settle the disputed collections. Shortly after they met and arrangements were in progress when the Kolis of the Bh√≠l district rebelled and Abd√∫l Husain Kh√°n and Vajer√°m were sent against them. After burning two or three villages this detachment rejoined the main body, and not long after all returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. During 1740, B√°jir√°v Peshwa died. In 1741, Mom√≠n Kh√°n went to Cambay, and while residing at Ghi√°spur near that city received information that D√°m√°ji had again appointed Rangoji his deputy in place of Malh√°rr√°v Kh√∫ni, and shortly after Rangoji arrived at Petl√°d. At this time Mom√≠n Kh√°n turned his attention to the falling off in the customs revenue of Cambay and appointed Ism√°il Muhammad collector of customs. As he was anxious to clear some misunderstanding between Rangoji and himself, Mom√≠n Kh√°n set out to visit Rangoji and assure him of his good wishes. At this time Bhavsingh of Viramgam, who found the Mar√°th√°s even more troublesome than the Mughals, as soon as he heard of Malh√°rr√°v's recall, suddenly attacked the fort of V√≠ramg√°m and with the aid of some Arabs and Rohillas expelled the Mar√°tha garrison and prepared to hold the fort on his own account. Shortly after Rangoji demanded that a tower in √Åhmed√°b√°d, which had been raised a story by Mom√≠n Kh√°n so as to command the residence of the Mar√°tha deputy at the Jam√°lpur gate, should be reduced to its original height. At the same time he suggested that Mom√≠n Kh√°n and he, uniting their forces, should advance and expel Bh√°vsingh from V√≠ramg√°m. Mom√≠n Kh√°n agreed to both proposals. The addition to the tower was pulled down, and Mom√≠n Kh√°n and Rangoji, marching against V√≠ramg√°m, laid siege to the town. Bh√°vsingh made a gallant defence, and Mom√≠n Kh√°n, who was not sorry to see the Mar√°th√°s in difficulties, after a time left them and marched to Kadi and Vij√°pur to levy tribute. Rangoji continued the siege, and as Bh√°vsingh saw that even without Mom√≠n Kh√°n the Mar√°tha army was sufficient to reduce the place, he agreed to surrender V√≠ramg√°m, provided the fort of Patdi and its dependent villages were granted to him. Rangoji agreed, and thus the Mar√°th√°s again obtained possession of V√≠ramg√°m, while Bh√°vsingh acquired P√°tdi, a property which his descendants hold until independence of India. When Mom√≠n Kh√°n arrived at Mansa, about twenty-six miles north-west of √Åhmed√°b√°d, hearing that D√°m√°ji had crossed the Mahi with 10,000 men, he at once returned to the capital. D√°m√°ji arrived at M√°nsa and besieged it. The chiefs and Kolis defended the place bravely for about a month, when it fell into D√°m√°ji's hands, who not only cleared the prickly-pear stockade which surrounded it, but also burned the town. From M√°nsa, D√°m√°ji marched to Sorath. On his return he laid siege to Bharuch, a fort which, from its natural strength as well as from its favourable position on the Narmada, it had been the constant ambition both of D√°m√°ji and of his father P√≠l√°ji to capture. On the approach of D√°m√°ji, Nek √Ålam Kh√°n, who held the place in the interests of the Niz√°m, prepared to defend the fort, and wrote to the Niz√°m for aid. In reply the Niz√°m warned D√°m√°ji not to attack his possessions. On receiving this letter D√°m√°ji raised the siege and returned to Songad. It seems probable that concessions were made to tempt D√°m√°ji to retire from Bharuch, and that the G√°ikw√°r's share in the Bharuch customs dated from this siege. ;Battle of Dholka (1741) In 1741, in a battle between K√°im K√∫li Kh√°n, governor of Dholka, and Rangoji's deputy, the Mar√°th√°s were defeated. Mom√≠n Kh√°n, at the request of Rangoji, made peace between them. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, who had recently been raised in rank with the title of Bah√°dur, starting to collect tribute burned down the refractory Koli village of Dabhoda, and placing a post there, passed to Satumba, Balasinor, and Th√°sra. After the battle at Dholka, the building by Rangoji of the fort of Borsad, caused renewed fighting between the Mughals and Mar√°th√°s of Dholka. At the request of Muhammad H√°di Kh√°n, governor of Dholka, Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, passing through Mahudha to Petl√°d pushed forward to help him. In the meantime a battle was fought, in which the Mar√°th√°s under Malh√°rr√°v attacked Muhammad H√°di Kh√°n, and after a short contest withdrew. Next day the Mughals, strengthened by the arrival of Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, besieged Sojitra. A letter was written to Rangoji, asking the meaning of the attack, and he replied excusing himself and attributing it to the ignorance of Malh√°rr√°v. Muhammad H√°di Kh√°n and the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi eventually met Rangoji at Borsad, and settled that he and Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n should come together and arrange matters. But Rangoji in his heart intended to fight and wrote to his deputy R√°m√°ji at √Åhmed√°b√°d to be ready for war. Malh√°rr√°v now joined Rangoji at Borsad. At this time many misunderstandings and several fights between the Mar√°th√°s and the Muhammadans were appeased by Mom√≠n Kh√°n and Rangoji, who, in spite of the ill-feeling among their subordinates and a certain distrust of each other's designs, appear throughout to have maintained a warm mutual regard. D√°m√°ji from his stronghold at Songad was too much occupied in Dakhan politics to give much attention to Gujar√°t. Rangoji, on the other hand, gained so much influence with the Gujar√°t chiefs, that at one time he succeeded in engaging Sajansingh Haz√°ri in his service, and also induced R√°ja R√°isingh of √çdar to join him. But Mom√≠n Kh√°n detached R√°isingh from this alliance, by placing him in charge of the post of Amaliara and granting him the districts of Modasa, Meghrej, Ahmednagar (Himatnagar), Prantij, and Harsol. Moreover, the customary Gujar√°t sum at first sent daily by Rangoji to R√°ja R√°isingh for the expenses of his troops had begun to fall into arrears. R√°ja R√°isingh made his peace with Mom√≠n Kh√°n through the mediation of Nazar √Åli Kh√°n, Mom√≠n Kh√°n's nephew, who appears to have been one of the leading spirits of the time. In 1742, in another fight between the Mar√°th√°s and Mughals in √Åhmed√°b√°d, the Mughals gained a slight advantage. After this Rangoji left the city, appointing as before R√°m√°ji as his deputy, and joining Jagj√≠wan Pav√°r went to Borsad, where he had built a fort. At this time one J√≠vand√°s came with authority from the Niz√°m to act as collector of Dholka, part of the lands assigned to the Niz√°m as a personal grant, but failed to enforce his position. Shortly after this R√°ja √Ånandsing of √çdar was killed, and his brother R√°ising, taking leave, went to √çdar to settle matters. Mom√≠n Kh√°n had his patent increased to the personal rank of commander of 6000 with a contingent of 6000 cavalry. He received a dress of honour, a jewelled turban, a plume, six pieces of cloth, an elephant, the order of M√°hi-mar√°tib, and the title of Najm-ud- daulah Mom√≠n Kh√°n Bah√°dur Dil√°war Jang. Differences again broke out between Mom√≠n Kh√°n and Rangoji, and again matters were settled by a friendly meeting between the two chiefs at Borsad, where Rangoji had taken up his residence. Mom√≠n Kh√°n now went to Petl√°d, and from that to Cambay, where he was taken ill, but after six weeks came to Vasu, where Rangoji visited him. Here though again unwell he went to Dholka, and shortly afterwards he and Rangoji marched upon Limbdi, which at this time is mentioned as under V√≠ramg√°m. While before Limb·∏çi, Rangoji was summoned by D√°m√°ji to help him against B√°pu N√°ik, and at once started to his assistance. Mom√≠n Kh√°n now marched into Gohilwad, and proceeded by Loliana to Ghogha, then under the charge of a resident deputy of Sher Kh√°n B√°bi. Here he received tribute from the chief of Sihor, and from that, marching into Halar, went against Nawanagar. The J√°m resisted for twenty days, and eventually, on his agreeing to pay Rupees 50,000 as tribute, Mom√≠n Kh√°n returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. During his absence in spite of stubborn resistance, Nazar √Åli Kh√°n and Vajer√°m had collected tribute from the Koli chiefs. Rangoji, who had now left D√°m√°ji, joined battle with B√°pu N√°ik ere he crossed the Mahi, and B√°pu N√°ik turned back. Rangoji therefore remained at Borsad, but hearing that Mom√≠n Kh√°n's illness had become serious, he went once or twice to √Åhmed√°b√°d to visit him. In 1743, Mom√≠n Kh√°n died. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n acts as Viceroy, 1743 Momin Khan's wife, fearing lest Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n and Muftakhir Kh√°n, Mom√≠n Kh√°n's son, would deprive her of her estate, sought the protection of Rangoji. In the meantime Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n and Muftakhir Kh√°n received an imperial order to carry on the government until a new viceroy should be appointed. At this time a man named √Ånandr√°m, who had been disgraced by Mom√≠n Kh√°n, went over to Rangoji and incited him to murder Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n and Muftakhir Kh√°n. Rangoji with this intention invited them both to his house, but his heart failed him, and shortly afterwards Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n went to Cambay. Rangoji now determined at all hazards to assassinate Muftakhir Kh√°n. With this object he took Muftakhir Kh√°n's associates, Vajer√°m and K√°im K√∫li Kh√°n, into his confidence. Muftakhir Kh√°n accidentally heard of his designs, and remained on his guard. As Rangoji had failed to carry out his promise to raise Sher Kh√°n B√°bi to the post of deputy viceroy, Sher Kh√°n advanced to Dholka and began plundering some Cambay villages. Rangoji, after another futile attempt to assassinate Muftakhir Kh√°n, sent for his deputy R√°m√°ji, who was then in the neighbourhood, and prepared to fight. Muftakhir Kh√°n, on his part, summoned Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n from Cambay, and in a few days they succeeded in uniting their forces. Sher Kh√°n B√°bi deserting the cause of Rangoji, the Mar√°th√°s were worsted and Rangoji's house was besieged. Rangoji, being hard pressed, agreed to give up √Ånandr√°m and to surrender both Borsad and V√≠ramg√°m, Sher Kh√°n B√°bi becoming his security. In this way Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n became sole master of Gujar√°t. Shortly after D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r returned from Satara and came to Cambay. In the meantime Rangoji, who had been living with Sher Kh√°n B√°bi, his security, contrived, with the connivance of Sher Kh√°n, to escape together with his family. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n was so greatly enraged with Sher Kh√°n for this treachery, that Sher Kh√°n leaving √Åhmed√°b√°d on pretence of hunting, escaped to B√°l√°sinor, where his wife joined him. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n put √Ånandr√°m to death, while Rangoji through the aid of Sher Kh√°n B√°bi's wife, made good his escape to Borsad. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n had set out to collect tribute, when news arrived that Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r, brother of D√°m√°ji, had crossed the Mahi and joining Rangoji had laid siege to Petl√°d. On hearing this, Fid√°-ud-d√≠n at once returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and sent Valabhd√°s Kotw√°l to Khander√°v to complain of the misconduct of Rangoji. =Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z Kh√°n of Junnar, Viceroy (by a forged order)= After the death of Mom√≠n Kh√°n, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi was the greatest noble in Gujar√°t. He began to aspire to power, and Fid√°-ud-d√≠n, who was not good in the field, had thoughts of appointing him as a deputy. While matters were in this state, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was already laying claim to the revenue of the district round √Åhmed√°b√°d, an order was received appointing Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z Kh√°n the commander of Junnar, near Poona, to be viceroy of Gujar√°t. This order was forged by Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z Kh√°n in Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n's interests, whom he appointed his deputy. Though Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n doubted the genuineness of the order, he was not powerful enough to remove Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, who accordingly proclaimed himself deputy viceroy. ;Mutiny of the Troops At this time the troops, clamorous on account of arrears, placed both Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n and Muftakhir Kh√°n under confinement. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n assumed charge of the city and stationed his own men on guard. While Fid√°-ud- d√≠n Kh√°n and Muftakhir Kh√°n were in confinement, Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r sent them a message that if they would cause the fort of Petl√°d to be surrendered to him, he would help them. To this they returned no answer. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n now entreated Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n to interfere between him and his troops. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n accordingly persuaded the mutineers to release Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, who eventually escaped from the city and went to Agra. ;Mar√°th√°s Capture Petl√°d Meanwhile, Rangoji continued to press the siege of Petl√°d and the commander, √Ågha Muhammad Husain, after in vain appealing for help to Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, was forced to surrender. Rangoji demolished the fort of Petl√°d and marched upon √Åhmed√°b√°d. As he approached the city Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n sent the writer of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi and Ajabsingh to negotiate with Rangoji, who demanded all his former rights and possessions. Muftakhir Kh√°n, Fifty-seventh Viceroy, 1743‚Äì44 News had now reached Delhi that a false viceroy was governing Gujar√°t, and accordingly Muftakhir Kh√°n was chosen fifty-seventh viceroy, the order explaining that Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z had never been appointed viceroy, and directing Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n to withdraw from the conduct of affairs. Muftakhir Kh√°n was perplexed how to act. He succeeded in persuading his troops that he would be able to pay them their arrears, and he sent a copy of the order to Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n; and, as he dared not displace him, he informed Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n that he had appointed him as his deputy, and that he himself would shortly leave √Åhmed√°b√°d. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, so far from obeying, ordered Muftakhir Kh√°n's house to be surrounded. Eventually Muftakhir Kh√°n, leaving the city, joined Rangoji, and then retired to Cambay. ;The Mar√°th√°s in √Åhmed√°b√°d Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r returned, and, with the view of enforcing his claims, uniting with Rangoji, marched to Banjar, about five miles south of √Åhmed√°b√°d. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n issuing from the city camped near the Kankaria Lake. Narhar Pandit and Krishn√°ji on behalf of the Mar√°tha leaders were sent to Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n to demand their former rights and possessions. Jaw√°n at first refused, but in the end gave way and the Mar√°th√°s appointed D√°du Mor√°r deputy of the city. Sher Kh√°n B√°bi now returned to B√°l√°sinor. Khander√°v and K√°n√°ji then went to Dholka, Rangoji to Petl√°d, and Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r to Sorath. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n requested Rangoji to help Muftakhir Kh√°n; he replied that he was willing to help him, but had no money. Rangoji then accompanied Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n to Cambay, where Muftakhir Kh√°n was. Negotiations were entered into, and the Kh√°ns tried to collect Rupees 1 l√°kh which Rangoji asked for to enable him to make military preparations to aid them. They raised Rupees 80,000 with great difficulty and admitted Rangoji's N√°ib to a share in the administration. Rangoji withdrew to Borsad with the Rupees 80,000 under the pretext that when the remaining Rupees 20,000 were paid he would take action. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, annoyed at Rangoji's conduct, went to reside at Dhowan, a village belonging to J√°lam J√°lia Koli. ;Battle of K√≠m Kathodra and defeat and death of Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z Kh√°n, 1744 In 1744 Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, after appointing one of his brothers, Zor√°war Kh√°n, his deputy at P√°tan, and keeping his other brother Safdar Kh√°n at √Åhmed√°b√°d, advanced from the city to Kadi to collect tribute. His next step was to invite Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z Kh√°n, the commander of Junnar, near Poona, to join him in Gujar√°t. Abdul √Åz√≠z accordingly set out from Junnar, taking with him Fatehy√°b Kh√°n, commander of the fort of Mulher in Baglan and Rustamr√°v Mar√°tha. Directing his march in the first instance to Surat he was there watched in the interests of D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, by Dev√°ji T√°kpar, the lieutenant of that chief, who, seeing that on leaving Surat, Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z continued to advance to √Åhmed√°b√°d, pursued him to K√≠m Kathodra, about fifteen miles north-west of Surat, and there attacked him. In the engagement Dev√°ji T√°kpar, who had gained over Rustamr√°v Mar√°tha, one of the leading men in Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z's army, was victorious. Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z Kh√°n retired, but was so closely followed by the Mar√°th√°s, that at Panoli he was forced to leave his elephant, and, mounting a horse, fled with all speed towards Bharuch. On reaching the Narmada, he failed to find any boats, and, as his pursuers were close upon him, putting his horse at the water, he tried to swim the river; but, sticking fast in the mud, he was overtaken and slain by the Mar√°th√°s. Fakhr-ud-daulah, Fifty-eighth Viceroy, 1744‚Äì1748 On hearing of the death of Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n thought of joining Muftakhir Kh√°n. Here he could carry this plan into effect, the emperor receiving, it is said, a present of Rupees 2 l√°khs for the nomination, appointed Fakhr-ud-daulah Fakhr- ud-d√≠n Kh√°n Shuj√°√¢t Jang Bah√°dur the fifty-eighth viceroy of Gujar√°t. The new viceroy forwarded a blank paper to a banker of his acquaintance named Sit√°r√°m, asking him to enter in it the name of a fitting deputy. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi, Deputy Viceroy.Sit√°r√°m filled in the name of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, and Fakhr-ud- daulah was proclaimed viceroy. About this time Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, after levying tribute from the S√°barmati chiefs, returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r, as he passed from Sorath to Songad, appointed Rangoji his deputy. On being appointed deputy Rangoji sent Krishn√°ji instead of Mor√°r N√°ik as his deputy to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and himself proceeded to Arhar-M√°tar on the V√°trak, and from that moved to Kaira (Kheda) to visit Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, with whom he established friendly relations. In the same year √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n, superintendent of customs, died, and in his place the author of the MirƒÉt-i- √Åhmedi was appointed. In this year, too, Pah√°r Kh√°n Jh√°lori died, and his uncle, Muhammad Bah√°dur, was appointed governor of P√°lanpur in his stead. ;Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r called to S√°t√°ra About this time Um√°b√°i, widow of Khander√°v D√°bh√°de, summoned Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r to help her in her attempt to lessen the power of the Peshwa. As D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r could not be spared from the Dakhan, Khander√°v was appointed his deputy in Gujar√°t, and he chose one R√°mchandra to represent him at √Åhmed√°b√°d. When Fakhr-ud-daulah advanced to join his appointment as viceroy he was received at B√°l√°sinor with much respect by Sher Kh√°n B√°bi. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi, on the other hand, determining to resist Fakhr-ud-daulah to the utmost of his power, summoned Gang√°dhar with a body of Mar√°tha horse from Petl√°d, and posting them at Isanpur, about ten miles south- west of the city, himself leaving the fortifications of √Åhmed√°b√°d, encamped at Asarva, about a mile and a half from the walls. During his progress towards the capital the new viceroy was joined by R√°isinghji of Idar at Kapadvanj, and, advancing together, they arrived at Bh√≠lpur, eighteen miles east of √Åhmed√°b√°d. On their approach Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n sent Safdar Kh√°n and Gang√°dhar to oppose them, and the two armies met about six miles from the capital. After some fighting Fakhr-ud-daulah succeeded in forcing his way to the suburb of R√°jpura, and next day continuing to drive back the enemy occupied the suburb of Behrampura and began the actual siege of the city. At this point affairs took a turn. Fakhr-ud-daulah was wounded and returned to his camp, while Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n succeeded in winning over to his side Sher Kh√°n B√°bi and R√°isinghji of √çdar, two of the viceroy's chief supporters. The MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi especially notes that R√°ja R√°isingh asked for money to pay his troops but Fakhr-ud- daulah, not knowing that this rule had long been a dead letter, said that as he held a district on service tenure, it was not proper for him to ask for a money aid when on imperial service. Next day Fakhr-ud-daulah was surrounded by Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi and the Mar√°th√°s, and himself one wife and some children were taken prisoners, while another of his wives and his son, who had managed to escape to Sidhpur, were captured and brought back to √Åhmed√°b√°d. ;Rangoji Disgraced by Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r After this Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r returned to Gujar√°t to receive his share of the spoil taken from Fakhr-ud-daulah. Reaching Borsad, he took Rangoji with him as far as √Åhmed√°b√°d, where he met Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, and obtained from Rangoji his share of the tribute. Khander√°v was not satisfied with Rangoji's accounts, and appointing a fresh deputy, he attached Rangoji's property, and before leaving √Åhmed√°b√°d for Sorath, put him in confinement at Borsad. He also confined Fakhr-ud-daulah in the Ghi√°spur outpost on the bank of the Mahi river. Meanwhile, in consequence of some misunderstanding between Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi and his brother Safdar Kh√°n, the latter retired to Udepur, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n went to Visalnagar (Visnagar) then in the hands of his brother Zor√°war Kh√°n. From Visalnagar, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n proceeded to Radhanpur, and meeting his brother Safdar Kh√°n, they became reconciled, and returned together to √Åhmed√°b√°d. Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r, who had in the meantime returned from Sorath, encamping at Dholka appointed Trimbakr√°v Pandit as his deputy at √Åhmed√°b√°d in place of Moro Pandit. On hearing that Rangoji had been thrown into confinement, Um√°b√°i sent for him, and he along with Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r repaired to the Dakhan. Shortly afterwards Pun√°ji Vithal, in concert with Trimbak Pandit, being dissatisfied with Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, began to intrigue with Fakhr-ud-daulah. In the meantime Um√°b√°i had appointed Rangoji as her deputy, and, as he was a staunch friend of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, he expelled Trimbakr√°v from √Åhmed√°b√°d, and himself collected the Mar√°tha share of the city revenues. Upon this Pun√°ji Vithal sent Gang√°dhar and Krishn√°ji with an army, and they, expelling the Mughal officers from the districts from which the Mar√°th√°s levied the one-fourth share of the revenue, took the management of them into their own hands. Rangoji now asked Sher Kh√°n B√°bi to help him. Sher Kh√°n agreed; but as he had not funds to pay his troops, he delayed, and afterwards plundered Mahudha and Nadiad. As Rangoji failed to join him, Sher Kh√°n proceeded by himself to Kapadvanj, and from Kapadvanj marched against the Mar√°tha camp, with which Fakhr-ud-daulah was then associated. On the night after his arrival, the Mar√°th√°s made an attack on Sher Kh√°n's camp, in which many men on both sides were slain. Next morning the battle was renewed, but on Sher Kh√°n suggesting certain terms the fighting ceased. That very night, hearing that Rangoji had reached B√°l√°sinor, Sher Kh√°n stole off towards Kapadvanj. Pun√°ji and Fakhr-ud-daulah followed in pursuit but failed to prevent Rangoji and Sher Kh√°n from joining their forces. ;Siege of Kapadvanj by Fakhr-ud-daulah, 1746 In 1746 a battle was fought in the neighbourhood of the town of Kapadvanj in which Sher Kh√°n was wounded. He was forced to take shelter with Rangoji in Kapadvanj, while Fakhr-ud-daulah, Gang√°dhar, and Krishn√°ji laid siege to that town. At this time the Lun√°v√°·∏ça chief asked Malh√°rr√°v Holkar on his way back from his yearly raid into Malwa, to join him in attacking Virpur. Holkar agreed and Virpur was plundered. Rangoji, hearing of the arrival of Holkar, begged him to come to his aid, and on promise of receiving a sum of Rupees 2 l√°khs and two elephants, Holkar consented. Gang√°dhar, Krishn√°ji, and Fakhr-ud-daulah, hearing of the approach of Holkar, raised the siege of Kapadvanj, and marching to Dholka expelled the governor of that district. Shortly afterwards on a summons from D√°m√°ji and Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r Rangoji retired to Baroda. Meanwhile, Fakhr-ud-daulah, Krishn√°ji, and Gang√°dhar advanced to Jetalpur in the Daskroi sub-division of √Åhmed√°b√°d and, taking possession of it, expelled √Åmbar Habshi, the deputy of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n. D√°m√°ji and Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r passed from Baroda to Vasu, where they were met by Krishn√°ji and Gang√°dhar, whom D√°m√°ji censured for aiding Fakhr-ud-daulah. On this occasion D√°m√°ji bestowed the districts of Baroda Na·∏çi√°d and Borsad on his brother Khander√°v, an action which for ever removed any ill feeling on the part of Khander√°v. Then, proceeding to Goklej, D√°m√°ji had an interview with Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n. From Goklej he sent K√°noji T√°kpar with Fakhr-ud-daulah to Sorath, and himself returned to Songa·∏ç. As Borsad had been given to Khander√°v, Rangoji fixed on Umreth as his residence. In this year, 1746, Teghbeg Kh√°n, governor of Surat, died, and was succeeded by his brother Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n, who, in acknowledgment of a present of seven horses, received from the emperor the title of Bah√°dur. At this time T√°lib √Åli Kh√°n died, and the writer of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi was appointed minister by the emperor. In 1747, Rangoji returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n had an interview with him a few miles from the city. Shortly after this the Kolis of Mehmudabad and Mahudha rebelled, but the revolt was speedily crushed by Sh√°hb√°z Rohilla. ;Mom√≠n Kh√°n II. Governor of Cambay, 1748 During this year Najm Kh√°n, governor of Cambay, died. Muftakhir Kh√°n, son of Najm-ud- daulah Mom√≠n Kh√°n I., who had also received the title of Mom√≠n Kh√°n II, informed the emperor of Najm Kh√°n's death, and himself assumed the office of governor in which in 1748 he was confirmed. On hearing of the death of Najm Kh√°n, on pretense of condoling with the family of the late governor, Fid√°-ud- d√≠n Kh√°n marched to Cambay, but as he was not allowed to enter the town he retired. He afterwards went to Umreth and lived with Rangoji. K√°noji T√°kpar, who had gone with Fakhr-ud-daulah into Sorath, now laid siege to and took the town of Vanthali. As it was nearly time for the Mar√°th√°s to return to their country, K√°noji and Fakhr-ud-daulah, retiring to Dholka, expelled Muhammad J√°nb√°z, the deputy governor. Rangoji, who had at this time a dispute with Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n regarding his share of tribute, now came and joined them, and their combined forces marched upon Sanand, where, after plundering the town, they encamped. It was now time for K√°noji to withdraw to the Dakhan (Deccan). Rangoji and Fakhr-ud-daulah, remaining behind to collect tribute from the neighbouring districts, marched to √çsanpur, where they were opposed by Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n. On this occasion both Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n and Fakhr-ud-daulah sought the alliance of R√°ja R√°isingh of √çdar. But, as he offered more favourable terms, R√°ja R√°isingh determined to join Fakhr-ud-daulah. Sher Kh√°n B√°bi also joined Fakhr-ud-daulah, who, thus reinforced, laid siege to √Åhmed√°b√°d. While these events were passing at √Åhmed√°b√°d, Hariba, an adopted son of Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r, at that time in possession of the fort of Borsad, began to plunder Rangoji's villages under Petl√°d, and, attacking his deputy, defeated and killed him. On this Rangoji withdrew from √Åhmed√°b√°d, attacked and captured the fort of Borsad, and forced Hariba to leave the country. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n now sent for Jan√°rdhan Pandit, Khander√°v's deputy at Na·∏çi√°d, and, in place of Rangoji's representative, appointed him to manage the Mar√°tha share of √Åhmed√°b√°d. ;Surat Affairs, 1748 During these years important changes had taken place in the government of Surat. In 1734, when Mulla Muhammad √Åli, the chief of the merchants and builder of the Athva fort, was killed in prison by Teghbeg Kh√°n, the Niz√°m sent Sayad Miththan to revenge his death. Sayad Miththan was forced to return unsuccessful. After Teghbeg Kh√°n's death, Sayad Miththan again came to Surat and lived there with his brother Sayad Achchan, who held the office of paymaster. Sayad Miththan tried to get the government of the town into his hands, but, again failing, committed suicide. His brother Sayad Achchan then attacked and took the citadel, expelling the commander; and for several days war was waged between him and the governor Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n with doubtful success. At last Sayad Achchan called to his aid Malh√°rr√°v, the deputy at Baroda, and their combined forces took possession of the whole city. During the sack of the city, Malh√°rr√°v was killed and the entire management of affairs fell into the hands of Sayad Achchan. Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n, the late governor, though obliged to leave the city, was determined not to give up Surat without a struggle, and raising some men opened fire on the fort. Sayad Achchan now begged the Arab, Turk, English, Dutch and Portuguese merchants to aid him. A deed addressed to the emperor and the Niz√°m, begging that Sayad Achchan should be appointed governor, was signed by all the merchants except by Mr. Lamb the English chief, and though he at first refused, he was in the end persuaded by the other merchants to sign. The merchants then assisted Sayad Achchan, and Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n retired to Sindh. ;Mulla Fakhr-ud-din Escapes to Bombay and Cession of Surat Revenue to the G√°ikw√°r, 1747 Sayad Achchan agreed, but on the way Mr. Lamb carried off Mulla Fakhr-ud-d√≠n to the English factory, and afterwards sent him to Bombay (now Mumbai) in disguise. In the meantime Ked√°rji G√°ikw√°r, a cousin of D√°m√°ji's, whom, with Malh√°rrav, Sayad Achchan had asked to his help, arrived at Surat, and though Sayad Achchan had been successful without his aid, Ked√°rji demanded the Rupees 3 l√°khs which had been promised him. As the Sayad was not in a position to resist Ked√°rji's demands, and as he had no ready money to give him, he made over to him a third of the revenues of Surat until the amount should be paid. As before this another third of the revenues of Surat had been assigned to H√°fiz Mas√ªud Kh√°n, the deputy of Y√°kut Kh√°n of Janjira, the emoluments of the governor of Surat were reduced to one-third of the entire revenue and this was divided between the Mutasaddi and Bakhshi. In 1747 (Samvat 1803), there was a severe shock of earthquake and a great famine which caused many deaths. In the following year, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n endeavoured to recapture Jetalpur, but failed. About the same time Um√°b√°i died, and D√°m√°ji's brother Khander√°v, who was on good terms with Ambik√°, wife of B√°bur√°v Sen√°pati, the guardian of Um√°b√°i's son, procured his own appointment as deputy of his brother D√°m√°ji in Gujar√°t. On being appointed deputy, Khander√°v at once marched against Rangoji to recover Borsad, which, as above mentioned, Rangoji had taken from Hariba. Their forces were joined by two detachments, one from Mom√≠n Kh√°n under the command of √Ågha Muhammad Husain, the other from Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n commanded by Jan√°rdhan Pandit. The combined army besieged Borsad. After a five months' siege, Borsad was taken, and Rangoji was imprisoned by Khander√°v. On the fall of Borsad Sher Kh√°n B√°bi and R√°ja R√°isingh of √çdar, who were allies of Rangoji, returned to B√°l√°sinor and √çdar; Fakhr-ud-daulah was sent to Petl√°d and Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, leaving Umreth, took shelter with Jetha, the chief of Atarsumba. In 1748, the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah died and was succeeded by his son Ahmad Shah Bahadur ().

Carne asada, one of the most popular fillings of burro percher√≥n. A burro percher√≥n is a traditional dish from the Mexican state of Sonora, originating in the cities of Hermosillo and Guaymas. A variation of the classic burrito, it is one of the most popular foods in these two cities, being offered in several establishments, both establishments and mobile food trucks, where they are offered mainly at night, although recently there are establishments that offer burro percher√≥n in its menu throughout the day. Among the main and most striking features of burro percher√≥n is that they are large in size and have a distinct taste due to the combination and concentration of the ingredients. Traditionally the burro percher√≥n are prepared with grilled or charcoal-roasted meat, avocado, Mexican cheese or chihuahua cheese , and tomatoes (although variants exist in each restaurant). At present, the number of establishments serving burros percherones are growing and there are chains that manage franchises extending to several parts of the country.  Origin  The existence of this food is relatively recent. It was rather a derivation from traditional burrito, made with wheat flour tortilla flour, in which meat is usually added to the iron and / or roasted with other variations. With the popularization of large tortillas, which are traditional in the Sierra de Sonora and locally called \\"tortillas sobaqueras\\" (because their size is a little smaller than the arm of the person who makes them), people began to experiment with them and began to prepare a new class of burrito, large and even could be taken into account as a complete meal, given their size.  Variants  They are usually accompanied by cream, vegetables (such as tomato, lemon, and avocado), Manchego cheese and a spicy sauce made from tomatoes and spices. In Hermosillo, mainly, combines many types of ingredients, such as mushrooms, tatemado chili, among others. Among the newest is the percheron drowned, bathed in tomato soup and cream, with a little cheese on top. At a Mexican restaurant called Percheronisimo, there is a challenge of a burrito that is one meter long, with 8 tortillas of flour and 1800 g of meat that has to be eaten by one person. As a prize the winner does not pay for the burrito and receives four free dinners. There are others up to two meters long. There are many ingredients and variants such as: * Pork rind * Beans * Barbecue * Chilorio * Machaca with egg * Carnitas * \\"Drowned\\" (smothered with Italian sauce). * Meat with chili * Italian (cold meats).

The suture is rather deep and well- defined, showing the gradual formation and prolongation of the slit. The aperture is oblong. The siphonal canal is short. There is no umbilicus. The transverse striae give the shell a scabrous appearance. Distribution This marine species occurs off Scotland, UK.

It is now in the Ch√¢teau-mus√©e de Boulogne-sur-Mer in France. The painter was Exekias who made this work in Athens at the end of the Archaic Period, around 530 BC. The scene shows Ajax preparing for his suicide, a unique scene in Ancient Greek art. Black-figure is a technique for pottery decoration where the painter would paint the figures in black paint and leave the background as unpainted clay. Ajax appears in the middle, bent over his sword which he is placing in the ground. There is a tree to one side of him and his suit of armor to the other side. There is a line of geometric decoration at the top of the scene and at the bottom of the amphora.  Exekias  The other side of the vase Exekias is a well-known Greek artist. He put images of the Trojan War, and Ajax in particular, on his work quite often. Ajax appears on his work more than any other Greek artist's work. Ajax was supposedly born in Salamis, which is where Exekias is believed to be from. Some scholars infer that this connection is one of the reasons Exekias chooses to depict Ajax so often. Exekias is known for being able to show tension and emotion in scenes very well.  Myth  Ajax was considered the second-best hero at Troy, after his cousin Achilles. Once Achilles dies, Ajax and Odysseus debate over who should receive his armor. When Odysseus is given the armor, Ajax goes mad. He kills Greek cattle believing that it is the Greeks. Once he becomes aware of what he has done, he commits suicide. Ajax believes that after the cattle incident, killing himself is the only way to keep his status as a hero and to avoid bringing shame to his noble father, Telamon.  Details  Most scenes in Greek art are the climax of a story, such as battles and other active subjects. However, Exekias chooses to show Ajax preparing for his suicide, which no other known images of this event do. There are other representations of Ajax's suicide, including a Middle Protocorinthian aryballos, an Athenian ivory comb, and sixth century Corinthian vases. All of these show Ajax once he has already done the act of falling on his sword. Exekias shows Ajax planting his sword in the ground. He is nude, which shows his vulnerability in this moment. A single palm tree adds to the isolation of the scene.

Rope drives use a number of circular section ropes, rather than a single flat or vee belt. Ellenroad Mill  Multiple rope drive  The first multiple rope drive was a 9-rope drive of 200 bhp produced by Combe Barbour for their Falls Foundry, Belfast, in 1863. James Combe experimented first with circular ropes laid from leather strips, then from manila hemp. The idea of using rope drives had arisen from his earlier, 1856, experiments in using a rope drive together with an expanding vee pulley, as part of a Van Doorne or Variomatic transmission. Combe Barbour were makers of textile machinery and differential speed gearing was often needed as part of the spinning process, where one shaft could be smoothly adjusted to run slightly faster or slower than another.  Usage  Rope drives were most widely used for power-transmission in mills and factories, where a single mill engine would have a large rope drive to each floor, where lineshafts across each floor distribute power to the individual machines. These multiple rope drives replaced the earlier technique of a vertical wrought iron shaft with bevel gears at each floor. They remained in use for as long as mills were driven by central steam engines, rather than individual electric motors. Some were used with early electric motors, where these were large single motors driving a whole floor of machinery. A 1907 installation at Droylesden split the output of one motor between two floors with two new rope drives. Rope drives were rarely used in the internal-combustion era, although some were used with gas engines running on producer gas. A Yorkshire mill converted to use a 1,000 hp Allen diesel engine in 1938, and retained the rope drives. Shaft drives had often used gearing from the engines to increase their speed, and thus their power transmission. This was avoided for rope drives, as the rope's maximum useful speed could be achieved from the engine's flywheel and flexibility of the ropes led to backlash in the gearing.  Power  Power transmitted was typically 50 bhp per rope, for ropes working at 5,000 feet / minute. Groups of ropes could drive different floors and they also allowed individual ropes to be replaced separately, and without losing all power to a mill floor after a rope breakage. US practice sometimes used a single rope, looped between floors and tensioned by an idler pulley, but this system was not used in the UK and each loop was tensioned between its two pulleys by one of them being movable. Rope drives were also cheaper than belts - around a quarter of the price.  Factory power distribution  hydroelectric plant Multiple rope drives driving lineshafts on each factory floor The rope drives were placed in a large diagonal shaft at the side of the building, usually windowless and distinctively visible from outside the building. Rope drives required a larger such shaft than comparable belt or shaft drives. As the open shaft represented a channel for transmitting fires, unlike the narrow holes of a shaft drive, it needed careful fireproofing from the loom floors. It was sometimes arranged for large drives that the engine drove a set of horizontal ropes to a pulley on a layshaft or 'second motion shaft' alongside the engine house, then diagonally up through the shaft.

History UA92 was announced in September 2017 and offers ‚Äúbroader courses than traditional degrees, designed to enhance life skills as well as employability‚Äù. Degrees have a focus on personal and character development, and the skills needed for the workplace. UA92 was co-founded by Lancaster University and members of the Class of '92, the Manchester United football players who won the 1992 FA Youth Cup, including Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. Following their successful careers after football, the players wanted to open a university which would attract students who \\"otherwise might not go on to higher education\\". The approval by the Department of Education to allow UA92 the use of 'University Academy 92' was questioned with critics claiming the decision to approve the use of the name makes it 'too easy' for new providers to use ‚Äòuniversity‚Äô in a new institution's name. UA92 works in partnership with industry to develop a curriculum inspired by business needs. Current partners include Microsoft, Trafford College, KPMG and Lancashire Cricket Club. Legal dispute In July 2018 it was revealed that UA92 had filed a lawsuit against Brendan Flood, who founded the University Campus of Football Business (UCFB). The lawsuit claimed trademark infringement after Flood incorporated a series of companies and trademarks using the name UA92 soon after the announcement of University Academy 92, and sought at injunction to stop Flood using the name. The campus The plans were approved by Trafford Council in a vote in January 2018. The main campus (previously Kellogg's HQ) is currently under refurbishment and will open in September 2019. It will be located on Brian Statham Way and will eventually cater for up to 6,500 students. Local opinion on the project was divided as it reached the planning application stage. UA92 will take up space in the building on a phased basis initially occupying the ground and first floors, totalling circa 50,000 sq ft. There is also an option for the university to take the upper two floors, again totalling around 50,000 sq ft, in subsequent academic years. In August 2018 the campus plans were approved by Trafford Council and work commenced in October 2018 on converting the former Kellogg's building into UA92's campus. The campus was officially launched on 20 September 2019 and the first hundred students started in October 2019.https://www.insidermedia.com/insider/northwest/ua92-campus-officially- launcheshttps://www.technologyrecord.com/Article/university- academy-92-welcomes-its-first-students-87411 Academic profile Degree programmes UA92 is promoting six undergraduate degrees for September 2019 entry - Accounting and Finance, Business Studies, Journalism, Media and Communications, Physical Education and Sports Science. Further courses will launch in 2020, including Computer Science and Sports Management. Students apply via UCAS. Certificates in Higher Education (CertHE) are also offered.

S.Amdt. 1030 was introduced on September 13, 2017, sponsored by Lindsey Graham (R-SC), with Bill Cassidy (R-LA) as a co-sponsor, after whom the amendment is named. The other three co-sponsors are Dean Heller (R-NV), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Roy Blunt (R-MO). The amendment would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. It would also return control of the Medicaid program to the states and cap the program's funding. The amendment would also redistribute federal money differently to different states, with some states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA (which are generally Democratic) losing federal money to states that did not (which are generally Republican). In May 2017, late night comedy host Jimmy Kimmel shared with his audience that his son was born with tetralogy of Fallot, a birth defect of the heart. Shortly after, Cassidy began claiming that he wanted any health care bill to pass what he dubbed the \\"Jimmy Kimmel test,\\" which he defined as \\"would a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything he or she would need in that first year of life?\\" Most analysts of the bill stated that this bill violated the test, which led Kimmel to condemn it on his show and urge his viewers to contact their representatives to oppose it. On September 26, 2017, Politico reported that Republican leadership in the Senate had decided not to put the bill up for a floor vote.Kim, Seung Min; Haberkorn, Jennifer; Everett, Burgess. \\"Senate won‚Äôt vote on last-ditch Obamacare repeal bill\\".

Senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and John McCain (R-AZ) published statements stating their intention to vote against the bill. McCain's opposition reportedly left Republican leaders with \\"little hope\\" of getting the bill passed. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) indicated they are unlikely to support the bill. Cruz speculated that Mike Lee (R-UT) is unlikely to vote for the bill.

From 16 June 1941 to 5 May 1943, he was Chief of Office of Naval Intelligence, Naval War Command () in the Oberkommando der Marine. Maertens was known for underestimating British intelligence, and specifically, overrating the security of the Naval Enigma cipher machine. In 1941, he held a naval enquiry into the strength of Naval Enigma security after the capture of U-boat U-570, and attributed all the suspicious losses in U-boats at the time to the British Huff-Duff. In the second enquiry, ordered by the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy () Karl D√∂nitz, in May 1943, he investigated a number of areas, in which exculpated Enigma security in the end, for the second time, incorrectly blaming British 9.7 centimetre centimetric radar for the massive losses in U-boats by mid 1943. Naval career In 1 April 1910, Maertens joined the Imperial German Navy as a Seekadett and had basic training on the heavy cruiser until 31 March 1911. He was promoted to an officer candidate rank () and sent to the German Imperial Naval Academy Naval Academy M√ºrwik for Naval training until 30 September 1912. In September 1913, he was promoted to Midshipman () when his training was competed. From 1 October 1912 to 7 October 1915, Maertens was posted to the liner Hessen to learn the sailing characteristics of large ships and their movements. On 8 September, Maertens started submarine and radio training, and later posted as a watch officer on the U-boat U-3 on 17 October 1915. He completed his submarine training on 26 February 1916, promoted on 22 March 1916 to Oberleutnant zur See, and was posted to U-boat U-47 as the watch officer the day after. He was subsequently posted to U-48, to take up the same post, until 24 November 1917, when U-48 ran aground on Goodwin Sands, where the submarine was fired on by and was scuttled and abandoned. Maertens and 17 other submariners of U-48 were taken as prisoners, and held in captivity until 5 November 1919. After being released, Maertens was subordinated to the battleship for a month as a watch officer. In early 1920, he was posted to Baltiysk for two months as a Naval Signals Officer. On 1 January 1921, he was promoted to captain lieutenant, (), an officer grade of the captains military hierarchy group. On 1 March 1921, Maertens was ordered to be acting leader of the service office at K√∂nigsberg. On 7 April 1921, he was subordinated as Adjutant and Naval Signals Officer to the Commander of the naval base at ≈öwinouj≈õcie. In October 1921, he was posted to the Coastal Defence Battalion I as company leader where he stayed until March 1925. On 1 January 1921, Maertens was promoted to captain lieutenant (). On 17 March 1925, he was subordinated to the commander of the Torpedo and Mining Academy in Kiel where he stayed until 14 August 1928. From 15 August 1928 to 30 September 1934, he was the department head of the Naval Shipyard of the Naval Command (). In October 1934, Maertens was promoted to Frigate captain, (), which was the senior middle rank of the Kriegsmarine. From 1934 to 1936, he was Commander of the Naval Academy M√ºrwik. He was then posted to the Bureau of Inspection of the torpedo Service in Kiel as Director of Staff until 30 September 1937. During the same period he was ordered to be Acting Inspector of Torpedo Affairs until 17 April 1937. From October 1937 to April 1939, Maertens was Director of Staff of Inspections in Naval Signals and, order again, on a temporary basis, to be Acting Inspector of Naval Signals from May 1938 to March 1939. He then became leader and subsequent Commander of the Communication Test Institute of the OKM from 28 April 1939 to 18 November 1939. He was again promoted to Director of the Technical Signals Affairs in the Naval Weapons Office in the Oberkommando der Marine from 19 November 1939 to 15 June 1941. On 1 July 1940, Maertens was promoted to rear admiral, Konteradmiral, and on 1 September 1942, promoted to Vizeadmiral. From 19 June 1941 to 5 May 1943, he was promoted to Group Director of the Naval Intelligence Service, ( III) of the Oberkommando der Marine (OKM/4 SKL III). From 6 May 1943 to June 1943 Maertens was Acting Shipyard Director of the Kriegsmarine shipyard in Kiel. From 28 November 1944 to 28 February 1945, he was placed at the disposal of Oskar Kummetz who was the Baltic Sea regional commander. Maertens retired on 28 February 1945. Enigma Security Enquiries Maertens was a career navy signals officer who was promoted to the Director of the Naval Intelligence Command () in June 1941. It was during a time when the B-Dienst, the Naval Intelligence department of the Kriegsmarine, was the most active. In May 1941, Captain Ludwig Stummel, who was Group Director of Naval Warfare department, was a subordinate of Maertens. After sinking eight destroyers and the U-boat U-13 in April‚ÄìMay 1940, Stummel started a probe into the sinking. Vice admiral Karl D√∂nitz requested confirmation that the sinking of the submarine effected the change in movement of a convoy that was targeted, and was specifically asking for assurances of Enigma M's security. Konteradmiral Erhard Maertens, coming to the aid of his subordinate, stated that four events would need to occur, which would make it highly unlikely: # That U-boat submariners, who were threatened with capture or destruction, did not destroyed the Enigma machinery or changed the configuration. # That water- soluble ink would not work. # That the enemy could detect the difference between the settings and those of the key list. # That the British Admiralty could solve B-Dienst messages and extract the correct intelligence to enable the convoy to avoid the U-boats. Maertens believed that these events were taken alone were unlikely, but when combined would be impossible. A bombing raid was ordered in an attempt to ensure that the U-13 and all associated Key M (i.e. Enigma cipher machine) infrastructures were destroyed. The crew of one of the planes noticed that the site of the U-13 was marked by buoys, indicating perhaps, the submarine had not been salvaged. This was stated in the official report. In that case, the British Admiralty did not recover any Key M material or machinery. 1941 Investigation Maertens was ordered to lead a formal enquiry into the \\"control and investigation of own processes\\" when in August 1941, U-boat U-570, later renamed to HMS Graph by the Admiralty occurred, was captured, potentially leaking German secure communication details (i.e. Key M secrets to the British Admiralty). This was considered by Naval Intelligence to be a progression and continuation of previous investigations and probes, a process that existed since the Naval Enigma cipher machine was introduced. One of these investigations had been conducted by Kurt Fricke, Chief of Naval War Command, on another incident, the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck on 27 May 1941, caused great consternation in the Kriegsmarine, which resulted in a number of changes to Enigma cipher processes. On 18 October 1941, Maertens completed his analysis of the security consequences by stating in his report that \\"a current reading of our messages is not possible.\\" On the next page, however, he conceded that if the enemy had found the Enigma cipher machine untouched with all key documents, a current reading was possible. The U-boats routinely carried between two and three months worth of daily key settings, so the enemy could have used U-570's material to read enciphered messages until November 1941. If these documents had fallen into enemy hands, the Maerten's results would be that \\"without doubt a weakening of the security of our cipher.\\" He concluded that having enough time to drench the documents would be unlikely, making their water- soluble ink unreadable. In the end, he left the impression that the British were not solving Enigma messages. In fact, once captured, a search of U-570 was conducted and useful papers had missed destruction, by the departed German crew. Copies of encrypted signals and their corresponding plain-language German texts were in fact discovered by the British. The U-570 papers included all supporting documentations for the Naval Key M ciphers. Maertens's verdict in his final report had some very worrying conclusions: > We have to accept that the U-570 might have been captured by the enemy > without anything having been destroyed. In these circumstances it cannot be > ruled out that... a large amount of cipher documents are in enemy's hands. > If this is true, the security of our enciphering procedure has been > weakened... Out cipher will have been compromised if, as well as the enemy > capturing the codebooks, our officers, who are now POW's have told the enemy > the keyword, which since June 1941 has been given verbally to the U-boat > commander so that he could alter the printed list of Enigma settings. If > that has occurred, then we have to accept that our radio messages are being > read by the enemy...The same would be true if the keyword had been written > down in breach of regulations, and the codebooks and the keyword had fallen > into enemy hands, or if, for example, the settings arrived at by the keyword > order were written on the original settings list. If this happened, the > enemy could work out the meaning of the keyword. =1941 Tarafal Bay Action= The action in Tarrafal Bay worried Donitz and another investigation was launched by Maertens. He noted that the U-boat U-111 had detailed a meeting point in a message transmitted on 23 September 1941, which was four days before the ambush. Maertens stated that \\"if U-111 message was read, then there would be an attempt to disturb the meeting.\\" However, he again shied away from directly suggesting that Key M infrastructure had been compromised. He could not believe that the British could not make such a mess of the attack in such favourable conditions if the Naval Enigma cipher had been broken. On 24 October 1941, Maertens overall conclusion was stated in a letter to Donitz: > The acute disquiet about the compromise of our Secret Operation cannot be > justified. Our cipher does not appear to be broken. In fact, the Naval Intelligence Division had solved a message intercepted from U-111, and the Admiralty had dispatched the submarine to destroy the U-boats in the Bay of Tarrafal on the island of Santo Ant√£o. 1943 Investigation In February and March 1943, Admiral D√∂nitz met with Adolf Hitler four times to discuss the Battle of the Atlantic, and the point that the Allies probably know the location of U-boat groups as they were routing the convoys around the U-boat packs. It was strongly suspected that the Allies broke the cipher machine, and again, Maertens was asked to conduct another enquiry. He again assured D√∂nitz and exculpated the Enigma cipher machine security. Around the same time, documents were discovered in French Resistance agent stations, showing that the Allies were obtaining information from the resistance on departure times for U-boats and whether they were going north or south, enabling the foe. Maertens thought to estimate submarine movements with some accuracy. The discovery of centimetric radar, on a downed British bomber in Rotterdam, which operated on a wavelength of 9.7 cm, supported his assumptions. The radar assumed that British aeroplanes could detect the U-boat while surfaced without alerting the U-boat and could attack them by surprise. Indeed, the Royal Air Force had begun to do that in the Bay of Biscay, but not anywhere else. D√∂nitz accepted Maertens view that the Enigma Key M infrastructure was secure. D√∂nitz wrote in his war diary: > With the exception of two of three doubtful cases, enemy information about > the position of our U-boats appears to have been obtained mainly from > extensive use of airborne radar, and the resultant plotting of these > positions has enabled him [the enemy] to organize effective diversion of > convoy traffic. In early May 1943, Maertens was fired by D√∂nitz for reasons that was beyond his fears about crypto-security and sent him to run the Kriegsmarine shipyard in Kiel. =Stichwort procedure= One reason for Maertens and the Kriegsmarine's very high confidence in the Enigma cipher machine was the incorporation of a secret procedure that they believed would thwart any possibility of cracking the code. This was the Stichwort permutation (), a procedure the Kriegsmarine had introduced that completely altered the Naval Enigma cipher machine's inner and outer key settings that were given on the printed settings list.Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, Enigma: The Battle For The Code, p. 235 References 1891 births 1945 deaths Naval history of World War II Reichsmarine personnel U-boat commanders (Imperial Navy) Vice admirals of the Kriegsmarine People from G≈Çog√≥w Kriegsmarine personnel Imperial German Navy personnel of World War I ","title":"Erhard Maertens"},{"id":"55305324","text":"Wilfrid Wolters McVittie (May 24, 1906 - September 17, 1980) was Ambassador Extraordinary And Plenipotentiary of Great Britain to the Dominican Republic from 1958 to 1962.

O. spinifer is one of two species in the ant genus Odontomachus to have been described from fossils found in Dominican amber and is one of a number of Odontomachus species found in the Greater Antilles. History and classification Odontomachus spinifer is known from a solitary fossil insect which, along with a microhymenopteran, is an inclusion in a transparent yellow chunk of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America, and up to southern Mexico. The specimen was collected from an undetermined amber mine in fossil- bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains of northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera, and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene as the age range is only the youngest that it might be. At the time of description, the holotype specimen, number \\"Do-2215\\", was preserved in the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart amber collections in Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The holotype fossil was first studied by entomologist Maria L.

The specific epithet spinifer is derived from the Latin word which means \\"bearing a spine\\", a reference to the large projection on the top of the petiole. The O. spinifer holotype head Based on the head structure, O. spinifer was suggested to be part of the O. haematodus species group, closely placed with the species O. affinis, O. mayi, and O. panamensis. The three modern species are from Brazil and Guyana up through Panama and Costa Rica. The two modern species found on the island of Hispaniola, O. bauri and O. insularis are not closely placed to O. spinifer, having different structuring of the heads upper surface. When first described, O. spinifer was one of two Odontomachus species that had been described from fossils. It and Odontomachus pseudobauri were both described by De Andrade from Dominican amber in the same paper. A third species Odontomachus paleomyagra, the first compression fossil species, was described in 2014 from a worker found in Priabonian age lignite deposits of the Most Basin, Czech Republic. Description The O. spinifer worker is approximately in length, and has a shining exoskeleton of yellowish red to reddish brown tones. The smooth exoskeleton has tiny punctuation found across the top of the head, mandibles, petiole node and the gaster. In contrast the frons, antennae depressions, pronotum, mesonotum and underside of the petiole are distinguished by varying degrees of striation. The head is large with a rectangular outline, being 2/3 longer than wide, with the rear margin of the head wider than the maximum width of the pronotum. The mandibles are almost as long as the head is wide and the chewing margin has twelve teeth increasing in size towards the tip, while the apex of each has three teeth, a preapical, intercalary, and an apical tooth. The antennae have notably long scapes that extend past the rear margin of the head capsule and curve slightly along their length. The first funicular segments of the antennae are double the length of the second segment and longer than any of the other 10 segments. The mesonotum and propodeum have an elongated slender profile, as does the petiole, while the gaster is bell shaped along the connection with the petiole and the sting is partially retracted. There is a notably large backward curving spine formed from the upper surface of the petiole, being longer than the width of the petiole.

Monarch Place is the tallest building in Springfield, the tallest building in Massachusetts outside of Boston, and the eighth tallest building in New England. Originally built by the namesake Monarch Capital Corporation, at the time of its completion in 1989 it was the largest mixed-use development in Massachusetts outside of Boston. History Monarch Place was built on the site of the Forbes and Wallace Inc. Department Store, commencing construction in 1987. In a tribute to preserve the heritage of Forbes and Wallace, whose flagship store had stood at that site for decades, the architects Jung Brannen and Associates developed a replica of that building's facade, used in tandem with a fountain at a plaza at the corners of Main and Boland. The building was originally constructed as a joint venture between the Monarch Capital Corporation's \\"Forge Springfield\\" subsidiary, Flatley Springfield of Braintree, and Sheraton Hotels at a cost of $120 million dollars. After Monarch Capital's bankruptcy in 1991, the building was sold at auction for $24 million dollars to Peter L. Picknelly, of Peter Pan Buslines, whose company has managed it since.

It is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 5.1. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 10.48 mas as seen from Earth, it is located around 310 light years from the Sun. It is moving away from the Sun with a radial velocity of 10.4 km/s. Primary star The primary component is a B-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of B9 V. It is a type of chemically peculiar star known as an HgMn star, which means it shows surface overabundancies of certain elements including mercury and manganese, and deficiencies in others including helium, cobalt, and so forth. The star has about three times the mass of the Sun and is radiating 87 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of about 10,500 K. The reconstruction of the surface of Phi Phoenicis by Doppler imaging showed it to be heterogeneous with regions of different elemental abundances. In particular, the star forms spots with high or low abundances of yttrium, strontium, titanium, and chromium. The comparison of the abundance maps in different epoches revealed that the spot configurations vary on monthly or yearly time scales. The spectral lines of the irregularly distributed elements show variations that allowed a precise rotation period of 9.53 days to be determined, and also show evidence of long term abundance changes. The analysis of the spots suggests that the rotation axis is inclined to the line of sight by an angle of about 53¬∞, and shows evidence of very weak differential rotation. The starspots probably cause milimagnitude variations in the brightness of Phi Phoenicis, even though there are no precise observations to confirm this. The origin of the starspots and chemical anomalies in HgMn stars is uncertain and has generated controversy. Typically, such as for Ap and Bp stars, inhomogeneously distributed elements are attributed to be large-scale organized magnetic fields, but there are not conclusive detection of magnetic fields in HgMn stars. In 2012, a study claimed to have detected a weak magnetic field in Phi Phoenicis correlated with the spots, but this has been contested. It is believed that diffusion processes in the atmosphere may be related to the chemical anomalies, but this does not explain quantitatively the observed variations. Secondary star Phi Phoenicis is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 1126 days and an eccentricity of 0.59. There is no evidence for additional stars in the system, but in the past this has been considered a triple system, due to the detection of the wrong spectroscopic period. The variability of the radial velocity of Phi Phoenicis was discovered in the first spectroscopic observations of the star in 1911, and was confirmed in 1982, but the data were still inclusive and no orbit was determined. The first orbital solution was finally published in 1999, yielding a period of 41.4 days. At the same time, in 1997, the Hipparcos Catalogue was published revealing Phi Phoenicis to be an astrometric binary with an estimated period of 878 days (circular orbit solution). Thus Phi Phoenicis became a triple star system, with a visible star, a spectroscopic companion, and an astrometric companion. A 2013 study, with new high-resolution radial velocity data from the FEROS, HARPS and CORALIE spectrographs, showed that the period of the spectroscopic orbit is actually closer to 1126 days, and not 41.4 days; this indicates that the spectroscopic companion is the same one that the astrometric data detected. In the same year another study fitted the astrometric data to the spectroscopic orbit, revealing the orbital inclination of the system and allowing to estimate the properties of the secondary star. The orbit of the system is highly eccentricity and is seen almost side-on, with an inclination of 93 ¬± 4.7¬∞. The high uncertainty means that the occurrence of eclipses is possible, despite being unlikely. From this inclination and assuming a mass of 3.0 for the primary, the binary mass function can be used to calculate a mass of 0.91 for the secondary. The secondary star is assumed to be a yellow dwarf with an effective temperature around 5,500 K, and is 5.7 visual magnitudes fainter than the primary. The average separation between the two star is estimated at around 3.4 AU.

The game consists of boarding procedurally generated spaceships from a top-down perspective. Gameplay Heat Signature is an action and stealth video game played from a top-down view. Players take control of a member of a group of space mercenaries who embarks on a variety of missions such as hijacking space vessels, stealing technology, assassinating crew members, rescuing captives, and more. Operating from a central base, mercenaries take on missions that require the player to fly the mercenary via a small shuttlecraft to a travelling ship, dock with it, and then infiltrate the ship and return to home base safely. The ultimate goal is to liberate the strongholds of each of the four factions in a randomly- generated nebula. The nebula serves as a tech tree, allowing the player, with each liberation, to unlock various items, such as guns, gadgets, explosives, or pods. Each station within the nebula also includes a defector mission, which are specially developed missions that, in a way, operate as different challenges for the player to attempt; as they offer no monetary gain, these missions are typically completed out of leisure or as a way to practice for standard missions. The layouts of the nebulae, the ships, their crew, and missions are procedurally generated, similar to games of the roguelike genre. Normally, the game operates in real time. At any time, the player can pause the game, which then provides a menu screen that provides additional options for the player to perform, such as switching weapons, picking up or dropping inventory items, or taking remote control of the shuttle, as well as to plan their next move, such as selecting a target for their attack. This can be done indefinitely, allowing for stunts such as picking up the weapon of a fallen enemy, equipping it, and using it against another target all while in this pause screen. Thus, the game often becomes much more about prediction and somewhat turn-based strategy rather than devising and implementing tactics in real time. Development and release Heat Signature was developed by Suspicious Developments, a team led by former PC Gamer editor Tom Francis. Development took about three years starting around December 2013, and cost around . The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 21 September 2017. At the time of release, Francis knew that releasing the game was \\"biggest risk of [his] life\\", as the indie game market was saturated with titles. He had hoped to see at least half the sales that he got with Gunpoint. Within the first week, he reported that the sales of Heat Signature had exceeded those of Gunpoint, and that the game was one of the top sellers on Steam during its initial week.  Post-Launch Updates  After avoiding criticism of Heat Signature for two weeks after release, Tom Francis agreed with many of the caveats in the other-wise positive reviews, saying in a blog post \\"almost every critique I read I thought was a fair point.\\" Three months after launch the Fair Points update was released with fixes to these issues. To celebrate the one year anniversary of Heat Signature's launch the Space Birthday update was released. It is the largest update the game has received, spending five months in development. The update was dedicated to the late John Francis, Tom's father, who died during development. Most notably the Space Birthday update added a daily challenge, and a full list of changes can be found here. Tom Francis has stated that Heat Signature will not be receiving regular updates, with all post-launch content being \\"once-offs.\\" Reception Heat Signature was nominated for \\"Best Action Game\\" at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.
